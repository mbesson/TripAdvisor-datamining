We upgraded to a superior room when we booked this trip but that was a waste of $. I emailed ahead of time with some of our needs (travelling with a 2 and a 5 yr old) but have to date not received a reply nor was any record of it at the front desk when we arrived. My only big complaint was the condition of the bath tub. It was cracked and not one you would want to bathe little ones in. The food was good and plenty of variety. You do have to keep and eye on the beach towels they provide. People take them and then you have to spend time getting another towel card and signing a slip that if you loose them again you will have to pay $35 per towel. There are people with white braclets that are day users, nearby residents. The drinks were weak but if you pay the $18 per day upgrade you get the premium liquor. The staff were all friendly. Beautiful grounds and beach. Not enough negative aspects to stop one from coming back.

Our family of 4 including an 11 year old and a 14 year old loved everything about it. How much we liked the small size of the resort was a real surprise, as we usually stay in much bigger places and I was worried that the Reef would be too small. Turns out that having your room 30 seconds from the beach is a great thing! We loved the sun beds on the beach and around the pool (although there is a shortage of both and we had to play the save early game). This resort is really separated into 2 parts: The pool, beach zone which is very interesting and visually pleasing and the \"jungle zone' that had lovely paths leading to the lobby and to the pools. The pool area is tiered on 4 levels with a few steps in between. This provides a lovely view as well as breeze to the upper pool areas. The pools were a nice temperature and 1 had a swim up bar. Speaking of bars, the drinks were great. I only drank mojitos and they were awesome. My husband liked the beer and wine with dinner. There were minimal lines at any bar and this is during March Break. Bartenders, as well as all service staff, were lovely. We enjoyed the food in the buffet restaurant very much. The view was also beautiful (pool and beach) and if you sat out on the terrace, the breeze was great. We also ate at the a la cartes, which were very good (we enjoyed the Grill more than the Italian). It was great not to have to get reservations but to just walk in whenever we wanted. To be honest though, we loved the buffet better. Great fresh fruit in the morning as well as omelets and fresh baked cinnamon rolls (my weakness, I ate 3 every morning with my coffee, which was very good).Lunch and dinner had lots of selection and always had something Mexican which we loved. One unique and sweet feature of the Reef was the ice cream parlour in the 'jungle'. Only open from 4-6 every afternoon, my son and I went everyday. Our favourite flavours were chocolate chip, coconut and almond. There was also a coffee lounge close by (right in the middle of the jungle) with delicious specialty coffees and snacks. The only area that was a little less than impressive was the lobby. We were quite underwhelmed when we arrived, however we soon realized how unimportant this really is. Some huge resorts we've been to had spectacular, grand lobbies but needing to take a shuttle between buffet and your room numerous times a day soon got very tired. I will mention that we did not get the room I requested and upgrades were not available so the 4 of us stayed in the double room which was rather tight. We had no complaints about the rooms, ie. bedding was very nice, pillows were nice and fluffy, water pressure was good, balcony was cute. Our room was in the jungle so it was a bit dark but there was very good lighting in the room especially for reading. There was no service or guest noises at night which is very important. In the future I would like to book a 1 bedroom apartment although I don't know if those are only for timeshare people (couldn't really get a clear answer from the front desk).. The beach and water was spectacular. Fantastic waves! We had perfect weather the whole week so that always helps. My son and husband participated in the beach volleyball most days. We walked to Playa Del Carmen several times (beach and street). Both were an easy 15 min. walk. We enjoyed looking at all the beautiful houses on the way but 5th Avenue was a bit of a disappointment to me. Too commercial, and too many huge stores. We did enjoy eating at Senior Frogs which is great for kids. In the future when we go back I would like to try some of the non-touristy restaurants and see the 'real' side of PDC. We went on 1 excursion, Xel-ha, which was awesome! Cliff jumping, zip lining and snorkeling among many other activities (we went for a full day) kept the kids busy all day. My husband and son went diving several times and have nothing but praise for the dive master, David and the Reef Marina. My husband and daughter went parasailing as well and loved it. Overall we greatly enjoyed our week here and plan on returning next year with some relatives.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minnesota, USA", "Title": "\u201cExcellent choice for group vacation.\u201d", "Author": "farmersfrommn", "ReviewID": "UR126495507", "Content": "Our group of 15 just returned from a 7 day stay at The Reef Playacar. We were a group of parents and our 18 year olds on a \u201cSpring Break\u201d vacation. I want to point out that it's NOT a typical college \"Spring Break\" destination and there were NO typical college kids or \"spring-breakers\" there and we knew this ahead of time. We chose this resort for it\u2019s location, smaller size, beach, and affordable price for an A.I. and we were not disappointed. The three BEST features of this resort are the BEACH , LOCATION and the SERVICE, which is exactly what many other visitors have reported. I would like to describe our experience by topic. Check \u2013in and rooms: Our group arrived at around noon and 2 rooms were ready and 2 were not, which we really didn\u2019t have a problem with since we arrived earlier than the 3:00 check in time. Don't be surprised if people who \"don't know how to wait their turn\" butt in line. It happens a LOT at resorts in Mexico, and it just comes with the experience, don't sweat it ! We all put our things in one room , changed clothes and hit the beach/pool. The rest of the accommodations were lined up just fine, with some of our party having \u201csuites\u201d to accommodate everyone conveniently since we had the group of teens with us. This worked out very well for our group. Rooms were clean and comfortable and the housekeeping service did an excellent job each day. I asked for additional bottles of water , and were supplied extra each day. Service: There were so many friendly staff members everywhere, it\u2019s almost impossible to name them all. Always ready with a smile and \u201cHola\u201d everywhere we went. Buffet tables and service , BARTENDERS , wait staff , and entertainment personnel ALL top-notch . Special thank you to Humbierto at the swim-up bar and Orlando at the roof-top bar who took such good care of us, remembered what we liked to drink, kept up with the requests even when VERY busy and put up with our crazy \u201cbar games\u201d and 18 year olds ( and some of us 50 year olds ) !!! We always tipped our servers, they work very hard and deserve it\u2026and at times, there was a slight wait for a drink but they usually only had one bartender on duty so it was hard for him to keep up at \u201crush\u201d times. As a suggestion, there should be 2 bartenders at the lobby bar when the 5:00-7:00 rush occurs as people are trying to get drinks before dinner, or going out for the evening. The Beach: This beach is AMAZING. Huge, lots of room to walk down and up all the way to Play del Carmen ( 15 min walk ) the white soft sand and blue clear water are what go there for. We were not disappointed. There is a bit of an inconvenience in getting a beach or poolside chair. If you are not out there by 6:30 \u2013 7:00 am, good luck ! We had a large group, and usually had to split up, and it was difficult to get chairs with shade. There were LOTS of chairs \u201csaved\u201d with towels and nobody sitting in them most of the time. They do allow outside guests to purchase day passes, so this may account for the over occupancy of visitor-to-chair ratio. Food: The Buffet was best at breakfast, and often lunch too. More crowded at lunch than dinner. Always found something we liked, even in our large group. The boys, particularly , ate VERY well considering all the yummy choices at the snack bar near the pool as well. Nobody went hungry! We enjoyed the Italian restaurant twice, and our whole group was even seated together outside terrace which was really nice. On Tuesday night the buffet was closed and the Show Room was transformed into a huge Mexican buffet and show. There was an abundance of Mexican dishes to choose from, but if that\u2019s not your favorite you were a little out of luck that night. Location: One of the main reasons we chose this resort was for the location to Playa. 5 minute 7.00 ( USD ) cab ride or 15 minute walk. Our kids all wanted to shop and do a little \u201cnight life\u201d in Playa so we went into town 4 of the evenings usually after eating and drinking as much \u201cfree\u201d at the resort first. There is really no night life at the Reef ( which we knew ) except for the nice , low-key roof top bar open until 2:00 am, which was perfectly fine for us several of the nights. This terrace overlooked the beautiful and quiet neighborhood of the Playacar gated community on the street side, and the resort grounds on the other. Additionally, I would like to add that the buildings and grounds were beautiful and the jungle-like setting was very scenic and comfortable. Just take a look at the pictures, it\u2019s much more beautiful in real life! We would return to the Reef again, and certainly recommend to others who are looking for a smaller A.I. , great location, great beach, with everything you need, and not expecting a big \u201cnight life\u201d atmosphere. The Reef Playacar certainly fits the bill.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis", "Title": "\u201cGreat Vacation!\u201d", "Author": "MominMN66", "ReviewID": "UR126426391", "Content": "My daughter and I just returned from a wonderful 11 day stay at The Reef Playacar. The resort is definitely on the small side as far as AI's go, but the service was top notch and not having to walk long distances to get places was great. The food was pretty standard for this level AI, but the two ala carte restaurants were good and since they didn't require reservations, we could decide our dinner plans late in the day rather than scheduling ahead of time. I have to give a special thanks to Vita and Daniel at the front desk for helping with my special room requests - they were very accommodating and managed to handle our requests even though the resort was booked to capacity at a peak time. The Sports and Entertainment staff was very friendly and tried to get the guests to participate in scheduled activities as much as possible. My daughter really enjoyed Jesus, Sara, and Mariela and beach volleyball in the afternoons. We didn't see many of the shows, but I would recommend the Michael Jackson one to anyone that sees it on the calendar. Casino night was fun too, just be prepared for non-Vegas rules :) The one downside for us was that there is no real nightlife to speak of on the resort. There is a bar that is open late, but no \"disco\" as in most of the other resorts, just pool tables. We met some others during our stay and made our own fun at the bar. Thanks to Orlando and Erick for putting up with our group and even remembering what I wanted to drink! The pool bar was fun, but allowing little kids next to the bar seemed a little out of place. Humberto at the pool bar did a great job keeping up even when it was busy. The snack bar had pretty standard food and was open late, which was great for the later nights after the buffet was closed.

The resort offered the usual all inclusive stuff, but we found that even though some of the reviews were not happy with the food was not the problem, we found it very good and even my husband who will not eat everything was very happy. We tried both of the restaurants and enjoyed our meal without reservations which I am very happy with because it always puts a damper on things when on vacation you have to make a schedule.

They said A/C in room was not working and they didnt want to put me in room like that and my room was gonna be ready first thing in the morning the next day. They made me and my girlfriend stay in different hotel across the street. Room there was in bad shape and had dirty covers, and pillows so we asked for clean ones and never got them. We checked out of that hotel around 9am and went back to the Reef Playcar and they told us that we have to wait till people check out of our room, which is noon, n we can have the room.We had to change in lobby bathroom! Imagine how nice our vacation started. So this means they LIED first day when they said A/C wasnt working. They told me that they wanted to make it up to me and they will put extra and special things in my room. however i didnt find anything extra or special in my room and after coppola day i found out that extra and special was a coffee maker because other room did not have them \"wow man i felt so special\". It was so disapointing. Next day someone stole my girlfriends bikini from the balcony so we went to the front desk and asked if maybe wind blew it away and maybe they had it in lost and found. First they could not locate bell boy who had a key to the lost and found place so we had to wait till next day to go ask them again. They said nothing was found and they told us to make report and talk to coustumer service which we did and were told that they will talk to us in 2 days and and they will c what they can do and i also told costumer service about expirience we had first day and lady was so \"supprised\" and she say she didnt know nothing about it. Only after 2 hours they left a note in our room saying \"We would like to inform you that the hotel is not responsible for the loss of the belongings out of the safe box\" So in another words that means they can clean out your whole room and not be responsible for it. And it very obvious that people there have low income and if they know hotel is not responsible for anything why wouldnt they take something. Other than that, food was ok, beach was nice and whole grounds on property were nice. Best time was at at the beach bar with best bartender there named Armando. At our checkout they just handed us little yellow paper with room # on it and that was it. Nobody asked us bout our stay or anything and the lady from Guest service who we talked to about our problems for at least 45 minutes 2 day before and who was supposed to talk to us again was just walking by us like she never seen us before.

Price, location, and all inclusive. We hadn't been to Mexico in 5 years since the birth of our children. We have stayed at downtown hotels and the coastal all inclusives. This resort more than exceeded our expectations and criteria. First-Location- For all you experienced Playa Del Carmeners-The beach is back over 100ft from the resort to the ocean. It is a 15 minute walk downtown, on the sidewalk or beach, in the gated village of Playacar. For all of the naysayers,this is not a border town with drug violence. I read all the govt warnings and blogs and Playa Del Carmen is SAFE. My wife jogged downtown thru the village every morning-I slept in. Second-Price-When we booked our trip we paid around $109 a nite a person. There were a couple of competitors at the same price point but The Reef is the closest hotel to downtown. The room was very clean. We requested a second floor room because prior reviews claimed there was a bug problem. We never had any bug issues. Remember, the Riviera Maya is more of a jungle landscape, not a desert. A few bugs would not have been a shock.Our room had very good air conditioning and within minutes of check in, the room as fresh as any. We tipped the cleaning lady $10(a good courtesy by the way, they work hard and make very little) and our room was immaculate everyday with swan shaped towels on our bed. We experienced no pilferage or had even heard of any. We left cash out every day. The service was excellent everywhere we went on the resort. At the buffet, there was always a server to bring you a beverage. The bartenders at every bar were extremely attentive without gratuity-which of course made all of us tip them more. We were never asked once about a timeshare although we saw many tours. By the way, If you dont feel like simply saying no, tell them you won the trip and you're really poor. Third-All Inclusions- My wife is the tough customer at buffets and she couldnt have been happier, from the omelet station in the morning to the fajita station at nite, there was always something good to eat. Were you eating Filet and Lobster? No, but it was above and beyond prior buffets we have had. We though the two restaurants were great. Yes, the selection was a little limited, but heres the kicker-no reservations needed! Ever been to a resort and the day you check the half full restauarants are already booked? Not here. Dine inside or out. The food in these restaurants was excellent. To sum up the food, the wife and I were planning on eating downtown alot because we have our favorite restaurants and only ended up dining out once-and were disappointed. The drinks-never had any problem with my rum-Appleton Estate- or my beer-Dos Equis. What more do you want folks? Most people are drinking frozen drinks anyway. Who cares if its top shelf or not. There were at least 20 sun beds laidout between the beach and two pools and too many umbrellas to count. Yes, you had to be out early to stake your claim but such is the case at most resorts. There was never a shortage of lounges. Names such as Hector and Guillermo stick in my mind but there was truly not one unhelpful person.You almost tired of walking by a staff member saying \"Hola\". In summation folks, do your homework or blame your travel agent if your not satisfied. The old saying- Remember where your shopping. This place is smaller and much easier to get around. I truly want to thank all of the staff for a wonderful time!

We do not own a timeshare so we always end up coming back to The Reef because we want to, not because we have to. We sometimes stay at larger, more expensive hotels in Cancun for a few days, but still like The Reef best as our first choice. Everyone at The Reef is always so friendly and helpful that it really makes us feel like we are at home. The grounds are lush and beautiful, unlike the bigger hotels which are very open and cold. We first started coming to The Reef after the hurricane devasted Cancun in 2005. I was worried about staying at an all-inclusive, anticipating that there would be lines for food and drinks, and the quality would not be good. I was wrong and the food at The Reef is excellent with a huge variety of very good food. There are three sit down meals a day in the buffet and two restaurants for dinner. You can get something to eat or drink in many of the different bars, restaurants and snack shops almost 24 hours a day. The rooms are very comfortable and clean. I like the firm beds and can get a much better sleep on them rather than the soft beds at some resorts. All of the rooms are good but I especially like the upper floor rooms as they have a nice view from the balconies. The Reef is in a great location in North Playacar and it is an easy walk into the town of Playa Del Carmen. There are a lot of off-site activites in the area if you want to explore something else.The beach at The Reef was rebuilt a few years ago and is very large and flat. You can now easily walk the length of the beach from the end or into town. The Reef now has a premium bracelet option for $18/day. This may seem expensive at first but is worthwhile, as there is a renovated section of the beach that is open only to premium customers all day and all night, along with top shelf drinks. I continue to recommend it to my friends and family, and we plan to return again this summer or next winter.

Beautiful rain forest feel to the whole resort.All the workers were extremely nice and helpful. We were a bit disappointed with the buffet food. The breakfast and snack bar were pretty good. The two restaurants have decent food but very limited menu. Also some items on the menu there you have to pay for. Pool was kinda small and also being a young couple we missed some good music and maybe some fun games at the pool. Drinks were satisfactory but then again we don't drink heavily. Beach was beautiful...there was some sea weed washed up but was not too unsightly. Water was a beautiful turquoise color and the beach was clean and plenty big. Personally we were not bothered by any time share ppl. We sat down once with one person for about 20 mins ...10 mins of which she helped us understand what was around in the area. Just say no if not interested. Special mention to Mayaland tours with who we booked all our excursion. They were very helpful and spent a lot of time telling us what to expect on each excursion and gave us a decent discount for booking multiple excursions. As we did not stay on hotel premises too much we didn't mind the relative lack of activities and music...and mind you we were not looking for a crazy party just a little more life to the resort. Also def check out the tea spot in the middle of the resort which opens from 4-6, unfortunately the ice cream place was closed for our entire trip there. We went to one of the shows at the resort which was the Michael Jackson tribute and it was really good ..way above expectations. The rooms were serviceable...not great not bad. We were on the second floor right in the middle between the pool and the lobby. Overall I would give the resort 3 out of 5 stars. We paid about $2K with airfare for 6 nights which was a really good price imo. For that price i think it was a pretty good place to stay. You have to check out the 5th ave area...a bit commercialized but nice Miami feel to it. Felt safe the whole trip there and we went to multiple places so no worries there.

It is about a 20 minute walk to downtown. You can walk the beach or take the road. It is perfectly safe. We had no issues walking around. The grounds are wonderful. The resort is built around a small cave system and has lots of trees and vegetation. The rooms are decent. Nothing fantastic. Our bath tub was a set wrong and it leaked water on the floor. We used a towel to damn the water once we discovered the problem. The beds are firm to hard. The staff was very good overall. They work really hard for you and they work long days. The same guy at the pool bar at 11am would be pouring drinks at midnight upstairs. Now, our concerns. First, this is a time share resort. Upon arrival we were given a blue bracelet. Apparently, you can upgrade to premium alcohol and some other things or if you are part of the time share program you automatically upgrade to a silver or gold bracelet. The problem is that blue band makes you a target on and off the resort for time share sellers. On two occasions the concierge tried to set us up with a time share meeting. Not my idea of a concierge. And on one occasion we were approached downtown. The guy downtown, said \"hey, I see you have blue band\"..... The food isn't great. 3 of the nights had decent choices. The other nights we had a little trouble finding something. The non buffet restraunts have 5 or so free choices and 4 up charge choices. The free choices were not that great. The presentation was good, but the taste and satisfaction were lacking. We ate at each only once. Breakfast was good. They have an egg and omelette station that is made to order. The drinks are weak. If you tip a little the drinks get stronger. I had Kaluha. Before the tip my glass had maybe a shot glass full of Kaluha. After 20 pesos, Kaluha filled half my glass. They have about 12 beach cabana beds and 12 or so umbrellas. If you want a cabana you need to claim one by 6:30 am. If you want an umbrella you need to claim one by 7:30 am. Otherwise your in the sun on beach chair if you can find one. The rooms are setup in individual 3 story units. Each floor has 4 rooms accesses from the outside. It is all stairways, no elevators. So if stairs are a concern for you, request a ground floor room. Overall, the resort is average, 3 star.

The beach was a 2 minute walk from our room, the restaurants were a 2 minute walk, the lobby and bars were a 2 minute walk...perfect!

A lot of the bartenders and waiters float around between the bars, so you would see them in different positions during the week - they were all really great.

Exactly what we were looking for\u201d", "Author": "jetsetter_xoxo", "ReviewID": "UR125629280", "Content": "We were a young couple going out to enjoy the beach and stay at decent hotel at a nice resort and that's what we got. We loved it! Here's a rundown of what we experienced: LOCATION This hotel was right off one of the most beautiful beaches. For that reason alone, I could give it 5 stars... From the photos, I didn't expect the fanciest rooms and/or amenities... but I came here for the beach. I'm not trying to get stuck inside a hotel. I think having a decent room was my main goal, along with a decent hotel and decent food... and of course, good customer service... and that's what Reef Playacar had. CUSTOMER SERVICE The customer service was pretty good. I expect a lot from people in Customer Service and I can honestly say that I was happy with how the people treated you at this resort. Kudos to them all. We tipped well because of such a great attitude and professionalism from everyone. Hector, at the front desk, was very cool/awesome. He helped us find some good restaurants where the locals eat (which we asked for) and the waiters were mostly pretty smiley and attentive. Most people would remember you. They were good at that. HOTEL DESIGN The hotel design is great! It looks beautiful... more beautiful than it appears in pictures, and we were already happy with the pictures that we had seen online... It has a great beachfront, beautiful canopy beds on the sand, bright blue umbrellas, beautiful pools, a swim up bar, etc. They also had this cool/awesome tree in the center that had all of these lights/lanterns hanging up from it. We loved the coziness of the hotel. It was exactly the feel that we were looking for. Inside, the hotel room was decent... nothing too fancy, but we did book a superior room, which gave us access to a safe, robes, and a stocked fridge, which we could use for free, and which they re-stocked daily. FOOD The food was... alright... But we figured this coming in, having had such a great package (hotel/air/food). Most days, we ate at the buffet, which would have good food some days, ok food other days.... But they also had a snack bar, which had pizzas, tacos, nachos, etc. that were really good if you couldn't deal with the buffet, so this place is good if you're okay with food like this. Plus, the snack bar would be open until 2 a.m., so if you were ever up late and still a bit hungry... you could easily go there. Aside from the buffet and the snack bar, we tried one restaurant that came with our all-inclusive package, and that restaurant was called Terraza Grill... We did not like it all. The food just did not have good flavor. I don't know how else to describe it except to say that I felt like the foods people make at home taste better, so... I wouldn't recommend their \"fancy\" restaurants... Just the buffet or the snack bar. AREA This hotel resort is located in Playacar, a gated community within Playa del Carmen, and it is so uber safe and pleasant. We could literally walk on the street to their downtown area at the latest hours and feel extremely safe. Sometimes, I would even take out my camera to take pictures, and still... nothing. Very nice area. MAINTENANCE The maids were great. We'd come back to a well-kept room. We thought they did a great job! WI-FI Wi-Fi cost an additional $37.00 or so for a week (and less for however many days you decide to purchase it)... and you could only use it in the lobby... but I rationalized that for 7 days, that's about $5.00/day... and having it in the lobby kept me from staying indoors all day when... hey I can do that any day... Let's go out to the beach! **Anyways, I guess to say that, if you are looking for a reasonably priced hotel on a great beach that has a decent room and pretty good food... go here! We loved it.

The WI-FI internet access is hit and miss. They want $10 a day, which is a total rip off and then it doesn't work half the time, especially in the morning when the hotel workers are using it. One more thing for the managers of The Reef, if you happen to read these reviews and I know you do. You need to communicate better with your guests. Put up larger signs in multiple locations to advertise any events taking place at your hotel. You have a small sign in the lobby, but I think that is inadequate and not updated very well. One night you closed all of the restaurants and the buffet and moved all of the food up to the bar above the lobby and I think very few people in the place knew what was happening until they found the restaurants dark and abandoned.

As much as we love it, this year was a bit different we are assuming due to the new ownership that took place 7 months ago. Our check in was not as smooth as last year. This time the desk personnel seemed a bit clueless. They did not offer a room safe, we had to ask for it. There was a phone message in our room on the second day and they were no help getting it resolved. The message was not in english. After finally forcing someone to come to the room to listen to it, turns out it was an emergency call that hit the wrong room extension. This took some time to resolve. The food is good, the workers are all quite friendly and house keeping did a great job with our room again. There are very few thing to complain about when it comes to the Reef. They created a VIP section where you can pay an extra $18.00 per day to enjoy higher end drinks but there were very few people in it. I feel they did nothing but absorbe quality beach space. Last year it was used as an extension of the beach. This would have better served as the place to hold all the pain in the neck wedding we had to endure. There were a total of 4 weddings in the 9 days were were there. Everyone loves a wedding but the rest of the resort guest should not have to be inconvenienced for them. For one wedding, the workers literally came to the beach and moved people with their chairs, towels, umbrellas and belongings and moved them off to the side because \"the bride wanted a clear view of the beach and water\". Really?? There was almost a riot on the beach. Some people compained to the front desk, but they just shook their heads like they cared, but you know they did not.

We found the resort through Tippr, one of those deal sites and for the both of us for 6 nights, it was $1100. You could not beat the price. After an incident in our intial room (they provided us a room with no sink!), they moved us the next day to a different room that was much bigger and made us very happy! Overall, we had a wonderful relaxing week. The resort is not luxurious - but that is not what we were looking for. The grounds, set in a jungle theme, give the resort a character on its own. The food was great - we ate breakfast and lunch at the buffets, dinner twice at the two on site restaurants and two other nights in Playa del Carmen. On Valentine's Day, my boyfriend and I had a romantic lobster dinner on the beach, which was beautiful, with a saxophone player. The whole beach was set up beatifully and it really made our trip. The best thing we can say about the resort is the SERVICE. The service was great and friendly and everyone there really made you feel so welcome. A lot of the reviews complain about the time share people and while we did see them everywhere, they did not bother us once. I will say though that I wish the hot tub was accessible to the rest of the guests. It was in the \"VIP Lounge\", which was only accessible to the people who paid $18 per day for premium drinking. In my opinion, it really wasn't worth paying the extra money because the drinks were just fine with what they were serving. I would have, however, liked to have been able to use the hot tub. But, that is a minor complaint. If you are looking for a 5 star, luxury resort with tons of amenities then the Reef is not the place. But, if you are looking for a quiet, romantic, relaxing week with your boyfriend or girlfriend and you just want to eat, drink, relax on the beach or the pool, then this is the perfect place!

It's a 4 star in top form. If you want booze in your minifridge all the time, an umbrella in your room, a really big standard room, specialty coffee included, go find a five-star. If you want a big hot tub, go somewhere else. Theirs was small and empty, likely for cleaning or something. It didn't look gross or anything, just empty. Our room size was fine, big enough to put down an additional blow-up bed for one of my 2 sons, but not much more. The bathroom was clean and everything worked well. Love that clothesline in the tub! Air conditioning worked and is thoroughly modern (has remote), but I didn't use it much, preferred the overhead fan. Nice little balcony. Our room faced the outside, and that was nice and quiet. There was a lawn and shrubbery that hid the parking lot next door. Inside lower rooms mean you get to do lots of people-watching on your porch. The food is excellent and you can go to one of the two a la carte restaurants any day you like. WOW, they are really nice! The Italian is a little more formal, and there is friendly competition between the two restaurants (they are next to each other). The buffet is perfectly fine too. It's amazing what these people have done with a small space. This place is on various levels and terraces and that sort of thing, and spaces are hidden from one another, making it intimate and interesting. I love the waterfalls and this beautiful relaxing central patio-thing that you can relax on and have treats/drinks at 4pm daily. There are many agoutis - we got to see a mama agouti nursing her baby. I wouldn't say the foliage is truly natural as it is mostly philodendrons on the ground (and trees) but it is rich and plentiful. The beach is lovely and big. It is very cool that we could easily walk down the beach to Playa del Carmen. Snorkeling was fine but way too busy, lots of people and groups. Sadly, the underwater flora has paid the price of all that use and is dying off in spots. The resort has two pools, both of which are nice. I liked the lobby bar where we bought specialty coffee in the morning. They have merchants in on a couple of evenings (the jeweller is charging WAY too much) but it is pretty and fun to look. I felt comfortable with the clientele here - there aren't the pretentious types who seem to need to act rich and snobby. People here were very pleasant and friendly. Lots of families with babies and very small kids, but it never seemed to be a problem. My sons (12 and 14) liked it, especially the ice cream and beach. This IS NOT a place for the type who wants to party hearty. It is too small and peaceful. A bunch of young men showed up right before we left and they stuck out like sore thumbs with their own boom box and taking over the bar. This is too small of a place to accommodate that kind of behaviour. I hope security was able to handle it. What security I saw were pleasant and diligent. All the staff were pleasant. I almost don't want to make such a good review because then everyone will go here and I don't want this place to get any bigger than it is or more commercial.

As with most places there were good and not so good points. First staff, mostly great with some real good ones tossed in: Jhonathan, Saul, Victor, Jose for example go the extra to actually get to know you. I am sure there were others but once we met these guys - we tended to seek them out. Check in: We arrived before our room was available, decided to get a snack at the buffet and a cocktail. We put bags in storage so as not to have to drag them around. The lobby 'condo sharks' were present at check in, and the concierge came right over to 'help' us. We blew her off and headed out of the lobby and thru out the trip we would walk briskly past them or alone. We never were bothered after that first encounter and we had a few cocktails in the lobby bar. So they are there and if you allow them to divert you from your vacation - they will. Just say No, gracias and keep moving. No calls or anything ever came so no harm no foul. One item on check in that seems to be prevalent is the computer systems. Not sure if this is a real problem or operator error. Getting a printed bill seems to be a problem. Our room: we tried for a higher end but got a king room with superior extras. The place was pretty busy and our friends did get the top floor double decks with hot tub. We visited and the room (1032) seem a little more cramped than ours (923). We had a small view of the beach/water and very large view of pool area. The room is a great spot for people watching as this sits right off the main route back to front. A little noisy with the workers and carts heading down the path to the spa area but not horrible. Back to our room. we sat on the deck for a good amount of time and noticed a huge amount of insects (ants running around) and then I noticed termite tubes on the main wooded post. These were active tubes and breaking them will show this. The post is in pretty bad shape, maybe why the units across the path are going changed to metal and glass? Beware do not lean up against these wooden rails you may take a dive. 923 also has seen some issue possibly from the tube on the third floor, the ceiling has been repaired and water damage on the wall is evident. Also if your getting a room opt for closer to the pool. The further up the path to the lobby you go the breeze cuts off and the apparent heat rises dramatically due to the jungle like plants. Beds: Yup they are a little hard - inspecting ours - looked like the pillow top was place down on the frame vs up. We left it was not a major show stopper for sleep. A small word of caution for those with young children - would be best to keep them on the paths and watch were you are walking. One day I came out of my room to see a staff member looking at something on the steps. Turned out to be a 2 ft Green Tree snake of sorts. For a smallish snake it had a big attitude, held its ground and was pretty aggressive. Mildly poisonous apparently. A little girl oblivious and not able to understand my english words of warning missed getting bit by inches. Also there are some ants around there that a big on bit as well. Remember this is a jungle like setting and there is wildlife around. Rumors of a boa on site were also heard. I am sure this is not an isolated event. It is the tropics and the Yucatan. We did purchase the extra bling (upgraded from blue band to gold) which gets you a little more. We thought it was worth it and it was short money. Food: The buffet gets a bit tired after a while. Breakfast was pretty decent wide array of choices. The upstairs grills were fair nothing special. The snack bar also was pretty decent. Just go easy on the cheese for the pizza and nachos...they tend to put on way too much IMHO. Downtown: is a short walk away. We walked it once then when going in the evening we opted for a cab. Try De Casa Del Aqua. Very good. The scene is crazy when the ship are in Cozumel. Go later in the afternoon. Beaches: I can not remember being on vacations and seeing a beach that was littered to this extent and with such a variety of trash. The PlayaCar resots should get this under control soon before it gets worse. It was not only our hotel but pretty much the entire beach. Some is from onshore activities (for example the weddings at our hotel) and a lot is being blown on shore with the tides/wind. Wear foot gear or watch your step - several people in the hotel got medical attention (iodine and band aid from the towel hut) after stepping on something. The water is pretty clean and was very pretty with the variety of colors. Bars: We went once to the upstairs bar above the lobby, it was not too late nor too early. We looks for a place for the four of us to sit and gave up as no seating was to be had. We had the extra bling so we would just go to our bling bar and always got a seat. At times we were the only ones there! The music, breeze, view and the attention was fantastic. Worth the money per day adder. Pool bar was ok, seats there are very uncomfortable. Lobby bar was good for people watching. One thing that seems to be a problem is stocking the bars. More times than not the bartender would be short of glasses, ice, mixers or did not have the choice liquor and we would move to a different place. Not a big deal but a stocked bar should be set up before opening to limit the bartenders need to run all over the facility. Summing it up: Nice place. Some negatives.

I have been to several AI's in Mexico, I never expect stellar food, but this was bad. I generally choose to go to town for dinner, when I stay at an AI because I like to experience the wonderful restaurants in a given area. In this case it wasn't a choice. In summary, I would recommend this resort, but don't expect too much, you'll be disappointed. It's a budget resort with a nice beach and great price. I was not unhappy that we chose it.

My husband was unable to get the time off from work, so he had to stay back in wintery Wisconsin while I caught some rays at Reef Playacar. First of all, if you're in your early to mid-20s and you're looking for a mega resort with eight restaurants and five pools, this is not your resort. If you're looking for a fist-pumping \"Jersey Shore\" party atmosphere, this is not your resort. If you're looking for four-star dining, this is not your resort. But if you're looking for a good deal (while airfare is through the roof) and you just want somewhere to chill by the pool or on the pristine beach while you sip on foo-foo drinks, this is your resort. The GOOD: This is the fifth time I've been to Mexico (once to Cancun, twice to Puerto Vallarta, once to Cozumel) and there is no doubt that this is a small, budget resort. Prices aren't what they used to be. It's difficult to find a decent hotel/air all-inclusive in Mexico for under $1,000 per person for one week. When we booked our trip (in October) the cost was $1,300 for one week, or $1,800 for two weeks (per person). We booked the two weeks because it made more sense. We learned while talked to other people at the resort that many were staying for two weeks because of the fantastic price. That said, you get what you pay for. People who are complaining that the rooms are outdated should consider the cost of this resort and compare apples to apples. The rooms may be a bit outdated (think Best Western compared with The Hilton) but they are extremely clean and a good size, even for three adults. I can't say enough good about the staff. These people work nearly 12 hours every day of the week. Every day. If I had to work 12 hours a day, seven days a week, I would be snippy and crabby and just a royal pain, but not these workers! I saw Humberto (pool bar bartender) deal with rude Americans (I am an American) and Canadians by being polite and smiling. And when he wasn't running his butt off making every blended drink under the sun, he was cleaning his work area or running around the pool collecting glasses. And it wasn't just Humberto ... nearly every worker I encountered was just as hard-working and friendly. Best service I've received anywhere, including my Midwestern hometown. For the most part the breakfast buffet is delicious. There was one day where the hash browns were lukewarm, or as my dad joked, \"Just the right amount of cold.\" But overall, the omelet station was great and there is definitely enough to choose from. Put your toast in the toaster before you get in line for your omelete and it will be ready for you when you return. I was really impressed that you didn't have to pay more for the cabanas (like other resorts do) and that they were fairly easy to get. Typically we were early risers and were able to pick out chairs by 7 a.m. but on our last day we waited until 8:30 a.m. and still were able to get a cabana. Very nice. Manuel, at the ceramics stand, saw way too much of my family. We probably kept him in business the whole two weeks we were there. Manuel has ceramic figures that you paint yourself and then he puts finishing touches on them and glazes them overnight. You get them back the next day. Manuel is so talented, and we had tons of fun with him. Prices range from $15-$25. They make great gifts. The beach was wonderful! For someone who doesn't get to see the ocean on a normal basis, this is one of my favorite things to do. We walked down the beach and dug up sea shells. We swam in the water. My parents rented jet skis. There are no rocks on the beach, and although seaweed might make its way onto the beach because of wind, it didn't change my opinion of the wonderful beach and sand. The BAD: Although I did go down to the beach almost every day to hang out for a while, the pool is really my stomping grounds. The two pools were very clean, and I saw a worker checking the chlorine levels every day, but the second day I was there I cut my big toe on the bottom of the pool and it hurt for a good part of the trip. A few days later I cut the ball of my foot on the bottom of the pool. It's not an isolated incident and those tiles should be fixed asap. The pools are not very big, although that didn't bother me as much as not having a designated pool for the children. I love kids, but I wanted to be a little more relaxed on my vacation. Two times my mom and I were lounging in the pool (the swim-up bar pool and the other) and kids playing tag were almost running into us because they were so close. Not a big deal, but not really relaxing either. Many people have complained about the hardness of the beds. I didn't have a problem. My parents also slept fine. I don't like really soft beds though, so maybe it's a personal comfort thing. The lobby bar is a cash bar and it opens at 3 p.m. That's just silly. If you want a free drink you have to go either upstairs outside the dinner theater or to the swim-up bar. Again, silly. This bar should be open from noon until midnight and it should be free. The \"Premier\" bar, where you can choose to pay $18 a day to drink top-shelf liquor, is also silly. No one was in the premier bar, and really it's just a waste of space. Take that out, put the kiddie pool/play area down there and call it a day. The UGLY: I feel bad for this resort because it can't do a darn thing about people who drink 15 too many drinks and then stumble back to their rooms while screaming \"YEE HAW\" throughout the entire complex. Around 3 a.m. every morning we'd hear the drunks stumbling home. The \"YEE HAW\" lady sticks out in my mind. Every two minutes she would scream it while walking back. Dad heard commotion one night and saw a girl bend over on the walkway, and then dive head first into the concrete. The First Aid worker helped her out. It was kind of the entertainment for the night. I didn't mind it too much because I'm a good sleeper, but a light sleeper might have more to say. Dinner at the buffet was horrible. I wouldn't say this if it weren't true. I'm not a picky eater, and I can always find something worth eating on a buffet. I've been to plenty of AI resorts and never has the food been this terrible. :( I truly believe it wouldn't take much to make it good -- make sure the food is hot while it's being served, add spices, etc. But those easy fixes were never made. We started going to town every night for dinner, which was fun but very spendy! Playa has it figured out ... tourists = lots of dinero. We never had a dinner that was under $70, and all but one was over $100 (with drinks). If the food at the resort was better, people would feel like they're getting a better deal. Asking for things from the front desk is a waste of time. That's not to say that the front desk people are lazy or rude. In fact, they were very nice! But they're really not interested in helping out with amenities. Since we had three adults in one room, we needed three towels instead of two. It took three days until we started getting three towels instead of just two. We also wanted extra hangers and an extra chair for our third-floor balcony. And about half way through the trip the blow dryer in the bathroom stopped working. Mom made several requests for these things and accommodations never were made. Finally, while exchanging money mom asked if we ever were going to get what we asked for (chair/hangers/blow dryer) because if not, she would stop asking. He said no, and she stopped asking. Good thing I brought my blow dryer. I do have a few things to say about the timeshare people. We never were bothered because both my mom and I have traveled so much that we can spot a timeshare person a mile away. Timeshares are the biggest waste of money. They are a horrible investment. Don't believe me? Put your faith in Clark Howard: http://www.clarkhoward.com/news/clark-howard/scams-rip-offs/major-hoteliers-getting-out-of-the-time-share-busi/nDqN/ Now, if you read that and you still want to waste four hours of your hard-earned vacation on timeshare people so you can get a free appetizer at Coco Bongo, then go right ahead, but don't complain to us about it. And don't assume that because you said \"no\" 47 times to the timeshare sellers and they got snippy with you, that all the workers at The Reef are jerks. If you haven't stayed at the resort, you hardly are qualified to write a review on it. I've said my peace. OVERALL: I think this is a nice, budget resort with a great beach and fantastic staff.

We are all in our 20s-30s and were looking for a fun and relaxing vacation. We chose this resort from a few I had investigated via TripAdvisor and thought it would be acceptable based on other user reviews. And it was OK, but we all agreed that it was not anywhere we would return in the future. The drawbacks of the resort: Limited restaurants available on the premises and on one of the nights we were there all the restaurants were closed and ALL resort guests had to eat in the theater room and watch a mexican performance and eat from a Mexican buffet. This was a surprise to us and not a pleasant one. Additionally, the nicer restaurants (Italian and Steak) barely had the tables to accommodate a group of 6 each evening and would accept reservations for us. And finally, particularly at the italian place, you could order the same dish 2 nights in a row and receive COMPLETELY different dishes. This was very odd and offputting because if you liked something from a previous dining experience, you could not be sure you were going to get that again. Another drawback was that there was really nothing to do in the evenings. The outdoor \"sports bar\" in the upper level did not have any TVs for actually watching sports and the pool table was in very rough shape. The shows each night were not really our scene and there was no real entertainment nearby for us to explore. Additionally, the lobby bar was very small (6 seats maybe?) and the bartender was quite rude. For example, one of the evenings we were the only group in the bar and we asked him to please turn on the Brewers playoff baseball game and he first refused, but then after some negotiating (in spanish, thankfully a member of our group is fluent), he gruffly put the game on. And finally, the lobby and sports bar only served certain drinks and did not have any red wine available ever. Apparently you can only get red wine in the restaurants. And finally, our room was in need of a deep cleaning and some redecorating. The coverlet blanket had an odd bleach spot on it; the bottom of the lampshades were burnt (I will try to add a picture of this); the bathroom grout was very dirty and the bottom of our bathtub was dirty and cracked. We probably should have asked for a new room, but since we didn't plan on spending much time in the room, we didn't bother. The bright spots: I think there were 2 highlights to this hotel; the afternoon tea/coffee service and the ability to walk up the beach into Playa del Carmen. The afternoon tea service was as wonderful as all other reviews have mentioned. Unfortunately it rained our first few days on the trip and so the tea area was too wet to use, so we didn't get to have tea each day. But we definitely made a point to go each time we saw it was open. The bartender was wonderful and you got to have premium liquors in your coffee without a fee. The little cookies and sandwiches were tasty too. And, it was just a very beautiful atmosphere to be sitting under the trees enjoying a little treat. And finally, it was nice to be able to take a 30 minute walk up the beach to get into Playa. While we only did this once, it was a nice way to spend half a day. And it certainly beat having to pay for a cab. In summary, this resort was fine, but certainly nothing spectacular. Next time I travel to the Riviera Maya I will spend a little more money and get many more amenities at a larger resort. Reef Playacar was just too small and not maintained well enough for my travel taste.

The wifi is only in the lobby and is 10usd a day. So, if you decide to use it, you are stuck with the timeshare idiots who will not leave you alone. This is not cool!! The food is not very good. The two resaurants that are included only have two or three options that are not extra charges. I paid 17usd extra for a steak that was terrible.

The check in was speedy and soon we were all in our rooms with time to find the buffet and get some delicous food. Then off to Papa's Bar where we met Eric the bartender, what a wonderful person he is.His attendance to us was over whelming and alway knew just what we wanted and when. Jesus on the bar behind the snackbar has a wonderful way about him as well. After only speaking with him once and after a hour later as we walked up to the bar and our glasses were already waiting for us. The rest of the staff is just as charming Roxanne with her lovely smile every morning and afternoon made you want to come to the buffet for every meal. Mary was also very attentive. The rooms are spotless as are the grounds. Every day they are out working to make The Reef the best. The pools are cool but with the heat your looking to be cooled down. As you walk through the grounds you really feel like your in the jungle. We went to the Italian resturant for dinner one night it;s ok but we enjoyed the Mexican resturant the following evening the best of the two. The food at the buffet is plentiful with a lot of choices so no one would get tired of your choices. We also had the honor of watching a young couple from Edmonton get married on the beach. It was done in Mayan style and it was so beautiful to watch and we wish the bride and groom all the best. All in all when it came time to leave we all wanted to stay another week and will definitely be back in the near future.

This is an all-inclusive resort which has amazing service (thanks Franklin!). Don't forget to bring some money to tip these people as they do a great job! We tried one of the restaurants however the buffet is really the place to be for all your meals as they have a wide selection of food (however the amount of Mexican food selections are surprisingly low). There is also a snack stand open till 2am which makes awesome club sandwiches, fries and tacos. There are multiple bars around for drinks and they have a hidden icecream stand and 'tea and tequila' area which are nice. There is a VIP area that you can get into for an additional $18 with premium liquor and a jacuzzi. If you are going in to drink, its worth it to pay the extra amount as the drinks are surprisingly a noticeable upgrade (though the regular drinks are fine to begin with). The beach has soft sand but beware of some jagged shells. The water is warm-cool and clear. There are people that will walk around the beach to sell cigars, pictures with an animal or day trips but they aren't overly bothersome. The day trips that they sell on the beach are actually incredibly worth it, as we went on 2 all-day all-inclusive excursions for $65 each which includes transportation, lunch, and admission to places like Chichen Itza, and activities like snorkeling. This was a very relaxing place to come. (We did get a phone call on the first or second day asking us to come to the front desk, but once we got there we found out it was for a timeshare presentation. Simply say 'no' to the things like timeshare presentation or if someone is trying to sell you something, and they will leave you alone) Each room comes with a balcony which we used several times, but really, you won't be inside your room much. The city is a 15 minute walk away. For those traveling from abroad, USD is fine to use as currency 99% of the time (expect to pay around $30 in fees if you still wanted to switch to pesos).

The room and bathroom were spacious, spotless, and nicely decorated. The bed was firm, but we found it very comfortable, especially after requesting and receiving a foam mattress pad from housekeeping. The private balcony was surrounded by trees and overlooked the sitting area where they serve coffee in the evening. The grounds of the hotel are incredible! Beautiful vegetation, real waterfalls, agoutis and coatis galore. At night, there are lanterns hung from the trees that give a romantic and unique glow. You really do feel like you're in a secluded jungle paradise. We were amazed at the beauty of the place (and we honeymooned in the jungle of Costa Rica, so we've seen good stuff!). The beach is expansive with that powdery white sand that you come to the Caribbean for. We had no trouble getting lounge chairs on the beach, and we usually came down around 8:00 am. The beds at the beach/pool area are a wonderful touch, too. The water is not perfectly calm, but it is that gorgeous blue-green shade, warm, and lovely for a swim. We took the kayaks out a couple of times, and had fun paddling up and down the beach. The food is perhaps the only part we weren't wild about. I'm glad we were only there for four days, as we probably would have tired of the food had we stayed much longer. We did like the buffet; there were plenty of choices, and we were rarely disappointed. My husband was not a fan at all of either of the specialty restaurants. I liked the Italian place better than the Mexican, perhaps because my salmon dish at the Mexican restaurant was still raw in the middle when I got it. It is true that for some dishes in the specialty restaurants you have to pay extra. The ice cream parlor is a fun stop in the day, and I loved their coconut ice cream! Playa Del Carmen is a 15 minute walk either down the beach or the road, and it's safe to walk even at night. A tip for getting from the airport to the Reef: Take the ADO bus! It's inexpensive ($10 USD per person one way), very modern and comfortable, and a nonstop trip from the airport to the Playa Del Carmen 5th Avenue bus station. Just find the ADO counter at the Ground Transportation area in the airport and order your tickets from there. There are plenty of cabs waiting at the bus station in Playa, and a cab ride to the Reef will cost about $7 USD. All in all, this is a fantastic place to stay, especially if you aren't interested in one of those huge mazes of resorts. It's unique, charming, well-kept, and more.

The setting is perfect, surrounded by trees, cenotes and little animals called agouti all over the place. This resort is great if you are looking for a very quiet holiday without too much activity. Never saw anything going on around or in the pool. Did hear an announcement for beach volleyball but that was all I saw. We didn't even dip our toes in the pool since the beach was so amazing. We did request to switch rooms to a king bed which as another reviewer wrote, is not a problem. Our room was second floor and faced the garden and cenote. ||Amazing. The negatives I would say would be the lack of spunk at this resort. Would be a nice touch to have some mariache playing at dinner or anywhere for that matter. Barely heard any music at all. I think travellers appreciate latin music. The shows we saw were kinda cheesy and unfortuanately we arrived and left the day of the folklore mexican show so we missed it all together. Heard this is worth watching and they bring in professional dancers for this one. I must say the staff do try to make it the best they can but it is the same group of entertainment staff that work all day and do the shows at night so I think they are overworked. We were very satisfied with both the grill and italian restaurant. Not too much selection if you stay with what is included but very delicious. There is an ice cream parlour which is quite yummy, small cones but you can go back as much as you want. Between 4 and 6 they set up tables at the seating area beside the cenote and make coffee with alcohol. Its quite a show with the fire and spoons. They offer sandwiches and cookies at the same time. The snack bar and beach bar are amazing and so is Jesus. He is so great. My husband would go back after dinner to the snack bar to get tacos since they are only served after 6. The pizza was just ok but the fries were out of this world declicious. Buffet did get a bit repetitive but always found something good to eat. For trips we took the ado bus and went back to cancun and took ferry to isla mujeres. Rented golf cart and explored. It was amazing. Cozumel did not appeal to us too much and glad we didnt go since we heard from others that went that it is a bit of a tourist trap since all the cruiseships dock there. All in all, I would go back if the price was right (did see if drop into the $600 range after we booked) but would prefer a resort with a bit more activity escecially if we were to bring the kids. We did thoroughly enjoy ourselves though and the beauty of the resort is better than any 5 star we have stayed at.", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal", "Title": "\u201cA dream come true!!\u201d", "Author": "Zenwilson", "ReviewID": "UR121849079", "Content": "Just back from a week in paradise!! We stayed at the Reef from November 24th to December 1st and found this resort to be an absolute \u201cdream come true\u201d!! As our original trip date had to be postponed, I had lots of time to research resorts on-line and I kept coming back to The Reef Playacar. It\u2019s price point and close proximity to Playa Del Carmen (5th Ave.) offered us everything we wanted and more. I\u2019ll try to be as concise as possible although I could go on for ever about this hidden gem!! GENERAL INFO: The Reef is a small, beautiful boutique resort (18 buildings, 202 rooms), located in the gated community of Playacar. No vans or taxies get into this area without first having to go through a check-point to leave their I.D. Certainly gives you a very \u201csecure\u201d feeling. We chose to use USA Transfer for private transport to the resort and it took us 45 minutes from the airport to the check-in desk. I was told my other travelers that it took them almost 2 \u00bd hours to get there using the big bus provided my the carrier (this time would vary depending on how many resorts it stops at on the way to The Reef). After a seamless check-in the porter took us through sliding doors which open onto the most beautiful grounds with winding paths through the a lush rain forest, passing the \u201ccenote-caf\u00e9\u201d and waterfalls to our rooms. The property itself is set up in sort of an oval with the main lobby at one end, the pools, restaurants & beach at the other and the buildings (rooms) in between. Everything is within easy walking distance, NO golf carts or trolley\u2019s required!!! Everywhere you look there are staff members tending to the grounds. They take great pride is making sure that all the paths are swept and raked. ROOMS: We were on the third floor and although there are no elevators it\u2019s an easy walk up. The rooms are lovely, simple, nothing fancy. Two double beds, a dresser a table and chairs and a t.v. The bathroom was large and keep spotlessly clean! I loved finding a cloth line on the wall in the bathroom as well as an ironing board and iron in the closet!! The beds were very comfortable although a bit on the hard side. If this is a problem for you, just call down to the front desk and they will be happy to send up a mattress topper for you. The room was cleaned daily and mini-fridge topped up with soft drinks and water. We had a beautiful balcony overlooking the cenote-cafe. Great place to just sit and contemplate the beauty around you!! POOLS AND BEACH: The two pools and the grounds around them were immaculately clean. The pool bar was a hoot to hang around at, make sure to ask the bartender to make you a \u201cMiami Vice\u201d!! The \u201ctowel-game\u201d was a non-issue and we never had any difficulty finding either a chair or a palapa. The beach is sandy, no rock issues and no water shoes required to get to or in the water. Great for swimming! No lifeguard so keep an eye on the flag for conditions. RESTAURANTS: We loved the food and the variety!! Carolina at the buffet is absolutely lovely, always a smile and ready with helpful advice. Never had the same thing twice and everything was delicious. As a \u201cbirthday treat\u201d we booked at the Terraza Grill and the meal was fantastic as was the staff who really went out of their way to make it a fun evening! An extra perk that I enjoyed is that for those of us who are early-risers (to catch the sunrise) they always had tea, coffee and pastries set up outside the buffet between 5:30 & 6:00 a.m. It was VERY appreciated!! BARS: Although they were all lovely and the service was great, my favorite was La Chiquita. Special shout out to Carlos, he\u2019s absolutely fantastic. Always a smile and a cheery \u201cOla\u201d. He\u2019d see me coming and by the time I got there, my drink was ready!! THINGS TO DO ON-SITE: Make sure to stop at the ice-cream bar. Their flavors are out of this world and it\u2019s lovely to just sit and enjoy the waterfalls. -Don\u2019t miss going to the \u201cCenote-Caf\u00e9\u201d between 4 and 6. They make the most amazing flamb\u00e9 Mayan coffee!! They also serve lovely pastry\u2019s and sandwiches. A lovely way to unwind before heading out to dinner. -Take advantage of the \u201cfree intro to Scuba\u201d in the pool. A great way to see if it\u2019s something you\u2019re interested in. Tony was incredibly patient with those of us who were a little apprehensive. Very thorough in his teaching and by the end of the hour, we were ready to sign up for a day trip! It was great!!! -If you have an overcast day, spending time with Manuel at the \u201cpottery kiosk\u201d is an absolute must!! Making your own \u201cMexican Souvenir\u201d is the way to go, and it\u2019s not just for the kids!!! You pick what kind of item you want (mask, fish, plate, bowl), paint it and then, when you think you\u2019ve created an absolute work of art, Manuel takes it away, \u201cfixes it up\u201d, glazes and fires it and then brings it back the next day. It\u2019s not as easy as it sounds\u2026after a few margaritas\u2026it\u2019s hard to paint inside the lines!!! Manuel is a lovely gentleman and has the patience of a saint with those of us who thought we were the next Picasso!! -If you forget to pack some reading material, there\u2019s a little kiosk set up right by the first level pool which houses a little library of books you can borrow for the duration of your stay. Vey convenient! -3 or 4 nights during our stay there was a little \u201cmarket\u201d set up with various vendors coming on site to sell their wares. Very convenient, especially if you\u2019ve forgotten to buy someone a souvenir!!! STAFF: What can I say, they were all great! From the check-in staff to the ground keepers, always smiling, courteous and helpful. OFF-SITE: Take advantage of your proximity to 5th ave. It\u2019s an amazing, vibrant place to walk around, shop and just people watch!! Fabulous restaurants, bars and shops. A 15 minute walk or 5 minute taxi ride (aprox. $7.00) from the Reef. -Excursions: Chichen Itza and snorkeling at Dos Ojos Cenote with Edventure Tours (the review will be us soon on their site) Amazing!!! TIMESHARE: Although we saw them walking around, not one member of our group was approached. In summary, we absolutely loved The Reef. The price point, the location, the staff and the resort itself made our Mexican vacation a dream come true. We\u2019re already planning our next trip in January of 2013 and The Reef Playacar is our destination!", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, AB", "Title": "\u201cWedding 2011\u201d", "Author": "Nikki_and_Ben1985", "ReviewID": "UR121804885", "Content": "After reviewing every hotel in the Mayan Riviera, my fiance and I decided on The Reef Playacar as the resort we wanted to get married at. We arrived on November 19th (stayed for two weeks), and had a group of almost 50 people staying with us at the same resort, some staying for one week and some staying for two. When we arrived at our hotel, it was a very quick check-in for everyone that was in our group. This is the third resort that I have stayed at in Playacar, the other two being Viva Wyndham Maya, and the Allegro Playacar. The grounds are absolutely gorgeous, very lush, like a jungle, the best grounds of the three hotels I have stayed at. And it is extremely close to Playa Del Carmen (5th Ave) if you want to go shopping. Basically a 3 or 4 minute cab ride or a 15-20 minute walk down the beach. The food in the buffet was just okay to us, but alot of our group loved the food.. we loved the egg station for breakfast, and the pasta station for lunch or dinner. The fruit was not the best here, I found that it never seemed ripe enough. The snack bar was usually a hit or miss, but usually a hit.. We ate there the majority of the time because we loved the french fries and the hot dogs and hamburgers. We also ate at the Italian restaurant a couple of times. You didn't have to make reservations for it, which was amazing! It was delicious and had great service, but some nights it was extremely noisy and it felt like you were screaming to talk to the person beside you. Most of the staff were very friendly. We never had a problem with anyone at the front desk, they were always extremely helpful and nice. We had our 3 favourite bartenders that we would hunt down to get a drink. They were Santos at the pool bar, Erick who worked pretty much everywhere, Jesus who was usually down at the bar by the beach, and Alfonso the Spa Manager was great. My favourite drink is the Melon Sour, but probably 80% of the time, no one had the proper mix to make my drink. Then I met Jesus, and when he said he had no Melon Sour mix, he offered to make me something like it. From that point on it was my favourite drink! It had no name, but it was pink and slushy and tasted absolutely amazing! Every girl that was in our group starting finding Jesus to make the drink for them too! The room that we got was very nice, huge bathroom, lots of counter space, and a huge tub. We went into some of our friends rooms, and they would smell disgusting, like wet and mold, and just be filthy. A couple of our guests had to request a new room (which was no problem). The walls were paper thin, so you could hear every person walking up and down the stairs, slamming their doors, moving stuff in their room. I LOVED the bed. I slept better at the resort than I do on my own bed. But I LOVE the firm mattresses. Most of our guests did not like the beds as much as we did. The nightly entertainment was not good at all. It doesn't even compare to the other two resorts I have stayed at. We went to the 70's and 80's show one night, and we couldn't even stay to watch the whole thing. The best part of the show was when they played music clips on the big tv screens on either side of the stage. The staff didn't do any singing like the other resorts I have been to, it was all lip-syncing, and the majority of the time the staff had no idea what the words to the songs even were. And a couple of the staff could dance, but the rest of them looked like they had no idea what they were doing. The daily entertainment seemed almost non-existent. We played beach volleyball once, and then I never heard of any other activities going on. Unlike other resorts where they have dance lessons and spanish lessons and beach soccer and pool volleyball and water excercises and anything else you can think of. The Viva Wyndham Maya is definitely the best resort for daily and nightly entertainment. Staff would constantly be coming around trying to get people involved and to have fun. It was tons of fun at that resort. The beach was absolutely amazing. Tons and tons of chairs, no matter what time of day we went down to the beach, we were always able to find chairs. The pools were nice, the only weird thing was that the pool that had the bar in it, was also the pool that had the kids pool area in it. So when we would be sitting at the bar drinking, there would be kids running around screaming and splashing everywhere. I didn't understand why they set it up like that? We personally never had an issue with the time share people, I think they targeted the older crowd that looked like they had money. But we did hear lots of bad stuff about the time share people. And at one point during our trip there was a huge fight between a guest and a time share person. I heard that the guest was not given ALL of the information before he signed something, and was told that he owed them money, so he was furious. It's better if you just stay away from them. But you can't really tell who is a timeshare person, because they all have Reef Playacar nametags and look like they are just regular staff. So they will come up to you and take you on a tour of the resort, then an hour later you find out who they really are. Now onto the Wedding reviews....... I had been emailing Nuris (the wedding planner) back and forth for probably 10 months to plan the wedding. When I first emailed to find out about the wedding packages, I was sent information on the buffet choices, alcohol choices, color choices and ceremony choices. The one thing I would like to say is that they should work on getting more and better information to the bride and groom on their choices. There were a few aspects of the wedding that I thought were included in my package price, being the reception centerpieces, and the reception dance floor (if you are having your reception on the beach). I was never asked if I wanted to add these items to my quote so up until I arrived at the resort (4 days before the wedding) I had no idea that these things weren't included and that I had to pay an extra fee to have these things. That was the first thing to disappoint me. Then the night that we arrived (we didn't arrive until 9pm or so), after I checked in, I had to find Nuris so that we could have a meeting to pick out my flower choices. I had asked numerous times if she could just let me know the flowers that were in season for the end of November, so that I could choose them before I arrived in Mexico. But I was not allowed to know what flowers they offered until I got there. So after a LONG day of travelling, I had to meet with Nuris to pick out my flowers. And by that point I was grumpy and exhausted so I really didn't even care to think about wedding stuff at that point. I picked my flowers, bridesmaid flowers, groomsmen boutinnieres, father and grandfather boutinnieres and mother of groom and mother of bride corsages. We were told that all the flowers would be in my room by 2pm on the day of the wedding (the ceremony was to start at 4pm). On the day of the wedding (after 2pm), while I was busy getting ready, my mom was stuck running around the resort trying to find out why the flowers had not been delivered yet. She went to Nuris' office and they were all sitting on her desk, so my mom grabbed them and a stranger offered to help her carry them all to my room. Then my mom finds out that the father and grandfather boutinnieres are missing, so she has to run around the resort again looking for Nuris to find out what happened. Turns out that those two boutinnieres were never even ordered. So my mom had to wait for the florist to rush through the two missing boutinnieres and then bring them to my room. By this point it is already 2:45pm and my mom hasn't even started getting ready yet, so now she was in a panic as she was supposed to be in my room by 3pm for when the photographer arrived. We were also told by email that we had to pay for the flowers at the resort, and it had to be paid seperately in US funds. My mom brought the money for flowers in US funds, and when she went to pay, she was told that she had to go to the front desk and exchange the US money into pesos, because they would not accept US money for the flowers. This is ridiculous because we were specifically told we could NOT pay with pesos and we HAD to bring US money to pay for them. This was the second thing to disappoint me. I had also requested to Nuris that each row for the ceremony have 6 chairs in it. I later found out that my dad and a couple guests had to go down to the beach and fix the chairs themselves, as the people setting up would not change the chairs around like my mom had already asked them to. This was the third thing to disappoint me. I had asked Nuris to find 50 to 60 sparklers for me, so that each guest could light one and stand around the stage for when my husband and I had our first dance. We ended up spending $150US for 50 sparklers, and when the guests tried to light them, they didn't even work. So that was $150 bucks down the drain. This was the fourth thing to disappoint me. I had asked Nuris for the DJ's playlist so that I could see what type of music he had for the reception. He had no country music, so he told me to just make a list of all artists and songs that I wanted for the reception. I spent a long time asking family and friends if there were any special songs they wanted on the playlist, and I made a massive playlist of all of the special songs that I wanted played at our reception. When I went to the DJ to request a country song, I was told that he had no country, and that Nuris had never sent him the playlist that I had requested. I was extremely disappointed, as all of our guests are from Calgary, and love country music, and we didn't have a single country song to dance to that night. Instead of paying all that money for a DJ, I should have just had my ipod on shuffle so that the music we liked was actually playing. This was the fifth thing I was disappointed about. Originally, in emails, I had been told that the DJ had a microphone that our MC could use, and we could use it for all of our speeches as well. When we had our meeting the night I arrived to the resort, I was then told that we had to pay $200US for a microphone and speaker system because we were not able to use the DJ's. I was angry, but whatever, I got over it. Then, at the reception, the microphone didn't even work! It would keep cutting out, half of the speeches you couldn't even hear! And our MC spent most of his time wandering around the reception area trying to find where the microphone would work best. This was the sixth thing I was disappointed about. We had our wedding day planned 8 to 10 months before the actual wedding. We had planned to arrive to the resort the night of Saturday November 19th, then the Monday morning November 21st at 10am we were supposed to get our bloodwork done for the legal ceremony. And then on the Wednesday November 23rd was the ceremony day. The day before we were leaving for Mexico, I received an email from Nuris saying that the Monday when we were supposed to get our bloodwork done, was actually a holiday and she wasn't working that day, so now we had to rearrange all of our plans (and our witnesses plans) to change our bloodwork to the Tuesday, the DAY BEFORE THE WEDDING. When numerous times I had been told that they needed 3 business days between taking the blood and the ceremony so that the wedding could be legal. So I start freaking out thinking that we wouldn't be able to legally get married now because somehow for 10 months they forgot to tell me that the Monday was a HOLIDAY! Nuris ends up rearranging plans so that the Monday morning at 10am, we get our bloodwork done with another staff member, and our witnesses sign all the papers. Then we have to have another meeting on the Tuesday at 10am for the rehearsal and final details. Two of my bridesmaids were not staying at the same resort as us, so now they had to pay for a cab to come to our resort twice for meetings, instead of once like it was originally planned. So on the Tuesday at 10am, I make sure my entire wedding party and all the grandparents and parents are all ready and waiting for Nuris to start the rehearsal. I would like to add that the Monday night was our Coco Bongo night, so everyone was extremely hungover and not in a good mood. Once we find Nuris, she tells me that she never told me the meeting was at 10am, that it was supposed to be at 11am, but she will rush through to finish what she is doing so that we don't have to wait long. The group of us head down to hang out by the pool while we wait for Nuris to arrive. I believe it was around 11:15am that she finally showed up to do the rehearsal with us. This was the seventh thing I was disappointed about. The judge performs the ceremony in spanish, so we asked my husbands step-father to read the ceremony in english following the judge. He was very honoured but extremely nervous to do this, and he asked if I could get him a copy of the ceremony so that he had time to read it over and practice. Nuris told me that she would email it to me the week before we left for Mexico. When I emailed her back to ask her for it, she told me I could get it when we arrive. So when we arrive, I ask her for it. And she tells me that she can't get a copy until the day of the ceremony. He never ended up seeing the copy until he had to read it at the ceremony. This is the eighth thing I was disappointed about. Nuris told me I had the option of playing the normal 3 ceremony songs, or I could pick 3 of my own. One for the wedding party walking down the aisle, one for me walking down the aisle, and one for the end of the ceremony. I picked the 3 songs I wanted and emailed them to her, all with youtube links so that she could hear what they were supposed to sound like. In our meeting the night I arrived, she asked me for my songs, as I had never sent them to her. So then I had to go through all of my paperwork to find the 3 songs, as I wanted to make sure I told her the correct ones. This is the ninth thing I was disappointed about. I also sent her 3 songs, one for the first dance, one for the father/daughter dance, and one for the mother/son dance. I was told she had them all downloaded and they were fine. While my new husband I were dancing our first dance (and the sparklers weren't lit), the song I had chosen kept skipping and cutting out and starting over. Nuris went up to our MC, and asked him if I had my ipod because the first dance song wasn't working properly. He didn't want to interrupt our dance, so when it was finished, we were asked if we wanted to hook my ipod up and dance to it again. The moment was already ruined by the sparklers not working and the song not working, so I just said no it's done. This was the tenth thing I was disappointed about. I was told that for any guests that were not staying at our resort, but were to attend the wedding, they would have to pay for a pass. The $45 pass allowed them to come in just before the ceremony started, and leave as soon as the reception was finished, and they weren't allowed to get any drinks or food unless it was the wedding stuff that we paid for. The $60 pass allowed them to come in first thing in the morning and spend the day at our resort, eating and drinking and doing whatever they wanted, and then they had to leave when the reception was over. All of our outside guests wanted to spend the $60 so that they could come for the whole day. And my two bridesmaids were booked into the spa for 10am to start getting their nails done (which Nuris knew about). The day before the wedding, Nuris tells me that my guests that are buying the $60 day pass are only allowed to stay until 4pm, and if they want to stay longer they have to purchase a second day pass. I was absolutely livid because she knew the entire time that my bridesmaids were from another resort, she knew they had the spa booked for the day, and she knew they had to stay for my wedding and reception, but yet she never told me any of this timeline stuff before. I was not okay with making my guests pay an additional $120 just to come to our resort for the wedding, when they had been told months before that it would only be $60 and they were allowed to stay for the entire day. And it wasn't fair to my bridesmaids, because had they known this, they would have had their hair and nails done at their own resort and just showed up in time for when the photographer started. In the end, my mom and sister had to argue it out with Nuris until she allowed the guests to come for the entire day and night for the $60 she had originally told us. Then on the wedding day, all of our guests were still charged the amount for TWO day passes, even though Nuris told us they wouldn't be. So my mom had to run back to the front desk to get all of our guests half of their money back. This was the eleventh thing I was disappointed about. I booked myself and my bridesmaids into the Spa to have our hair, nails and make-up done, and I also got a massage and facial. All of my girls loved their nails and hair, and I absolutely loved my make-up, hair and nails. And my massage and facial was sooooo relaxing! It was the perfect day for me because it took away all of my stress, while my mom and sister (maid of honor) had to run around dealing with all the problems. The staff at the spa were amazing! The resort recommended we use Sian Photo (Christian) as our photographer. He did a great job, I was so happy with the pictures! And he delivered the prints to me 7 days after the wedding, before we even left Mexico! I was very happy with his work! In the end, it was the perfect wedding day. The weather could not have been better, the ceremony went off without a hitch. All of our guests raved about the BBQ Buffet that we had for the wedding. They all said it was the best food they had their entire trip! The set-up for the ceremony and the reception were absolutely beautiful, as we had it all down on the beach. The DJ could have been better, if I requested a song it would usually get played right away, but if any of my guests requested a song, it wouldn't get played, so I would have to go up and request it for them, as the DJ kept playing a bunch of songs that we didn't really like. And the staff that were serving for our wedding did a great job! In the end, after getting over all of the problems, it was a great day. I heard numerous people raving about how great Nuris was, and that is a big reason why I chose this resort for our wedding. I would not recommend this resort for a wedding, as I found it difficult dealing with Nuris most of the time. It seemed like she would get annoyed with my questions, half of the time not even giving me an answer. It all turned out beautiful in the end, but if you want to get your money worth, and not deal with never-ending problems then I would suggest finding another resort. If you are not getting married but are looking for a small and beautiful resort, I definitely do recommend this resort. It was beautiful, most of the staff were very friendly, the food was good, the beach was amazing, and I thought the spa services were great!", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cGreat vacation spot!\u201d", "Author": "pittsburghric", "ReviewID": "UR121473282", "Content": "This is a great place to stay.

The hotel is very lush and jungle like. Rooms: The rooms are clean and nice. If you are unhappy with the room given you can ask to switch. We had no problem doing so. The one thing we did notice was the rooms are not very sound proof. Depending on the location of your room you can hear people walking by or people in the next room. We were awoken a few times a night by our neighbour with a phlem problem. Not the most plesant noise to awoken by but not enough of a problem to switch rooms. If you value your sleep and want to spend your day sleeping in you may want to stay higher up or at a higher star. Staff: We can't say anything bad about the staff. They are all very friendly and will go out of there way to make you happy. Beach: The beach is the best part. Its clean and the ocean is very beautiful. nice calm water on most days. It can get a few waves if it is windy. You can walk to 5th ave from your resort in about 20 minutes. Excursions: We did our own activities. We took the ferry to cozumel and snorkelled at the money bar. it was a nice place but similar to playa del carmen so a bit expensive for what was there. The shore snorkeling wasnt great as we saw more fish in Akumal We took the collectivo to Akumal for 30 pesos ($2) and snorkelled at the bay with the turtles. It was amazing. We went back taking a taxi there because we had walked back and forth into town countless times. It was our last day there so we splurged on a taxi. We narrowed it down to $20 with the taxi and paid the same on the way home. Its a must do! Why we would reccomend it: - it is a nice quiet resort. There aren't entertainment staff trying to get everyone involved in activities. They dont blast the same music on the beach so you can listen to the ocean - its a quick walk into town - Its simply a beautiful resort -staff and very friendly and nice. They have internet available at the resort for 60 minutes it is about $10. The computers were down one day and the technician wasnt able to come in. They let us use one of the hotels computers to send an email without us even asking. We were very happy with this as it was our last day and needed to send an email.) Things to do: -GO TO AKUMAL -piola is a quaint restuarant at about 36 or 38 calle off to the right of 5th ave. it has the best pizza and service. try the sangria! you can read reviews about it on trip advisor -fussion is a good place to hear live music on the beach. Service is slow so dont expect it to be fast. - veronica's massage is great. $33 dollars for a 60min message that is very proffessional and private. its not on the beach but very legite -Always confirm a taxi's price before you get in. if you arent satisfied with the price you are given in a taxi or shop try to barter them down. If it doesnt work start to walk away and they will call you back. If the taxi doesnt give you the price wait a minute and another one will come by.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "SF Bay Area", "Title": "\u201cWonderful holiday in Playacar\u201d", "Author": "ccchicasf", "ReviewID": "UR121404923", "Content": "Tropical/ jungle paradise. This resort is not the ritz but a family friendly tropical oasis. The service was a bit of hit or miss depending on the person you interacted with. The cleaning staff was nice and helpful. We had a superior room on the third floor which included a king size bed, minibar and huge tub. The balcony was unsafe for a small child so we did not use it much. The breakfast buffet was my favorite, the cooked to order Mexican dishes were great. The snack bar was available from 11 am to 2am which had a decent burger and club sandwich. The drinks from the bar were ok, somewhat watered down. Definitely bring an insulated cup to keep your drinks cold. Although the resort was pretty full for the holiday week it was easy to get chairs both by the pool and beach. The wifi fee was a bit high for something that should be free and it only worked in the lobby, also note the fee is per device so it can add up if you have multiple phones, iPad or computer. The taxi ride to Quinta is 70 pesos which is a bit steep since it's less than 5 mins away. Overall this resort is a great value and we would definitely stay here again. A couple negatives to be aware of, the sales people can be a bit pushy, overheard some of the sales folks at the restaurant laying it on thick, reminded me of a used car salesmen. Also smoking can be a bit of an annoyance since folks can smoke anywhere, some days not a bother and some days overwhelming.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Marquette", "Title": "\u201cReturning to the Reef in January 2012\u201d", "Author": "Denise D", "ReviewID": "UR121369211", "Content": "We have stayed at the Reef nine times.

Quiet hotel, nice that the evening bar is away from the rooms. Love the winding paths through the lush green tropical setting, the cenotes, waterfalls and at certain times of day seeing the Cereques. Evening lighting is gorgeous, lanterns hanging from the trees and on the beach when they have the impromptu barbeques and dinners. the Martini bar is set in the middle of the hotel under these lit up trees, the ice cream palour our kids loved too set near the waterfall and cenote. This hotel is right on the beach which is awesome, we switched from pool to beach and loved both, plently of loungers and beds with linen curtains, staff were always cleaning up empty glasses and plates so it was kept pretty clean. Can't wait to see what the beach bar will look like when it is finished! The room First room was great location - 2nd flr, quiet room, but air-conditioner broke and dripped all night, it was quickly resolved but I honestly think my husband's quick thinking to video the leaking helped. We were given a much nicer room close to the pool and had a ocean view. Gorgeous, clean and quiet, apart from the jungle like noises of the birds at certain times - but we liked that. The water does smell a bit funky,gasey but that could just be how it is down there, after the first couple of days you get over it. Yes the beds are firm but that's how I like them. Food Restaurants were good for the price we paid and staff were for the most part attentive. The Buffet was way better than I anticipated, I loved getting my custom made omelet in the mornings - Victoria was a pro. Our kids loved the pancakes and fresh pastries, my husband, the Huevos Rancheros and I loved the fresh fruit and yoghurts too. Carolina was a great host at the buffet as were our waiters Paulino who just smiled all the time, Gilbert, Servando and Mary. Lunch was also Buffet or Snack bar, we tried the snack bar the first few days but kept going back to the buffet. The Snack bar is good for pizza and hot dogs but did not like the wings there. We like the Terrazzo and the Italian restaurant was good but not amazing like some of the reviews, hard to compete with restaurants in San Francisco though, so good for the price we paid. One word of advice, ask for the price in Pesos for the wine by the bottle and make sure when you sign the bill that night that it is in Pesos, we forgot to do this one night and at check out were charged the extra $7 (US) for the price difference. Our waiters were great - Franklin, Eric and Guilarno. We had a pretty good Salmon dish one night, the chicken was a bit dry but the bruscetta was awesome as was my daughter's pasta with pesto. Bars The bars were good, we stuck to mainly the beers and margaritas, the white wine was terrible but the red good - once you got used to drinking it cold! The bars were the buffet bar, the swim up pool bar, the snack bar drinks bar, the lobby bar and the Palapas Bar by the Theatre at the front of the hotel, with pools tables, fooseball table and giant chess. This is the one that is open the latest. otherwise bar times were fine but did not really reflect the times that were advertised - the beach bar was never open til 7pm as it said it was but it was not really a problem, we asked for drinks to go after dinner and took them to the beach or back to our room. Entertainment We didn't really go for, so can't comment there. There was supposed to be some Lion King show one night but we went up there and there was a wedding reception instead. We really got to know about things that were going on by the entertainment staff on the day; i.e. the beach buffet one night, the barbeque on the beach another lunchtime so that was ok. Towels - the girl at the towel desk by the pool was very rude, we got there dead on 5pm one day and she refused to take our wet towels (despite there being a pile there) said that we had to return them to the reception as they were closed at 5 (it was about 5 minutes after), another time she wouldn't give me ping pong paddles as she said they were closed, at 5pm, also told us to go to the front desk. Twice the front desk said they had paddles but no balls! Not much good to us then. But other than her everyone was friendly. Word of warning - do not leave your towels - one of ours was stolen and the hotel wanted to charge us $35 for it, we refused and they were ok but after that we were more careful. Also when we checked out they tried to charge us for 4 towels that we had returned, someone said to us - \"welcome to Mexico\" - so I guess that is just how it is and you have to check everything before paying! All in all despite some issues our first family vacation here was good. Lastly, listen to the travel reps, do not waste half a day listening to the vacation club/time share stuff (there is alot at this hotel) and if you go to Cozumel - rent a car from a reputable company. Extra stuff Tulum is great but go by local bus, Xcaret is a must for families, snorkelling in Cozumel very cool too.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Morristown, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cAnother fun trip to Playa..........\u201d", "Author": "Sandee16", "ReviewID": "UR120916864", "Content": "Stayed at the Reef Playacar Nov 11-19. Booked on Travelocity and had my transfers though Olympus. My first impression of the resort is that it\u2019s very lush, and very well kept grounds. I really enjoyed the jungle like feel of the resort. You felt like you were in Costa Rica. After changing our room 3 times we finally got a great room on the 3rd Floor in Building 15. The 1st room was ground floor facing the Riu I believe in Building 1. We felt like we were in the basement and there was also construction going on in the room next to us. Front desk was accommodating to switch us to another room but again it was ground floor but facing the lush greens. I prefer the 2nd or 3rd floor so we stayed in the second room that night and then by noon the next day we got the 3rd floor room. Room was perfect and patio was private which we liked . Front desk was helpful. Beach is beautiful and never had a problem finding a chair at the beach or the pool. Buffet was good and we always found something we liked. The snack bar was pretty good as well. All the bars were great as well as the service. The bartenders work hard so please Tip ! They deserve it! When we go away I go to the bank and get $70 in singles. It comes in handy when you tip the maid and bartenders. Even the cooks at the snack bar.

Did not eat at the Italian restaurant\u2026 I heard it was not worth it. My suggestion would be venturing out and having a nice dinner in town. We had dinner at Xulam and it was out of this world!! It is 100% worth going to. Best service I have ever received. Now I know why it #1 on TA. Location of this resort was a big attraction to me. It is a 15 min walk into town. Also if you walk out the back of the hotel and where the hammocks are, take that road into town. It\u2019s a nice walk and a bit shorter. Some really nice houses too. The gym was the only downfall to this resort. It smelt terrible and would be scared to contract ring worm or something from the machines. Smelt and looked dirty. Yes gyms do have that smell but this was over the top. As for the spa I had a spa appointment but canceled it,. The massage room also smelt funky. It\u2019s not like a traditional spa at a hotel. It\u2019s just a room where they massage you. That is the only negative was gym and spa. I would recommend this hotel and may even stay here again next year.

They will grab you as soon as you get to the hotel to do your check-in under a \"Concierge\" identity. If you are not interested, just decline politely, and I found that even if they were insisting a bit on giving me gift certificates and that it would cost me nothing to listen, they were respectfull as I firmly said I was not interested. To the hotel managers, one delicate thing: The hotel plays a selection of music by the pool, and it's very nice and relaxing in the morning and a little more upbeat in the afternoon wich is great. The only thing is that some people will bring their own music to the beach or pool, and play it on speakers rather than earphones. At one point I was stuck between Bob Marley playing by the pool, classical playing to the right and hi-hop playing to the left. If everybody starts playing their own music, the place will not be as relaxing as it is at the moment! ;-) All in all, it was a great relaxing vacation with people from different countries, great staff and I would definatly go back!", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cVeryyyyyyyyy disappointing!!!

Nobody helped us to our room (rooms are not easy to find here) nor did they help us with our luggage to our room. Air conditioner did not function properly and was very loud. We called maintenance and they came 3x and each time they did nothing (literally nothing) and said they would be back in a moment however they never did come back nor did they fix the air conditioner.

The resort does NOT offer FREE WI FI--really??????? nope you had to pay 12.00 U.S per day. How ridiculous. If you wanted specialty liquor you had to pay xtra for that. If you wanted specialty coffees you had to pay xtra for that. No poolside or beachside service AT ALL. 1 buffet with less than average food.

It rained 5 of the 7 days we were there, we had a \"food mixup,\" and it took forever to get our fridge stocked daily... but overall, I would still go back! STAFF: The Reef Staff were all very friendly and accomodating. I have to give special notice to Felix (the pool bartender) and Charlie (the photographer), they made our stay even that more delightful! They went above and beyond to make us feel welcome! The entertainment/activities staff were also very welcoming and friendly! There were always activities going on if you were interested... ATMOSPHERE: The resort is absolutely beautiful- with it's jungle-like atmosphere and the fabulous beach, you really can't go wrong with the ambiance... FOOD: The food was just average. Don't get me wrong, the food at the buffet tasted good (especially the Omelet Station and the Pasta Station- YUM!), but the buffet would've been great if they had more of a variety from day-to-day. The snack bar food was delicious (nachos, hamburgers, french fries, etc...) if you like more \"American\" food. I wouldn't recommend the Italian restaurant if you are allergic to seafood (every dish seems to have seafood in it). My husband was given mussels in his dish, told them he was allergic to seafood so they returned it, but then they came back and after eating some of it, he realized there were still mussels in it!!! I will say however that the restaurant manager and his boss were very quick to remedy the situation when they offered us upgraded meals and eventually a room discount. The Grill/Steakhouse was absolutely fantastic! The steaks were delicious, the soup and salad was excellent, and the dessert was too die for! SERVICE: The service was generally very fast and friendly; with the exception of trying to get our room fridge stocked daily... That was like pulling teeth. It took several phone calls every day/night to get someone to come and restock our fridge. BUT- considering all of the other great service, we could live with that... I mean, there were free drinks a few feet away from our building at the pool bar or restaurant, so we didn't let that bother us too much. THE DOWNSIDE: The most annoying and worst part of the hotel/resort are the timeshare people. They are everywhere! And contrary to what others have said, they did not leave us alone after we told them \"no thankyou!\" They hounded us every day and then got an attitude when we didn't agree to do their presentation. If they would've kindly let us go about our business, the experience would've been much more pleasant. OVERALL: I would definitely go back to The Reef. I would try to get a similar room as we had, I would avoid the timeshare people like the plague, I would skip the Italian restaurant, and I would also make sure to make time for \"other activities.\" And next time (since we won't be on our honeymoon) I'll be sure to check out the \"nightlife\" and entertainment. We're sorry we missed that. While we were there, we did a lot of \"side excursions\" that I would highly recommend: Xplor (ziplines, cave swimming, rafting, and ATVs) was amazing and totally worth the money, and swimming with the Dolphins at Delphinus was a once in a lifetime experience- while it was a little spendy (the pictures were outrageous), I wouldn't trade it for the world. We also went parasailing which was (again) completely worth the money and was unbelievably fun; and lastly, we got a couples massage down on the beach which was out of this world!

I will try to break down what we liked and didn't like. Food- buffet was like what we've eaten at other all inclusives in Mexico. Good food but not the best ever but honestly who expects it to be? There are plenty of choices at the buffet and the snack bar. A la carte restaurants...We did not like Botticelli that much but the Terraza Grille was awesome. Bars - this is the first time in Mexico we spent more time at the beach than by the pool. The bar closest to the beach la Chiquita I believe, had Jesus as the bar tender (that just sounds funny) and Alex on the beach taking orders and picking up cups. These two guys were absolutely fantastic! The bar by the pool was also great even though we used it twice. We never hit up the late night bar but we could hear the music til about midnight. Rooms- I noticed as a common occurance on here that you would get a room that had two doubles vs 1 king even though you reserved 1 king. We were told they didn't have any rooms with kings but to check back in the morning. They switched us but they were very hesitant and kept asking if we were sure we wanted to switch. The walls are thin and there are some large gaps between the doors so you can hear when your neighbors shower, and leave in the morning. In our first room in the closet there was a door to the next room, it was sealed, not well, so we could hear our neighbors tv and when they were going through their closet it sounded like they were in ours. Second room did not have that so it was quieter (333) we stayed on first and second floors and agree they feel secure even though we never felt our security was threatened. The front doors did have slats but they were decorated that way not actually open as other reviews suggested, you can tell when you close the door from the room because it was completely solid on the other side. The safes are built into the wall (they can hold and iPad and many other things) but you have to rent the locks ($2-3) a day. We always kept our valuables and passports in here with no issues. The rooms are musty and you see some moldy spots in certain corners but people have to remember that it's humid all summer, the a/c is usually on 24/7, and people rarely open up all the windows and sliders to air out the room. Time share/ vacation package people - they try and get you to a welcome breakfast or lunch but having been to enough of these in Cabo and ixtapa we know what to expect and since the excursion discount wasn't that big we opted out. They put up a bit of a fuss but they let us be and no issues. Hotel grounds - awesome. It's like you're in the jungle and then when you hit the pool area you are looking at the carribean and have cabanas and chairs with umbrellas. The employees whether porters, maintanenece, house keeping, bell boys, etc always say hola with smiles. The gym was good (weights are in kg) , treadmills, elliptical, a quasi smith rack/ bench, lots of free weights, stationary bike, sit up machines, etc. They have these half squirrel half possum things around which are cool as well as a friendlyish raccoon. We saw something that looked like a lemur but no one could say what it was. They were building a new bar by the second pool, so hammers and chainsaw during the weekdays. It didn't bother me since I had my iPod but for others that could be annoying. It was also close to the cabana where they give massages, which seems like it would be hard to relax while hearing a chainsaw 30 feet away. Random bits- we did the Xplor park which was awesome! My wife got bit up by bugs( we even brought repellant) not sure if it's from the grounds, the room, or what but this happens in Mexico. Look at people's legs on the way home at the airport, you will see you're not alone. Negotiate cab fares before you get in. I think you get better rates on excursions through expedia than through hotel. More Europeans here than on the west coast of Mexico so that meant more topless women (this is good and bad depending on the age) and more speedos (always bad). .", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria, Canada", "Title": "\u201cThe timeshare experience\u201d", "Author": "d4dogs", "ReviewID": "UR120526377", "Content": "My wife and I were walking down 5th av, in Playa del Carmen and were approached by a man, who wanted us to visit the Reef Playacar.

We were there last Oct. and decided to return this year for two weeks and brought more people with us. Not only did they not give us the \"special treats\" that they promise to repeat clients,they didn't even know we had been there before.So we got nothing,not even a note.Last year when we arrived in our room we had tee shirts,a bottle of wine,chocolate covered strawberries and body lotion.None of that matters. What matters is they took a great resort and turned it into a zoo.Last Oct. and the times before there were no menu items that were extra,no drinks that you couldn't have and you certainly did not have to pay for coffee. in the lobby:( There were no \"time share people all over the resort)the problem now seems to be that there are people working at that resort that are thieves.After being there for four days,we return to the room to discover my phone had been stolen. We went to the customer service desk to report it,so what do they do search my room. REALLY. They informed us that they could find out who came and went in that room.they stuck some type of computer thing into the bottom of thee door handle ().Didn't know they could do that ) Went back days later only to be told that it wasn't working. Of course.A few days later went back to the same desk and was told no one was in the room but my husband and myself.What I wanted to know was who was cleaning my room and how were they getting in.After spreading the word about the theft we heard from 2 other couples that had money stolen from their rooms. Not a couple of bucks but hundreds.Of course none of us got anything back,but I didn't expect to.Now we are home and get the phone bill $160.00 in phone calls to Merida Mexico,those calls were made from the time I reported my phone stolen and the time it took to have it shut down. We have traveled a lot over eighteen years..NEVER have we had anything stolen and if you let something sit and walked away you could find it in lost and found,not any more.I used to love the Reef,but the food has gone downhill I can't deal with the time share idiots and i won't deal with thieves by the way my husbands sun glasses also disappeared. But the beach is very nice .I have seen nicer ,but is is nice.I believe that The Reef has just gotten greedy and they really don't care about the people that come there.The staff was great as they always are, but something has to be done about security.No more reef for me........:(", "Date": "November 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLoved it...but\u201d", "Author": "Tashxxo", "ReviewID": "UR120138758", "Content": "I went to the reef with my boyfriend for a week in October. First off location, the hotel was beautiful it was like a jungle trees and plants everywhere! It was small which we loved easy to get from one point to another. The beach was great! Always I spot to sit there was room got everyone it was nice not having to wake up extra early just to get a spot. The only thing I didn't like about the location is that we were so close to the road you could see the busy steet from the upstairs bar and lobby. Thats just me, I thought we would be a little more secluded. Food: the buffet breakfast and lunch were usually good, but we could never find anything good at dinner we ate at the el carte for dinner almost every night which were great and had the most amazing service. My boyfriend and I still crave the ranch BBQ salad from the grill ! Bar: the bars were awsome great drink we only had a problem one night when my boyfriend ordered 5 shot of tequila. When he took the shots we could tell they werent tequila we didnt complain on the mess up on the shots but soon after he asked for $40 he said that it was premium vodka and we now had to buy the whole bottle even though it was 3 quarters empty. We said no due to the fact we didn't even order the vodka. The bartender insisted we pay grabbed my boyfriend wrist and told him to leave then called security. Luckily there were some girls that defended us because they heard our order. We left anyways. Rooms: the rooms were nice they got cleaned and stocked with pop and water everyday. But the walls are paper thin! We could hear everything including slamming doors and the couple next to us that fought everynight. We were on thr ground level and to tell you the truth we both didn't feel 100% safe even though are doors, windows and safe were locked. We just had a weird feeling. If we were on a higher level I think I would have felt a little but different about it. I did request a higher level room when I booked but I never received it, and didn't bother to ask for one. There was some construction while we were there right next to the buffet so every time we ate it was VERY loud, the construction made the hottub un useable.

We checked out a day early and moved for the next 3 nights to a much more secure resort nearby until we were able to fly home. That being said, Stayed in room 813 a jungle view 1st floor room. The room and bath was spotless, the beds were comfortable enough. I am used to Mexican firm, others who enjoy pillow top softness may need to adjust. The older patio door already shaky on it\u2019s runners would certainly not withstand hurricane force winds. The only enclosed public space without a palapas roof was the theater. A flat roofed windowless room without toilet facilities. I would not want to be hold up there in a storm.

We got a good deal on the vacation and I think we got what we paid for. The food wasn't great, but it was filling and edible. The drinks were pretty good. It seemed like the frozen drinks had very little alcohol, but the mixed drinks the rum and coke had a bit of a kick to them. The only downside is that their cups are pretty small, so we found ourselves order 2 at once so we didn't have to go to the bar very often. I saw a few people with mugs, they had the right idea! The bartender will fill it up for you. If you are sitting near the beach there is a very nice waiter, Alex, who comes by to pick up your empty cups, he will also bring you drinks if you ask. If you don't ask, you don't receive! The rooms were decent. We booked a king sized room and when we got there we were given a room with two doubles. When we told them that we would like a king bed, they said that they did not have any more available but they would get us in one the next day. That was a bit of a hassle, but the king sized room was much nicer for the two of us so I was ok with waiting the night. The room size was decent and clean. If you need more than two towels you'll have to request them, some nights they forgot to give us any at all! But the maids closet seems to always be unlocked, so we just grabbed our own. The beach was nice. I'm personally afraid of ocean, but the water was so blue that I ended up swimming everyday! There were lots of people in the water and the waves were fairly gentle. This hotel seemed to be the place for groups of people to go. Lots of friends together in groups. They were all very friendly. We apparently should have brought some more people! There were also a lot of Europeans on the beach so be prepared for topless women and people of different body sizes all in bikinis. It made me feel better about myself, and by the end of the trip it didn't even phase me anymore!

All of this was fine until \u201cThe Bad\u201d happened. Before we left the registration area, we were approached by person wearing a resort name tag and asked us to come to the Concierge Desk for some additional information. I was thinking they were going to provide us with a map of the resort and an activities list. We are immediately asked to take a 90 minute tour of the resort which would provide information to make our stay more pleasant but we had to bring a card card, identification, and put down a $20 refundable deposit. When asked if this was a time share sales presentation, we were told no and I quote: \u201cWe are not selling time shares.\u201d We did not participate but did over hear one of the salesman tell another couple it was $4000 per year for 25 years. We did speak with one couple who informed us the 90 minute presentation was 3 hours of their time wasted. Seems reasonable\u2026.RIGHT\u2026.. So with that being said, steer clear of the \u201cNo Time Share Salesperson(s)\u201d unless you are looking to invest in one. Second part of the story. We were having some communication issues with our transportation agencies (Olympus - Roberto) and when we went to the concierge desk to ask for assistance, the supervisor stated \u201cWhy should I help you, you didn\u2019t participate in our time share presentation.\u201d He also stated that he and the others there are not part of the hotel, but part of the time share only\u2026.WOW\u2026Wearing a Reef Resort name badge, in the Reef Resort lobby, at a Concierge Desk and doesn\u2019t want to assist a customer. Can you say GET ANOTHER JOB\u2026. I immediately went to the Front Desk and was promptly assisted by a staff member (Fernando). Now that\u2019s great customer service. Now to the GOOD. The resort is very nice, clean, and accommodating. All staff members were very helpful and attentive. The food was very good and there was a wide variety in the buffet area. We ate at the snack grill and both restaurants as well and they also very good. Both pool areas are very nice and the beach area is wonderful. All four bar areas for very nice and have a wide selection of drinks. I would like to especially thank Alex (beach bar area) for his hard work. He had only been employed at the Reef for four days, but wow, he went way above and beyond. He was always pleasant, had a smile on his face, and proficient at his work. The Reef would do even better if more staff members would follow Alex\u2019s lead. For the diver\u2026..I can not say enough about David, Stephan, and Bruno. They are extremely knowledgeable and very accommodating. My dive buddy and I had seven dives with David and two Cenote dives with Stephan. They dive shop has everything you need with top of line AquaLung equipment. For those Nitrox certified divers, it is included a no additional charge. If you are thinking about getting certified, they provide an intro to scuba at the pool at no charge. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the Reef Resort and the Reef Resort Marina (Dive Shop).

I had previously stayed at Blue Bay Grand Esmeralda with my husband in the spring. The Reef Playacar is a small resort with around 200 rooms. The resort turned out to be better than I anticipated. The grounds are beautiful with a cenote and tropical foliage situated between the various buildings. We did not arrive until late on Saturday, October 8th. After checking in, we were escorted to our room. We were put in a room with a king size bed so I called the front desk and said that we requested double beds. Within 10 minutes we were moved to a room with double beds in building one. We were told that it may be loud as it was close to the bar and if we wanted to move to a different room in the morning after people checked out, they would move us. We took them up on the offer and by 12:30 the next day we were in another room. We were very pleased with the room we were given: 1634. The rooms are small but clean. There is a little balcony with two chairs. No coffeemaker \u2013 we asked and were told it only comes with a superior room \u2013 not sure what that is. Ours faced the inside of the resort which gave us a view of the tropical garden. There are two windows but neither one had screens on them so we did not like leaving them open but you almost had to open the one in the bathroom as there was no way for steam to escape when you showered. I did see some small ants on the vanity in the bathroom \u2013 not sure where they were coming from. Room was quiet \u2013 there are only 3 floors in each building with 4 rooms per floor. We never had a problem sleeping. As stated in other posts, you do need to rent a lock for the safe at $2.00 a day. There are two pools, one with a swim-up bar and baby pool. There is also a hot tub. The beach area is beautiful \u2013 very wide with plenty of chairs. I do not know if the resort was full but we never had a problem getting a good spot around the pool. They have lots of beds with canopies over them and we were able to get one of them a couple of days. You have to get up to get your drinks when you are at the pool \u2013 there is no waiter who comes around but the area is not that big and there is a bar right up from the pool. Felix at the swim- up bar is an awesome bartender. Restaurants \u2013 there is a buffet which is opened for all meals and there are two sit-down restaurants that are opened in the evening. You do not need reservations for the sit-down restaurants. There is also a restaurant that serves burgers, pizza and hot dogs by the pool during the day and tacos and pizza at night. I found the buffet to be tiring \u2013 a lot of the same food at every meal. Tried both sit-down restaurants and the food there was okay but they both were not opened every night so your choices were very limited. There are several items on the menu at the sit-down restaurants that cost additional money. My friend didn\u2019t mind it \u2013 this was her first time to Mexico and she loved everything about it where I was comparing it to Blue Bay which has many restaurants and a wide variety of food. Entertainment \u2013 there is a show every night near the rooftop bar. We only saw two \u2013 70\u2019s show which the staff put on. They worked very hard and did a good job. We also saw the Mexican show and this was excellent \u2013 these were professional dancers. There is a rooftop bar and if you want to hear bands, you are 20 minutes walking distance from downtown Playa or a $7.00 taxi ride. We did have some rain towards the end of our stay and the staff did come around letting us know of other inside events they had going on to entertain the guests. All in all, I would go back to this resort again. The resort is quaint and the grounds are beautiful. We did not pay a lot for this vacation so we feel we got what we paid for. I wish they would up the room price a few dollars to include the safe and the coffeemaker. I just feel that these things are usually always included in all-inclusives. A little more variety on the buffet would also be great.

Cleaning staff were thorough and we never saw them. Food: Buffet was great plenty of choices for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. If you cant find something here you are to picky. Snack bar was awesome, burgers, dogs and wings were great. Specialty restaurants were great, service is wonderful, food is great choices are limited by menu but we had different meals on 4 different nights. Bars: Although the amount of bars are limited I didnt see anyone wait more than a few minutes for a drink, bartenders are great Jesus at the chiquita bar is incredible, as is Felix at the pool bar, take care of these guys they work hard to keep your glass full and to make sure you have a smile on your face. They dont use cheap liquor or water down drinks, if you want top shelf they let you know up front there is an extra charge, but regular drinks are great. Staff: After a couple days most staff remember your name and everyone has a smile and a friendly \"HOLA\"everywhere you go. If you have problems go see Roberta at guest relations she is the most incredible person I may have ever met, she solves problems and schedules things I thought impossible. Irving, Miguel, Gladys, and Gilbert in the Chula Vista were the best. Pools: Well maintained and plenty of space Beach: Incredible is an understatement plenty of chairs, you can walk the beach to town in about 10 minutes. In short dont listen to the naysayers about the REEF club, we have stayed here 4 times and will be back, I would love to keep this place a secret but I cant stay here you wont regret it.

This was me and my husband's second time traveling to this area. The previous time we stayed at the Gran Bahia Principe Tulum a 5 star, larger resort. We wanted to be closer to Playa Del Carmen and stay in a smaller resort and the price was right at the Reef so we booked. LIKES LOCATION - 10 minute beach walk to Playa Del Carmen...nice to be able to drink at Senior Frogs then take a nice beach walk back home BEACH - Amazing. Can snorkel right off the beach, clear waters, white sand, not crowded and calm waters. ATMOSPHERE - The grounds are amazing, liked that you felt you where in an actual jungle not a concrete jungle. The coffee area and ice cream parlor is a nice touch! DISLIKES ROOMS - The rooms where clean and your typical resort room, maid service was excellent, and air conditioner good however, it made my dislike list because if you don't upgrade you have a horrible view and like others say...if people are in the \"hall\" it sounds like they are in your room. I brought ear plugs and still couldn't get decent sleep. SERVICE - Unfortunetly this made my dislikes list as well due to the front desk staff being overly rude to my husband when he inquired about an umbrella on a rainy day. One of the bartenders who was in the upstairs bar (didn't catch his name) was SO rude anytime I would get a drink to the point where I just made my husband go for me everytime. The service I recieved at the pool bar from FELIX was amazing, best bartender ever! The service in the buffett was always great. FOOD - Okay...I personally didn't mind the food but the couple we were with hated it. I never had a problem finding food I liked at the buffett but some things I tried just weren't good. My husband and I were really looking forward to an a la cart meal and got dressed up only to find one was closed and the other that was opened only had 2 items on the menu \"free\" the rest you had to pay upwards from $20 American. If I was going to pay for a meal i'd just go into town...and thats just what we did. ENTERTAINMENT - Some people might hate the dance music blaring from the pool area but I enjoy it and instead I got faint Mexican classical music at the Reef. This is not a resort for the younger crowd as there is no disco (at least the week we were there) and the activities during the day were lacking. There were nightly shows at 9pm everynight...well I wish. Out of the whole week there was only 3 shows we went to (Pop Show, 70's show) they were bad but entertaining and had us laughing, (Mexican Night - great show) we enjoyed those nights. The other nights were a show for kids, kareoke and casino night (no thanks!) and that was a little disappointing. I'm pretty impressed with my stay at this 3 star hotel compared to the 5 star I stayed in previously. We debated this resort with the Wyndham resorts and Grand Coco Bay (All around the same price) and just from what I saw dropping people off and picking them up I think we made the best choice. If you are debating this resort with the others I'd say you won't be disappointed. The only thing that was a bit disappointing about the resort really was the entertainment....lack of music at the bars, no disco and nightly shows...in the end though your trip is what you make of it!! Have fun! Recommendation - Eat out at Alux Restaurant in Playa Del Carmen. You eat dinner in an actual underground cave.

It was very clean and bright with a nice sized closet and good air conditioning. The bathroom was spacious with a nice deep tub to keep the water off the floor. I loved the window in the shower to look out at the gardens. The grounds at The Reef are beautiful. You can see that they put in a great deal of effort to keep things looking very nice. The pool could have used some work, specifically the pool bar which was getting a little run down looking. We didn't spend much time there so it didn't bother us. The beach had plenty of chairs and shade and was a very quiet place to relax. We spent most of our time out there. We also took advantage of the included non motorized water sports. Kayaking in the ocean was wonderful! We found most of the staff to be very friendly and helpful. Jesus, the bartender near the snack bar, was always very friendly and funny. We never had to wait long anywhere for a drink. The whole atmosphere at the Reef is very relaxed which was exactly what we were looking for. It is also one of the closest hotels to town which makes for a very convenient walk. Like others have said, he food in the buffet is not good at all. I know it is hard to please so many different types of people but all the food was very bland. Breakfast was the best time to go. They had good sausages and a lot of good bread choices. We stuck to the snack bar for lunch which had great burgers and hot dogs cooked upon order. The nacho bar was good too. Dinner was not great but they had a lot of salad choices. We checked out the other restaurants but without paying more, we weren't impressed with the menu items. I personally don't mind that the food wasn't spectacular because I hate over eating on vacation but it could have been better. They would also be wise to have the Chula Vista air conditioned. It was fairly unbearable to sit and eat in the heat. The nightly shows weren't as good as other shows I've seen at resorts but they were okay. We only went to a couple and they were entertaining enough. I would most definitely return to The Reef. I had a hard time finding anything to complain about except the food. It is a wonderful place to stay for the money. I did not want to leave.", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Appleton, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cReef Playacar - review\u201d", "Author": "Beachlover30330", "ReviewID": "UR118743428", "Content": "My husband and I (36 and 34) stayed at The Reef Playacar from August 22-30th. Overall I would stay at this resort again if the price was right. Those that say it is within walking distance of Playa are people that can handle the 90 degree 90 percent humidity better than I can, however, I found that I did not mind the $7 or 70 peso cab ride to wherever I wanted to go in Playa. We did walk one day but found by the time we got there we were dripping wet and did not really enjoy being there. I have to admit that this is one of the most relaxing vacations to the Riviera that I have had in a long time. We booked with Book-it and used BestDay transfers which were seemless and on-time. We found ourselves arriving before check-in which was expected so we decided to check out the resort and grab a bite to eat. Upon first walking into the only buffet restaurant I really did realize what everyone meant by the limited food selection. It was good - do not get me wrong - but it was just very lacking. We ended up only eating breakfast at the buffets (which was the best meal in my book and very comparable to other all inclusive resorts we have stayed at including the Iberostar, Barcelo, Xcaret, Now Jade) - then we would grab a burger or nachos at the snack bar (which were good for a Mexico burger) and then we went to the a la cartes to eat dinner. We found ourselves to be the first ones to the restaurant almost every night and must be accustomed to eating much earlier than others. The entire week we were there we met probably only 6 or 7 couples that spoke English well enough that we could have a conversation with. This resort seems to be frequented by Europeans and Canadians very heavily (not that that is bad). So this meant that us eating dinner at 6:30 p.m. was understandably way earlier than they normally eat dinner. The Steak and the salmon at the Steak a la carte was the best and by the end of the trip I was pretty sick of it - but I certainly did not starve - which is the main reason I say - for the right price - I would go back. I found the pools to be very adequate and liked the separation - I like the fact that you can see the beach from the pool and - YES - everyone is exactly correct - THIS is the best beach in the Riviera - (unless snorkeling from your hotel is important to you because there is NONE of that - but okay with me on this trip). It is beautiful and very good for swimming. There were always enough chairs and usually even a bed or two open for getting there later in the day. We did see some of the small bugs that people spoke about - although I was not bothered by them as much as others (they did not bite). We upgraded our room so we had a great air conditioner and our bed was very comfortable. We had troubles with the pillows the first night so we went to the front desk and got 2 softer pillows - they brought them right away and I slept as well if not better than I do at home. In fact a few nights I woke up and forgot where I was\u2026\u2026. The negatives of this resort could be easily corrected - I think the staff for the most part was good - but there are a few people who you could tell did not want to be there. If they would turn the beach massage area into a bar it would be fantastic and a very well received investment. The only bathrooms are by the restaurant so if you are in the upper pool by the swim up bar it is probably just as close if not closer to your room to go to the bathroom than to their facilities. Hence the reason I think many suspect that people are using the pool as their facilities (also you do not see many of those people who park their butt at the pool bar leave very often). The only other thing that would be great is drink menus. If you find a drink you like - no 2 bartenders make it the same and they all do not know the names of everyone elses drinks. I have been to a few all-inclusives so I knew some of the drinks that should be available but if this is your first AI resort - you better have some drink recipes handy.", "Date": "September 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAn awesome place to stay!\u201d", "Author": "Cando2", "ReviewID": "UR118627065", "Content": "Beautiful beach, great setting, friendly & helpful staff.

We have traveled several times to this area and Cancun and have had great success in choosing a hotel- well not this time. I will start with the good things- the beach, it was clean and large. Most of the staff were very nice and hard working, especially the entertainment staff- this guys/gals are amazing and always smiling after putting in long hours- we Really enjoyed them. The grounds were nicely kept. Now the bad stuff- Ok first of all, while on vacation you expect to be able to relax in you room - sleep in or an afternoon siesta- well not at this place- you can hear everything. The hotel grounds crew would start mowing at 8:00 am- and sawing- yes sawing- replacing balconies. This would go on until about 6:00 pm. The food at the hotel was very poor- we went out to eat in town 3 or 4 times. The best meal by far is breakfast at the buffet. The steakhouse was just ok- the Italian just terrible - nothing more then velveeta and pasta. Also, you never know what is open- very limited hours- the buffet is not open for lunch until 12:30 and closes at 3- ok then dinner it does not open until 6:30-6:45. The ice cream is only open 3-5 and normally is either out of cones or has no spoons. The hotel walks get very slick and I watched several people fall down. Our bathroom was in need of a new bathtub- well on our 3rd day of 7- it gave loose and my husband literally when through it while showering. i tried to call the front desk- well our phone did not work. So, I went down to the front desk and i told them what happened- about 25 minutes later a staff member can up with a plunger- Ok? I told him I don't think that is gonna work. he said it will have to wait till in the morning. We waited and waited and nothing until 10:30. I was told that I would have to change rooms- but there was nothing in the same building and I did not want to repack and move into another and waste my vacation time. i checked periodically through the day to see the progress- well they just patched it instead of a new tub. They used very strong smelling epoxy- it was terrible. The guy was seating on the side of the tub fanning it with a piece of cardboard trying to speed up the drying- I went in and handed him the blow dryer- and I opened the balcony door and the sliding window to help with the fumes. We returned about 5;30 ad the room was totally closed up and it smelled horrible. However the tub was fixed and they also painted the inside- very weird. So, we used it - but we had to spread eagle and place your feet on each side -because the bottom was so mushey feeling. I did go down to the manager and voice my displeasure- what a joke. he could of cared less- then I asked what was he going to do for me - Well I finally walked a way and told him not to worry about it- he was very rude. I told him that I would make sure that people knew about what had happened an how they do not take cake of their guest at all! He just looked at me. Oh and the phone never did get fixed. Everything at the hotel is an extra charge- from the coffee in the lobby to the food in the ala cart, the safe, beer and soda in the room fridge, certain vodka and whiskey and so on. The pool bar is joined to the kiddie pool? Kids all over the bar- just not a good setup at all. The adult pool was not enforced- it had kids in it all the time. rooms were just ok- tv was awful only 3 english stations - CNN, Discovery and HBO plus. There must be a shortage on bath towel - 2-3 days we only got 1 for 2 people. With all the extra charges here at The Reef you may as well choose a better hotel that is truly an all-inclusive. All in all I would not return to this hotel ever! And yes the beds are so hard- I thought I could sleep anywhere- well not in these. We did travel with another couple and they have the same feelings about this resort.", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cNever again\u201d", "Author": "JudiLynn", "ReviewID": "UR118529628", "Content": "Just returned from the Reef and here is a short review.

The location is excellent for access to restuarants/shopping in Playa del Carmen's 5th Ave (Quinta). It is also withing an hour or less from Tulum, Xel-Ha and Coba'. Just minutes from Xcaret. The Reef is located in the gated resort community of Playacar. It is completely safe, even at night. Never once did we feel unsafe anywhere in the area. Our room was big and comfortable. The air conditioner was quiet and made for a huge relief when coming in from the hot humid outdoors. The bed was very comfy as well. My GF only wished there were more English language television channels. But hey, you're in Mexico. The resort itself is built within a natural setting of jungle and cenotes with waterfalls. It truly makes you feel you are far away. The traditional Mexican colors and polished wood and cement tile walkways make getting around the property easy. It is one of the smaller all-inclusives and as such, more attention is paid to individual guests. The food at the main buffet restaurant was really very good. The selections were far beyond what I would have expected. Just the variety of various juices was a bonus. As a coffee drinker, I was very pleased with their morning brew. Besides the buffet restaurant there was a more formal Grill and Italian Restaurant. During the day, there was a snack bar with pretty decent food for those laying around the pool and beach. The two pools were clean and always filled with people. Their main pool has a swim up bar. The beach was exceptional as well. All throughout the property were lounge chairs and cabanas for the guests to relax in. All the areas were clean, comfy and safe. Every night they had entertainment in their theater. You need to check the schedule posted in front of it on the second floor above the registration desk. It is not posted anywhere else or communicated to guests. We watched a Mexcican show one night. They also had a Caribbbean, 70's and Casino Night while we were there. One thing to beware of is the hard sell Time Share/Vacation Club.

As we knew we loved the reef before and the price had just gone down as it was within a 3 week window we dicided to give it a try again. We emailed the resort about two weeks before checkin and mentioned we had stayed there before. They emailed us right back that we would have some special gifts ready for us. Which was really nice. We were lucky to have a direct flight down, and Lomas travel took us right away to the Reef. Jhonathon checked us in and we had a room with an ocean and pool view, very nice. They have actually upgraded these rooms and they are much brighter, better AC units and the linens are improved. Our AC was so cold we had to adjust the temps a few nights. They now have nice large flat screens with improved TV channels. The resort has really made alot of improvements and the forest area has grown even more lush. As always people are always cleaning and keeping everything beautiful. The pools and beach were still perfect, we could tell they had to rebuild the beach at some point as it is not has fine of sand but there were many more loungers, and now beds that were very nice.

I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised once we got there. I went with a friend for a wedding being held there. We were two of about 50 people in our party checking in that week. Check in was quick and easy. We asked for a third floor room facing the gardens as I had read those were the nicer rooms. Once we checked in we were immediately faced with someone who wanted to schedule our hotel tour. From reading the reviews I knew this was a timeshare pitch. I told him I already had plans for the next day and was unavailable and he let me go without a fuss. Our room was decent. The beds were a bit harder than I like but they didn't prevent me from getting a good night's sleep. The air conditioning was nice and cold, which was great considering how hot and humid it was the week we were there. The fridge had 5 sodas for 2 people and was not restocked the entire week we were there. It was expected from what I had read in previous reviews and wasn't that big of a deal. The water bottles were restocked daily whether we used them or not which was nice. The rooms were clean and always well taken care of. I was also very impressed with laundry and pressing service. One day we had a bag of laundry and it was picked up in the morning and delivered early afternoon. The next day we needed a dress pressed for the wedding and it was picked up, pressed and delivered within 90 minutes. The restaurants were acceptable. Breakfast was always the best meal of the day. There was always a good variety of food available. I did not find the food bland or greasy as others have stated. I enjoyed the meals I had there every day. The sit down italian restaurant upstairs was wonderful. We had a group of 12 one day and they took great care of us. They got my order wrong and offered to redo my meal. Two things that could have been improved: 1) The restaurant wasn't always ready at the listed open times for breakfast and usually you found people waiting outside to eat. It wasn't much of an inconvenience except when you had an excursion and were on a tight schedule and 2) by the end of the week the service at the restaurants seemed to be slipping. The wait staff came around less often and one day we actually finished our breakfast before anyone came around with coffee. The afternoon tea was a wonderful touch and I would recommend you try it. The ice cream shop was open daily and offered a variety of tasty selections. As we are not big drinkers I couldn't really rate the bar service. We usually had one or two drinks and didn't have to wait very long. The staff were all pleasant. I have to commend the sports and entertainment staff. They seemed to be at the facility all day and night and were always very friendly. They put on a different show every night and although it wasn't high budget, it was always enjoyable. They remembered us every time they saw us around the facility and always made small talk. I have to say they were a big part of making our vacation very fun. We attended a wedding at the hotel and I have to say that it was exceptional. The staff did a wonderful job of setting up the site right on the beach followed by a cocktail reception and dinner on the beach as well. We had a dance floor with dj and lights and a full bar. It was a wonderful night and I was very impressed by the job the hotel did that night. Kudos to everyone. The grounds were always meticulously maintained. Everything was always clean and well cared for. I got a massage on the beach and it was wonderful. It definitely isn't a five star resort but I got my money's worth and would stay here again. It is a wonderful smaller resort.

omelets for breakfast are great! and the wait staff is great...make sure to tip..they work hard for you and a couple dollars goes a loooong way...we had our drinks waiting for us every time we went in! the grill.....good atmosphere..good food fun staff if you joke with them they play back....ask for the Mexican tom cruise. drawback...only a few options on the menu \"all inclusive\" different steaks are an extra charge. i expect an extra charge for lobster but 50$ holy crap...and if i want a sirloin instead of flank steak its another 17$...so not totally all inclusive, but i had the flank steak as i didnt want to pay and it was yummy!...nice sit down time the Italian restaurant....same as the grill..a few options the rest was up charged, and not all that great..the staff was just ok..not fun but not rude...and the food was pretty much just eh the drawback to the Ala cart restaurants is they are not open every day and you dont know when so be prepared to eat at the buffet just in case. the ice cream parlor....all i can say is all good!!! tea time...never went but was told by another traveler with me that it was nice..different types of coffee or tea with or without liquor,cookies and such all in all....the food does get repetitive but if you cant find food thats good enough to eat then you are wayy too picky!! therefore ill give the restaurants 3 stars THE BARS all the bars are open at different times ensuring that you can get a drink at pretty much any time once you figure out which is open when....and dont forget that just because the first bar doesnt open til 10am you can get alcohol for breakfast at the buffet if you wish (go mimosas) the lobby bar..while a little more \"formal\" not a bad bar..you can watch tv or play on the internet (if you pay) the hours are like 3-10 or something 3.5 stars papos bar....upstairs bar..open evenings like 8-2 or something.....while it has a pool table and music playing, or you can play the giant chess set..the service SUCKS the bartender was extremely rude and if you didnt tell him EXACTLY what you wanted immediately he would just walk off and ignore you...a total jerk!! that sucks because its the only bar open late! im giving this one 1 star only because its a nice view from the roof and cool atmosphere there is a bar by the dive shop, but i was only at that one once, when i was they were friendly so a 4 star the pool bar....here is the fun! the best bar by far!!!! jesus and miguel are the best..they are fun..will joke, play and make a show for you, ALWAYS friendly and easy to get along with!! all you have to do is say \"jesus...gimme a special\" and he will whip you up something pretty darned good, usually frozen, maybe not really strong alcohol wise, but if you want that order a rum and coke or something...vacation is all about trying new stuff! the best thing about it is you can get what you want...if you want strong...we had tequila or johnny walker red....if you want fruity or mild so you dont get wasted and ruin your day nooo problem jesus will take care of you...be sure to tip him well he is worth it! so pool bar 5.5 stars yes its over the range but it was that darned fun! THE ENTERTAINMENT you can get bikes or play ping pong, bingo, always something going on just look at the board...the staff tries really hard and are all really nice..they will sit down and eat with you, learn your name (which is a nice personal touch) get you to do a dance lesson by the pool etc...they are from all over, Germany, Mexico, USA, Denmark..a well rounded crew. Alejandro was constantly saying hi and calling us by our names and trying to get us to come to the nightly show. they do try to sell you tickets and get you to go to the club with them around 10 but same thing..not pushy at all. the shows were what i would call a high school production..quaint..not some professional show, which was nice to see normal people doing their thing. we saw a disney show (more for the kids but get the kids involved) so pretty good a 70s show with dance numbers and music from the 70s....cute! love is in the air!! a pop show where they each do a number as some pop idol like justin timberlake, madonna, j-lo, michael jackson...etc....also fun..not perfect..a few mistakes but thats part of the charm! an anything goes night where they pull audience member up and make them play games...cute..i had fun! a mexican show...professionals brought in...i liked the staffs shows better, but authentic and cool none the less! only recommendations i would have is a little more audience participation on the 70s and pop show...like a good idea would be to..after they take their bow, play one more song like we are family for the 70s or something....and the staff go into the crowd and get them up and dance with them!! it would be a great personal touch! they make a fun time even better so 4.5 stars go Alejandro! THE DIVE SHOP very nice crew.....got the impression that Bruno was getting annoyed with me because of the questions day after day (it was too windy so we couldnt dive til the last day) but the dive was great..David is a great instructor...Bruno was great on the dive, David even though he lost his mask he kept a good spirit and helped us, Stephan was very respectful and helpful.. .4.5 stars THE RUNDOWN its not totally all inclusive like you may think..with the extra charges for certain food...top shelf alcohol....internet (12$ an hr)..35$ if you lose a towel....3$ a day for the safe unless you want to upgrade......but realistically you get what you pay for and i fully believe i got WAY more than i paid for...a good solid vacation and i would go back in a heartbeat...so a definite 4 stars", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chelmsford, MA", "Title": "\u201cExcellent vacation !\u201d", "Author": "anni2000", "ReviewID": "UR117708551", "Content": "We recently returned from a 1 weeks stay at the Reef. We travelled with our 3 young adult children. We had an absolutley fantastic time .We chose the Reef based on the size, the beach, and our budget. We had read the reviews prior to going and we weren't sure what to expect. Let me begin the the staff.... in a word, just great. The desk staff was helpful and courteous, the cleaning ladies did a nice job, the wait staff and bar staff were friendly and helpful. One day, my daughter was sick in bed. The cleaning ladies came in and cleaned around her and then left her with extra bottles of water. The wait staff was also very eager to please. The man at the tourist help desk was very friendly and helped us plan our trip to Tullum, He helped us rent a car for the day and he gave us some money saving tips on tours off of the resort. The same can be said of the staff at the bar. We fouind that if we were kind and respectful to the staff, then they were as well. We did tip them throughout the day and it was appreciated. They work very hard and it gets very busy at the swim up bar. The rooms were average, somewhat small, but very clean. I only slept there, so it was fine for us.The beds were hard, but not uncomfortable. The pillows were too hard for me, so I requested something softer and I was given it. They were very sparce with the towels, but that was fixed with a phone call to the desk every day. Looking back, I should have just talked to my cleaning lady. I'm sure that she would have iven us what we wanted. The resort was beautiful and well kept. The jungle feel was authentic.The beach was gorgeous. Yes, the chairs on the beach were close together, but we just moved ours out a ways to feel a little more private. We chose a small resort because we wanted the intimate feel. We didn't want our kids at one end of the resort and us at the other. Overall, we really liked the size of the resort, although I do think that the size presented some limitations in the dining room. The food was average, but we found something that we liked at every meal. We particularly enjoyed dining on the outside patio. The specialty restaurants were good. We did have to wait to get into one of them, but this was OK with me. I have been to other all inclusive resorts where waiting was not an option. If you didn't have a reservation, you couldn't get in and reservations were hard to come by. Some of the menu items were at an additional charge. If you didn't want to pay it, then just choose something on the menu that is included. If you wanted to participate in activities, they were available, or if you just wanted to relax, it was perfect. This was a vacation on a budget and we felt that we got a good value for our money spent. Overall, I would say that this is a 3-31/2 star resort. If you are looking for fine dining and luxury, then this is not the place for you. But if you are like us, and looking for a nice place, friendly atmosphere and beautiful surroundings, then you will be very happy. You are not paying for 4-5 star accomodations or food, so don't expect it.

We got a nice room and it was comfortable. Unfortunately, the service we got and many of the hotel \"rules and regulations\" ruined our family vacation. Staff at the three restaurants was nice and really made an effort. They were the only ones, though. Staff at the bars was mostly awful (and so were their drinks) and some of the staff at the reception was very unhelpful and even rude (I got yelled by someone who seemed to be a manager at the reception). The hotel tries to make money out of everything they can. Wifi prices are outrageous and you can only use it in the lobby- what is more, they want to charge you the outrageous price for every device you want to connect! They try to charge you for using the safe in the room, many drinks and meals are not included in the supposedly \"all-inclusive\" plan, etc, etc. Food in the main (buffet style) restaurant is terrible to a level I can't even describe. Breakfast was ok (mainly because I only ate fruits and ham and cheese), but lunch and dinner were awful- food was greasy, badly cooked, just plain horrible. Food in the other two restaurants was ok (and some of it was even good) but the menu was limited (at least what was included in \"all-inclusive\" plan) and the restaurants were small (had to wait for 30 min at one of them and the hotel was not even close to being full). Restaurants are closed on some of the nights (rotating or so). The cleaning service was not great. You got the feeling they only made the bed and left. The beachfront is TINY and chairs and gazebos are all crammed in a very small space. We went there because we were traveling with my brother's family and kids stayed for free.

Our romantic dinner on the beach got rained out by a terrible storm and Elmer and the guys at the italian restaurant went out of their way to make sure we still had a great night. I would say the major drawback of this resort is how not great the food is. The food was usually just ok, we would have loved some more mexican dishes at the buffet.

The grounds were beautiful and they took very good care of them. One thing we both loved is that it wasn't a giant resort and they did their best to help the buildings blend in with the natural surroundings. The pool and beach area were great - clean and plenty of chairs/beds. Our room was clean apon arrival and cleaned very well every day.

The restaurant and bar staff were very friendly and courteous with one exception, the pool snack bar, where I waited in line for quite a while then ordered, several Spanish speaking guests behind me ordered the same food and were given their food first. I should mention this was in the daytime and the time we visited in the evening it was a different cook who was very helpful. The buffet restaurant was very good, the food was excellent quality, though not a lot of seafood besides fish. The a la carte restaurants were very nice. The food at them was cooked perfectly but over half the entrees required a surcharge of $17. At the steak restaurant the only steak available without surcharge was flank. This differed from the last place we stayed (GR Caribe) greatly where everything was included except lobster. When we booked the website said domestic and premium drinks were included. This was not the case. When my husband asked for a Crown and Coke he was told it cost an extra $15 for the premium drink wristband per day. The rooms were just O.K. and the fridge was never restocked with pop. We were only given 2 water bottles a day for the three of us and had to call the desk for extra. Our room and balcony faced a fence. The desk staff was great! The concierge however soured the whole stay. I asked for directions to the Expedia rep so I could book my shuttle back to the airport. The concierge tried to sweep us into his desk area and told us we needed to sit down so he could tell us about the hotel. As we were already late to meet 2 other couples at the Cozumel ferry, I tried to explain we only needed to book our shuttle tickets, he semi flipped out and told me he would no longer speak to me as I had a bad attitude. My husband told him he wouldn\u2019t have him speak to his wife that way and that he needed to apologize. He said, \u201c I will not apologize, look at her face she has a bad attitude and doesn\u2019t need our help\u201d In a very mocking and sarcastic manner. My husband asked to speak to his boss and he said, \u201cI am the boss\u201d I talked to the desk staff and the manager and they did assure me they would deal with it. After it was clear we were not interested in the timeshare demo we got almost no bell/taxi service until the night we left. We found the guests at the resort especially friendly and made friends with people from all over the world. The entertainment staff was also a pleasure.

The food was very good. I can't figure out how some other reviews would comment on the lack of variety - there was always plenty of choices, including some very good traditional authentic Mexican.

Every day we saw staff members sweeping the paths of leaves. The rooms were cleaned daily and to a good standard. Now for the food, plenty of choices if you go hungry its your own fault. They have two reservation restaurants a steakhouse and an Italian. We ate at the steakhouse the waiters catered to our every whim. The food was wonderful!. One really neat place was the taco bar by day it was a snack bar next to the pool and served Chicken Wings, Burgers, Hot Dogs and pizza. But what we loved after we had partied on the roof bar with Miguel the bartender, before going back to the room we stop at the snack bar where they served tacos until the early hours of the morning.The beaches were beautiful and the day beds on the beach and around the pool were great. They had 2 pools one by the restaurant and the other with the swim up bar where Jesus and Marco made sure our glasses were never empty. Take care of your bartenders and they will take care of you.

The grounds have a beautiful jungle feel and the rooms are in like a bungalow style with 3 floor bungalows with only 4 rooms on each floor! Which is fantastic because you don't get all the hotel hallway noise you experience in regular hotels! Also the buffet is good and the two specialty restaraunts were fantastic, with no reservations needed so it was nice to be able to go when you just felt like it! Also, the ice cream bar opened back up just prior to us leaving and the ice cream was fantastic, i especially enjoyed the coconut ice cream!! yum!! The Reef is right on a beautiful beach and within walking distance to 5th ave or a little taxi drive if you are not in for the walk. Our room was clean when we arrived and cleaned every day we were there and the staff were fabulous!!!

The room was clean and the bed was fairly comfortable. It was noisy at times as some reviews indicate, but who cares?! You're in Mexico! The noise level never reached an untolerable level and was generally short lived. Our room was also very close to the pools and of course the beach! The food was okay, nothing to complain about really. Our favorite meal of the day (although you can eat all day) was breakfast! We are normally very health conscious but threw caution to the wind when it came to eggs over easy with bacon!! The lady working the grill of the mornings must have been steaming hot, but every morning, she greeted us with a smile and dished out eggs made your way! The hi-light of our trip was obviously the beach! The beach was not over crowded, there were plenty of chairs and if you like to walk the beach, either direction is good people watching and sea shell finding, if that's your thing! We also went inot the beautiful town of Playa del Carmen. If you're going to eat in town, we would highly reccommend Karens and our very favorite, Adela's! Delicious steak and lobster and of course wonderful margaritas! We also met lovely tourists from Uraguay, Argentina and Norway. Everyone was so friendly! We cannot wait to go back and next time take the children and grandparents. Oh, I nearly forgot, we purchased a deep tissue massage for the birthday boy on the beach from Anna.

I went with friends and family. There were 13 of us, so we were a rather large group. I do not have any huge complaints about it. First, I will tell about the positives. The staff was excellent (with only a few exceptions). The grounds are kept up beautifully, the beach is large and there are TONS beach chairs. We never ever had any problems finding one. The rooms weren't large, but they were relatively clean, with the occasional spider and mosquito. That can't be helped though. (BRING YOUR BUG SPRAY! We got eaten alive by mosquitos!) There were lots of bars... One by the beach, one in the pool (this was the best bar, by far), one in the buffet restaurant, one in the lobby, and one above the lobby (this one was open until 2 am, which was fabulous!). The bartenders were happy to make you whatever you want (at least the ones we had) and we got drunk. Some other reviews were saying how the bartenders acted like the alcohol came out of their own pocket. Not so.. A few of them actually joined in! All of the restaurants were good and the food was always fresh. A few reviews said that the food made them sick. We never had any problems with this. But now for the negatives. The buffet got really repetitive and by the end of the week I was completely burnt out (but technically I guess it's my fault since I am so picky. I didn't like a lot of the stuff they offered.) Like I said before, the mosquitos were awful! A few of the staff were rude, but I think it may have been because some of them couldn't understand much English. We got into it with a staff member about something and in the end they were the ones in the wrong. This gentleman apologized up and down. So at least they are willing to admit they are wrong. Overall, this resort was a great value. It was one of the cheaper resorts, but I don't think we could have gotten anything better!

I'll break it down: The good and the bad by catergory. ROOMS: The good...the rooms were clean, maid service did a nice job cleaning,supplying fresh towels, ameninties, bottled water everyday. Room was average size for 4 people. Air conditioner was COLD!! That was awesome. The bad...ants all over the bathroom counter, air cond. leaked, the ceiling in bathroom leaked and bathtub would not hold water. I addressed these issues with the front desk, they said houkeeping would take care of it. Nothing was ever taken care of. The mini refrigerator was never stocked in 7 days. Only 4 cans of soda for 7 days?? It's very noisy. You can hear everything going on outside. POOLS: The good...the pool areas were clean with plenty of chairs, umbrellas and daybeds. We brought our children and they were able to play, pool snorkel and have fun. Great view of the ocean from both pool areas. It was nice to look out across the beauty while relaxing by the pool. The pool bathrooms were nice and clean. The pool snack bar had good choices that my kids would eat. Nachos, burgers, dogs, fries etc. and very fast service. The bad...the swim up bar is very crowded with lots of smokers hanging out. The pool hot tub was broken. The poolside activities are a little boring. SPA: The good...best massage I've ever had! Very relaxing/calming, enjoyable, quiet. The bad...The Spa hot tub was broken. Would have been nice to soak after such a great massage. CHULA VISTA BUFFET: The good....the wait staff was fantastic! Always asking you for refills, clearing your plates and if they can get anything else for you. We enjoyed Marco the evening waiter, he just brought drinks without asking because he remembered what we wanted. Nice selection of fruits, veggies, beverages. The white cream fruit topped cake for dessert was awesome! The bad.....the overall selection was not great. I'll eat anything because I'm not picky, but alot of the time the presentation of the food was not appealing. I love fish, but most of the time the fish was dry and overcooked. My kids hardly ate anything at the buffet, they didn't think it looked good either. I never left the buffet hungry, but would have liked to have seen more appealing meat/maindish choices that were cooked properly. BEACH: The beach was fantastic! Beautiful and plenty of chairs, umbrellas and daybeds. The Reef Marina is right there to help you with snorkel, diving, boats etc. My kids enjoyed the use of the snorkel gear that they used in the pool. PROPERTY: The grounds are very pretty. Definately one of the nicer more authentic jungle type of resort settings. The big treehouse in the center was a nice place to relax and enjoy a Mayan Coffee in the late afternoon. The property is not huge so it was nice to walk wherever you needed to go very quickly. The groundskeepers are always out there cleaning the paths and taking care of the trees. The cute little Sereques' are roaming around and are fun to watch. We even saw the babies that were just born. The only thing I was unhappy about was that the ice cream parlor was closed the whole time we were there. My kids were looking forward to that part and were sad that they couldn't enjoy it. BARS: The bars are open mostly during the day. The only place to get a drink after 10pm is the rooftop bar. The bars at the pool and in the buffet are avrage. I think they were understaffed so you had to wait a little bit to get a drink at times. I was disappointed that everytime I tried to order a mojito, I was told they were out. Huh? I never did get to enjoy a mojito :o( I do have to say that they make their drinks very strong. Mine were never watered down like I've experienced at other resorts. The bartenders were nice. OVERALL: This trip was for our kids. They had a good time , so that part made me happy. This resort is NOT luxury, but I would say it was a good value for someone justing wanting to take an inexpensive trip. I however, would most likely not return to this resort. We only go away on vacation one time a year so next time I will pay a little higher price to get more luxury/amenities.

We stayed from July 3rd through the 7th. My husband and I have been to Mexico many times but have never stayed in Playa del Carmen. We really loved this quaint little resort. It is smaller with only 200 rooms and the resort did not feel like it was at capacity. The rooms were simple but kept extremely clean. The jungle ambiance of the resort is beautiful and the grounds are kept immaculate. All the staff was friendly and accommodating. We were surprised at how good the food was in all three restaurants. We have never stayed at an all inclusive resort before and we were very pleased with the buffet restaurant and the two other a la cart restaurants. My only suggestion to them would to offer more vegetarian friendly options in the restaurants and the snack bar. I also was surprised there wasn't more Mexican fare to eat. I love Mexican food and I was looking forward to eating plenty of it but there wasn't many options I noticed. I had really been looking forward to fish tacos on our trip, but had to go off the resort to find them. The pool was great and there is a swim uppool bar, it would get pretty busy though, and I had wished kids were not allowed in that pool. They did have a pool for kids, so it would be nice to have a kid free pool. Even though it was an all inclusive with gratuity included we tipped everyone all the time including housekeeping. I doubt they make very much and a small tip goes a long way. The beach at the resort is absolutely beautiful and the hotel has lots of lounge chairs, umbrellas and beds on the beach and at the pool for guests. We walked to the 5th Ave. area of downtown Playa twice from the hotel. We could walk to downtown from the beach and the sidewalks in about 15-20 minutes. A cab ride either way from the hotel is $7 plus a tip of course. We would definitely stay at The Reef again. You can not beat it for the value you get.

I really liked the uniqueness of the resort. It seems as though they took great pains to provide a very natural setting. We felt like we were in the rain forest while walking along the trails leading from the villa to the lobby or to the beach. I loved the \"tea time\" area. It seemed like we were in a spectacular tree house having a drink. The beach was spectacular! The rooms were large and clean, but could use a little bit of an update. Overall I didn't mind our room, though. However, what I did mind was that construction began in the room right above me at 7 am! There was nail pounding and chiseling sounds that were so loud, that we has no recourse but to get up early everyday. That's not something I was planning on during my vacation. I also was disappointed in the bar-tending staff. They were very unfriendly and at times, downright rude. This was in direct contrast to all of the other wait-service staff who were very friendly and helpful to us during our stay. Also, be careful regarding the all-inclusive package. The Reef is truthful on their website and they state the different levels of their all-inclusive packages. However, if you book your trip through Priceline, Cheap Caribbean, Apple, etc. They just state that it's an all -inclusive resort. We booked an all inclusive package, but we couldn't order some of the dinners on the menu, unless we wanted to pay a significant extra charge. We couldn't order wine or any top-shelf liquors without being charged, also. In addition, if you don't purchase the correct tier of all inclusiveness, you can't have a coffee maker, free safe, bathrobe, mini-bar or room service. That was disappointing to us, as the price that I'd paid to stay at The Reef was the same as it would have cost at one of the RIU hotels that includes everyone in their all-inclusive program. In closing, a couple of other things that I truly enjoyed about staying at this hotel; It's a safe 20 minute walk to the center of Playa del Carmen. Walking around 5th Avenue was a blast! Also, the nightly entertainment that the Reef provided was quite charming. The entertainers consisted of the daytime staff. The had dance numbers and played games with the audience.

We never had a problem getting a lounge chair near the beach, but we usually didn't go until late morning/ early afternoon. Water was a little rough but we didn't care! Only down fall of the beach was all the cigarette butts. It seems like where ever you sat they were everywhere! Food was okay, but we mostly ate at buffet restaurant. We went to the grill one night for anniversary and it was great! Good food and service! We tried the Italian restaurant on night and were very disappointed, The service was horrible and food wasn't that good. It took way too long and felt like we wasted out night. Bars were okay. We had a hard time getting service at pool bar.

We though we would be able to get some clean towels before we left for snorkeling in the morning, but were given the run around. We went to where the towels were given out during the day and were told to go to the front desk because none were available until until 8 am, (it was 7:45). We went to the front desk were we were told very rudely that we could only get them at the pool and it wasn't their problem we were given wrong information. Time share people were annoying. We got a note under our door telling us that we had an \"important\" welcome package waiting for us. We had to meet with the rep. from the travel company to get our return travel information, so we went and it was a stupid \"VIP\" card that we told them to keep.

Travelling with my wife and a good friend, we were there to relax on the beach and take our friend to a few sites we visited on our first trip. We did a good bit of research prior to the trip and after staying at a 3.5 star resort last year and trying to stay within budget, we had a good sense of what to expect (or so we thought). I can tell you that our expectations were easily exceeded and I am so happy that we chose the Reef this year. The Reef is a smaller resort compared to some of its neighbors, but what it lacks in size, it makes up in charm. Our check-in process was smooth and our luggage was waiting in our room when we got there. The Rooms: We stayed in 1313 and found it to be exactly what we wanted\u2026 King size bed, large closet with plenty of hangers, a mini fridge stocked with soda and water, a flat screen TV, a safe, and a decent sized and very clean bathroom. The air conditioning worked a little too well for my wife\u2019s liking, but hey, it was hot outside. Yes, the walls and door are thin so there is a slight noise issue, but nothing unbearable or worth worrying about. You do have to pay for the safe, but it\u2019s worth it for peace of mind. A 9.5/10 rating due to the minor noise issue. The Pools/Beach: There are two pools at the resort, one with a bar and one just steps from the beach. The pool bar is nice and the service was quick. The pools are spacious and we never felt crowded, but we didn\u2019t spend much time in them to be honest. The beach was great and the surf even better. There were plenty of lounge chairs to go around, but get there early to claim one with an umbrella. Unless you like to really bake in the sun, you will need it! We usually laid our towels on the chairs by 9AM and had plenty others to choose from. Overall, a 10/10 rating. Restaurants/Food: There are 3 restaurants to choose from \u2013 the buffet, Italian, and steak house. We found the food at the buffet to be satisfactory, but somewhat repetitious. The selection was decent but always luke warm. There is a salad/fruit/dessert bar which is also decent. We tried the Italian restaurant and found it to be OK. Service was good, but not enough choice. The waiters at the buffet were great and made it a point to keep the table free of used dishes and your glasses full. Overall, the food gets an 8.5/10. Service/Staff: The staff and service was impeccable. There\u2019s really not a whole lot to say about this. Everyone you met wore a smile and always greeted you with a hello. The bartenders had our drinks figured out and a couple of times, had them ready to go before I got there\u2026 I guess they saw me coming? Jose at the lobby bar loves his card tricks and is an all around solid dude. The house cleaning/maid service was on top of their game as well. Our bedroom was always clean with fresh towels, water/soda. I forgot my wallet on the night stand one day with a few hundred dollars and not a dime was missing. 10/10 rating. (On a side note \u2013 Please make it a point to tip if the service warrants it. If you can afford to travel there, I am pretty sure you can afford a few extra dollars for tips) Grounds: You feel like you are living in a tropical rainforest. The staff is always sweeping the paths free of leaves and litter. There is a lot of local wildlife running around including Agoutis, Iguanas, various birds, and even a Coati. Also a female cat with the smallest black/white kitten I have ever seen. Plenty of shade to keep away the hot sun, but also very humid under the canopy\u2026 you will notice the difference. 10/10 rating. Overall, we had an excellent stay at the Reef and our friend is already talking about a return trip next year. It rained a few days we were there (didn\u2019t realize there was a tropical storm lurking offshore), but even then, everyone took it in stride and we never heard anyone complain. As we learned last year, rain showers are an everyday occurrence here, but seldom last more than 10-15 minutes. Pack a poncho or an umbrella if you feel you might melt\u2026 no one can control the weather. A few words of caution \u2013 be careful walking around on the wooden walkways and the restaurants\u2026 they tend to be a little slick after a rain and we saw a few people slip. I read a lot of negative reviews on here, but after a week at the Reef, I can\u2019t say that I experienced anything that would make me give this place less than 5 stars. Aside from a few \u201cholier than thou\u201d families, we felt that most everyone shared the same views as us.

We also had no problem with noise. It could have been our location, but only one incident when someone banged on a door at 1 AM. Other than that we heard no one. Pools/ lounging/ bars-- We had no problem getting a spot for either chairs or the larger beds, but we were early risers. I did see one family who always had towels out for the same spot (even by 6:30 AM). Service was fine at swim up bar. Of course we received better attention when tipping. I didn't feel the demand to tip; it was just something you may want to do if want extra attention and promptness. There is no service to any of the chairs, pool, or beach area. I have been at other resorts where they do have that service, but they do not do that here. There is a shaded dry entrance to swim up bar. You don't have to get in the water for the other side. Activities- Pretty disappointed in this area. Shows are not their main draw here. One night we went up and they had a private party in the room, so that was out. Another night, they decided to show the USA vs. Mexico soccer match. Understandably a huge draw for Mexico, but we didn't really care for it. For entertainment, room was smaller than what I have seen at other resorts. Although we saw many families at this resort, they did not cater to them. Great Parnassus in Cancun entertained and involved kids in activities, but not the case here. My kids did play volleyball and other games, but did not have the sense of importance played on involvement. Can be seen as a positive or neg. depending on how much you and family want to get involved. On one day we walked down to Playa del Carmen shops. It was about a 15- 20 minute walk on the beach. Once there, you will see a Senior Frogs and then a market of stores for souveniers. (It is hte port for Cozumel). Had a great time looking around. On the other hand, I really noticed the lack of things to do when it rained for two days and we really could go nowhere. The lobby is the only enclosed area to go, so we stayed in our room for one of those days, and then second day the kids swam in the rain and we just gave in to it as well. Overall, the kids were pretty bored. There was one or two staff members for activities and they had a laissez faire attitude. Again, it is what you want for your family. I wish there had been more. Excursions- We puchased a snorkeling trip. Approx. 1 hour of snorkle time. I had read about other packages prior to leaving and almost pre-purchased one but glad I didn't. My advice would be to wait until you get there to see what you and your family would like to do. We paid $106 for the 4 of us and it was a great experience! It felt as if we were swimming in a huge aquarium. Water was clear and shallow, and we enjoyed the boat trip out there (approx. 20 min. to get out to the reef). Food- Not a lot of choices, but food was good. I have experienced better and worse. I know that is not so helpful, but food was pretty average. Kids loved the steak restaurant. We also liked the Italian rest. too. Plenty of food given to you and it was delicious. Kids also like the snack area during lunch. Easy and quick. Ice cream area was closed for renovation. :( Last bit of advice--After arriving at the airport,walk straight outside to your transportation. On our first trip to Mexico, I stopped and listened to those trying to \"help\" us save money on excursions. They show you a map and it seems as if they are helping you show you around. Don't fall for it. It comes with a price to go to another resort for hours and check them out. On this trip, I fell for it again, but didn't give them the time to get into the explanation. We stopped him in the middle of his speech and walked out to meet our driver. Overall, we enjoyed our stay. You can decide what little to do or more to do. I think if you want to do more, you may have to pay for excursions. If you want to relax, swim, or walk on the beach then this is your place. The beach is absolutely beautiful. We will continue to travel to different locations.

We were all very excited, it was our first trip (mine and my boyfriend), the couple we were with had been to Playa many times, but not this resort. We wanted something small, accesible to town, and with plenty to do. It is very charming and clean, all of the staff was very friendly. A few things we had to ask for, and only knew about them because of the research I had done. When we checked in they did not let us know about the amenities offered, and there is no literature in the room. We paid an extra $15 per day for \"premium alcohol\" bracelets. We made sure this included Crown royal. Only 3 of the 4 of us wanted this, but they forced us to get 4 saying if 1 person in the room has it, all have too... there is also pottery painting by the towel pick up near the pool, but you have to pay for the pottery, but this was one of my most enjoyable times! We were taken to our clean room, it was perfect and had everything we needed, no complaints other than a not incredibly comfortable bed, but a large selection of pillows, and the noise outside of the room is quite loud. We were on the first floor and our friends were on the 3rd. We immediatly walked around to view the facility, very nice pools, lovely beach, a very short distance to everything. The ice cream bar is not open. Not while we were there anyway. Saw some iguanas and those rat looking things everywhere, very fun to watch. They were having drinks on the middle area near the waterfall, you had to charge the drinks to your room even though we had a premium bracelet. With our premium bracelt we were also able to get canned beer, so we took some back to the room. We had to sign for that and premium liquor each time. Note: they ran out of Crown royal after about 5 drinks. Not nice. we did have absolut however, and bout redbull in the gift store to mix with. We had dinner at the buffet, good choices, some a little sketchy, but no terrible complaints. Staff is nice and helpful, nice view. We then went to the rooftop bar, not many people (friday night), and to the entertainment show they provide, it felt VERY cheesy, maybe if I hadn't been so tired from flying and had a little bit more to drink it would have been better. Breakfast buffet, again, many many choices, fruit and juices were wonderful. We hung out by the pool and beach all day, but started to notice a LOT of people in the pool in the afternoon, lots of families, seemed like they were local.... come to find out from another couple, the resort apparently let's locals in for $40 a day!!! We were appaled at this point. It would have been more to ourselves and MUCH more relaxing if it was NOt open to the public. I was very upset. FElt like it wasnt a resort any longer. We had dinner in the resteraunt that night (not the italian one), it was very nice, the waiter was delightful, could speak 4 languages, we tipped him well. have to pay extra for premium meals... Again spent the night in the rooftop bar, playing the broken foosball table... ate a late night snack by the pool. Quesadillas or tacos. Tacos were no bueno. The hut during the day by the pool serves hotdogs, burgers, nachos, pizza (that has obviously been sitting out for a while) and fries. I ate about 15 hotdogs while i was there.. oops. One night we paid the guy $10 to make me a hotdog bc i didn't want a quesadilla... The italian resteraunt was ok, fine dining, but not wonderful. You have to pay extra for Filet Mingon and other fish choices... this is NOT an entirely all inclusive place. We would prefer more activities.... We will go to a larger resort next time that is truely and all inclusive, and that is more customer oriented. We went to town twice, once we alked and it poured rain, but that was fun, the 2nd time we took a cab and went to Senor Frogs for the night, had a BLAST! The maid service is spectacular, our rooms were SO clean and organized when we got home. A gal was SUPER wasted by the pool infront of her children one day, but security was present and escorted her out, she was very innapropriate. The bartenders at the pool are great, and so is the man in the evenings in the lobby. We mingled with the entertainment staff quite a bit, became friends with them actually. When we kayaked one morning very early, they helped us get them in the water. We walked for miles down the beach, apparently you can walk around topless bc we saw quite a bit of that on our walks!!

It is not big, which is what we like. It is very comfortable. The rooms were very nice. They were large and very clean. The bathroom was spacious too. The shower had good water pressure and was very relaxing. The restaurants are all good. If you go to one of the specialty places be prepared to pay from 10-17.00 for certain steaks. The wine list is very good in both places. The buffet is also good. Make sure you feed the adorable and very polite kitties that come by. There is a little black and white one with a baby that is just precious. Also enjoy the other native animals roaming around. They are very peaceful and will take bread or fruit from your hands. The pool is nice and the beach is the largest we have ever seen. It is clean and there are plenty of chairs and umbrellas. The pool bar pool must be visited. Check out Jesus, the bartender there. He is a doll and very good at what he does. We also had a young man named Jonathan help us at check in and he told us about all the hotel had to offer as we checked in. The ocean is so nice and warm. We loved it. At the bar try a Dirty Monkey, very good and the tequla is not bad either. We had a wonderful vacation with my brother and his wife. We were talking about going back next year before we even left. Oh, the place is also filled with gorgeous vegetation. There are palms and flowers every where. Loved every moment of our vacation.

We have kids ages 4 and 7 and went with another family kids ages 5, 13, 17. The reef is actually a very nice hotel, beautiful beach, great pool/s, the food is good....and no we did NOT get any food poisoning. For breakfast there were omelttes, waffles, pancakes, sausage, hash brown, cereal, fruit, yogurts, crepes, chilaquiles, sometimes tamales, and a lot of other items. The lunch buffet had a great variety too, there are many desserts at the buffet for lunch and dinner, there was the snack bar by the pool that also served hamburgers, hot dogs, pizza, chicken wings (awesome), night snack served tacos my favorite were the steak tacos with flour tortillas with hot sauce. Drinks were great we usually had a Paloma--tequila with lime and sprite also had Miami Vice and Pina Colada and Margaritas all were great. The ice cream bar is ongoing renovation but they have ice cream available by the snack bar. The walk to 5 Ave. is about 10-15 minutes from the hotel and it's pretty enjoyable....there are some ruins on the way (small ones, but we had great pictures of them). The beds were not as hard as some people have been writing about (and I am used to pillowtop). I would say that my only minor complaint would be that you can hear people go up/down the stairs outside your room or talking-(it wasn't too often though). The water temperature in the ocean must be like 75 or 80 degrees it was amazing. It did rain a few times when we were there but the rain showers did not last very long-maybe 10 minutes and then the sun comes out although on our way back to the airport in cancun it did rain for a few hours and our flight got delayed (but that was 1 day out of 6). We also went to both the Italian Restaurant and the Steakhouse....The chicken florentine was great at the Italian restaurant and the Arrachera (steak) was excellent at the steakhouse. There is a bar by the Theatre (upstairs) and they have 2 pool tables and a foosball table. We only saw one show (the Michael Jackson show) it was enjoyable (but make sure they tell you the exact time the show starts because it started an hour after they had said it would). There was a dinner/mariachi show by the beach one night but it's an extra cost (it seemed like a lot of fun) we did not pay the extra cost so we kind of watched it from far away. I would say that it is worth it if you don't have kids with you--it seemed like lots of fun.

Please bear with me, it might be long! The grounds: Very well-manicured hotel grounds, with a neat cenote and 'jungle' in the middle. Nice beach, and the pool is ok, though we found it annoying to be trying to cool off with a drink in hand while kids jumped and splashed in the water RIGHT next to us. The room: We had a standard room with a king bed in the 700-building. It was adequate, but nothing to write home about. Our air conditioning worked VERY well, which was good. We found the room to be incredibly noisy, and the walls are paper-thin. We could hear every single door opening, shower running, and people talking. Quite annoying, but we just kept our A/C on all the time to try to drown it out. We did also appreciate the HBO movie channels on our flatscreen tv in our room, too, which was nice to watch on the days we got rained out and hung out in our room. The food: Politely put, the food was not good. Borderline terrible in many cases, actually. We ate at the grill the first night we were there, and were very put off by the fact that the \"better\" steak meals were an extra charge of $10-$17 USD. We both ate the BBQ chicken with ceasar salad and it was fantastic, but I was still unimpressed that not everything was \"all-inclusive\" like we thought it should be. The second night we ate at the Italian restaurant with a few friends. Everyone but myself had pasta, and I ordered the chicken and spinach, as well as had some caprese salad from the salad bar. My chicken was really gross. The spinach in it was dry and crunchy, and the lumpy white sauce on top was not appetizing. The entree pasta was not cooked enough, and there was no meat (chicken, etc) in it. We also found the portions in the Italian restaurant to be quite small. ALSO, within 20 minutes of finishing our meal, I was VIOLENTLY ill and threw up so hard that I broke major blood vessels in both my eyes. It lasted all night, and I felt horrible all the next day. No one else who ate with us got sick, so I am thinking it was the chicken or the salad I had, but I was quite put off that I got that ill from presumably poorly-cooked/handled food. We did not return to the Italian restaurant after that. The buffet in the morning is all right. I had an omelet every day, and the lady working at that station does a great job. I found most things to be quite heavy/greasy, though, and not much variety from day to day. Some items in the buffet were ok, but none of it went together. So most meals there were not cohesive or as good as they could be. There is no room service here, and no beach drink waiter service, which we didn't realize until we arrived. It is quite a hike from the beach to the nearest bar or snack bar, so keep that in mind when choosing a lounge chair for the day. The snack bar is sub-par. The burgers are strange-tasting and VERY greasy. I was too scared to try a cold cut meat sandwich after my food poisoning incident, so I mainly stuck with fries from the snack bar during the day. The ice cream parlour was also not open the whole time we were there. If you decide to book with this resort, PLAN ON EATING IN PLAYA DEL CARMEN at least a few times. We were only there for one week, and we ate 3 of our meals in town, as we were SO bored of the same stuff everyday. Also, make sure you bring a lot of Immodium, as your stomach will likely be sick from the heavy and greasy food. The drinks: We were expecting to get bottles of beer, but were met with chea-tasting draft beer instead. The generic mexican liquor they use is awful, but after a few drinks, it's all the same. If you drink at Papos bar, ask for liquor like Smirnoff vodka or Appleton's rum--both aren't top shelf, but are MUCH better than what you'd normally get. A little lime in your drink also helps take the bite out a bit. The staff: The service and staff was absolutely amazing. We hung out at Papos bar (above the lobby) in the evenings, and Eric there is awesome. A few dollars in tips goes a long way in always getting good service. In fact, our favorite drinks were always ready for us within minutes of walking in. When we ate in the grill restaurant, the wait staff was very attentive and friendly. The buffet dining room staff were good at clearing all the dirty plates in a timely manner, and always stopping by to ask what we wanted to drink. All in all, we had an ok time. We were definitely ready to come home, though. The nice grounds and awesome service didn't make up for the awful food, in my opinion. We won't be returning, and we would not recommend this resort to our family and friends.", "Date": "June 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brighton Michigan", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay in Mexico...Playcar is THE BEST\u201d", "Author": "CCENZ", "ReviewID": "UR114644111", "Content": "I am a seasoned All-Inclusive Carribean traveler.

We were gone all day the first few days so we were only there at night. The first thing that we noticed was that the food at the buffet was not very good. They really need a better cook. The second thing that we noticed was that the servers were very nice. But if you did not tip them everytime you ate, they remembered you and would not be as helpful and friendly the next time you came in. One night the buffet was closed from 5:00pm to 7:00 pm. Very confusing! Stay away from the snack bar. You would be better off at McDonalds in Playa del Carmen. Here is what really ticked me off. They allow local vendors to come in and set up their little stands inside the resort every day. They are strategically placed so that you cannot get to the beach, buffet, bar or snack bar without passing all of them. When you pass, they offer to sell you silver and cigars at the best prices. They are like vultures trying to squeeze every last penny out of you. I truly feel that you should be safe from their marketing practices in your resort. Here you are not. If you want to use their internet, you must go to the lobby and pay cash of $12.00 US daily. If you get sunburned and need Aloe, go to the convenience store and you can pay a hefty price of $13 USD for a small bottle of Aloe. Just another example of the squeeze that they put on us the american tourist. But what prompted me to write this review is this incident. My oldest son went into the bathroom and slipped in some wet substance on the floor. It looked like urine to me. When he fell, he hit his head on a glass door and split his head open. They were very nice and offered to call for a doctor but I examined my son and determined that he did not need medical care or stitches. A bandage sufficed. So we went along through the week enjoying our stay. But when we went to check out we got a little surprise. They charged us a whopping $350 US for the glass door. I was floored. I didnt know how to respond but as soon as I gathered my wits, I told them no! I would not pay for this. That is ridiculous. Their response was that they were calling the police and that we would be detained and miss our flight home. Can you believe this? It really happened.

I am NOT a picky person, so here is the real deal review. WHAT I LIKED: THE BEACH - What can I say, but this is the absolutely best beach in Playa. All sand, no rocks, blue water, gentle slope. Very large wide beach. THE ROOMS - Very nice rooms, large, cozy, beds are not too hard as some describe. In fact I realized I slept better on these beds, than my own at home. They are kept clean. Just be sure you get one with one of the new \"Trane\" air conditioners. Ours was on the blink when we were there and after we complained, they replaced it with a brand new Trane one, while we were out on the beach. They seem to be replacing them as they go. As far as complaints on noise. The doors ARE NOT louvered as some suggested. They are faux louvers and you can hear people next to you slam their doors, but it is not as bad as people have said on these reviews. Nice balcony's too. THE GROUNDS - Wow, very cool jungle small setting. VERY well manicured with cool cenote waterfall in the front and middle. I also liked the fact that it was small and easy to get around. I like the building arrangements. THE BARTENDERS - Worked their tails off and made great drinks. Just tip em every now and then. THE SPECIALTY RESTAURANTS - These are good. The Italian is better food and better service. The grill is good but most things on the menu are $ upgrade items. If you don't want to pay, there are only three entree choices. We caught a Wahoo fish and they grilled it for us and it was great. The grill service was kinda slow though. WHAT I DID NOT LIKE OR MEDIOCRE: EXTRA CHARGES - you would think that since you are paying for all-inclusive that some things would come with it. Had to pay extra for the room safe. Extra for coffee in the lobby. The restauraunt coffee is free. There is extra charge for premium liquor. But what was the worst is that they actually charged for one of the shows. It was a mexican beach party and they wanted $20 per person!! Come on, those should be included. AIR CONDITIONING IN THE LOBBY - They keep it closed and don't turn on the AC until 8am. Why is this? We had to wait before then and I sat there and sweat BIG TIME. I don't get this one. THE SHOWS - absolutely terrible. The staff worked hard but sorry they just don't measure up to other resort shows. I am sure that is budget related. The only one that I got excited about was the mexican beach party, but they wanted to charge and I am cheap. UMBRELLAS - There seem to be plenty of them on the beach, but why not put Palapa's out on the beach, they are much nicer, mexican authentic, and provide more shade. They are only small enough to shade 2 people each, but they work. Don't worry you will find shade. SAILBOATS - there was only 1 working one and it was so beat up, I could not sail it for long. You are just asking to be stranded on one of those and I am an experienced catamaran sailer. THE FOOD - I thought the dinner buffet was just so so. I only ate there twice for dinner. The first time, it was absolutely terrible. The last time it was just ok. The deserts totally suck on the buffet. There seems to be fairly good variety. The breakfast and lunch buffets were good though. I liked the snack bar, buffalo wings. THE POOLS - very small swim up bar pool and is too crowded. It was also about 5 degrees warmer than the other pool and I can only guess why. The other pool was larger and not as crowded as it is the activity pool and not much activity was going on. I actually used that one since I could hardly get a swim up bar seat and that pools \"warmth\" grossed me out. All in all this is a very nice resort and I would go back, we had a great time and enjoyed the staff. I would recommend it, but very picky food buffet eaters might want to choose something else.

We traveled with 25 people for a friend\u2019s wedding. Upon arriving the grounds are beautiful and the staff was very nice but busy. It took over 1 hour for our luggage to be delivered to our room. Rooms: We were a little disappointed in the room. The rooms are a little small and very outdated. The beds are very hard, bathroom has no ventilation and the walls are paper thin. We could hear all of our neighbor\u2019s conversations, babies crying and people walking up and down the stairs ALL night long. Some rooms in our unit must have been under renovation because construction started at 8:00 am most mornings and lasted throughout the day. We had to be up and out of the room earlier than we wanted. The maid service did an excellent job at cleaning our room but would only leave two towels and washcloths every day when three of us were in the room. The mirror in the bathroom always had water stains down it so there must have been a leak from the unit above us. Forget using the refrigerator, it was never cold. Staff: Jesus was great at the pool bar but we gave him a large tip right away and tipped him throughout our 7 day stay. I didn\u2019t catch the other gentleman\u2019s name at the pool bar but didn\u2019t want to. He was VERY rude and wouldn\u2019t even stir our mixed drinks after making them (bloody mary\u2019s). We watched him with other customers and he treated them the same. The entertainment staff was very friendly. Allejandro, Jonathon and Daniel did a great job. They were constantly keeping us entertained and would call out to us from a distance just to wave. The dive shop staff was excellent. Food: The breakfast buffet was okay but we were very tired of it by the end of our stay. We never ate at the lunch buffet and only ate at the dinner buffet the first night of our stay. We were pleased with the grill and Italian restaurant. All 25 people in our party were very pleased with the snack bar after a long day of playing but they ran out of food often and the ice cream station was rarely open, when it was open it was a bit dirty. Alcohol: Upon making reservations we upgraded to premium bracelets for the two adults in our family. Upon check-in we were given and charged for (3) premium bracelets. I told them we had one minor in our room, they switched the bracelet. I tried explaining the difference in the cost but he could not understand me. I figured I would correct it at check-out but he also said he could not understand. They never gave me credit for the difference in the cost. The alcohol was VERY watered down. Although we had premium bracelets we were served the same alcohol as EVERYBODY else. Pools & Beach: The beach is beautiful and plenty of chairs and umbrellas for everyone. There is no drink service on beach so it\u2019s a small hike to the nearest bar. The pools are well maintained and very clean. There is no entertainment at the pool, no music unless you brought your own, which we did. Overall: You get what you pay for and nothing else. I was a bit confused as to why the bars were only open at certain times for alcohol only but open at all times for soft drinks, especially the lobby bar, it should be open all day for whatever beverages one wants with customers checking in and departing. I must reiterate that the staff was extremely pleasant besides the one gentleman working the pool bar. I would also like if someone would clarify the premium upgraded bracelets that is paid for in the beginning for 3 guest when only 2 guest were adults, no credit was given.", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cYou get what you pay for\u201d", "Author": "KillerCoconut", "ReviewID": "UR112794862", "Content": "Let me start with the good. The beach was quiet and beautiful! Always enough chairs and beds to go around. The staff at the pool bar (specifically Jesus and Marco) were attentive, social & fun. The two formal restaurants (Terraza Grill and Botticelli) had amazing food and great service. Also, skip the buffett for lunch and hit the snack bar by the pool which had your basic finger foods like hamburgers, nachos and deli sandwiches. Overall the resort is in a great location and short walk to Playa with small ruins on the way. Now for the not so great: Rooms: While the room size was okay for us, the walls might as well have been made of paper. It's so noisy with doors slamming and people walking up and down the stairs. The buildings are open so there are 3 floors with 4 rooms on each. Every night we were woken up by our neighbors because it sounded as though they were in our room. Closing the closet door helped minimally so we left the tv on in an attempt to block out the noise. Also, mold in the room and moisture issues due to no fan in the bathroom. On our second to last day our air conditioner stopped working as well. We heard from others that their beds were hard but we had no problem (had a King with pillow top). Unfortunately though, our balcony faced the back of the property (facing the back of another resort) where the workers walked (talked and pushed noisy carts) and were working on digging a drainage ditch the entire length of our stay. Food: The buffett was okay but we were tired of it by the time we left. Breakfast was by far the best. Resort: While it was nice that the resort was smaller so you could walk to whatever you needed, there was only 2 pools and NO entertainment options. Minimal music at the pool and during dinner. Also, there's no drink service on the beach so it did get tiring walking back and forth to the pool bar for drinks. The ice cream parlor was never open either which was a bummer but they did have options in the snack bar. There is no room service and be careful with the fridge. You have free pop one time then you pay. You can get water from anywhere in the resort so no worries there. Staff: Once again Jesus and Marco were great at the pool bar. Hector the bellboy was also very friendly and helpful. There were a few hostesses at the resort that were rude but the servers were always great. Overall, if you need anything extra they won't do it. Be careful of the extra charges they have on some drink and food items too. If you are looking for an adult-like resort this is not it. I think kids stay free and there are mostly families at this resort.

We have always stayed at either the Iberostar Resorts or Dreams Resorts. Because this was our first time traveling with our baby, we chose a resort within walking distance to town with a stroller and since we weren't sure how the baby was going to act in the warm weather, we didn't want to spend too much money (in case we had to stay in our room most of the time.) Thankfully, we didn't! Because we have so much experience with other resorts in the Playa area, I am going to be as honest as possible. My husband and I are NOT picky people. We just wanted a nice room, good food, and friendly staff. Transfers: We always use USA transfers. They are fantastic (great prices, great service, and even had a baby seat for us waiting in the van.) Arrival at the Reef: There was no one to greet us upon arrival. When we approached the front desk, we were not greeted with a smile but rather rushed us through as fast as they could. After about 10 minutes, a bell boy finally came to help us with our luggage. Room: The rooms aren't too bad, just very outdated. The maid service did a great job cleaning each day. However, we have never heard as much noise outside the room as we did in this resort. It's as if all the windows and doors were wide open. VERY LOUD each night makes for a difficult nights sleep. Also, if you want to use the safe, be prepared to pay for it. Beach area: Beautiful! Pool area: clean and never had any difficulty finding a spot under an umbrella, which was great for the baby. Wait staff and bartenders: VERY disappointed. They were often rude or wouldn't help us at all. This was the first time in 10 years my husband and I didn't tip once. Food: Let me begin by saying I am not a picky eater but I was quite disappointed. The breakfast was by far the best meal they offer. The lunch buffet/snack bar is the same each day and my husband and I were taken aback at how some menu items at the dinner restaurants cost extra money! If you didn't want to spend the extra money, you were only given 3 entree items to choose from. Location: This was the main reason why we picked this resort. It's a 10 minute walk to town or just a few minute walk to the shops in Playacar. Perfect location. Overall: As my husband said \"you get what you pay for.\" There is no room service or poolside/beach wait staff. The food was below average but what turned us off the most was the lack of friendly service whether at the lobby, bar, or in the restaurants. I was also quite surprised about the lack of security within and outside the resort. I never felt unsafe but we were always used to security checking our bands when we leave and return to the resort. This never happened (anyone could walk in the resort and no one would stop them). We also never saw security walking around within the resort which we thought was strange. We were also turned off to see the resort Entertainment Crew constantly flirting with guests including myself. This was also the first time in which we could \"upgrade\" our band for premium alcohol. Where we stayed before is a TRUE all inclusive: the safe, coffee makers, all menu entrees, and premium alcohol is included. For those of you that have only been to the Reef, I would HIGHLY suggest trying a different all inclusive within Playa and then updating your review of this resort. We are used to and expect the beautiful resorts with the most outstanding staff and service. We didn't receive that here. We will be returning back to the Iberostar or Dreams resorts.", "Date": "June 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Beach and Location, Decent Resort\u201d", "Author": "amvm99", "ReviewID": "UR111997699", "Content": "I am going to try and be as fair as possible with my review. The Reef Playacar is located in a beautiful location in Playacar. The beach was amazing and it is just a short walk to town either along the beach or via the street. The area seems very safe, but at night there is not too much light on the street or on the beach. A cheap cab is your best option late at night. The resort grounds are very nice and the staff tries hard to keep everything clean. The rooms are nothing to write home about. They are your basic standard rooms. The first room we had required us to move due to a leaking air conditioner and a clogged sink and bathtub. The 2nd room that we had to be moved to was fine. They only stock the mini fridge once with beer. If you drink any more than what is in the fridge your first day then you are charged for it. Water and soda is unlimited I believe. The food is decent. Again nothing to write home about and it does get pretty redundant after a while so while we paid for an all-inclusive resort we opted to go out for meals once in a while. The drinks at this resort are terrible. They are very cheaply made. Tons of ice and very little flavor or alcohol. They don't always have all the ingredients either. Sometimes there were no bananas for a dirty banana or at times there would be no curacao for a blue Hawaiian. You get what you pay for in the food and drinks category at this resort. The restaurants are pretty good. The steakhouse was better than the Italian restaurant and you do not need reservations which is nice. These places are pretty empty. I cannot comment on the nightly entertainment because we never went to see a show and on the last night when we attempted to, it was casino night at the bar instead. We did not stay for that either. It just seemed cheesy. We did however head to town every night and that was really fun. There are so many good restaurants and bars to try out that it seemed silly to stay at an all-inclusive at times, but we are still debating that. Another point that I should mention is that this place is a bit of a wedding factory. Almost every day/night there was a small wedding going on. They must be an affordable option for a destination wedding and the staff seems to try hard to make it a nice ceremony for the bride and groom. They certainly have a nice beach for it. With the weddings comes big groups of families and friends too. There were not many children at this resort at all, but that could have just been the week that I was there so I cannot comment too much on that. I don't think I would stay here again. The place is nice, but I think I would rather either spend a little more for a nicer all inclusive or skip the all-inclusive all together and take advantage of the great food and drinks in town.

This is approximately my 5th time in Playa del Carmen and I have traveled significantly for both work and pleasure in Mexico, but this was the 1st resort style trip with my daughter 4, my wife and my in-laws (in their early 80's) 1st off... This is not a Mega-Resort so don't expect a ton of \"fancy\"restaurant choices, a buffet table as far as the eye can see, hairy back contests or spring-breakers. But here's where this resort really excels. This is a multinational resort: Grade = A+ Everyone (employees) at the resort speaks English to some degree, but they also speak: Portuguese,French, German, Italian, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, and some even speak a but of Canadian, Ehe... Americans are not the biggest consumer... This is something I love.... I was ecstatic that daughter made friends that spoke a language other than English, and she had fun playing with them for a week, and by default my wife and I tried out our high-school level Spanish on her friend's parents.... that was a bit rough but a fun time regardless... The Food: Grade = B+ The breakfast and lunch buffets are very good. The menu is repetitive only in major categories. At lunch, for example, there is always Mexican food area (not tex-mex), a meat/fish area, a pasta area and a desert area. We were always able to find a very tasty meal... but there were some people complaining that they didn't know what some of the food was or it looked funny... just the typical buffet complaints... There are also 2 formal restaurants, a steak house and an Italian Restaurant both were very good and willing to work with our special requests. These restaurants also offer, at additional cost ($10 USD), upgraded meals; we tried them, the regular meals were better in our opinion... Just remember its a multinational resort they cant really please just one segment of their clientele base, the food is meant to be agreeable to people of all different nationalities The General Decor: Grade = B+ I would put this place in the \"boutique hotel\" category. There is a jungle/Swiss Family Robinson theme through the entrance and middle of the resort, complete with waterfall and natural cenote/underground fresh water river and mosquitoes (bring insect repellant) and a traditional beach style resort theme as you move closer to the ocean and the pools. the paths between the buildings are not flat so if you are opposed to climbing small hills some of the pathways in the cenote section of the resort may put you off a bit and you may want to ask for a room closer to the pools (but be aware that the rooms near the pools are a bit louder due to the pool activities) The Rooms: Grade = B Overall just ok. The rooms are big , The AC works great, The bathrooms are decent size, the balcony is perfect for smoking cigars. But there is some wear and tear on the rooms, there was a bit of minor grout mold in our shower and some water glass stains on the furniture.... it was nothing that would put me off... but if you're looking for \"Mc-Mansion perfect\" maybe this is not the place for you. The Pools and Beach: Grade = A - There are 2 pools, one has a swim up bar and a kiddie area, the overall pool size would be a kidney bean sized high school pool. The other pool is about 2x the size of the first and is adjacent the main restaurant and overlooks the ocean. I played a lot of volleyball and did plenty of wading in this pool with the family. Now around each pool there are both lounge chairs and beds with a shade net... there were plenty of spots... no need to hurry out to save a spot unless you want the same spot every day... but by second pool there is also a sandy area for kids to play in so we had a pool with a sandy surround to play in daily... great for my daughter and plenty of shade to keep the burns away.... The beach was fantastic as well, the water was warm, there are plenty of umbrellas, beach chairs, hammocks,=. one thing to note though the ocean drops off quickly so keep an eye on your kids. Other Activities : Grade = A I'm a huge fan of ocean sports, especially catamarans... and the ones at the Reef never seamed to be in use and the guys manning the equipment were always up for letting me go out... and there were kayaks and snorkel masks and boogie boards. To top the cake there is a fantastic PADI Dive Center on the resort \"The Reef Marina\", set up a free SCUBA demo... its a blast, and if you do make sure to ask for Bruno or Bert.. they are great and they can hook you up with your 1st dive after that through the PADI Discover SCUBA program...additionally the hotel provides water aerobics, Zumba, Yoga and sets up nightly trips to Coco Bongo and other hotspots for the good time seekers The Staff : Grade = A+ it seamed like their moto was \"Whatever, Whenever\"; Fantastic all around staff, accommodating, welcoming and hard working... just great... Make sure to look for Roberto in the main dining room... he's the sweaty guy waiting on the entire balcony...with a smile on his face.... Go Roberto! Go! Other notes: There's a new ploy in the city... watch out for shop keepers claiming to be the waiters or other staff from you hotel... they are not whomever they claim to be...they are planning on you not recognizing them and feeling bad in order to follow them into their shop... just be aware..", "Date": "May 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lynn, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cA little Slice of Heaven\u201d", "Author": "takemeaway53", "ReviewID": "UR109817127", "Content": "The Reef is a small resort with beautiful gardens and a great beach.

It also leaked a LOT - we had to leave a towel on the floor under the unit. I did notice that our friends rooms had updated air conditioner units, so I hope they plan to upgrade the one in room 112. No bug problems besides the last day - found a dead cockroach type in the bathroom and lots of ants. Housekeeping did a great job of keeping it clean otherwise. Bars: Jesus, Miguel, and Marco were great bartenders. Please consider bringing a few dollars to tip them each day if you plan on spending a lot of time at the pool bar or roof bar. Many drinks to choose from - Mojitos, Sex on the Beach, Bahama Mamas, Margaritas, Blue Hawaii, Tequila Sunrise. Our group would occasionally give them a dollar and they would make fun shots for our group to take. Also many times we would just ask for \"something fruity with vodka\" or \"something without coconut\" and would get a delicious drink. Food: Best food we found were the tacos at the snack bar. Wings from there were very tasty too. Buffet was good, breakfast the best - lunch and dinner were pretty similar always. The two sit down restaurants were great - Erick especially. Loved the Italian place. Two of the nights we went to those restaurants as a group they brought out shots for us. No reservations needed - and neither place was very busy any of the times we went up which was surprising! Staff in those places were awesome, fun sense of humor, lots of joking with us. Pools/Beach: Loved the swim up bar, lots of socializing there. Chairs were available around the pools even if you didn't get up early. Beach volleyball and soccer available, and they set up pool volleyball for us when we asked. Activities are listed on a sign by the activity pool, where you go to get beach towels. A note: if you check out a beach towel and do not return it same day, you have to return it to the lobby. We kept two all week, exchanging them at the towel station until the last day when we finally turned them in. Very safe, was able to leave towels/books/etc on our chairs to go get a drink without worrying about someone taking them. Staff: VERY courteous and friendly. All say hello as you pass. Rooftop bartenders were having tons of fun with everyone our last night. Quick service at the bars - you don't have to wait 30 minutes for a drink. Cleaning staff constantly working to clear leaves from paths and empty cups. Were not bothered about time shares, and vendors selling items were courteous and understood when you said no. Would have liked for Internet to be more readily available (was told it was $10/hour) as we wanted to watch a hockey playoff game, but we were fine otherwise. Overall: Excellent value for what you pay. We arrived in Cancun, got a shuttle to The Reef, and were on the beach within minutes upon arriving. Tons of drinks (other all inclusives can have a certain list you have to choose from), food always available, and a great place to relax!", "Date": "May 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cFantastic vacation - loved the Reef!\u201d", "Author": "KSEMR", "ReviewID": "UR108635122", "Content": "I have never written a review, but feel compelled now. After reading some horrible reviews, I was extremely nervous about my stay at the Reef for 6 days, 7 nights. I initially picked this hotel for the price and location and figured that even if it was sub-standard, it would still be a steal. I was more than pleasently surpised! I can't say enough about the staff - they are all so incredibly gracious and courteous. I was never bothered by anyone regarding a time share either. The buffett was great; plenty of choices for everyone. The steak restaurant was fantastic, too. The pools were nice and the beach was absolutely amazing. You do need to get up early if you'd like to reserve a bed, but it's well worth it. The rooms were clean (yes, the beds are hard) and served their purpose. I especially liked the balcony area. You will hear some noise outside of your room, but it didn't bother me, and it wasn't extreme. I've stayed at other all inclusives ( Hilton, etc) and felt like I was on a compound. Yes, the rooms may be nicer, but there is no personality or culture to those places. I've also found the food to be better here than other places, too. This is a laidback and fun resort. I especially liked that people of all ages were at the resort; it's not catered to a specific group. We are in our 30's and had a great time. It's not a party place, and I liked that aspect. There are plenty of choices for people who like to go out at night ( the bar is open until 3:00am and there are places downtown), but I would say this place if perfect for anyone late twenties and up ( with or without families). We liked it so much that we plan to return next year with our children. You can't beat this place for the value, location or staff!

This year we were traveling with his daughter,her husband and their 6 month old. We chose this resort because of the price, location, small size and the beach. We booked through Expedia - and I must say we will try not to fly U.S Airways again! CHECK IN: Was fine - the only complaint I have is the ridiculous price for WIFI and or use of the computers. I chose to pay the 35.00 for WIFI for the week as i brought my Ipod. I could only use it in the lobby even though I could pick up secured WIFI for the Reef down by the pool/beach. When I asked about logging on down there - they just said no - only at lobby. NOTE TO RESORT: Having access to WIFI by the pool/beach would be nice and convenient for paying customers :) - we also paid 25.00 for the safe key for the week. THE ROOMS: weren't fancy 5 star as expected. They were comfortable and clean. We had a bottom floor room 1411 - this was the perfect spot for us - near the pool and not facing the busy walkway. We didn't have too much trouble with noise, the shower worked (there may have been a few tiny ant like bugs in there - but hey we're in the tropics) the beds were comfortable - not too hard. the mattresses were not hard - they may have been recently upgraded??? They even have a pillow menu with different pillows on your bed. The flat screen was nice and we had enough channels for our liking. ROOM SERVICE: we made sure to tip our maid. $5.00 a day we never had any issues getting extra bottles of water from her, or beer. They have an ecological program and would rather you fill your water bottles up with filtered water at buffet. less waste - i don't blame them - people waste canned beer/water too much at resorts. BEACH/POOL: We never had any issue getting beach chairs or the loungers. We got up between 7-8am every morning and reserved them. The canopy loungers worked really well for the baby. It kept him shaded and provided some privacy.The beach was amazing - lots of it, the pools were great. It seemed adults go to the swim up bar pool and kids use the activities pool. FOOD: the food at the Riu resorts we stayed at was 10 times better. By mid week we got sick of the food. There wasn't enough variety for us. We weren't able to eat off the resort as much this trip , so relied on breakfast, lunch and dinner here. What we loved were the tamales,omelets,fresh juices and coffee, in the morning. Lunch and dinner we preferred more of the Mexican fare if they had it (tacos, taquitos,etc..) Some things were questionable and you wondered if they were using left overs. THE STAFF: Miguel was outstanding as our waiter. Always a smile - we tipped him well because he was sooo great. Dennis & Alfonso were great too :) Ice cream bar had great cookies, hand made ice cream and coffee during the day. BARS: Felix, Jesus were great bartenders. We loved our miami vices, pina coladas, mango tangos and mojitos. The snack bar was handy if you wanted a quick bite. NOTE: you had to pay for wine and specialty coffees??????? ENTERTAINMENT: We never experienced the entertainment nor did we participate with the activities. We were there just to relax with family. They put on a Mexican themed buffet and show on the beach one night but you had to reserve for it and be there by 7PM and pay 10.00 a piece for it!!!! Also they announce these events at the pool during the day - so if you don't hear it - you miss out (no bulletin board around to advise of events at the resort) all in all - I knew booking this resort we would have a great priced vacation. I didn't expect 5 star rooms, service, or food. I wouldn't pay money for an upgrade - if that is what you are looking for then you should have booked the palace next door. This place was friendly, quiet, and laid back. We were never hassled by front desk, we never had any issues with our rooms, or maids. No \"do not disturb signs\" so if you are in the room make sure to lock door on inside and latch so they don't pop in :) would we go back? probably not and that is only because after trying this resort and the Occidental last year I would rather go back to a Riu.

When looking for a place to stay I read SOOO many reviews of different places, and to be honest, I was a little worried at some of the comments on The Reef. However, price won over concern and we booked. I am so glad we did. Let me start at the beginning. When we arrived we immediately handed over $210 cash for an upgraded \"Superior Room.\" We were they taken to our room in building two, second floor. Nice location, but I realized that my $210 was a mistake. The room was small yet fine, but I was hoping for an upgraded flat screen TV that I had read about in reviews (no, we don't watch at home at all, but the kids do like it on vaca), a fridge that would be restocked everyday, fluffy robes, a coffee maker, etc. I realized that they put a 4 cup coffee maker and two laughably small thin robes in the room and that is what I paid for. Our bellhop told us that there must be some confusion because our fridge was not to be refilled, as this was a \"standard room.\" After a phone call to the front desk and a bit of confusion, we were told we'd be moved to a room in building 14 the next day and I should be at the desk by 9am. It was a little tough not letting the kids unpack all the way and set up their spots, but we managed. The next day was very mixed up. There was confusion about the new room at 9am and we were told to return to the desk at 11:30. Then 12:30, as the room was not yet ready. Then once more told to either return or to allow our bags to be moved when things were ready. This was a fine option, but was a bit inconvenient to have to stay close to 'home' on out first day until is was figured out. Somewhere around 2ish we found our things were moved. I was very pleased with the room. I could be wrong, but I think the square footage was a bit bigger, flat screen TV, fridge to be restocked daily, etc. Yup, smallish robes again, but really, who cares? The kids (ages 8 and 10) wore them well:) If you do the upgrade, you should know that they only put some soda cans, 2 water bottles, and 2 beers a day in your fridge. And if none have been removed, none are added. I only mention because I think we scored maybe a six pack of beer all week. Maybe it is just human behavior, but I would have liked to crack open a few beers in our room, but seeing that there was only two beers at a time, one for each of us, I felt like it needed to be coveted. lol. The rooms, as well as the entire place was very clean. The people were kind and warm. The grounds were absolutely beautiful. We loved the little critters that roamed the area. We also fell in love with the resident cats, stray I assume. My husband was caught off guard to have a stray cat hiding under our dinner table at first, but this became a much looked forward to part of our meal. The kids were thrilled, and I must admit, so was I , as it appeared the small black and white cat was expecting and I was happy to offer her some fish every now and then. The buffet was one of our favorite things. There were many choices and the variety changed each day, with a few favorites remaining a constant. My son enjoyed a fresh made omelet each morning (don't forget to tip the sweet lady there) and we enjoyed some more traditional mexican food. There was something for everyone. The fresh fruit was always wonderful. And the morning juice choices always made us smile. The coffee at the early morning continental breakfast? well... lets just say I'm glad we paid for the coffee maker in the room:) We tried the other two restaurants as well, and were pleased. The kids LOVED the snack bar and the freedom it gave them to munch when they wanted. I gotta say, it was pretty darned good. My daughter went to the ice cream bar about three times a day and loved the coconut ice cream. I agree with her. The drinks at the bars were pretty good. We were introduced to the Speedy Gonzales, which became a fast friend. Yum. And they make a great Mojito. The kids also loved the freedom of ordering banana daiquiris, made with 1/2 a banana each, which made me happy. The kids didn't love the kids club, but I really don't think they gave it much of a chance. The lady that ran it, I wish I could remember her name (Claudia maybe), was a lovely kind person and I trusted her completely. She was dedicated to keeping the kids busy and entertained in healthy ways and not letting them sit in front of video games all day. I really think my kids missed out on some fun stuff. Maybe next time. The adult activities were not well organized, but I'm sure the folks get tired to trying to motivate folks who would rather sit in the sun and drink. They did manage to recruit my husband into a volley ball game, which was nice for him. The pools were spotless and a great temp. The hot tub however, was the same temp as the pools. We very much wanted to grab some nice relaxing hot tub time, but it was just to cold. The beach was amazing. Windy the week we were there, but spectacular nonetheless. The beach chairs were fine, some broken, but we never had a hard time getting a few. The outdoor beds were heavenly and you did need to get out fairly early to mark one with a towel. Another thing we loved was the pottery hut on the beach. Our son was very serious about painting his piece and loved the way it looked the next day when it came back glazed. While there we took a few trips into town and a few excursions. The staff was helpful in giving info on transportation, where to get good deals on hammocks, and such. We were never approached about the dreaded time share we read so much about. The internet was spotty in the lobby, but they were always ready to help me reconnect, even though I knew I was becoming a pain in their collective butt. The gift shop was nice, but E-Gads! Over $7 usd for a small bag of chex mix? Oh well, it was daughters $ to spend. I also liked the on site Travel Agent and booked a trip through them. They were warm and very informative. At the end of our stay, we hated to leave. My daughter cried the whole time we packed and waited for a cab. Hector made her feel better by telling her when she was grown she could come back and he'd get her a job there. That was a sweet thing to say, and really helped:) So sum up this ridiculously long review- Well, we travel time to time and just last year stayed at a 5 star in Disney World. It was perfect in that it all ran 100% smoothly. The Reef was not 100% smooth, nor did we expect it to be. What it was was 100% human. Kind people who really tried and largely succeeded. Nature at its best. There were bumps, but the bumps disappeared in the humanity and willingness to please the folks who may be used to a bit more. And still offered pleasant surprises that we didn't expect. It was 100% comfortable, not stuffy or snobby how some places can be. For my family, it was a perfect experience and I hope to return very soon.", "Date": "May 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ashburn, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cGreat value, great location\u201d", "Author": "jeskea20", "ReviewID": "UR107118274", "Content": "my fiance and i stayed at the Reef Playacar from 25 Apr - 2 May. This was our 2nd stay in Playa del Carmen - last year we stayed next door at the Riu Palace. We chose this hotel primarily for the location and the price. We are both very down to earth and easy to please, so i knew that even though this wasn't a 5star resort, that we would be happy. here is a fairly comprehensive review: location: the reef is in a small neighborhood within about a 10 - 15 min walk from the center of town. it is right next to the Riu Palace and a couple of beach side condos/properties. accommodations: the rooms are separated into little apartment like complexes that line both sides of the main walkway that runs from the lobby to the beach. along this main walkway you have branches to the side that lead to the rooms, the ice cream parlor, a sitting area, the gym, pools, restaurant and then finally, the beach. its a very charming layout set in the midst of trees and a cenote and is easy to navigate. the rooms were great - we had a king size bed, a tv, mini fridge and a small patio. it was very clean, the fridge was stocked with soda and beer, there was bottled water which was replenished every day and a small coffee service. i saw previous reviewers complaining about bugs or ants in their room. i saw a couple - it was definitely never a problem and nothing to worry about. the bathroom was clean and we had no problems with leaks or anything like that. one thing that i thought was kind of weird - the shower head is low. im about 5'10 and i couldnt stand under it or it would be resting on the top of my head. i dont know if this is typical for all of the rooms. one huge oversight that i noticed was the fact that the hotel does not provide \"do not disturb\" door tags. the people next door to us had brought one with them and i wished we had done the same. the cleaning people and the guy who replenished the fridge were persistent about getting into the room. during an afternoon nap the maids knocked three times (each time we told them we didnt need anything...clean? no. towels? no. coffee? no. i felt like i was in tommy boy) and then they called our room three times in a row. if you like to take naps in the afternoon, want to sleep in, or don't want service to your room every day i would highly recommend bringing your own door tag. as far as the noise level goes...it is incredible. this has to be by far the worst hotel i have ever stayed at as far as noise goes. any little sound outside the door sounds like it is right in your room with you. several times i woke up because i thought my fiancee had gotten up and was shuffling around. the only times this really bothered us was when we slept in. if you are a light sleeper and want to sleep in past 7 or 8 am you need to bring ear plugs. food: we only ate at the chula vista buffet and the snack bar, so i cant speak to the other restaurants. the nice thing about the buffet is you can come at any time within their service frames. for breakfast i believe it was 7 - 10, lunch was 1230 - 3 and dinner was 630 - 10. the bad thing about this is that if you are not there right at the beginning, you might have to wait and you might have a dirty table. they do not change the table cloths and we are late eaters so i would say almost every single meal we ate was on a table with a spotted table cloth. i didn't really care but i think some people might. also one night we ended up waiting almost 30 minutes to get seated. i dont know if this is typical or not, but after that we made sure we showed up earlier. the food. well...theres a lot of it! theres plenty to choose from and lots of variety. we got sick of the food towards the end of our stay but i think if you eat at any buffet 2 - 3 Xs a day for a week straight you'll get sick of it. if you do - go eat at a restaurant in town a couple nights. thats what we did. the food at the snack bar was great (open 11 am - 2 am), but they transition their menu around 6 pm - and if you go at this time they are pretty much out of food. the drinks: i drank beer, water and vodka tonics. all three were great. the juice and mixers were basically cheap fake substitutions. if you dont mind sugary imitation drinks youll be fine. the pools/beach: the beach is perfect. like everyone else has said - if you are not up early all of the beds and umbrellas will be taken, but there were always free loungers. there are 2 pools, 1 near the buffet that had a basketball net and activities, and one with a swim up bar. they were both full of kids and after getting repeatedly splashed in the face by them and seeing a giant hair ball float by i never got in again. it didn't really matter though - i came to go to the beach and thats pretty much where we stayed. the gym: um it looked really nice! sweaty happy people pumping away at the machinery. i was a lazy bum, so i didnt actually USE it, but if you are more motivated than me i think youll be happy with it. the service: the cleaning people are tireless. they are constantly cleaning and the place is really spotless. i think the buffet is understaffed. the servers really tried, but if you dont feel like waiting 10 minutes to get a drink or a refill youll just need to get it yourself. my overall impression of this hotel is that i got exactly what i paid for and what i expected. i didnt pay a lot - so i didn't get a lot in return. the food is cheaper (you wont find lobster, shrimp or filet mignon on the buffet), the drinks are cheaper, the amenities are sparse and they are a little understaffed. on the plus side the hotel is incredibly clean, the rooms are great and the location is wonderful. if you are looking to be pampered this is absolutely not the place to go, but if you are fairly easy to please and can overlook some minor details you will enjoy your vacation.", "Date": "May 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAmazing holiday!\u201d", "Author": "LondonTraveller0181", "ReviewID": "UR106979373", "Content": "We arrived at the hotel just before midnight after a very long trip from the UK and were greeted by very friendly staff at the front desk.

The room was spacious - twin room with two double beds - and very clean. The air con was constantly on a very nice temperature which made it pleasant to return after a day outside in the hot sun. After reading other reviews on here, a lot of people seem unhappy with the beds. Some people prefer hard beds and some prefer soft beds, it's very much up to each individual person. I slept so well for the entire 10 nights we were thee and actually quite miss that bed! The food in the buffet restaurant was great and the service friendly. The grill restaurant has amazing steaks that must be had at least once! I wasn't too impressed with the Italian restaurant, we only ate there once and the fish i had was very dry and my friend found her food too salty. The pools are clean and have nice temperatures, although i think there should be a smoking ban in the swim up bar since we quite often found cigarette butts floating in the pool which wasn't very nice. The hotel is set in beautiful lush gardens which are very well kept and we found it really peaceful and relaxing strolling through the grounds. It's so beautiful in the evenings when it's lit up. The service in general in the hotel is super friendly and since it's not a very big hotel, the staff quickly recognize you and call you by name. We had great fun with the Animation team, an extra big shout out to the lovely Alejandro and Daniel for recommending us which clubs to go to and selling us wristbands. The night clubs in Playa del Carmen are amazing! The only complaint I have are about the towels you get at the pool. At no point are you told that each lost or unreturned towel will be charged at 35USD which is a crazy amount of money for one towel. Apparently this is in small print on the card you sign when you collect a towel but that should definitely be much clearer. You should be told by the front desk either when you check in or when you first collect your towel. Apart from that this is a fantastic hotel and great value for money. The staff all smile and say hello to you, from cleaners to chefs. The beach is beautiful and the location of the hotel is fantastic. It's within easy reach to Playa del Carmen, a 5 minute cab ride or a 15 minute walk on the beach. I will definitely be returning to The Reef and i have already recommended it to friends. Thank you so much for one of the best and most relaxing holidays i've ever had!

I have to admit that this was the cleanest, friendliest (staff) all inclusive we have been to. The employees were all fantastic, very polite and provided great service. The pools were sparkling clean, as were the grounds and room we stayed in. We stayed in a 1st floor room close to the pool and thought noise might be an issue but it wasn't; nor did we hear our \"neighbors\" above or next to us during our week stay. (We stayed in room 1014 April 13 - 19, not a holiday week.) The place is quaint, intimate and beautiful. This resort also had the best policies and access to sailboats, kayaks and boogie boards. No hassles regarding time restrictions or availability - it was a wonderful surprise! Finally! The activities staff did an OK job but I think they need to organize more beach and pool volleyball (basketball) per day as that seemed to be a bigger draw than other activities. Plus the teens like those activities. We didn't attend evening shows, opted to play pool instead and turn in early after a full day outside. My teenage son found a few other teens to hang out with during the week. We felt very comfortable letting them do their thing around the resort, it is a safe environment - not a huge \"party\" atmosphere, more laid back adults / families resort. The buffet was good, food not quite as warm as I would have liked or experienced elsewhere, but plenty of options and tasted good nonetheless. The steakhouse and Italian restaraunt were both great. The snack bar was fine, great for lunch (my son suggests allowing hamburgers and hotdogs even after 6:00 p.m.). Another nice surprise...the drinks were very good! Finally! Like I said previously, we may have found \"the one\" - a spot we could see ourselves returning to over and over - IF - they get new mattresses. (Less dense pillows would be nice as well.) The previous reviews stating the mattresses were as hard as a rock were, unfortunately, 100% accurate. I could barely sleep 3 hours before tossing and turning due to the pain associated with sleeping on such a hard bed. Out of desperation, I folded the soft comforters and stacked them on my side before putting freshly laundered beach towels on top as a makeshift pillow top (also to keep them protected and clean). Unfortunately it didn't help much and I left on the 7th day exhausted. I slept 11 hours when I got home. I would love to try this resort again if the price is right and IF they get new mattresses. If that happens I could see myself being their non-paid spokesperson - my family too!", "Date": "April 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Family Vacation Spot!!!\u201d", "Author": "md1027_11", "ReviewID": "UR104947200", "Content": "Just returned from The Reef with our 3 kids, found the resort excellent on all levels, clean, attentive and plenty of activities and opportunities for inactivity.

I am used to looking at resorts , and how these cater to ALL people. This resort was looked at from a personal standpoint. We usually travel as a couple with our daughter and son in law. We look for smaller, intimate resorts, where you meet and get to know the staff, and resorts must have balconies (for morning coffee), and a swimup bar, and great beach. This resort hit on all points. Any issues i had with this resort were minor and definately fixable. Lets start with.... Rooms - Rooms were a good size, not huge, but not tiny. Best to request a 2nd or 3rd floor unit, although we spend 2 nights on a ground floor unit. We were moved upon request, no questions asked. No hassle and great service form the front desk. Yes, the air conditioners are loud, but not enough to keep you awake at night. The rooms are clean and housekeeping is great, honest and personable. we left ipods out on the nightstand and actually i left my wallet out, and had no issues with security at all. The balconies are a good size for 2 people, great for relaxing and enjoying a coffee. POOLS - There are 2 pools. small but not tiny. the upper pool is the swim up bar and used for relaxing and enjoying the sun. The Lower pool is almost on the beach and is used for activities like water volleyball, the crazy games, STAFF_ Jesus at the swimup bar. Berst drinks . ask for the Miami Vice. Edgar upstairs above the lobby - ask for the Riviera Maya.. Animation Team is busy all day and all night. Say Hi to Chiquita and Nelson. great people. Finally, people who shoot down this resort should be locked in a hotel unit for a month. These are people who do not understand that resort vacations are about experiencing local life, customs and people. Nuff Said.

The hotel was composed of smaller buildings (3 levels, with 4 rooms on each level) which made sort of a diamond shape around a 'jungle' (that's what it looked like to us). The rooms with the 'garden' view had WAY more comfy chairs (with cushions) out on the balcony, than what we had (we had a very nice view of a tree and the next door hotel with whicker chairs and no cushions). Our bed was VERY uncomfortable (like putting a sheet over a slap of concrete). We could hear our neighbors so clearly through the walls/doors it was as if they were right in the room with us.

The buildings look authentic and are cheerful yellow and orange. The rooms are average in terms of amenities but very clean and we tipped $2 everyday for more towels. The size of the resort is a definite plus, because no matter where your room is you can arrive at the beach, pool, lobby, gym, or spa in 2-3 minutes.

Another positive to note is that the hotel is a short walk (15 min) to town from either the beach or the road. Food was below average in my opinion but I am picky. My boyfriend liked the variety. Lots of variety, yes, but I felt the quality was not good. I wished they had more authentic Mexican food. The guacamole came from a bag and pico de gallo was only available during lunch (not with nachos during regular snack hours.)

My husband and I chose this resort from looking at places from the earth view on Google (really) and ultimately the recommendation from our travel agent. We prefer the low-key all inclusives with some character, and the reviews overall looked good. It wasn't a long drive from Cancun airport, and easy enough to find (we rented a car for the trip). It was after dark when we arrived, but the dinner buffet was still open, as was the upstairs bar. Other than the nightly show, there wasn't a whole lot going on. The next day and all the days following were a great time though. The location of the resort itself is pretty great. It isn't a long walk to town along the shore, the beach is great, and it's located just north of some of the larger resorts. You can enjoy the waves crashing in the water, or sit back and people watch. If hanging on the beach gets old (ha!), they have two pools, including the one with the swim up bar. Jesus will definitely take care of you. All the great comments about him are no lie. He is a great guy. One bummer for us was the little hot tub was never warm, but no big deal. And even though EVERY ONE of the beach beds and a good amount of the loungers are reserved before we were even up at 7 for breakfast, we never had trouble finding a lounger when we were ready to chill on the beach. The resort overall was very beautiful. All of the lush plants, weaving walkways, and little treasures to discover never got old. We stayed in room 513, first floor, near the tea time social area. Our patio looked out onto one of the walkways. It was quiet and peaceful. I enjoyed our room. It was a good size and very clean. I especially liked the \"moon\" light on the patios. It set a very intimate feel for an evening walk. Our air conditioner had a leaking problem, but we've dealt with worse, so we didn't bother calling.

There were plenty of pillows and I would always go to bed tired from the day. You do hear a lot going on in the surrounding rooms, and you will smell it when your next door neighbors are smoking pot. But how much time are you planning on hanging in your room in the middle of the day? The bars were plentiful, we usually ended up at the pool bar. Eventually, you get used to the hours of the bars and restaurants. As far as the food went, we never went hungry. Breakfast was nice. They had a little area set up so you can make yourself a mimosa or bloody mary if you please. There were always pastries, fruits, juices, omelets, and even some authentic specialties. For you picky eaters, well, there's cereal. Lunch was a pretty basic buffet. Outstanding, no, but we always had something decent to eat. I'd recommend keeping that meal small if you are doing a lot of activities. Dinners were usually good too. The buffet for dinner did the trick fine. I usually went with pasta. Three of the nights we ate at the a la carte places. Botticelli's is in a dimly lit telephone shaped room, with windows all around and a very romantic feel. They had good pasta, a decent little salad bar and I really liked the house red wine. The salmon there was very good. The chicken and lamb I wasn't as impressed with. Terraza grill was something I assumed to be more casual, but when we went to eat there, it was very upscale looking and was good as well. The resort also had a great ice cream bar in the afternoons, which was set up overlooking the cenote by the lobby, and a snack bar open pretty much all day for more a more casual option. Be patient though, it can get backed up quickly. We did get an invitation to pick up our \"welcome gift\" which did have something to do with listening to the timeshare deal, but we just said we weren't interested. That was that. No big deal. The resort does die down at nighttime, but you can always make your way to the front area of the resort and hang by the bar or go see the nightly show the entertainment crew puts on. We saw a couple of them. Not bad. My only suggestion would be to amp up the performance room. Maybe remodel the room or make it an indoor/outdoor style venue. They do a pretty good job but it would be nice if more guests were able to see the show. We did have an outing one day to Chichen Itza, and the Dzitnip cenote (sp?). We rented a car which I recommend if you want to choose when you leave rather than waiting for a 7am tour. Eric the concierge was so helpful about making sure we knew where we were going and gave us maps. It was a great venture and a really nice drive. Our camera broke at Chichen Itza, so we didn't get many pictures. The cenote was fun (cave swimming!). We didn't bother stopping at Coba since the camera broke. The second to last day, it rained all morning. The canopy of trees on the resort kept the walkways relatively dry, and we passed the time by playing billiards upstairs. After the rain stopped, it was perfect for walking into town and shopping on 5th ave. There are some good places to eat, and a lot of shopping. We even found a place with a \"tequila museum\", it was pretty insane. The overcast day made the walking weather perfect along the shore. The resort allowed us to have a late checkout, so we were able to enjoy every minute of our last morning. Not only that, Eric helped us out when our rental car wouldn't start. What a great help he was! I'm not planning on going back to Mexico any time soon, but I would go back to this place because I wasn't ready to leave.", "Date": "March 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cDelightful, intimate resort... wonderful beach\u201d", "Author": "islatiempo", "ReviewID": "UR99428179", "Content": "My husband and I spent the week of Feb 12 at The Reef and had a wonderful experience escaping Chicago's dreadful winter weather.

Upon arrival, check in was quick and efficient. Gus came over and said he would be our consierge at the Reef. He gave us a brief summary on the hotel bars, restaurants and then quickly veered the subject to visiting a sister hotel for a tour and getting our Mexican package aka a timeshare presentation. I signed up and we were escorted to our room 531 which had a lovely view of a parking lot. I might add, the Reef does not have elevators so if you have health or mobility problems, that could be a problem. I did ask if ther were any rooms on 1st or 2nd floors and was told they were full.. The resort grounds are gorgeous with the hotel being built in to a jungle environment with cednotes and water falls. It is a short walk to the 2 pools and pool bar and the beach. Since we have been to Mexico 9 times and have visited 7 resort areas, we canceled our time share presnetation the next day. It is our opinion that the resort does not have enough chairs pool side or beach side. I know many people are up at 6am to throw their towels on loungers thinking it is there own private lounger that they can have all day even though in many cases, the loungers were un occupied for 4-5 hours. We have been to resorts in Ixtapa and Huatulco that did not allow this to happen. the service at the pool bar was excellant. Jesus and Orlando were great bartenders. Upon arrival, our room refridge was full of cans of soda and water, We were told to go to the lobby bar to get cans of soda. We did this and were told to go to the pool bar. The pool bar said they didn't have cans of soda and we felt like we were getting the run around. We never did get any more cans of soda in our fridge, although we did get bottled water. Also a first, we did not have any drinking glass in our room. This was a first for us in all the places in Mexico we have been to. I asked at the front desk and never really got a direct answer. To make a phone call to the USA from your hotel room was 25 usd for 4 minuted which was highway robbery using a credit card to place the call. the food at the Reef was very good, no complaints on the food at all. Gilbert who worked the breakfast shift was a delight. He was so friendly and a very hard worker. a plus to the Reef. Our room was cleaned every day and although we did have some ants in the bathroom, it was only a a few and the came in though an opening in the window frame. Our daughter tried calling the reosrt from the US and could not get through. The phone switches to an automated system and she would enter our room number and the system would not transfer her to our room. Fortunatly these were not any emergency or ungent calls. I went to the front desk and said she tried calling at 930pm and the man at the desk insisted they answer all the calls which he obviously did not .Since the Reef is only a 15 minute walk to downtown, we found internet cafes where we could send emails and make calls to the USA at a very reasonable rate. We found the grounds throughtout the resort to be very clean and well maintained. One thing I did not like was during our stay, we were approaced by 3 different employess to get our Mexican package aka time share. I do not go on vacation for this unless I am interested in taking a time share presentation. While we did not have any major problems, I did talk to some people who were not happy at the Reef. whether they will post it on trip advisor or not I dont know. We have been to many locations in Mexico and prefer smaller resorts rather than the mega resorts. The Reef Playacar was beautiful, very clean and we did not experience problems that some people talked about. The location is great, most of the staff was friendly, although I think some of the staff needs to be better trained in customer service. The food was good and even though there is not much nitelfe there, a shaort cab ride in town will get you to the clubs if that is your interest. any questons, please feel free to email me.

My wife and I have taken trips south for the last 7 years. We\u2019ve stayed at 5 star resorts and at barely 3 star resorts. The Reef Playacar is definitely one of best places we\u2019ve been to, and we wouldn\u2019t hesitate to return. One of the nicest things about the Reef is that it is small. As a result, there is great staff service. Plus \u2013 no long walks to the beach or any other services. When you\u2019re on a holiday in the sun, who wants to waste their time? Another great thing about the Reef is that it is so close to Playa del Carmen. It\u2019s an easy walk if you choose. I also like the fact that it is in a neighbourhood of vacation homes, which gives it a livelier feel. At no time did we feel unsafe. The grounds are gorgeous \u2013 intimate, lots of lovely greenery and nice design. Small wild (but very tame) agoutis wonder around all the time, and they add a cute flavour to the place. There are two pools, both of which are lovely and were never crowded. One has a swim-up bar. There is a small hot tub which was not all that hot. The beach is awesome \u2013 one of the nicest we\u2019ve been to. There is a TON of room there, and there are lovely terraces leading down to the beach so you can choose the surface you want to lounge on. The resort has a number of outdoor \u2018beds\u2019 on these terraces, which looked nice but were in great demand. Otherwise, lounge chairs were abundant. The swimming was lovely, and there are lots of water activities available if you wish. The main restaurant was fine. It had a decent variety of food which changed daily. Certainly not luxury but just as good as other resorts we have been to. The a la carte restaurants were good, with excellent service. In many places you have to reserve those tables - the material in the room said the same. However, we were told that you could just walk in. Surprisingly, they weren\u2019t all that busy. Well worth checking out. The bars are well stocked and there are lots of great drinks. We had excellent service from Felix at the beach bar. The night time entertainment was typical resort fare but fine. Our room was fine with the standard amenities. It was nice to have a balcony to enjoy the view. The air conditioning worked well and kept us nice and cool. The only downside is that the mattress was quite hard. I was ok with it but it was not as great for my wife (though she still would happily return). Finally, the resort has at least 3 sweet, stray cats. We loved to find them lounging on someone\u2019s patio or looking for food. They weren\u2019t a nuisance and, if you are an animal lover, it was nice to have their company. Overall \u2013 we had an excellent experience at the Reef. It\u2019s a gorgeous, small resort with amazing staff and all you need for an enjoyable vacation.

Security physically acosted me & my GF\u201d", "Author": "linfisher", "ReviewID": "UR96930463", "Content": "Warning to All..., First, please note that I am a senior executive who works with many of the world's largest and well known hotels in the world. I have a very keen eye and ear to how hotels operate and treat their customers. This was a total scam! The hotel was nice enough in quality of build and sense of arrival. Check in was fairly smooth. After checking in and asking standard questions about the property, I was relatively satisfied and ready to settle in to my room. The room was not 100% what I asked for but i didn't stress since I was on holiday. My girl got there 4 days before I did and we wanted two places to stay. One on the beach at the villa and one at the hotel close to all the parties and people. So she was NOT staying with me as her primary lodging. SHE WAS JUST VISITING. THE SCAM... I walked my girl into the hotel and was abruptly stopped by security. They said we had to have her check in with the front desk. We said \"ok.\" Once we got to the front desk, I was expecting to have some type of wrist band given to her that would state \"THIS PERSON IS NOT TO BE SERVED ANY \"ALL INCLUSIVE\" SERVICES.\" A guest pass of sorts. In short **********They tried to charge me $50 A DAY for her to even walk on property. I told them to put a band on her that would keep employees from serving her all inclusively. They said everyone who comes on property must pay and must have a band. We just wanted to grab a few items and maybe have a quick smootch fest. In ANY all-inclusive hotel that I have been, if you don\u2019t have a band, you don\u2019t get served. And in some cases, they give you a band that clearly states not to serve that person and if you don\u2019t have a band that is when you get kicked off property. Suffice to say, I was livid! Think about it\u2026 If I wanted to have 3 friends over for a glass of wine in my room that I purchased it would cost me $150 a day for that privilege. That is worse than a night club! They were total jerks and not customer friendly. I told them that I was not told this would be the case and since my whole plan was to entertain from time to time some friends who were down there\u2026 that would be an absurd thing to do\u2026 I want out! When I asked to simply be refunded my money due to their lack of communication when I was asking them about the property, they said NO. The manager couldn\u2019t care less and had no empathy. I tried every combination of option to get what I was asking for and to ensure they could adhere to their policies. They couldn\u2019t care less. *****The physical accosting***** After 30 minutes of trying to work it out and explain why I was totally misled and not informed about their policies, I told them I was leaving and that I would take it up with AMEX and EVERY travel site I could find to let the world know what kind of racquet this hotel had set up. I told my girl to follow me regardless of their policy so that I could pack and get the EFF outta there. I told the staff that we were going to leave and we had NO desire to be stay there a minute longer. When we started to walk to the room a security guard came running after us. My girl was walking in front of me and to my left. I saw the security guard reach aggressively for her arm to pull her back so I grabbed his arm and pulled him back from touching her. After removing him from our personal space we kept on walking towards the room and then the security guard ran in front of me and grabbed my shirt. I\u2019m 6\u20194\u201d 205\u2026 he was 5\u20197\u201d 150\u2026 you do the math. I moved him like a sheet of paper in a hurricane. If he wouldn\u2019t have been so aggressive we would have stopped or not engaged that way. He kept yelling, I\u2019m going to call the policia. We kept saying please do\u2026! They expected us to trash the room and take stuff\u2026 We just wanted to leave that place fast as possible. Don\u2019t get trapped in this hotel thinking they work like other All-Inclusive hotels.

They had a 50\" plasma tv in there room so they were thrilled. The room also happened to be on the top floor of a building 2 in from the pool, so the location was outstanding.

It's a beautiful resort with a sort of \"urban jungle\" landscaping and meandering walkways. The beach is beautiful--white sand, clean beach. This resort is at least 20 years old and they have maintained it well. Our biggest complaint was the noise level from the service carts going back and forth on the walkways right outside our room. They start at 6:00 am and go until about 11:00 pm. However, the entire resort did not seem to have this issue. If I go back, I would ask for a room near the cenote, where it is quieter, or at least away from the restaurants. Our room was on the first floor, close to the pools, restaurants and beach, but I would have preferred to be further away from the beach to get a quieter room--or, at least a room on an upper floor. I also think that they need to upgrade their towels. They've been in service for quite awhile. The restaurants were very good, but not exceptional.

The only concern we had was with the bed...way too hard, but when we brought it to their attention, they offered to put us in another room. Athough there are 188 hotels in Playa Del Carmen, we will definately be back to The Reef Playacar!!!!", "Date": "February 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Smyrna, Delaware", "Title": "\u201cGreat place for the price....\u201d", "Author": "HondaTraveler38", "ReviewID": "UR95556678", "Content": "My girlfriend and I visited The Reef for 7 days in mid December. We got a great deal on our trip so we decided to give it a try. I would rate the resort average, but for what we payed for it, it was worth it. I have been to many all-inclusive resorts, I would say that this is at the bottom of my list for a couple reasons. 1. The buffets were as expected, bad. The food was not hot, there was no variety, and breakfast( which is usually the best buffet) was horrible. We did try both of the sit-down places for dinner, they were both better than expected. The steak-house was the better of the two, my steak was done perfectly, not the best cut of steak mind you, but very tasty and not tough. The Italian place was very good as well. I can tell you that we lived off of the snack bar most of the week. The cheese fries and burgers were great, just make sure you ask for a fresh burger on the grill! The after dinner tacos at the snack bar were also very good. But again, my expectations for the food was very low having been to many all-inclusives, and I was still dissapointed in the buffets. 2. The bars were never open when advertised, and the drinks are made with some kind of fruit mix. I am not a big drinker, but on vacation I like to kick back with a nice fruity drink...not here, stick to the beer. The rooms are average at best, bed wasn't to bad, but the lack of sound-proofing was a problem. I am a sound sleeper, but my girlfriend woke up a couple nights from banging and yelling. The staff is okay, a little pushy until you give them a firm NO about the time-share. I would go back if I could get the same deal I got this time, but The Reef would be nowhere near my first choice of places to return to. Again, for the price, not bad.", "Date": "February 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cNot perfect, but generally excellent resort\u201d", "Author": "io_saturnalia", "ReviewID": "UR95335767", "Content": "The only drawbacks I found during our recent stay were the dinner buffet -- it tasted fine, but was unexceptional and hardly authentic Mexican (though I understand that's the way it is with all-inclusive set-ups) -- and the fact that some of the staff with something to sell were a TINY bit on the pushy side. I get that moving product and services is the name of the game, but I don't want to be \"invited\" to a breakfast (to hear about time shares) when I'm trying to check in to the place, especially after a long day of travel from Boston. Similarly, if I'm chilling by the pool with my eyes closed or glued to a book, that's not the time I want to hear about snorkeling. OK, those are minor drawbacks. In general, the staff were cheerful and helpful and the vibe was just about as relaxing as I had hoped for. Here are some of the highlights: The Azul swim-up bar was fun with Jesus keeping the booze flowing and the action entertaining. This was a great place to meet new friends. Tip a hundred pesos every couple of days and the service is even more exceptional. The beach was beautiful and the water warm enough for all-day swimming, but still refreshing. The buffet breakfasts and lunches were excellent, though we usually took our mid-day nourishment at the estimable snack bar. Never made it there for late-night eats. At the buffet, the server Mary was top-notch, keeping the weak but tasty coffee filled. Other staff was a lot more lackadaisical, but it was no big deal in the buffet setting. Better service, in general, if you sit on the patio, and you can't beat the seaview in the a.m. The Italian restaurant on site was quite good; the \"Mexican\" one was more of a steakhouse. Good food, though limited options. Papa's bar -- the one that goes until 2 a.m. -- was OK but, frankly, a little lackluster. Still, there are plenty of seats. The last thing I will say is that, as a childless couple, we were a bit bummed out by the abundance of children on the property at first. However, and perhaps b/c most of the kids weren't Americans, their behavior was exemplary. It was refreshing to see and, despite the property being at full occupancy, it was just about as quiet (even in the mornings) as we needed it to be. If you're looking for adventure, there's plenty around there, too, though you're probably better off renting a car and driving to Tulum and the various attractions yourself. Cheaper that way. However, we were all about catching rays, swimming, drinking and eating.", "Date": "February 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ga", "Title": "\u201cNot if you want any sleep, but a beautiful place none the less\u201d", "Author": "arwen944", "ReviewID": "UR95297314", "Content": "THE BAD FIRST: If you don't really care about sleeping on your vacation, then this may be a good option for you. We stayed the week before Christmas and the first night was a disaster. We were on the 2nd floor of our building and we could hear every single door slam from our floor and both above and below us. The buildings are all tile and there are 4 rooms per floor around a tiny foyer so everything echoes REALLY badly. Then the doors are not true hotel doors, but rather wooden plantation shutter style doors than you can see under and over. Definitely not very private. We could even hear when the people around us went to the restroom. This noise went on until everyone came back from the clubs at around 4 am, and then the early birds above us were up stomping around and slamming drawers at 5:30 am. Wow..1 and 1/2 hours of sleep-great. Even my husband who sleeps like a log was up all night, and that despite having our white noise maker on it's loudest setting next to the bed. (I highly recommend one if you usually sleep with a fan). Our 2 year old was in a playpen, so she kept waking up crying all night because when any of the neighboring rooms would slam their door it would vibrate and shake her out of her sleep. Our 5 year old and I headed out at 7 am to the front desk to get a room change. We were switched to the 3rd floor (top) of another building on the back side to try to get farther away from the noise. This did help a little, but it is honestly just a severe lack of soundproofing. You could hear every step people took up 3 flights of stairs because of the echoing tile. One person came in the middle of the night and actually DRUG all their bags up the stairs..boom, boom, boom -you get my drift. And a lot of the younger clubbing crowd were VERY rude. One night at 2 am some girls came into the adjoining building and were yelling so loud across the courtyard it woke us up. I peeped my head out of our door to nicely ask them to keep it down since our baby was sleeping and all I got was a string of obscenities. I complained to management and all they said was...it's Christmas..people are partying. They did offer to finally move us across the street to one of their other properties on the last night, but by then it wasn't worth packing everything up to go to a place I had no idea about. KIDS CLUB: We went EVERY single day for 6 days straight and never found anyone there. Even when they first opened and at the end of the day, there was always a note on the door saying \"we are at the beach\". I was not going to trust complete strangers to supervise our 5 year old anywhere near the ocean OR the pool. We wanted him to do some fun games or art and take a break from the sun, which is one of the reasons we booked this hotel. We did search for them at the beach one day, but they were nowhere to be found (kinda like the elusive unicorn-does it really exist or not?) THE FOOD: We were happy enough with the selections, and we are VERY, VERY picky eaters. I knew from other reviews that we should fill up on breakfast and grab fruit for later. Be warned that one of the cooks pours a lot of milk (leche) into the scrambled eggs in the morning, but if you can catch her before she pours the milk in you can have regular scrambled eggs. Many of the staff don't understand english (to be expected), but if you at least try a little spanish and learn the words you need to know before going it will help a lot. There is a lot of pork for all meals on the buffet, so be warned if you are allergic or can't eat for religious reasons. We don't drink alcohol, but the non-alcoholic pina coladas, daiquiris, etc. were some of the worst we have ever had at a beach resort. Very kool-aid mix tasting-Yuk. The 2 nicer restaurants that open for dinner were elegant and the outdoor dining areas for both were very romantic. The steak at the mexican place was delicious..even our 2 year old wanted more (and she hardly eats anything but fruit and bread).*LOCATION: WOW-absolutely stunning. This was our 2nd trip and the beach was even more spectacular than I remembered. White sand and crystal clear blue water with plenty of chairs and shade nearby..our idea of heaven. The addition of the lounging canopy beds is a luxurious touch that we deeply appreciated (if we didn't have the kids we would have slept out there at night!) The grounds of the hotel were always clean and are very exotic feeling with the wooden pathways up in the trees, the waterfall, and natural cenote. The ice cream parlor was a favorite with our family -YUM! Warning--This area, along with many others around the resort, is not handicap accessible or for people with unsure footing, so be careful. **THE GOOD: The concierge and staff were very accommodating for our son's 6th birthday and our anniversary, which made us feel special. The people here are very hard-working and genuinely friendly (unlike Jamaica) and we never felt bullied into tipping or that we were a burden with any request. There was free bottled water at the lobby bar every day if you just asked (we brush our teeth with it). Our son swam with dolphins at Dolphinaris for his birthday and it was a beautiful facility with lots of dolphins and trainers. Extremely good priced compared to the US and worth every penny. We booked online before the trip and saved quite a bit. We did splurge for a few professional pics which were outrageously expensive~ $29 each(knew from previous reviews), but they do let you take pics from afar and I actually got some pretty good videos since my camera has a zoom function. The market down the street to the left of the resort was nice and had many value priced souvenirs. We tried going to the aviary/zoo down to the right, but the price has gone up astronomically (from about $5, to $22 per person), so we knew it wasn't worth it since we had been before. I will say that during our previous stay we were in a honeymoon suite closest to the beach and it was much quieter. If you can get one of those upgraded rooms, I would definitely recommend this hotel because it is so beautiful.", "Date": "February 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Grand Junction, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cGreat Resort, however Beds of Concrete!\u201d", "Author": "smootzy", "ReviewID": "UR95093110", "Content": "The hotel was beautiful and the beach amazing.

This is also the first time i've chosen to write a review and it has compelled me to write a review on our resort from last year as well as it was far superior and this hotel left me nostalgic for it. I'll start with the positive: The grounds are incredible, beyond beautiful. The beach is perfect, the location is ideal an made getting around very easy. We got out quite often to do some deep sea fishing, Xplore and lots of trips into town (town itself is becoming quite annoying due to the constant pestering. It can be charming your first time there but it really does take away from the vibe of the town. I was asked every 5 minutes if I wanted coke or weed and twice called expletives for not accepting.) Some of the staff are very nice and do a great job. Felix at the bar closest to the Marina and the sweet lady that makes omlettes at breakfast were a few of the stand outs. The food is decent for this type of resort. what we've come to expect. I tried scuba diving for the first time through the reef marina and couldn't begin to say enough great things about the staff there. Bert (my instructor) was calming and patient which made my first dive and experience I will NEVER forget. The drawbacks. The beds are horrible, had some of the worst sleeps of my life. We woke up many times during the night with back/neck pain. This would be something very simple for them to fix that would make a huge difference. Some of the staff is quite rude and selective on who they cater too. ie. spanish speaking guests. (we always try to speak spanish when we are in mexico and this is the first time I felt talked down to for not being fluent.) The time share people are liars and can be very very aggressive. We booked a presentation with another hotel just to be able to see the grounds and out of curiosity. When that rep came to pick us up we were \"intercepted\" on the front grounds by three of the reef reps in an intimidating fashion. The one rep Eric made an offer to us to come to their presentation. Wishing to avoid further conflict on our holiday we accepted. None of the promises were met and we ended up getting way less for our time than if we had gone to the other presentation. Eric became more and more fake and obnoxious as the days went by always calling out \"hey buddies, you guys are awesome , my best clients, I love you.\" I've never met such an annoying person. Needless to say we didn't buy a time share. All in all we had a great holiday mainly because of what we made of it. It's really too bad this hotel is so lacking in some key areas because it really could be the perfect place with a little tweaking. I would not recommend this hotel to friends nor would we return ourselves as we have been to other resorts that are far superior in key areas.

The rooms are arranged around a stairwell, 4 rooms per floor, and each door is really close the other. You can hear neighbors walking up and down stairs and especially in front of all the doors.

We got a day trip for four (Tulum and Xel Ha) and it was a disaster. No one showed up to pick us up, after waiting an hour they got us a taxi but with unclear directions.

While this wasn't my favorite resort, it had some great qualities. I'll break the review up into sections. First impression/Check-in: Wonderful! The lobby area is small, but beautiful. I usually prefer open air receptions, but this lobby was enclosed and did stay nice and cool. We expected to be hounded by time share reps, but there wasn't a single one that I saw. I know others in our group did sit through a presentation, but they all said no firmly and were not bothered after that. Check-in was easy and efficient. Eric in the reception is wonderful and greeted me by name before I even checked in!! We were with a larger group (several of which had been at the resort for a couple days) and he recognized me from my mom's description. That was really nice...attention to detail and genuine interest in the guests. Grounds: Stunning! This resort is set in a tropical jungle, and the natural beauty is breath taking. This is definitely not a stuffy, concrete, 5* resort. You leave the lobby and immediately feel as though you've been transported to an oasis. It's wonderful. I can't say enough about how beautiful and well maintained the grounds are...you just have to see it for yourself! There are sereques (I call them \"squirrely rabbits\"), anoles, and kitties (we named the little black and white one Moo-Moo...she loves pork and milk!) all over the resort. Beach: Pretty nice. The beach is a good size and there are always plenty of chairs. The sand is really soft, it's just littered with broken sea shells which can be a little sharp. The view is priceless. I spent the majority of my five days sitting on the beach soaking up the sun. Pools: There are two pools, both very small, one with a swim-up bar. While they were small, they did look very nice and clean. I never went in them because I spent all my time by the ocean, but I heard they were cold this time of year. Bars: My only real complaint is that my fruity drinks weren't made with real fruit. I'm usued to ordering a strawberry daquiri and it being made with real strawberries. The sugary fakeness wasn't all that appealing. I did find a few drinks that I loved though, including my favoite, the Cabanas. You usually have to ask for a straw, you don't automatically get one. Tip these guys and you'll get better drinks (and straws!), plus they deserve it. Food: I'm not going to lie and say that the food was great. Some of it was, but most of it was just ok. I've definitely had better at the Iberostars and other resorts. There was always fresh fruit and breads which were good, but a lot of the other dishes were hit and miss. Lunch and dinner were much better than breakfast, which surprised me as it's usually the other way around. My breakfast foods were always cold and unappealing. For lunch and dinner, the buffet did have really good entrees (fish, chicken, pastas, etc.). The a la carte restaraunts were really good, we tried both the Italian and the Steak House. We had lasagna which was really great, and the flank steak which was much better than I expected...tender and juicy, even for being prepared well done. I had read a lot of reviews about the snack bar being gross, but that was one of our favorite places to eat! The chicken wings were awesome! My husband loved the cheeseburgers, and I really liked the hotdogs. I heard that you could order room service, but it was an extra charge (would be nice if that was included). Rooms: Our room seemed to be nicely updated. We had a flat panel Sony Bravia TV, although most others in our group had older tube TVs. Didn't really matter, we only watched TV one night. We didn't have a tub, but all of the other rooms did. Our shower was really nice and clean, though. The beds and pillows are absolutely horrible. I've come to expect that in Mexico, though. Drink enough Cabanas and you won't care. Seriously though, the beds do suck...it'd be great if they would provide some sort of matress topper. The pillows were like laying on sheets of plywood...very hard. As I said, that is expected in Mexico. The water pressure in the shower wasn't all that great and the temperature was a gamble. Overall, nice rooms. The things that were annoying (the beds, water temp) are more of a Mexico thing than a black mark against the resort. Housekeeping: I don't think that our sheets were changed every day, which is ok...conservation! Our water bottles were replaced every day and we had no issues (as did anybody else in our almost 20 person group) with our items going missing. Just to be on the safe side, we did lock our valuables in one of our suitcases. I was annoyed that you had to pay for a safe...most resorts don't charge for that, so that was a bit disappointing. Activities/Shows: This isn't the most lively resort, and I didn't notice very many activities going on other than beach volleyball and water aerobics. The nightly shows were really impressive though! It's amazing how talented and hard working the event staff are. There isn't a club/disco on the resort, so it definitely isn't for partiers. We did have a lot of fun at the roof top bar though! Wedding: The reason for the trip was because my brother got married at the Reef. The setting was gorgeous and intimate (well, as intimate as it can be with an entire beach watching!). However, I was a little disappointed in the ceremony. It was extremely short and didn't seem to be all that well organized. They didn't even get to recite any vows!! I wish it would have been a little more personal. Also, nobody was informed that the bride and groom would have to sign the marriage certificate and be fingerprinted after their first kiss, so that was really awkward as we all looked around like \"Umm, ok...why are they doing this now?!\". It would have been nice to have the heads up so the guests and wedding party weren't looking around all confused. There was a nice little cocktail reception afterwards, though, and that turned out beautifully. Be prepared that you have to pay extra for everything....including a stereo if you want to hook up an iPod. Staff of note: Eric from the reception was SO incredibly friendly and helpful...anything we needed was taken care of. Eric the waiter at the rooftop bar was so sweet and offered great service. He was always right there when our glasses ran empty and always had a smile on his face. Fernando, event & activity staff, was very cool. He was a ton of fun...quite the jokester. Our entire family loved him and he made sure we were always having a good time! Leonard, the DJ, was a lot of fun, too. Felix at the beach bar made great drinks! Overall: Everybody in our group had an amazing time. We couldn't have asked for a better location. We are not stuffy people and don't do mega resorts. The Reef was exactly what we were looking for. The food got repetative, but it was fine for under a week. The beds could use some serious improving, but we didn't let be a damper on our trip. The staff is mostly great and seemed very friendly. The positives far outweigh the negatives, and we would return for future vacations!", "Date": "January 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cdont use the travel agency at the Reef!\u201d", "Author": "rena59", "ReviewID": "UR92129357", "Content": "First I would like to say that while I was staying at the Reef It was an overall good experience- it has beautiful grounds, good food with very friendly & hard working staff.

Getting home and looking at my Visa bill I realized that they had charged me twice for the tour under two different names! One under Mayaland tours,which is the hotels company, and again under Easy tours- which is the tour he actually sent us on!!

This resort is for those who like smaller boutique hotels. The hotel consists of 18 colourful Mexican styled villas set in a lush tropical garden. A meandering tiled path, leading from the beach to the hotel lobby, separate the villas. A pleasant stroll. A bonus is a tea house nestled under a giant Banyan tree in the centre of the garden. A pleasant place to relax and enjoy a light snack, tea & made on-the-spot Spanish coffee. The resort's dining is generally good with a Mexican flare. The staff was polite, friendly and helpful.

I feel that my expectations were met or exceeded in many areas with the Reef Playacar. The resort is beautiful - in a natural, intimate way...not the huge posh resort type of feel - but very comfortable and easy to navigate. The natural surroundings added so much enjoyment to our stay there. The staff is friendly and helpful and the place is kept very clean. The pools weren't very crowded even though it was quite hot out (the pools were pretty chilly). the food was great in both the buffet and the Italian restaurant. We were disappointed that we were never able to try the Terraza Grill - it was closed all three nights we attempted to go. We only saw 2 shows - the first was the MJ show on New Year's Eve. I have to comment first on the amazing party the staff put on for New Year's - they transformed the theatre room into a beautiful setting for the party - complete with ice sculptures and beautiful lighting. They had a live band playing throughout the evening as well as the staff's Michael Jackson show. both were very entertaining. The location of the hotel is perfect - on a beautiful beach and within walking distance to 5th avenue in Playa del Carmen. A short cab ride will cost $5 each way. Oh and a definite highlight are the sunbeds on the beach and poolside - fabulous! If those are all taken then you will still be able to find a regular deck chair by the pool or on the beach - I cannot say the same for some other Cancun resorts we have stayed at!

Best of all...do not have to take little trains to get around like bigger resorts. Rooms were clean (mattress checked), choice of pillows (soft-hard). Rooms are basic, fridges stocked with water, and pop, bathrooms have hairdryers. I felt safe, it was clean, and the locaton is amazing...and I was on vacation to be out and about, not spending the week in my room. If looking for early coffee, it is served near the buffet at sunrise. We walked 45 minutes each way on the beach and never had obstacles except dock in Playa del Carmen but walked under it and continued. Playa del Carmen has good nitelife and lots of shops. There is a Starbucks, Guess store, Subway, McDonalds... . The a la carte restaurants were good. Food on resort was good, a mix for everyone. This hotel is the closest hotel to Playa Del Carmen situated in Playacar. Playacar is a gated community with beautiful houses, grounds, and resorts. In Playa del carmen you will find the ferry to cross over to Cozumel if snorkeling or scuba interests you - or make it a short day trip seeing that you are a skip and a hop away from the ferry. I have previously stayed in 2 five stars and one 4 star and did enjoy their luxuries but the location, beach, and quaintness of this hotel was quite satisfying. Activities done: deep-sea fishing arranged by Pablo, snorkeling, Tulum, para-sailing, and snorkeling in cenotes(caves) Dos Ojos (2 eyes). Once in Playa del Carmen, we took a Collectivo (3$), small 8-10 passenger public bus that brings you up and down main road. Dos Ojos is not very touristic yet and it is quite a snorkeling adventure.

We had requested 2 rooms side by side,1 with king bed and 1 with two double beds. Check in was a breeze but got 2 rooms both with double beds. This was corrected the next morning and we were moved to a room with king bed. Rooms - were standard size, very clean and had bottled water and a stocked mini fridge with assorted cans of pop. Yes, you have to pay $2 day for the room safe but definitely worth it. There is no charge to have the bottled water or the cans of pop restocked each day. Actually bottled water is available at all bars anytime day or evening. There was no limit as we have read in other reviews. You can ask for 1, 2 or 5. A side note - ask for a room facing into the cenote area, much quieter. We had a room facing the outside of the property and it was quite noisy 3-6am each day with the service staff bringing in carts of supplies, etc. Wheels squeaked along and carts rattled. As well there are no non smoking rooms however the rooms did not smell of cigarette smoke at all. We believe because it was Christmas and the resort was full, there were a number of families with small children - definitely not an adults only resort! The hotel is a small 212 room 3 storey villa style with walk ups. Each room has private balcony with chairs/table. The hotel is very well maintained, very clean and has dense jungle like vegetation. Beautiful pathways of wood and beautiful wooden railings everywhere. The cleaning staff polishes and dusts each day - there were no broken railings anywhere as we have read in another review. If anything, the wooden walkway areas and railings are gorgeous and are taken care of in a meticulous manner! There are agoutis seen at anytime but are silent creatures and did not bother or scare anyone. Quit interesting to watch them eat bananas! The beach is wide and long - beautiful sand, very clean. You can walk the beach for 30 minutes from either direction of the hotel (longer if you choose). Water is clean and warm. The beach is about 60-80 feet wide with lots of sun loungers and covered sun beds. Never a problem getting a lounger even though the hotel was fully booked. The covered sun beds usually had towels on them by 6am but loungers always available. If you want a covered sun bed (and we highly recommend!) go down at 6am and place your towel or book on one - grab a delicious Mexican coffee to go from the buffet restaurant at the same time! The food was very good. There are 3 major venues - Chulavista buffet (7am-11am, 12:30 - 3pm, 6:30 -10:30pm) Botticelli and Terraza Grill. Botticelli was our favourite - Italian food, excellent Italian food! No reservations required however you must dress up - no shorts, sandals - men its long pants (no jeans) and covered shoes or they will send you away to change! The key is casual elegance. Definitely worth it! The food, service the best ever!! Chulavista Buffet is great for breakfast & lunch - lots of variety and the hot food is hot and the cold food is cold - we read a number of reviews complaining about the food - there is something for everyone and the food is tasty - Christmas Eve there was a special feast prepared, truly amazing!!! There is also a beach snack bar (11am - 5pm and 10:30 - 2am) for burgers, fries, wings, tacos, nachos, pizza, sandwiches. The kids loved it! Booze - drinks were cold and delicious. All bars had good drink makers. Felix was our favourite - he manned the beach bar and makes the best mojitos! Ask him for a frozen lemonade & tequila...yummy! Tipping is always good but doesnt get you better service or better quality alcohol. It does get you recognition though! Felix had our regular order started before we reached his counter ! Always a big smile, anytime during the day!! Beer you can get as draft in a glass or ask for a tin (Sol, Tecate, Dos XX) 1 can or 3, they give you what you ask for. Including water lol Staff - were very friendly and accomodating. We never ever had a problem with anyone. Daniel the front door bellman is fabulous if you need anything (taxi, restaurant recommendation, store luggage, special favour). Polino was a great waiter as was Edwardo, Juan, we could just keep going!. Victoria makes a wicked omlette in the morning!! Safety - the whole Playacar area is gated so safety was never in question. Walked around outside and in Playa del Carmen - on beach and on road, took taxi back at night for $5. No problems whatsoever, very comfortable at all times. We took a full day tour to Tulum which included zipling, canoeing and jungle trecking in a jeep, lunch with a Mayan family at their home. Lots of fun and reasonable at $99 person. A visit to the Lapis factory (they provide free transportation to and from) has negligible lapis pieces. Lots of silver, good quality jewellery a bit overpriced even at 50% off. However, the quality speaks for itself. We picked up a couple pieces and do not regret it. The beach is mercifully free of annoying vendors. You can get anything you want at Playa del Carmen. Most stalls selling silver, etc. They will bargain 40-50% off asking price. Entertainment was ok - provided by hotel staff (yes, towel girl by day and entertainer at night hahaha) First day was good, next two mediocre. Special Christmas shows, last day was a Cirque de Soleil style entertainment, very professional and amazing to watch! There is a coffee service in the cenote area each afternoon from 4-6pm. Absolutely amazing! You can have a Spanish, Mexican, Mayan coffee made (as many as you want) and there is NO extra charge. Also great sandwiches and chocolate chip cookies. We loved the champagne and sat there each afternoon chatting with other guests while sipping our coffee and drinking champagne. The ice cream palor serves up a variety of flavour in a cone or cup. Also has a variety of coffee, expresso etc - No additional charge Beach massage is a definite - Mauro is amazing and will do a total body exfoliation included with massage!! We enjoyed our vacation and would definitely recommend this resort to others.

Reef was the perfect choice. We went in April, sorry for the late review. We are a couple in our 30s and this is a pretty honest review. Airport/ Check-in: The line-up for immigration and baggage was extremely long and ran through the whole airport. It took over an hour. From Cancun airport to Reef, after a few drop-offs, took another hour. Check-in was quick but had to meet the resort rep right away and get a general intro. Jeanine was nice. Room Room was basic, spacious, very clean, nice balcony, nice clean bathroom, plenty of water bottle, big sink. AC was loud though but in good condition. Bed wasn\u2019t the most comfortable but nice enough. Alarm clock on bedside. TV worked fine. Maid was very thorough. Weather It was hot, nice tanning hot. April is a good time to visit. Water was warm after 10. Beach/ Pool: Beach is long, pure white sand. Loved it. Ocean was light green color, just gorgeous beach altogether. Waves are quite strong but not much seaweed. You gotta wake up early to get shade. Towel rules apply. Beach volleyball and yoga was nice. Pool was small and crowded but still nice. Kids everywhere. Pool was 2 minutes from our room and the beach was 4 minutes, so no complaints. Bars Bars made drinks very well. They knew their stuff. Pool bar was really busy. They work very hard and are friendly. please tip! It goes a long way and will get you better service and will make a difference to your trip overall. Restaurants The a la carte was nothing special, alternating between Italian and Mexican. We loved the food. Authentic Mexican food also available and tastes spicy but great. The main buffet has great variety. Pizza and soups were a constant and we had different dishes everyday. The late night snack bar offered fresh chicken tacos and hot dogs, and they must have liked us a lot because they would bring us beer or wine from the main buffet area and walk it over to us on the sunbeds at night. The meals were always fresh and tasted great. The main buffet\u2019s best feature is the ocean view on the terrace. We sat on the terrace for almost every meal with the ocean beside us. Resort Facilities For a 3-Star Resort, The Reef packs in a whole lot of value for your money. The hotel lobby is the only thing about this place that resembles a hotel. After you check in and walk through the sliding doors, you\u2019re greeted with an exotic in house waterfall and immediately taken away into a lush green hide \u2013 away. The pathways are either waxed hardwood or strategically placed cement blocks that take you through the resort to your room, and are very will lit at night time. They have stuck with a well maintained rustic look and are consistent with the wood railings along the path to the wood railings on your room balcony. This creates a special ambiance for you and lasts your whole stay. We never got tired of walking around the resort, and enjoyed the wicker furniture and hardwood deck patio built around an ancient gigantic AVATAR tree at the resort\u2019s centre. They have done well to preserve the land that was there before and we loved calling it home for a week. You can see multiple gardeners out all over the resort constantly watering the grounds, they take very good care and memories of the resorts inner landscape will stay with you long after you leave. Entertainment We never made it to any shows. The bar there is very busy at night. Resort Activities are posted on the wall next to the ping pong table. They actually do what they say they\u2019ll do at the times they say they\u2019ll do it. We did Step Classes, Stretch Classes, Beach Volleyball etc. Some resorts post their activities but don\u2019t actually do them. Excursion Went to Chichen Itza to see the ruins and Cozumel for snorkelling. Highly recommend both. The history is amazing. Snorkelling was a memorable experience. Nothing too fancy but well organized by Fury Catamarans, booked both from the agent right outside the lobby, great price. Parasailing was short but fun enough. For 5 bucks you can go to Playa Del Carmen, and it\u2019s a quaint tourist town, great to walk around, shop and enjoy a Cerveza at the restaurant with swings instead of chairs. **We can\u2019t climb the pyramids anymore, but it\u2019s worth the money to see the Mayan Ruins. It\u2019s scorching hot away from the water, so bring lots of bottled water and a sun hat. I didn\u2019t like that they allowed vendors inside the site. Sometimes you will be followed to buy trinkets and such, but it doesn\u2019t ruin the overall trip. Snorkelling in Cozumel. You can bring your own snorkel gear, but if not, it\u2019s provided for you on the Catamaran. You can take the Ferry to Cozumel and back to Playa and if you buy the Ferry ride separate from the excursion, you don\u2019t have to wait until the 9pm Ferry, you can leave when you\u2019re done. You get 2 snorkel sites and usually if the waters are too rough, only 1. We were fortunate to have mild waves and do jump off and snorkel twice. The bbq lunch on the Cozumel beach was nice. Tips: - No internet access at the hotel, but you can catch a ride for 50 pesos or $5USD into town and find internet cafes for very cheap. - Playadel Carmen is well prepared for tourists. If you forget for you Hawaiian Tropicana sunblock, they have this brand in the local shops in town, no problem. - Vendors on the streets are aggressive, just say no and they will leave you alone as soon as you walk past them. We chose to buy our excursions from our resort. - Air conditioner unit is inside your room, bring ear plugs. - There are warnings for time share selling, but were never bothered by anyone for this during at all. - There\u2019s a safe in the room, but you have to pay to use it for the week. DO NOT LOSE THIS KEY, THEY CAN ONLY BREAK WITH A HAMMER \uf04c - They had absolutely no cookies. - You get 3 large bottles of water a day, and they are replenished whether you finished them or not, very nice and much needed in the hot April weather. - Pools are few and small, so wake up early to reserve your pool chairs. The Magic The white sand, the spectacular ocean, long beach, cocktails, Mayan history and the pyramids, snorkelling in Cozumel and the deep blue ocean, great taste and variety of food and architecture of the resort itself.

There were six of us, three college aged and three of us old timers. When staying at All Inclusives we usually stay at 4 or 4 /12 star properties, ie: Iberostar's, Grand Bahia Principe, RIU's. Since we were paying for 5 this time and because of their location to Playa Del Carmen we booked the Reef. We had spent the the day at the Reef on a free Day Pass given to us by the Condo we rented across the street last February so had an idea of what it was about before arriving. The Day Pass didn't include Food or Drinks so really we only knew what the beach and pool were all about. Check In: Arrived at 11:00am and all three rooms were ready, they were all two double bed rooms and we wanted one King Bed so had to wait until 3:00pm for the King Bed. No big deal and we were happy that we had a room to change into our Bathing Suits. Check in was fast, courteous and efficient. Was not approached at any time by a Time Share Representative as reported by others. Grounds: Smaller, much smaller than the Resorts mentioned above and we loved it. Forgot your sunscreen in the room???? No big deal, short walk to and from the beach to get it. Loved,loved, loved the size of this Resort. The Jungle feel it has walking from your the rooms to the beach or Lobby was fantastic. The canopy so thick that we were able to walk from our room to the Reservation restaurant on the other side of the Resort in the pouring down rain and barely getting wet. Very Cool!!!! Grounds are kept very clean as previously reported. It is an older Resort so there are some nicks but all in all in pretty good shape. Pools & Beach- There are 2 pools which are also on the smaller side but held all of the guests perfectly fine. Pools were kept clean, sparkling clean even, for the whole time we were there. Beach was awesome and that was expected, it's the Riviera Maya after all. There is a small cliff to overcome to get into the water from the beach which was caused from the Beach Restoration, guessing this will settle down over time. Not a big deal there are low spots to get up and down just need to locate them. Plenty of lounge chairs around the pool and beach. Never had a problem, even with trying to keep six of us together. I must admit that this is the first All Inclusive I've been to where Lounge Chairs weren't a problem. Kudos to The Reef!!!! We walked the beach into PDC 5 times, twice in the evening, twice in the morning(for coffee) and once in the afternoon. What a great way to work off some of those cervesa's. The afternoon walk landed us at the Pirata Bar for a couple more beers and to refill our mugs for the walk back. Love it!!!! Bars: Four Bars: Lobby Bar, Beach Bar, Pool Bar and Roof Top Bar. We used them all except the Lobby Bar :). Fast, friendly service by ALL of the Bartenders we met. Yes, sometimes there were a few people in front of us getting served but the bartenders were efficient at getting the drinks served. What's the hurry anyways, chill and enjoy the view. Roof Top Bar had Pool Tables (very good shape) and a view of the street. Beach Bar had an excellent view of the beach and ocean and a couple of tables to sit and enjoy your drink. Pool bar was just that, a pool bar. Careful walking down the stairs into the bar area \"Slippery when wet\". DosXX was the beer on tap and they would also break out cans in various other flavors in the evening or upon request(I think). This was convenient for our evening walks into town in the evening. Watered down drinks???? Not according to my hangover's in the morning. :) Restaurants: I usually don't comment on food as it is completely speculative but being as there were 6 of us I can say it was good. Boring, same old thing, blah,blah,blah. What are these folks looking for???? How about you don't eat everything in the whole buffet the first night. There was always fish, pork,chicken, beef and a carving station. All kinds of vegetables, salads, soup, and bread. Pasta I believe was available every night as well. Everything we had was very good, especially the freshly grilled Salmon at the Carving Station. Awesome!!!! I will also mention the freshly prepared Taco's at the Snack Bar for the the Late Night Snack, good stuff. Pizza and pre made sandwiches at the Snack Bar during the day didn't look so good so I passed but the wings were some of the best I have had anywhere. Breakfast Buffet was always good and never used the Lunch Buffet so can't comment there. Kids said it was good though. We went to one Reservation Only Restaurant, the Terraza Grill. Now I'm not a big fan of these restaurants, I have a big problem with wearing pants on a Caribbean Vacation. I don't show up in a tee shirt or bathing suit for any dinner but pants when it is 80F out and many times without Air Conditioning, No Thank You(Rant Over) :). Put on the pants for this Dinner as I was out voted and was glad I did. Outstanding!!!! In quality and presentation. I can say without hesitation that this was the best AI res only restaurant I have ever been too and unfortunately I've been to many :). Our group had the Salmon and Arrachera both excellent, service was impeccable- 5 star. We were out of there in 1 1/2 hours including coffee and deserts, Yeah!!!! There was a Wine List for the Wine Lovers at an additional cost or House Wine included, which to us anyways wasn't bad. There was also an option to upgrade to Lobster and NY Strip at an additional charge, I want to say in the $15-$20 range. None of us opted for the upgrade and quite frankly didn't need to. Excursions: We have been to the area many times (even bought some property there) so didn't feel the need to hire a tour guide. We had two newbies with us so rented a car from Budget at The Reef to take them around to some of the sights. This is where my only complaint comes in. I went down to the lobby to reserve the rental the day before we needed it. We needed something for 6 people and car res lady says we could get a minivan for $100/day or a midsize for $40. She assured me we could get 6 in the midsize and showed me a picture of the car, looked doable. Okay I'll save the $60, give me the mid size. It was not even close to the the car in the picture and we had to have one sit on a lap. Car was old and in bad shape, we couldn't get over a Tope at any speed without bottoming out. We did have a bunch of laughs throughout the day about the \"Tin Box\" so a memory was made.:) I had also specifically told her we needed the car by 8:00am as we had a Dive scheduled in Akumal for 9:00am. No problem she says. Nobody showed until 8:30 and we weren't on the road until 8:45 so missed our Dive. I understand this is Mexico but was really looking forward to that Dive. Went to the Tulum Ruins which the newbies enjoyed very much. Get there early (9:00am to avoid the crowds and the heat. Then to Akumal Bay to snorkel with the Turtles. Saw many turtles and looks like the reef there is recovering nicely. Great place for first time snorkelers as it is a easy walk into the water from the Beach. Rented Lounge Chairs at Lol Ha for $6 each and brought a collapsible Cooler full of beer to save a few $$$$. Lol Ha still got there share in \"Girly Drinks\" throughout the day. Parking was by the hour but was fair, I think it was about $5 for most of the day. From there we went to Puerto Aventuras for Dinner at Gringo Daves, excellent Fish Taco's. GF also did a Cenote Dive and Bull Shark Dive. I don't dive with no Bull Sharks and am not particularly fond of being underwater where I can't escape if there is a problem (claustrophobia) so she was on her own. The rest of us headed to Cozumel for the day. Ferries run on the hour every hour and we rented a car from Isis Rentadora (very nice lady). Spent 1/2 the day at the Money Bar snorkeling and the other 1/2 at Coconuts on the East Side of the Island. I love Cozumel!!!! In closing, yes I would recommend The Reef Playacar for those that aren't looking for the Wow factor of some All Inclusives. It is clean, great location for walking into town and the staff were exceptional to a person. Every single staff member we came across were friendly and courteous. Of course the beach is outstanding as well. Personally I'm not liking what Playa Del Carmen has become. It has gotten much too busy for my liking. Maybe if we spent more time on the North End I wouldn't feel that way but we will be heading further South for our future visits to the area, Akumal and Tulum.", "Date": "December 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Maine", "Title": "\u201cAVOID- Head South For Akumal or Tulum!\u201d", "Author": "NJ1980", "ReviewID": "UR89156971", "Content": "We were supposed to stay at this hotel for 9 nights and left after 4. The hotel is set in a nice jungle/garden setting, but the town of Playa del Carmen is so over developed now that you might as well stay in Cancun, rather drive an hour. This was my third time to this area and sadly, I wound never go back. The city is being ripped apart and in Mexico, that means lots of traffic, unclear street signs and caios. Going for a drive and even a walk through town a nightmare. There are also lots of police cars just waiting to pull you over and take your money. This happended to us twice. Another reason why I'd avoid this town now. From the start, we found this resort to be very unrelaxing. The front desk clerk told us to check in with the concierge to schedule our \"welcome to the hotel tour\" for first thing the next day. We were told this was to show us around...after we signed up and I read the fine print on the paper, it said this was a sales pitch for relstate. I promptly called the front desk and cancelled. Again, nothing was as it seems there and you are always on high alert to pay attention to everything. The room was ok. The bed was ok. There was a leek in the ceiling in the bathroom, but not a big deal. The biggest problem was you could never have enough drinking water. They stock your room fridge with cans of soda, but bottle water for drinking and brushing teeth was always a challenge! All the rooms were very dark and had a garden view. The food was TERRIBLE and I think thats what finally did it for me. Everyday the same tasteless slop and after 4 days of crappy meals, your body feels terrible. Breakfast was ok, at least you had fresh fruits and the french toast was yummy. Lunch and dinner, oh buy, where do I start?! The food had no flavor! The alfredo sauce for pasta was like tasteless white liquid, the tomato sauce was ok, cause it was literally just crushed tomatos out of a can- hard to mess that up... but the salad dressings were weird, the Ranch was like a vinegrette and was sour, same with the thgousand island dressing. All the desserts were tastless, except the flan, which was ok. Everything was just not good, not tasty and blah...the snack bar had pizza, but again it was like cardboard! After 4 days of chips, quacamole and quesadillas, you are over it! The beach was ok, not as nice as the Tulum beach we wound up going to which was amazing....the bars again were so-so but not a very good alcohol selection and we felt nauseous after 2 drinks...Very difficult to get drinking water..My advice is skip this hotel, skip this town....you want a resort? Stay in Cancun. Its already developed and close to the airport. You want to see the real Rivera Maya, or what's left of it? Head south to Akumal or Tulum. Beaches are beautiful, towns are quiet but they have many beautiful beach bungalows and best of all, food is YUMMY and has flavor!! For the price we paid at this all inclusive in Playa del Carmen, we spent almost the same amount renting a place on the beach and eating basically whatever we wanted and didn't have to be surrounded by caios and annoying tourists.", "Date": "December 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Collingwood, Canada", "Title": "\u201cPerfect all-inclusive, small and clean clean clean!\u201d", "Author": "Karen-cheek", "ReviewID": "UR88700131", "Content": "Wow, so much better than any mega-hotels.

Don't get me wrong there were some things I would have liked to be better which includes the room. We stayed in a basic room on the first floor which was right near the main path to get to the beach, pools and everything else so there was no privacy at all, we didn't keep the curtains open at all because everyone walking by would have seen everything. The room was small and needed a desperate update but although it was a bit of an issue for us we usually don't spend a lot of time in the room so it was not that big of a deal. The grounds were absolutely beautiful and we truly enjoyed walking through them all the time, it was a really nice rain forest feel and the grounds are kept immaculate! The beach was beautiful and the chairs, umbrella's and beds were plentiful. We stayed in a resort last year in Cancun that you had to be out at 5am to put your towel down on a chair to save it, this was not a problem here. This resort is small but in a good way. The buffet was pretty good as were the two restaurants, the walk to Playa del Carmen is about 15 minutes and a cab was 50 pesos if you didn't want to walk, which is pretty good to me. I loved the ice cream parlor (as did my 11 year old son and 3 year old nephew) and the coffee/tea service, they were both in beautiful settings. The employees work so hard and there were a couple that were just so wonderful, unfortunately I don't remember their names. One thing I want to add is PLEASE TIP!!!! I know this is all inclusive but if your lazy butt does not feel like getting off your chair from the beach to go to the bar and get something and you ask one of the employees to do it for you, you absolutely should tip them something. We saw so much of people not tipping and actually being rude about it, these people work very hard and $1 is not a big deal to part with. There really is no nightlife but that wasn't something we needed since we were traveling with kids.

All, breakfast, lunch and dinner had a nice choice of Mexican food, always fresh salads/vegetables and fruits and a nice dessert buffet. Having the option to eat at the 2 restaurants (you have a wide choice of food, which is included in the 'all inclusive' offer, though you can get wine or certain dishes for an additional price as well, if you wish) makes it even more varied. We just had positive experiences with the staff in the restuarants, the bars and the entertainment staff, the cocktails were good and Jesus from the poolbar already had the drinks ready for us when arriving ( a little tipping of course does not hurt, but cocktails are also good without tipping :)). The beach is just beautiful with a lot of sunbeds and the 2 pools also have a lot of sunbeds available. During the day you could have icecream at the ice cream parlour or you could have tea and coffee in the tropical gardens. The hotel is perfectly located directly at the beach and a short walk (the best on the beach) to Playa del Carmen, or you can go by taxi for 50 Pesos.

Air conditioner is good with a remote control, good luck figuring it out. The very pathetic bad: First day, very minimal to nothing for a hot water shower. Called the front desk on Sunday, no action. Called Monday and demanded service immediately, two maintenance men showed up in 30 seconds, ran the water and said, there it is, there what is ? Luke not even warm water, they shrugged their should and that was it, nothing fixed, in comparison to my friends showers, they where all cold and hardly warm at all. So we had cold showers all week, the guests at the RIU next door had boiling hot showers. The one thing that made me really mad was the lobby bar. I got a free espresso (as expected) upon arrival on the Sat. then Sun the machine broke, and Monday morning there was a brand new machine, but when we went to ask for an espresso, the bartender said, \" Oh sorry senior, that is an extra 25 pesos. Extra !!!! we just spent over $1,500 to go to this \"all inclusive rip off\" and they want the guests to pay for their machine ? how pathetic is that. So we walked down to Starbucks instead. I hope the management have saved up a good stockpile of pesos wisely as millions of potential customers read this review and think of booking elsewhere, how cheap can you get, bad decision people, really bad !!! Then there was the Cenote lounge, open for barely an hour or so in the afternoon, oh and of course all the booze being offered that was extra as well, wow woopee, not at the RIU. hint hint. Went to the Botticelli Ala carte on Friday, we were asked to leave and come back 45 min to an hour later as they did not have enough staff to serve us, how bout NO, the stupid thing is, we went back to the Le Terazza grill restaurant and there was a huge amount of staff wandering around, with maybe 4 customers, why did they not simply take some of those waiters and put them in the Botticelli ???? its not brain surgery people !!!!!! The safe's in the rooms are all .......here it comes.......EXTRA, wow what a surprise This resort is a definite 2 star at best.

It might not be to everyone's liking as much as it was to my wife and I however. Those looking for a 'super sized' resort will find it lacking for some of the variety found in the neighbouring huge properties that we find quite 'plastic' in comparison. The staff was one of the unexpected highlights of the trip. This was our first holiday in Mexico, although we have travelled extensively throughout much of the world. The Mexican staff were sincere, cheerful and friendly, each and every one of them. They were very understanding of our lack of Spanish and were always helpful in making sure we were understood. The food was very good at all locations, for all meals. There are two a la carte restaurants, unfortunately one was undergoing renovations during our stay, but did reopen for the last two nights. The a la carte dinners were excellent and the service was very professional and personable. The house wine wasn't great, but the wine list has good variety for reasonable prices. The main dining area was clean, pleasant and comfortable. The food variety was very good with a wide variety of fresh fruit at all meals, plus a salad bar. I suspect at the larger hotels there would be a greater variety of eating options, but for a smaller resort, our opinion was that they tried very hard and succeeded in giving good variety. Our room was very clean and although possibly a bit basic in some respects, very comfortable. We slept very soundly and found the beds to be excellent. Not sure if this is the same in all rooms, but we had a choice of three types of pillows, so hopefully anyone should be comfortable. In our opinion, the grounds of the hotel are superlative and far better than any of the surrounding hotels we saw. I would suggest potential visitors to The Reef Playacar check out the photos of the grounds to make sure this is to their liking, but everyone we talked to while there, loved it. There was a wedding on the beach while we were there and the staff did an excellent job of setting up for what appeared to be a very enjoyable time for everyone. As others have mentioned, the nightlife is not the reason to go to this resort. The town of Playa del Carmen is nearby (fifteen minute walk or short cab ride), so anyone wanting to party has no excuse not to, although the drinks wouldn't be free. We met a number of young families who loved the resort and they found no need to leave for their entire trip. The gym is well equipped and maintained. The event staff was fun and very friendly. We had a feeling of complete safety while on the grounds and in town as well. There is a small but excellent bird sanctuary about a eight minute walk from the resort with flamingoes, egrets, peacocks, parrots and toucans, although it costs US$22, the wrist band is good for the entire week. Make sure to bring a camera with a telephoto lens. We would gladly go back tomorrow if we could, but hope to return some day before too long. Being first time visitors to the Yucatan, we were amazed by the clean white sand and the warm, clear blue water.

That being said, there are a few highs and lows about the resort we would like to share. Highs: Outstanding scenery and landscaping, beautiful beach, amazing staff who were always friendly and attentive to needs. Food was excellent in all areas (snack bar, chulavista, terraza grill) although the a-la-carte restaurants had the same menu day in and day out. Lows: Small, basic \"holiday inn\" type room with a very hard mattress and pillows. Bathroom was very small with only one sink (although we're not sure if the upgraded rooms had different bathrooms) Rooms and surrounding buildings need a facelift, as they seem outdated. The best part about the rooms were the balconies. Of the 2 a-la-carte restaurants, one was closed for renovations, and the only one open served as both with menus alternating from day to day, leaving only half of the availability for those looking for a nice meal experience. In addition to the above mentioned, we also were disappointed in the EXTREME LACK OF NIGHTLIFE. We knew going in that there was no disco on site, however the place was a ghost town after 10:00pm. In order to have some dancing and music, you either make your own fun with an iPOD and a lot of drinks, or you go with the Sport and Entertainment staff to one of the local bars in Playa Del Carmen (coco bongo, Senior frogs) however that will cost you an extra $45.00us. Actually, there were many items that were an additional cost: wine with dinner(except house), $15usd/day for premium booze, $40usd/pp for private beach dinner, $50usd/pp for lobster dinner(only 1/2 lb), in-room safe $2/day. However for a mere $5/day tip to our day and night bartenders, we received amazing service, never waited, given drinks others were not, worth it!!! Overall, we would most likely not come back, but if there is a good deal, then we would reconsider that thought.

I went to the lobby to try to fix the problem, and was told that no king size wasn't available till next day, I dint wanted to star my vacation on a bad note so we said OK, and was told to come back the next morning at ten am. we left everything in our luggage knowing we were going to move the next day. next morning went to the lobby and a different guy was there he dint know anything about us our what we requested, we almost had a pissing match with him about how long I book our stay, and inform him that I was told to come back the next day for my king size room, he told me that hell have a room for us tomorrow!! I ask to talk to his supervisor and he pretended to check his computer for a minute and then told me to come back at one pm and get the key for the new room , go figure. When we moved to the new room I had to carry all my luggage to the other room! I guess it was my fault for not calling them to help us, and they did try to help but because there was some items out of our luggage they dint wanted to touch it , that was nice of them. We regretted switching because the king mattress was so hard that we were so sore in the morning what a disappointment. so stay whit your double bed they are more comfortable, the other issue we had , we had two towels and I guess we had them past the time of returning them! common we are on vacation we are not there to keep time of towels,I went to turn them in at the towel shack and be cause I was past the time I had to walk to the lobby and turn them in there, so I dint be charge, I was at one end of the hotel hat to walk all the way to the other side what a waste of my time I told the guy at lobby why I had to bring this towels all the way to them! and he said that was there policy, I said cant a phone call from the person at the shack be enough?? of course i was wrong!! oh!! and its slippery when it rains all they have to do is put down rugs on the most dangerous spots .at the buffet you can feel electricity on the soup pots if you are wet!! a few mats thats all to take care of the slippery floors. the snack bar hours are not true they suppose to be open from 6-2am nope close at 7pm??? I ask one employee why? he said be cause it was low season and they dint have enough help!! I'm from mexico living in USA for a long time I new going to mexico I shouldn't expect allot but common it's all common sense. that keeps you from getting better reviews. hope this will help other travelers to mexico or this resort. no pool sports very little or no entertainment from the staff at the pools, its up to you if you want to have fun, food is great,shows are good, rooms are good , the bed no good!!! will I go back hmm!! knowing what I know now, maybe......", "Date": "October 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cFANTASTIC!!!!\u201d", "Author": "body_candy", "ReviewID": "UR84484930", "Content": "To returned to Australia from our stay at The Reef Playacar, we were only there for 1 week after being in Orlando for 2 weeks and i wish we had made it longer as we had a fantastic time there.

We absolutely loved it! We had booked via Expedia, and ended up with 2 separate beds instead of the one King as we had reserved. But after two nights they were able to get us moved. Since we went during their slow season, the hours of the various food/beverage stations were different than what was listed. And the two nicer restaurants upstairs-they alternated which one was open each night, rather than getting to choose between the two. All of this was ok, we had read reviews from during slow season. And we sure didn't go hungry!! Most of the time we dined at the buffet. We thought they did a really good job working with what they had. There were items each time of day that were the same, but they always had new additions at each meal. The desserts were great too. Do not leave out in your room anything with sugar. The ants are sure to come and help themselves. They are tiny, not much of a bother, and there is nothing the hotel could possibly do about them. But they do love the sugar. Tip your bartender if you want to get any kind of buzz. Or don't and just stand there asking for more. We gave $20 to the bartender one night and he took care of us the rest of the evening without us having to ask. The shows are good, some a little cheesy, but it's not like you are buying tickets to broadway. These people work 6 days a week and all day at the resort already. I don't know where they find the time to practice for the evening shows. We went out with the entertainment crew one night to the Brahma Club. It was fun and we felt safe. Luis (sports and entertainment guy) did a great job at communicating what is custom, and never left our side. Location-perfect location and hotel if you don't want to be in a mega resort. The resort looks just like all the pictures I had seen. We got exactly what we expected. It was a 15 minute walk to downtown, the beach was absolutely gorgeous and loaded with shells. Tips: For excursions, take the ADO bus. It will save you tons of money. We went to Tulum and it only cost us $8 each round trip. You just have to walk into town to catch the bus. Bought our admission tickets when we got there. Timeshare shpeel-We did sit through the \"investment\" presentation on the first morning. We were promised a tshirt and massage.

Bartenders (Roberto!). Restaurant staff, at both the buffets and a la carte. The Reef Marina - the best dive shop in Playa. Some of the buffet food was excellent. Italian a la carte restaurant was excellent. The Bad: Beds were very hard and uncomfortable. Lock on the room safe was extra. Minibar/fridge not restocked. Pesos mysteriously disappearing from the room. Room was clean, but otherwise unremarkable. Some food was cold. Some food was obviously leftover/reheated (I'm ok with that sometimes, but deep fried breakfast hash browns don't really work on their 2nd day on the buffet - turn into grease bricks). Children and babies (with and without diapers) in the pool with the Pool Bar. The Ugly: Upon arrival, our assigned \"concierge\" offered drinks, bag assistance, and then the pressure conversation into the Time Share presentation. When I asked directly if the morning meeting was a timeshare presentation, I was told no, that it was simply a guided tour of the facilities. Signed a form to reserve the spot. Upon reading the form in detail back at the room, it was in fact a Timeshare presentation they were doing. I spoke with the \"concierge\" on duty and was told that our assigned man would get into trouble if we cancelled, and that I would have to tell him about the cancellation personally. Good luck with that! LOL. What a low sales tactic. This left an extremely bad taste in my mouth - a very unfortunate way to start our vacation, and enough to turn me off of the hotel, pretty much completely. I spent my vacation diving, so the excellent team at The Reef Marina made up for many of the shortcomings of the hotel. If I were to say at the Reef Playacar again, the dive team would be the only reason. I'd more likely stay at a nearby hotel and walk to the Reef Marina.

The worst part was the owful time we had when we arrived and someone named Erik tried desperately to sell us a Vacation Club. I've been in hotels in 12 countries in 4 continents, and had never been subjected to such a determined attempt to sell us something we didn't want. When you arrive to a hotel after a long plane journey, you want to go to your room as fast as possible, not to hear a speech trying to sell you something. I think they try to sell you the vacation club, and all other sort of tours, in the first few hours you're there, because you're tired, your defenses are low, you just want to get rid of them and maybe even you buy them something just to be left alone. In the next 24 hours, we received calls in our room from no less than 6 different people, trying to deceive us, purporting to be 'the local representation of your travel agent' or things like that, trying to sell us something. It didn't stop until I actually insulted the Nth. guy that called, furious about the whole issue. After that, nobody else called, in the whole week we stayed there. The hotel should protect their paying guests from all these people, instead of actively collaborating with them. (they should not have my name and my room number, in the first place).

Our stay was seven wonderful days long, I only wish we could have stayed longer. Based on the reasonable price of the trip, I was nervous from the time I booked. I\u2019ve stayed at 5 other all inclusive resorts and this one what certainly measured up to the rest. The Hotel Lobby- I won\u2019t lie, this was the most obnoxious part of the trip. Don\u2019t judge this hotel by the appearance of the front desk like I did at first. It might scare you, but it\u2019s just a front desk and could it use some updating-most definitely. Check-in was fine, a little slow but not terrible. The concierge was intertwined with a timeshare pitch. We politely said we weren\u2019t interested, several times and eventually the pressure stopped. I understand it\u2019s their jobs to do it, but it\u2019s probably in the best interest of the hotel to separate the concierge from the timeshare pitch. It can come across as deceiving. The Resort- As a whole the resort was beautiful. Well kept, maintained and clean. The bell boys and maintenance staff work their butts off to keep it this way. Wildlife is everywhere and it\u2019s so nice to stay at a non-commercialized place like this. Iberostar and Riu are nice, but the feel of the Reef was much different, in a good way. I like to compare it to going out to dinner at a Olive Garden vs. a family owned Italian restaurant-I prefer the one of a kind types of places and the Reef is just that. The Beach- Gorgeous! Perfection! Almost no seaweed to be found and if any was found it was taken care of by the most hard working staff ever! Please get them a wheel barrel and proper rakes. Had working people! The waves were calm the first 4 days and the last three days they were wild and there was the best boogie boarding imaginable. The Pools- The Pool with the swim up bar was fun but crowded, the bar needs a few bartenders, but the one who was working was working very hard. The activities Pool was one pool I preferred when I wasn\u2019t soaking up the beautiful beach. I think I played more sports and games during my stay at the Reef than I ever have in all of my other vacations combined. Water Polo, Volleyball, Water Aerobics, etc\u2026 What a fun time we had with the Reef Activities Staff-they were one of the most enjoyable parts of our stay. It was like having an additional 10 friends on our trip with us. Luis, Leonardo and all others were just great! The Entertainment- The shows were great, the staff consisted of some very talented dancers and performers. The casino night was fun! The karaoke nights were AWESOME! Special thanks to Leonardo De Costa for making that happen. He was so accommodating to our group and made it more fun than I could have imagined. The Bars- The best bar was definitely the bar upstairs on the roof/patio. Jesus M. was the best bartender I\u2019ve ever met in Mexico, and I\u2019ve been five times. He played great music and made fun drinks, always made a point to check up on us, say hi. He was wonderful! The Restaurants- The food at the buffet was good. The woman making the omelets was amazing-tip her\u2026she deserves it. I wish I could have brought her home with me. I woke up starving and craving one of her omelets for a week after our vacation. All of the wait staff and hosts are very funny and made dinner more fun than typical dining. The food was good, I ate everything on both menus. But I was really wishing for Mexican. Oh well, Italian and Gourmet was good too. The Location- Great spot, so close to Playa del Carmen. We walked there once via the beach and spent an afternoon there. It was a long day, take a cab back. WE took a cab to town a few nights, had a great time at the Parrot Club and a few other places. The Rooms- Nice, clean. Ask for a King size bed if you\u2019re traveling with your spouse. My boyfriend and I got two full size beds, which we thought was very small for both of us. We didn\u2019t ask to be moved because the bell boy had already ran back and forth a few times to get us settled in, we felt bad. Don\u2019t drink the wine in your room unless you want to pay for it. We got bamboozled into those charges. We tried to debate it upon check out, but lost that battle. Even if it says complimentary, it doesn\u2019t really mean its free\uf04a Excursions- We chose the Tulum Extreme Adventure which was the best excursion I\u2019ve ever been on in my life. Zip lining, Rappelling, Swimming in a Cenote, Snorkeling in Caves, Exploring the ruins in Tulum and swimming at the infamous Tulum beach! The BEST!!!!! I highly recommend. The Weather- Perfect. A little rain here and there, but almost a perfect week of sunshine! Overall-the place was awesome. I\u2019d go back in a heartbeat.

There is a bar about 20 steps up from the beach with a great bartender. Also, the beach is very accessible at night. I read a review that said there was a guard on the beach that asked for money or denied access at night. That is not true at all. There was no one there at any point during our week and I'm pretty sure I could have slept on the beach if I wanted to. Food - The restaurants are excellent. They really make you feel like you're at a top notch restaurant thanks to the setting and very attentive service. The food is also very good. (Guys - They do expect slightly better than \"I'm on vacation\" clothes. I saw them turn away people because they were in shorts. But I was in nice jeans and shoes, so you don't need to get too fancy.) The buffet is very good for breakfast and lunch, and not bad for dinner. The snack bar had great burgers and is good for grabbing some food and taking it down to the beach. Bars - I don't think you need to upgrade your package to top shelf liquors unless you're very picky. Beers that are included are tecate and dos equis. I recommend asking for cans of these two. The cans last while you can get them, but that usually ends up being most of the day. Your other option is to bring your own mug. They serve their drinks in plastic cups (I really don't like my beer out of anything plastic). Their cups also have a slight soapy smell/taste (but it really isn't as bad as the reviews below.) The bartenders had great personalities. The guy that works at the nighttime bar was fantastic and by the second night had my mojitos made for me before I even got up to the bar to ask him for another. Rooms - The rooms looked better than the pictures led us to believe. Air conditioning worked a little too well. I woke up a couple times looking for a blanket. You can even set them to an exact temperature. The rooms were very clean. A maid came everyday. Nothing was stolen from our room (I even left a dollar sticking out just to see if it would be taken.) However, we kept our valuables and money locked in our luggage. A lock costs a dollar or two - it's always good to bring one along. The beds were a little stiff, but nothing horrible. Staff - The staff was probably my favorite part about this place (aside from the beach and included alcohol, of course). We didn't pass a single worker throughout the grounds without having a friendly \"hola\" sent our way. They loved joking around with us when they got a chance and were very eager to serve the guests. They are very hard working people. You'll see the same waiters early at breakfast, lunch, and then late at dinner. The person you got your towels from on the beach at 10am is often performing at a show at 10pm at night. So be sure to TIP. Tipping a dollar here and there can make your stay even more pleasurable. That dollar or two also means a whole lot more to those hard working people than it does to you. Also, most of them speak a lot of English, but if you want to try out your Spanish, they seem to really appreciate it...don't be afraid. -Water - I drink a lot of water so I was worried about Montezuma's Revenge. You get 2 large bottles in your room daily, and you can get bottles of water at the bars. Also, the bar by the beach has a water cooler of fresh water. I got a couple extra bottles at the bars and kept them in our fridge. I never went thirsty. Also, we brushed/rinsed with the water and never got sick. None of the food got us sick either, including some raw veggies and fish. I may just have a stronger system than some others. Overall, I had one of the best vacations of my life. If I do Mexico again, I'd definitely go back to the Reef. I have no complaints other than the heat, and there isn't much anyone can do about that. Oh - Snorkeling is only 30 dollars a person for a 45mins-hour long swim in a really pretty coral reef. It's definitely worth it!", "Date": "August 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cbeautiful resort, terrible management\u201d", "Author": "frgnadorbl1977", "ReviewID": "UR72916270", "Content": "this is a copy of the letter i sent to management at the reef when i got home. we spent a full week at the resort with a group of 10, from 7/18-7/24. we arrived very happy, and left quite disappointed. we have already gone through our travel agent for a partial refund. also know that when i sent this to management, i received an email the next day that said this was received and that i would have a response shortly. i have not heard from them yet. it has been 4 days. \"I wanted to write and let you know what a great time we had on our vacation last week! My husband and I did not receive the bottle of champagne that you had promised, but that was not a problem at all. We had a wonderful time with our group of friends that traveled with us! The grounds are absolutely beautiful, the pool was great, the food was fantastic, and the employees were always ready to take care of anything we needed! Obviously there were some minor problems, but the positives FAR outweighed the negatives, so I will simply look past them! That is what my review would have been until Thursday. My husband told several employees that there was a loose board on the bridge in the back of the lobby area outside the gift shop. Nothing was done about this board, and on Thursday, he fell through it because of the negligence of the staff. When he spoke to the manager on duty (Rafael Laguna) before we left yesterday (since your note said he could follow up with him), he was simply told that no one said anything. We would have loved to have this resolved before we left yesterday, but it was clear that there was no way to come to an agreement for compensation. A massage over bruises is unacceptable. I just wanted to give you a heads-up about my review so it\u2019s not shocking. I also want to let you know that there will be 9 more that are quite similar, as this injury did put quite a damper on the end of 10 people\u2019s vacations. My new review is as follows: When we arrived, we were not bombarded by the time share nonsense, as many people have complained of. We checked into our room, which was nice and cool. We went to eat at the buffet, which was ok\u2026but we were not there for the food. We immediately hit the beach. As we looked down the beach, many in our group of 10 thought that we definitely had the best looking resort on the beach, and I had to agree! Tuesday our room was never cleaned, we did not get water, and did not get towels. I called the front desk at 4, and was told someone would be right over. At 7, my husband called again. When someone finally showed up, he still had to ask for towels. At one point during the day, my husband told an employee that a board was loose on the main path out of the lobby building. On Wednesday, I went to the front desk and let them know that one of the lights in my bathroom was out, and that it was collecting water and leaking. I was told that someone would be sent to fix it. On Saturday when we left, no one had been in to look at the light, and it was still dripping water on the back of whoever was sitting on the toilet at the time. Wednesday again, my husband let another staff member know about the loose board. Thursday we went on an excursion to XPLOR, which is something I highly recommend! We had an absolute blast! When we got back to the resort, we were walking down the steps in back when my husband went through the very board he had mentioned to several employees on several occasions was loose. Not only was the board not replaced when he first told them it was loose, but it wasn\u2019t even marked with a caution cone or anything. The board snapped in half, he scraped his entire calf on the way down, and hit his knee on a board which left a huge bruise. This left him in pain and limping for the remainder of our vacation. Up until this incident, I looked past any other problem we\u2019d had during the week. The drinks were great, the staff was nice, the food was good (I encourage anyone to eat at the restaurants for dinners\u2026AMAZING), the grounds are beautiful\u2026couldn\u2019t say enough nice stuff about this resort. But when my husband fell, the management denied that there was a problem, denied that he was told they knew of the problem, and offered him a massage on top of his bruises to compensate for his injury as a result of their negligence. At the beginning of my vacation planning, I had seen MANY negative reviews of the Reef. I contacted management and was given the name and website of the company that is responsible for their health and safety checks. They were wonderful to work with, and we all decided to give it a chance. Though in hindsight, it seems that Reef management will do what they can and need to do to get your business, but once something happens, you\u2019re on your own. Until Thursday I would have recommended this resort to anyone I knew looking for a great time on a budget, but I can\u2019t in good conscience do that anymore.\"", "Date": "July 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cby far the worst vaction i had so far..\u201d", "Author": "jessica26_10", "ReviewID": "UR72501243", "Content": "i was so dissapointed by the service of staff at the reef.

We had read great reviews. We are early 30's and just wanted to relax. The resort is small and beautiful. There are lots of trees and bushes. The staff was friendly. There is alot to say so I broke it down-- Location: We loved that the resort was in a safe gated community near 5th Ave. We walked to 5th Ave one day... it is just a 20 min walk up the street. We felt safe the entire time. We took a cab in the evening. Cab fare from the resort to 5th Ave is a flat rate of 5 bucks. Free entertainment: The resort has things you can use for free, such as snorkel gear, kayaks, books to read, boogie boards, bikes and hobie cats. We used the bikes and they gave us a lock so we could lock up the bikes if we wanted to shop. The bikes were not new but it was a nice way to explore the area. We also used the hobie cat. It's like a mini sail boat. We went and asked to use it several times. The guy working at the stand asked if we knew how to use it and we said no. He told us that since we had no experience using it then we can't use it without a taking a $25 lesson. We left and came back the next day. This time we told a different guy that we had done it before. They told use we could use it in 30 minutes because someone was getting a lesson. So we came back in 30 minutes. Then they said that they had another lesson and we would have to come back again. Eventually we got to use the hobie cat and it was really fun. The best part is that there is a flyer in the room that stated the hobie cat is free and the a staff would be a happy to give you a quick lesson for free. If you want to use it tell them you have done it before but it has been a long time. They will show you how to use it... you don't have to be smart to do it...it's easy. Food: The food was not bad. I thought it was as good as any of the other places that my husband and I have stayed in Cancun. This was our 3rd trip to Canun/Rivera Maya. Our only complaint was that there was only one buffet and two resturants that are open at night.The steak place was pretty good. I liked my steak. We wish there had been more choices. The buffet seemed to have alot of the same stuff for each meal. There was a snack bar but all they had during the day was nachoes, fries, hot dog and hamburger. I felt that I ate alot of the same stuff all the time. The lady working the snack bar worked in slow motion. We spent alot of time waiting for the food. The line was not long but she would grill one burger/hot dog at a time instead of finding out if several people waiting wanted the same thing and prepared them together. Ocean: The beach was gorgeous. Awesome beach. There were good sized waves and it was not rocky at all once you were past the spot where the waves rush the shore. Pool: There were 2 good sized pools. I didn't think they were over crowded. Drinks: We had no problem getting drinks at the bar. The drinks were tasty. Sometimes it took a few minutes but we never had to wait a long time. Rooms: Rooms were clean. Air conditioner worked great. The king size bed was hard. My husband loved that. I thought it was a decent size room. No ocean view but the rooms are all located between the lobby and the pools/ocean. You don't have to walk far to get to the pool or ocean. We got there at 12:30pm and the room wasn't ready... they gave us our bracelet, stored our luggage and pointed us to the food. We came back an hour later and the room was ready. Overall the resort was good. We liked the small feel of the resort. The trip was super cheap so we didn't expect Ritz Carlton service and rooms.There were alot of famlies. Sometimes the kids were annoying but we didn't chose adults only so we accepted it as part of the package. The resort was great for the price and we had a good vacation. We are not picky and just wanted to relax on a good beach.", "Date": "July 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisville, Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cOverall a great place but ....\u201d", "Author": "KYtraveler48", "ReviewID": "UR69558247", "Content": "Stayed at the reef June 24 through July 1 2010. Was there with my partner. Overall we had a great time. The review is a little skewed because while there Tropical Storm/Hurricane Alex came through which affected the weather most of the time we were there. Here it goes: Hotel: The resort was very cool witth the jungle settling. It was well maintained and clean. The layout was nice with lots of interesting plants and gardens. Due to all the rain from the storm the resort was extremely slippery (ttile floors) just about everywhere and several people fell. The walk to the ice cream was especially treacherous. Room: Our room was pretty basic. Had two double beds and we would have preferred a King bed. We had a third floor room overlooking the interior jungle setting and the cool deck in the middle. It was like being in a tree house. The AC worked fine and room was always nice an cool. The beds were frim but I thought they were comfortable. The bathroom could use a little updating but was fine. Tub/shower had a window you could look out over the jungle. Maid service was good, and always had 2 new bottled waters everyday. Pools: There were two pools, both of which were nice. Preferred the upper pool that had a great pool bar. Didn't care for the activities too much in lower pool area, but think if you had kids they would like it. Due to hight winds most people were at pools so chairs were a little scarce. There was a hot tub by the lowere pool but several people told us it didn't work and wasn't hot so we never went in it. Towel service was fine. One thing I thought was a little odd was that the baby/kids pool was right next to the pool bar. The Pool bar was best place to hang out and meet people. Beach: Beach was awesome!! Very wide and soft sand. This is by far the best part of the resort. If you walk down beach to the south you pass other resorts then nothing but jungle and beach which was very cool. If you walked south you walke past condo/homes and ruins and hit Playa Del Carmen. The ocean was very rough. I thought it was a blast but am a strong swimmer. It really beat you up which was fun!! I am told this was very abnormal and the ocean is normally fairly calm. Drinks: Drinks were a bit dissappointing. Mixed drinks were weak (I like a stiff drink). I tried ordering doubles but that didn't work so would order a drink and a shot and add the shot to it. Frozen drinks were delicious but again weak in my opinion. The beer was draft beer and was only one kind. It was fine but glasses could have been larger. Sometimes you could get beer in a can but was warm so stuck to draft beer. We were told that the room fridge was stocked with beer but it wasn't. They put a couple in there when we arrived but when we called for more they brought one more beer for the entire week for two people. We finally just bought some been in town and stocked the fride ourselves and those ice cold beers in a can were by far the best we had at the resort. We did love the Mimosa and Bloody Mary bar at breakfast! You made your own which was nica as could make it how you liked it. Bars: The pool bar was by far the best bar. Felix the bartender worked very hard and was fantastico. There was another bar by the snack bar that we used for beach beers. It was still a bit of a hike to get a drink if you were at the beach. A beach bar would have been nice. The lobby bar was a bit dull. The bartender there didn't seem too happy. Plus I don't like watching people leave from theri vacation which is sad. lol. We did use the lobby bar a fair amount as it was close to our room. Finally the bar upstairs could have been really cool under the large plapa but again was a little dull. A dance floor or kareoke would have been fun. Bar stools around the bar would have been great! Food: Mainly ate at the buffet which was Great!! The snack bar was also great. Cheeseburgers and the fries were very very good. There was a cool area above the snack bar that we ate in one day but it seemed to be closed off most of our trip. It overlooked the ocean with larg glass windos and had outside table. Didn't seem like it was being put to good use. It was a great area if they would open it up. We went up there during one of the downpours. Not sure if we were supposed to be there. Went to the italian restaurant one night, Bochellis I think. It was very nice but my filet was the worst piece of meat I have ever had. It was unchewable. Not sur what happeed there. My friend had fish which he said was good. We went down to the buffet to eat afterwards. Breakfast by far was the best meal!! Location: This is why we chose this place. You can walk to Playa Del Carmen either on the street or on the beach. Playa Del Carmen is an awesome town and very fun. We were there almost everyday (even during the storms). Activities: The ocean was too rough for to try the kyaks, snorkeling, windsurfing, jet skis, sail boats, etc. I would have tried them but couldn't. We did look at the tennis court on the thrid floor and it was in shambles so if you want to play tennis its not going to happen there. Negatives: My friend slipped and fell in the bathroom by the pool (floors were slick from Alex) I wasn't with him. He busted his head open and had a lot of bleeding. Workers at the hotel wrapped his head in bandages in sent him back to his room. When I got to the room we undid the bandages and he was still bleeding heavily. We went to the front desk and asked where the nearest hospital was. We were given a map and that was it. We were on our own. We don't speack much spanish. We caught a cab to an immediate care center on 20th ave and Juarez. He had severed a vein and required 5 stiches. It wa kind of scary being in a foreign country in a emergency room. My gripe is that the resort should have taken him to a doctor when discovering him covered with blood and not just wrap his head and send him back to his room. Furthermore they should have helped us get him to the emergency room rather than just give us a map. This occurred probably around 5 or 6 p.m. so it wasn't late night or anyhing. The only other negative experience is not the hotels fault but was just another extremely rude guest from Holland. There were several people there from Holland all of who were great and nice, but this one guy made it a point to be a jerk to us upon our first meeting for reasons unknown to us. We tried to avoid him for our stay but as my friend said... it just goes to show you that there are jerks in every country.", "Date": "July 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Caldwell, Idaho", "Title": "\u201cFabulous!\u201d", "Author": "TenaSunflower", "ReviewID": "UR69259396", "Content": "I absolutely loved the Jungle style grounds.

The weather was amazing, and sunny everyday. The resort was small and quaint. After reading some of the reviews before we left, I was a bit scared to see what I got myself into. Here's my breakdown: 1) Food-it was always warm and had a variety. Did it taste like \"American food\"...maybe not, but then again, we were not in the States. And I thought they did their best to try and appeal to everyone. Did I starve? No-I was always able to find something on the buffet, keeping in mind to stay away from perishable food (for those that posted they got sick, I'd like to know wha they ate). You have to think about what you're eating, and choose \"safe options\" 2) Buffet/Sit down resturants-The buffet was not air-conditioned, so towards the end of my stay, my body could not handle eating in a warm, humid enviroment. The service in the buffet area was great. Always willing to refill your water (which was bottled) and bring you a drink. We tried the Italian place once. My husband thought the steak was good. I got the vegetarian dish, and it was horrible....so I went down to the buffet later that evening. 3) Pool/Beach. The pool water was so warm! It didn't feel too refreshing. And not to mention many people at the swim up bar didn't leave that area (to use the restroom). Granted, there was plenty of chemicals in the water...but something to keep in mind. It was clean when I went in, and I saw them cleaning it every morning. Plenty of chairs and cabana beds open, and never had a problem finding an open chair. The beach was clean, and not too crowded. 4) Bar Service-Felix was our bartender while we were there....he was amazing and had great customer service. It puzzled me that he was the only one working, when clearly they could have used 2 bartenders at the pool bar. Papo's bar--the same could be said there. 2 bartenders would have been nice. A couple of times they ran out of bottled water, and didn't have more brought up...that got a bit annoying, when the least they could have done was make a call and get more. My drinks were always yummy, and I tried a good variety of them. Always service with a smile. Overall, we got what we paid for. My only downsides: 1) We ordered a room with a King bed and got a double. They said they would have a king bed available the next day, but we didn't want to hassle moving around. Still turned out ok. And yes, the beds were rock hard, but I've stayed at other resorts/hotels and they are just as bad. After a long day outside, it didn't matter, I was tired and was able to sleep just fine. 2) The staff doesn't seem to all be on the same page. We went to the Italian place, and that had a dress code. The dress code seemed to be different for each person you talked with. However, if you haggle with them, they'll let you in.

We had an amazing time and would definately return to this destination. I have been to other all inclusive resorts and thought the food at this one was by far the best! The sit down restaurants were incredible too! We were upgraded to an oceanview suite upon arrival...claiming to be \"overbooked\". It worked out nicely for us because we ended up being able to all stay together and to have a room closer to everything! I have heard so many people mention that when they arrive the hotel claims to be \"overbooked\" but I don't think that's the actual case. I think they have difficulty explaining things in English so they just say that. We did many things on this trip including going into downtown Playa Del Carmen to go shopping and also at night to the bars/clubs. We felt very safe in this area and did not have any kind of problems with scary people (as so many people warned us of before going to Mexico). We also took the ferry into Cozumel and were surprised because other than the first block or 2 which had overpriced shopping and beautiful buildings, it was fairly run down and a bit unsafe to walk in. I don't recommend going there for the day unless you take scooters to explore. We enjoyed an excursion purchased through gray line (office located right outside of the lobby door). It included off-roading in jeeps in the jungle; zip lining; swimming in a cenote; having a delicious Mayan lunch cooked for us; and also a tour of Tulum (ancient ruins). It was $99 and well worth it!! We booked our trip through Expedia and purchased the transportation as part of the package. It was well worth it because we really didn't know what to expect upon arriving. After getting there, we realized that Expedia uses a specific company \"Best Day Travel\" to do the transportation. They were extremely kind, professional, and nice! After being there for a while we felt that we could've just taken a taxi to and from the airport, however, we are glad we did so with Best Day Travel. The exchange rate of pesos to USD is a little bit different everywhere you go (restaurants etc.) I think it's generally 12.5 to 1 USD, just to give you an idea. I brought $100 in singles with me and went through almost all of them. Many vendors WILL NOT give you USD change, only pesos so be sure to bring singles!!

The resort is nicely located in so called Playacar Hotel Zone and the closest one to Playa del Carmen. 15min walk next to beautiful houses will bring you to 5th avenue full of shops, clubs, restaurants, street entertainment.... real fun. The Reef Playacar is the most beautiful resort we have even seen because it is small (5min walk from lobby to the beach), romantic and it looks like a jungle. You could touch the palm trees from your balcony and the whole resort is like that rather then massive resorts where you need shuttle (on +35C) to go anywhere. There is even a small cenote in the resort next to ice cream place. Really nice. The staff is also amazing and hard working. Of course they work for tip but you don't have to tip them in order to get service, you can tip them once you get the excellent service. You can tell they are working hard under really hot Mexican conditions but still really positive which makes you feel good. Entertainment staff is also really friendly and good, working from 10am exercise by the pool until 9pm show and even leading people to Playa del Carmen club after that. The beach has been re-sanded completely so it is really wide now and there are no more send bags in the ocean (for the waves) so it is really nice view. Enough space for everyone and you don't have to fight for a chair. The food in the restaurant is good and there is always something nice to choose. Never heard anyone had any food poisoning or something. There are two a la carte restaurants, we visited only one and the service was amazing. No need for reservation you just show up. Besides there is snack bar (fries, burgers, wings, nachos...) open until 2am so there is no chance you can be hungry. The alcoholic drinks are not watered down which is really good so be careful...hahaha. If you have kids then Kid's club would be an interesting place for them and Claudia is doing an excellent job. Our kids loved her, so my wife an I had some moments for ourselves too. There is really nice scuba diving center in the resort ran by some French people. If you are into that they are really professional and you can feel confident and safe. As a side note we had the rent a car all the time, no problems, parking is free in front. We went to see Chitchenitza (205km from resort, tickets 11$) and Coba (110km from resort, tickets 5$), the highway is good and we felt safe to drive.

I might also add that they do seem under-staffed and they work hard. If it wasn't for the staff, I'm sure our trip would have been worse. Food at the buffet wasn't bad, you could always find something to eat, however the selection is not great. Then again you are only paying for a 3.5 star resort. Being a small resort, there was not much for 'entertainment' at night, or even any place to really take a stroll around the resort. The 'jungle' setting may have been nice at one time, however it appears the trees and shrubs have overgrown and could use some 'trimming' to allow for a little more sunshine.

The room was a 3 star standard - the beds rather hard, minibar empry and never re-filled (apparently we did not leave enough tips/.

Whenever one passed by the reception, a time share \"seminar\" was offerred, whenever one passed by the pool, the animation staff offerred diving courses - it was rather annoying - just like the loud music all over the place. The bars offerred watered down drinks - for a real drink you had to pay \"tips\" - some of the bartenders were rather unfriendly and stressed all the time.

In general the property was rather small and loud, full of people who spent most time at the bar. The food was definitely not 5 star - the choice was rather limited and tasty is something else. Luckily Playa del Carmen is very close - there are many great places to eat.

The rooms are clean, but more simple, which I am fine with. If you are looking for a laid back, easy going atmosphere, this is the place for you.

It was difficult to discern staff from employees trying to sell time shares. It could get pretty frustrating when all you wanted was advice on a good local restaurant. The room quality appears ok when you walk in, but that wears off pretty quickly. We found the bedding and mattress to be very low quality, particularly the mattress, which was well used a pillow top. The bathroom had a decent set up, but the plumbing and fixtures were pretty suspect. After a heavy rain storm we found a layer of something in our shower. I honestly don't know what it was, but my initial reaction was to ask my wife if she got sick. She assured me she did not get sick. The Reef Playacar had some very redeemable qualities which included: affordable pricing, a decent buffet with a variety of options (available for all 3 meals), a quality dinner restaurant (only one), well maintained landscaping, two large pools and close proximity to downtown (5 minute walk). All in, we felt the poor room quality and the limited dinner options did not outweigh the money we saved by staying at the Reef Playacar.

They did a Disney inspired show with my daughter , and a host of other children from the resort and were absolutely fantastic with the children.

We had a beautiful vacation at the Reef. The beach is as beautiful as the pictures, there are lots of longe chairs although some of them are broken. If you want a bed (nice) just get up early. The staff were amazing! They work so hard & such long hours, always with a smile & 'Ola'. The food was good & there was always lots of fresh fruit and a variety of dishes. Not a lot of authentic Mexican food but enough to get a taste. Make sure you go to the ala carte restaurant, mexican or Italian night, you can go every night if you want, just get there early. The service is excellent, no extra charge, just leave a good tip. If you enjoy a good glass of wine, bring your own. You can get international wines at the al a carte restaurants but at an extra charge. The service at the bars was inconsistant but the swim up bar was always good thanks to Fast Eddie! The buildings are only 3 stories tall so you feel like you are in a small community. Everything is very close. Every evening around 5pm the little oasis in the middle of the resort offers special coffees while you relax on the outdoor couches. It has a bit of a jungle feel, zen music, you get the idea.....awesome atomosphere. We attended the \"Party on the Beach\" which cost a little extra but was so nice to feel the breeze, the moonlight, the music & your feet in the sand. The entertainment was average but still very enjoyable, the entertainment staff work night & day and it can't be easy to keep things fresh. We had read other reviews that said how hard the beds were but I found them to be very comfortable and slept great! I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone. Minutes away from Playa del Carmen - walk along the beach or $5 for a cab. Beware the timeshare sales people though, not just @ the hotel but also in the town. They will promise you deals on daily excursions but only after you have sat through the sales pitch. Xplor!! We spent an awesome day the this new adventure spot just 15 minutes taxi ride from the resort. Zip lining, cenotes and all terrain vehicles. It was $99/person but worth every penny!

One key plus is that the hotel & its grounds are small. This means you don\u2019t have long walks to the beach, restaurant, etc. It also allowed us to let our kids run pretty much free. The architecture and gardens are also VERY attractive. The thick, lush vegetation gives plenty of shade and keeps the pathways very cool. There are only 2 pools, as well as a kiddies pool, but neither got crowded. In addition, they only have one buffet area, so be prepared to wait a few mins for a table in the evening. These are a couple of negatives of being in a small hotel, but the positive is the more personal attention from the staff. The hotel is very well located in Playacar, an almost traffic-free residential development sufficiently close to Playa Downtown to be walkable. We did however have problems parking our car in the hotel lot, and off-street parking is very limited. Our check-in and check-out were lightening fast and we got a free upgrade to a suite, too. The room was excellent, very comfortable bed, plasma TV, high quality d\u00e9cor, efficient air con, etc. We felt the food was better than in other hotels, though you might want to steer clear of the house wine. A part of the gardens has been turned over to an ice cream parlour, which our girls loved. The main grumble we had was the poor quality of the evening entertainment. The shows they put on were cheap looking and the bar area needs to be made more welcoming. Overall, this is a 3 star hotel that offers good rates and a good level of service.

We chose it randomly,mostly basing our desicion on price and area. It is a 15-minute walk to Playa Del Carmen - or a 10-minute bike ride ( the hotel has bikes you can borrow, included). Very convenient if you want a change of scenery, if you want to shop or eat elsewhere or go to a club. We even came back on the beach from the club one night. Service is very courteous. Most staff speaks some English, some are very good at it. And some of them also speak French. As in most resorts like this, everyone welcomes you and is happy to help. At first they were fully booked and we got a room with 2 double beds, which were a bit firm - so this matched with the previous reviews we read here. But the next day we got switched into a room with a king size bed and it was very comfortable. The rooms are clean. pretty basic but they don't feel old or over-used or anything. The room was cleaned daily and we got 2 bottles of water every day in the room. We loved our room and called it home in no time. The pictures and virtual tour on the hotel's website are a pretty good representation of what it really is like. The food was good. Nothing spectacular but everything was very tasty and there was variety. There is a smoothie bar open for breakfast. They also serve ceasars and mimosas for breakfast upon request right at the buffet. (They also have guavas - little yellow fruits- that I fell in love with and miss greatly in Canada now. try them!!!) Our only thing was coffee. If you ask for an americano, you will most likely get just drip coffee. And that's not only at the hotel, that seemed to be the case in most places. So we asked for espresso instead. That worked. And there was hot water at the self-serve coffee table so we just added that to the espresso. Crowd-wise it was mixed - mostly couples and families. And the beach is beautiful!

It's clean and safe and you can walk to town or the local \"market\" without worry! My sister in law and I couldn't get over how spotless all the public restrooms were. Americans should take a lesson from them! The grounds of the hotel were like a Mayan ruin in the jungle. Just beautiful. Pools were clean and the view at breakfast....well, I could wake up to that ever day!!! The rooms were generous compared to others we have been at. It did get damp but it was 84 degrees and humid some days. The bathrooms were a nice size also. It was nothing fancy....but very very nice! The food was very good. It does get a little repetitve after a while as we were there for 9 days. The Terazza Grill/Botticelli was a nice treat for a change and was included in the all inclusive price. I found the staff to be friendly and eager to please. (We were NEVER harassed by time share people)) I am a New Yorker and we do everything in a hurry so sometimes we couldn't wait for our coffe but that's our problem! ;) Felix at the swim up bar was \"Da Man\"!! He knew within a day what we liked and had it ready before we even asked! The only negative I have to say is regarding the nightlife and the day time activities. I have two boys 10 and 13 and they felt the staff could have done more to get things \"going\"! It may be that they are more laid back but I think they could have been a bit more enthusiastic about starting the events. There were plenty of kids but you really couldn't tell what was going on and at what time it was taking place. They didn't always adhere to the activities board. The night time was where we feel it really fell short!! There is so much potential here for more! We weren't looking to \"tear it up\" BUT something....anything to keep the guests attention would be nice. We went to the upstairs bar every night after dinner and sat talking about the potential it could have. People would come up the stairs, look around, and then go back down again. There are pool tables....Maybe a Karaoke night or music. It wouldn't take much to amp it up!! I have to give a \"shout out\" to our friend Candido. He had a Mexican Pottery station next to the pool where you could paint your own or buy what he had already painted. He sat for hours patiently painting and helping the kids paint.

I will start with the \"negatives\"; The food at the buffet is often warm, at best (except for breakfast) The entertainment is \"mediocre\" at best. OK....now the positives; This resort is small, but GORGEOUS!! The landscaping is amazing, and the layout is different - to say the least. We arrived late on a Monday night (around 9:00 pm) and were the only ones on the bus, so check in was quick and easy. The porter took our luggage and led us through a wonderland of jungle paths to our room. The room was simple, but well appointed. The bathroom was all stone tile, with a walk in shower. In the main room was a flat screen TV and a safe in the closet. We found out the next day that this was a Studio Suite upgrade, and managed to talk management into letting us stay in the room for the rest of the week. ($$) We spent the first night at Papo's bar on the second floor over the lobby, and the bartender Zamudio took care of our every need. As the week progressed we came to know and respect Zamudio as he became our friend. As our second day approached we learned more about the resort layout - including the two pools and the buffet restaurant. Service at the buffet is hit and miss.... depending on your server. Valentine will make sure you have everything you need, but others are not so conciensous.(?) Also, don't wait for cutlery, or napkins, or even coffee, as you may have to get it yourself. The food is good, but not always hot, or even warm. We found one of the \"a-la-carte\" restaurants by accident, and booked supper the second night there. It was \"extra\" (get used to it) but worth it. We had an excellent dinner with a personal concert by one of the ex-members of the \"Platters\" who was amazing. We also ate at the Italian a-la-carte a couple of times, which was good ( and no extra fee) however we never managed to make the Mexican restaurant. If the bufffet is not your style, there is a snack bar by the pools, which serves hot dogs, hamburgers, chicken wings, nacho's, and french fries which will all fill the gap. Make sure to see Felix at the swim up bar, and have a Mango Tango, or a Summer Spirit. We were never pressured to attend the \"meetings\" (not time share?) but they did ask. The beach was awesome, but don't bring your snorkelling gear unless you take an excursion. As a regular Sunwing customer, this is one of my pet peeves. At the welcome meeting, they tell you that you can do the snorkelling for 1/2 day (nothing included) for $80 per person, however you can arrange it through the hotel dive shop for $33 per person. Sunwing also said that horseback riding on the beach is $80/person per hour!!! I don't think so! Playa del Carmen is a 15 minute walk from the resort, easier on the street than the beach. Or you can take a taxi for $5 (US) one way. Be prepared to be accosted in Playa - the vendors have no problem hounding you relentlessly. Also, be aware of their pricing - one store wanted to charge us $70 for a Mexican flag worth maybe $2!!! The staff here are awesome - for this reason alone I would return.

We wanted a smaller (and less expensive) all-inclusive resort and chose the Reef from a short list. The hotel, sitting next to the massive and ornate Riu Palace looks unimposing. The lobby and bar area were well-kept and small. Check-in was quick and other than a brief attempt to introduce us to time-shares, we headed to our room. Leaving ther lobby, we were on a walkway of native multi-colored woods under a canopy of trees. The rooms are in small buildings, about twenty or so, with twelve rooms to a building. The walkway wove through the trees and plants cool and quiet. Our room, on the second floor, was clean and equipped with a small refrigerator. I had asked for a king-bed but got two full-sized, both of which had very firm matresses. The bath had a tub/shower (high step into the tub)and plenty of towels and soap. A small balcony with two chairs and a table overlooked the grounds. Pathways led to the beach area where the two small pools and the restaurants are. The lot is narrowish and the buildings close, but the feeling is one of more spaciousness as the buildingsg are smaller and not looming over you. We arrived between lunch and supper, so ate at the poolside snackbar and got drinks from the poolside bar next to it. The beach is wide and clean. Wave action is cutting into it, so at the high-water mark there is a drop of about a foot down to the packed sand. Pleny of chairs and umbrellas are provided, as they are at pool-side. Plenty of space to get sun or shade. Meals are good. The selection was plentiful and varied including lots of fresh fruit and salads. Several entrees were served each night and after a few days you'd inevitably recognize some of them. The quality was very high and the service, particularly Carlos, was excellent. Alcoholic drinks were on the weak side, but were free and only a short walk away. We tried Botticelli's Italian restaurant (Upstairs from the main restaurant Chula Vista, no reservation required, dress code that was not being observed) and found the meal great, but the service less than we expected (had to ask twice for napkins, water, and never got our drink order). The shows were fun, energetic, entertaining. Lots of activities for everyone. Town, Playa del CArmen, is about a fifteen minute walk on the beach or on safe, easy sindwalks. Fifth Avenue is the hot spot, about a mile long for the tourist area with some side streets. You can find anything you want (within legal limits I imagine) and the prices match it. For better values go the short distance to Tenth Ave. or beyond. Bring an insulated mug with a closed top for drinks. Bring U.S. one dollar bills for tips.

Also, DO NOT LEAVE OUT personal items that you do not want stollen in your room... if your money goes missing, then it's your problem, not theirs as you should have used the safe in your room (which you're charged $2 per day of use). When the hotel staff checks their \"lost and found\" ... a word to the wise, they dont have one, because it's called their own pocket.... as we found out this morning. The guy behind the desk was wearing our money clip on his shirt pocket after a little girl found it and turned it in where we'd lost it, the guy didn't even bother alerting us that it had been found. We reported it missing a day earlier. If we hadn't continued to hassle the front desk, we wouldn't have got it back (though our wad of money is lost, at least we have our $ clip back)... ALSO, if the entertainment staff says lets go salsa dancing, but charges you $35 each to go to Senior Frogs, it's a SCAM!!! Senior Frogs does not charge you to get in, and it was not even salsa dancing... it was a regular crowded club where the entertainment staff disappeared immediately once we got there. So, just throw away $70 US on maybe 3 drinks... wow, what a scam.Yes, they only disappeared until they wanted a drink and had you flash your braclet to the bartender so they could get a free drink... that's about it. You can go on your own, dont be fooled into thinking they can show you the town, what a scam. You can walk to Senior frogs in only like 15 minutes for free!! You can walk on your own to anywhere downtown, dont have to blow your $$. The beach is great, and that is why we came. Rooms are okay, not horrible, we had to fix our toilet almost daily. Food is decent, the Italian restaurant was the best, the service was great in both the italian & mexican restuarant.

I chose the Reef because it was the least expensive of the resorts in the Playacar area and I wanted to be close to Playa Del Carmen and its shops, bars and restaurants. The Reef isn\u2019t perfect by any means, but was well worth the price in comparison to higher priced resorts. This was my 4th time to the Cancun-Riviera Maya area and each time was with a different resort. I would call this a \u201cBlue Collar\u201d resort and it suited me just fine. I booked my package through Expedia, flew with Delta and used Cancun-Express for airport transfers and would use them all again. Everyone was very professional. I didn\u2019t hear of anyone getting ill and I even drank the water from the tap, although I didn\u2019t like it very well because it was heavily chlorinated. They have bottled water available anyway. We tried most of the food in the buffet and ate at both restaurants as well. I\u2019m not a picky eater, so I thought the food was great. You sometimes have to wait in lines as they don\u2019t take reservations. Just be patient and you will be fed. The grounds were very well maintained, cleaned continuously and landscaped very beautifully. The staff was very friendly, hard working and helpful. I was never asked to buy a time share on the Reef property. The beach goes on forever and is absolutely gorgeous. Playa Del Carmen is a leisurely 20 minute walk down the beach. You can get to town on the sidewalk in front of the resort, but we never did that, although plenty of other people do so and it is very safe. We didn\u2019t try the bicycles. The taxi cabs are $5 each way, which is how we preferred to get to town. There is another small shopping area in Playacar that is only a short walk to the south of the Reef that has nearly everything that Playa Del Carmen has, but no bars or restaurants and fewer pushy salesmen which is an asset. If you take your laptop, there is free wi-fi in the lobby that isn\u2018t mentioned on the website. I took full advantage of that to keep informed of weather, headlines and to keep in touch with my family. The coffee bar and ice cream bar are open for a short time each day and are well worth a visit if you like ice cream and coffee. At the coffee bar you can get Irish, Mayan, Mexican and Spanish coffees with different liquors in them. They heat it up over a fire which causes most of the alcohol to burn off. It is fun to watch. We had a few issues, some that are mentioned by other reviewers, but we chose not to whine about it; the positive far outweigh the negative. Most of the folks staying at the Reef were friendly and we met people from all over the globe. A few drinks at the bar seem to help people relax and open up.

The food at the buffet was very good compared to most all inclusive buffets. Lots of choices for breakfast and great omlettes cooked as you like them while you watch. Lunches were good and you had a choice of a snack bar near the pool or the buffet. The lunch buffet was generally very good and quite tasty with a reasonable selection that varied from day to day. The snack bar had hamburgers, hot dogs, fries and nachos but if you needed more variety, hit the buffet. We did not eat dinner at the buffet since we prefer to go to the specialty restaurants for a sit down dinner in the evening. There are two specialty restaurants, Mexican and Italian. Both had good food, but not what I would call five star. The menu is a bit limited but since you alternate nights that they are open, you can find something good to eat for a week or so. If you are planning a two week vacation, it would get a bit repetitive. Service was generally good. Remember you are in Mexico and the waiter's language skills are limited, but they try hard and will do anything to please if you ask. The beach was just rebuilt after hurricane damage last year. We watched them turn a sliver of beach into a beautiful sandy playgound in two days as we looked on in awe. It was quite a construction project which I am sure is now complete. We were able to use the beach for the last 5 days of our trip although part of it was roped off for construction vehicles. By now, it should be completed. The water of course is a beautiful color and the ocean bottom was mostly sandy. Since its reconstruction, it is as good a beach as anywhere in the Carribbean. Some days the red flags flew because of wind and waves, but you could still get in and play. The rooms were clean and had very firm beds which we like. They are not fancy, but are nice and roomy with a table and two chairs and a vanity. Bathrooms have a tub and shower. Every room has its own balcony which we enjoyed after a day in the sun. The grounds are immaculately cared for and each unit holding twelve rooms is connected by beautifully designed stone pathways through a garden (jungle) setting. Most of the rooms do not face the ocean but overlook the garden setting. Workers are constantly trimming and cleaning up leaves on the walks and throughout the garden. If you want a peaceful relaxing setting that is beautiful, look no further. Since the resort has 204 rooms, it is smaller than most and has a more intimate, relaxing feel. Although The Reef is not noted as an adult only facility there were not a lot of children present. There is a children's pool but no water slides for the kids so if that is your thing, probably you should choose another resort. Couples can relax here because the few children we saw, were very well behaved. It was February and not spring break so maybe things could be different during a holiday season. Other reviews indicated a problem with mosquitoes, but we saw two. Probably depends on the weather and season. Our weather was slightly overcast but was warm and in a week we had only one shower that lasted about a half an hour. All in all a very relaxing vacation with a beatuful beach, pool area and grounds. The resort is located within the community of Playacar about 15 minutes walk to Playa Del Carmen. It was away from the hustle bustle of Cancuun, no traffic and not a single person on the beach trying to sell souveniers.

There is a small Plaza about 5 mins from the resort which has a bank machine, money exchange booth, a drug store and a varitey of small stores.

We have two children who were kept busy with the variety of daily activities coordinated by the amazing friendly entertainment staff, from water volleyball, to ping pong, beach volleyball, etc. This is a smaller resort, which comes in handy for accessing the buffet, your room, the lobby, snack shack, and awesome ice cream parlor throughout the day. The buffet had a good variety of food choices and we often returned in the evening to the buffet rather than the a la cartes for that reason.

A FABULOUS resort if your seeking smaller, friendly, economical vaction. We have returned there so many times because we enjoy the smaller resort atmosphere. We met and socialized with others from Canada, Germany, France, Holland, etc. this is a direct result of the smaller resort. We have visited other LARGER resorts in Playacar but due to the size of the resort and larger numbers of guests, never experianced the friendships we have at the Reef. Again let me say that the Reef is a smaller resort (203 rooms) It takes less than 5 min to get from the lobby to the beach. The venture is beautiful. The center court pathway landscaping is full of trees, plants and local small animals (eg. sereque, lemur & geckos). This pathway allows many \"holas\" to be exchanged between guests & staff. The Reef is ALWAYS immaculate. There are always staff cleaning & sweeping the common areas of the resort. The food/bar service is excellent. The Reef has started a no reservation policy for the 2 specialty restaurants. You show up at the time you wish to dine. If they are full, you are given a pager to let you know when your table is ready. The rooms are clean and neat. Yes they are a little dated but everytime we had a need the maintenance staff, they were there within minutes to fix or replace broken items. The beds are harder than most of us are used to but the Reef does offer a varity of pillows in each room to accomidate different pillow wishes. The acitivity staff are a group of hard working indiviuals, who work hard to ensure everyone has a good time. They are especially good when working with the children from the various countries. The BEACH is the best in the area. There are always chairs available during the day. There are 2 pools, which are kept clean daily. The chairs seem to be in shorter supply by the pool areas. Let me finish with this advice. If you are seeking a 5 star resort, full of premium food /liquor, marble hallways, anticeptic surroundings and staff...this is NOT for you. What you will get at the Reef( a 3+ star) is good quality food/liquor, gorgeous atmosphere and friendly staff. The difference between the 5 star and 3+ star for us was about $1000 when we scheduled our visit. Enjoy the REEF..... we are sure you will!!!!

The food is good, but don't expect authentic Mexican, which I didn't. I ate at the buffet for most meals and ate at the Mexican restaurant once. The snack bar was good, but the cleanliness could be improved. At the snack bar and outdoor bars it appeared that they pretty much only rinsed rather than washed the plastic glasses which are re used. This hotel has a lot of Europeans and Mexicans staying there which I found nice. It is kind of a relief sometimes to not have to stay in places in Mexico with a lot of whiney and paranoid (with emphasis) Americans (particularly Texans, where I am from by the way) expecting to be catered to or expecting it to be like back home. The beach is excellent, much better than anything you get on the so called Riviera Maya, which is mostly time shares with manufactured (man made) beaches. For my purposes which was spending pretty much half of every day on the beach and the rest just wandering around close by in Playa this place was incredible. I go to the carribean for the Ocean 1st and foremost and this place doesn't dissappoint. From many people I heard that the diving and snorkeling tours were fabulous, and I have done some of this in the area on past trips and found it to be excellent. The dive shop at the hotel has a great reputation in this area. Only thing I might warn about is that during the deep winter months you are dealing with a colder current at sea, so the ocean can be cooler than in the summer and the prevailing breezes are coming in off the ocean which can maybe make it feel a bit cooler if it is cloudy. Still great tropical sun when it is even partly clear. The cloudiness can be a bit of a relief sometimes as well.

At first we almost wondered if he was actually the concierge- he was very young and looked like he'd just walked out of a California fraternity. We spent the rest of the vacation avoiding him and making runs into town to pick up bottled drinks for other guests.

We went back to the front desk and compained about the state of our rooms. We were told that nothing would be done until the morning. In the morning, the manager didn't seem to be too concerned, even when we said that we were hoping to change hotels. He offered us a small discount on an upgraded room, or a room change, but couldn't tell us why our rooms were dirty to begin with and why we were booked into them if the hotel was less than half full. He didn't seem to apologetic or concerned. This resort seems to suffer from poor management problems.

Having read many of the reviews on Trip Advisor about people getting sick at this resort, we had some concerns but were willing to take our chances and are so very glad we did. The Reef is unlike any of the other resorts (and we've stayed at quite a few) and this was our second visit. Since our visit in 2005, the resort has added an ice cream parlor set on the edge of the cenote which gives snack time an added garden charm surrounded by the sounds of falling water and the lush greenery. They have also enhanced the \"patio\" area that is set in the center of the jungle in the middle of the resort by adding sofas, tables and chairs -- at 5 pm they serve designer coffee with your choice of liqueur and tiny dessert nibbles -- it's absolutely charming and quite decadent in a wonderfully indulgent way. The beach is as beautiful as ever. Our room was very clean and pleasant without any of the issues mentioned by previous guests about leaking air conditioners or whatever. Our patio (ground floor) was nestled in the jungle area and we enjoyed watching the Agoutis (small animals) forage for their food. The food was nicely prepared with a reasonable amount of variety, considering that this is an all-inclusive buffet style eating arrangement. It is by no means gourmet, but if a traveler wants 5 star dining, I would suggest they pay the $400 per night at a more expensive resort to get it. The Reef's food is plentiful, varied, some of it is cooked to order, and there is something to suit everybody. We enjoyed the variety of international visitors and socialized with folks from France, Germany, Italy and the USA. The Reef has become very popular with Europeans and provides a much more cosmopolitan atmosphere than our previous visit. Because we have visited Playa Del Carmen quite a few times before and have been to Cozumel, Tulum, Coba, Chichen Itza and various other attractions, this visit we spent most of our time at the resort although we did spend a day/evening at Xcaret which was wonderful and we would highly recommend it.

We were traveling as a part of a larger group of 9 with the purpose of attending a wedding at the Reef for my brother-in-law. As far as sickness is concerned, no one in our group of 9 people got sick during our stay. My husband and I did not drink the water or have have ice in my drinks; however, the rest of our group did and were just fine. One thing I would suggest is taking 2 tablets of Pepto Bismol every day for 2 weeks before your trip and then before each meal while traveling. Our group did not enjoy the food. I don't know if we were just not used to their food or if it was just subpar. Breakfast was by far the best meal with omelets made to order, french toast, and pancakes. The snack bar served hot dogs and hamburgers which weren't too awful. One night a few of us ended up ordering Domino's pizza which was one of the best meals we had all week. There are fancy Italian and Mexican dinner nights; however, you are required to make reservations for these. Reservations must be made in the lobby between 9 and 11 am. I would suggest getting there right away as there is usually a long line. We only ate at the nicer restaurant twice, and both nights were Italian night. The food here is MUCH better than the normal dinner buffet. Also, a note to guys, long pants and close-toed shoes are required when eating at the Italian & Mexican restaurants. As far as our room was concerned, it was adequate. We did have a few problems with our room (t.v. did not work, faucet leaked, shower leaked). The rooms are not very soundproof and noises seem to be magnified. Our rooms did seem to be clean though. Our airconditioner worked just fine though it did leak water onto the floor (I think all of the rooms have this problem though). The beachfront was one of the nicer ones we saw along the coast. There are some sandbags as a few others have pointed out. While they are not very pleasant to look at, they do serve a pupose and we didn't find them overly distracting to the view. The water and beach were clean and there were always plenty of chairs. The pools were clean and not too crowded most of the time; however, we were kicked out of the pools a couple of times well before they were closed. The pools were not well lit at nght and there was not much for lighting around the pools or down on the beach which made it feel uninviting. No one really seems to use the pools as night. The swim-up bar was a nice feature to to the pool area as well as the canopy beds. The greenery and natural atmosphere at the resort were beautiful. One thing we were surprised by was the lack of Americans at this resort. It seemed as though the majority of the people staying at this resort were Mexican or French. Also, we were shocked by how few of the workers actually spoke decent English. It was very hard to converse at times with the language barrier. In general, the staff was very pleasant and friendly. The staff in the lobby actually helped us order our pizza the one night. We did meet the infamous Brandon that everyone writes about. What they say is true. He will hound you the entire time you are there. Be firm with him and just say \"No!\". There seemed to be more than enough activities available during our stay. There is volleyball, tennis, pool tables, ping-pong, and various water activities all for free. There is typically a show every night at the Reef. Both shows we ended started well after the scheduled time. I would highly recommend attending the Mexican fiesta night as it was quite impressive and entertaining. Our family also attended the 70's night which was horrible. We should have sat in the back and made a quick exit. The shops and restaurants down on 5th Avenue in Playa Del Carmen are within walking distance of the Reef. We walked into town one evening and it was easy to find our way around. The area seemed to be quite safe for travelers. Overall, I would say that the Reef is just so-so. It is one of the more affordable resorts along the beachfront, but if you go here, don't expect super fancy rooms and good food.

There are also cute little lizards out and about every so often, but they're too fast to catch! I know a lot of people are saying the food is bad, but I didn't think so at all. The snack bar was awesome, my favorite was the guacamole, I ate it all week. :o) The pool was beautiful, no complaints at all. This isn't a huge resort, so there was only one swim up bar. There are three bars total in the whole resort I believe. One on the rooftop, and two down below by the pool. The beach was a lot different the second time we went. I guess the year before the beach really changed because of Hurricane Katrina. The first trip in 2004 the beach was HUGE! We sat in chairs with umbrellas and were served drinks, but when we went in Jan 07 the beach was gone. The sea level was so high that there was no room anymore. There was a small spot that you could still swim in, but overall there was no more beach to walk on. Maybe it's different now, because that was 2.5 years ago, it's worth looking into. Even though it's smaller, we still had an awesome time and were able to enjoy the ocean. If anything there's more room now for water activites! As far as entertainment goes, we booked a catamaran in the lobby, BEST PART OF THE WHOLE VACATION! I highly recommend doing a catamaran if you are going to carribbean. It felt like we were in a dream, and all I did the whole boat ride was think of how lucky I was to be dipping my feet in crystal clear water, and probably wouldn't be doing it again for at least a year! The group I was with also rented the wave runners the third day we were there. It was a blast, there were nine of us cruising around the perfect water. It was just amazing. The rooms themselves are alright. Nothing TOO special, but they were very clean and I didn't really have any complaints other than the poor water pressure in the shower, but that is common with Mexican resorts. We didn't spend a lot of time in our room anyway, there was too much to do all around us! One of my favorite nights was a Friday night at Senor Frogs. It was one big party and was by far our craziest night in the Riviera Maya! We stayed out all night and just had a blast. They walk around in Senor Frogs with a whistle and a bottle of some fruity tequila drink. If they stop and blow the whistle at you, you have to put your head back and they poor it in your mouth.

Of the six items on the menu, two entrees were not available on two different nights. It got boring and that is why we went into town our last night there.

It is built within a preserved jungle, so walking through the resort you will see a natural cenote, iguanas, geckos, and cute squirrel/rabbit type animals that I can\u2019t remember the name of. The beach is the best in the area from what I saw; it is very deep with soft white sand and crystal clear water and plenty of chairs. There was never a problem finding chairs no matter what time of day we went out there. The rooms were nice and clean, and the air conditioner worked all 8 days and the shower had decent pressure, and the bed had an egg crate pad on it so it was the softest I have slept in while in Mexico. The specialty restaurants and the ice cream parlor were excellent; the ice cream parlor was my favorite because they had a ton of choices which were all good. The buffet was what I expected and on par with the other all inclusive resorts I stayed at, the breakfast was the best but lunch and dinner were good also, but not much changed over 8 days but that is what I expected. The staff was friendly and helpful, the entertainment staff was awesome and made sure everyone enjoyed themselves, and the bar and wait staff were great, especially Hoberto at the rooftop bar. We used Best Day Travel for transportation from the airport to hotel and back, and they were great, very funny drivers, I would definitely recommend using them. The major problem we had was my wife getting extremely sick. I didn\u2019t catch anything over the 8 days, but my wife caught something and was sick and stuck in the room about 3 days vomiting, and has just now started to feel better. All she could keep down was about 5 slices of watermelon over 3 days. It seems she, as well as a couple of other guests that we met during our stay, caught what had been going around and mentioned in previous postings. The resort seems to be on top of everything, they have hand sanitizer in all restrooms and all places that food and beverages are served but she still got sick, so who knows. I would make sure and pack some sort of antibiotic before leaving, because what she caught was bad. Another thing to watch for is Brandon, your \u201cpersonal concierge.\u201d He is nothing more than a timeshare salesman, and an annoying and rude one at that. We had not even had time to put our bags in the room after a long day of travel before he was trying to sell us club membership, but we said no right off the bat and he gave us a smug comment and whined a little bit about his \u201cpoints\u201d but he left us alone for the rest of the trip.

The sister hotel immediately upgraded us to the Royal across the road, which turned out to be an amazing experience. When we returned we were shown to an ordinary room which was a bit smelly and dark. However, the manager had promised an upgrade on our return for the inconvenience, and the following day (day 3) we were shown to one of the suites overlooking the pool and with a gorgeous view of the sea. It was much nicer, and given the chance again I would pay for the upgrade. Anyway, our experience at the Reef Playacar was a positive one. I really enjoyed the food that came with the all-inclusive package. The buffet is available for breakfast, lunch and dinner, but you can also have ice-cream in the afternoon from the parlour, and burgers and chips (for example) at lunchtime from the snackbar. For dinner there are two nice restaurants to choose from if the buffet doesn't suit: an Italian and a Mexican, though you have to get up relatively early to book them at reception on the day itself. The pool was lovely with a swim-up bar for free cocktails, and you don't have to be up ridiculously early to bagsy a lounger or a palapa. The drawback to staying at this hotel is that it is a 20 minute walk from the town centre, something I did not think I would mind, but it can be a nuisance if you want to go there a couple of times a day. There are similar hotels in town, which I would prefer to stay at in future. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to families. There are activities (like water polo) to get involved in during the day and shows at night for children. The setting is also lovely and jungly with the odd interesting bit of wildlife around. Here's some tips during your stay: 1. If you are staying here a while and thinking about visiting Xel Ha, consider setting aside 2 days if you can afford to. 2. If you want to visit any of the Mayan sites, like Tulum or Coba, do NOT use Odyssey Tours as they abandoned me at Tulum on my own without warning and without leaving me enough money to make my own way back. 3.

We were there for 1 week and had nothing bad to say about the hotel. We wanted to make sure that there was at least one good review of the hotel on here; it really does deserve it. First, the hotel is a great value for what you pay for it. The grounds are beautiful, we did not have a single bug in our room the entire week (which for the climate is pretty impressive), and the sandbags that everyone complains about do (as a few others pointed out) create a neat little reef to snorkel around at. The beach really is as beautiful as any other more expensive hotel in the area. Secondly, the food is not that bad. The buffet does have roughly the same things every day but didn't go there for food. For what you pay to stay at the Reef, if you are expecting gourmet, five-star, Ritz-Carlton type food than you are delusional. :o) We ate at the buffet daily for breakfast and lunch, at the snack bar pretty regularly, and the Italian restaurant once and did not get sick in the slightest. We also drank the water every day as well. So, yes, the food is not spectacular but it works. If you want better food, go into town. Pretty simple. The drinks, however, were a little disappointing. The margaritas and beer are all served in plastic cups unless you get a drink in the lobby bar (which was actually the best bar but it wasn't open very much). As far as bottled water, though, they do put two bottles in your room and the replenish them daily if you use them. They are ten pesos per bottle which is 80 cents USD. Otherwise, the tap water is purified and we drank it, saving the bottled water for taking with when we left the hotel. There is also an amazingly lot to do at the hotel and in the area. We did the snorkeling and the Discovery scuba course through the hotel. Both were worth the money we paid. Xavier was very friendly each time we saw him. By and large the staff was very friendly as well. There were a few staff that really exceeded our expectations after reading all the bad reviews. Antonio, Pancho, Franco, and the two girls on the entertainment staff (their names escape me) were great and really made the stay a lot more fun. The one thing I couldn't give the hotel a 5 for was the rooms though. They were clean and cozy but the beds were really hard and the pillows were not the greatest (although I guess you can order different pillows but I didn't notice that until we were getting ready to check out).

Just tell them \"no\" right off the bat, and hopefully they leave you alone. Everything was absolutely perfect. The landscaping was gorgeous; native trees, plants, animals, all within the confines of the resorts courtyards. It really gives the resort a great ambiance. The sandbags on the beach, which I saw a few reviews complaining about, serve a purpose. They were placed there after Hurricane Wilma tore up the beaches in 2005. They prevent the beaches from eroding away, and they also seem to serve as an artificial reef, attracting fish, eels, rays, etc, all of which make snorkeling much more fun. I also saw many people complain about the food in their reviews. I thought the food was great! The fish was absolutely perfect. There was fresh fruit served at every meal, as well as a variety of fresh vegetables. It's not Ryan's Steakhouse or Old Country Buffet.....the Reef serves a few different choices of quality food at each meal. If these people wanted \"more variety\", they should have stayed in the states and frequented Applebees or Bonanza, instead. The food is good, and there's enough variety for a normal people. The staff was extermely friendly, outgoing and a pleasure to be around. Regarding people getting sick, I can empathize with them, though I was fortunate enough to stay healthy. Personaly, I thought the Reef was taking every necessary precaution to avoid cross-contamination and the spreading of germs. Hand sanitizer was a requirement to even step foot in the restaurants, the food was served extremely hot, and the water that comes out of the tap is supposedly purified. I drank water, iced tea, and lemonade every single day, I ate their food, and I never became ill.

Even though we all stopped projectile vomiting within 12 hours, we were too nervous to go very far away from the resort because of the diarrhea. My husband and I spent about $80/day on gatorade & bottled water from the sundries store because we wouldn't touch anything the reef had to offer and they sure didn't offer us bottled water. Did Management care? They wouldn't even acknowledge there was a problem at their resort. They even had the nerve to blame it on us drinking too much. I had 3 drinks the day we got there and was fine the next day. It was 1 hour after dinner that most of us got sick - after eating their food. Management did sent a Dr to my friend's room the 2nd time she came down with the sickness. He and his 'translator' did the normal tests and wanted a stool sample and then prescribed cipro and 2 other things. I understood enough of spanish to hear them say 'she has what they all have, just give her antibiotics, she is leaving tomorrow anyway'. The sad thing is that this could be a fabulous resort if management would actually care about the guests. Being americans we always got served last at the 1 bar open during the day and in the buffet lines. We paid more to stay there than the locals did, why did they get preferential treatment? The last day we were there they had the buffet restuarant closed for 'maintenance'. Hopefully that means they finally found the source of the sickness and were fixing it but we have no clue since they wouldn't even admit to us there was a problem.

We stayed at Reef Playacar for the first 4 nights. On the second night I woke up very ill at 2am and was sick for about 12 hr. in bed and in the bathroom. Then, I was still nauseated for another couple of days. We had to cancel our snorkel trip to Xel Ha and the trip to Tulum on Wed. It was awful. I am pretty sure if was from eating soup at the mexican rest. It was really the only thing that I ate and my husband didn't. The front desk did send up some toast and sprite for me. But, other than that, they didn't seem to care. I asked if they thought it was H1N1 virus, she said NO. But, really, how would a front desk gal know. Also, on Thur. our water was shut off and my husband went to the front desk to inquire about changing rooms, because from the beginning our bathroom flooded everytime we took a shower. We had to sop up the water w/ all our towels after we were done. We were just going to deal with it, but after the sickness and NO WATER, we had HAD it. I was READY to go HOME. He asked if we can get a disct for the NO WATER?? they said, NO. NOT EVEN FREE Bottled water. geeze. So, he asked to change rooms (which we wanted to do anyway)..they said not until later in the afternoon (it was early morning). Also, when we first turned our shower on, brown/orange water came out for about 1 min. (now that I am thinking, I wonder if that is what made me sick?! who knows) So, eventually, we upgraded to the Riu Palace next door with the help of Juan Pablo from Lomas Travel! he was soooooo amazing and helpful. He also had been helping us book our excursions thru out the week. I highly recommend his service. So, the last 3 nights we were in the Riu. I wish we had done that in the first place, it was worth the extra money! =) I felt bad for C&N wedding party!

The landscaping is indeed beautiful, I can't imagine the upkeep but they do a nice job keeping it so beautiful. Our rooms were nice - water pressure - good, air worked good. Our TV died at 10:30 one evening, and the maintenance crew brought us a new one right away. We met some very nice folks there, the Love's from Indiana, Randi, Barry and friends from Denver, and the group from Medina. Everyone at one time or another seemed to be sick during their stay - some worse then others. The food was more than just bad - barely edible at times. By days 4 or 5, I would have killed for a Bob Evans or Cracker Barrel - just something to eat! Of course, I didn't starve but avoided the buffett completely the last few days of our 11 day stay. We ate at 5th Ave a few times, but I realize now...I don't really care for authentic Mexican food. I will just eat my US Tex Mex, thank you. ** Note to management at the Reef - A smile goes a long way. If you staff would just smile now and then - I think guests would feel more welcome. Antonio (pool area) and Paulino (buffet waiter) are rays of sunshine on the Reef staff - they are both such happy guys you can't help but enjoy their company. The rest of your staff could learn from them. The first weekend we were there, all of a sudden the resort was packed with people - because they opened up for locals to come on in! For $100.00 they got 2 nights, late check out, all the amenities of the resort including a massage, manicure and pedicure. How many of you got such a deal in your packages? I really didn't mind other than the fact that service went from bad to worse. Americans were not waited on until you were the only ones left standing....if you were in line with locals - you were completely ignored. The beach - BEAUTIFUL, pools were nice. If you can - be sure and take a jet ski out on that beautiful crystal clear water. Make sure you go out on a sunny day - it makes all the difference on the water. We took a taxi to Akumal and spent an entire day there - the cab driver took us straight to the beach. $30.00 each way. We snorkeled with the turtles and it was the highlight of our trip, we are so glad we went. If you like to snorkel, Go to Akumal!! My only regret is that we didn't go back a second time before we left. We did have a good time in Mexico (hard not to have a blast - it's vacation!), but I would not go back to The Reef. I agree with other travelers - spend a little more $$ and enjoy the whole resort - not just parts of it. If you do eat at the resort - be careful, and take plenty of Imodium Advanced - you will need it.

We were hoping for a relaxing vacation and to check out the resort for our destination wedding next year. We were hugely disappointing after the bad service and the fact that we spent 1 night in the hospital and 1 night in our rooms sick. The resort is beautiful, the weather was great, and we had a blast sun bathing and playing in the ocean for 1 day. By 2pm on the 2nd day of our vacation I was uncontrollably vomiting and had a serious case of what I can only describe as butt soup. At 5pm my mother followed with the same symptoms, her condition was worse then myself as she had a surgery a few years ago that does not allow her to throw up. Should she, her stomach would rupture and could be fatal. She was hospitalized and I too as I was very dehydrated. After being rushed to the Cancun Hospitan by ambulance and spending $4000 in medical expenses, my fiance and uncle returned to their rooms to spend the night switching from face to butt on the toilet. They did not go to the hospital because we did not have any more money to put down as a down payment. (In Mexico, insurances are usually accepted, but they do not even call the insurance providers. In stead they make you put down a deposit of -in our case $4000/each- before they would help us. My mother was lucky to have 1. the best credit a person could have 2. worked at a bank for 17 years and asked a friend to go into the bank at midnight and up her credit limit to $15,000. I suggest that anyone going out of the country contact their insurance company and make them aware that you are leaving the country and bring a credit card with a $6000/person limit for emergencies.) To this date, the resort is denying any fault of their own in this situation. They are asking for paper work from the doctors to say that the illness is the result of the resort. During the time that I spent at the resort a wedding party of 50+ people had all gotten sick, all the other couples we met too were sick and the wedding on the Monday that I left, the bride got back from the hospital 1 hour before her ceremony. If this isn't the result of the hotel, I don't know what is. The resort told me that we had brought this illness into the resort, but while we were there, we were only at the resort before we got sick and the 1st wedding party got sick before we ever showed up.

I have done my research and am well aware that you know that there is a gastrointestinal virus that has been infecting a great majority of your guests.I was told by your staff that doctors and scientists have been trying to identify what is causing the illness. I was visiting for a friends wedding with a group of 44 people, all of whom were violently ill for most of the stay. Some of these people were elderly and young children with immune systems that can not support such an illness. Myself and my girlfriend were up all night vomiting profusely with horrific diarrhea and still do not feel normal two days after departing Mexico and returning to the USA. I am a professional chef and a restaurant owner in California, and I am highly educated in food safety, sanitation and preparation. The food served in the main dining hall, the snack bar and at the wedding was the worst quality I have ever seen in any establishment in the world. Serving the same re-heated meat for breakfast that was sitting out the night before at the end of dinner is a major health violation. Rancid cheese on the cold buffet line is unacceptable as well. The air conditioner in our room was barely functioning and dripping water all over the floor. I discovered this as I slipped on my way to the restroom to vomit from the illness that your staff is ignoring. Also, an expensive cell phone was left in our room and is nowhere to be found.

This was very unsettling news after hearing about the swine flu on all the news channels. Then sure enough on the 2nd day my sister and niece were rushed to the hospital with explosive diareah and projectile vomiting. The hospital in Playa del Carmen was great but they do not accept American health insurance in Mexico and wont see you until your credit card authorizes $2,000.00 up front for each person being treated. We had heard from the other sick guests that the hotel was gracious enough to cover all medical expenses but when we asked they said no because we were not with the large wedding party group.

The beds were a little hard, but the rooms were fairly spacious and the bathrooms were nice. The beach is perfect, the water was warm, and there were plenty of chairs and umbrellas for lounging. Come to think of it, we had a lot of space to ourselves, which may have been because so many travelers canceled their vacations due to the swine fu-which we were also worried about. We saw no signs of swine flu, but there was a 1-2 day bug going around where we each had some stomach issues and even a fever for a night.

The number of staff was noticeably less then at other resorts we have been at but I like getting up and getting my own drink when I am lounging by the pool or on the beach. We walked several times into Playa Del Carmen and that was just great and a couple times we took a taxi back for 50 pesos when the kids were tired. There were people from every nation here - all kinds of languages. The kids that went to the kids club seemed to develop a real attachment to the entertainment staff - my kids just wanted to hang with each other this time around. The size, location, and beauty of the resort and price point was the best we've gone to in the area and this is our 4th visit to this area in Mexico. There were a couple \"stars\" in the staff particularly Antonio who was always smiling and friendly and his job seems just to pick up the dirty dishes around the pool area... not a concierge or bartender or even a waiter.. we noticed that others around the pool area had befriended him and he got people smiling and laughing.... The one point that put a bit of a damper on the stay there was the food. Let me preface this by saying that our family is not a bunch of \"foodies\" - we eat because we need to live and as long as we have a healthy edible choice we eat all kinds of cooking. We went into this trip knowing about the so-so food comments and the claims of food poisoning... the price was so good to stay here and we weren't going to mexico for the food...so this would help keep our diets on track. To sum up, breakfast and lunch were ok. with acceptable options and quality. The snack bar food was below so-so and not worth the calories (except for the french fries). Dinner was way below so-so to the point where I stopped eating it and had a little lettuce, tomato, and cumcumbers with dressing... Even the fish was \"gummy\"/\"chewy\" not light and flaky. Everything was way over cooked which might be a reaction to the food poisoning reports. In the end this all helped my waistline as well as my husbands... but my point is to let you know that even the pasta wasn't good because something was up with the sauce - my daughter we LOVES pasta wouldn't eat it. There were virtually no vegetables and so many meat dishes which if you are having meat every meal with no veggies you will soon find that you don't feel so great and get sick. So what I am praying for is that the resort rethinks its menu options and changes the chef or something because if this resort improves its food, increases selection, and stays at the same price point..we'd actually go and stay there again... but not until I see more positive reviews on the food. NOTE: we ate in Playa Del Carmen at a couple of restaurants and they were pricey and not so great either so my opinion is that you have to have a decent food spread at your resort or rent a house and cook for yourself. Please note that we stayed for 10 nights and it was about the 5th night that we really started to not enjoy eating dinner at the buffet - we didn't try the speciality restaurants because we didn't feel like using our time to make reservations and so if you are going to this resort for less time you probably will be just fine with the food. Also, this resort had tons of precautions in place to avoid illness like hand santizer before walking into any eating or food area and by the bars, etc as well as they did all the serving in the buffet. We did catch the stomach bug that was going around at the very end but it was after we ate in Playa Del Carmen that we got sick for a few hours so I don't think there was food poisoning involved...just a stomach bug that can happen anywhere.", "Date": "May 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lee's Summit, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cSecond Time There\u201d", "Author": "MrHirp", "ReviewID": "UR29460125", "Content": "My wife and I visited the Reef Playacar from April 29- May 4th, it was our second stay.

Antonio is amazing to watch in action. He works his butt off, never stops smiling and engaging guests. Friday night, however, my wife became ill. She had to be admitted to the hospital aroundt he corner (the doctors are great there, really nice guys, nurses as well) It was turned out to be food poisoning. She was there 12 hours, and when we got back to the hotel, I became sick. I had some of her chicken, which we believe is what caused us both to get sick as well as the delay between. The hotel was great about helping. They arranged for transportation to the hospital, and are covering our costs. They also let us stay an extra night free, since we had to reschedule our flight back . Sales manager, Marja Hoogendijk, was a joy to deal with. She called and checked on us, and her concern was always sincere. Truth be told, they didn't have to do as much as they did. They easily could have claimed it was just a bug or something we brought with us, or picked up from another guest.

Actually, there is lots of dancing at the Reef Playacar! Especially with Franco and Pancho who are dancing queens to say the least. There are fun shows every night, Pancho dressed up as an indian for 70's night and that I don't really understand. Another fun employee is Antonio who cleans up around the pools. He is just a big bundle of joy. \"Its good to be alive, because when you're alive you can dream. How are you going to dream when you're dead?\" just a bit of Antonio's words of wisdom, he also makes great faces. They play great music from their little rock speakers along the paths, I was happily suprised to hear Crystal Castles coming from them. The jungle atmosphere was really nice, sometimes I really thought I had gotten lost in the middle of the rainforest and was going to get eaten by a jaguar. But then I came across the ice cream shed and was like \"Oh yeah, I'm at the Reef Playacar and they serve free ice cream\" and I'd get some. They have these cute little rat/rabbit things I don't really know how to explain them. They just hop around happily eating nuts. The beach is gorgeous but it has these rocks that I thought would be fun to walk on but I just slipped and fell in :( But the body surfing is great and the sand is nice and soft just like sand should be. I was not allowed to swim in the pool at night though and it was embarassing being kicked out since I was in a dress (it was a spontaneous swimming idea), and you aren't allowed on the beach at night either which is disappointing but you could be up watching Pancho and Franco and the other staff members performing for you on stage up at the bar. The rooms were just fine, I loved the balcony and saying goodnight to people as they headed back to their rooms for the night.

This was my first time in Mexico and I stayed at the Reef with my boyfriend. The experience doesn't make me feel like I want to come back to Mexico again. The jungle ambiance is kind of nice and fun, but the roaming tailess rodent family which lives on the grounds and is as big as a large rabbit is disgusting and I think indigenous to this resort. No one knows what it is nor have I seen it anywhere else. The staff must be breeding this animal in one of the vacant huts and must think its cute to have it roaming freely freakin out the guests, but its not cute. The service is inconsisent without explanation. Procedures for reservations and other services changed daily. This was very annoying and unsettling, I never felt the staff knew what was going on or even had the courtesy to explain things. The restaurants opened late on several occassions during our stay - so it just didn't feel reliable. I didn't like that the food had to be served and there was only one person behind the counter in the restaurants attending to the hundreds of people there. That meant longer than necessary waits for food or even to obtain a plate,it had to be given to you. This was unlike any other resort I've been in that normally have self serving buffets. The serving staff that didnt understand english would not say they don't understand. They would take your order, shake their head and your order would not come. The food was the same every single day, with maybe one new item but the service frustrated me to just eat a minimum and get out. The food staff just never seemed prepared when they were supposed to be, so a small crowd would develop waiting to be served. The beach was nice, the sand barges were a bit of an eye sore but it's ok. I didn't like having to be pitched to all the time by the staff for excursions, services, activities etc - the sales pressure turned me off and made me feel like I didnt want to be friendly with the staff to not trigger a slaes pitch. I also lost my phone and it was not returned, so this didn't leave a great impression of the guests or staff. People will be people however so it's all good. Best Day travel that handled our transport and excursions was wonderful. I do wish the resort would have made an attempt to inform us about the Swine Flu outbreak and the precautions they were taking but it was not mentioned anywhere. All food entrances did however make sure everyone disinfected their hands with hand sanitizers. It wasnt until our second to last day there that we heard ofthe flu. We saw some folks around town with masks on. One last thing, if you are looking for a romantic vacation with your partner, maybe go someplace that is adult only. There are lots of kids here and we were stuck with neighbors whose kid cried like clockwork every single day. The walls were paper thin. I tried using theroom phone after losing my cell and it was frustrating because I had to give my credit card info, the operator kept coming on the line after I already put in my info and they'd ask for it again and my calls rarely went thru. Im sure I was charged. No room service, rooms are dimly lit and the water smelled like sanitation. We got the stomach churn and bathroom runs after 4 days.

Needless to say, I would give them consideration. The location was great, short walk or $5 cab to shopping downtown. Plenty of chairs at beach and pool.

Some guests started getting bottled water in their rooms and some guests didn't. They gave us some then took them back. The bed was hard the pillows were harder. The staff soon started to disappear. They would have one person working in the snack bar after the third day we were there. The buffet had less and less food and not much change in the menu. The tables weren't cleaned after people ate.

Like many, I was worried after many rough reviews of the place. My wife and I took our first \"big\" trip with our 3 year old son and were very pleased. See the very end of this review for our \"travel history.\" We were greeted at the Airport by Best Day travel. After making our way through the gauntlet of porters wanting to help, we found our rep. Waited about 15 minutes to get in the shuttle to take us to Playa del Carmen. About 1 hour ride, after dropping other passengers off. Arrived at hotel, greeted with a beer and margarita, sprite for our son. Checked in, spoke with Arica (our \"personal concierge for the week,\" who we never saw again) and checked into our room. The room: Our room had two double beds, a balcony, large bathroom, plenty of closet and drawer space as well. The air conditioner worked very well and quickly, often too cold for my wife and son. The room was very clean and maintained well with everything we needed. We were one towel short the first day and within 10 minutes of calling, we had it. There is a small fridge, which was very nice to keep things cold. You can pay $50 for the week to keep it stocked. The Resort: We liked the size of the resort. We often saw the same people from day to day, especially hanging around the kiddie pool. Other folks we met from Oregon, Ireland, Canada were all very down to earth and friendly. There was no air of pretentiousness as we had experienced at the much more expensive Iberostars. If anything, I would say the clientele are mostly American, working class folks who enjoyed time away. There are some really neat jungle-like areas that we didn't spend a ton of time around. There are two real pool areas - the kid's pool connects to a more adult-oriented pool (with a swim up bar), the other has a lot of activity. The beach front is very nice. It was the only resort on that particular stretch that had umbrellas on the beach - many had them far back from the beach. The sandbags appeared to be down the coastline - we thought they'd be annoying, but you get used to them. It's amazing how much they help with the waves. We found the resort to be clean - and the things that were untidy were the fault of poor guest stewardship - that would be cleaned up by the next morning. If you see cigarette butts, garbage, etc, on the beach, it's not the fault of the staff. The service: We found the service to be good. Try a little, basic spanish and you'll always get a smile and what you're looking for. Drinks were actually a little strong for our taste, but there was always plenty. We waited a few times for drinks to be filled at meal times - which doesn't happen at other resorts. The food: It was adequate. We didn't go hungry and enjoyed most of what we ate, but there is not a ton of variety. If that is your primary reason for traveling, don't go here. You'll be disappointed. There was enough to satisfy a 3 year old (without having chicken nuggets on the menu!!), and we were ok with that was there. We did not eat at either of the two reservation restaurants. They do require slacks for men and closed toe shoes from what I read/heard. Etc: While we were there, many guests came down with a 12 hour bug. My wife and son included. It was unfortunate, but we heard many guests at many resorts caught it. I really don't think it was the food, the water, but poor hygiene of some guests that passed it on. After the sickness, food was served to us instead of \"help yourself\" at the buffet. We were also given free bottles of water for the duration. Overall: This hotel/resort is great for the budget-conscious traveler. The location, just a short cab ride or 15 minute walk to Playa del Carmen is very nice. The beach was as nice as any other, if not cleaner (less seaweed, etc) than most. We would definitely consider going back here again if we visited that area again. Best-Day tours / Expedia Booking through Expedia was a breeze. I have booked through many companies and found this to be as clear as any other. Best Day Tours worked well for us - and I never felt pressured to do any excursions, etc., with them. They present the info. We did have one hitch with them - our return shuttle left without us!!! After calling from the lobby phone, we were told to take a cab and deal with Expedia when we got home. Apparently, our shuttle driver was there at 10:10 and left at 10:20, knowing the bell captain was going to get our bags! I called Expedia this morning and have a $100 voucher from them, again, satisfying my experience with them. If you're working with Best Day, make sure that they are clear and you are ready early, I guess! It all worked out for us just fine.

This is my 10th all inclusive hotel. I\u2019ve stayed in resorts ranked from 3 to 5 stars, in locations such as Jamaica, Dominican Republic, Cuba and Mexico. We found this hotel very charming in it\u2019s jungle like setting. This hotel is located in a gated community where condos and seasonal villas are found. So essentially you are in a gated hotel within a gated community. Very safe. We avoid larger resorts as we find them more impersonal. We liked the close proximity to Playa del Carmen (10-15 min walk). The Reef was a perfect size, very easy to meet people, the staff was super friendly. A simple greeting and a tip goes along way to getting great and friendly service. Funny thing happens when you\u2019re friendly with people, they are usually friendly back! We tip at home and get less service, why wouldn\u2019t you do it here?? Property, Beach and Pool: We loved the layout of the resort. Both pools were always clean. Workers are always around cleaning the property and fixing stuff. It\u2019s some of the guests that are inconsiderate & dirty.. we found dirty diapers by the poolside.. come on! Are people that lazy they can\u2019t find a garbage can? Most mornings we walked to Playa or went off the property. After our return we never had a problem rounding up 6 loungers by either poolside or the beach. The bars were very nearby with no waiting time for drinks. We did have one of the nicest beaches; I didn\u2019t find it full of litter. You won\u2019t need water socks here as it\u2019s white sand, no rocks to hurt your feet. Some of the hotels along the way had no beach at all. Restaurants & Bars: Jesus at the beach bar, Victor, Felix & Alejandro at the swim up bar, and Pablo in the lobby bar were the best! We ate at the Italian restaurant once and it was good. Angelica at the buffet restaurant really took care of us. Our table of 6 and our 5 cervezas and 1 cola were always ready when she saw us coming for lunch. Hats off to the others too, Yoni, Gladis, Estelle and Nikko who cracked us up. The buffet had a great breakfast. Sure, the buffet gets tiresome after a few days, but that\u2019s true in every hotel I\u2019ve been to. The food was ok. My advice is to be careful eating the meat. They have trouble cooking the meat and fish all the way through. Take the smaller pieces, they have a tendency to be well done than the bigger pieces or just ask them to re-cook it. Rooms: We stayed in Bldg. 1 and 3 for the first week. After our return from Cozumel we were in Bldgs. 4 & 5. I\u2019m not quite sure what some of the reviews are complaining about. Ours, both times, were very clean, spacious and not dated at all. It\u2019s typical of what you\u2019d find at a 3.5 to 4 star in any of the Caribbean countries. Our first room had a loud AC unit. My boyfriend fixed that with electrical tape he brought with him. Some comments on here gripe about the fee for a safe. Every All Inclusive I\u2019ve been to has charged for a hotel safe. It\u2019s not unusual. My note of caution though is to be careful of getting a bill for water you did not drink! Report it to the reception desk as soon as it happens. It happened to us twice. I think a worker helped themselves to the water. I think this because my watch also went missing when this happened. Hence the importance of the safe!! Excursions: There is so much to do in the Mayan and this area is so rich in culture and history. We took trips to Chichen Itza, Ek Balam, and Tulum ruins. We also went to Xcaret for the night show. Previously I\u2019ve been to Xel Ha, lots of fun. We walked to Playa several times and shopped at the Walmart, Mega and the Maya Centro mall. The hotel offered a 2 night stay to the El Cozumeleno on Cozumel because they were overbooked. We had intended to go there for a snorkelling trip, so it was great to have our ferry fee and accommodations taken care of. The El Cozumeleno is a nice hotel, well laid out. The beach is like an aquarium. You can walk into the water and see beautiful yellow fish. If you snorkel further along the pier there, you can see clown fish and in the middle, halfway to the buoys you\u2019ll spot a statue. The hotel service on the other hand sucked! The food was not good. We were served wine in plastic juice glasses! And the first night we were there, they had a beach party, cut out all the lights and we had to eat in the dark. Not only that, they ran out of glasses at the bar after the show and we couldn\u2019t get drinks!!! It\u2019s also the first hotel I\u2019ve been to where the alcohol was measure when they made the drinks! The rooms were nice, not really different than what you\u2019d find at the Reef. They did not have fridges. The pools were filthy. Any time you looked in the pool you could see an oily film. Even first thing in the morning when you would normally find a pool pristine! I would never go back to the El Cozumeleno but would definitely go back to the Reef Playacar. Return home: None of us got sick during our stay. What made us sick was the food served by Air Transat on the flight back to Halifax. 2 people out of our group ate the dinner served and were violently ill the next day. The others, who didn\u2019t eat, didn\u2019t get sick.

When we returned home we read reviews about people becoming ill (mostly during August) and also being disappointed in the hotel for various reasons. When we arrived, of course we took note of the gloves worn in the dining areas and we'd never before been asked to use hand sanitizer at a restaurant, but it wasn't until coming back home that we learned why. My husband has a cast-iron stomach but I'm sensitive to everything--however, I never once felt sick from the food or even the water (some reviewers have questioned the water in terms of drinkability and bathing). Our shower was fine, the room didn't smell musty at all, and we had absolutely no complaints about the cleanliness. My only complaint was that the wireless connection (unfortunately, I had some work to do) was hit-and-miss. Sometimes we could get a connection from our room and other times we needed to go a small computer room off the lobby; the connection worked just fine in that room and I'd recommend asking about it, because for the first several days that I needed an internet connection we were only advised to try connecting at one of the open tables in the lobby area--I wish we'd been told about the other room right away. True, the food was limited, but I was happy with fresh fish every night (and to-order pancakes in the morning), and the chef sometimes made it for me even when we arrived at the restaurant toward closing time. The beach was gorgeous and we also enjoyed the pools--the pools were very clean when we were there. Though not as fancy as the resort we'd stayed at the previous year, nothing makes me happier than being able to get a dry beach towel all day long; the previous year our five-star resort didn't supply towels outside and only renewed them in the room and only every other day, so we had to live with damp towels. My husband and I love the water and it's hard to find much energy to go into town other than to do a couple evenings of walking about to enjoy the sights and sounds in the streets and look for special crafts (check out La Sirena for these--the wrestler paintings are especially great) . If you're not there for spring-break-like drinking and partying and are happy with a modest meal after a long day of being out at the beach (including snorkeling around the man-made reef right off the beach--good variety of fish and crabs and even an anemone or two--and a few games of volleyball starting at about 4 PM), you'll not be disappointed in this resort. By the way, we arrived in the same shuttle as another Bay Area couple, and with kids, who'd been to the resort several times over the years. They liked it for its friendliness and coziness. We saw them often and they never mentioned a thing about any of them feeling sick or otherwise being disappointed in any changes they'd taken note of since their last trip. I'm giving the Reef high marks in this review. Not really in comparison to more expensive and fancier places I've been to, but for how it is, in itself, a nice place for those who aren't seeking the ultimate partying or pampering (though that's available) vacation experience but want something a little more down-to-earth.", "Date": "April 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati", "Title": "\u201c!!!!Reprehensible!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "hasher", "ReviewID": "UR28643878", "Content": "To begin, this was our second (2) experience with the Reef.

It seemed obvious to return to a place we were familiar with for our five year anniversary trip. Bad option. Terrible option. I made a terrible lapse in judgment! I requested a room for my wife and I to have a king sized bed; approximately two (2) weeks in advance. (did not happen) So, to start our 5 year anniversary trip, we got two small double beds. The next day, we were able to convince the staff after pleading, to change rooms. But, the room we got did not have an operating AC unit! Therefore, after several trips to the front desk, we were told that the only available room was located in the back of the facility, with construction, and right next to the service entrance with buses, delivery trucks, and more. Great!!! FOOD: food was passable at best. Breakfast was sometimes OK. Most of the food was poor. Sickness: I would say roughly 85% of the occupants contracted diarrhea and/or vomitting.

We knew going in that it was not a luxury resort, at $1200 USD for two people/six nights, but it barely lived up the to mediocrity promised. I'll start with the negatives: The staff is utterly unresponsive or caring. The front desk takes a minimum of 3 requests to get what you asked for (maybe we were trying to hard not to be THOSE Americans), the all-inclusive actually isn't. I'm not so sure you can claim to be all-inclusive when you charge extra for such luxury items as Malibu rum, or cheesy beach entertainment with food that was only edible. Drink service on the beach was, despite assurances to the contrary, nearly non-existent. On multiple days the server came around promptly at 11am, and despite a 50 peso tip from us and various tips from others, he did not return for the next 6 hours. Do not be assured that the room you requested will be the one you are assigned, we booked a king, but received a room with two doubles. To their credit, we were moved the next morning, though we heard similar stories from others. Despite the move to a larger bed, I think the floor may have actually been softer, I was thankful to get home so I could get a full night's sleep without tossing and turning. They were doing some construction in the service alley behind the rooms' buildings. Not bad in and of itself, except the workers would start between 4-6 am with tools, hammering, etc., NOT cool when on vacation. The food was edible, that's the best I can say. The breakfasts were usually good, the lunches were saved only by the pasta bar, and save your time by avoiding the two \"reservations-only\" restaurants. The buffet was passable for dinner. The other two restaurants actually lied on the menus about their food. An example: My wife's romaine lettuce salad with grapefruit and orange slices drizzled with a light citrus dressing turned out to be anemic iceberg lettuce with grapefruit rind and doused with a frenchy kind of dressing. They argued with you when you notified them that the lettuce was not what the menu said. Either they were ignorant, or thought we were stupid. We don't expect to be pampered. At all. I just wish that the all-inclusive was truly that, and that the service was more prompt and friendly. The positives: Antonio at the pool area (he collects empty plates and cups) was the only employee I recommend tipping. Especially as he will occasionally go above his duties and go get a drink for you in the unserviced pool area. He is friendly, funny, and what all employees at other resorts we've been to were like. The reef should give him a raise and use him as an example for every other employee. The pasta bar at lunch is very good and I recommend it (avoid the rest, though). The grounds are absolutely gorgeous and you will feel like you're in the jungle with all the Agouti, Iguanas, and Geckos running around. The beach was wonderful! It is as turquoise as the pictures promise. It is warm, relatively calm, and the sand is some of the softest I have been on. For the price, this wasn't terrible, but it didn't really live up to even the mediocre reviews we read before booking. Proud and solid regular I could have handled, but consumer promised regular and resort promised luxury made what we got seem all the worse. If you don't need pampering and spoiling and just want a beautiful beach to dip your toes into (as long as you book without the all-inclusive), this resort should work for you.

Their omlets were awesome and the rice-yummy! The 2 reastaraunts were just ok. I recommend the Riveria Mayan drink (with the Pina Colada on top) at the pool bar, it's the best drink ever!

The resort is kind small comapred to the Riu that is next door. We had not booked a room with a king size bed but asked for one when we checked in and got one right by the pool! The rooms smell like any other room I have been in, in Mexico. The pool wasn't over crowded. There were still chairs and cabanas left at like 9am. There isn't any music that gets played by the pool which is kind of a bummer. Althought there was a group who had brought down an iPod docking station one day and that was great!

The entertainment was a lil cheesy but they knew it was which made it fun, entertainment staff is top notch, lots of fun always around to have a drink with you or chat. Beach was gorgeous, water was a lil rough but still was able to go in, never a problem finding a spot on the beach or pool area. Very close to playa del carmen downtown area, which was nice for shopping and a little culture. I recommend going into town to book tours as we got a great deal on a tulum and xel-ha package (AMAZING TOUR!!!!). Drinks and food are always plentiful and available, fantastic mojitos. The only downside to this amazing trip was the food at the resort, if you are going here to enjoy top notch food, you need to book elsewhere. the buffet is palatable at best, the snack bar has no order to it and is very bland and greasy. The italian restaurant is borderline inedible! we didnt finish are food and got up and left......very very gross. all in all the perfect vacation (we werent there for the food we were there for the atmosphere the beach and the drinks). dont listen to the people knocking this resort, they obviously did little research. this is not a luxury resort it is a quiet villa style outdoor style resort.", "Date": "March 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burleson, Texas", "Title": "\u201cWould definately stay there again\u201d", "Author": "andreak02", "ReviewID": "UR25780296", "Content": "We just stayed at The Reef Playacar the last week of Feb 2009. This is a smaller resort which in my opinion makes it really nice. There were visitors from America, Sweden, Germany, Canada and Italy. Young kids, seniors, married couples, life partners, teens, all had a good time. We are a married couple in our forties. We are the outdoorsy type. Police officer and Pet Sitter. We usually stay on Cozumel but we wanted to get away from the crowded Cruise ship scene. We had a wonderful time and here is our review...scale is from 1-10 with 10 the best: STAFF: 10 Probably the friendliest you wil find. I think that the staff really appreciates it if you at least attempt to speak Spanish. This will surely bring a smile to you and everyone else. Say gracias or no gracias when asked if you would like more cafe or vino blanco (white wine). more basic spanish greetings at YouTube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FU4uvsKlMr4 Entertainment staff offers yoga, spanish lessons and water aerobics. FOOD/ DRINKS: 8 The buffet food was good and fresh. Victoria makes the best omelettes. By day 4 we were ready to venture out and eat a couple of dinners out on 5th Avenue, but we always ate breakfast at the buffet. Food was good, hot or cold as required. At the juice bar you can have them make you your own designer drink. Bar drinks were a little watered down, that is normal in an all inclusive no matter where you stay, just tip a little and they will make them stronger. Check out the ice cream stand near the lobby. ROOMS: 7.5 Rooms are older but comfortable and clean. Cold A/C, HBO, Tile floors,nice balcony, fairly large bathroom with good water pressure . Lots of closet space. Water is purified. They do charge for the bottled water, so go down to the little store and get your bottled water for 1/4 of the room bottle price. Little refridgerater in room. These rooms are bungalow style. We particularly like the semi rustic feel. You will not find the fancy schmancy shiny marble walls and floors here. We did see 1 waterbug. POOL AREA: 10 Giving it a 10 because the pools were very clean, plenty of loungers for all, and several neat Egyptian beds. Swim up bar, nearby snack bar and another drink bar. Hot tub is not hot, but who cares when the weather is warm! BEACH: 10+ Totally the prettiest I have seen. NO rocks, soft powder white sand. hammocks, plenty of loungers for all, volley ball other activities. We walked down the beach and the other resorts' beaches were dirty. The Reef Playacar reef was gorgeous and clean. GROUNDS: 10+ NATURAL. This resort has at least 2 natural cenotes. The center area is lush with jungle like setting. Large deck for gathering and watching wildlife. You will cross paths with several agouti, large squirrel like creatures without tails and a few large iguanas and small black lizards. The birds will sing for you in the morning, just open the balcony door! Flowers as big as your hand. Beauty at every turn. See pics AREA: 9 You can just walk to town. Lots to buy and eat. We ate at Sushi Itto sushi bar in town. Delicious and fun to watch them prepare your meal. There is a small coffee shop at the ferry station. The ferry cost us 22us for 2 tickets to Cozumel, buy one way at a time. Don't buy round trip tickets. In Cozumel we explored the far side of the island and went on the History of Tequila tour where you get free sips of flavored tequila. Xcaret: a must see, beautiful. They will tell you all restaurants are $29us per person, but we found a snack bar by the theater that had hamburgers for 8us. lockers are 3us, you really don't need fins to snorkle river so save some money there too. Show starts at 6 pm dont miss it! OTHER INFO: Money exchange; pls ck the rates before you go at http://www.oanda.com/convert/cheatsheet and print it out. That helped us alot. Some taxi drivers and other vendors say $5us = 50 pesos. That is not true. We paid 50 pesos for a cab to town which = 3.25us. When we were there, 1us=14 pesos. Taxi to or from airport is 50us. Anything more, they are ripping you off. TIME SHARE people at Reef-politely decline. TIME SHARE people at another resort-Avoid but if you know how to deal with these aggressive people and can cut it off at 90 minutes, you can work it in your favor. Have a signal to each other and wear a watch. Here is how we did it. This one was Tres Rios Resort. They promised 2 Xcaret tickets for total $60. Before getting to their resort,we added that we wanted 2 round trip ferry tickets to Cozumel and transport to and from Xcaret. They agreed and we got it in writing. So after 90 minutes we said NO and we wanted to leave, they sent over the manager to try to salvage the \"sale\",again we said NO,we are ready to leave. We want our tickets. So they deducted 44us for the RT ferry tickets from the 60us we owed for the Xcaret tickets. We got the 2 Xcarets tickets and transport to and from Xcaret for only 16us. Usually this would have cost about 170us. Although the entire staff was very friendly and accomodating, we would like to especially mention Erika, the Conciere, and Jorge, the Bellman, who helped us with an honest transport company to the airport after we got ripped off by AXIA Transfers which overcharged us $30us for transport to the hotel. FYI the normal rate is $50us to or from Cancun airport to Playa del Carmen.

The grounds are scenic, pretty and quaint, amid a multitude of hacienda-style villas. However, the activities team is pitiful. They had scheduled events but rarely followed the schedule. You would see them run the morning pool-side step aerobics, and then not see them again for hours. When they actually did run an activity, they might, or might not, even announce it. The activity team would even walk by you without making any eye contact or even say hello. To me, the manager of the activities team (whoever that was) needs to be fired, and replaced with someone with experience and a desire to focus on the enjoyment of their guests, rather than their own. The meals were repetitive, but had solid quality and a good taste. The service, however, was sub-standard. The people who worked there tried their best, but they were under-staffed - thereby resulting in overall poor service. In addition, the staff did not speak English well enough - to the point that the server could not tell you what she was serving. The pool and beach area was very nice. It was always easy to get a lounger. The resort had a hot tub near the beach, but it was cold and never worked. The first night we got there they had over-booked and they sent us to the Iberostar Quetzel which made us think we should have booked elsewhere than the Reef. Overall, a smaller resort with nice grounds, beach and pool areas - but definitely not a 4 star resort. It is very poorly run and managed. We would strongly recommend that travellers spend that little bit more (as we will next time) to upgrade to a true 4 star resort like the Riu and Iberostar.", "Date": "February 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bulgaria", "Title": "\u201cNice vacation\u201d", "Author": "DaniBulgaria", "ReviewID": "UR25096084", "Content": "We were 2 weeks from 29.01 to 14.02.2009.

Only issues; you have to get there bright and early to make dinner reseravations and the mexican restaurant was closed 2 days during my stay for a private party/wedding and only found out about it after I waited an hour in line to make reservations, plus you need pants for the guys and of course I packed no pants for my husband or 3 sons and everytime I went to the restaurant with them not wearing pants I had to explain to the manger.

My husband and I did upgrade to the gold bracelet to get top shelf booze and recommend to do that if you are drinker, cost us an extra $50 for the week and totally worth it.

I had no problems with my room average size 2 double beds, clean, a very nice welcome note was in my room. I loved that I did not have to walk too far to get to the resturants, front lobby or the beach . It is not your typical hotel set up which I also thought was very nice. The rooms are in small buildings about 3 stories high. They do have a newer upgraded section also. The grounds were well kept and as I walked around there were cleaning up after the guests. The buffet resturant was also small as compared to other area hotels but they only cater to about 200 rooms , and they had a good variety of foods. The speciality resturants,which you had to make reservations , were excellent and worth the reservation, just make sure they give you a card saying you have a reservation. The front desk staff was friendly. They have a nice open air bar above the main lobby. There is a tour desk but you might get a better price for tours on the 5th street , which is a small walk from the hotel. Just say no to the time share sellers. The hotel is in a nice quite area and we felt very safe walking on the streets. Tip: If you do any tours exchange some of your money for pesos, the exchange rate is better in town than it was in the smaller towns by the ruins.

Friends who had been to the area before selected this resort based on a combination of the number of restaurants, beach, walkable location and low-price for a packaged air/resort deal. The buffet food was well-prepared, varied, and beautifully presented. Cooks at three grill stations were always willing to cook fish, chicken, eggs or pasta toppings to order. Dessert cakes, while good-looking, were not as sweet as those in USA -- we learned to look for the flan (custard) desserts squares which were tasty, and the fresh fruit. The buffet restaurant area has a lovely view of the beach and sea. At the reservation-restaurants, we prefered the Mexican Grill over the Italian, for variety of offered selections and taste of main courses. Heavy rains 2.5 days of the vacation week magnified some of the downsides of this smaller resort. Two outdoor bars and two small outdoor snack restaurant areas weren't comfortable to access in the rain. The small main lobby was the only indoor area for more than 2 people to sit at times other than meals or the late-evening show. The many stairs on the winding walkways and up/down to rooms in the small buildings were tough to walk safely when wet. Water leaked in the restaurant roof and slat windows. Smoke from cigarettes lingered and was unavoidable. Staff worked very hard to sweep and mop water, but those almost-outdoors areas so nice on a sunny day were uncomfortable in the wet conditions. If more than a day of rain is forecast for your visit, consider staying at another place with more public areas and indoor corridors to rooms. If anyone in your group has trouble climbing stairs or walking uneven paths, this is probably not the best resort for you. The lush gardens were a pleasure to walk through, and small animals interesting to watch. Note that except for 1 bug none appeared inside the room. Room quality varied and front desk staff did not always know room condition, so first/second room assignments on arrival needed to be changed. There are no smoke-free rooms or public areas (lobby itself is non-smoking, but smoke blows in from the doorways). Some rooms were recently remodeled, some under construction, some with patio doors that did not lock (used a chair to brace closed). Cleaning service was great but towel quantity and delivery timing varied, so timing a mid-day shower was problematic. It was easy to walk towards town and view several ruins areas, and also to walk outward and enjoy the street-side landscaping of nearby resorts. A very nice small shopping area is a few blocks away, opposite direction from town. Beach walking was OK - nice views of Cozumel island, interesting to see beach facilities of other resorts, no shelling or snorkling sites adjacent to property.

Come to think of it, just have fruit and yogurt for breakfast and the rest will fall into place; no need to gorge (which we tended to do at first) Recommend a day trip to 5th Avenue for variety (think lobster tacos).

Once you go through customs and immigration (very little hassle) and having to press your luck (lit. green means go, red means no and you get searched). you are welcomed to the country by hoards of timeshares and vacation/tour programs looking to get your business. If you didn't arrange for transportation beforehand, this is where you will find them. 2) Transportation - A van took us along with a few other couples to our respective resorts/hotels, dropping off in order of destination. Not really scenic as you are on the Highway most of the time. It's not until you get to your hotel/resort that you actually see what you paid for. Don't forget to tip a small amount to driver... 3) Reef Club welcome - Some bell boys come out and help lug out your stuff from the van and take you to check in. Even before speaking to the counter desk an information host is already talking to you about arranging a tour of the facilities and such (more later). The check in process is fairly simple and straightforward. Afterwards the bellboy will bring your luggage to your room (tip optional in all-inclusives). The information host would also ask you about joining any tours if you hadn't booked one by then, but there are some guidelines to look for (more below). We were able to get comfortable before hitting the buffet luncheon which offers mostly Mexican staples and some standard favorites along with drinks and fruit. Once you finish you will need to find stuff to do, as there is only so much at the resort. I suggest biking/walking into town (about five/fifteen minutes depending on which mode). Walk around town for that day to get a feel for what they can offer as well as to find the best prices in town for your gifts/souveneir needs. 3b) Amenities - Two pools, work out gym, rinsing shower outside, total access to private beach front, three dining choices (buffet, Mexican or Italian upscale - RESERVATIONS REQUIRED FOR MEXICAN/ITALIAN UPSCALE, guys need slacks and shoes ladies anything goes). Bike rentals (9-5pm, break between 2-3 for staff lunch), pool tables, foozball, five bars all inclusive but watered down drinks, beach beds, snack bar (pizza, burgers fries, sandwiches etc), jewelry/gift shop. Residences: this is an older establishment so things don't look/feel as new as other resorts in the area. Expect occassional bug/ant in bathroom area (my girfriend saw a playing dead roach in the tub) and the paint is cracking a tiny bit with some discoloration/mildew formation. Definitely more rustic and traditional than newer ones. 4) Departure/Check out from Reef Playacar - No one gives a crap about you when you leave. You get there and immediately get pampered to all your whims and desires (within reason), but then when you are dressed like you are getting ready to board a plane (as we were) no one pays any attention to you, it's a totally different vibe you get, like they just want you out of there and it would be a total waste to make you feel welcomed even upon leaving the premises. Airport check-in also was totally different, nobody is looking to sell you any packages anymore, only some stores to offer souveniers at marked up prices (in US DOLLARS even!) 5) Overall - Arrival was nice, just quite hectic imho. I think it was just because it was our first time, but you live you learn. The Reef Club also offered alot of food variety, but only to a point; after three days we were 'Reefed Out' of the choices and decided to try local stuff in town, a welcome change from the same ol' same ol'. Support local business right? I totally suggest you order some mexican breakfast favorites like huevos rancheros and huevos mutolenos (both eggs dishes essentially). The drinks were all complimentary and included in the cost, but mostly watered down and not the best quality. The beach was indeed a nice view, but the waves were very choppy and violent. Make sure you stay within the confines of the sand bars or you run the risk of getting swept away into the Caribbean! The activities at the Reef were pretty standard: bars, live music/dance shows, casino, etc. You definitely get much more of the Mexican flavor wh en in town. Once in a while they have vendors on-site to sell trinkets and cuban cigars (which I was tottally tempted to get). The snack bar offered burgers, fries, ribs and ice cream for the wee hours/between lunch/dinner. Overall okay, the burgers were frisbees (well done plus) and the ribs were a bit cold. Fries were much better quality, and their cheese/milk products taste a bit different than what is in the USA. it's up to your palette to decide. The check out process - Make sure you know your flight time. Ours didn't leave until 1:00pm but the van came to pick us up from the hotel at 9:00am... kinda early, but judging by the drivers (lack of) knowledge of the roads to other resorts, it was a good thing to add in the extra hour. However that meant we were able to enjoy ourself one hour less (no beach, no bike, quick eats). Also the tours that they can book at discounted prices on site... you need to fulfil some certain requirements to be eligible: a) Be between like 30 - 54 years old b) Married (spouses must also participate in tour) c) Must be US/Canada/Mexico residents (all parties involved) d) Submission of credit card number There might have been a few more but that was the gist of it. We got a notice to confirm with the host but never did, and they never even contacted us about participating. That was a good thing for the following reasons: - Tours lasts about 1:30 hours, time I rather spend sunning on beach / biking to town - Alot of emphasis on timeshare selling which we were not interested in - Safer/more reliable tours but rather go find one cheaper in town I have read reviews on here that said they hound people who didn't confirm and actually show displeasure at not appearing. I don't know what they are complaining about, as this is an all-incluside getaway that means we deserve treatment as we wish it, on our time, not on theirs. Don't get sucked into thinking that you NEED to join this tour, you will probably end up wasting your time. Of course maybe that's why we were not treated as well upon our departure, the world may never know. Hope this summary review helps those looking for an all-incluside at the Riviera Maya. Sounds kinda generic but I'm sure that's how they do it at other resorts as well, unless you go to a Riu or Sandos property (more upscale) Ratings (out of 10, 10 is best) Service - 8 definitely want you to feel welcome while you are there but nothing else when you are about to leave Food (buffet/snacks) - 7 gets boring after a while but it's all free Location - 9 one of the closest to town, so walking is s breeze, however Riu Palace is right next door with much better stuff, might want to consider that Amenities - 7 older, more rustic, watch out for small nuisances (ants, lizards, etc nothing poisonous though Overall - 7 3/4 You could always do better, but if the price is right and you know how to work the staff, by all means it's totally worth it.", "Date": "December 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Barbara, CA, USA", "Title": "\u201cHad afantastic stay!!!\u201d", "Author": "Yoshi23", "ReviewID": "UR22759912", "Content": "I have been a hotel manager in Southern California for the last 10 years. As such, I have a pretty fair idea of what to expect from a staff. So it's always fun and enlightening to be on the other side of the desk. This trip was no exception. After doing a ton of research, I booked our stay for the period of December 6th to 13th through LocoGringo, which turned out to be a good idea. They responded rapidly, and helped me narrow down my choices. They really know their stuff! Upon checking into the Reef Playacar, we were informed (as someone below was, I note) that the air conditioning had failed in the entire building that we were staying in. So they put us up at the Sandos Playacar, just down the road for one night. It was nice, but compared to the Reef Playacar, we found it rather lacking in character. Though the room was a bit more upscale than the one we eventually ended up in at the Reef, the grounds were unremarkable and reminded one of staying in Vegas. All stucco and building, without the amazing plant and animal life that's all around you at the Reef lacking. This is not a slam on Sandos, merely a nod toward the amazing gardens at the Reef Playacar. Although we'd read extensively about it, we never tired of the buffet. We found that, quite contrary to the experiences of other guests claiming that the choices were limited, we were offered a variety of tasty meat dishes, cooked right in front of us and served fresh, a big assortment of fruits, and some decent salad mixes. The staff in the buffet room (Chula Vista) were extremely helpful, cheerful and attentive. Our margaritas never had a chance to run dry, nor did the smiles of the employees. The room we had (#822) was on the second floor and overlooked an amazing hanging garden area, with soothing music that was piped through the area the entire time. At night, it's really enchanting to walk their grounds. When we checked in on our second day, we were indeed met by one of the time share people, who offered us discounts on travel packages to Chichen Itza and Xcaret, in exchange for two hours of our time to listen to their time share schpiel. We told the lady that we'd consider it the next day, but just wanted to check into our room. She never pressured us after that, and we still went to Chichen Itza, paid full price ($77 per person and well worth it!) and that was that. There are indeed a lot of time share people there, and they are always wanting to talk to you about their amazing offers, but a simple \"no thank you\" will put them off. Eventually, they just leave you alone. It's not really that big of a hassle. Also, there are time share people ALL OVER Playa Del Carmen, even at the \"Information Centers\". It's just a fact of life down there. If they hassle you, just tell them you've already got your tickets for all the places they'll try and pitch you and they'll leave you be. The beach and pool facilities at the Reef Playacar are wonderful. You can check out snorkel equipment, kayaks, and jet ski's for free. Or just lay out at the beach. Women are required to wear tops at the pool area, but we noted that several women were topless at the beach itself and no one seemed to mind. I would caution those who check out beach towels to remember to return them by the end of your stay, or they will charge you $25 per towel. They weren't exactly forthcoming with this fact, but maybe they just forgot. Regardless, we turned our towels in at the end and were not charged. Also, as to the water bottles, we never drank them and were not charged for them, either. All in all, even with the first night's relocation, we had a splendid time at the Reef Playacar. Stephanie, who works the \"guest services\" desk, was especially helpful! She must speak at least 4 languages, and speaks English perfectly. My Spanish is passable, and that helped in some situations at the Reef, but most of the people who work there speak some English. The property itself is lovely. It's also the closest all inclusive resort to downtown PDC. The short 10 minute walk to town has two separate Maya ruin sites on the way. Advice to people who are staying at the Reef, and also travelling to Mexico in general: RELAX!!! If you can just be patient and remember that it's a 3 diamond, and not a 5 diamond property, and also that you are in Mexico, where things just seem to happen a bit less quickly and efficiently than you're used to, you will have an excellent time of it.

Overall we had a great time. We made a lot of plans for trips to XCaret and Cozumel, but ended up laying on the beautiful beach every day. The Reef has the best bit of beach in all of Playacar. Most resorts have their private beach fenced off from the ocean to keep it more exclusive. The Reef was very open and club feeling during the day with beach volleyball and morning stretch classes The drink selection wasn't of the highest quality, but we made do. The buffet restaurant, Chula Vista, offered a nicer drink selection than any of the other bars in the hotel. The entire staff was completely friendly and accommodating. We especially liked the entertainment staff. They took care of everything from step aerobics to evening shows. The night life isn't much to brag about at the resort but after a long day at the beach it is nice to just play a game of pool and have a few drinks. However, the party scene in Playa Del Carmen on calle 12 (12th St.) is definitely worth checking out if you like to dance. The food was fine. We weren't too picky. We did go out for dinner in town one night just to mix it up a bit. The only negative was that our shower flooded our bathroom every time we used it. I would recommend asking for a room on the top floor due to the noise of the cleaning staff. We were up and out by 8am every morning but they starting banging around at about 6:30-7am.

The resort is compact and very shady, which is a great benefit, given the abundance of sunshine around. Rooms were comfortably spacious, pretty clean. I would recommend to ask for the rooms closer to the waterfront, or away from the main lobby and disco club - at night it might be a problem if you are sensitive to noises.

The drinks were also delicious and plentiful, quick service too. We were told that the resort was 98% full, but we didn't feel crowded or like we had to wait too long for anything. The room was nothing extraordinary, but clean and comfortable. The shower and air conditioner worked great. We tried the Terrazza Grill and the Boticelli restaurant and really enjoyed our meals at both places. The waitstaff did a great job, too. The Chulavista buffet was alright. I didn't find that there was much variety from day to day, we didn't like the coffee, and the pasta was really bad. We did like the service we received there, though. There was always enough of a selection that you could find something enjoyable at every meal, but I wouldn't call it gourmet by any means. We found that the pool snack bar was disorganized and the pizzas were always served undercooked..The cheese wasn't melted yet. Also, twice when we went at night for a snack (hours before closing time), we discovered that they had decided to close early. Playa del carmen was a short walk away, and we enjoyed walking into town quite a few times. The front desk staff told us a taxi would only cost $5.00, but we chose to walk to and from everytime. It's a nice walk as long as the weather cooperates. We did an excursion to Chichen Itza, and a day in Cozumel. We went a little too late to Cozumel, so I would recommend getting up early to take the ferry over. We had to meet with a rep from a tour agency at the hotel to book our return trip home.

If you are looking for a five star resort, this is NOT the place for you, but if you are looking for a modest three star resort with good value for your money, you have found the right place. On our arrival, we were immediately assigned a room.The room that was assigned was rather musty smelling. That is actually understandable as it is in the middle of a jungle setting with lots of foliage and shade. Upon return to the front desk to request another room, Pablo was more than responsive to listen to my complaints of must and mold allergies. He escorted me, personally, to a few other rooms that were available. I finally settled for a room with two full size beds, rather than a king size bed, but were pleased with the rooms cleanliness and lack of smell. Overall, the room was cleaned appropriately daily and served its purpose. I do agree with other reviewers in that the walls are rather thin and outside sound can be a disturbance, As a side note, I did not find the beds to be uncomfortable as others have reported but I did have to request other pillows after day one. The water for showering was always hot with fairly reasonable water pressure. The best parts of this resort are the food, restaurants,service and beach. We ate in both of the restaurants,Italian and Mexican and found them very good.The buffet always had a variety of food and the breakfasts were always good. Contrary to what others have said, I found the snack bar to be quite bad. The hamburgers tasted like something other than beef and the hot dogs were still frozen. The alcohol was always plentiful ( not watered down, as some other all inclusive resorts have been known to do)but there were times when a small wait ( 5 - 10 minutes) was neccesary, as the bartender was busy washing/rinsing glasses. When I go back, I would bring my own glass and ask for it to be refilled when needed.Dont forget to try the lobby bar, as that was our favorite! In general the wait staff were always pleasant, most spoke English well and were aiming to please. It seems that the waitstaff has gone out of their way to promote cleanliness since \"the OUTBREAK\". By the way, it appears that they have eradicated the problem as I heard no one complain of illness and every one on our trip ( 4 of us) remained illness free. The beach was AMAZING.

On our first night they had an Independence clelebration, the food was great. They are a little limited with the drinks available at the open bar but for someone who really doesn't drink Pina Coladas were fine with me. The staff was very nice, we met a great group of people and went out with them one night. The buffet food selection was the only dissapointing thing, it always seemed to be the same we only ate lunch and breakfast twice and dinner there once. The beach was amazing, beatiful and the graounds were very nice. We went to Xcaret which was also amazing. Wish we would have gone there 2 days because 1 is just not enough. My advise is to purchase the plus package, you get more for your money. We also did the Swim with the Dolphins, another great experience. Our last night there we went to El Aluxe restaurant...WOW this place is beautiful and the food is great. A litle pricey but worth it. It's in a Cave and beautiful...a must see. A taxi to 5th ave from the hotel is just $5, you could walk it but we did it once and figured the $5 was worth it. You could pay outrageous fares to visit Tulum, XeHA or Xcaret but there is a bus depot on 5th ave you can take to these places for $3 each way. We booked the hotel on one of those travel timeshare specials so we only had free transportation to the hotel but not back to the airport...this would have cost $75...we took a bus for only $8 back which droped us at the airport terminal 2. The buses are new with air and very comfortable. OK sorry for being so winded here but we really did have a great time and can't wait to go again...yes we would stay at the Reef again too...loved it!

Both of these are transmitted through feces.It is often found in foods that are not cooked and It is also prevelent in some pools. This may explain why the resort tested the pool water one morning and drained it mid-afternoon.I am also quessing the pool is where we got it as many of us did not eat the same food as each other , especially the baby and he was one of the first to get sick.I also noticed the hotel putting out animal traps around the resort.

We ended up staying there for 5 fun nights with no real complaints. We met up with friends making us a group of 9. Upon arrival, my boyfriend and I were greeted by very friendly staff and were NOT hassled by timeshare people at all. Other than sleeping, we hardly spent any time in our room which was clean, bug-free, and the A/C worked just fine. The resort's beach was beautiful and there were always available beach chairs. We primarily ate at the buffet where the food was pretty good for an all-inclusive buffet, but after eating there over and over again, the selection gets a little old. The snack bar was full of your typical junk food like pizza, fries and burgers which was in general good, but definitely not excellent. We did make reservations at the Italian restaurant one night. The ambiance was great, but the food wasn't. It tasted like they made the dishes in the buffet and just brought them upstairs. We left the resort a lot on day trips, and we went downtown a few times for dinner so we didn't eat at The Reef as much as we could have. Because of that, we didn't get too tired of the food. No real complaints. We did notice that were was a virus going around during our stay because we heard a lot of guests complaining and we noticed the doctor making his rounds. We were careful of drinking water or cocktails with ice and eating cold foods at first, but nothing happened to us, and by the end of our stay, we were eating & drinking whatever we wanted. I don't know what it could've been, but I'm a vegetarian, so I didn't touch the meat, and I did not get into the swimming pools. One of our friends saw the staff dump a whole load of chemicals into the pools as if they were doing a major disinfecting. Our group basically just stuck with the beach, and all 9 of us did not get sick. Overall we had a blast. The staff was very friendly and the bars didn't seem like they skimped on the booze either.

Just as the other reviews have been written, this one has the same storyline..First we got there, our bag was rolled in as we were told to go to the reception to check in. So far so good..We had to talk to the \"Meet and Greet\" individual to show us all the features of the Reef. After we spent 30 minutes and $5 we could now go to our room, but our luggage which was rolled in by a staff member was now missing. It was taken by a driver who was taking people to the airport. After 7 hours it was finally brought back. And honestly, I really don't think the staff was all that concerned with our luggage. The next day, our 1st full day in Playa, we layed out, ate and drank by the poolside. I (the boyfriend) drank plenty of water and ate from the snack bar, while my girlfriend drank coke and water and ate as well. We ventured out by bikes to Wal-Mart to get bottled water and snacks since we know that the prices are usually jacked up at the resort. Come Sunday, we had breakfast, then layed out, but then the problem started to occur...The Runs! I was miserable, I was going to the bathroom every 20-30 minutes for the next 3 days. I skipped breakfast and lunch with a few snacks here and there and usually ate something light for dinner. This is the girlfriend writing now. The food was terrible. I am not a picky eater and I do like exotic foods quite often. The breakfast was the best and safest choice, although I did read that people liked the snack bar food. However, I don't think they cook with safe water, or use clean kitchen utensils or something. At first look, the snack bar food is okay and normal, but the more you stay in the snack bar, you notice things. The cups for icecream fell on the floor and I helped them pick it up. I put it on the counter for them to put in the trash and one guy smiled at me and then put them back in the basket! That was so gross. Dinner was the worst. I couldn't even recognize the food and all I ate was one small piece of chicken that was freshly grilled. One day there was spaghetti, and the sauce was pink, like pink strawberry milk. I think that the staff is really disgruntled, because I notice them throwing dishes, and being pissed about things quite often. After I saw them put those plastic cups back, I knew that it was not the only thing that they would do. By that time, our stomachs were achy and starting to hurt. I read all the reviews before and thought, oh, that won't happen to us, or let's just chance it. We thought, the price is good and it's by the beach. However, we ended up not eating or drinking anything else after we got sick. We ended up going out to breakfast/dinner and eating store bought snack in between. We stuck to only bottled beverages and that was it. I had to go to the pharmacy and buy over $20 in medications for my boyfriend and I to feel better. All in all, we ended up spending much more than we would have just because of the bad food and unsanitary conditions. If you end up going and get it, take the medication for the runs in Spanish. It works. Also, bring pepto and tums, and lots of it. I am still not feeling well and we just got back yesterday (9/5).

We had a terrible time at the Reef due to almost everyone at the hotel getting sick, but there is more. Upon our check-in each guest is pressured to attend a time-share meeting before they will show you to your room. When we did get to our room we found out the lock for the room safe was $2. US per day and the bottled water was $5.US as well. This was supposed to be an all-inclusive resort. The food at the buffet was poor and did not change with very little selection (not even milk was offered) the snack bar was late to open by more than a half hour and the cheap cracked plastic cups used for the free drinks were child sized.

Now back to the part about all the people getting sick. We arrived Sunday of last week, after the agonizing sales pitch we went to our rooms and then to the beach. The beach in Playa del Carmen is wonderful by the way. Later that evening I became ill with fever, the runs and throwing up throughout the night. My wife is a nurse and she immediately recognized I had dysentery so she went to the front desk an ordered me the appropriate meds from the local pharmacy. At this point we were unaware of what would soon become an epidemic. The next day after a complete night of toilet use my wife fell ill to the same awful sickness I had. I went to the gift shop to purchase more bottled water since I drank both that were in our room the night before. The lady helping me behind the desk was sick as well and said many others were also sick. I brought the 5 bottles back to our room and checked to see how my wife was doing. My wife called the front desk for yet another order of meds and was told the doctor was at the hotel and for $100 U.S. he would see her if she would like, she declined the visit and ordered the meds. She was told they would be brought to our room (812) in 15 to 20 minutes. After a half hour passed I headed out to see if her medicine was up at the front desk. While on my way to the lobby I noticed we were not alone with this sickness. People on the walkways were asking each other for help and answers to what was happening to everyone, asking if we were sick too. Others that were listening from their balconies added that they had sick people in their rooms. While in the lobby there was a large group of hotel guests surrounding their local travel rep demanding that they be moved to a new location and wanting an answer to what was making them sick. My friend caught up to me and told me he just came from the beach and only a handful of people at the resorts down the way that were full of people out enjoying the sun. I went to the front desk and asked to speak with the manager. With hesitation I was told he was dealing with an emergency, a sick person. I let him know that my wife was in our room sick and I waited to speak with the manager. After a short wait I had a chance to see the manager, he said only 7 people were sick that he knew of and they were looking into the cause, and if the sickness was any fault of the hotel they would be reimbursing the cost of any lost days as well as the cost of medication. He said he was not aware of the people in the lobby outside his glass door or the people in the pathways and I guess not many of the people at the front counter next to his office for that matter. I asked to be moved to a new resort and he said the hotel would not do that unless it was proven they were at fault for the outbreak of illness, but assured me he was doing everything possible and would let me know immediately when they discovered what it was and where it came from. He then said the hotel would pay to have the doctor see anyone that was ill and cover the cost of medicine. I said I did want the doctor to see my wife and the doctor was sent to our room right away and confirmed that she needed medicine and also wrote a prescription for additional meds to stop her from vomiting any more. I called our local travel agent to see if I could get some help and they contacted GOGO travel to let them know what was happening at the Reef. My agent called me back and said they did not have a local rep and they called the resort to see how bad it was and they were told \u201cthe pool\u201d caused the illness and it was already taken care of. I let my agent know my wife was never in the pool and the Hotel manager just told me they had no idea what the cause of the illness was. At this point my agent said she was calling them back and would call again shortly. While waiting for the call I ran the prescription up to the front office. On the way back from the office I saw several more small groups of people and each time I passed one they would ask if I knew what it was and what the resort staff was doing about it. I heard from people that had children so small they were only bottle fed and were sick, elderly people, young and old the illness affected almost everyone. An older British gentleman said he did see someone inspecting the food at the buffet and made the staff remove the deserts and some other foods. While back at our room our travel agent called with a plan. We would be staying a few resorts down the road at Sandos Beach Resort. Olympus Tours would pick us up at the lobby but could not provide a time and it would cost an additional $1,100 U.S. for our group but would be reimbursed as soon as I provided a copy of a checkout bill when we returned. We could not pack our belongings fast enough. While checking out I told the manager where we would be staying and provided him with my cell number. We had meds we were waiting on and the manager stood up and said as soon as I know more I will be personally calling you to let you know what we will be doing \u201cyou have my word\u201d. I asked him why GOGO travel was told the pool caused the illness and he replied \u201cthat is a lie\u201d he said he would be the only person they would have spoken with and they did not call. I asked about the food being pulled out of the Buffett and again he said that was a lie but I could believe what I wanted. We took a Taxi to the new resort and re-started our vacation. Sandos Beach Resort was great. The people were friendly it was clean and the food choices were plentiful. That night the illness caught up to our friends and it took a day to run its course even with proper meds. It was strange that staff from the new hotel as well as the Taxi drivers all seemed to know about the illness from the Reef Resort. Come to find out this is an ongoing event. Two years ago we stayed at the Royal Hideaway and had the time of our lives; we love Playa del Carmen and the local culture. I highly recommend visiting this area, and seeing all the wonderful things it has to offer. I highly It is hard to describe what it felt like to be in such a chaotic health crisis at the Reef in Playa del Carmen. Until the management of that resort begins to take responsibility for the wellbeing of their guests, this is sure to happen again to more unsuspecting vacationers. We never did get a call or the meds we were waiting for from the manager of the Reef Resort. For us, it will be Hawaii next year.

Well, everything I was worried about wasn't true. Here's my assessment. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. The resort has a beautiful layout. I went to the more expensive Rui next door and I would stay at the Reef before I would there. Theirs is too formal and no trees. The Reef has a jungle look to it. It's a quaint propoerty and not too large. the beach is easy to get to. We had a wonderful airconditioner in our room. The maid kept it clean. Granted, it's not a 5-star resort but I didn't expect it to be. The food was fine. The menu could be varied a little, but it was good to me. The service was great, the staff friendly. We left Manuel and Rudy tips (bartenders) 'cause they were our buds. We avoided the timeshare people, just told them no. Probably the only drawback to me is when a property says it's all-inclusive, it should be all-inclusive. The water bottles in the room that they want to charge $5 for is probably ridiculous. I just went to the store and bought me some and that took care of that. No problem. Also, they had a couple of events with food down at the beach that they wanted to charge for, but I wasn't doing that. It's not a party hotel but I wasn't looking for that. The bar at night was fun to me, meeting people from the UK and Canada and Africa. I've stayed at better places, but I would definitely stay here again.

When my wife and I arrived we met some very nice people on holiday and they told us every one is sick. She explained that many of the guests where sick and some had left. So we checked in and immediately after checking in another guest said every one was sick and then a fourth and a fifth person said the same thing. So my wife and I went to the front desk and asked the people at the front desk what was going on and did we have anything to worry about. They said we had nothing to worry about and the guests that where sick where the people that had been there for a week or more and that none of the new guests had complained. So we took it as the truth and went on our vacation. Well the next afternoon our second day at the resort we where told that about 40 people had left the night before and 20 pulse people where leaving that day. My wife and I decided the best thing to do is to leave before we got sick. On our way to the front desk we ran into another couple that arrived the day before we did and they where sick. So being told that the guests that had been there for a week where the only people that got sick was a lie. On top of that the staff is handing out what would be in the states prescription drugs. A doctor was on site making room calls it was scary to say the least. Also they closed down the pools we where told by one of the guests that the doctor told them not to eat the fruit or drink any of the water at the resort this would include any beverage that has water products such as ice. So much for the all inclusive portion of all inclusive resort (don\u2019t swim, eat or drink). My wife and I decided to ask the staff if they could book us into another resort for the rest of the stay. They told us no and said that they couldn\u2019t even refund us for the rest of our stay if we did leave. So we went into town for dinner because we couldn\u2019t eat or drink there unless we wanted to pay for bottled water. We had a great time in Playa del Carmen the highlight of our stay.

I having lived in Mexico for two years of my life thought the complaints were just people being picky, My wife and I learned different. There are some pro's to the con's I will mention the con's first. Con's: Food: I have lived in Mexico for two years (as previously mentioned) so I thought the people who left bad reviews about the food were just being picky because the food was not what they are used to back home (USA, GB, where ever). But the food was not at all impressive, even the Mexican food was a very low quality, and not very authentic. Their selection was not good at all either. The restaurants that are included (the Italian, and the Mexican) are a joke! The Mexican is acceptable, but the Italian restaurant really is not good at all! Lets just say spaghetti and cheap Ragu sauce would have been very welcome compared to their food... The Service: This was perhaps the most disappointing... The service was just not there! There were several employee's who you could tell just really did not care at all... and it appears that the whole organization of the resort feels the same apathy... for example, our last day at the resort we had to catch our plane, so we wanted to eat at the snack bar which opens at 11:00 we were planning on getting a bite to eat before we left... well we went to get some food and the snack bar was not open, the employee told us it would be ten minutes, and then that went by and ten more, and ten more... finally at 11:30 we had to leave... being late was very consistent at The Reef Playacar, and then when we told one of the \"sales/service associates\" in the lobby area about everything running late and how we were not going to have time to eat until 9:00 at night he said, \"oh, I have only been here two weeks, I dont know.\" There was another morning breakfast was supposed to start at 7:00 but they did not open till 7:25 and we had to go to make our tour so we missed out again... Then you ask what is going on and they all shrug their shoulders. There really were several other instances I will not mention just because I could go on. Sales People: The sales people here reminded me of used car salesman... you know the ones that pat you on the back and call you \"buddy.\" They were not ruthless, nor overbearing, but a little annoying. The Pro's The location is awesome! It is centrally located along the Maya Riviera, everything is pretty close... Go to Playa if you want to relax, and do more activities... if you want to party go to Cancun. The beach is great... and I even think the looks of the resort are pretty cool... Really it is too bad, because we thought the place was great! But it would be very hard for us to go back or to advise others to go back, because the service is just not acceptable... the sad thing is that common courtesy would not even cost the company anything, it is just an attitude, an attitude The Reef Playacar does not have.", "Date": "August 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "The Woodlands TX", "Title": "\u201cDont waste your money at the Reef\u201d", "Author": "MexicoMama65", "ReviewID": "UR19251246", "Content": "Please dont waste your money at this resort.

Moved room 3 times before we got one with a working AC. This was an upgraded room after having intense conversations with hotel mgmt and my travel agent. 2. The food was the same over and over and over again. I know it was reused and reheated. Not much variety and almost everyone in our party was sick. 3. It is very understaffed. Could not keep up with towels, cups, etc. The maid service kept turning off our AC everyday when she cleaned. It was 97 degrees outside! 4. The pool was 3 ft low all day one of the days. 5. The resort is very small and very basic. They kept it clean but could not keep up with the demands of a fully booked resort. I could keep listing all the things we went through but you get the drift. Please dont waste your money here. Spend a little more and stay at a nicer resort. They rate this one a 3-31/2 star but it is more like a 2-1/2 star.

We had been up since 5.30 a.m. an hour a half drive to the airport a ten hour flight then standing for 1 and a half hours through customs 3 planes, 4 passport control people, not a good start. Then on bus for 1 and half hours. Got to reef, throwing it down, went to check in, young girl said to leave our cases and then took myself, my wife and son to desk. she started to explain about hotel, we just wanted to get to our room shower and something to eat, at the end of her sales pitch she said you have meeting with me in two days time, to make sure you turn up you give me 100 pesos and you will get it back when I see you. I was too tired to realise what was going on, but next day when I read the slip of paper it was clear I had been conned out of money to force me to attend a time share meeting. This is no way to treat guests at your hotel, you expect that from out in the street, but by people who meet and greet you as soon as you walk in, bang out of order. Kids club, only any good if your kids have a great tan and speak spanish, other wise, your kids are quickly returned to you when the girl takes the others to the beach. We knew kids like ours who went once and never went again, a real real shame. No entertainment for kids during day in pool, geared more towards adults, pool volleyball, water polo, beach volleyball, kids were told to beat it by the entertainment staff at the beach volleyball, I know, I was next to the kid who got to told kids were on later. In the two weeks the kids never got on later. But the entertainment guys and girls were good at what they did, they did do a great show at night for the kids, shame more effort wasnt spent on them during the day, as the entertainment was more for adults, and kids are left round the pool watching the adults play. Location, stunning, beach stunning, staff mostly friendly. Reception, maybe if you pass them a couple of bucks they would get things for you that you need in the room. After 3 days asking for extra coathangers I instead got the maid to get some for me and she did straight away. Sea safe to bath in, snorkel free, go the other side of sandbags and see the fish. amazing. But here come the real bad part, half of the guests came down with sickness, dizzyness and the runs during our second week. Yanks, Brits, Dutch, Hungarians, no one spared. No explanation was ever given to what caused it, no warning, no announcement, no letter to the rooms, but all around you people were not eating, drinking, or even coming out of their rooms. People were dizzy, sick and had no energy. I had this for 6 days, for 35 hours I never ate a single thing, for the rest of the time it was a bit of soup a bit of toast and not much else, I had no stomach for food or desire. At this point you didnt know if it was the food, the water, the pool, the drinks you were served, who knows, it made everyone wary of everything. My son got the runs so did my wife. We ate hardly anything, you felt sick all the time, and then what you did eat came shooting out your backside so fast it nearly broke the land speed record. Trips were cancelled, as you couldnt go anywhere with out being 30 mins from a toilet that you were going to mess up really bad. The doctor was called to most people, 30-40 rooms were affected. At least the Hotel paid for the Doctors fee and tablets, but in my case they didn't even work. Usually when you go on holiday you come back needing to go on a diet, no need at the reef, shed pounds in the sun, the only thing is the toilet basin looks browner than you. The drinks are not cold, they put ice in them to make them cold, is the water they serve really treated, are the plastic cracked glasses they serve the drinks in that clean? Is the food served in the snack bar cooked well enough? One thing is for sure, if you dont finish your snack bar food and just leave it on the table, within 5 secs at least 10 birds like ravens will be all over the plate and the table, the staff do not clear up quickly enough, and the tables are never, ever, wiped clean after the birds have been on them So can I assume that I spent 6 days of my holiday because of bad hygiene, I don't know! Obviously because of the the buffet system we all use the same long spoons to gather the food from tray to plates, so all it takes is one person to be ill, not wash their hands and you can guess the rest. Maybe the above event will never happen again at the reef, but im afraid I couldnt wait to get home, eat some normal food and know where it came from and who made it. This review maybe bitter, but when your son is crying because he didnt make it in time to the toilet and messed up his pants and t-shirt you cant help but feel that someone somewhere should have let people know there was an outbreak and moved us on or something, just anything, we just felt trapped in a sick hotel not knowing what was going on, or how long it would last. Would I come back to the Reef, maybe if I want to lose some weight I will!!! Dont think that going to the Mexican or Italian resteraunts will help, the food in the buffet is better, and the water they serve is warm and cloudy, and I never got to finish my Italian meal, had to leave half way through and then was up at 1 in the morning throwing up, then parking my bum in the toilet seat for an hour.

One, it ranked a hotwire 3.5 stars and a \u201cCustomer Favorite\u201d rating. Two, price. Three the reviews of this resort, although clearly mixed, seemed to favor pleased travelers vs. perturbed trolls. I am writing this while at the resort in an effort not to forget anything that might be considered relevant. It would be fair to warn all readers of this review that my gal and I are both easy to please. We are forgiving of many things that might horrify others so\u2026 if you are relying on our testimony for your decision please keep that relevant fact in mind. I have tried to chronicle the visit with pictures, you know, since they are worth a thousand words (each I might add). Our arrival was a bit confusing but not too difficult to work out if you aren\u2019t bashful and are persistent. Once you clear customs you will be inundated with people, nearly all of whom are trying to get you to visit a time-share although every single one of them will tell you that they are trying to help, and have a multitude of \u201cfree\u201d things to give you. They are very, very tenacious and quite glib in their sales pitch. If you\u2019ve never been to a time-share presentation, I cannot advise you to either try it or run away! As for myself, I\u2019ve seen several and don\u2019t care to waste any of my precious vacation time listening to a hard sell just to receive a few vouchers for \u201cfree\u201d things that cost me the better part of a full vacation day. You be the judge. As you exit customs, keep an eye out for the ADO booth on the left hand side. There you can purchase tickets for the bus to Playa Del Carmen for about $8 or $9 U.S. per person. A taxi will cost probably $75. You cannot miss your stop in Playa; once you arrive, the bus terminal is quite large and basically everyone exits the bus. From there you can take a taxi to your resort which should cost you $5 for a couple (Later we learned that taxis basically operate on a \"flat fee\" $4 for pretty much anything in town and $5 if you go south into the resort area) BTW the fee is the same if you travel from one end of the range to the other or 100 yards. Tip: There will be a row of taxis and people telling you to get in line to wait for one. If you simply walk down the street one to one and a half blocks (remember we had luggage at this point) taxi drivers will begin honking and asking if you need a ride, you can circumvent the long line that way if you\u2019re up to it. At the hotel, check-in was smooth and rather un-eventful. We had a verbal orientation at the front desk and our bellboy basically re-stated the orientation pointing out locations along the way to our room. The orientation is where you begin to hear all of the caveats about restaurants, buffets, pools and bars. In a nutshell they all have hours of operation so it\u2019s not as if you have 24/7 access to everything. After a few days we found that the hours of operation were just a tiny bit annoying. You seemed to have somewhere to go get a bite to eat or a drink just about any time of day, but you might do a little trekking to locate which place was servicing the guests. The room was adequate and as many people have mentioned on trip-advisor had nice cold air, which is a big plus! The toilet handle must be held down for the entire flush if you want everything to go down, so it takes a little longer to flush. On our initial orientation, it was explained to us that the bottled water in the bathroom was NOT in the all inclusive package and if used it would be billed to us at $5 U.S. We too found a few tiny ants in the room, but we weren\u2019t offended as we like the company. The television had 4-5 movie channels although a couple of them were Spanish or Spanish sub-titles, kinda helps you learn the language\u2026 sort of. I was disappointed to see that we did not have CNBC, I\u2019m a market junkie and it doesn\u2019t matter where I am in the world I like to know what the markets are doing. Wireless Internet access is $10/day or $25 for three days, and only available in the lobby but I figure there is an internet caf\u00e9 around somewhere that I can have a drink, catch up on the market and email my friends and family. Neither of us could make the ceiling fan work, we called the front desk last night, they said they would have maintenance come look at it but we haven\u2019t seen anyone. No matter though, like I said\u2026 the room had very nice air. A day or two later the cleaning staff showed us how to turn it on.... The grounds are very nice, very tropical and fairly well kept. As for the \u201cbeached whales\u201d (the breaker bags positioned on the beach to keep the surf down and minimize sand erosion) some people don\u2019t like them, but we found them to be fun! We climbed on them and challenged ourselves with \u201cking of the mountain\u201d activities. They were somewhat difficult to climb up on but fun just the same! My gal loves ice tea. That proved to be a bit difficult to accomplish. First of all, ice can be challenging to obtain depending upon who you ask. Secondly, as far as I know there is one location where you can get \"cold tea\" that is at the bar in the buffet. Another tip might be to bring a large insulated mug from home, save you a few trips back and forth and stays cold longer. We did find out that you can actually buy tour packages at Wal-Mart of all things, and as usual \"Save Money, Live Better\" they were the cheapest. Depending upon your courage and confidence level, renting a car and driving to the ruins is considerably less expensive and more fun. Don't forget long pants for the reservation restaurants. If you don't have them.... they won't accommodate you. We loved the setting, staff, beach, wildlife and guests. Had a good and relaxing time. We aren't night owls so the lack of nightlife at the resort was no problem for us. BTW there is plenty of nightlife downtown if you need to get your fix. The Reef does have a bar on top of the hotel above the reception area that is open until well past my bedtime. We didn't go to any shows so we have no opinion there. Contrary to my earlier statement about time share presentations (they will call it something else to try and convince you it's different) we wound up going on one as a favor to Gus in the lounge. We liked him, he gets paid for it and we got a few benefits, but in the end I left with the same taste in my mouth... I don't like the time share presentation. Lastly, I would say that this would be a good place for children. There was plenty to keep them busy and there seemed to be plenty around. :) I included a couple of pictures of the rodents that live at the resort, they are pretty cute and plentiful.", "Date": "August 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas", "Title": "\u201cWould not go back\u201d", "Author": "Stratta311", "ReviewID": "UR18463119", "Content": "Hotel Rooms \u2013 if you\u2019re a light sleeper bring some ear plugs!

Medical response takes about 27-30 minutes to arrive and none of the staff is trained for CPR or life saving techniques (it seemed as if did not matter to the staff actually).

We booked our trip through JetBlue Getaways and could not have been happier with the service recieved by the airline (we also booked the transfers from Cancun Intl Airport to The Reef through JetBlue--great price and reliable, highly recommend booking the trasnfers as you will be haggled by companies to take you to your hotel). After a 45 minute ride, we arrived at The Reef. Immediatley we were stopped by a man named Alex. He was clearly a timeshare salesman, ready to bug us. We had to wait until the normal check in time (3:00pm) as no rooms were available (we arrived at about 1:00). Our luggage went to the hold room and my daughter and I headed to the buffet for lunch. On our way there we looked around at the buildings of the resort. The grounds were nice, but nothing spectacular. I will not go into detail of what we did each and every day, so here is an overview of the various components of The Reef. Beach- The beach is the best part of this place. Absolutely gorgeous! There are sand bags in the water, but they don;t take away from the beautiful blue color. The sand is soft and white and there are several chairs, some with umbrellas/cabanas and some without. Food- The food at The Reef is not good. The Chula Vista buffet is awful. My daughter got sick. I even took pictures of the food for you to see. We ate at the Italian restaurant twice, the first time it was good, the second time not so much. Service is slow, but there is nothing else going on so it doesn't really matter. We did not eat in the Mexican restaurant. The ice cream parlor is good, I recommend the chocolate chip ice cream. However, it is only open from 3-6. So much for an after dinner ice cream. The snack bar is decent, the nachos and burgers there are good. Drinks are decent, but there are NO STRAWS! Strawberry daiquaris melt fast so they are hard to drink (the ice part) without a straw. Bring a box with you if you like straws. Room- Our room was a recently renovated one, yet nothing special. There were ants in the bathroom as people have mentioned. The shower worked fine, only once did it shut off randomly. Service- It is Mexico, what do you expect? The service is average. Our room was made up around 10 each morning. The staff at the front desk knows a little about getting places but other than that they don't do much else. People complain to them, but it takes awhile to get anything fixed (i.e no hot water in bathroom). Entertainment- The pool staff tries, but to no avail. The shows are awfully but made us laugh. Overall, we enjoyed Mexico, just not The Reef. Playa del Carmen is a lively place and there is always something going on. We took a cab there nightly for $5 each way. Babe's Noodles is a great inexpenisve place to eat in Playa del Carmen. Also if you need the internet, go on downtown as it is only like 25 cents for 15 minutes. We went to the ruins at Tulum by bus. It is VERY hot there, hotter than the beach at The Reef. But it is beautiful and I recommend going. A very cool experience. Would I go back to PDC? Most likely. Would I go back to The Reef? Never. Stay elsewhere. We checked out the Riu next door and didn't want to leave. I guess the saying \"you get what you pay for\" is the perfect description of The Reef Playacar.", "Date": "July 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Port Jefferson Station, New York", "Title": "\u201cHad a great time!!!\u201d", "Author": "scottr73", "ReviewID": "UR18283405", "Content": "My wife and I spent our 20th anniversary at the Reef and had a very positive experience! I did a lot of research trying to find a small but nice place and this was definitely the right place. We flew in during the Tropical Storm Dolly so our first day was kind of a wash out. Although we booked a king size bed, when we arrived they said all they had was a double bed room. We told them that we would wait for a king bed and within an hour we were in a king bed (even in an upgraded room!). We had to move to another room the next morning, but it wasn't so bad because it was on the bottom floor-no stairs to climb. We were one building from the pool and restaurants. The room was quite nice, the bed was comfortable and we had no bugs. The food was very good...after a few days we kind of had our favorites that we kept going back for. We did eat in the Italian restaurant but was not overly impressed with it and we could not get into the Mexican restaurant. Because it was our 20th anniversary we splurged for the romantic dinner on the beach and it was well worth the extra $150 it cost. You would spend that easily on an upscale restaurant anyway! We had our own personal waiter (he only took care of us), a tape player playing Latin love songs, a bottle of Champagne, wine if you wished and a great dinner to go with it. We had the Beef Wellington-it was the best dinner we had all week! The dessert was also fantastic. The staff at the hotel were great although at times it took a little while to get your requests understood but everybody seemed very eager to please. By all means try to avoid the time share sales (unless your interested in this). We were corralled at the airport by some official looking men in white shirts and ties-they made it almost impossible to just pass them by. We were also solicited by the hotel concierge who tried to entice us to take the time share tour (without really telling us it was a time share sales pitch-it was called a welcome tour) promises discounts to a Caribbean dinner, spa treatments and others. We were not interested in this type of offer during our vacation. I did do the additional charge resort scuba dive and was very impressed with the Reef Marina staff. They were knowledgeable and professional, and also remembered my name after one visit to inquire about it. The dive was great with lots of sea life and corals to observe.

My first piece of advise starts at the airport. Try to ignore the tour people that approach you as you exit the airport building to get a taxi or your reserved shuttle to your hotel. Unless you are interested in time shares. Ok, on with our stay. First off, everyone we came in contact with was incredibly friendly. These residents go out of thier way to make sure you are happy. They deserve tips! We tipped our maid every day and brought some pesos down to the beach to tip the waiters there. Don't forget to tip! You will be happy you did. We found the Reef to be pleasant and clean. Very clean. I can't stress enough how tidy everything was in Playa Del Carmen. Even when it rained a couple times there were people out sweeping the water away. Our room was nice, the bed was a bit hard but it worked for us. We didn't see any bugs in our room, actually, I don't remember seeing any bugs anywhere! I did see a couple snakes and lots of geckos on the property, also a large rodent looking animal that was really cool, can't remember it's name, think rabbit crossed with a deer and that's pretty close. We had a beautiful Iguana that lived above our bathroom window and we could see it from our balcony. We took in a couple attractions. Chichen Itza and Xcarat Both are highly reccommended. Try booking a Cancun rides tour of Chichen Itza, it was perfect! Airconditioning and great drinks and snacks all along the way. You can book tours upstairs above the main lobby. We didn't know this until we were taken upstairs to do a seminar, but we backed out because it was taking too long. The food at the Reef is a hit and miss. The snack bar at the pool is open in the afternoon and then again late at night. Very good quesadillas. The buffet is alright, nothing spectacular. If you miss either of these you better have reservations at one of the restraunts there. You have to make reservations between 9 and 10:30 in the morning of the day you want to eat. Oh, and there is no room service. The beach was great! lots of places to lounge, sand feels great, no errosion to be seen. The sand bags out in the water are a lot of fun to get on top of and make for a nice lagoon to swim around in. Don't forget the drinks. They make the rounds and bring you whatever you like. If you want some starbucks, don't worry, there is one on 5th avenue and also one the opposite way across from the Riu Mexico. We ate on 5th Ave. at Los Rancheros. It was very good. But make sure you don't double tip. The tip will already be on the check, we found that out afterwards. They may \"inadvertanly tell you it's tax. It's not. The not so good, not very much :) We were hounded to do a timeshare seminar at the resort. It got to the point that we didn't want to walk through the front lobby anymore. But it didn't ruin our trip :) We had a problem with the A/C in our room. We asked that it be fixed and it never was. We did tell the front desk that we would like another room because of the problem and they upgraded us to an ocean view that became available.

We kept our towels each night, so we could save a spot at the beach/pool (we liked lounging in the beds). Then, we exchanged them for dry towels. At one time, I think we had 5 towels ou :-) The beach was great. The sand bags help with calming the water. If you like waves, swim out to the sand bags-jump over.

Description: - Well decorated and furnished PUBLIC areas. - Two pools, one with a bar inside. One good for kids, the other great for relax. - Clean blue water on the beach... but the bad thing of no rocks or reef in front of the hotel is that you won't see a single fish. - If you don't mind some crows (or something very very similar) picking up food from the plates left around the pool and restaurants, no prob. Pros: - It's not a macro-hotel, so it's very comfortable to go to the buffet or the cookers to get dishes, instead of hundreds of people rushing to reserve a table placing a glass of water, jacket, book, towel, whatever... - Very close to Playa del Carmen - Rooms not miles away from the entrance, as in many All Inc. Cons: - We got the already notorious ants in the bathroom. Not too many, but there they were. - Poor furniture. Worse than mediocre. (we've got pictures. We'll upload them if we have time). - The worst of all: Male waiters seem to be... somewhere else. Or on something... or plain lazy... They try to keep you off the drinks (to save?) and they tell they will bring your drinks. 9 out of 10 they get it wrong... asking for them in perfect Spanish. Painfully slow service. Worse than the mexican average, we've been in other hotels in the area. - Not much variety on the buffet area. Pasta + grilled fish-meat + typical dishes + the cold stuff. That's it. - No ice cream as dessert. You can only go to the ice cream \"restaurant\" when the buffet closes. Again... trying to save? - No decaf coffee. The hotel is in the middle of one of the most popular places in Mexico... I don't get it. Difficult to believe in 2008 as it may seem, they don't have either coffee or cocoa. Just something called \"chocomilk\" (cold milk with very little cocoa) at breakfast. - We had some problems with the internet cards (you pre-pay 10$ for an hour). The day we tried to use it for the second time, it read we had no credit left. Impossible we had run out of credit: internet didn't work the night before. Weird-funny-pathetic to hear the guy at the front desk telling us that \"being a particular case, they would charge us for that card\". - We had water on the floor of our bathroom nearly everyday. It seems a pipe leaked a little. After the kind of service we found, we didn't bother to call anyone. - THE anecdote: One night we had to go to bed really early. At 1.30 am our neighbours were being VERY noisy and we called to front desk, so they could tell our neighbours to keep it down. At front desk the wrote down our room number.... the security guy came minutes later and told us to keep it quiet!!!! We had to tell him he got it wrong. We won't come back to this all inc. Note: Public areas look much nicer in pictures. That's why we show our room, because that's what you mainly pay for. We think it tries to look like an elegant resort but if fails miserably when looked from a shorter distance.

My wife and I, our 14 year old daughter, 18 year old son and 7 other 17 and 18 year olds. It was a high school graduation trip for our son and his friends. Our trip started in Los Angeles via Charlotte,NC then down to Cancun via US Airways. A long trip but one that was truly appreciated by all when we finally got to the Reef. I used a shuttle van company called Cancun Express which met us at the Airport and transported us down to the Reef. For a group of 11 we had our own van which only cost us $140 for round tirp transportation. I called ahead of time to get 4 rooms together in the same bldg. for the 8 teenagers, and that worked out great as they had the 1st floor to themselves in Bldg. #7. My wife and I along with our daughter were in a 1st floor bldg. #8 next door. Bldg. #9 is right next to the pool and the restaurants, so being in Bldg. #8 and #7 were great since we were close enough to the pool and restaurants, but not close that any noise would bother us. We ate at the buffet restaurant for morning, lunch and dinner most of the time, and found that the quality of the food and the choices were very good. Everyone in our group really enjoyed the food served at the buffets. The teenage kids also ate a lot at the snack bars, where they enjoyed the cheeseburgers, fries, ribs, and pizzas. They commented on how good the fries were. You could also get them covered with melted cheese. My wife and I really enjoyed the rotisserie chicken that they served there. Just as good a El Pollo Loco here in the states. We also made reservations on 3 separate evening for the Italian and Mexican restaurants that are located upstairs of the buffet restaurant. Once at the Mexican and twice at the Italian restaurants. At the Mexican restaurant I had the beef and shrimp skewers that were okay but not anything special. A few in the group ordered the fajitas, and they said they were excellent. Now the Italian restaurant was were I enjoyed my best meal. On both occasions I ordered the filet of beef covered in some type of delicious sauce, that was absolutely delicious. Others ordered the health conscious salmon fillet, and they really enjoyed it. To make reservations to either of these restaurants, you have to be at the front desk at 9:00am sharp to make reservations. The trick to this is to get there at 8:30am, get a number that they pass out, then sit around or come back at 8:55am and wait until they call your number. Seating is limited and it seems that they only make available only a portion of the restaurant seating for the guests that buy the all inclusive package. I'm thinking that the remaining seats are possibly for timeshare owners. Even with a group of 11 we were able to get reservations at a prime time 7:30 pm on 2 of the 3 nights that we ate in these restaurants. The 1st night that we ate, we could only get a 9:00 reservation, since I didn't get to the reservation desk until 8:50am of that morning, and by that time, the number I was given was 14. Outside of all of the eating that we did, most of our time was spent at the activities pool which is the pool closest to the beach. The activities desk is right next to this pool, and is the spot where you get your pool/beach towels. You sign out for the towels against your room number, and are suppose to return the towels by 5:00pm each day, when the activities desk closes. After 5:00pm you can return the towels to the front desk. We chose to keep our towels in our room each evening with us, then we traded them in for new towels each day thereafter. At the end of our time, we then returned them to the front desk. I've read that there is a $35 US fee if towels are returned. One of the great things about the pools at the Reef is that they are opened until 11:00pm each evening, so you can relax in the pool even after dinner. The snack bar which is close by stays open until 1:30am. A great place to go late in the evenings if your still hungry after the buffet restaurants closes at 9:00pm. Each evening except for Friday evenings the Reef has some type of entertainment show in the upstairs theatre above the front lobby. One night we took our daughter to see the Disney show to see the activities staff dressed up like various Disney characters and perform Disney Movie skits to music. Great to go to if you have little kits. One night they had a 60s and 70s music show where the activities staff did skits based on 60s and 70s music. We went into the town of Playa Del Carmen a couple of times to do some shopping as well as to see the sights. Lots of souvenir shops to choose from, We also rented a van from Hertz, and drove down to Tulum one afternoon to visit the ruins. Make sure that you take bug repellant there, as there are some areas of the ruins where you will get attacked by mosquitos. Also, 1 day we drove down to Yal-Ku lagoon next to Akumal beach to do some snorkeling. Probably not as good as snorkeling in Xel-Ha, but definitely cheaper as the cost to get in is only $9 US dollars per person. You can rent snorkeling eqpt for $10 US. All in all this was a fabulous trip for all of us, nobody wanted to go back home, and were dissapointed when we had to. By the way the whole staff, from the people in the lobby, the people in the restaurant, and the activities staff were excellent. Never experienced a single problem with any of them. The rooms were pleasant and we encountered no problems. Though I had read previously that the beds were hard, I felt that they were quite comfortable. I should mention that though tipping is not required. I made it a habit to tip $1 to $2 dollars fairly frequently to the buffet restaurant, snack bar, and bar staff. At the reservation restaurants since we were a large group I tipped $20 each time. I know from their expressions that they truly appreciated the tips.", "Date": "July 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cLoved The Reef\u201d", "Author": "leon4", "ReviewID": "UR17575019", "Content": "My daughter and I stayed at The Reef June 30th thru July 4th.

There were 4 adults on this trip. On arrival to the Reef, we were greeted pleasantly, assisted with our bags with smiling faces. The hotel staff were very helpfull! We check in, I was handed a cold beer and my wife received a cool margarita, which was very much appriciated after the long trip, and we were given a quick review of all the amenities on the resort(10min). Just Beautifull! This resorts sits in the middle of a jungle like atmosphere, tall palms, trees, green ivys, free flowing water fall into a large cenote. Very lush with small/cozy pathways that lead to all rooms and to pool/beach areas. Well of coarse, we were all very hungry, and the resort buffet was open(GREAT), (FOOD AVAILABLE FROM 7AM TO 2AM) The food presentation was wonderfull, plenty to pick from with a large range of food types, from Italian, American and yes even Mexican food at your request. Everything was made fresh on the grill right in front of you. The food was very tasty, and same for all the trimmings, and of coarse, they had different types of drinks(juices/milks/bottled water/soda/cold beer/wine, etc.) what ever your taste buds like, seems that they had it. The wait staff was plentifull, and heplfull. If the wait staff was very attentive, a nice tip was received, but not required. The view from the the dinning area, beautiful! Well after our meal, back to the rooms. We found our rooms very well cooled, plenty of hot water, but just an empty mimi frigd. No problem. Beds were comfortable, TV, and a nice balcony, with plenty of views to just soak it all in. We were informed of a nightly show on the grounds, we attended 1 show, which was entertaining. They have a special on Fridays, where you sign up for a quick trip to Senior Frogs in Playa De Carmen, they take you and bring you back after lots of fun and drinks! What a party, maybe 4hrs worth of fun. But if the party scene isn't your bag, thats ok too. There are plenty of lounging areas to just relax and have a cool refreshment. The BEACH, what a place to just hang out. The water was clean, warm, and just beautiful. From an aqua to a deep blue, The picture will stay with you for a long time to remember! 1 thing, there are some man made breakers(large sand bags) about 50-75ft from waters edge, but these breakers are fun to use also. You can snorkle on the deep side and swim on the shallow. The staff has an activity center, which you will need to ask for large blue towels, they will provide you with, they just need your room #, all free, plenty of places to lay your head on, nice cabanas, plenty of umbrillas with small tables, try and get a bed near the beach area (to get 1, you need to be an earlier bird, they go pretty fast, but plenty to pick from, and if your lucky, ahhh) all very close to the beach and water. You will always have multiple bars and snack bar open at your convienence. The pool areas are great, 1 has a swim up bar, the other is where all the activities are done(water polo, water vollyball, water arobics). Very clean! Things to do on the beach? Well, for this resort, they had everything right there for your picking, from a short snorkling tour(private reef), scuba, to para sailing, fishing trips in the early morning, jet ski's, paddle boats, kayaks, lots and lots of fun for your trip. If you decide to go para sailing(50-60US DOLL) or you want to go on a fishing trip, just ask for Charlie at the para sailing booth, this guy will take good care of you. I found out that all of the other resorts near by, they were sending there visitors to our beach for there entertainment. Like I said, we had all the fun stuff right at our finger tips. And if you need alitle pampering, don't miss the massage! All types, and time lengths, where you want it (room/spa/beach), very relaxing, and very reasonably priced. Downtown Playa- lots of shopping available! My wife(the wheeler and dealer) brought home plenty of silver, and misc. items. While we were there, we celebrated our anniversary, our rep. at the resort, made arraingments to eat at a resturant named AJUA in Playa. What a great place to eat, and very reasonably priced (100us doll) for 4 adults, meal/drinks and a special made cake(delicious). They had live music (SALSA), what a blast! Well, I know I have been alittle long, but I hope that you have a better insight to this 4 star resort. This resort is great for singles, couples and families. Would recommend it to anybody who wants alittle relaxation from the hard busy life. Trip was to short, can't wait to get back!

We were there 6/16/08 thru 6/20/08. We booked our vacation through JetBlue Getaways. JetBlue Getaways listed several hotels in several price ranges. I checked Trip Advisor for the hotels in our price range, and settled on The Reef. I knew I wasn't booking a 5 star resort, but I was still disppointed in the experience. Apart from the hotel, everything else about booking with JetBlue was uneventful. I was worried about the transfers to the hotel and back, but they occured like clockwork. We arrived at the hotel around 5PM. We were hungry so we went to the buffet for dinner. They offered 3 stations with a selection of meats and roasts, pastas, and authentic mexican selections. We stuck with the meats and roasts and found all of them to be disgusting. Each selection was overcooked, covered in inedible sauces, and were as tough as shoe leather. It was our first and last dinner at the hotel. After dinner we opted to check out downtown Playa. When we returned to the hotel we found that the sink in our bathroom was completly infested by thousands of tiny ants. It was off to the front desk to ask for an exterminator. To give the staff time to clear our room of ants, we decided to check out the late night snack bar. The food there was lousy as well. As we waited for our food, 5 huge cockroaches came out to visit us from behind the grill. We were starving from the lousy dinner and horrible snack bar, but the cockroaches solved our appetite problem for the evening. After our disgusting experience at the snack bar we headed back to the room to call it night. When we got back, the ant problem still had not been taken care of, and we were still facing our infestation. It was off to the front desk to switch rooms. We switched rooms for the night without any problems from the front desk. The next morning we awoke to more ants, and now a cockroach in our room. We had only been on the property a little over 12 hours, and we were ready to check out. Our complaints led to an upgraded room. Through the whole experience the staff was very understanding. The upgraded room was much nicer than the first two, but at this point the Reef experience was ruined for us. We were constantly on the look out for the remainder of our trip for bugs in our room. Apart from bugs in all the rooms we had, our only other complaint was the airconditioning. We were greatful that it worked and blew cold air, but not one thermostat worked. The rooms ended up being way too cold every night. We will definetly go back to PDC again. It is a very cool town. 5th Avenue and Playacar reminded us of Coconut Grove in Miami. We eneded up going out to dinner every night. Because of the money we spent on meals, the next time we go back to PDC we will upgrade our budget to stay at a higher rated resort. We suggest the following places for food and/or beverages in PDC. The Jaguar serves great steaks. Go to Viva Margarita for great mango margaritas and good live music. There is a cuban restaurant right near Viva Margarita. Go there for live music and great salsa dancing. Stay away from the Reef, upgrade your budget, and spend alot of time in downtown PDC. I think these are three ways to make your experience better than ours.", "Date": "June 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City", "Title": "\u201cCould not ask for more!!!\u201d", "Author": "stillhappyafter10y", "ReviewID": "UR16898753", "Content": "We stayed at the Reef from June 2-10th and had a wonderful time. I did some reading on here before we left and didnt quite know what to think about the hotel, and it was a great price so we could not pass it up how bad could it be right? Well let me tell you it was perfect. The rooms are very cold, with a mini fridge and blackout curitns, bathtub and shower, hair dryer, iron, even a makeup mirror. The beds are a little hard but not that bad and we had a down blanket it was really nice. We did pay extra for the room safe but I really dont think it was needed, but for my peace of mind... the only bad thing about the rooms are that you can hear people through the doors, but if you drink enough and get enough sun you will sleep like a baby. Next is the food. The buffet is great. I miss it. For breakfast you have all different kinds of fresh fruit, with yougret, muffins, toast, little breakfast breads, cereal, And then you move over to the hot food. There is an omlet stand that he makes them to order very good. A pancake, french toast, and creap area that is made right in front of you. My hubby ate this every day. The last area is a mexican breakfast that makes very good food that I have never had before. They take a fried flat tortilla top with beans, over easy egg, peas, ham, and red sauce with cheese it was great. A little heavy for breakfast but great.. Lunch has everything from cold cuts to chicken tacos(all tacos are soft with corn tortilla) with everythin else you could ask for always 3 or 4 different veggies cooked in different ways very interesting but great., always rice and beans, and a few different kinds of meats. Just keep an open mind and try everything and you will be suprised. Dinner is like lunch. You never know what you will get. 1 day they had a big roast iwth mash pots and gravy, other nights grilled steat, chicken, porkchops..... And always some great kind of fish. We ate fish ever night cooked different ways. One day they cooked the entire fish and served it that way it was the best. And at dinner they have a pasta area that makes it right in front of you, very cool but we never tried it. We wanted all the more mexican foods. They always had a huge selection of different foods and we never were disappointed. You can also eat at the snack bar. They have burgers(good), grilled chicked sands, coldcuts, even some bbq(we didnt try). The do have pizzas a little under cooked for us( I like mine crunchy) but still good. And the have nachos that are GREAT. We did eat dinner at both resturants, very nice fine dinning. The food was Very Good at both. The service was super. Anything that you wnat you get. Everyone goes out of thier way to help. Even the people cleaning the grounds which are beautiful. A little tip is nice to give but the service is the same with or without, they do not expect it. But we always tried to tip. The beach is beautiful. We were a little disappointed that there were no fish or anything to see with snorkling gear. But beautiful. All the beaches along our strip were the same we walked a long way down had to go over some sand bags and walk part through the water and one area we walked on a walkway but it made a very fun and interesting walk. We did it a couple fo times. All of the drinks were very good, try the miami vice was my fav. The beer was always cold, and flowing. Nothing was watered down. In the morning they have yoga(FUN), then spanish lessions, step aerobics(good workout) and then water aerobics(didnt do). And then volleyball in the water or on the beach(didnt get a chance to do to) but looked like fun. We also didnt go to any of the nightly shows. To sum it up (this ended up long sorry) Iam ready to go back. I loved the romantic jungle vibe, the small peaceful feel, the relaxing beach with umberalls it was perfect.", "Date": "June 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cGot what we expected\u201d", "Author": "KcCabinfever", "ReviewID": "UR16885257", "Content": "Our group of 4 stayed at the Reef from the 4-11th of June. Overall I think we all had a nice time. I'll break it down in categories to simplify. Room: Had no water at all upon check in. That was fixed within 10 minutes and we had no further problems with that. The water pressure isn't great, but we always had water and had no problems with water temp as some reviews mentioned. Our sink leaked a little onto the floor, but it wasn't a big deal. The beds had eggcrate mattresses and were pretty comfortable. Fridge in the room stayed cold. (No drinks were provided by the hotel, I stocked up in the gift shop and always had water and soda to drink). Air conditioning: worked very well, kept the room nice and cool. Also a ceiling fan. In room safe at an extra charge of $2 dollar a day (FYI: $100 charge if you loose the keyto the safe) Each room has it's own balcony with a small table and chairs. We had a small issue with what I think were tiny ants on the bathroom sink. But this resort is in a jungle setting, so we weren't surprised by this. Beach: We were very pleasantly surprised at how nice it was, and there were always plenty of chairs and umbrellas or palapas. There are several beds also and on they days we were there by 10:00 some were still available. The large \"sand whales\" did kind of take away from the view, but I guess it is a trade off. Pools: There are two pools. One with all the activities (a little too active and loud for me). And the swim up pool which is connected to the small kiddie pool. The pools aren't huge, but they never seemed to get really packed full of people. Food: The snack bar seemed to have the best food. Burgers, pizza, nachos,etc. Too bad they close at 6:00 and don't reopen until 10:30 pm. The buffet was average at best. On occasion I found something pretty tasty, most of the time that wasn't the case. But we always found something we could eat. The specialty restuarants (Italian and Mexican) require reservations that must be made daily between 9:00-11:00 am. So if you go on an excursion, or aren't there at that time you can't make a reservation. We only at at the Italian because the Mexican is closed on Sunday and Tues. My meal was completely inedible. Both times I went there I managed to get the same awful sauce on two different meals (? Alfredo sauce and Garlic butter sauce??- same ) I know we meet several people who were very happy with their meals, so maybe it was just that sauce. Service: Very inconsistent (and this didn't change with tipping I tipped very well infact regardless of service). Some people we came in contact with were great and very friendly. Most of the time though, we felt ignored. It was like we had to always say excuse me can you help me with....what ever we needed at the time. It was like we were bothering them. This was from the front desk to the bars to the beach towel shack to the restaurants. I don't know if it is poor training, or if certain ones are trying to make a point or if they truely just don't care. Entertainment: Not good. Only went to a few shows so I can't really speak for what they do on the nights we weren't there. One of the males from our group had an incident with Miguel from the entertainment crew. He was extremely rude at the gym one morning and wouldn't let him come in to lift weights. (He is just a big bully with big ego IMO) Overall: The location is great, nice walk to town (20 min at a leisurely pace) We have stayed at several AI and most of them from this area (Playacar). I knew before I booked here that it was a \"budget AI\" We got a pretty good deal and we got what we paid for. Our expectations weren't high.

We have stayed in another all-inclusive in PDC so we have some experience to compare it to. We refused the orientation upon arrival. After traveling all day we just wanted to start enjoying ourselves and not spend hours listening about their timeshare. We had to wait a few hours for our rooms to be ready anyway but we used that time to eat and explore the resort on our own. They put us in two rooms with double beds rather than kings. We asked to be moved and they next day they moved us all. The walls are thin and we were awoken around 2 am almost everynight by a group of loud college aged guests. This was frustrating. This resort seemed to be more of a party place than other places we have stayed. Everything in the rooms worked great. Air conditioning was very cold, water was hot, doors locked, etc... However, several days we returned to our room to find the door wide open and people working in there. Several times we had to wait for them to finish, which was frustrating because we had returned to our room to shower and meet our friends for dinner. One day they cut a hole in our bathroom wall and returned while I was in the shower insisting they look at it again. The next day they returned to patch the hole. Really it was not a big deal, just a little inconvienent. We ate at the buffet, the snack bar and at one of the reservations only restaurants. The buffet food was OK, we enjoyed that they cooked in front of us as we ordered. We wished that we had tried the other reservation restaurant as the Mexican Grill was pretty good (although very slow service- almost 2 hours). We are all a little sick now but I can't say it was definitely the hotel food. We also enjoyed that many of the bars and restaurants were open at the same time and for a variety of hours. A previous AI resort that we staryed at only one restaurant or snack bar was open at a time. We had more to choose from at the Reef. We always got chairs or a daybed near the beach or the pool. There were a lot of people in the pool with the swim up bar, very festive. We enjoyed the beach and made the most out of the bladders. We enjoyed the hotel grounds. The jungle atmosphere was fun and nice to walk around. We walked to town and all around the resort neighborhood. It is a very nice area, better than other places where we have stayed in PDC. My biggest complaint was upon checkout. Each day they put two bottles of water in your room and charge $5 if you drink one. We brought our own bottled water so we didn't drink theirs. But by the end of the week they had left four bottles of water for us anyway. Our friends checked out before we did and the hotel charged them for all of their water. They went back to their room to get the bottles to prove that they had not drank them and all of the bottles were gone. We went to our room to get our bottles before we checked out and found all of our bottles gone as well and they tried to charge us $20 for them. We refused to pay for them and they had us sign something that said we did not drink the water. The whole thing was kind of shady I thought. Overall we had a great time and will probably go back.

We really were impressed with it all the way around. It is one of the smaller resorts in the area (around 200 rooms) and that is one of the reasons we chose it. There were no long lines at the buffet or shortage of good chairs on the beach. The property is rather narrow but is very long and the buildings (12 rooms in each) are seperated by a \"jungle\" environment. The grounds were immaculate and the staff were super friendly and helpful. We stayed (6 days) in building 10 near the pool. Here is sort of my breakdown of things by subject: Rooms: Very clean with no real issues. Our air conditioning worked fine. The water temperature in the shower did fluctuate quite a bit. Beds were not hard as reported by other reviewers. No bugs in site. Beach: Someone narrow with huge \"sand bags\" to break the surf. On the days we were there it was very windy and rough. There would have been no way to swim in the ocean without them breaking the waves. We did not get to use any of the available equipment (masks, windsurfing, sailboats,etc.). I did not find the beach to be all that spectacular compared to other places that I've been to. I was disappointed that the beach is cut off by buildings with seawalls to both the north and past only one resort to the south. If you like long walks on the beach this is not the place for you. There are no shells on these beaches which makes the sand \"soft\". Staff: Everyone was great. Communication not a problem at all. I do recommend tipping them for even better service. Security was very good with staff walking the grounds and at entrance points. Pools: Could be a little larger but worked out fine for us. Daily water aerobics, pool and beach volleyball and other activities. Food: Overall the food at the buffet was pretty good. Due to the somewhat changing variety we thought one of the nights was fantastic and one fell a little flat. Our one complaint is that the full breakfast buffett wasn't open until after 7:30, which was after the time our tours had departed on 2 of the days. Returned from a tour at 8:30 and buffet selection was very limited at that time. Snack area near pool was very good. Drinks are brand name and not watered down. Entertainment: Save yourself some time and skip the nightly shows. If you are looking to be entertained, this is not the place for you. Location: We picked this resort based on its location away from Cancun and closer to the ruins of Tulum and the water park Xel-Ha. It worked out great in that regard. It is walking distance to downtown Playa del Carmen which we did twice. It is very safe and you shouldnt hesitate to do that. We borrowed the hotels bikes one morning and went through all the nearby streets. There are small ruins in a free public park located less than 3 minutes away from the resort along the sidewalk which you should go see. Overall, we really enjoyed this resort and our visit to Mexico.

This is not a luxuary 5 star resort, but it was absolutely fabulous! The grounds were beautiful, and you could tell they take great pride in their tropical setting they have created! The service and personal are extremely friendly and always did all they could to help us when we needed them. Check in was easy and no one bugged us once about time shares. We even mentioned this to one of the concierge ladies and she told us to remember that this is our vacation and to never be bothered with time share offers. When we got to the room we realized the sliding glass door to our deck wouldn't lock. We would not have cared if we were not on the ground level. When we went to call the front desk, the phone did not work. We walked back to the lobby and they had both things fixed in 10 minutes! The service was awesome. We stayed in 3 different rooms during our trip. The first time we asked to be moved after a night of no sleep due to noise. We had a room right by the bar open until 2 am (I can't remember all the names of the bars). They immediately found us another room. The next room we had was because we checked out for 2 nights to stay in Cancun (We went to stay two nights at the Crown Paradise, which was awful! We couldn't wait to get back to the Reef). When we came back to the Reef they put us in one of the \"nicer\" rooms. It felt like they put a matress pad on the bed and updated the linens, which gave the room that little extra something the other rooms were missing. The AC and hot water worked great in all 3 rooms! The only thing someone might have an issue with is the size of the two pools, they are on the small size. But we didn't care since we loved the ocean there and would swim in the ocean. The buffet food was delicious and satisfying, especially breakfast time. And the little snack bar was good, except at times it seemed understaffed and there would be a huge crowd waiting for food, but they usually got all the orders filled in a short time. We hired a professional photographer for a photo session, and The Reef was very accomodating! They even cut off our wristbands for us so they wouldn't stand ou t in the pics and gave us new ones after the session. I was impressed/grateful for that.

I was hoping for the best and, for the most part, I was indeed lucky. The entryway is very nice and the staff quite helpful. A Rain Forest type theme is prevalent throughout. As most others stated, the rooms are modest and very clean. No bugs and the showers had both hot water and strong pressure each time throughout our 5 day trip. The maids kept things very clean and were quite cordial. The beach is one of the larger and nicest beaches of the resorts here. We walked along the beach and none of the other places had a nicer one. The Reef's was not only a littler bigger but it had mroe umbrellas and tiki type huts than the others. The bars and food are right next to the beach and pools so everything is very convenient. In fact from one end of the property to the next takes literally 30 seconds so it's very quaint. The drinks were definitely not the best and the food wasn't anything great either. We only tried the buffett and the Italian restaurant at night. You'll be hard pressed to find anything decent on site during this time of day. I was skeptical of other reviews saying the same but it's definitely true. Just very little flavor for anything but side dishes at this time. The biggest disappointment of the trip. Recommendations-If you want something luxurious this is not the place. If you want something more \"authentic\" and smaller in scale try this. The breakfasts are great. The lunch is so so and the dinners are horrible. Try the snack bar for pizza, hamburgers, nachos ,etc if the dinners prove the same to you and you're still hungry-it's open almost all times of day, well into the night. I'd suggest going to town at night for dinner. The downtown area is only a 10 minute walk away and has tons of shopping and dining options available. A cab ride costs $5. Even the fancier restaurants have reasonalbe prices and the food was great at all of them that we tried. Don't miss the ice cream parlor each afternoon. It's some of the best ice cream I've had.

I traveled with my spouse and 3 yr old. I read reviews before booking this trip so I knew what to expect. The jungle setting of the resort was very nice and a refreshing change from those large gltizy resorts. I loved the size of this place. It was so convenient to get to everything - food, pool, lobby, etc. Nothing was more than a 2-5 minute walk. The pools were great - nice kiddie pool. The beach was awesome - no rocks and soft sand. This place had lots of beach chairs, canopy beds and shade. The food was average. I preferred the buffet because it was quick and the variety was good. We tried both restaurants - didn't care too much for the Italian but the Mexican Rest. was fine. The snack bar was good - lots to eat for our toddler there. Ice cream was good and drinks were always plenty. Service was fantastic. The staff was friendly and helpful. They always smiled and said Hola to us and we responded with the same. We did tip $1-2 dollars for really good service. We had double beds and the room was kept clean. A/C worked fine and the hot water was plenty. A couple of times the water pressure was low but my spouse likes to use lots of hot water. Surprisingly, there were no bugs. None were found in our room and nobody got bug bites. Stay away from the timeshares. The lobby staff will try to get you to go for this by telling you it only takes 80 mins (it's really 3 hrs). We met some people that told us about their experience. Only go if you are truly interested in learning more. We took a ferry to Cozumel. This 30 min trip only cost $22 round trip. More jewelry selection over there. You can walk 20 mins to the ferry from the resort or take a $5 cab ride. I found the vendors in Cozumel more willing to bargain with you. The nightly entertainment could use some improvement. A couple of dancers kept messing up the steps and it was funny to see. But a few of them were very good. Prepare to go and laugh and have a good time. It's not broadway. The drinks are the best at the show bar. My favs were - Tequila Sunrise and the Riviera Maya. Overall, we had a fabulous time. Keep in mind that this is a family friendly resort. It was very relaxing and clean. Met lots of nice people - about 75% Americans.

The grounds and location are the best on Playa, the beach is huge, and the staff is very hard working and friendly. The food was average at the Buffet but had a very large fruit selection. They even make you fresh fruit smoothies. There was always something to eat. The breakfast was usually the best with made to order omlettes, french toast, pancakes. The dinners were average, but may not meet the needs of a picky eater. (I found it hard to find good meat, the other side dishes were wonderful). The snack bar with pizza, hamburgers, and other more casual food was decent as well. The Quesadillas at the snack bar are the best thing there, I believe. There were several small annoying issues with the Reef, but as long as you are aware that this is NOT a luxury resort then I believe they are easily overlooked. Upon checking into the hotel, we were told that the air conditioning was broken in two buildings 17 and 18. (Not quite sure how this could be, as each room had its own unit..but whatever). They told us that we would have to spend our first night in a five star hotel in Cancun. (After the hour long shuttle ride down here this was NOT an acceptable option) We demanded a room they found us one. I believe that a key to your success at the Reef is the location. If you get a room that is on the ground floor, outside of the maid closet...MOVE. Otherwise they will be in and out of the closet at all hours of the night. Also, if you get a room facing the giant resort next door MOVE.. the alley is very loud and will again keep you up all night. The rooms at the Reef are clean and modest, but noise was definitely an issue throughout our stay. The bed in the room was very hard, and on several occasions we did not have hot water. The repairman was very quick to fix the problem on both days, so if this happens call the front desk. I still, after these issues, would recommend the Reef to travelers on a budget looking for the grounds and the beach of a luxury resort. I knew what to expect when we got to the Reef, so I was not surprised about the hard beds, noise and lack of hot water on several days.

The other being in Punta Cana, DR. And as the title says, this was a fabulous establishment for the price we paid. After reading various reviews, I did have some concerns which I will address. Air conditioning - was not a problem in our room. Cold showers - sometimes the water will start off cold, but after running for a few minutes it heated up and we never had to take a cold shower. Soapy drinks - brought our own thermal mugs, but the few times we did use resort plastic cups this was not an issue. Food - good selection and quality, but be warned that fruit flies are in abundance where the fruit is. Italian restaurant - agree that service is slow, but they are severely understaffed. Quality was no better than the buffet. Timeshares - we were not approached at all at the hotel. However, when you exit the airport you will be approached. A simple firm \"No thank you\" and you are on your way. The resort itself is very well maintained and quaint. The tropical theme is simply gorgeous. Even the furthest room from the beach is only a 5 minute walk if that. The beach at this resort is very nice. The \"bags\" that were intentionally placed do break the waves and are somewhat of an eyesore, but my girlfriend and I had fun trying to scale them one day. We did not try snorkeling or any other activities at the hotel. We did visit Tulum. Simply amazing from both a historical aspect as well as the beach. We elected to take a \"colectivo\" there which cost us $3 a person each way. Entrance to Tulum was $5 each. The beach there is amazing and you could probably make a day out of it. However, you would have to walk back to the main entrance to get lunch as you cannot eat at the site. The walk from where the colectivo drops you off to the site is less than a mile. After a couple hours at Tulum, we went to Xel-Ha. This was somewhat of a disappointment for the entrance fee of $75, but I could see how it would be nice for families. One of our other days, we took a ferry to Cozumel which costs $24 round trip. When there we rented a scooter and snorkel equipment for a total cost of $45. We toured the entire coast stopping at various beaches along the way for snorkeling and food. We had an awesome time. Refilling the tank cost an additional $5 prior to returning the scooter. This is a must do for young couples. 5th avenue is within walking distance and has various shops. However, this avenue is commercialized and no different from any other tropical shopping strip.

It was my first vacation to a tropical place, and it was well worth it. Playacar was beautiful, the beach was blissful, the weather was perect, and our stay at this resort was wonderful. It is a small resort. only about 250 rooms...however it was nice because all the guests were so friendly and we met alot of people. There was a mixture of guests...lots of families but also a good amount of couples. The room was clean, the ac was ice cold, we had a deck area with chairs, the bathroom was nice, the room was cleaned well each day (we left a 2 dpllar tip each day on the pillow) there were no bugs anywhere! We were about half way between the lobby and the pool area. It was so quiet each night. we went to bed around 11 and woke up early. but never had a probelm with late nighters. I went with my boyfriend and we were looking for a nice place with a good beach and a close walk to the down town of playa del carmen 5th avenue. Since the resort was small...if you are looking for a place with a bunch of restaurants and pools then this is not for you. They have 2 pools. the main one has a swim up bar and the one closer to the ocean has activities going on all the time. vollyall, bingo, aerobics, yoga, spanish lessons, etc. The staff was so helpful and most speak english. the mexicans are so friendly they say hola to anyone that walks by them and greats you with a pleasant smile. It is nice to know a few spanish phrases though, that way they will understand you a little better. Especially food phrases!!! My boyfriend is Puerto Rican so he was able to communicate. The snack bar was great...you could get sandwiches, pizza, burgers, fries, quesadillas, ice cream, etc pretty much anytime you want. There were about 4 bars...all very friendly. The buffet was great...you could get fruit and salad anytime. There was a station for pasta, one for meats (steaks, fish, chicken) and obvisously a mexican station. I only ate for breakast (which was delicious. i really liked the french toast) and dinner. there is always fresh bread as well. We went to the al a carte italian restaurant one night which was O.K not as good as the buffet...but i think it depends what you order. I got chicken parm and it is totally different from the dish in the USA. I heard there mexican restaurant was great to (but i did not eat there.) The spa was nice. i got a massage, however it is way more expensive than if you walk down the streat to the downtown. for a 50 min massage it was $70 but if you go downtown it was only $30. It is about a 15 minute (beautiful walk) or a 5 dollar taxi ride to 5th avenue. There are clubs and bars everywhere. At the resort there is an activities area where you can book, snorkling, diving, jet skis, parasailing, etc. at a resonable price. We went on a tour through TNT vacations where we went snorkling to 3 different sites, a laguna, a river like area, and the cenote;s (a cave) that tour was so much fun and lasted all day. The beach at the resort is one of the best we saw. We walked about 30 minutes up the beach and looked for shells which was fun! The water is so blue and clear, and not any shaks, or jellyfish. It was so much fun..i would def. reccommend this resort!. Also...the bottled water is $1 but the evion is $5 so make sure you dont open the evion :)...i brushed my teeth with bottled water but i drank the water at the buffet and bars because they use the bottled water (purified) . You can also get your water bottles filled for free anytime. the ice cubes are fine too and the fruit and veg. are good to eat. No one got sick that we know at the resort. (i was worried because of horror stories i heard about people going to playa del carmen and getting sick from the water at the resorts) but...the Reef was purified and it was a relief to kno!

We would probably never go back to this resort.... The first day we got in, the air didnt work in our friends room, then the switched rooms which was great. But two days later they never updated the room change and when we got back to the beach guests where in her room, looking around. Then our other friends room flooded and they really didnt do anything about it but cleaned up the water and the air conditioner leaked the whole time, so they were constantly cleaning the water up. Our expirence was not great either, we only had warm water 2 days out of 8, which is ok when you are coming up from being at the beach all day but when you wake up in the morning it sucks. Also, It would take them about 1-2 hours to fix the problems with the water too. The maid did not clean our room for two days which is not a big deal but come to find out they had us checked in to a totally different room. NICE! Then we made reservations for the mexican restaurant and we get ready and go for our 7:30 reservation and the restaurant is closed and nobody told us. They did try and make it better by giving us reservation for the next day so that was fine. Then on the 4th day of our stay our air compressor went out and we slept for 2 nights in a very hot room until they moved us to a suite. Very nice suite but once again no hot water and it sucked sleeping in a hot room for 2 nights. The food was boring, bland and always the same. No varity! The best was the snack bar and The mexican restaurant was great.... the soup was fantastic. The italian restaurant was blah, not bad or good. the other thing that would have been great is if they had chips and salsa to snack on it was wierd because all they really had at the snack bar was american food.

It was great. We did do some investigating before so we knew it was not a 5 star place but we were okay with that. We were very happy here, the rooms were clean and fine, we loved to sit out on our terrace in the evenings, the maid service was very good also. We came down with a large group of 8 families with lots and lots of kids. I do not recall being asked about the timeshare thing even ONCE while there, although we were warned about that before so someone in our group might have squelched it right off the bat.

Yes - you did have to get up early to get a seat but it has been that way everywhere we've ever traveled to. The food was okay, not the greatest. They didn't have guacamole which was disappointing for us.

The staff was nice but one bartender was a little crabby when we were in the pool bar one night with our large group and I was getting everyone's drinks, he wasn't the nicest.

It's pretty easy to keep track of your kids around here too, you can get a good look of the whole place from the upper pool deck. Our kids had a ball. The sand-bag things in the ocean on playa are kind of a bummer.

FYI: they do not take no for an answer very well. my husband had to say it 5 or 6 times before they let us leave. quite annoying. when we arrived in our room, we were greeted with a \"honeymoon package\", including two Just Married t-shirts, some champagne, and a nice decoration of flower petals on our bed. very nice, we thought! the room could have used little upgrades here and there (i.e. a little rust on the bathroom faucet, a little stain on the window shade, a few stains on the rugs on either side of bed), but the room was fine overall. no problem with the air conditioning at all. the shower was not always reliable as far as giving you consistent hot water, and you virtually had no water pressure. didn't seem to be a big issue to us though. the doors to the rooms could have been a little more sound-proofed, as you could really hear anything going on in the corridors at all times....a little annoying. the beds are HARD, so be prepared! surprisingly we slept well though, probably wiped out from the sun and alcohol all day! the grounds are absolutely beautiful at the reef! there were always staff members cleaning up the sidewalks and watering the beautiful trees and plants all day long. and everyone always gave you a nice smile and \"hola\"! the ice cream parlor is wonderful! the ice cream is great, and you sit there eating it feeling like you're in a rainforest! there are cenotes (underground caves leading to rivers) all over the place, which are untouched and beautiful to look at! it's just a very lovely place to walk around and enjoy. the pools are wonderful, and the beach is one of the best you'll find. the upper pool has the swim up bar and scuba diving lessons. the bar never seemed crowded, besides the occasional group of people that would congregate at times. the scuba groups never seemed to interfere with the swimming, and the instructors will strike up a conversation with you if you happen to be sitting in the pool close to them. this pool also had the shallow end for the little kids to play, which was also nice for the adults to sit in. the other really nice feature of this pool is that is has a ledge all the way around to sit on, and on one end it has a good size section that you can sit on also. very nice for cooling off without having to get all the way in. the lower pool was the more active pool, with volleyball, boogie board races and water aerobics, but again never to busy to quick take a dip and cool off. the food was ok. very typical mexican food, more so than american-mexican food. the snack bar offered the typical american fare of hamburgers, hot dogs and french fries. most of the time it was pretty good. the drinks were always plentiful, keeping in mind that they only offer draft beer of corona, and the mixed drinks varied between pretty weak alcohol content or way too much alcohol! the bartenders were always friendly, and even better if you slipped them a tip or two! the service in the buffet was good most of the time. there was one instance when i had to get my own cup of coffee, as our waitress didn't even make eye contact with us for a good 5-6 minutes after we sat down. not too big of a deal though. we never did eat or even attempt to make reservations for the restaurants upstairs, so i don't have an opinion on those. the entertainment was pretty bad most of the time. we really looked forward to some good entertainment, but we were disappointed more times than not. on fridays, the resort loads up their bus with people that want to go to senor frogs in downtown playa, but it costs $35 per person (for an open bar at the restaurant) and you can't leave until everyone else is ready (unless you take a taxi home earlier). so unless you feel like you can drink $35 worth of drinks, it's not worth it, and then there is no entertainment at the resort that night. overall, the resort is nice, keeping in mind that it is one of the first and smallest resorts on the strip. and if you know going into it that it is not a plush, fancy 5 star resort, then you really will enjoy it. would we go back? probably not, especially since it seems to be selling out to the timeshare sharks as we speak. but we would be more likely to spend a little more money next time and upgrade to a higher rated resort.", "Date": "April 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cGlad I went to Mexico but wished I booked a different resort\u201d", "Author": "needingholidays", "ReviewID": "UR14662549", "Content": "After reading the reviews I was worried but I thought the trip would be what you make it and to stay positive...well the time share people are brutal if you get stuck with them.

Because I refused to talk to them and after being chewed out by the manager for not talking to them, they wouldn't take our bags to our room so we had to wonder around in the dark after travelling for 7 hours looking for our room, then after figuring out how the Villas work we had to drag our suitcases up 4 flights of stairs. Upon entering our room I was glad to find a clean and ok looking room however our air conditioner was dripping all over the floor and was making very loud banging noises. We then went to the buffet since we were starving, again in the dark having to find everything on your own is not easy. The service was indeed bad in the buffet because of so few staff. The good news was the next morning when I went to the pool and the beach - very nice indeed. The food remained terrible at the buffet so we switched to the a la carte at night, the food wasn't great but the service at least got better there. We tried the snack bar at lunch but it was crazy and not very many places to sit once you managed to get your burger and cold fries. The ice cream parlour that opened at 3pm was good. The front lobby bar the opened late afternoon was good. The time share people called us again in our room and tricked us to come to the lobby because \"something of ours was there\" and then sales pitching my husband AGAIN. It truly was upsetting. We are early to bed early to rise people, didn't work so well at this resort. The rooms are very loud and the doors sound like they are slamming and shoes slapping because of the marble floors echoing in the villas. So at night mainly 4am after the bars downtown closed our Villa was \u201calive\u201d with slamming and slapping which meant I was up at 4 am every day - A little too early even for this early riser. When I went to the pool early in the morning to grab a seat (you need to do this by 7am or all the best seats are gone) I found the lovely group of young Mexican boys who had a time share across the street using the pool area as their bedroom \u2013 about 10 of them. Each day they would drink themselves silly at the bar, sleep at the pool and beach overnight, wake up and walk directly into the buffet without so much as washing their hands or looking in a mirror. First time was somewhat amusing, second and third\u2026not so much. Security didn\u2019t seem to mind so I guess anything goes at this hotel. Warnings \u2013 if it rains there is no place to go. None of the bars during the day offer shelter. They also state there are rainy day activities, but when I went to the suggested area there was nothing and no-one. The upstairs bar over the lobby has shelter but isn\u2019t open until night and the wooden and tiled pathways leading everywhere throughout the resort become a slippery safety hazard not too mention trying to walk up 4 fights of wet stairs to your room. Example \u2013 man from Germany fell the first night going up the stairs to his room and broke 3 ribs!! There are too many stairs at the resort, if you have any and I mean any trouble with stairs this resort is NOT for you. Bottled water can get very pricey, suggest going into town for supplies and you will want water as it can go up to 40 during the day. No bottle beer available so it usually comes luke warm when ordered. The wine is not good but the other drinks are fine if you can get service. The pool/swim up bar has the best service out of the three water bars (lunch buffet, swim up bar and beach bar) except that everything happens in that pool, the bar, the kids pool and the scuba lessons. I was grossed out thinking of all that in one place, especially when no one ever left their spot \u2013 I guess people do not use the washroom when on vacation if you get my meaning??? Nothing starts on time, ever, including lunch. The shows at night are terrible, the worst we have ever encountered, except the Mr. Reef night and that was due to the fact we watched our own up there instead of the \u201centertainers\u201d. The performers usually smoked and drank themselves silly before the show\u2026 so you can only imagine what the performance was like and then we had to see them the next morning, hung over and giving us our towels - that actually was slightly amusing. In the end we loved Mexico, went on a fabulous trip to Coba, loved going into Playa Del Carmen and the beach and pool were very nice. However I would never go back to the Reef or recommend it to anyone. It looks like that might not even be a problem now, the time share people told us that the hotel was not renewing it\u2019s licence and will be switching to just time shares. Good for them.

However the best part of staying at the Reef Playacar was leaving the 'Hotel Hole in the Wall'. What a dump. Here is a list of what I had to live for one week: 1. Cold showers - at least 4 times 2. No water - at least 2 times 3. Soap in drinks too many times 4. Nice warm beer all the time 5. Cockroaches in the bathroom 6. Thin door to next unit - no privacy 7.

The reviews on Tripadvisor played a large part in convincing me that this particular place was a good bet. I was not disappointed. First of all, don\u2019t expect a five star hotel if you didn\u2019t pay for one. If it is really important for you to have a luxurious room, the the Reef is not for you. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s not a dive, but the rooms are a bit on the small side and the beds - well, let\u2019s just say that they\u2019re a bit softer than the tile floor. Personally, the room is only important as a place to sleep and to keep my stuff while I am out enjoying myself. I don\u2019t go on vacation to sit in a hotel room. One bit of advice - upon arrival, you will be asked to make an appointment to hear about the \u201cVacation Club\u201d. Basically, this is a sales pitch. It will wipe out an entire day of your holiday. I politely but firmly told them I was not interested in giving up one minute of my vacation to listen to a sales pitch. Been there done that and got the lousy t-shirt. I was not bothered again. The Concierge also tried to lure us in with offers of \u201cdeals\u201d on side trips to Xel-Ha and Xcaret. Trust me, you can do it for less than what they are offering. Book Xel-Ha online for $68/ adult and take a collectivo van from Playa for a mere 30 pesos per person. The Reef Playacar is unique in that it is small and located at the end of a long strip of hotels. There is less traffic on the beach out front as a result. The beach is also much nicer than at many other resorts - more sand and better surf conditions for kids to play in. A lot of other hotels are working hard to bring their beaches up to what the Reef is like. The staff is plentiful, helpful, cheerful and polite. It seemed as though there was a much higher staff to guest ratio than at other places I have stayed. The lush rain-forest like setting is meticulously maintained and really beautiful. This place is extremely tidy and clean. The buffet restaurant offered a good selection of food. Generally, the food was of better quality than a five star I visited twice in Puerto Vallarta. The two a la carte restaurants were nice, although I did not find that the food was really any better than what the buffet had to offer. Expect to get your own poolside drinks at this resort. There are some outdoor servers, but most people get their own drinks and since it is never far to go, it\u2019s not really an issue. One annoyance I experienced was that I had to go to the front desk every day to get them to re-program our room keys as they would stop working. On our last night at the Reef I was taking a shower and experienced a mild electric shock when I touched the metal faucet. Same with the bathroom sink faucet. I notified the front desk and it was dealt with and repaired immediately by the maintenance staff. There are pool activities going on all day - yoga, aerobics, volleyball and other less conventional games. It was a lot more lively pool scene than I had experienced at the other resort we have been staying at. If you prefer a quieter atmosphere, you can just step down to the beach area where there are plenty of additional chairs and umbrellas. Incidentally, there are no beach hustlers selling hats, t-shirts etc., which is nice. Speaking with other guests, I found quite a few who were repeat visitors and many who said they liked the small intimate atmosphere and would return. I would definately consider returning to the Reef Playacar in the future.", "Date": "March 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "MN", "Title": "\u201cBeen there twice, was good, but will try another all-inclusive\u201d", "Author": "SunseekerfromMpls", "ReviewID": "UR14392508", "Content": "My husband and I went to the Reef Playacar mid to late February 2008 and had a great time. This was actually our 2nd time visiting this resort. We had been there in November 2003 for a wedding and it was awesome (pre-hurricanes). Look out for the time-share people, I mean the \"vacation club\" people. I had read about these on Trip Advisor prior to leaving and they were all correct. We checked in after a very long delay and immediately was swept over to the concierge desk so they could tell us about the hotel. I thought they would talk about the restaurants, the bars, when everything opened, etc. No, they proceeded to scam us for $20 US a piece to listen to a 90 min. vacation club talk. We refused and the concierge person was visibly upset with us. Our names went into a 'black binder' and we got up and left feeling akward. We were taken to our room which the AC was broken and was dripping all over the floor. We were placed in 3 different rooms before we finally had one that worked and was a King size bed. We talked to several other vacationers and they had the same issues--broken AC. The funny thing about this hotel is that they actually have a card hanging on the back of your door that is a checklist of \"things that need to be repaired\" like: toilet, faucet, shower, AC, T.V., etc. which is sort of unsettling. The pool bar is amazing and I loved the bartenders - Feliciano you are the best! The grill guys are also very nice and the food at the grill was way better than the buffett food. We knew the food wasn't always the best, but the restaurants I thought were a vast improvement and would recommend both the Italian and Mexican for eating at night (make sure you make reservations the day of at 9 a.m. near the front desk). Avoid the buffett if you can. Breakfast was alright. Staff seemed annoyed and under-staffed. Asking for a diet coke was like asking them to move mountains. I felt bad for most of the staff as they were working in multiple areas from early a.m. to late at night. Avoid the buffett for lunch as many meats sit out in the heat. The beach is probably still the best in Playa del Carmen at this point. Unfortunately, it was windy every single day we were there so we opted to hang out in the pool bar, which was the best! We ventured out to the ocean twice and the first time I was actually hit by a jellyfish and didn't even know it. Others at our resort had the same mysterious wounds on their stomach, thigh, arms and neck. One of the scuba divers told us it was probably a jelly fish, however none of us ever felt a sting?! So, 5 weeks later I'm still trying to get rid of the ugly bite. We met some fantastic people and liked the variety of bars, closeness to downtown and the pool bar. We had a great time, however we know that we will probably venture out somewhere new next time. Overall, the value was priced about right. Also, look out for the different colored bracelets people are wearing. We had heard that people paid more money, like $100 per bracelet to get top shelf liquor. It really didn't matter b/c we didn't have the fancy wrist band and still managed to get whatever we wanted to drink.", "Date": "March 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cWould NEVER go back!\u201d", "Author": "NF32008", "ReviewID": "UR14345326", "Content": "Please keep in mind I was in no way expecting a 5 star hotel...My boyfriend and I stayed at the Reef for 5 nights in early March.

However, we checked in around on Thursday evening, and although we requested a king bed, we were stuck with 2 doubles for the whole trip. Apparently, you are supposed to receive some kind of \"welcome package\" upon check-in where someone tells you where everything is, the times everything is available, about the restaurants, where to get beach towels, etc...We never got it. So, when we went to make reservations at one of the al a carte restaurants, we were told we should have made those upon arrival and they were all booked for the remainder of our trip. This proved to be very inconvenient considering I got FOOD POISONING from the dinner buffet, which we never ate at again. We ended up walking into town every night and eating better and more authentic (and apparently cleaner) food. The breakfast buffet is probably your safest bet. Aside from the food, the hot water was turned off 3 times during our 5 day trip. I'm not just talking for a few minutes at at time, the ENTIRE day. We were forced to take cold showers...which usually are reserved for maniacs. They sent around a letter once warning the guests it would be off...but the other 2 times, we called down to see how long and they would just mumble something that made no sense to get us off the phone.

This place is everything it promises to be. Its small compared to the Riu Palace next door. Only 18 - 3 story buildings housing a few rooms. These are nestled into a immaculate jungle setting and make walking to and from the beach a nice stroll. When we arrived our room was ready but there was a maintenance guy replacing the thermostat. He was gone in a few minutes. We walked down to the beach around 3pm to see the most gorgeous water and beach. Color of the water undescribable, breathtaking. There is a nice size beach and much deeper then the other two resorts to the west. To the east is a private house built right to the water making it impossible to walk that direct very far. There is no real problem getting the chairs you want if you get down there by 8 am. Breakfast starts at 6:30 so it worked great for us. You can get a tan at 8AM and its better then mid day actually when it can be a little intense.

Our room was immaculate and the maid cleaned it very well every day. We left her a $2 tip every day. There is no evening turndown service. The air conditioning worked great (we could make our room quite cold if we wanted to). The bed was firm, but very comfortable.

It was quite adequate for our group\u2019s needs. Every morning at breakfast there is a nice spread of fruits, cheeses, cold cuts, and cereal. There was also an omelet station, a pancake/French toast station, and a station making Mexican breakfasts. They would also cook eggs to order. In the evening the buffet had a wide variety of food. Steak was good. It also had other selections (chicken, fish, etc\u2026) as well as a pasta bar at least one night. There was also Mexican food every night.

We waited almost an hour for the car and, although we had read that it was a 45 minute drive, we actually had to drop off other people so it took almost 1 1/2 hours to get to our resort. None of this was the fault of the hotel but we were expecting the worst when we arrived! We had read many poor reviews about the Reef but since it was a quick 3 night trip, we wanted to save money and chose this resort. When we arrived, the people were great. Very friendly and, due to our short stay, we were upgraded (along with our friends) to the ocean view time-share suites. Only two buildings on the property actually face the ocean and the view is really only good from the top floors...which is only 4 rooms. We got two of those rooms and were thrilled! Housekeeping was perfect, the bed was perfectly firm and the temperature was ideal. The water pressure in both of our showers was VERY poor but we didn't really care. We still got clean! Another perk (we still don't know how we got it) was that we got black wristbands which made us VIP's. That meant they actually UNLOCKED a special cabinet with their premium alcohol...Crown Royal, Bailey's, etc. The alcohol choices still were poor...no Southern, Captain Morgan's or any beer other than Dos Equis. I really never had a good drink the entire time I was there (but I'm picky). Pool-side Pina Coladas were fun but so filling and even when you added your own alcohol, it was very weak.

Nicely deccorated but not fancy. Not sure if it was from the AC or water, a couple days we had a noise coming from somewhere. At first it was annoying but it didn't bother me after a while. We didn't bother having anyone come to try and fix it because we weren't in the room all that much. We always had hot water however sometimes with water would just die out, then after a few seconds it would come back on. Didn't find this to be a big deal as the water always came back on within a few seconds. There were a few small ants in the bathroom however keet in mind this the hotel is set within a lush jungle setting so there will probably be some ants. Again, not much of a problem for me. Our room had a balcony with a table and chairs and a nice view of the jungle vegetation. Very pretty view. In all I found the rooms not frilly or fancy but it more than met my needs and was charming.

The unique grounds was one of the main reasons I chose this hotel; I loved walking around the hotel and checking out all the beautiful plants. Big plus! There is a nice sitting area in the center of the grounds that is surrounded by plants. Very lovely and relaxing place to hang out. Pool was clean and well kept, although it was a bit chilly. No hot tub which I would have liked at night. Nice swim up bar, fun! I didn't have a problem finding a good chair. There was another pool for activities that I did not go in but also looked nice. Food, Drink: There are multiple bars. My favorites were the lobby bar and the pool bar of course. It was a bit confusing to find the right one that was open at night though. The lobby bar was always open at night but was a bit of a walk from our room. I wish there would have been somewhere open 24hrs. to get a drink. Roomservice would have also been awesome however I understand that this is not offered in order to keep the cost down. Bring an insulated mug to get your drinks in as they will melt fast here! Mixed drinks were average, nothing fantastic but it was sure nice just to have someone make me my drinks whenever I wanted (except after 2AM). If you ask for your drink a certain way the bartenders will do their best to give you what you want. There is a brakfast, luch, and dinner buffet. The buffet room is not airconditioned. Would have liked some airconditioning because it can get a little steamy in there...not too big of a deal though as there are many fans. The breakfast buffet was good and offered made to order omlets, which is pretty much the only thing I ate for breakfast. You put all the stuff you want in it on a plate and hand it to the chef who whips you up a yummy omlet. Other typical breakfast stuff was served like french toast and pancakes but these items were not made in front of you. Lunch buffet was the best and offered the most variety and served things like grilled chicken, beef, pasta with choice of sauce, pork, rice, beans, fruit, variety of breads, some Mexican foods. Did not care for the dinner buffet. It offered the least variety and the food was never replenished. I suggest making reservations at one of the specialty restaurants instead. Buffet food always runs the chance of getting a bit monotonous and being bland but I fared pretty well. I pretty much stuck to the grilled chicken and pasta type dishes. I tried some beef and pork which were also good too. There is also a Mexican restaurant and an Italian one. I liked the Mexican the best and thought the food was quite good. Beach: Lovely beach here! I was pleasantly surprised. I was very nervous going here because I read about bad beach erosion. The beach is coming back. It's not huge but there was more than enough room to walk around and have many chairs on the beach. The beaches next door were in horrible condition. There are artificial breakers in the water but these didn't pose much of a problem for me as there was enough room to swim and I tried to remember that these breakers are helping to prevent erosion. The water was beautiful and crystal clear, and the beach was very clean. From what I saw the Reef had the best beach in this area which more than made up for any small shortcoming that the hotel may have had. Service: Everyone at the hotel was very nice and generally helpful. Service to our room was generally prompt although one time we requested water and pillows they did not bring them and we had to call back 3 times, the items did not show up till the next afternoon. Not sure what happened there. Otherwise everyone was friendly and helpful. The Reef is a charming hotel with an excellent beach and lovely grounds. If you're not looking for the ultimate in luxury but just want a nice, comfortable place with some great benefits, and is more affordable, this is a great place. Also, there is no nightlife here. The hotel is dead at night...we had the whole place practically to ourselves a couple nights. We went into town for nightlife. I would definitely return to the Reef.

I often wonder if people were even staying at the same hotel that they review. I've seen very negative reviews for hotels and resorts and then had a great time there. You just need to make sure you aware of which country you are travelling to and that standards and cuisine often vary. This was roughly my 15th time to Mexico and my third to the Cancun/Mayan region. I was well aware of what I could expect booking a 3.5-4star All Inclusive Resort there. I would say that while certainly not perfect, The Reef Playacar exceeded my expectaions. Here's why: Firstly, the Reef Playacar is in one of THE BEST LOCATIONS on the entire Mayan Riviera. It's one of the only resorts that is walking distance to Playa Del Carmen. If you prefer a cab it take about 5 minutes and costs 50 pesos. Mexican cabs are safe as can be. The Reef also boasts one of the top beaches in the region. They have large sandbags sunk offshore which keep the beach from eroding. They are also fun to dive off of if you're into that sort of thing. The hotel has a small intimate feel with only about 200 rooms. The grounds are very well kept and the overall feel is quite clean. There were almost always maintanence people cleaning. Other than occasionally in the evening or the pool bar there is barely a wait for anything at the Reef. The service was overall quite good but did show the odd sign of disorganization. This is common in Mexico, even at 5 star resorts. The rooms were on the larger size and all have a patio or balcony. One dissapointmant was the lack of oceanview rooms. These seemed held for time share members and there were very few to begin with. The pools were a little small but well located and nice. Very refreshing on a hot day. The snack bar was tasty but not wonderful. I would recommend the pizzas or ribs. The Reef's biggest weakness was the buffet. I did have trouble finding food I enjoyed after breakfast was over. This is the most common complaint with nearly all all inclusives. The Reef is no different. Even the average 5 star resort serves up only OK food. I would definitely make reservations for the A La Cartes. While not gourmet, they are much better than the buffet. Please do not be put off by this, it's really one of the Reef's only downfalls and like I said, a very common problem with resorts in general. For the average price paid for the Reef it is a great value. Anyone comparing this resort to the others in the area is probably not comparing apples to apples. This is the best part of the Mayan Riviera to stay in for shopping, restaurants, and atmosphere. I would far rather stay at the Reef than one of the extravagant 5+ stars located in the middle of nowhere (and many are). If you are not overly picky, you will probably have a great time here. If you are... spend more or don't complain.", "Date": "February 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "CT", "Title": "\u201cThe Reef is great.\u201d", "Author": "philmgmt", "ReviewID": "UR13492542", "Content": "We were at the Reef Playacar from Feb 1 to Feb 10, 2008.

No hotel will ever be \"perfect\" to everyone so I figured I would give it a try. I'm not horribly picky but I'll give you the good and the bad of it. The Good: The resort looks so exotic and fun. It is built around a rainforest. There are no bugs at night and it was kept very clean. We upgraded to a room right by the pool for $30 more a night which was worth it. The room was clean and well kept. The buffet was good...not much variety which is expected. When you ask for more towels or soap they were very prompt and courteous. The pool was clean and the canopy beds were comfy. We took a cab to 5th ave for 5 bucks and had a great time. My boyfriend and I both said we would stay here again. The Bad: Do NOT EVER use the calling card company in the room. They charge $45 per phone call! I have been on the phone with them every day since I returned trying to get my money back. They did try to sell us stuff very briefly but we just said \"No\". That's all you have to do! The pool waiters didn't speak any english. The bottled water in the room nis $5 a bottle. The Bottom Line: If you are looking for a beautiful place to stay and not break the bank...The Reef is perfect.

I really don't know what these people were complaining about. I travel every year and usually stay in a 4+. This resort was way above my expectations. The rooms were not fancy but kept very clean. The cleaning staff was great. One day, by mistake, I left money in the bathroom and it was still there when I returned to the room. The service was excellent. We did not have to wait for drinks or service in the restaurants. This was a surprise because it has been my experience that when two women are travelling alone you do not get the service that couples get. The resort was smaller than I normally stay at but the service was exceptional. The only thing I was disappointed in was the beach. The water was great but since the hurricane they have lost alot of the beach. The RUI Palace is next to the Reef and their beach was pathetic. That would be my only complaint because I love to walk along the beach and you could not go very far. Otherwise, everything was great.

The resort grounds were beautiful. The beach is recovering from the recent hurricanes and is one of the largest beaches on the Playacar strip. There was plenty of room for any one who wanted to hang out on the beach and plenty of shade on the beach and around the pool. Small resort with a quiet atmosphere. Not much of a night life. The rooms were moderate, nothing fancy, but clean and adequate. The best time to get hot water was either in the morning or later in the evening. Between 3-6pm we only got a slightly warm shower. The tub was extra deep so I did enjoy many hot baths around 9 or 10pm or first thing in the morning. The balcony area was just large enough for four to enjoy and the view from the balcony was of the Jungle type area. Food- We enjoyed the Italian Restraunt the best, the Mexican was not to bad either. The daily buffet was bland which is typical with exception of the Pork Roast which was excellent and the Deserts were always good. We could always count on breakfast being good. There were always someth ing open to get a drink or food, you just had to remember which one was open. This was a little bit of a hassle. But it provided free exercise. There are NO ocean front or ocean view rooms that I could see. No elevators so if you are on the third floor you will be taken the stairs. Sometimes even on the first floor there were stairs going down. Basicly plan on stairs. We had done our research before we went and read many recent reviews here on Trip Advisor before we went. We were not disappointed when we got there. It was just about what everyone had said. My biggest complaints were the entertainment was really below average. The towels were always an ordeal. The towell staff leaves at 5pm so if your at the pool or beach after 5pm. You have to keep your towells and a $38.00us per towell is charged to your room. So then you have to go up to the front desk with your towells to get it taken off your bill. Even if you tried to turn them before 5pm. They would say they could not find your ticket and give you clean towels and you get charged again $38.00us for each towell. Back to the front desk to get it taken off. So at 4 towells per day for 8 days adds up to $1,216.00. That's not an added feature I want to see on my bill. So after having this happen more than once to my husband and friend. I started getting the towels and drawing a little something on the top and putting my room# on the top of the ticket which would help me find it for them. Because they could never find it. I also started taking the ticket after I turned it in the towels just in case. We were not charge when we left. We refused to pay for 4 towells that they said they had taken off the bill the first day and did not. Ok enough about that, I just thought it was improtant for everyone to understand how they try to make some extra money. Other than the towel thing we had a great time, it was so peaceful and relaxing. The beach was good enough for us and the other guest staying at the resort were all pleasant.

The food was okay, you can survive on a few items (breakfast is the best), drinks are your typical cheap liquior, unless you see the better quality on the shelf. And where the bikes are I have no idea. Every time we wanted to get a bike they would tell us the guy with the key was gone. We had a king bedroom on the third floor. The room was a good size for two, however, the sewege smell almost killed us. We would have to keep the patio door open and the window in the bathroom open at all times because of the smell. One day there was no hot water so I couldn't wash my hair and then on three occasions the water would just shut off in the middle of your shower. It would eventually come back on. The resort as a whole is about a 2.5 or 3 rating, not 3.5 to 4. It does have the best beach. There were a few activities at the pool, but never any music playing or any fun games like other hotels have. Bars didn't open until 11:30 pm so you couldn't get a bloody mary in the morning. However, the best bar and bartender is in the lobby in the evening. Can't remember his name, started with an H, but he is the best. The staff in the buffet and spa are very nice and friendly.

It's like you're on a nature walk all the way from the lobby, to your room and to the ocean / pools. Rooms Definitely exceeded our expectations and nicer than most hotels we've stayed in Mexico. Each room has a big balcony and comfy chairs. The beds are soft and bedding is nice. It is true...there are a few ants in the bathrooms. They didn't really bother us too much though. The staff comes to clean each morning and does a great job. Pools Two pretty big pools with many places to sit. Both are luke warm. The beds surrounding the pools are amazing. One has a swim-up bar. There is a stretching class and a step aerobics class around the pool each morning - they are fun and the staff is entertaining. Food Breakfast is awesome! Huevos Rancheros or make-your-own omelettes. Tons of fruit, pancakes, crepes, french toast, fruit / veggie smoothie bar. This was our favorite meal. Lunch is sub-par without many options. Dinner in the buffet was a little better, but the food in the Italian restaurant is awesome! Loved, loved, loved the dessert - and all the wine you could drink. Beautiful view from the restaurant. Getting reservations is a little work...just need to get to the lobby and get your name on the list by 9am. So much for sleeping in. We went into Playa del Carmen two nights for dinner. A variety of very nice restaurants to choose from and a 10-15 minute walk. Bars There are enough bars around that you only have to wait 3-5 minutes max for a drink - most times less.

I'll start with the Crown Paradise. The reason we decided to go was that from doing a lot of research on various resorts, we knew the Crown had the rep as a fantastic resort for kids. It did have a lot to do for the children, good kids club, water slides etc. However, this resort was extremely busy and there were as expected, a ton of kids. This resort in my opinion, was not a 5 star resort. Cancun, if you have not been there, is much like Daytona Beach, a ton of hotels lined up along an awesome coast, but no feel like you are in a quaint resort. The food was certainly not of 5 star quality that we had experienced elsewhere in Mexico. It was like staying in a Holiday Inn, but with lots for kids to do. If you are a couple with no children, I would not recommend this resort. Whe we got back to the Reff, which is rated a 4 star, all 15 of us were happy to be back. The food,believe me or don't exceeded the Crown. I had a piece of \"Prime Rib\" at the Crown that was as thin as any piece of beef I have ever eaten. At the Reef, you get what you pay for, decent food a at very decent price. There were not as many ala carte restaurants to choose from, in compariosn to the Crown, but the buffet for dinner and lunch, certainly was better at the Reef. As for the beach, they have started putting huge sand bags out in the water, and you can tell that this is helping to restore some of the beach, but people we were travelling with had been to Playa 10 years ago, and there is a lot of beach that has been lost. From what we saw and observed, the Reef actually has as much beach if not more, than some of the neighbouring properties. To give you an idea, the Reef is located right next door to the Riu and at the prices a RIU will charge, the Reef has as much beach. The rooms, we stayed in two different rooms at the Reef, the first had a bit of a musty smell, not unlike some others we have experienced while travelling south. The second room was much better. The first room was located in the 200 block, the second in the 300 block. Still not sure why the differnce.The one thing all first time travellers want to know......were the rooms clean...yes, they were. As for service, the Reef had excellent service. Maybe this is due to it being a smaller resort, but we never had any issues, including transportation and accomodations at the Crown in Cancun. Rafael the Manager at the Reef, has the staff in good working order. Playa itself is a great little town. Tons of shopping and great restaurants. I was a little hesitant to go into town at first, but after we went in once, we made sure that we went in again and experienced a great restaurant on the last night of our stay. All in all, a very good experience. We all agreed as we returned, we much prefered the Reef to the 5 star located in Cancun.", "Date": "January 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Marion", "Title": "\u201cOur Experience was Horrible\u201d", "Author": "swvatravelers", "ReviewID": "UR12403340", "Content": "I read one review here that said, \"The Reef Playacar is on the downhill slide.\" I could not have said it better myself. Like you reading these reviews, I had somewhat mixed emotions about going to this site for our 2007 Christmas vacation. I can only tell you my experience: We arrived, checked in, and was assigned a room. My wife and I discovered we had twin beds instead of a single as we had requested, but with the georgous tropical view, we decided to keep it. WRONG! A desk clerk ran into the room and said that we must hurry and leave because they had double booked the room and the occupants were on their way. I thought, \"What are we, cockroaches?\" We met the occupants of this room on the way out and they seemed to be a nice Indian family. We treked back to the desk and was given the keys to another room. It was in a horrible location overlooking a delapidated roof of a building and it stunk. We complained, and was given another room. In this room the air conditioner did not work and the ceiling fan was about to release itself from its attachment on \"low\" speed. We complained. The maintence man finally came and got it running. The noise was terrible. The maintence man said he had to get more tools and would be back. I noticed he took with him his current tools. He never came back. We complained. We were given two more rooms that were equally as bad and stunk. Finally, a desk clerk by the name of Pabalo said he would upgrade us to a new room. He did and it was more than satisfactory. We thanked him and told him we would keep this one. WRONG! The next day, (this is after my wife has unpacked everything and is in its proper place), later in the evening, I used the key to open the door and it did not work. I figured the magnetic part was messed up and I again treked to the front desk. The desk clerk, Luis, said that the manager, Rafael, said that we would have to move to another downgraded room (now it is after 5 PM and Rafael is gone). Otherwise we would have to pay an upgrade fee (expensive). Luis said that we would have to move even if we decided to upgrade because the \"owners\" were on their way. By this time I am angry. Luis, who was very hateful and indifferent to my complaints, reminded me that I was in Mexico. My wife reminded me that we should just suck it up and enjoy what time we have left. I took her advice and we will NEVER go back to this facility. The food: nothing great. The drinks: mine were not watered down. The service: horrible. The Dive shop: I booked a \"wall dive\" (more expensive) and when I went there was NO wall. It was a reef dive. In summary: you get what you pay for. However, in this case we didn't even get what we paid for. I have been to Mexico several times and it gets worse each time. It also gets more expensive. My next step is to contact my travel agency, Travel by Jen, and complain. If they do this again to me I will look for another agency. Additionally, we are going to look for another country to take our tropical vacations in.

Upon arrival we were immediately greeted, offered beverages, our bags handled and told our vacation begins now. Our room requests were accomodated as ordered. 1. We chose this resort because it is a smaller, family friendly environment. The resort is beautiful with windng paths throughout with lots of vegetation. Rooms are not fancy, but clean with everything functioning. We had no problems with either of the 2 rooms we had. 2. Staff is very friendly, outgoing, and helpful. Anytime we had any kind of request they were more than happy to accomodate us. Can only say positive things for the staff. We did not feel any pressure regarding timeshare with this resort. If you are not interested in timeshare just say no thank you and it will not be brought up again. 3. Food-Buffet, 2 restaurants, snack shack and ice cream bar. Service and food are good in all. If you are expecting a 5 star restaurant experience you will likely be disappointed.. However, we felt the food was good, the selection varied, and service good. No one in our family got sick and we did not limit any of our choices in any of the restaurants. 4. Beach-Awesome, we enjoyed the size of the beach and direct access to the water that the neighbouring resorts did not have. 5. Pools, marina etc. The pools were great, a great place to cool off and were never busy, the swim up bar is great. We took advantage of what the marina had to offer. We used the kayaks, katamarans, and snorkeled, all were great fun. 7. Playa Del Carmen is only a 10 - 15 minute walk from this resort. This was a very convenient bonus for us. We walked into town almost daily for shopping and other fun. The Reef Playacar is located in the gated, secured area of Playacar, we felt safe and secure at all times.

We did a side trip to the Mayan pyramid of Coba, a mayan village, and a cenote stop. It was all amazing and well worth the money.

Apparantly they are turning the Reef into a time share next year from what I heard and that's too bad because I would definitely go back there next year. I hope what I heard is not true. Everything was top notch. Large comfortable rooms with beds that are not rock hard. Service was excellent. We had a problem with the AC on arrival and it was dealt with in less than 10 minutes. My wife decided she wanted to move to a ground floor room to be closer to the pool and it was taken care of the next day by noon. This is a smaller resort so everything is close by which we liked a lot. The resort is very clean and well maintained. The beach was excellent. The 2 pools are close to the beach which is nice as you get the ocean breeze to lessen the the heat of the mid day sun. The food was more than adequate and quite good though if you are extremely fussy about selection and variety you may find a problem with the variety at the daily buffet. For me it was not an issue whatsoever. The 2 reserved restaurants, one Mexican, the other Italian were both excellent. I was somewhat concerned about security being so close to Playa Del Carmen but the hotel district where this resort is has 24 hour security so It was not an issue whatsoever. The nightly entertainment was very good and we attended and enjoyed every show we attended. All in all a very nice resort and I would highly recommend it. The only real negative I can share and I did not experience it personally was they are trying to sell time shares to the resort and from what I heard from other guests they were quite aggressive in their presentation. We did not attend the presentation so I am speaking from the perspective of others. It's optional so if you want to skip the hard sell to save a few bucks on a tour package then do so.

Not outstanding but good. It was hit and miss with the drink quality depending on the bartender I think, but it certainly didn't bother us any. Very helpful people at the activities centre too. Another real plus about the Reef that we didn't see at nearby resorts was the location design - a few buildings spread out with lots of trees and bushes surrounding. The place really gave the sense of being in a tropical forest and it allowed for privacy and some break from the sun. Being right on the water we had a wonderful breeze constantly. The room was everything we needed - air conditioning, comfy bed, lots of pillows and a deck that was semi-private. I really can't say enough about how perfect that resort was to visit. When you go into town though, you'll definately be wasting your time if you stop and talk to anyone that says they have information for you, or asks are you planning any tours or have you been to Cozumel or such. They'll offer cheaper tickets for these things but they want you to visit an hotel they are representing for a 2hr sales pitch. That does not include travel time to get to and from that hotel. We got sucked into this and I tell you it's not worth the savings to loose your vacation time. What my husband and I realized really sent them running was telling them we were leaving tomorrow. And right now, you'll get a better exchange rate getting money from your debit card than exchaning inside the bank at the teller or at the street exchange vendors. At least that was the case for my husband who used the Scotiabank machine (with a credit union card). We were sent to HSBC but the line-ups in there are terrible and they do not honour travelers cheques if you don't have a passport. At the Scotiabank they changed the travelers cheques with the same ID we entered the country with. I'm not a Scotiabank user but it was close and it worked. We took the boat across to Cozumel - it's really more of the same as Playa del Carmen. We made it fun by taking a scooter ride across the Island. We also went to Chetzen Itza. That's a long trip but I actually enjoyed the ride, the scenery and the air conditioning. The Mayan Ruins was interesting but the big detractor was the guide - nice man but he took both a spanish group and us so we had to wait around while he told them the same things and it really made for short descriptions. The cenotas we visited on the way back was well worth the heat and long trip. It was awe-inspiring to be in a cool pool of water where people thousands of years ago must have been.

Even then, it leaked so badly that the room was flooded each day. 3 calls to the front desk didn't resolve the problem. I had to go there and complain to the manager. Both our rooms had about 1/2 of the lights non-working. My room had a steady line of ants in the bathroom. We had warm water only once in a while. One day we had only air when we turned on the faucet. Don't bother with 'do not bother me' sign for the maid. She ignores it. One time I came back to the room to find her watching TV while making the bed. I pointed to the sign and told her we asked for no service today. She didn't seem to have any idea what the sign meant. The TV only worked part of the time and the sink in the ant infested bathroom didn't drain. The food..... The buffet was 'ok'. But the choices didn't change, the quality was pretty low, and the service was terrible. When the buffet was supposed to open at 11:30....it would open at 11:40 something. However, the grills were still unmanned and food was not ready for 15 minutes later. Acutally, all food, bars, and stores would open late and close early. The worst was the store closing early when I needed medicine. The girl was still there, but, just gave the big 'tough crap' smile that they do whenever they are agreeing to do something that they don't intend to actually do. The food at the 'snack bar' by the pool was horrible. The pizza was almost raw. The cheeseburgers arrived 10 minutes before the fries. If there were more than 4 people in there, expect a 45 minute wait. The Italian restaurant was good, but, the Mexican one was non-edible food that arrived a full hour after ordering. Service at the restaurants, buffet, and snack bar was generally slow. The drinks were watered down. The marina.... THE SHINING STAR. These guys and gal (Laura) were really great. The catamaran lessons with Luis were fun and informative. The kayaks were awesome. The scuba demo was very worth doing. The boogie boards were always there.

I was a little nervous, but it seemed like the good outweighed the bad. The grounds were beautiful. I really liked how tropical the 'villas' were , it wasn't some huge concrete castle like the Riu next door. It had a very cozy feel. My sister and I really enjoyed ourselves until she got sick. Here are my comparisons to what I read on here. ROOMS- Very nice, no funky smell and our air conditioning worked great in the night it was actually too cold. House keeping was great! I left 2 bucks everyday and not only did we get the normal housekeeping service, but they folded our clothes we left around and organized the toiletries we had scattered about. All the staff I came in contact with were more than polite and accommodating. POOLS/BEACH - the pools were always clean and we never had a problem getting beach chairs(and we didn't have to get up at 7am to do so) The beach was small, but not tiny plenty of room to enjoy yourself. The ocean is a bit rocky though. FOOD - With the exception of breakfast it was Very bland! we ate at the snack bar mostly. The drinks were iffy. Sometimes you'd get a good pina colada sometimes not. Don't bother with the reservation restaurants the portions were tiny and the food was ugh. ACTIVITIES- We took diving lessons in the pool with Z (totally HOT) We also went snorkeling out at the coral reef. We wanted to go to Tulum so instead of booking with a tour group for way too much money. We took a cab for 40 or 45 US each way and paid $4 to get in to see the ruins. Do yourself a favor and wear your bathing suit and go to the beach there it is soo gorgeous! THE BAD: So the night before we are supposed to leave my sister got violently ill. Diarrhea, vomiting the entire night. I was unsure if she'd be able to make the trip to the airport., but a fellow traveler gave her a Dramamine and she made it through the 45 min ride. She even threw up in the airport. I'm not sure of the exact cause, but it seems like a lot of people who stay here get very ill.

I got married at this resort and had 16 guests stay with us there. We loved the resort. We like that it's smaller then others andbecause there are sprawling jungles throughout the grounds, you hardly every feel crowded. I never waited more then 5 minutes for a drink. There were a few instances where someone who spoke spanish was served in the buffet before me but I just butt in and gave them my order. The one thing I did do it tip and often. These people work around the clock and they aren't paid much. I got to know several of the entertainers and they explained that in Mexico it's normal to work 16 hour days. So I tiped the maids, the bartenders, busboys, bellman and everyone. I just made sure to take $50 in one dollar bills and they know you by name. By the end of the 8 days they knew us all by name and we had a blast. My cable worked, some only got a few channels. My AC was REALLY good and sometimes TOO good. But my room was cleaned everyday and the first night they put hearts made of flowers on our bed. The night of our wedding they did the same thing but made swans out of towels and provided us compleentry robes. The Reef marina was great too. we did the dive demo and were sold. So my husband and I along with one other friend went diving. They even checked with the hyperbaric doctor to see if my mother could dive with her blood pressure medication. She could't but down there you never know what scuba place would have just let her go. That meant alot to me. They even let us dive 30 minutes longer then most resorts do. Piece of advise, if you want reservations for the resturant be at the guest service desk right at 9:00am, as they fill up super fast. While the food isn't the best, i did gain 4lbs while we were there. The beach is very private and we did all the activites. We were snorkeling in front of the beach and my husband found a diamond ring...believe it..it's true. But you can see cool things just snorkeling. We used the boogie boards, snorkels, and catamaran. I got a massage in the spa, it's more expensive then the US but it was very good. The gift shop is over priced (like they always are) so if you need something like a gift walk from the hotel to the 5th ave (20mins max) and shop. Super fun. As far as the wedding, I did pay for addtional services in a package through cancun wedding planners but that really covered the photographer, cake, videographer and minister. It was 20Xs better then I ever imagined. It was incredible, showing people at work, I got more gasps then I ever imagined. Guests even gathered in the back to watch. One couple on their honeymoon was so moved they asked them to do a vow renewal. All and all it was a great experience. For the price I couldn't imagine getting anything better. The only negative i have to say is that when my mother checked out she was charged for 4 divers when one canceled and we were assured he wouldn't owe as they had a full boat. But they told her that she had to pay and because it was early and the dive shop wasn't open she just had to and worry about it later. So that was a bit upsetting, so just be sure that if you are doing something that you commit to it.

We had an okay time, at best. We made the best of it and still had fun, but because we ventured elsewhere and just laid on the beach..... I will try to be as candid as possible in this review, as I relied on TripAdvisor heavily during our planning process. The main thought I have regarding our vacation is \"You get what you pay for\". Don't go for the cheap rate, pay a little more and stay somewhere else!! The Food Was absolutely terrible. Lunch was recycled into dinner and then dinner into breakfast. There was hardly any variety and they didn't keep the raw meats that you can get cooked to order cold at all, it was just sitting next to a hot grill. Everything was a mystery item and just scary looking. The only good part about the food was the breakfast, I suppose. Very simple breakfast choices such as pancakes, eggs, omelettes cooked to order and fresh fruit. There was always lots of fruit available. The snack bar was okay, they had burgers, rotisserie chicken and the like.... we ate at the reservatoin only place one night for dinner and it was just a joke.... we left before the desert was even served. The Service The service was hit-or-miss.... when we sat down in the restaurant no one would ever come up to us to take our drink order, so my husband went up to the bar to get our drinks after 10 minutes or so and that apparently irritated them beyond belief. As an American, I really feel as if we were the minority here and were treated unfairly in regards to service. The first day we tipped everyone we came in contact with and it didn't help at all, they wouldn't remember you and eventually we just stopped tipping The Grounds The grounds are absolutely beautiful. This resort is very tropical, with lush vegitation and animals/reptiles everywhere. I really enjoyed the \"feel\" of the place. The room Was okay. It was fairly clean, except for a few stray unmentionable hairs in the bathtub and some mold on the wall. We reserved a king room but since we checked in later in the evening, there were none available. We were given a \"junior suite\" but it had 2 double beds. This class of room has a separate balcony with 4 lounge chairs and a jacuzzi. The two major problems that I had with the room is that the jacuzzi was filled with old, moldy, leafy water and was not cleaned until I asked twice. Once it was cleaned, we realized that there was no hot water line, the drain plug didn't work (and you couldn't rig it up, either) and the jets didn't turn on either. What a waste. I asked the front desk (including the last time when I spoke with the manager) to look at it 4 separate times, and it never got fixed. The other problem was that upon arrival, there was no phone in the room!! When we requested one, they brought one that had no pre-programmed buttons on it and we had no guide to even know how to call the front desk. Housekeeping They were okay, nothing great. Didn't do anything extra even after being tipped 5 bucks. No towel swans/animals, etc. On our last full day, we arrived back to the room ready to take our showers and there was one towel!! OMG I was so mad I couldn't see straight. I personally walked up to the front desk and politely asked for at least 1 more towel, they said they would send it, but it never did appear. So we had to share the same little thin towel between the two of us. Construction Yes, it's true. This place has recently begun a major renovatioin of their rooms. And of course, the building they were working on was right across from ours. So we awoke every morning at 8 am to a loud tile cutter. Nice. Maybe that is why we got such a cheap rate. Location The location is good in relation to playa del carmen. a nice 10-15 minute walk with mayan ruins on the way that you can explore, or a 5 dollar cab ride. We walked once and then took the cab the rest of the times. Beach Was beautiful! Yes it is small, but there is tons of room for swimminig and such, and bring your own snorkeling equipment and see lots of angel fish and other sea life right off the beach. It is a nice walk up the beach, although you do have to navigate through some retaining walls, etc. Entertainment Was awful. We watched the \"70's\" show one night and it was terrible. We also watched about half of the \"mayan\" show and just went to the bar. The entertainment staff did do a good job keeping activities going in the activity pool throughout the day. Pools There are two pools, one larger that they use for water polo, games, etc. and one smaller that has the swim-up bar. They were very warm, but fairly clean and nice to take a dip in. Plenty of lounge chairs available. No towel games go on here, so don't worry, sleep in (if you can handle the tile cutter 100 feet away) Drinks Were good. They did have some mid grade alcohol such as smirnoff, jose cuervo and tanquerray. The only beer available was Dos Equis. The strawberry margaritas were good. If you want premium alcohol in your drink, you have to ask otherwise you will get whatever junk they had. And when you are ordering, if you want a strong, decent drink just ask for a double. They were happy to oblige most of the time. The drinks saved my vacation, as sad as that is. It was about an hour ride to/from the airport, and wasn't that bad. All in all, I was not very satisfied with the place, but the main complaint I have is regarding the service and the food. This place needs to step up. And it didn't help being right next door to the Riu Palace.... that place was beautiful, however I would have been ticked to have gotten one of the many many rooms there that overlooked the Reef Playacar.

The beach was small, but not too incredibly crowded, granted it was off-travel season. The grounds itself are very pretty with small buildings built around a winding garden path. We always found plenty of seating inside and out. The Mexicana show we attended was also very enjoyable. The Funjet Reps (Julio and Monserrat) were incredibly nice and helpful. The bad: Do not use the \"concierge\" or the \"travel agency\" for anything. You will be forced to attend a \"rewards club\" breakfast meeting, which is essentially a time share scam. If you book through Funjet, stick with the Funjet Reps. The rooms are okay, but just that: okay. The food is sub-average. My wife and I both had digestive problems, and after talking with a few other guests, we discovered we weren't the only ones. On one evening, my wife was incredibly ill from dehydration. I called the front desk, and they said the doctor on sight would be $80 just for a consultation. We decided to go into town to the Cruz Roja because we knew all she needed was a saline IV. I had accidentally left my cell phone sitting out, and when we returned 4 hours later it was gone. We had locked everything inside our bags every time we left, but it had slipped my mind this one time in the rush to get to the doctor. I reported my missing phone to Monserrat, and she did everything she could with the hotel, but they wanted me to fill out a missing property report. After this, they did their \"investigation.\" The investigation partially consisted of a search of our room, which would make sense to see if the phone actually was there or if there were any security breaches in the room. However, this also included a search of all of our luggage and personal belongings, including some very sensitive items (hey, we were honeymooners) while we sat nervously by. 24 hours later, they told me that the room locks revealed no one else had entered the room, and rehashed that they could not be held liable for anything lost/stolen/missing from the room. They said I could do a report with the Policia, but since I was leaving the next day I found little point in that. In closing, I would not recommend this resort. It is not worthy of the Four Star rating.

Upon our arrival to Cancun we were hit with the resort tour people as we came through the depature door, they act as if they are helping you, but it's a sales pitch. We finally found our shuttle to The REEF resort. I had personal issues, I need to get to my room ASAP, we were told we must see the conciege first, she's there to sell you tours and try to get you to sit through a time share presentation, I wasn't willing to do that, I wanted to freshen up first and get some dinner. We were taken to an assigned room which had other guest in bed resting, we had to go right back to the front desk to get another room. I tried to reserve a dinner in the italian restaurant for my birthday dinner, and was told I had to come to the lobby the day before by 9am to reserve a spot. We came here to rest and relax, not run up to the lobby each day to reserve a spot in the restaurant. We decided to eat at the \"CHULA VISTA \"buffet , it was alright nothing to write home about. I did get sick after eating the Salmon, later I found that another guest got sick after eating the Salmon. They leave the meat and fish out before cooking it, I didn't see how they kept it cold. The worst day was our last, after checking out by noon we waited for our shuttle back to the airport it was due to pick us up at 2:30 pm, for our 6 pm flight. I was informed by another guest our flight was delayed till the next day 3:00 am, I went to the front desk to get more information and was handed a note from a FunJet representative, that we would be picked up at 11:45 pm.how was I to know of our delay? We asked if we can get our back room while we waited, we were denied unless we paid $200. US dollars per person, we only need a place to rest till 11:pm, my husband need to be at work at 4 am., soon as we arrive to DFW he need to go directly to work. We needed a room to rest, they only gave us a hospitality room for one hour, to shower and freshen up. This resort wasn't full to capacity, we had a sick guest with us they showed no compassion, we offered to help pay for a room for her to lay down if the cost was reasonable, but ended up we sitting in lobby chairs till 11pm. No explination or apology for the delay. The resort blamed FunJet, Funjet blamed Ryan International airline, but no one helped us out We arrved to DFW at 5:45am the following morning, but had to wait on the plane till 6am when imigration opened up. Over all the resort was beautiful, but once they got your money, and your visit is over, they kick you to the curb.

After reading other reviews I wasn't expecting too much, but was pleasantly surprised. The Reef is smaller than the other resorts, but I think that is a bonus. It makes it easier to get around. The pools were very nice. We had no trouble finding chairs. The beach was small, but plenty of room for swimming. We took advantage of the free boogie boards, sail boats, kayaks and bikes. The food was OK, nothing great, but nothing too bad either. The snack bar was very good, lots to choose from. We didn't have any trouble getting good drinks form any of the bars. The sports bar was fun, it was nice to have a place to go watch the game, or in our case the fight, w/o having to leave the hotel. We only went to 1 of the shows, but it was very good. I've been to other resorts where the shows are cheesy, but this one was actually well done. The rooms were fine. The beds were comfortable but the AC wasn't that great. We were on the 3rd floor w/a cute balcony overlooking the pedestrian path, nice to sit and watch the people walking by. The room did have a fridge, but it was never stocked. Water is not included in the \"all inclusive\" price, which is strange, but you can buy the local brand for $1 or pay $5 for fancy name brand. You could also walk up the street to the store and buy a big bottle there for even less. The timeshare people were a little pushy, but they were easy enough to avoid.

The layout was good and I like the jungle theme. Food - OK. Had some good and had some mediocre. More mediocre than good. We never bothered with anything besides the buffet or the snack area so I can't speak to the 'main' restraurants. The snack food was pretty good and I did enjoy the burgers. I had no issues with the bar service. Room - The room looked good and I like the frig but our AC absolutely sucked. While it was never hot, it was never cool either. I'd give the resort 4 stars if not for this. I did complain and a service guy looked at it but it was still bad. All in all, it was on us too as we didn't ask for a room change. On the last day, I popped into an open room to compare the temp and yeah, the other room felt just fine. Staff - OK, I guess. We dodged the host and the time share pitch (by the way they offered us 100 resort dollars) and so we never used him to help with anything. We had no issues with any of the other staff.

Our trip was from June 9-16, 2007. Our group consisted of 12 adults. If you want to pay over $1,000 and stay at a resort that is less than Motel 6 quality, please go to this resort. For anyone who has any type of disability, back problems, etc. this resort is NOT for you! I have had back surgery. My husband has bad knees. Another traveler also has trouble with ankles and knees. Everything at this resort is steep stairs. The resort put us up on the 3rd floor. The steps are not gradual but very steep. By the 3rd day, I was begging the front desk to move us. I was in such pain that I wanted to go back home. The Funjet people were not helpful at all. Each time one of us complained, all we got was promises. The Funjet man, Victor, told us that he would move all of us to another resort if we would wait a day. Our waiting lasted four days. We kept going back to talk to him and he was never there. Finally, we found him and then he told us we would have to pay $65 per person per day to go to another resort. As you can see, for a group of 12 people, the money would add up fast. Our room was broken into twice through the patio doors. Our clothes and luggage had been gone through. I reported to both the FUNJET people and the front desk. A very expensive camera was stolen out of one of the other rooms. You have to pay $1/day for water and $2/day for a lock to the safe in your room. Actually, the safe lock is nothing more than a key to a magnet. Anyone could use the same key to get into any room. We kept our money and passports with us at all times. This resort is shown in the FUNJET book as a 4 star resort. Don't believe it. The most would be a 2 star. I have been to many resorts in the area and by far this is the worst. The food is the same every day. They had a big roach on the cantaloupe one day. The only decent food was at the snack bar. Four people in our group got food poisoning. Several days we got burned out dried meat. We only got bacon two out of the seven days we were there. We landed in Cancun before 5:00 PM. After getting on the bus around 5:20 PM, we did not get to Playa del Carmen until after 9:00 PM... at the most it is 45 minutes from the airport. The bus never got out of third gear. The Funjet bus stopped at a restroom not far from the airport. You had to pay a $1 to use the restroom and a woman stood out front and gave you approx. 5 tissue square. Then, the bus would not back up. It seemed as though the transmission was out on the old bus. Some of our luggage was left at another resort. We did not get it until 2:00 AM in the morning. And we only got it then because we argued with them. I paid the front desk $40 to hurry up and give us a room. My husband had just gotten out of the hospital the day before and was exhausted. The room was on the 3rd floor. All of the people other than our group that had booked their stay at the Reef from Funjet complained as well. There were several couples from Louisiana who had a bad time as well. Don't be fooled by pictures of the resort and the beach. Those pictures must have been taken when the hotel opened several years ago. Even the Funjet representatives said that the resort was old and run down. The activities staff were rude. The place was totally depressing. I even called the Funjet corporate office from Mexico to the states to no avail. We had to wait until we got back. I am waiting to hear back from our travel agent. There was only one bartender at one bar at one time. In other words, when the pool bar was open, the other bars were closed. At night, the snack bar at the pool was open, but you had to walk all the way to the front to get anything to drink. I have stayed at many nice resorts in the area, but the Reef is really bad. I am not one to complain much because Mexico is not as advanced as the U.S. and their ratings are different. However, Funjet totally misrepresented this trip. I will definitely not go back to this resort. Some of the smaller hotels around 5th Avenue were basic and clean. I would recommend staying in one of them. Some of the places I would recommend are the Riu resorts (Palace, Playacar [great beach], Tequila, Lupita), the Viva Maya (has a great beach!! and lots of activities), the Allegro resort, the Palace Resorts, and the Gran Porto Real. The resort was full of small children. I thought I was at a daycare. I can go on with the complaints, but it won't solve anything. If you want to go to an inexpensive resort and pay the price for a nice resort, please go to the Reef. If you don't expect much, then you won't be dissappointed. The people at the Dive Shop are extremely nice and helpful. While you are in Playa del Carmen, go see the Fire Show at the Blue Parrot. It is fantastic!! It is a nice outdoor club. We really enjoyed it.

The rooms were clean and comfy and all have balconies. And yes the beds were firm not concrete. But I like a firm bed anyway and had no trouble sleeping.

As for the food book the resturants for dinner. Breakfasts were good and lunch at the buffet was better than dinner. The pools are very clean with plenty of lounges. As far as the beach goes it's small but the sand terraces make up for it.

Now I'm not a blue collar worker like one of the reviewers said before and I still enjoyed this resort. By the way what's wrong with blue collar workers? Anyway, let's get some of the negatives out of the way. Yes the beds were a bit hard but we had no problems sleeping. The food was a bit predictable and there was nothing too exciting, except the ceviche that they had at the Mexican restaraunt, that was really good. They alternate having the Mexican restaraunt open one night and then the Italian the next. As a result the buffet would have the leftovers from whatever restaraunt was open the night before. The beach was a bit small but there were plenty of chairs either on the mid level tier in front of the pool or on the lower beach on the north side by the towel cabana. There are some stones in the water but not enough to keep us from swimming. Also I'm not sure why there are mini fridges in the room because they were never stocked with anything. I guess they were there in case you wanted to put something in them. The positives definitely outweighed the negatives. We booked two rooms through Expedia and the only requests we put down were one room with a king bed and one room with two queens. When we checked in we were pleased to find out that not only were those requests taken to heart but that the rooms were adjoining and that way were able to keep an eye on the kids easier. The rooms were also on the top floor and I think that helped keep the noise down. The staff was always there to please and went out of their way to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. This was across the board from housekeeping to the bartenders at the swimup bar. The only time I tipped extra was at the restaraunts at night and that was because our waiter was extremely friendly and made sure we were taken care of. Like I mentioned before the food was not exciting but it was a big enough variety to keep us happy for the week. Breakfast always provided an omelet bar and fresh pastries. Plus they have an esspresso machine where you can get shots, add a bit of hot water and you have an Americano. Even my wife, the pickey coffee drinker was happy with it. We didn't eat much lunch since we were either on the beach or by the pool drinking our weight in cerveza but the kids enjoyed the snack bar with a choice of hamburgers, pizza, nachos, or enchiladas. I covered dinner earlier, either Italian or Mexican on alternating nights or the always open buffet. There's the old saying that you get what you pay for and the Reef is exactly that.

Consider booking through VacationExpress, even if you only book the hotel through them and not the flight (they were cheaper than any other source I could find).

I am assuming some may have not stayed at another resort in the area to use as a reference point. The food was terrible. My husband can pretty much eat anything, but was totally turned off by the available choices. The highlight seemed to be the pasta served everynight. And, the selection at the buffet was pretty much the same every night. Thank goodness for rolls and fresh fruit. All inclusive does not include bottled water??? The hotel claims the water is filtered, however, throughout the compound, you watch the servers pouring water out of very large water containers. So who is willing to take a chance with the tap water??? You are also charged for the lock for the safe in your room. I think the lock may be the phototype for the very first one made, ever! My daughter's room was a disaster. The sink pipe leaked and she almost slipped and fell on several occasions from the water on the wet slick marble floor. Her phone did not work, nor did the remote for the TV. This was all reported on the first day, and nothing was ever fixed. We also dealt with faulty pumping in another room. No coffee machines in the rooms. You have to walk, quite a distance, depending on the location of your room, to get a cup of coffee in the morning. The walls are paper thin; You can hear EVERY thing! The ocean front and beach is so small, I have seen private homes with more. And if you want to swim, I hope you like a the pool. Bring a day planner with you to coordinate when the various bars are actually open. If you are not in the area of the open bar, prepare for a hike across the hotel grounds. These bars are not only for alcoholic beverages, but for ANY and ALL drinks. There are not any self serve beverage dispensers available. The ice cream parlor is open from 3PM until 5PM, so highlight those hours. Having stayed at various other hotels in the area, I am very much used to being pampered. This was not the case at the Reef.

Well, the Windham Mayan is far from a comparable resort. Infact, I would not suggest staying here! The beach was closed, the main restaraunt is on the second floor of a building and very, very hot! The food quality was poor as well. The following day we went back to the Reef to complain. Because I am in a wheelchair I am very recognizable. The same receptionist was there when we arrived. It was obvious he recognized us when we came through the door! We told him we were far from satisfied with the accomodations at the Windham Mayan. He told us he was only a receptionist and could not help us. I asked to speak with his supervisor who told us the same thing. I asked to see the Managing Dirrector who's name was posted behind the receptionists desk. We waited quite some time but were able to speak to him. After some \"arm-twisting\" he arranged for us to stay at the Windham Azteca but told us we would have to pay an additional charge. I argued this with him and eventually we were moved there at no charge. The Windham Azteca is a comparable resort and we were satisfied with the accomdations there. The second week of our vacation we stayed at the RIU Yucatan ( we have stayed at RIU Playacar many times in the past). We were very satisfied with the RIU Yacatan. The food, service and accomdations were excellent. The RIU's are slightly more expensive than some of the others resorts but well, well worth the extra money. A couple hundred bucks will make a huge difference in how satisfied you are. The moral of this story is we will only stay at RIU in the future as we have never been disappointed there. As a note, we met a travel agant while on vacation who told us she knew the Reef was sold out and continued to take reservations.

People like that should just stay home!!! The beaches were small. We all read that before we got there. Did you expect them to suddenly be big? The staff at the marina worked hard to please and they do a great job for what they had available to them. The food was great for a buffet style all inclusive. There was never a time where we couldn't find something that we were interested in. Both the Mexican and Italian restaurants were great. If you weren't happy with the food you could always take the walk or ride to town. The rooms are something that many of the reviews that I read complained about. The \"musty smell\" that people reffered to is called humidity with a hint of ocean. The loud rooms, well it's an all inclusive and some folks come to blow off steam. The Reef is not to blame if the drunken gringos don't have enough respect for other folks to be quiet. Our room was always clean, our airconditioner worked great and the room was far from loud. And finally the most annoying review I read was in regards to the staff at the Reef. If you didn't like these hard working, always polite and smiling, jovial folks, then there is something wrong with YOU, not them. They work thier butts off to clean up after ungrateful tourists and to run a tight ship. Many of the employees work two and three shifts in a day. Humberto in the lobby bar (great guy and bartender) works six days a week. They were all fun and they realize that there is a ton of competition in the area from other resorts so they do all they can to keep you happy. If you go to the Reef, please bring some cash for tips as they really don't get paid squat. Also, no matter how bad or non-existant your Spanish skills are, try to use them. You will find that it is greatly appreciated and a quite humorous for both parties creating a generally happy atmosphere. I meant what I said, if you don't like this quaint little slice of heaven then stay home as there is clearly something wrong with YOU!!!", "Date": "March 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Detroit", "Title": "\u201cTotal waste of money... do NOT go here!\u201d", "Author": "titanrook", "ReviewID": "UR7162195", "Content": "They should have named this \"resort\" the Thief Playacar as I had my passport, wallet, and cell phone stolen the first night of my stay.

We were there from Feb 24th to Mar 3rd/07. We all thought the hotel was just beautiful. Lot's of charm, very cozy....not like the concrete jungle of the RIU next door. Staff was great, always hard working and always saying Hola! We did leave a little tip on our pillow every morning for our maid, she worked really hard at cleaning the rooms. We were suprised at how much she does each day, per room!! Check in was quick, we asked for our room to be central, on the top floor and to be facing the garden. We got exactly what we wanted. Loved the tropical feel of the garden between the buildings. Lot's of geckos, large geckos, birds and even this other little animal that my boys just loved seeing. The rooms were very nice, all with balcony's. What we didn't care for was that majority of the channels on the tv were in Spanish. More English channels would have been better. The person that commented below on the rooms being noisy was correct. We could alway hear our neighbours coming to their rooms in the evenings or leaving early in the morning, seems like the doors like to slam shut on their own. The food was great....definitely NO complaints! We never ate at the Mexican restaurant, I saw the menu and I knew that my boys wouldn't like anything on it, but I would have! We ate at the Italian restaurant twice and the food was excellent!!! I never had any problems making reservations and I always got the times that I was hoping for. The buffet restaurant was really good as well. Plenty of fruit, cold salads, hot foods prepared in front of you. The snack bar had yummy food. Great pizza's, good burgers and quesidilla's. I already miss the guacemole and salsa!! I do have to say though the service at the snack bar was horrible at times. We loved the ice cream parlor, it's open from 3 pm to 6 pm!! Lot's of bars to get drinks and the drinks were really great. I never felt the need to tip the bartenders, I always got great service. Loved the swim up bar, always lots of action there and a great place to mingle and meet new people. The beach was by far the biggest disappointment, but that's not the hotel's fault. There are two sections of the beach to access, one of the left and then to the right with the terrace in-between. The terrace is now repaired, no more sink holes like some of the pictures posted above. The beach to the left was small, but there was more then enough room to put a lounge chair and enjoy the ocean view. My sons has fun playing there every day. We did try and go for a walk along the beach, but could only walk on the right side of the hotel. We could walk past the RIU hotel, their beach is very rocky, and then up to the hotel next to the RIU, but that's it. I knew this before booking so I won't be complaining. For what we used the beach for, it was more then adequate. I cannot comment on any of the excursions, we never did any. We felt that our sons wouldn't appreciate them for the price that we would have to pay to do them. We also did not take the ferry to Cozmel. We did take a taxi into Playa Del Carmen three times. I would have liked to have walked, about a 20 minute walk from the Reef, but the kids would have been tired by the time we got to 5th Avenue, we just paid the $5 cab fare. Definitely go to 5th Avenue. Lots of night life, lots of shopping and definitely bargain with the street vendors. The actual stores, you cannot bargain with them, I tried and their prices are set prices. Beautiful Mexican ceramics, I wish that I had brought home more. My sons used the Kids Club twice, had fun doing crafts and watching some movies. The animation team at the Reef is excellent. We only went to one show....Mr. Reef and we laughed and laughed. The show was hilairous!! The pools were wonderful. Two big pools and the pool with the swim up bar had an attached kiddie pool. We never had any problems finding spots on the beach or by the pool. Maybe because of the time of year that we went. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to everyone, young, old, married, families....loved it!!

We booked through TNT vacations. We were pleasantly surprised. The first room we had was on the first floor (building 6) and the view was blocked by construction and the room was a bit musty. We asked for a different room and was given one the next day (we had checked in late that day so nothing else was available). The next room had a great garden view and no musty smell but only had 1 bed (we were two adults and two kids...) so we asked again to be moved. The desk-man apologized for moving us from 2 beds to 1 bed and right away were given a very nice 3rd floor room with two beds facing the ocean and VERY close to the pools and restaurants. I was polite in dealing with the desk staff and they were friendly in helping me switch rooms (including the poor bell-man who helped move my bags a total of 3 times). We loved this room and it was kept very neat and clean by the staff. At one point my son contracted the flu and was sick for two days. We asked for all the sheets to be changed and they happily did this for us. Since my son was sick on the day we scheduled our Xcaret excursion, I had to find some way to make a last minute postponement to later in our trip. The desk staff helped me to make this postponement since I am deaf and could not use the phones myself. They made the calls themselves and they waited for the tour company to call back and confirm it. I was GREATLY relieved by this. We ate two times at the Botticelli (the Italian restaurant). The food is excellent there. The ma\u00eetre d' was very friendly, asked about our trip and even our childrens age. Off hand we mentioned our son would be turning 6 soon and he told us if we came back he would sing happy birthday (at this point in time our son had fallen asleep so they couldn't do it then). We did come back and he did remember us. We did not remind him of his promise but sure enough, the lights dimmed and out came the wait staff and ma\u00eetre d' singing happy birthday to our very surprised son. It was one of the highlights of our trip. We did not get a chance to eat at the Terrazi Grille because it booked up too quickly. If you want to go there I suggest you start waiting 30 minutes before reservations open up (around 9:30 am). Yes, its open now. We ate our breakfasts at Chulavista and it was interesting to try the different Mexican breakfasts (I liked Heuvos Rancheros). You can also ask for made-to-order omelets. Just pick out your fillings and hand it to the chef. Seating and service is fast. We ate lunches at the deli/grille. Sometimes the line appears to move a bit slow. I think this is because people keep moving around and it confuses the staff. But the service is friendly and the food tastes good. My family and I made use of the water sports. I found the staff to be friendly and helpful. They offered boogie boards to our kids before we even thought they would want them (they did). I took the hobie cats out twice and found them to be in good sailable condition. I caught some nice breezes offshore and zipped around. You want to stay in front of the dropoff. The staff let me use the free scuba 'demo' time (10am every day) to practice my scuba (I was certified in 2001 but haven't dived since). My wife did outdoor aerobics several times. She enjoyed the workout and it was fun to do it outdoors. I played in the water volleyball games but I must warn you, some of the staff cheats in a completely funny way that basically made everbody feel comfortable doing the same. I only went to a couple of the nightshows. The first one had the staff performing song and dance routines in a mostly humorous way. There is a Mexican fiesta night where they serve traditional Mexican faire and then you're treated to some historical and cultural songs and dances. You should try to make this if you are not going to places like Xcaret where they already have these dinner shows. We booked through TNT vacations and we found the representative there to be very helpful. He helped us find the right excursions for our family, made sure we made it to the buses, and also saw us off on our last day. We booked all our excursions through our TNT rep (avoiding the time-share spiel).", "Date": "February 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Macleod, Canada", "Title": "\u201cA great little resort!!!!\u201d", "Author": "LeeBrown", "ReviewID": "UR6841905", "Content": "We stayed at the Reef February 4 - 18, 2007.

The staff were always pleasant to deal with. We left our maid $2.00 U.S. plus a little gift every morning. A little courtesy goes along way, we always had extra water and beer in the fridge and a cute little animal folded from the bath towels. Rooms were always spotless and well kept. The food was average in the buffet but we always found something to fill out stomachs. We went to the Italian restaurant twice and it was very good. We did not do the Mexican as we ate Mexican most everday anyway. The bar staff were more than pleasant if you tried to use a little spanish and a small tip went a long ways too. Salvador and Theresa were always great and remembered us and went out of their way to please us. The pools were great and even the small beach on the ocean was delightful. We had a few green flag days and took full advantage of them. We had fun playing in the waves. They fixed the terrace area where there was a big sink hole in the sand. They filled it all in and it was good for go. We walked into Playa Del Carmen several times (about a 15 minute walk to 5th Avenue) and always fun there. An afternoon at Senor Frogs was just a blast and Carlos and Charlies kept us hopping too!! We took the ferry to Cozumel on a raining windy day and it was a very interesting ride for sure...thought we were in the movie \"The Perfect Storm\" for awhile. We snorkeled in Cozumel but was not that great due to the damage from the hurricanes. We took the tour to Coba and had a great time, no complaints there. We also took the Jungle Crossing tour and it was just amazing, great great snorkeling in a bay, kayaking and swimming in the cenotes and a cavern swim that was just amazing!! Helen our guide, was just fantastic. We also went to Xcaret and Xel Ha. Saw the night show at Xcaret and it was very good. Snorkeled again at Xel Ha and it was pretty good too. These two places were very busy indeed. The weather was not great while we were there. Alot of rain, but usually cleared up to a decent afternoon. We still came home with good tans. Overall, it was a very pleasant experience. We are all from Canada, and they just love the Canadians there. Again the resort was awesome, clean and a great jungle setting when walking to and from rooms. The RIU Palace was right next door and it looked like a big marble prison. We much preferred the laid back, Mexican feel to this resort. Lots of kids there the second week, so it is definitely a family resort. We probably would never go back to that area of Mexico as it is very busy and very touristy. There is about 15 resorts all in a row. We were spoiled by the peace and quiet at the Barcelo in Costa Rica and would go back there for sure.

We had a very good time. The hotel was very beautiful, the grounds well kept, and the pool area was very nice. As mentioned many times, the beach has been eroded by the storms from a few years ago but they still had a beach entrance which is nice and there were plenty of chairs and sandy terraces with chairs for sunbathing. I wasn't as happy with the food. I have traveled a fair amount (Germany, France, England, Ireland, Jamaica, Hawaii, Curacao, etc) but have only been two one all inclusive resort (Beaches in Jamaica) and one cruise where the food was included. I thought the food at the reef playacar was edible but I felt that it was sub par. I'm not a picky eater and my daughter and I found things to eat each night but they weren't what I would call enjoyable meals. The room was clean and the bathrooms nice. I personally thought the beds were very comfortable, although I sleep on a hard bed at home and prefer that over soft beds. The room smelled like mildew but that is expected in a warm climate. I didn't think this was a good place to bring children. The pool was nice and they do have a kids club but my 7 year old son would have been bored at this resort and it would have been difficult to find things for him to eat since he is a picky eater. My 16 year old daughter commented that everyone was older and just wanted to sit around the pool or bar and drink. This is great for couples or groups of people (and expected on vacations) but it's not the best for small children. If I go back with my son we would probably pick a larger family resort. The location was excellent as we could walk to town. It was a healthy walk and we felt safe enough walking in for shopping or dinner, etc. We visited Xcaret one day and I highly recommend it. You can set up a trip with one of the hotel tour groups. We spent the whole day there. I don't think there is anything in the U.S. that compares. It had underground caves and rivers that you can snorkel in, a butterfly farm, various animals including monkeys and jaguars, an aquarium with sea turtles in various stages of life, swimming with the dolphins, beautiful coves and inlets for sun bathing, nice restaurants and a wonderful show in the evening that depicted the history of Mexico. There was a lot of shade and places to relax . Which were nice after walking around to see the sights. There were a lot of nice touches throughout the park including an exhibit that contained more than a hundred small birds hatching. My duaghter was absorbed in everything that she saw.

Those who have commented differently need to travel more extensively and stay longer that \"2 days\". My family travels a fair bit and to a variety of different places and I believe that if you are going to a Resort in a country outside of \"your own\" you must expect some differences. No, not everyone spoke English. That is why we went there. If you were treated rudely, maybe consider the way you approach them. We were a family of three, traveling with another couple and our experience with this Resort was terrific. The majority of staff were fabulous and I say this without hesitation. Rene, Cristian, Oliver.....many, many more....made every effort to make our stay memorable. They do this after 10+ hours per day, six days a week. Need I say more. The food for the most part was very good and plentiful. We happen to be somewhat picky as to the standard of food and really aside from a few things, this Resort provides a good variety and decent quality. If something did not agree with \"your tastes\", there was always plenty of other things to choose from. The snack bar is quick and handy if you don't feel like doing the Buffet. The wings, ribs and rotissiere Chicken were all great. It's a snack bar. They also serve great coffee AND ice cream at the snack bar.....so there is no reason to be without either....you just have to \"look\" a little harder. The Rooms are VERY clean and although many complain about the beds, the beds really are not that bad. They are firm, but not hard as concrete as has been mentioned. The entertainment....we only went to a few things, and they were all very good. The bars are fine too. If you don't first get what you were expecting, ask them for what you are looking for and they will do their best to accomodate. The downstairs lobby bar carries many of the International Brands we are all use to and there is no shortage......we tried (lol). But be adventurous....they make some fun domestic drinks too. Overall, this Resort really is great. It is not too big, but offering much of what the other bigger resorts would. It is small enough that they recognize you and remember the little things that you prefer. The Beach, unfortunately, is not hugh, but that is out of their hands and they work hard daily to ensure that they maintain what is left. You definately can access the water with little or no worry of rocks, unlike the Riu Palace next door that does have a sandy beach for your lawnchair and absolutely no access to the water. Choices. This was our second trip to this Resort. We are somewhat picky and our expectations are met at this Resort. We would come again for sure. Our friends that traveled together with us had a great experience as well and would return.

Believing that the hotel web site beach photos were true, my girlfriend & I booked a last minute vacation to The Reef Playacar. We were on vacation from Jan 6 -13, 2007. When we arrived: The Reef beach was approx 5 feet wide (nothing close to the wide pristine beach photographs on their web site). The day we left, the beach was completely gone and the lower terrace that we sunbathed on the day before, was closed due to dangerous sink holes caused by beach erosion. From what i witnessed, i can guess by now the lower terrace has collapsed into the sea. BEWARE: The all-inclusive activities: \"Nonmotorized water sports including sailboats, kayaks, windsurfing, boogie boards and snorkel equipment\" were NOT available because the beach is gone! NO Beach = No Beach Water Activities! Our room was clean and ok, but the Beds & Pillows were hard as a brick. Thankfully we travel with an Aerobed! Compared to our past Caribbean vacations, the overall service in The Reef was lacking! Unless one flashes US dollar tips, don't expect much/any service from food waiters or bar staff. Although costly, our frequent $ tips aquired service that other people around the pool & buffet envied. We enjoyed our vacation, because we met a few others who were willing to make the best of it... THANK YOU Windsor Canada, eh! & Suzy from Great Britain! And Kimberly, hope all is well! This resort is small and low key, geared towards family & kids or older folks. Anyone in between looking for a fun filled vaca... AVOID The Reef, Playacar! PS - on Rainy days there are ZERO activities, and the pool/beach bars (although empty) are kept open. While the other bars in the resort were fully occupied by visitors, the management refused to open service.

The first day, we were given one towel between us until we asked for another. It was the same for wash rags. Must be a shortage of clean towels in Playa. The water in the hot tub was simply not warm. It was a lukewarm which in the evening, with the ocean breeze, seemed rather cool. The pool was not heat regulated so it was very cold to us, since the weather was not that hot. The food was ok, but we got tired of the same stuff after a while. There was very little variation in what was presented. The Mexican restaurant was good. The drinks were average and the liquor was watered down unless it was tequila. The staff at the bars were not that friendly nor did they seem that interested in serving.

Thus, this report may be tempered by prior experiences at the Riu Cancun and Maya hotels with their suberb beaches. I rate those Riu - as 5 star establishments Our desire was to lay on a protected beech and have kids programs available, escellent food and entertainment. The Playacar had good food but often we had to clean off tables to get a place to sit. Staff just didn't clean things up, and left dirty tables and us waiting. The room door had an open space between the top door frame and the top of the door through which one could hear noise from the outside. The beech was terrible. Its only ocean access had a wall through most of the middle where some could lay on beech chairs if it were reserved early enough, but was not helpful for ocean access with ski-do's roaring on the south side and the sun area on the other. We had been accustomed to superior kid play and superrvised programs offered by the Cancun Riu's where their stage presentations were very well done. By contrast the Playa Reef was so-so.The year end play was OK but hotel guests were seated wwy off to the sides where reliatives and non guests got all the Center seats. Also there was way way too many mosquetos and we had bites. In the U.S. we have control spray treatment which keeps these pests at bay and was not fun to have to keep covered - We simply never have had these pests in 3 prior Cancun vacatopms/ We also did not like the roaches which were in trash cans and occasional running across floors. Roaches are common in some Hotels like the Krystal, and at this one - but I've never seen one at the two Cancun Riu properties. Hotel staff were good. My husband called daily and reported that at times he got no answer - but when the hotel did answer, his call was transferred quickly and professionally.

I have read a lot of exaggerated reviews and have tried my best to keep my review as objective as possible so that people can get a fair picture of what this hotel is all about. Arrival: We arrived at the Reef late in the afternoon on December 18, and check-in was a breeze. The hotel's reception/lobby area is tastefully decorated and open, with a nice lobby bar open in the evenings. (Try Humberto's mojito and the Xabentun -a Mayan liquor made from honey). There is wireless internet available in the lobby area to those who bring their laptops (and safes in the rooms to safely store them for 10 dollars a day). However, our laptop has a 12.1\" screen and it fit on its side inside the safe. Anything much bigger than probably 13.3\" is not likely to fit in the safe. But don't worry; there is also a 'business center' off the lobby with stationary computers to use for a fee. So if you don\u2019t need your lap top, don\u2019t bring it. An unlimited 7 day access card for laptops cost us 300 pesos (approx. 30 dollars) and if you're lucky, you can get connection in your room, although it may be weak. Although we had asked for a king room, there were none available since they were fully-booked. The staff did their best to find us the best possible king room, but that would mean we had to move to a room without an ocean view, so we opted out. The grounds and rooms: The hotel is situated in between private property to the north and the Riu to the south. If you're booking a trip to this hotel and the photo of the hotel shows jungle on either side of the Reef (and more importantly, a beach \u2013see the paragraph on the beach), you should be aware that that is no longer the case. Playacar is in the midst of a construction boom, and there are buildings being erected everywhere. Don't be worried, though--- there is no construction going on within hearing distance from the Reef. We loved the layout of the hotel--- small villas, each with 11 or 12 rooms over 3 floors, and a jungle in the middle of the complex. (Very beautiful). We stayed in a room in building 10, a queen/queen with an ocean view, in the complex closest to the ocean and pool areas. If you're looking for a quieter room, ask for one near the jungle, as we could hear much of the noise from the pool area. Bring earplugs if you are a light sleeper as doors and walls are paper-thin. Of course, there were certain things we didn't like about our room. It wouldn't have hurt if the beds were softer, and our toilet didn't require a 5 hour repair on day 6, but we tried to remember, we were in Mexico. (Most public Mexican stores/restaurants ask that you not flush paper down the toilet, as the plumbing is a bit weak, so be grateful that the Reef allows you to do so, and be aware that it is a privilege!). Our air conditioner worked perfectly, but the thermostat did not. We found that if we left it on during the day, and turned it off at night, we were fine. The overhead fan is enough at night. If we left the AC on all night, we\u2019d get too cold. Some would say the rooms are \"tackily\" decorated, but I would say they had Mexican flare. NOTE: Watch out for the tile floors when they're wet though, as they can be VERY slippery (as is the wooden walkway/bridge between the lobby and the rest of the hotel grounds, so hold onto the railing when crossing). The food: The food at the Reef was what we expected it to be for an all-inclusive. Remember that you are eating food that is cooked for average tastes, even though nearly everything is made-to-order while you watch the chef cook it. That means that if you like things spicy or salty, you'll have to add it when you go back to your table. The service was a bit inconsistent, but do not hesitate stop any of the waiters to ask for what you need. They were all very helpful when asked. Do be aware that English is a second language for nearly all of them. The hotel\u2019s snack bar was a great substitute for lunch, as my husband and I ended up eating most of our lunches poolside with a drink in hand. The bartenders kept the drinks coming, and were very good at that! There are two ala carte restaurants that are worth trying that are included in the all-inclusive rate, but you have to pre-book your reservation on the morning of the day you want to eat there. The reservation book is at the entrance of the main buffet building, and they start taking reservations at 10 am. The line forms fast, so be on time if you have a large group. The beach: I would be repeating what everyone else has already said by saying there is no beach at the Reef. It is true, though. But it is a problem that many Playacar and Playa del Carmen resorts are facing. It is not unique to the Reef. That said, swimming was still an option, (although not incredibly enjoyable) because they have two small beach-entry points left. Bring water shoes though, if you want to swim at the hotel, since the sand gets sharper as you walk in. All is not lost, though, as there are nice beaches in Playa del Carmen (a five minute taxi ride away), and an EXCELLENT beach at Tulum (make it a day trip!). We did not let the lack of a beach get to us, though, since there are many daily pool activities (volleyball and water polo in the lower pool, and even scuba diving in the upper pool). There is also the pool bar. Enough said. :) Since there is no beach, the competition for the beach chairs is stiff. If you want the beach chair of your choice, set your alarm clock for 7 am and get out there with your blue Reef beach towels to reserve them. Then go back to bed. Of course, on day one, you won\u2019t have you blue beach towel yet, so you\u2019ll have to reserve your pick with a book or a magazine. You can get the towels by the desk by the lower pool, next to the jacuzzi at 8:30 am (take two for each person and keep the extra dry ones in your hotel room, as it may rain on your other towels). Overall experience: Whether you will like the Reef or not depends almost entirely on what you expect your Riviera Mayan vacation to be. My husband and I are 29 and 27 years old, and wanted a laid-back hotel where we could truly unwind and forget what day it was. We wanted to be able to meet people on day one and then be able to see those familiar faces again on day two or four, for example. The smaller size of the Reef enabled that. We preferred the Reef to the Riu for example, because it offered a more personal experience, on a smaller scale. (The Riu is HUGE!!!!) The Riu is really a \"concrete jungle,\" as we heard fellow Reef patrons say. The difference between the Reef and the Riu can only be truly appreciated by those who can see these two entirely different hotels side-by-side. The Reef was much quainter. The grounds were absolutely beautiful and impeccably kept. There are hibiscus plants everywhere and amazing jungle vegetation. After every rain shower, there would be a guy out there with a broom, sweeping off the walkways, or cleaning up what is left of the beach. For the price, I would say that the Reef was not bad. The Riu next door has a much steeper rate, and I don\u2019t think that their guests were that much happier than us over at the Reef. Other outings and day trips worth the effort: Playacar is a very nice (and exclusive) area. It is loaded with other all-inclusives, and lots of private beach property (a lot of it for sale!). If you go left outside of the hotel, there is a small shopping area about a five minute walk away, called Plaza Playacar. They have lots of small shops and a drug store. If you want more action, go into Playa del Carmen, either by walking or by taxi (5 dollars). Ask for 5th Avenue and you\u2019ll be in tourist city! Lots of great stores and restaurants, but lots of people selling the same stuff over and over again. Try some places off-5th too, since you can often find better deals there. As far as day-trips are concerned, we wholeheartedly recommend the Tulum and Xel-Ha trips. Tulum is an archeological site with one heck of a beach (we heard it is one of the top-ten in the world), and Xel-Ha is a snorkeling paradise (\u201cnatural aquarium\u201d). We did both trips on the same day on a dual-trip with all-inclusive meals and drinks, and it was worth it. If we were to do it again, we would do each separately and go for an all-day Xel-Ha trip, since the park is in a lagoon area, there were no big waves to navigate. There is so much to see there.", "Date": "January 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Mexico", "Title": "\u201cChristmas at the Reef 12/18-12/27\u201d", "Author": "miamezcua", "ReviewID": "UR6543070", "Content": "I was amazed about the reviews that I read.

The hotel is not far at all from Playa del Carmen. It just takes 15 min. on foot or a $5 taxi ride. The only disappointment was the size of the beach. It is quite small. During our stay (Nov.13-Nov. 20th) the water was quite rough anyway, so we spent most of our time in the pool and doing excursions. We did a day trip to Chichen Itza but didn't book it through the hotel. It was much cheaper booking through one of the agents you can find downtown. The name of the travel agent is Segio's tours. We got a great deal and saw a lot that day. Be prepared to spend a long, hot day sight-seeing and wear comfortable shoes. Tulum was a short bus ride away. We didn't book a tour, but just took the local bus from the bus station downtown Playacar. There's a ferry boat to Cozumel which is also a lovely day trip. We rented a car once we got to Cozumel and drove to the beaches on the other side of the island. The beaches were BEAUTIFUL! Downtown Playa recommendations: if you want to go salsa dancing, try Mambo Cafe. On 5th Avenue downtown Playa you can find lots of great restaurants. We ate amazing steak and seafood cocktails at Mare y Tierra and checked out the Blue Parrot night club on the beach. It's ladies night on Thursdays! Free drinks for women but VERY expensive drinks for men. Atmosphere is cool though. The food stands downtown selling 'fast food' such as tacos and sandwiches are delicious.

For the most part we were very happy with our stay at the Reef Playacar. Our family, early 30's with two kids 7 & 3, found the resort to be very relaxing and a great value. At first we were a little leery because there is not a grand lobby or reception area and the first impression is not that impressive. However, the more time we spent there the more we appreciated the secluded feel of the rain forest courtyard and the cottage style rooms. Each cottage has four rooms on each of the three floors, so there were no loud drunks stumbling to their rooms at 3 a.m., or at least that we had to hear. Also, who wants to be around 400 rooms of people like at the larger resorts? The service was also good with the exception of the lady running the grill by the pool. She didn't always act very happy to serve. I would say as a whole the staff did not understand or speak English as well as in Cancun, as other reviews had mentioned. We didn't have a problem with this and communicated just fine. I don't understand why some people complained about this, after all we are in their country, however, I am sure our 20 word Spanish vocabulary was impressive to them. The food exceeded our expectations. The buffet always had a good variety of entrees, fresh fruit, and bread. The nightly, reservation only restaurants were great. I recommend the grilled salmon at Botticelli's. It is the best! But reserve early as they fill up quickly starting at 10 a.m. daily for that night. There were only a couple of negative things we experienced with this resort. The main thing, and it was big, is that the beach is pretty much nonexistent at this resort. If you are also looking at the Riu Palace beware. It is right beside the Reef and its beach is primarily rock. It is not just the beach here. Other resorts are having similar problems. The positive note was that the Reef is only about a 10 minute walk (15 holding a 3 yr old) to the 5th Ave district where there is a good public beach by shopping and the ferry to Cozumel. We love the ocean and the beach so we did this each day we were there. A taxi ride is only $5 one way, but it is a nice walk. Walking back and forth to eat at the hotel does become an inconvenience. The only other negative was since there is no beach, wake up early as the lounge chairs by the pool get \"reserved\" with towels and other personal belongings by 7:30. We have always stayed in Cancun, without the kids, but found Playa's laid back pace more welcoming with the entire family. We would have no problem staying at the Reef again except we love hanging out at the beach and they simply don't have one. One of the locals said that since the Tsunami the ocean has risen about 1 meter each of the last two years consuming about 75-100 meters of beach. If you see a picture of this resort with large beaches, trust me the picture must be older than two years ago. Know this going in or you will be very upset and dissappointed when you arrive. We love this area of the world and wish we were still there. I am a type A CPA and this is one of the few places that I can go and do a 180 degree turn and completely relax.

We got quite a shock, however, Saturday morning when we went out and discovered that overnight over half of the remaining beach had disappeared, just like that! The main concrete steps down undermined and broke up, seperating from the main retaining wall and crumbling in a heap. One of the thatched roof beach shelters crashed down right beside us as we sat on the beach as the waves took out the sand supporting it.

When the restaurant wasn't open, you could always find something else to eat- snack bar, ice cream, bar area. We aren't big drinkers, but the ones we had were good- not too much alcohol to dilute the flavor. We ate dinner at the Italian restaurant which was excellent. The Reef is the closest Playacar hotel to Playa. It is an easy 10-12 minute walk, which we took several times. The beach isn't very big, drops off fairly quickly, and tended to be rocky along the breakwater, but that didn't stop us from enjoying it. What we liked best were the gardens, which are exquisite!, the constant attention to cleanliness, and the pre-Hispanic show of Mayan dance, which was as good as some we have seen done professionally. If the show is offered when you are there, be sure to see it ! ! ! ! Would we stay there again ? Yes.

So, while one is swimming, large scuba boats with roaring engines pull in an out less than 20 meters away from where you are swimming and fill the area up with 2 stroke exhaust fumes. There is no other area to swim. The reef is at the end of a washed out strip of beach and all the resorts have limited water access, but the reef has the least.

The grounds alone set it apart. I have yet to find a photo on the internet that does justice to the beautiful inner courtyard of this hotel. Its like a well manicured piece of the jungle (beautifully lit at night). Despite the fact that one of the al a carte restaurants were closed while we were there, I never tired of the food, as there was a different theme in the Buffet restaurant evey night. The selection even then was vast enough to leave me feeling that I just hadn't experienced all there was to offer. Boticelli's was as exquisite a fine dining experience as one could ask for. The service as excellent as the food (I'm unsure how they managed to serve melt-in-your mouth fresh Atlantic Salmon in the Carribean). I rarely had difficulty making myself understood by staff members, though I don't speak Spanish. And they never made an issue of it (though an American tourist quite haughtily told me she'd never dream of coming to Mexico without knowing the language). I could, however, speak it quite fluently after 4 shots of tequila. And - speaking of tequila, the drinks were strong and plentiful. The Mexican staff encourage you to have a great time, but don't worry, thier security people aren't about to let you drown yourself skinny dipping in the wee hours of the morning. That being said, there were few singles at this resort. Mostly small families and couples. The Europeans vastly outnumbered the colonials, and there wasn't a lot of revelry at the resort itself. There were a number of clubs in Playa del Carmen that played horrible techno trash music and served watered down drinks. The Blue Parrot being the worst of them (as they had 2 DJ's playing different songs at the same time from opposite ends of the bar) Pure cacaphony. Thier $6.00 USD Margaritas tasted like 7/11 slushies and thier Cuba Libres were nothing more than diet Coke. Senior Frog's was a little better, I was especially amused by thier method of clearing the bar after last call - just turn the fire extinguisher on the crowd and let them have it. The Mayan ruins were breathtaking - especially Coba, which boasts the Yucatan's tallest pyramid - still accessable to those who want to climb them and see the jungle canopy from the top. My suggestion is to go in the late afternoon when the sun is low and shining on the face of the pyramid. A sight I won't soon forget. The last 20k of road to Coba is under construction and no fun to drive in the dark.

It was absolutely awesome. The room was decorated up with flowers on our arrival and we had the most awesome honeymoon. So much to see and do in this area of Mexico. We returned again in September of 2004 for another 10 days at The Reef Playa Car. The resort and the beaches were awesome as usual and what is exceptionally nice about this resort is that it's smaller so it offers you more of a quaint ambiance rather than the hustle and bustle of a larger resort. And they retain their help. We saw alot of the same faces that we saw when we were there for our honeymoon in 2003 and some even remembered us................now that's really a nice feeling. We had planned to go again in 2004 but two days before we were to fly to Mexico, Hurricane Wilma hit and dashed our plans. We ended up in the Dominican Republic which was nice but not as lively as Mexico. We returned for our Third stay at the Reef Playa Car from October 28th thru November 8th (12 days). The resort has done some renovating and has added a wonderful new ice cream parlor which serves the most delicious Carmel & Cream Ice Cream....delicious!!! If you go there, try it as you'll never taste anything like it in the USA. They also added a lounge/lobby bar which offers some upscale drinks like martinis and others. They also upgraded their Snack Bar whick offers a variety of fast food items, pizza, hot dogs, hamburgers, nachos, chicken etc... This is nice but you have to wait and the line can be long at times. It use to be Self Serve and I liked that much better. Perhaps they could make Nachos and some of the lighter items self serve, it would be more convenient. Often times we ate at chula vista for lunch as it was buffet style and you didn't have to wait. We had several meals in Borticelli's (upstairs at the Reef Playa Car). It's an excellent Italian Restaurant and the food is out of this world. Don't miss this gem!!!! Our Room was lovely and was always cleaned promptly in the morning by the same friendly gal. We were in room 833 and it was the perfect location for the pool, restaurants etc........Not one complaint on that. We saw many familiar faces, alot of the staff from 2003 was still there which goes to show that it's a nice place to work. The staff is awesome,,,,friendly, knowledgeable about the area and very helpful. I want to mention a few of the staff that really shine and deserve to be mentioned, \"Herman\" who always had a smile on his face and went above and beyond to deliver drinks to us at our lounge chair and to offer any assistance he could during our stay. Pedro from the pool bar who suggested so many delicious drinks \"riveria maya\", \"Monaco\", \"mojito\" and \"Louis\" who has worked his way up to be a supervisor. These folks helped to make our stay so enjoyable. The only drawback about going in Oct/Nov is that it's the rainy season and we had an awful lot of rain which was very disappointing to us as we're real \"beach people\". I wouldn't go in November again as it's their rainy season. I have been there in June/July and Aug/Sept and it was sunny all the time...........this time it was more rain than sun. so if thinking of going to the Reef Playa Car try to plan your tirp when it's not their rainy season. I also was disappinted with the beach this time. In the past we saw a gorgeous, pristine white, powdered sugar beach that was very expansive. With Hurricane Wilma and other tropical storms the beach has basically been washed away. The beach area is now quite rocky and the surf is rather rough due to erosion. The best swimming area is where the boat launches and we had an issue with the Marina guy as he wouldn't allow anyone to swim in that area even when the boats were out for hours on end. Personally I feel that is unfair to the guests who so badly want to enjoy the Caribbean Sea. Something needs to be done about the beach as there just isn't one anymore and it really shouldn't be an issue for \"guests\" to swim in the boat launch area when the boats our out on scuba expeditions. We were put out about that as the BEST swimming area is where the boats launch. I would definately go back to The Reef Playa Car as the resort itself is absolutely Wonderful. The food is delicious, the shows and entertainment are great and the staff is awesome. My only complaint is the Beach as right now there really isn't one. Hopefully they'll be able to bring in sand and build the beach up to what it use to be...in one word, it use to be AWESOME but the hurricane can really do a number on the shoreline.

First I went completely alone, flew to Cancun and took the ADO bus to Playa del Carmen. it only cost me $8.00 . When I got there I took a taxi to the hotel. ( $5.00). Check in was easy and I stayed on a room facing the beautiful tropical garden, just what I wanted. The first 3 days I tried to keep myself busy and went to Cozumel ( a little disappointing) next day I took a trip to Chichen Itza, don't buy this trip online or unfortunately at the Hotel, they will rip you off, I went to Playa del Carmen and started shopping around, I found first for 89usd then 69usd then 59usd and finally for only $45.00 !!!! They picked me up at the hotel at 7:30am, went straight to Chichen Itza with a stop to the restroom and shopping. All the other tours I preferred to go to Playa, much better and the service is the same all over! The hotel is gay friendly, I saw several couples, guys and girls but I was little lost on where to go, not so sure if I should ask the guy at the front desk I decided to check the internet! I strongly recommend you to go first to WannaBanna on the 5 Avenue in between 30and 32 street, its was great, Mario the owner told me about the other two clubs to go afterwards, I made friends with the nicest people ever.... Vega is right on 10 street, where you see the light house, awesome club, very trendy and spacious, great ambience very Playa. The other club is called Playa 69.... there you find the more daring locals, flirting is in your face and they're not shy, tequila shots is mandatory!!! Club 69 is on 5th Avenue in between 6 and 8 streets, going north bound, pay attention to your left, the sign is kinda hidden and the club entrance is located almost inside and gallery. The shows at the Reef were quite nice, Monday night they have 70's night, it was they gayest show I've seen in a hotel ever!!! I guess they don't know YMCA is quite gay! it was fun anyways, the guy from Congo was hilarious, they all did a great job. Saturday night they had Mexican night, it was simply beautiful, their folklore is just one of the most colorful and beautiful there is. They were professionals dancers and it was as cute as it can be, don't miss it. The staff is extremely helpful although they seemed to be short staffed, Neri was a gentlemen, he recognized me every day, all the others knew me and complimented me often. Pedro from the pool bar was great, I speak French but he understood the French guest better than I did and he only speaks Spanish and limited English. Just to remind all American guests! it's not that they don't speak English, it's you that don't speak Spanish! Advice: Take some Spanish lessons before going there and just relax, you;re in Mexico... The staff is very nice and ready to help, they deserve to be respected on their own country, LEARN SPANISH PEOPLE! YOU'RE NOT THE STATES!!!! The hotel had a very international staff as well, Italians, French, Dutch ( cute girl), Venezuelan one guy from Chile ( silly boy! hehehe) and off course Mexicans, the girl with long hair was a great hostess, thank you, sorry didn't get your name. The majority of the guests were from Europe a very few Americans and Canadians. Being single wasn't very easy to approach people, still I made a bunch of friends in Playa. Go to Xcaret the show at night is simply one of the most touching and interesting events and it can never be missed by any visitor, also a must. My stay was perfect, the housekeepers were great, they knew what time I left the room and never bothered me once, I always found my room clean and nice. Since I was alone I never went to Boticelli, I ate at the buffet almost all the time, it was hit on Mexican night and a miss on a night I can't think of.... overall the breakfast was good, the fruits were delicious, the crab salad was amazing! I loved most of it, grilled fish, calamari, shrimp, some dark salsa they used on seafood was DELICIOUS! I was open to new tastes and tried it all, never got sick. In Playa del Carmen (PDC) you can eat at the finest restaurants , amazingly there are several fine dinning, Casa Del Agua was simply exquisite, if you feel like going to where the locals go, check 10 Avenue, there you find the most cheap restaurants and they're very good. Plaza Pelicanos has the best natural food I've tried in my whole life, try their exotic natural juice drinks, they're amazing and you will never find that in any part of the world. Going to Playa del Carmen is for those who are looking for peace, fun, relaxation, adventure and much more.( you can even fall in love, just like me), Playa has an atmosphere that you'll never find any place else. I loved it and I WILL BE BACK FOR MORE!!! Mexico certainly exceeded my expectations, I could not stop crying the day I left, I did not want to leave Mexico, they changed my life, they purified my soul and made me realize that there are places and people in this world worth to see and experience. The Mexicans in PDC were the best, they really make you feel like you belong there, they treat you with a smile and if you speak the language it will be an unforgettable experience.

It was a family vacation with my wife and two children. The resort is clean and the rooms are comfortable, though a bit small. The AC can be a bit loud but overall, the facilities are quite nice. The staff is very friendly and the service was fantastic. We ate at the buffet 70% of the time and made reservations at the Mexico restaurant for dinner three days. I would say the breakfast and lunch buffets are better than the dinner. The reservation-required mexican restaurant was quite good and I highly recommend it. There were quite a few guests that smoked and this did bother us during meal time as there is no smoking zone in the buffet restaurant. The snack bar had its usual (and fatty) goodies such as burgers, fries, pizzas, etc. The pool was fine and the beach area is small but pleasant. My kids loved the boggie boards to ride on the ocean waves. We did not attend any of the evening shows. As for activities, we did quite a bit. We booked the snorkeling trip with the Reef (Laura is quite helpful at booking trips) and found it enjoyable. We also went to Isla Mujeres and did some snorkeling off this island as well. My kids swam with the dolphins and they found it exciting while I found the place to be a bit too commercia. The last and best activity was the \"Tulum Extreme\". The \"extreme\" is for \"extremely fun\" . It is not dangerous and my 10 year old had no problems with any of the adventures. We thoroughly enjoyes snorkeing in a cave, zip-lining into water and learning about the history and culture of City of Tulum.

We loved it, we had a wonderful time. This was our first experience with an all-inclusive resort and for the money we spent, we could not have gotten any better. -After landing we checked in with our travel rep and waited about five minutes before we loaded into the van and headed down to Playa del Carmen. The driver even asked if we wanted to stop at 7-11 for a drink for the trip. The drive down only took about 35-40 min. which was not bad at all. -When we arrived in Playacar, it is this gated community with a bunch of residences and vacation homes (all very nice looking), we drove down a nicely paved street with side walks for walking into town. Our resort was the first resort on the strip, then numerous other resorts continued on down the road. This was great because our resort was the closest in walking distance to the town (we rented bikes once and walked into town a few times). -At our resort we checked in (it was very simple and quick) and then we were on our way. We went to our room which was located in the middle of the resort and checked it out, it was very clean and nice and cold (we had fun with the a/c, but all you really need is the fan and you can turn the a/c on occasionally if you are sweating). The grounds were just as nice as everyone has said they would be, very well kept, there were people working on them everyday. -Then we went to the buffet for lunch, it was definitely not the greatest lunch but they did have some good things like, quesadillas, fresh guacamole and salsa, and my husband got good pesto ravioli, but after that we pretty much just ate at the snack bar for lunch. The first night you will not be able to get reservations for the restaurants, but after that you can get them every night and we never had a problem cause we were normally at breakfast when it was the time you can get on the list (which is 10am). Dinner at the restaurants was great (get ideas from other guests, we got the salmon, that was pretty good) especially when compared to the dinner buffet (which was not very good, not very many choices). Breakfast was very good (selections you would get from any breakfast buffet \u2013 omelets, French toast, pancakes, scrambled eggs, bacon or sausage, fruit, yogurt, cereal) breakfast quesadillas and other Mexican breakfast items. -The bars were great, always fast, and always friendly. The drinks were almost always strong, definitely try the mojitos they were very good, pina colodas, bahama mamas, all very good. Don\u2019t go for the frozen margaritas or daiquiris cause those were too watered down. -The beach was small but fun, there were however a lot of big rocks in the ocean so be careful, we tripped over a bunch of them. I found that you have to wake up at or before 7 to get a beach chair in the middle section of the beach (which was the best area, because of the ocean breezes and this area has the most shade and it is away form the loud speaker that is by the lower pool) but really there are tons of open spots that are covered and beautiful and there seemed to always be spots up and around the pools. -Tulum, we rented a car for one day and drove it down to Tulum. A few issues: We rented it from Alamo which was only $16 dollars but we had to buy liability which brought it to $24. (The only problem with renting it from them is that they said in the agreement that they would only authorize $1000 but instead they authorized $4000, which is fine but it has been 5 days and the money has still not come off hold from our card so we are getting upset, so be careful) But anyway, they gave it to us with \u00bc tank of gas which would not get us very far so we went to the gas station, we figured they would take credit but they did not (or at least that is what they said) so we had to pay for the gas in cash which pretty much wiped us clean out of cash. So anyway, we made it to tulum and you need to pay $4 to park there and $4.50 a person and then $2 if you want to take the train thing or you can just walk (add it is not that far), the money was a little had for us since we were wiped out of our cash, but we figured it out. But I would have to say it was worth it, it was beautiful. They don\u2019t let you on to the ruins which really upset me but I understand, although the pictures on postcards have people all over them so they must have changed it recently. There is a nice place to go down and jump into the ocean and the breezes are very nice when you are out on a hot day. Defiantly go to Tulum, I also heard Xel-ha was a lot of fun but we did not get a chance this trip. -The catamarans were a lot of fun and I think defiantly worth it to get out into the water and look up and down the beach. -We both got a massage on the beach and it was awesome. We made reservations (which we did not really need to cause no one else really seemed to be doing it) and they gave us a free five minutes which was really more like 15 and it was a great warm up of what to expect. Then we got our massage on the last day we were there right on the beach, we were side by side getting a wonderful 30 min massage which really lasted 45 min and just enjoyed the ocean breezes, it was so tranquil and they really did a great job. -We brought all in all like 30 dollars in ones and we gave them out here and there as tips, like to the bartenders and servers for a few of our meals, the bell boy, the driver, the rep at the airport, and so on, and I think it is something you don\u2019t have to do, but I think it is good to help them out a little especially when they make so little but work so hard.

AMAZING. they take reservations at about 9:50am (they say 10) and they do fill up quickly. only about 7 slots are filled for the hour time slots starting at 6:30 and ending at 9:30. we got the last time slot at 9:30 one night and i wasn't sure if it was worth eating so late but it is. the clam and crab meat appetizer is superb. we also ate at the italian restaurant and it was so-so. better than the buffet restauarant but was a little disappointed since we enjoyed the mexican restuarant so much. when we went, the italalian and mexican restuarants weren't both opened at the same time - the restuarants alternated - mexican open on tues, italian on wed, mexican on thurs, etc. as for the buffet, it was alright. breakfast - make your own omelet, crepes, french toast, pancakes, fresh fruit drinks and/or smoothie, cereal, fruit, asst of breads. lunch and dinner, they alternated diff foods and had lots of desserts to finish it off. it was somewhat of a hit or miss. snack bar was good too - pizzas, ribs (mmmm), fries, waffle fries, sandwiches, burgers, hotdogs, ice cream, etc. make sure you make it to the ice cream parlor (they have more flavors than the snack bar had and are open from 4-6 i think) and get chocolate chip - best my bf and i ever had. beach/pool... beach is small but never had a problem finding chairs. beach is where the europeans hung out (many of the women were topless) and the poolside were also filled with ppl but never had a problem with chairs as well. yes, swim up bar was always crowded but never had a problem getting drinks. owh - they make killer frozen drinks - pina coladas, \"miami vice\", bahama mamas, mmmmmm....couldn't get enough shows at night: we saw 70's night and it was pretty corny. casino night wasn't even casino night - more like kiddy casino night because money wasn't real and all the casino things were toy like...if you are bored, then go see the shows but my suggestion is that you do other nightly things elsewhere... staff of hotel... ALWAYS ALWAYS so polite and kind. they work really hard to serve and please you. i noticed almost everyone didn't tip the staff but they get paid so little that i found it nice to give them a dollar here and there. one guy, was there till about 11 (when i left the buffet - he was still there cleaning and was probably there till later) and then i saw him in the next morning at 8 busting his butt. when i went to get a soda and water at the bar, he insisted i sit and that he'd bring it to me. i kept saying no, that i was able to do it, that he didn't have to, but still, he insisted further, that he would do it. at many of the bars, you can see the waiters are working quickly to get what you want and it's obvious that they aren't expecting a tip. they have amazing work ethics. all in all - the hotel and experience was great. don't expect a five star hotel but it's definately worth your money to stay here. i loved my experience here. owh! if you go to playa del carmen, make sure you do the tulum xtreme trip. you zipline in a jungle and into a cenote (cave) with water. you snorkel inside the cenote and then have lunch (the best lunch ever!). last, you experience the tulum ruins and for about 30 minutes, you can swim on their beach. best excursion!!! other excursions we did were xcaret (didn't really like it) and atv and speedboating (was alright [i had done it before] but boyfriend loved it [his first with both]). make sure you go shopping and walk along the 5th ave area at night. it's a 5 minute walk from the hotel and from what i was told from the locals, shopping at the intersections is cheaper than on 5th ave. always bargain bargain bargain - but pls note that the ppl there are very pushy... last but not least, use insect repellent - i got bit about 8 times and they still itch. if i ever visit playa del carmen again, i will def return here again. had a wonderful trip....", "Date": "August 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cOne week at the reef.

We're 24 and 25. We've done a lot of research on this site, and then shopped for prices. Ended up booking our trip through Funjet, and are happy we've done so. Day after arrival travel rep met with us to ensure everything is going good, and also to give us introdution into the area, and areas attractions, and their recommendations. We eneded up booking 2 days tips - Chichen Itza Mayan site, and the reef snorkeling just south of Cancun. Aeromexico flight/crew/in flight services are superb. Complimentary alcohol and lunch was a pleasant surprise. You will be solicited for timeshares, etc until you get outside the airport. We just kept walking. We arrived at 6 pm, checking in was quick and easy. Hotel staff was very nice. Luggage was carried for us. Hotel grounds are absolutely beautiful!!! It's desinged with a jungle theme in mind. While from the street resort looks old and unattractive, it's quite nice and beatuful on the inside! Other resorts nearby looked stunning, however grounds, beach, and amenities were quite poor (we've walked few of them, and also from speaking with other couples we've met). 1st night we got a room with 2 twins, and asked for a different room, and closer to the ocean. Next morning we've moved to king, much closer to the ocean. There was no charge, and it was quick and easy transition. ROOMS: Super clean!!!! Beds are very comfortable, and AC was freeeeeezing!! Water pressure was ok. Safe inside the room (ask for lock at the fron desk, don't loose the key either, $100 charge), and there was no extra charge. Mini-fridge in the room, with 2 bottles of water ($1 per). We brought our own water (like 16 small bottles) to drink while in the room, and excursions, and it was more than enough to last a week. Iron and mini ironing board in the room. Large tv and remote. Vanity with mirror. Balcony with 2 chairs and a table. 2 chairs and a table inside the room. End table on each side of the bed. Hairdryer in the bathroom. BEACH: Best part of the hotel. Reserve your seating earlier in the morning, by 10 am best spots were pretty much taken, but even then, it wouldn't take us long to find somewhere to lay! A lot of seating shaded, unlike many other resorts on the same strip. Beach was constantly cleaned for seaweed and cups left behind. It was pretty clean. FOOD: Main buffet was pretty good. Main entrees were rotated daily. Fresh fruits, vegetables, and freshly baked breads (quite a few varieties) were avail for b-fast, lunch and dinner. In the mornings, they had a juice bar - they would blend any tropical fruits with water/juices/yogurt of your liking to create yamee beverages. Omlets and eggs availiable to your liking in the morning. Reservations required for Italian and Mexcian restraunts. We went to both. Italian was great, until we got main entrees, we were disappoitnted with Alfredo. Smoked salmon on buffer at the Italian rest. Mexican was way better. Revervations started at 10 am. We were there 10 till and were the first ones to get in (they refused to take reservations prior to 10 am). Once we came in at 11 and they were full. Snak bar was the best - ice cream, french fries, waffle fries, chicken wings, baked chicken, bbq ribs, fajitas, brick oven baked pizzas to order, nachos, hot dogs, burgers, etc. Bars were great. BRING YOUR OWN BIG CUPS!!! We were the only ones to have them, and got a jelauos stare from EVERYONE!! Cups they give you are very small. Thermal would be good also. Shows were fun. There was daily activities in one of the two pools for kids and adults. Playa Del Carmen 15 minutes walking distance. We walked at night few times - super safe. Residential district. $5 cab to PDC. Charlos and Charlies great restraunt we went to - highly recommended. Walked south on the beach, about 30-45 minutes will get you to stunning beach and untouched and undeveloped land by the beach. It was worth it. Marina at the hotel was great, and Catamarans, kayaks and boogie boards were included. They will even teach you how to use cats in the wind. We enjoyed the reef. Staff is nice. Grounds are manicured. Bring big/thermal cups, $1 bills for tips, and underwater cameras (if you plan to go snorkeling, etc).

I couldn't wait to write my review on this resort since some of the reviews I read after we booked our vacation caused much apprehension about our choice of properties. What were you people thinking ? If you weren't happy with this place, then stay at the uppity, sterile Riu Palace next door ! There was nothing wrong with the Reef, it was a beautiful resort ! The tropical gardens throughout the resort are absolutely amazing, I am a big fan of Palm Trees and all things tropical, so this was my paradise found. I loved the mexican rustic feel of the grounds and the villas. The pools were not huge, but plenty space for spending the day and always chairs available anywhere you wanted to relax with a margarita ! Beach, beautiful tropical blue water and soft white sand. Neat canopy beds around pools and beach. Very elegant. The drinks, FABULOUS. Not one we didn't enjoy. Hats off to Santos, our fave bartender ! The buffet, not fancy, but very good food always. The snack bar food AMAZING and always available, long hours during the day and then again late night snacks- Guacamole and chips, yummy burgers and fries, wings, roasted chicken, brick oven pizzas made to order...what more can I say ! We ate from the snack bar for lunch every day by the pool instead of going into the buffet. Our kids loved the ice cream parlour as we enjoyed an afternoon cappucino ! The rooms, a little small, but impeccable and clean, clean, clean. Any easy access from anywhere as the size of the resort was not huge like the Riu's or Bahia Principes. WE loved it for that reason, so very comfortable right from the time we arrived. Staff, always friendly. Gotta love the Mexican people. Needless to say, Playa del Carmen (15 min walk from the resort to 5th Ave.) is our new favourite destination. 5th Avenue was so much fun and a night out at the Blue Parrot (go there if you love dancing on the beach !)

We took into consideration some of the things people before us mentioned on TripAdvisor...we were pleasantly surprised to find that we found almost no correlations between complaints others had, and our own stay. First off - know this...the resort IS small. There are maybe only a few hundred rooms and it's not very big. This was not a big deal to us. The lush greenery of the resort was gorgeous, and worth a daily walk through the grounds (even if it took only a few minutes!). Despite the size of the resort, we found the service to be superb. We were welcomed by Mike at the front desk, who did everything in his power to make our check in go smoothly. Pedro at the beach bar is an awesome guy. The waiters at the restaurants and the buffet were sooooo courteous and polite! The shows were a bit cheesy - but it is a small resort. The sport/entertainment club people were super nice and worked hard to make sure people were having a good time. Many people have commented on not being able to make reservations for the Mexican/Italian restaurants - we did not find this as a problem at all. The lady who took reservations while we were there for a week, was adament about waiting until 10 to start taking them. So - if you were around at 10 (or we even got reservations at 11:30 one day) you had no problem getting in. The exception that they do make, is if you take an excursion, and leave at 7:45 - they will let you make reservations early. We LOVED the Italian restaurant. The food there was incredible. My fiance loved the Mexican restaurant, too. For dessert, you must try the Italian Chocolate, or the Canoli's! The breakfast buffet was great. The lunch/dinner buffets were a little hit and miss. But not to worry...the snack bar has UNBELIEVABLE food! The snack bar even opens again at 10:30 at night, until 2 in the morning for any late night snackers. The beach is small - but we had no troubles ever getting chairs, or even palapas if we wanted it. Plan on getting up around 8 or 9 to reserve some seats, and you will be good to go. The pools were small, too - but again the resort itself it small, so we never felt terribly crowded b/c there weren't a ton of people staying there. Biggest disappointment we had, was that they don't have a minibar in the rooms. People have mentioned you have to pay for bottled water in your room, which I suppose is probably true since they don't give you any drinks in your room to begin with. We solved this small problem with buying a few bottles of water, and having the bartenders fill them up as we needed. We simply loved staying in Playacar, and will most certainly go back. You are only about a fifteen minute walk from Playa del Carmen, and only about a five minute walk from the plaza shops in Playacar. If you're not expecting the Four Seasons, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised with the friendliness of the staff, and their willingness to help you out.

We walked into town each day to shop and eat on Fifth Avenue. The pools are somewhat smaller, but we never had a problem finding pool chairs. After a late night out on the town, we were able to stumble into the pool area around 10 a.m. and we still found chairs. We really did not have a difficult time getting drinks at the swim-up bar. The bartenders are extremely busy at times, so while we were waiting for a drink we used the time to meet other guests. The Reef Playacar has a wonderful mix of guests from all over the world. The room was fine. Although our air conditioner made some odd noises when we first arrived, the maintenance staff arrived in five minutes to fix it. We had no complaints about the beds. We also took a $30 snorkeling trip with the hotel that was fantastic. We saw some beautiful coral and fish. Now for the bad part - we thought the food was pretty bad. Please take this with a grain of salt, as we might just be \"uppity city folk\" when it comes to food, but we thought the food quality was poor. We tried the buffet and the Italian restaurant, and everything was not very appetizing. Our best meals were at the snack bar. However, we found some great restaurants for dinner on Fifth Avenue - Ula Gula, Blue Parrot Hotel, and an Italian/Mediterranean wine bar on Tenth Avenue. Also, if you're looking for fun nightlife, look no further than the Blue Parrot Beach Club. It's a great time!

We were there for four days with another couple. I have to say, for the price of this hotel it really is AWESOME. The grounds are so well mantained and you feel you are in some kind of beautiful jungle with great vegetation. It is very clean. Check in was a breeze. We got there at 11am and our room was ready. So lets get started... Room: Large and comfy. Like another reader said, they are set up as bungalows and this gives it a great feel. The beds are a little hard but I actually got a great night sleep everynight.There is a fridge in the room that you can stock up with things you like. YES... you do have to pay for water. But for goodness sake, it is only a DOLLAR, actually it is 10 pesos which is the equivilant of 80-90 cents. If this causes a problem for some people then just go to the store and stock up on your own. You only have to pay for bottled water in your room. Dining: You have to make reservations for one of the restaurants at 8am. This really was not a problem for us since we were up and having breakfast at that time anyway. The food at the restaurants where you do make reservations is excellent! Try there beef filet, it is great. The buffet during breakfast and lunch was good, not the greatest but good enough. There is a snack bar that you can eat from as well. They have guacamole and quesadillas and what not. They are really great to have and munch by the pool. Overall: This resort was great.

There were always people cleaning and making sure everything looked nice. The beach is nice with a lot of lounge chairs to hang out on. The pool area was really nice too. We never had a problem getting a lounge chair at anytime of the day nor did we have a problem getting drinks. All in all, this resort was excellant. I don't understand why people complain.

Specially the ones in the private area of Playacar. So her is goes... I arrive at the Reef on June 26 and my departure was Yesterday or July 2, 2006 The place was very clean. We check in and got our luggage to our room in no time. then we decide to have something to eat the the Chula Vista Restaurant. The food was good no complaints and after we got some drinks we walk aroun the area to check out other places. I tought the room was kind of small but it was kept clean and was nice and cool. This was good becuase after walking in the heat then coming back ...you need a nice cool place to stay. I notice that the grounds were kept very clean and seems that the staff work extra hard. it's true...they seem under staff at times but it's not like you're at work and only have 30 minutes to eat anyway. You're in MExico....Relax...you're there to take it easy and not be rushing you know. anyway... Dinner reservation was not a problem. you have to get there at 8:00am to make the reservation. there is not a lot of room at both the italian restaurant (boticceli) and the mexican restaurant. It's very romantic. I book both times at 8:00am and had no problems. I play pool at the upstair bar and it was fun. Got some drinks took some pictures ..what some TV..they have some nice Flat HDTV Tv there. 3 actually sos there is plenty to do and see. You can walk down the street and will get to the Playacar Plaza were you will find lots of things to buy ...but we prefer to by at other places since they tend to be a big higher in prices sometimes. But still nice to check and see what they got. This is my third time in playa del carmen. and everytime..I learn something new. I got a rental car for only $35 a day...if you try this at your resort...probably will be twice that more maybe even more...that's why you have to go to the main street or 5th avenue on playa del carmen to get a good deal. You'll save a lot more and have a lot more fun exploring yourself without waiting for a taxi or bus or minivan to do tours and other places of interest. I found that the far away you are from the resort the better prices you get. a bottle of water cost you $2 dollar but if you go to a convenience store...you pay 70 cents. The Reef was very accodating to us. we never saw a timeshare salesperson there so maybe it's a timing thing with some people that have seem them there at the reef. Tip is not necessary but we did tip the bell hop and the cleaning lady. they sure appreciate you doing that since they only get $5 a day over there. which is about 61 pesos. not very much.... the Reef in my opinion was a good place to stay. don't be nick picking on everything. this is not a 6 star hotel but you will enjoy regarless becuase they try to make your stay as happy and enjoyable as possible. With that I hope you have a great time when you visit cancun. We sure did.

I was disappointed in our stay and would not recommend this place. This having been our fifth trip to Mexico, we had higher expectations. The resort itself was nice and the beach was nice. Making resturant reservations was an issue, but to overcome that, you just need to be there between 7-7:30am to make reservations. Both the Mexican and Italian resturants were good. The buffet did lack much variety and the service wasn't the best. The biggest problem we had was the staff at the front desk, which was rude. This is something we had not experienced in our previous vactaions to Mexico. It had always be the opposite. When the rooms were cleaned, they would continuously leave two towels, knowing that we had three people and that we had asked for additional towels. This became a joke with the front desk and I had to go to the desk and request additional towels daily. It got to the point that I didn't have to even give them our room number. When you check out, they will try to charge you for the bottled water, even if you didn't drink it. So, be aware of this when you check out and don't hesitate to tell them that you didn't use any of their water. They know you didn't use it, but they will try to squeeze a few extra pesos out of you. The one bright spot is Luis, who works in the dining area and resturants. Luis was great. If you do go to the Reef, be sure to meet Luis. Had this been my first time and had nothing to compare it to, I would think it was OK. However, that is not the case. This is definately not a 4 star resort, but as they say, you get what you pay for. For us, we will not be going back to the Reef. I will spend the extra money and go to a better resort.", "Date": "June 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cNot as horrible as some make it out tobe\u201d", "Author": "nate8uc", "ReviewID": "UR5377759", "Content": "Just returned from a long weekend at the Reef, and being an All-Inclusive and Playa del Carmen newbie, I really didn't have any grand expectations. My expectations were also limited by the old adage \"you get what you pay for,\" and considering that the Reef was on the lower end of the price spectrum, I wasn't expecting the Ritz. Apparently a few people did, and also had experiences that I didn't have, as well. I would rate it about a 3 star hotel, but they had the sun, beach, and pools that every other place else has, which is what I went to Mexico for. First, check in was simple, it took two seconds, and I wasn't sassed by any of the hotel staff and I was off to my room in no time. I also did not see a single timshare person the entire time I was there, but that is also a matter of timing, and I apparently missed them all. My girlfriend and I loved the way the Reef was set up, it felt more like a bunch of bungalows than a hotel, which was somewhat refreshing. The room was great, large bed, and considering that I can sleep anywhere, I didn't notice the firmness of the matress at all (some have said it is too hard). The only minor problems that I can forsee people having with the room is the air conditioner, which is really only on or off, but it was very refreshing to come home to that after being outside all day. Also, be careful in the showers and close the curtain all the way, or some water may seep out on the tile into the main room, but after the first shower we made sure to do so. But overall, the rooms were clean (great housekeeping staff), and were nice to come back to at night. The stories about restaurant reservations are true, you have to get there at 8 to get one. My gf went (while I slept) at 8:30 and it was already booked. And to the person who went at 7:30, was told to come back, and was angry that they couldn't call: to walk anywhere in the resort takes two minutes, and a half hour wait isn't the worst thing in the world; also, since it gets booked up so quickly, in-person reservations are the only sane way to do things. Anyways, the buffet food is not 5 star, and it tends to get old after a few days, but the snack bar was a good changeup for lunch and a late snack. Service at the buffet at dinner was slow (fine all the other times), and really was hit or miss. One night, you can't track anyone down, and the other your waiter was around all the time. The pools and beach were great, we never had a problem finding chairs before 11 AM, and all were never that crowded. We kayaked in the ocean twice, and saw a lot of other people using windsurfers, etc, which were no problem in getting your hands on. Now to the important stuff: Bars. It DID NOT take 15 minutes to get a drink at the pool bar. The longest it took was 5 minutes once, and on average I would say about 3 minutes, but after throwing a few $1's the bartenders way, he always noticed when you walked back and had your preferred drinks in hand. The other bar on the second floor in the lobby has a great setup, outside under a huge teepee like roof. That tended to get a bit crowded at times and took longer to get a drink, but never to the point of complaining. Also, if you got a table (if they were full, just wait 5 minutes), you had a waitress who was very responsive. But I found that of the actual bars, tipping made a bigger difference at the pool bar. The drinks were relatively weak, but with a few tips and some directions, you would get them as strong as you want. At night the resort definitely has a laid back feel, and there is no music or dancing at all. For me that was fine, as I just wanted to relax, but some of the people we met there wished there had been more going on. To each their own. All in all, we had a great time, and would stay at the Reef again if the price was right. It was a great first All-Inclusive experience, and would recommend it to other first timers, but to those who have stayed at other All-Inclusives that they actually consider as 4-stars, I would not recommend staying here, as you may be slightly disappointed. But on the other hand, if you are just looking for a place to relax and go with the flow, this is a great place.

Fortunately for tripadvisor, some people helped with the decision. However, I was sceptic because of some horrible reviews. As soon as I arrived (May 19th) I realized that the people that wrote those aweful reviews are very stuck up and look for the negative in everything! The hotel is beautiful. The beachs are small...but you cant blame that on the hotel..call mother nature and complain to her! But considering the damage that they suffered, really not that bad! I thought it to be plenty big! Plus i saw the beach of the other gargantuan resorts and they had the beach chairs lined up in rows one right next to another like a theater! Reef wasnt like that!! As you will see in the pictures! there are many 3 floor little building situated what seems to be a rainforest or jungle. Gorgeous!!! you enjoy your walk to anywhere. The one negative thing I can say is that this definitly isnt a 4 star...its like a great 3 star. Ive stayed at 5 stars in many places, 4 and 3 likewise...this is definitly a great 3 star. The rooms can be improved, but lets face it...how much time are you spending in there anyways. It was clean...thats all I ask for. There are only 2 restaurants...the buffet and an italian restaurant. Theres a mexican but it was closed because the hotel was only 60% full. The food was good...not increadible, but good. We were there for 5 days...and I think if we were there for one more day we would of went out to eat. I got a little tiered of it even though they did change it up everyday sort of. Theres also a snack bar open most of the day except during dinner with yummy stuff. Quesedillas, pizza, burgers, frys, ice cream and sandwiches. Everything very fresh! Some people compained that you couldnt get service on the beach...and personally i was happy that no one was bothering me every 5 minutes. They just let you be. if you are looking for a relaxing vacation, no one to bother you, beautiful surroundings, at a great price Reef is for you. BTW found a great deal on american express travel. I would definitly go back. Oh, I found it nice for families, however no screaming kids all over the place (one thing I was worried about...dont have kids, so i dont want to experience that yet). And like another person said in their review, this isnt a party type hotel either. However Playa del carmen is a 15 min walk, $5 taxi ride away. plenty of stuff to do there. AH one GENERAL critique of Playcar/Playa del carmen...not many ATMS! My huband and I arent used to carry much cash in us and just rely on ATMS or using creditcards! i recomend taking some dollars over (you can change it there) or once you find the ATM (non in ANY hotel) take out more than what you need, you can always change it back before you leave in the hotel or at the airport. But we definitly lacked cash in more than one time! We took a tour called the \"Sacred Blue: tour! FREAKIN awesome! We went to a Cenote (natural pool) with crystal I mean crystal clear water, and underground caves like no other (not good if you are claustophobic) and then snorkeling where the underground rivers meet the ocean so its half salty half sweet water! GREAT! Well I think thats about it! All I kept on thinking when I was at Reef is how wrong the negative people were about the hotel. You just have to look at the positive...no point in ruining your vacation!!! Go Relax, have a margarita, Pi\u00f1a colada, or some Sex on the beach, the drink too!

The only two things I didnt particullarly enjoy was the food, which I know a few people have mentioned, there isnt that big of a selection of food everyday but the taste was good.

There is also a very nice bar over the lobby bar that overlooks the little street that runs through Playacar, as well as a nice air-conditioned Ocean Lounge that opened (re-opened?) while we were there. The beach is nice, but a bit small and sometimes crowded. Apparently, people who rent vacation property in the Playacar area are allowed to use this beach and facilities ie., towels, restrooms in addition to being able to purchase day passes for meals/drinks. Maybe that happens at other resorts too, but we've never encountered that before. As well, most days you had to get down to the beach or pool early as people would drape chair after chair with towels (and alot of times didn't show up til noon). There is an exercise room that is located in one of the rooms, as the original location is still undergoing repairs from hurricane damage. There are two treadmills, an elliptical and a recumbent bike which are all brand new and Precor. However, there are no weights at all, which I believe is a temporary thing. Our only real complaint was that there were a group of high school seniors from Michigan who completely took over the place. They were very rude, inconsiderate of other people and demanding. Not to mention drunk. We found ourselves frequently relocating to get away from the obnoxiousness. As well, every night around 2 or 3, we'd hear them coming back from the bar hooting and hollering, slamming doors, glasses being dropped etc. Just something to keep in mind if you are booking here that the hotel doesn't discourage Spring Breaker type behaviour and a lot of people with teenagers seem to come here. We didn\u2019t really see many smaller children at all. This really is a nice resort and was a good value for what we paid, but definitely not as high-end as some of the other resorts in this area.

We chose this resort based on the 4.5 Star Rating from the tour operator (SUNQUEST), the generally positive reviews from this web site and the fact that the smaller size of the resort should have afforded more quiet and privacy. We were extremely disappointed. With out going into great detail here is a list of some things you may want to keep in mind about this resort. 1. The food was just horrible. It lacked variety, imagination, was always overcooked and the limited salad bar continually had empty dishes. To sum up...when one of the local furry creatures ran by someone would ask \"What is it?\" ...the reply came back as \"Breakfast, lunch and dinner\". The most frequent visitor to the resort was the Dominos Pizza delivery van. In fairness..the 2 specialty restaurants were pretty good and there were no restrictions as to the number of times you could eat at each one. Be prepared to be in line at 7:30 AM to get a reservation by 6:30 PM. 2. The only pool bar in the resort did not have any beer until 3:00 pm one day. 3. It was cheaper to book any excursions at the resort next door. 4. The bartenders at the pool bar poured drinks to anyone over the age of 13. You get the picture waht the result was. 5. When we checked in a customer was yelling at the front desk manager and when we left another customer was yelling at the front desk manager. (I mean yelling) 6. They advised us to drink bottled water and then THEY CHARGED FOR IT. 7. The lounge chairs were so crammed in together around the pool that you became really close to the person next to you. Oh ya...you better reserve you loung chair by 7:30 AM or you won't be lating next to anyone you recognize. We have been to several 4, 4.5 and 5 star resorts. This wasn't comparable to any.

Getting back to the Reef, when we first checked in we received a welcoming beverage which was impressive. We were then taken to our musty, mold-smelling room adjacent from the construction site which was very noisy. After trying to endure the situation for some time, we requested to change rooms, and our request was granted. The pools were small. There was a group of college students in the main pool and it appeared that they thought they had ownership over the pool, which was frustrating. The pool snack bar was DISGUSTING and dirty. It tasted as if the hamburgers were not made of real beef. Even after that experience we still ventured out and made reservations for dinner (TIP: Make reservations for dinner in the morning).

The vegetation and buildings and pools are generally in good shape, and were improving daily with workers swarming the resort. My main concerns lay with the management. Lots of empty promises. We had not a drop of hot water for 5 of our 7 days, despite assurances that it would be fixed immediately. Our room was missing towels and bottled water for 2 days. There were long lines in the dining room to be seated for meals because of a lack of hostessing organization and overcrowding. And the dining experience in general was a disappointment.

Yes the food is not gormet. You're in Mexico folks, their food may not be the quality you'd expect on a Carnival cruise but it was good food and the menu at the buffet place varied each day and if you left hungry it's because you didn't eat.Don't expect their menu to mirror the one you visit every Friday night back in your home town. They don't use Black Angus beef and it's not the Sizzler, the Golden Corral or any other chain buffet you usually visit,it's in Mexico.If you want gormet food, take that Carnival cruise.The Italian restaurant was good and the view from it at sunset will take your breath awayThe food was very good and the service was great. The grounds are terraced at the pool/beach area and very well done.The rooms are very nice and yes the mattresses are a bit hard but they're worse at the Best Western in Manchester New Hampshire that I stay in for the morning flights out.This is the first hotel in Playa my wife and I agree that we want to come back to instead of our usual \"well it was nice but let's try a different one next time\".

If you are friendly and get to know the bartenders they will even bring you what you like. The key is respect, yes it is all inclusive but they don't OWE you good service. You don't have to tip them or hang out with them, just say please and thank you. If you even go so far as to learn a few simple words in Spanish they appreciate your effort. You get your money's worth in the drinks, not the food. The rooms and food are the only reason I did not rate as excellent. The A/C in our room broke but they immediately offered to switch rooms because they could not fix it in a timely manner. There are plenty of free activites, although older children would be bored and the shows are free entertainment. The conceirge, Patty is nice and just trying to make a living. If you don't want to go to a time share just tell her no. The check out process was easy and no hassle, again never asked for our credit card. Bottom Line-- Go for the view and have a few drinks, don't expect 5 stars when you pay for 3! And remember, tourism is their livelyhood they want, try and NEED your business.

This resort is simply ok. I have been to Cancun several times but this was my time in Playa del Carmen. I can say without reservation that you get what you pay for at this resort.

I understand it is hard to keep a buffet hot for hours but...... Reservations have to be made for one of the resturants very early in the morning but is the only part of the resort that was above average. We tipped the bar staff and wait staff and for the most part they were wonderful during our stay. The maids were friendly and very fast. The front desk staff was neither. We were continually harassed by a time share rep although we were not interested in purchasing anything. Very annoying woman. The bar pool always had leaves and such but was okay. There is construction next door which could also be the reason for the state of the pool but does not hinder your enjoyment of the water and was not a concern. Our room was okay but without the extras we were told we would have (i.e. mini fridge, ironing board). We decided there would be no point in contacting the front desk about this. Unfortunately the noise from the hallway carried in sometimes as though the door was open. I think the pictures and description on the internet are decieving, the resort is very small and in my opinion not very well appointed. On the positive side, the beach was excellent. The grounds are beautiful and lush. You can get something to eat until the wee hours of the morning. It is a good place to stay if money is your main concern.

My husband & I are not picky traveleres, as we've traveled to Playa Del Carmen several times before, and have stayed anywhere from 2-6 star resorts. My few complaints about this resort is the food, organization from the staff, and being hunted down by the promotions lady. My biggest complaint was the FOOD. And again, I'm not a picky eater, but this resort had next to nothing. I could barely find anything for breakfast, lunch was ok but very marginal, and dinner was extremely marginal to poor. My best advice is if your going to a resort for food, then isn't the place for you. You will be very disappointed. We wanted to make reservations for the one restuarant that they have, which is the Botaccoli (italian) and we had no idea where to make the reservations, so we assumed in the restaurant would be where to go. When we got there they said go to the lobby they can help you, so we walked upto the lobby, then the lobby people said, no go down to the buffet. To say the least, nobody at the hotel had any idea where we should go (not very organized.) AND BEWARE!!! WHEN YOU CHECK IN AT THE REEF PLAYACAR YOU WILL BE HUNTED DOWN BY A NICE LADY (IT'S A FACADE) SHE WILL PRETEND TO HELP YOU CHECK-IN, BUT WHAT SHE REALLY IS A PROMOTIONAL SALES PERSON.

Also, the next day at the beach another lady came upto us trying to sell us the same thing. Again, we had to lie to her (it's like they have your pic and are trying to hunt you down. pretty annoying) she said to us that she would remove our name off the list..........THANK GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!

The buffet consisted of 2 buffet tables, a grill, and a dessert fridge. There was not much selection the whole time we were there. The wait staff was very friendly and helpful. We finally went to the desk to get checked in. I asked for matches-they had none. We were told to go see the time share guy who would explain the Reef to us. Since they were out of color maps, he gave us a tiny copied map to take with us. He was not as persistant as most salesmen, so it only took us about 15 minutes. We got to our rooms, which were better than we expected. They were very clean, cool, and had a TV that received many English stations that came in well. The water pressure was fine and we had plenty of hot water. There was no mini fridge, which we have come to really like over the years. The beds were hard, but comfortable-we slept well. The large closet has sliding mirror doors which seemed to increase the size of the room. The balcony railing is constructed of logs, so there is no privacy, especially since they all face a walkway. The pools are vey nice and clean and well placed. You can sit by either pool and see the ocean. The daily activities around them are well attended and fun. One pool has a swim up bar. This bar is way understaffed and undersupplied. The bartender had to quit serving drinks and go collect cups from the pool area to have enough to serve people. The stools in the water were occupied by children a lot, preventing the adults from sitting there. There were only a few brand name liquors, but the drinks tasted fine to me. The beach is fairly narrow with many chairs on it. There were always plenty of chairs available. We noticed only 3 topless ladies while we were there. You can only walk the beach a short distance to the north, as someone has built a patio that extends out into the water. On the south end, a new resort is being built, but the beach is very walkable. The construction workers kept as constant vigil on the Reef's guests, peering over the short fence and taking pictures. The boys took a trip to Sr Frog's that was sponsored by the Reef animation team. It was $23 for transportation and open bar. After being there a while, a waitress came by with a tray of drinks. All the boys took one, then she told them that would be $11 each! They had no money, so she was going to call the police. The chaperone supposedly paid her. Almost sounds like a scam.

Although the resort charges for bottled water you can refill them for free at the restaurant. Rent a lock at the front desk for your safe deposit box in your room (just gives you an added peace of mind for $2 a day). Avoid the \"concierge\" when you check in. It is a timeshare pitch.

This was the first time we booked a Funjet vacation and we were a little skeptical hoping everything would fall into place. Well, it did and then some. We were pleasantly suprised @ how nice the Reef really was. The kids (7 yrs & 11 yrs) loved the beach and pools and could not get enough Pina Colladas @ the bar pool. The buffet was very nice. Food and fruit always looked fresh and we enjoyed getting what we wanted when we wanted. Very convenient. (especially with children). We've never done an all inclusive before and this was a great experience. You will get great service if you bring a little extra to tip. We gave our maid about $3 a day. Our room was always clean after a day at the beach. With as little as they make a day, why not make their day and give them a few bucks? Do keep in mind that the walls are very thin and with the cinderblock construction and tile, things echo and sound loud sometimes. This has been a common experience in Mexico and not necessarily in this one particular location. We had ear plugs and that helped a lot if things got a little loud. We did hear the construction but our room was facing away from it so it didn't seem that bad. I suppose if your balcony faced where things were happening it could be a little bothersome. There seemed to always be someone cleaning, sweeping or working the grounds. This was nice to see things being taken care of and maintained. The guys at the dinner buffet were nice. We found that tipping a few bucks here also helped get our drinks faster. They were nice to everyone (tips or not) but it seemed that those who tipped got their drinks first and they returned to you afterwards to see if you wanted another or if you needed anything else. Most of our time was spent on the beach and pool area. Some days were were at the beach all day! There are many women (of all shapes & sizes) that choose to go topless. Just keep that in mind when you bring the kids. We told ours beforehand and they didn't make a big deal of it because we didn't. We did not experience anything bad (i.e. very drunk people), we felt very safe, and would definitely come back here again. I think the thing to remember is that you are in Mexico, you are experiencing a different culture, and that you need to sit back and take it all in. There were many people visiting from all over the world here and all types (familes with several children, some with none).

The construction IS bad, and they do start hammering away loudly at 7 am sharp. They don't work on Sundays though, so it's nice and quiet then! We didn't mind so much, we were up by then anyway! The pool area was still being re-tiled when we were there, but only at night. However the area is roped off during the day. Personally, I thought the food was pretty good. I read alot of complaints about it but we found it very delicious for an all inclusive. I definitely recommend getting a safe in your room, I read alot of reviews talked about theft, and sure enough when we arrived there was a lady at the desk complaining that her purse had been stolen. And let me tell you - the staff did not seem to care one bit and in fact seemed very annoyed they even had to deal with it. When we got to our room our safe wouldn't open but I called the front desk and they had someone there in 10 min to fix it. FYI - When you arrive you will be told you have a \"welcome package\" and if I were you I would just say no and leave it there. Basically all it is is a chance for someone to pitch a time share to you. They hounded us for days about this, and I really didn't appreciate that they acted for all intents and purposes to be real employees of the hotel - which they are NOT. HOWEVER, you will come across these folks everywhere, not just your hotel. They are in the airport, the street, etc. They all have the same pitch and they all want you to come look at their resort and if you do so you get a bottle of tequila and a discount on the activity of your choice (snorkelling, dolphins, etc). We finally got one of them to explain what was really going on and apparently they make $150 in commission if they get you to show up to the resort. They are very persistent and we found it almost intolerable how many times we were approached about it! I think they target couples only because their qualifying questions start with how old you are, are you married, etc. I think they have to find married couples over 30 to get their money.

This is the 5th trip I have booked to this area. In the past we have stayed at other resorts and all of these trips have been quite enjoyable and well worth the cost of the vacation. Reef Playacar was a major disappointment. It was presented as a 4 star resort but the quality and service was deplorable. I would rate it no more than a 1 star simply for misrepresentation. After spending more than 6 hours in transit the concierge would not allow us to go to our rooms when we had checked in until she had made a sales pitch for another type of resort. There were 12 people in our party, 4 of which were small children, and the last thing any of us wanted was to spend another 20 minutes listening to a sales pitch. After turning her down then she called our rooms and hounded us for two more days about this. We had to avoid the front lobby just to stay out of her way. The rooms were somewhat small and the beds had to the hardest mattresses I have ever slept on. The lighting that worked in the rooms was poor. The only electrical outlet in the entire room was in the bathroom. This resort advertised internet service but every time we went down to try and access the internet the front desk told us they were out of prepaid internet cards until the next day; this happened 3 out of 5 days. The staff in general was rude and unhelpful. They seemed to consider the guests an inconvenience rather than the source of their employment. Not one time in our 5 day trip did a staff member offer services to me. Instead I had to seek someone out and ask for services. The bartenders were the worst of all; at one point I had to stand at the bar for more than 5 minutes just to get the bartender to acknowledge I was standing there and there was no line of people, just me. To top it all off they were under some sort of construction so we received a wake up call of hammers, drills, etc. every morning at 7:00 a.m. In addition, painting the stairways in our building seemed to be a bigger priority than any kind of service. Not to mention that this painting created quite a safety hazard for my small grandchildren. The quality of the food was mediocre at best and they charged for bottled water. We were told that we would have access to a hospitality suite on our last day because checkout was at noon and our flight didn\u2019t leave until 7:30 p.m. The suite we were given was a room that had been previously used by someone else and was not cleaned prior to us getting the room. There were dirty linens left in the room as well as trash everywhere. In hindsight I believe my money would have been better spent at a Motel 6 rather than this resort.

Here's why: Although the majority of our vacation was wonderful, we have some major hotel issues that need to be reviewed by anyone planning on staying here. Upon our arrival to the Reef Playacar we were immediately seized upon by the \u201cConcierge\u201d by the name of Angie. She was quite the actress. She welcomed us like no other. She explained that she was there to help us if we needed ANYTHING. Then she proceeded to tell us that we were VIP and that we were invited to attend their neighboring hotel just for a look. We asked why we were VIP and she said because we are with Funjet. She said they wanted to impress us and share with us their sales presentation. If we went, we\u2019d receive breakfast and a $60 gift certificate good towards any tour and a $50 gift certificate good toward the Reef marina. She showed us some of the marina water sports we could use the certificate on and the one we were excited about was parasailing. She said it was $50 for one person and $70 for two people. What a deal, we thought. We also thought it would be nice to see their time-share facilities. We agreed to attend knowing it was a sales presentation. Two days later we tried to redeem our Reef Marina certificate for parasailing. The gentleman at the Reef Marina booth told us it would be $50 for one person and $70 for tandem. We were strongly cautioned not to take a digital camera up while parasailing so we went to buy a water camera. After we purchased the camera, the weather went bad and a storm came in not allowing us to sail. We decided we\u2019d try the next day. We returned the next day and a different older man was tending the Reef Marina and told us the cost was $50 for one person and $90 for tandem. WHAT? A $20 increase from the day before? No way! We explained our story that Angie the \u201cConcierge\u201d told us it was $70 for tandem and that the younger gentleman a the marina the day before told us $70 also. So why the increase? It didn\u2019t make sense. We argued back and forth about it and the Reef Marina employee said that we were told wrong and they weren\u2019t going to pay the difference. So we marched up to the hotel \u201clobby\u201d to find a manager who conveniently wasn\u2019t there and was \u201cwalking around the property somewhere\u201d. Doesn\u2019t he have a cell phone or two-way radio on him so that the front lobby could communicate with him for any reason? No, no he doesn\u2019t we were told. How foolish and unprofessional! A hotel manager with no way to communicate with him no matter what emergency took place. We are by now thinking this is joke of a hotel. Totally ridiculous and downright absurd. We asked for our \u201cconcierge\u201d Angie but the \u201cconcierge\u201d on duty said she wasn\u2019t there that day. She asked us of our story and we explained. Then, (sit down for this one), the \u201cconcierge\u201d tells us that they are not related to the hotel. WHAT? Did we hear that right?\u2026. You have \u201cconcierge\u201d desks, \u201cconcierge\u201d names tags but you aren\u2019t associated with the hotel. What kind of hokey fraud is this? She then proceeds to explain that they are really officiated with the time-share company, Fisherman\u2019s Village, next door. Oh, OK. So we were deceived when we first got there and were told by Angie the \u201cconcierge\u201d that if we need anything just call her?! And now that we needed the \u201cconcierge\u201d they aren\u2019t willing to help. Amazing isn\u2019t it? Now that there is a problem, no one wants to help. So finally we were able to meet with the hotel manager, Angle. We told him our story about the marina employee and Angie. We wanted the parasailing for $70 just like we were told by two separate people, one who is the \u201cconcierge\u201d who also told us to see her if we need anything. (We guess she lost her manners and forgot to tell us that if there happens to be a problem not to contact her because she won\u2019t do anything about it). Kind of funny, huh! After explaining the story, AGAIN to Angle, the manager, he calls Angie and Angie did agree that she told us $70 for two people to parasail. So the manager said, there\u2019s nothing he can do about it. We asked if he could pay the difference and he said \u201cNo, I cannot give you cash\u201d. (Are you getting the big picture here?) So now that there is a problem, nobody wants to take responsibility and nobody wants to help their paying customers get what they were told. (How would you feel by now? Lied to? Deceived? Being taking advantage of? HA! To say the least!) So Angle, after seeing our persistence on getting this resolved he (out of the kindness of his little heart, he offered to take the room safe charges off our bill) Oh goody, a $13 refun. Yippee! We were shocked at how badly we were treated. In addition to this oh so lovely experience one of the days at the hotel we had no hot water for 24 hours and during those 24 hours some of the time we had no water at all. We had to wash our hands with the bottled water that we had paid for. The manager didn't care about that either and said, that just happens. (A transfer to a different section of hotel would have been nice.) We are extremely disappointed in the lack of professionalism and customer service at the Reef Playacar.

I know some folks have reported that they hardly noticed the construction. But let me tell you, if you had a room on that side of the resort, you noticed it and it was LOUD. We're talking jackhammering and other cement work down LOUDLY! Our balcony overlooked the construction, and was roughly 30 yards from it. Without fail, 7:00 a.m. every morning it started and there was no sleeping once it started. I realize there is another half of the resort that \"hardly noticed\", but that leaves the other half of the buildings that was innundated with the noise. The noise was also audible at the pool and on the beach, but there it was more muted and easier to ignore. The buildings to avoid: 1, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18. If you are told you are going to be in one of those buildings, make all efforts to get a different building! It will change your vacation dramatically. Overall, I had an excellent vacation.

The size is perfect, the beach is beautiful, and the grounds are great. So, if you can handle the worst service and terrible business practices, it's not so bad.

The beds are hard as a rock and don't even bother asking about the pillows. The worst part is that the managment does not seem to have any problems with making people pay for rooms where the area around the rooms is under rennovation and there is constant terrible noise and inconvience. And I don't mean the huge construction going on at the property next door...I mean replacing tile right OUTSIDE your door and still thinking you should spend your vacation there. The food. The snack bar was good and the omlettes were good. The drinks. Weak, small, and slow in the making. At least the pool bar is open late. The service, or shall I say, lack thereof: I can't imagine running a business with a staff like that. Rude, misleading, unhelpful, you name it. I really dislike being treated like that, especially when I am paying for it. The staff did not even try to help. For instance, when my sister wanted to call her kids at home, they said your room phone does not work. When she asked where a pay phone was, they said there were none, you have to go into town. (THERE WAS ONE 25 FEET AWAY FROM THE FRONT DESK). When we went to the lobby and asked them to dial a room, the did. When we got back to our room and asked them to dial it again, they said there was nobody staying there by that name. We repeated it, spelled it, etc. \"Nobody staying here by that name\" they tell us. Even though they just dialed the magically disappearing guests 7 minutes ago. And they were not nice about it either. The business practices: Let me share my story on how unethical the managment can be. We booked almost 60 people with this resort for my wedding, and had 3 of them stay at the sister resort (parents) because of the transfer privelages. That way we can visit them, they can visit us, and we can all keep our budget in tact. Well, 3 days before we leave, they call the parents, (even though it is my wedding and I made all the arrangements) and tell them the transfer privelages no longer apply. (Apparently the resorts split their affiliations ro ties to one another, but remainded under the same owner) This news came AFTER they had our money of course. We spent 1.5 days there fighting this, and while they finally made a minor concession to let the parents transfer for 2 days, 4 of the kids + spouses, 1 aunt + husband and kids, all spent a lot of extra money because of the lack of transfer privelages. I felt like they pulled a bait and switch and were very unwilling to accomodate us and it personally cost me almost 500 US dollars. I wish they were better, because of the beach and size, but other than the wedding coordinators (who thankfully, were amazing, wonderful, etc.), It was awful.", "Date": "June 2, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cPerfect, i love it!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3511014", "Content": "People have been complainning quite a bit too much about the noise in this hotel because of the construction going on next door.

What I felt like was really poor was the fact that they have workers working late into the night hammering and chiseling removing pieces of the tile flooring outside of your room. We called 3 times to complain about the worker at the base of our stairs until he finally stopped about 11:30pm. Each time we were told they would send someone to check on it. They obviosly told us that just to get us off the phone. Our next door neighbors said they too had called several times. In addition, at almost every meal we had to go to the bar area ourselves to ask for water or soda, because a waiter never came to ask what we'd like. We'd be almost finished with our meal, and still nothing to drink. The grounds are very pretty and the food was good, it's just too bad that their employees all over the resort just kind of have an attitude that you're a pain in the butt and they wish you weren't there at all. We are friendly and polite, but never got that back in response. We are planning a large group trip back to Playa Del Carmen in the fall and we will not be returning to The Reef.", "Date": "May 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kimberley Ontario Canada", "Title": "\u201cPoor Quality/Choice of food\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3481759", "Content": "We were disappointed in this hotel not just because of the construction but also because of the 4 star rating in the brochure for food and amenities which it clearly is not.

April 18-28th. We had our 1st yr Anniversary there. What a awesome time we had! We ate&drank our selfs from morning till night! We mostly stayed at the resort the whole time, because we did everything the last time that we were there. We visited Xel-ha again, and shopped at 5th ave lots. That was about the only things that we did outside of the resort. The Reef has really improved since we were there last ( more so the food). WAY better! The snack bar has really improved! Loved the snack bar! The buffet was good! Really have no complaints at all about it. My husband and i ate lots of the salad bar, and the fruits. One week they had a mexican night, and it was pretty good. The next night they had a chineese night, and i thought it was really good! A lot of the same staff still there. Maybe a few new ones. My husband found some of the staff that weren't so friendly last yr, to be more friendlyr this time! Botticelli's was really good this time! Better then last time (my opinion). The service at Botticelli's was absolutelyawesome! They are always right there when ur drink is empty, and very polite! It felt so nice to be treated so good!I forgot to mention that we went on a snorkling tour through our resort. They took us to the coral reefs by coco beach. It was awesome, but tones and tones of tiny brown jelly fish floating on the surface everywhere!! You couldn't get away from then. I was a little freaked, because this guy beside me said that they can sting u, and i have never been around jelly fish before. So, i couldn't enjoy myself knowing that they were everywhere, and thinking that they are going to sting. Well, for those who have never been around them before, be careful. About 12 hrs later i developed a allergic reaction from them ( hives). It was soo aweful! I only got them on my upper body, arms, neck, chest , half of my lower face. I think that i got them worse because i have sensitive skin. My husband was fine. I guess i was the unlucky one. The workers were always so concerned, and always ask me how i am doing, do i need anything. I thought that it was really nice of them! They are making the Reef into a 5 star. Adding a Mexican restaurant on the beach. Redoing the lobby, making it more fancy. Remodling the rooms, by putting big screens, and mini bars. There are a few other things, but can't remember. They have already started the work. They are just doing it bit by bit right now. It's going to be done Nov.1st. Anyone that is going, expect to be around construction. It didn't bother us. they were mostly working around the pool, and we were never around there. The beach has changed drastically, since last year. I couldn't believe what mother nature could do to a beautiful beach. They lost quite a bit of the beach, and about 6 palipas from Ivan. the reef's beach is in much better condition then a couple resorts to the right of the reef. The other resorts next door, have huge sand bags all over, and a green tube running from the beach into the ocean. Not sure what that's used for. We think either for the sand or water. We sat at the beach everyday for 8hrs, and it didn't bother us one bit that the beach has changed so much. It's still so beautiful! We were just thankful that we were in paradise, and were able to go back to the resort for a 2nd time. We only had 2 days that were really windy, and noticed that some of the beach was taken away from the big waves and wind. I was a little amazed how that happened in just 1 day. The construction never bothered us at all. It woke us up at 7am almost every morning, but we wanted to be up early. Who wants to sleep in while on Vacation?! Some days the workers were on the other part of the resort, so u would never hear them at all. Sunday is their only day off, and they work for 12hr a day. I couldn't believe all the building going on in Playacar!! There is 2 resorts being built that i seen in playacar, and one right by senor frogs (ocean front), with NO beach. I have read a few bad reviews about the resort. My husband and I do not agree one bit about what others have said , then again, we are not picky people and don't have high expectations.

I recommend anyone doing the same. While we were there we talked to quite a few people who's main gripe with the hotel was the construction. In my opinion, I think they were doing their best to accomodate people, but there is only so much a hotel can do. Second of all, we weren't going there for gourmet food and didn't expect it. I think a lot of people expect 4 star cuisine like many of the \"resorts\" here in the States. Please keep in mind you are traveling to a foreign country and just cannot expect things to go as they go in the States. I think if you keep that in mind your vacation and stay here will go a lot better. The hotel was incredible -- we had a very good time! We would definitely go back to this resort.

We are all from the Midwest, USA. I believe all our expectation were either met or exceeded. Please don't let the bad reviews on this site deter you!! The Reef, IMO, is a great place to stay for the price!! Our room was clean, but a tad musty smelling (you are in the tropics by the ocean). From reading the reviews on this website, my wife threw in some small aromatic candles that provided a fresh smell to the air. The bed was very comfortable. Usually, my wife's lower back will ache after several days in a hotel. Not here! Bathroom was clean and we always had hot water. Room service was nice and quick. We didn't bother tipping and still received a clean room every day (as expected in an all-inclusive place). BTW, be sure to get the safety deposit box. Well worth the $2/day rate for peace of mind. I also read about all the construction going on next door. It didn't bother us one iota. But, we were not in the rooms that border the construction site. The hotel grounds were very clean, nicely manicured, with a canopy of trees keeping it cool. A great atmosphere to be in! We played a lot in the main pool. The games varied, but volleyball was our main game. The swim-up bar in the adult pool is great. The drawback, however, is the fact that the kiddy pool next to it was being worked on (new tiles). That resulted in all the kids playing in the adult pool. Not too bad, but more an annoyance. Staff was always friendly and would greet us no matter the time of day. We thought the food at the restaurants was very good. We always found something to fill us up. The morning omelet was always our main course for breakfast. Lunch was usually the Mexican pizza at the grill by the beach. We ate dinner one night at the Italian restaurant on the grounds (need reservations). The food there was very good, and nicely portioned, unlike American restaurants that bring way too much food. We left there feeling full, not bloated. Our only gripe is there was never any Mexican-style food served in the other restaurant. No chips or salsa for lunch or dinner, although the wives did manage to get some for lunch by asking. If you are a scuba diver, you must go Cenote (cavern) diving! Cozumel diving is excellent, but Cenote diving is an experience you don't want to miss. We went with Phantom Divers located in downtown Playacar. At $80 per person (gear included), it was the best price we could find for a 2-tank dive. Good hole-in-the-wall but safe dive shop. Check-in and out was quick and simple. No surprise charges. The tips on this site that we used are highly recommended: -take plenty of $1.00's for tipping and taxi rides ($4-$6 bucks/taxi to go into town) -take candles/room freshener (although we were hardly in our room) -take large cups with lids for your drinks -get the safety deposit box -reserve your beach-side seat early -go there with medium expectations and you will have a great time This place is well worth the little money we paid and we would go back without hesitation.", "Date": "May 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colorado", "Title": "\u201cStay Away!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3437941", "Content": "Reef Playacar is an unfortunate joke: 1.

I thought that a good objective review would be helpful to folks after getting back so here goes: My wife and I stayed 5 days - Apr 25-29th. Rooms - Our first room had a double bed so we immediately changed to a Queen. Unfortunately it was on the South side of the resort next to the construction. There were no other rooms available until Wednesday at which time we moved to a room on the other side. All three rooms were comfortable but they all had a faint moist/stuffy smell and feel. It is the jungle though so it didn't really bother me too much. Construction - it is going on everywhere - I mean all over the coast but specifically right next door. It is pretty obnoxious and I'd highly recommend getting a room on the North side of the resort. When we were on that side we could barely hear the construction noise. When were on the otehr side though you could hear them banging away as early as 6:30 am. There was also construction at the Reef - there were some guys working on a small section of the pool everyday. It wasn't bothersome for the most part but one section of the bar pool remained closed the whole time. Service - most of the staff were friendly but no one was going out of their way to help you unless you were tipping. Most of these folks work pretty hard and I don't mind tipping (even at an all-inclusive) but there is a noticeable decrease in service if you don't. So if you don't mind walking to the bar it shouldn't really affect you. If you expect to be waited on hand and foot I suggest bringing some small bills. Beach - the beach was small but nice esp compared to the other resort close by. Good swimming, snorkelling etc. Forget boogie boarding - the waves aren't near big enough. Food/alcohol - adequate but certainly not top notch. We ate at the \"fancy\" restaurant 1 night. It was decent but will probably not compare to you favorite local Italian place. The Lunch buffets were also decent - I don't eat chicken, beef or pork but never went hungry. The wine is pretty bad and the beer, well I happen to like Dos Equis, but I live in the microbrew capital of the US and am very picky. So I hope you like Dos Equis. The mixed drinks were fun and plentiful. We ate in town 2 nights and enjoyed both restaurants. Entertainment - We saw one show - the 70's show thing and found it to be pretty darn funny. If you are into kitschy entertainment you'll love it although I'm not sure this is what they intended. The day stuff was fun to watch but we never really got into it. The young staff that puts this stuff on seem to work all day every day. It can't be easy to try and get everyone to have fun all day long. Misc - EVERYONE seems to smoke but that is not exclusive to the Reef. EVERYONE wants to give you something for checking out their resort. Ignore them. People will also ask you to book your side trips through them. We did a tour through Best Day and did Telum/Xel Ha combo but did Xcaret on our own. Both places are expensive but worth it in my opinion. The cerviche at Xel Ha is great. Overall - We had a great time. We spent only 2 days at the resort during the day b/c we really wanted to see the other stuff - ecoparks, ruins, the town, etc. I guess if you are the type to stay at the resort this might not be the best but I'll bet not the worst, either. If you need a decent place in a great location look no further. We probably would not stay here again but only b/c I'm the type to want to try out different places and I'm not 100% sure I'd do another all-inclusive. I did like the landscape jungle setting and the fact that this is not a 900 room place. Its close proximity to town and Xcaret make it pretty nice.

The restaurant ran out of ice cream and beer at least twice during our week long stay , we ate out three days. Kids Club-The kid's club is 15 yards from the ocean and there is really no control in place to ensure the children stay safe, our 6 year old would leave through the door in the small playgound. Theft- We we were cheking in this 11 year old kid was complaining about something being stolen from his room, I thought nothing of it.

After the incident I asked the manager to please have the workers not work in front of my room, he said no problem, the next day they were woking unsupervised inside the room below us. More than getting robbed this lack of concern and respect really ticked me off. It was the peak season and work was going on with little regard for guests.

After booking our trip in November of last year, I started to get concerned after reading some of the comments about the Reef. I should not have worried. We had a wonderful time. The construction that everyone complained about was not bothersome at all. I had a room on the second floor that overlooked the construction site and it was actually very interesting to watch them work. They usually started around 6:30-7:00 AM, but did not use any heavy equipment until 8:00 AM. By the time I returned to my room in the evening there was no noise at all. I suppose if you were spending the afternoon in your room that it might be bothersome, but if you aren't out enjoying the beautiful setting here I guess you deserve to be unhappy. The Reef is built over a cenote, and the setting is beautiful. They've done a nice job of blending the resort with the jungle. I found the food to be good, especially the omolettes in the morning. There was plenty of fruits. There were some days that the selection was better, but I certainly never went hungry. You could always find something enjoyable to eat. The food in the Italian restaurant was decent, nothing spectacular. We enjoyed the change of pace of the \"formal\" dinner. The Reef is a smaller resort that what we have stayed in before, but I found that to be a good thing. We always found chairs available whether it was on the beach, in the sun at the pools, or under the shade trees between pools. We took a walk along the beach back toward all the other resorts and I was amazed at the amount of beach erosion that has occurred. We had stayed at the Allegro in 2001, and their beach was less than half the size as before. The Reef actually had one of the better beaches along this stretch. We were with a fairly large group of friends so we made our own entertainment in the evening in the outdoor bar above the lobby, but it would have been nice if there was some evening entertainment geared more for the adults. The staff was very helpful and courteous. They were very accomodating in getting our group in rooms that were fairly close to each other. The check in and check out process here was not as busy as the other resorts we have stayed at, probably because of the smaller size. Overall, I would definitely recommend this resort. As with any of the resorts here, it is Mexico, and you do have to be prepared for the fact that everything may not go exactly as you anticipated. But it is Mexico, and that's part of the charm.", "Date": "April 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington", "Title": "\u201cDon't believe everything you Read!!\u201d", "Author": "Patticcs", "ReviewID": "UR3353044", "Content": "I just returned two days ago after spending a week at the Reef. Like most of the others that have written reviews, I too was concerned by the many negative comments. To my delight none were true, other than so-so food. I have stayed in 4 different locations in Playacar and consider this stay one of the best. I stayed at the Gala, which is much more expensive, and I can honestly say only the food is better. The rooms are great at the Reef, much better than at the Gala or Allegro. True, there is construction going on, but the staff will do all they can to move you if you request. I had a construction/oceanview room and was not bothered one bit. The construction begins around 7:30 AM, the machinery around 8:00 AM and all ends between 5:30-6:30 PM. I'm an early riser so it didn't bother my sleeping. The food is fine, I have never been to any resort that pleased me every single day, but there is always something good to eat. Truth is, all these resorts have free flowing food and nearly everyone over eats. When you eat and you're not that hungry food doesn't taste as good! Regarding the last person that wrote in stating they charge you for the water and don't mention that at the time of check in, that's true. However I find the large tag on the bottle that states, \"if you chose to drink this water instead of the tap, which is 100% purified, you will be charged $1.00 per bottle\", that's enough information for me! The entertainment is pretty amateurish, but these kids work their tails off all day long and then have to prance around the stage for a hand full of folks with little appreciation. Frankly if I were in their shoes I wouldn't work any harder than they already are. This resort is laid out very nicely with the restaurant having a full ocean view. Again this was a welcomed bonus since none of the other resorts I've stayed at had this. Due to the resorts smaller size, if you have children or teens with you it's much much easier to keep track of them. But don't ask my friend Jeri about that!! (inside joke!) The check in at the Reef was easy, swift and accomodating, something I did not find at the other properties. The Reef Club is the first in the string of resorts in Playacar and is within walking distance to Playa Del Carmen. At the other resorts generally speaking a cab was necessary. If I was put in charge of club management and had the ability to make changes I would see if food could be a little more inventive, especially the speciality restaurant that you make reservations for; I would get some additional staff for the shows at night since those poor kids must be exhausted; and I would get some sort of a late night club/dancing available for the adults. The upstairs bar is nice that's open till 2:00 AM, but there's nothing to do but drink. Give me a dance floor and some music and I'm a happy camper! Would I return, absolutely... bring your friends and have a great vacation. Oh, I almost forgot.

I had read all of the reviews posted, and was slightly worried, but decided to keep an open mind. This is our third time visiting this area. Previously we have stayed at the Riu Yucatan, and the Viva Maya. We arrived at the hotel a little early, around 1:30pm. At that time, we asked for a room away from the construction that was taking place next door (it\u2019ll be another Riu hotel) At 3:00, which is check in time, we were given a room that looked directly AT the construction site. I guess he didn\u2019t hear us earlier! We asked for another room, and asked the desk person to show us on a map where the room was in relation to the construction. It was actually on the same side of the grounds as the construction, but looked toward the garden side of the Reef Club Hotel. He gave us the key to the room, so we could look at it before we agreed to take it. The noise from the construction was not disruptive at all. The rooms are pretty basic, with no frig or mini bar. There are 2 double beds, basic satellite tv, bathroom includes a shower/bath tub and a hair dryer. There is not a lot of water pressure in the shower, and the hot comes and goes. Our bathroom light switch was hanging off the wall. BE CAREFUL of the large lamp that sits on the night table between the beds. There are 4 switches BEHIND the lamp that works the overhead lights and the ceiling fan in the room. We broke the lamp trying to turn off the lights, and were asked for 700 pesos from the front desk manager (Rafael). Maybe we should not have been so honest! Rafael did cut the price down to 500 pesos (woo!) because we complained that the lamp was in a bad spot. We told him not to put another lamp in the room. As a nice gesture (?) he agreed to give us 2 t-shirts. We never saw him again, and we didn\u2019t get the t-shirts. The maid will leave 2 bottles of water in your room every day. YOU WILL BE CHARGED FOR THESE when you check out!! They say that you CAN drink the tap water \u2013ewww. We were not informed about the charge when we were checking in. We had a cracked glass in our room that wasn\u2019t changed for 2 days. When the maid finally took it away, she did not replace it. We left tips and candy for the maid. The only day we left nothing for the maid was the only day that she made swans out of our bath towels. There is a good size safety deposit box in the room which will cost you 2USD upon checkout. The air conditioner was quiet, but the remote for it didn\u2019t work. The remote for the TV was fine. After the lamp incident, we were not complaining about anything. After all, we were only there for one week. The hotel grounds are lovely \u2013 well manicured and jungle like. Small rodent-like (capybara) mammals can be seen on the grounds. If you're watching, you will see bats flying around at dusk. This is a small hotel, (200 rooms) which makes it very easy to get to know ALL of the other guests. Our new friendships made our trip to this hotel absolutely AWESOME! The food at the buffet restaurant was ample -- the soups were delicious, plenty of fresh fruit, and veggies, and usually a variety of dishes with chicken, pork and beef. (Remember this is NOT a 5-star hotel.) You can get chocolate or vanilla ice cream cones too. The staff will ask that you wear shoes in the restaurant at lunch time. A cover up would be nice as well. No dress code for the evening meal at the a la carte restaurant. (I was thankful that there was no one trying to sell me a time share at this property.)

After a quick round of the grounds on our first day, it was clear that if one enjoys a tightly packed, noisy, screetchy, squacky hen house, this place would be heaven. Unfortunately, this was not our scene. The staff is mostly friendly - the less English they speak, the nicer they are. Our clearning lady created different animals from fresh towels every day to the sheer delight of the kids. There was some strange weirdness in service, like completely refusing to serve ice-cream in a cup/dish instead of a cone. After several attempts at trying to understand why it is so problematic, I took it in a cone and immediately dumped it into a cup for my 3 year old. Also, the tables at the restaurant would have the oddest assortment of silverwear - some had several forks and no spoons, some had many knives and spoons, but no forks. I guess the staff just plopped down whatever happened to be in their hand at the time they were passing by. Food is passable - there was enough fresh fruit and veggies to survive, and soups were mostly interesting, but we were not expecting anything close to gourmet anyway. Drinks are mostly slop, watered down, including beer, but they are plentiful - so if your goal is to get sloshed, it is certainly possible. Grounds are nice, pools are decently clean, beach is fine, activities are tepid, we never made to any of the shows. \"Reservation only\" restaurant has nice atmosphere, but the food quality is at best the same as downstairs, or even worse! Some days the food was noticeably better than others - they must have different chefs, or maybe the chef partied too much before the bad days. But our big fear - upset stomacs, did not materialize! The bad thing is having to guard your towel - you are allowed one towel per person, which you can change as many times during the day as needed. But if you lose a towel, you pay $35. More than once we saw people staring at the empty chaise lounges were they placed their towels a few hours back - not a pleasant feeling on your vacation. Rooms are small, but clean, if tiny little critters don't bother you (tiny ants that love damp)- but you have to expect some life forms - there is a jungle out there. Kids claim they saw a groundhog on the grounds, but somehow I think it was some other critter. And to answer someones question - yes, there is a hair dryer in the bathroom. It's right above the electric plug where you would plug in your own hair dryer, quite difficult to miss.

If the staff at Allegro did not know the answer they would find out because they knew they would see you again. At Reef this was not the case and that part of the caring was not there. The food was much better at the Allegro although not to North American standards. For months the food review at Reef has been poor overall and you would think someone should be listening to monitor this, however no one was. The breakfast buffet presented trays of slop with no change to the fruit table. The poor Omelet lady was overwhelmed becuase the selection lacked otherwise. Lunch was very average and dinner we were forced to try elsewhere . We ate at the Italian twice and the service was better but the food was poor quality. so we went to town which is a marvellous retreat for shopping, dining and partying. To email the staff at the Allegro your response was immediate. The Reef lacked in any response. The Golf is inclusive which makes no sense other than to gouge for the 180 usd it cost. Unfortunately there was not much choice for golfers. The beach being our main reason to revisit was all but gone for Allegro this year while the Reef was smaller but as you walked further south the beach fronts became larger and were as colourful and clean as last year. We would not return to either for reasons stated and feel for your vacation the few extra dollars for the five star along the Playa Hotel zone to be your best bet. You want to be close to Playa for fun and experiencing the great people watching . Tulems too far and Cancun is too Americanized with all the chains.

Yes, the pool bar rest. only has a few things on the menu, great hamburgers and hot dogs, great french fries, and pizza.

Of course the RC couldn't really help this, but if you want peace and quiet, now is not the time for that here. The service was at times great but at times borderline rude! Our digital camera was stolen, we needed a flashlight to look for it because we thought we dropped it in the sand by the pool. The guy at the front desk said \"yes he had a flashlight, but no we couldn't use it\". Don't expect good service unless you tip the staff FIRST. This seemed a little backward to us. . .once we realized that that's why we seemed invisible (in the restaraunt and at the bars), we tipped them and suddenly the service improved 100%. The food was horrible, very greasy and mostly tasteless. Again I am not a picky eater, and could usually find something to fill up on, but I gained 5 lbs in a week because the only things that had taste were fattening. All of the meat seemed to be the cheapest the resort could find, as it was so tough you couldn't even cut it. Boticelli was okay but nothing to write home about. I've been to Mexico 2x before and stayed at 4 star resorts (Bahia Principe, Tulum and Melia Azul in Ixtapa), and this one is not even in the ballpark. On the plane home, my fiance set next to a couple who told him that the only reason to go to Reef Playacar is to party, everything else -----. So I'm sharing what I wish we knew beforehand. The highlights of our trip were the excursions we chose. . .Puerto Aventuras swimming with dolphins and the Mayan Ruins in Tulum/snorkeling at Akumal were awesome! We went with Olympus, a new company, and they were timely, informative and entertaining on the ruins/snorkeling trip. Oh and the lunch we ate at Puerto Aventuras (burritos) was the best food we had all week. It is nice that the hotel is 20 min walk from Playa del Carmen, but if we had it to do over, I think we'd stay in Playa del Carmen or at a different resort in Playacar. Oh one last word of caution for smokers. The other times I stayed in Mexico, you could buy a pack of Marlboro Lights at the hotels for about $2.00 us. Well everywhere we went this was still true, but you pay $4.00 us at this hotel for some reason? The housekeepers did an excellent job, we agreed that was the best service of the whole place, and we didn't even tip her until the end.

I ended up with a cold so recommend you turn off the air conditioning. Truth be told though we spent very little time in the room so who cares. Housekeeping was tardy until I tipped them $2.00 a day. Then we had prompt service a wonderful smile and towel origami on the bed each day. Isidro and Wilbert were fantastic and Isidro knows he is world famous. Some of the others are surly but most are friendly and eager to please with or without a tip. I noted the activities centre staff playing with the kids and looking like they thoroughly enjoy it. It\u2019s a great family place. The whole hotel is spotless and well maintained. Staff are constantly sweeping the grounds, cleaning and keeping the landscaping in check. The walkways weave through a jungle like setting. There was some annoying resurfacing of the walkways ongoing that made it difficult to get to your room on occasions. One security guard blocked our stumble home from the Mango bar one night but we ignored him. The food was fair to good in the main dining room but I found it cooled quickly. The Bottechelli upstairs restaurant was excellent. My only true complaint about this place and really its out of the hands of the management is the ongoing construction next door of another Riu hotel megalopolis \u2013 the beep beep and drilling starts promptly at 8am and ends at 6pm. That coupled with the insidious Mexican music that plays constantly starts to grate on your nerves. The construction is slated to end in August. I was also surprised at the lack of beach when compared to some of the photos. There has been severe erosion all along the coast. Many hotels are actively fighting with break walls of sand bags. The locals say it\u2019s the worst its ever been. The Reef is not too effected due to the reef that is on the shore in places protecting it. They have lost about 50 feet of beach but at least the buildings are not threatened like further down at other resorts. Some recommendations Take a thermal travel mug as the bar supplied cups are very small. Take a sweater for the evening its cool. The winds can be strong during the day and the undertow can be strong with pounding waves. Use caution when swimming. Ask that you pizza is done \u201ccrispy\u201d (Mexican Pizza is very good with the ample peppers). Relax and don\u2019t let things get you bent out of shape.

Construction starts at 7am and end at 7pm Monday thru saturday. You get one day to sleep in so enjoy. The hotel also gave the entire staff off for two days so there was no events all day so we had to pay to go some where else to have some activities. The only other problem was the booze, they had some which I enjoyed but once it was empty they would serve the worst or cheapest stuff they could get.

Arriving at 9:00PM at night did not allivate our fears any. The next morning after a great breakfast with good service we felt we could survive this experience. A few days into our stay not only were we surviving we were thriving. Maybe according to our clothes a little to well. The rooms there are very clean and appropriatly decorated with a Mexican theme. A bonus was the bathroom. It had a large, deep full tub, hairdryer, and make-up mirror and lights. Because of the lush vegetation on the property the rooms stayed cool all the time and we never felt the need to run the AC. Windows open with a cool breeze is a welcome treat in January. The staff there are extremely friendly and always have a Hola for you, even when they a busy. The entertainment staff is exceptional. This is the first resort where I have ever been so welcomed by this staff. They made it their business to get to know you. They always had a smile and even chatted with you when time allowed. If you were setting at the table alone at breakfast or lunch they would even join you. They always kept something going around the pool, so you had plenty to do if you chose to join. Cudos to Christine, Gabby, Maria Isabel and Xjhouljia what a joy to be around and what talented girls, they were dynamite dancers in the nightly shows. The Mango Bar is the domain of Yara, a more pleasant young lady you'll never meet. Ask her about the drink Xtaubentun or as members of our group call it the \"Nectar of the Mayan Gods\" The food was above average for a Mexican resort of this calibre, it was seasoned well unusual for most resorts, I am a picky eater and I always found something to eat. Botacelli's (the Italian restaurant) was not only good it was outstanding. I am married to an Italian who is a very good cook, and the food served there rivalled some of his. He thought they had a real Italian chef and was surprised to find out the chef was Mexican. The service there was on a parallel to much of what I have recieved in any North American establishment. The servers really seemed to like their job. I have worked in the tourist industry for 23 years, so I know something about restaruant service. If you are looking for 7 speciality restaruants and 5 buffet restraunts, acres of land, a whirlpool in your room and Las Vegas entertainment,all the commericalism of a large hotel this is not the place for you, however: if you are looking for a small resort with a real Mexican feel where you can get to know other guests and highly recommend the Reef.

One of the reasons we stayed there was because of the price and although it is rated a 4-star by Sunquest vacations, it should be rated a 3 or maybe 3+. Our arrival was uneventful as we were the only group on the bus staying at the Reef. The check-in staff were friendly and were able to give us three rooms right next to each other in building 14. Although all the rooms were ground floor rooms, they were not musty and smelled just fine. Our air-conditioning worked fine, but we never used it. The celing fan on with both windows open was perfect. The rooms themselves are on the small side, but the beds are comfortable and the bathroom is a good size. We never had problems with not getting enough hot water or towels. The weather was beautiful the entire time were were there, but the nights are cold so bring pants and a few sweaters. The hotel grounds were really beautiful; a jungle-like setting. I did look around a few of the other hotels on the strip and the atmosphere at the Reef was much nicer. There are two pools. One with the swim-up bar and shallow area for the kids and a second pool where they do the water aerobics and play water polo. For the most part the pools were clean at the beginning of the day, but people track sand and leaves and other debris into the pool and I never saw anyone cleaning the pool after early morning. The beach was beautiful the first few days of our trip, but whether it was due to strong winds or ocean currents, most of the beach had disappeared over a day or two, leaving exposed rocks and fallen palapas. Apparently they've lost about 20 meters of beach in the last year. I didn't recognize the beach from the pictures on the internet. It was quite busy the second week we were there and most of the chairs at both the beach and the pool were taken by mid-morning, but we were up about 8 am and never had a problem getting six chairs together. The people do get up early to reserve chairs, but hey, if you can't beat them, join them. I have to commend the animation staff who were always very friendly and worked long hours. The organized activities thoughout the day were okay, nothing great. It was the usual aerobics, volleyball, stretching classes. It the day activities were okay, the night ones were non-existant. This is not a place to stay if nightlife at the resort is important to you. The lobby bar, Mangos, opens around 6 pm, with a guy playing a keyboard and singing. When I first heard him I thought it was kareoke night. He was horrible. Thank goodness he only played for a couple of hours. The animation staff then hold a nightly show in the theatre at 9:30. Although the audience participation show and casino night were fun, the other shows were about the calibre of a junior high Christmas concert. Not good. After the show is done at about 10:30 people have a drink or two at the very quiet lobby bar and either head to bed or to Playa del Carmen. If you want nightlife you have to go into town. We went into town a couple of times and really enjoyed the Blue Parrot, which is about a $6.00 cab ride from the Reef. Now the food. I had read a lot of reviews about the food before I went, so I was not surprised by it. I am not a picky eater and always found enough to eat, but the buffet is small and doesn't have a lot of options. Most of the food is really greasy and either undercooked, overcooked, or cold when it's supposed to be hot. Breakfast was probably the worst meal. Thank God they cooked pancakes on the grill. We had bacon only one day. Other days they either fried up strips of ham or little mini-wieners. The omllett and egg bar looked good, depending on who was cooking. One cook basically boiled the eggs in oil, while others made great eggs. Hit and miss on that one. The bread and fruit was always good. Lunch was always much better. The grilled white fish was awesome and there was definetly more selection. The desserts were okay, nothing special, but their soft serve ice cream was really good. Another option during the day was the snack bar by the beach. They served pizzas, burgers, hotdogs, fries, wings and sandwiches. The Mexican pizza was great and were the burgers and hotdogs. They are open until 2 am so there was always somewhere to get a snack. We only ate at the buffet for dinner once and then decided to stick to Botticelli. We made reservations there almost every night and thoughoutly enjoyed it. The service was great and the food was good. We also went into Playa del Carmen a few times for dinner. The day we checked out, our bags were kept in a locked room and they offered us the use of a courtesy room for 30 minutes to shower and change before our bus came to take us to the airport. Check out was no problem. Overall, our vacation at the Reef was good and what I expected.

Food and drinks were excellent - there was more than enough of everything. The only thing we missed were fresh tomatoes. The pools and beach were OK, however the pools were a little bit dirty after the showers. The beach size (in our opinion) was not sufficient (too narrow - restricted possibilities for swimming). The other thing was the return time for towels. 5.00 PM is too early. :-( The activites carried out by the team of animators were sometimes funny, but generally too LOUD. Try to get sunbeds on the beach. It\u00b4s quiet there! Our leaflet said \"beautiful hotel with quiet atmosphere\". Well, this was not our idea of a quiet atmosphere. Overall, we have thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the Reef Club Playacar. Would go back. The only \"real\" problem came the very last morning. Our taxi was scheduled to pick us up in the hotel at 7:45 AM. We have asked the reception to give us a wake up call at 6:15 AM. Surprise, surprise - WE NEVER GOT THE WAKE UP CALL !!!!!

The pools were fine, adequate for the 300 rooms that make up the hotel, and never unpleasantly crowded, the pool bar was a nice touch. The beach was absolutely BEAUTIFUL, stunning turquoise water and safe for kids to try snorkelling, cute fish, snorkels/ boogie boards etc free to use. Recommend a scuba diving trip (booked at the beach shack) to the coral and a trip to Xcerat, cheaper to get in a taxi and pay in when you get there, the evening show is spectacular! Food was wonderful- so much variety & quality- snack bar open until late at night! Beats any European hotel we've ever stayed in. Staff were lovely on the whole, lots of character!

First of all.... DON'T use TNT Vacations!!!! They are a huge rip off, we were charged $50 per person for fuel as soon as we got to the airport (not a nice way to start your vacation) and get you to your destination 3 hours late with no compensation! All inclusive means ALL INCLUSIVE and you should not have to be surprised with a $50 fuel charge and what is supposed to be a straight flight to Cancun should not turn into a flight that stops in florida for an hour! Anyway on to the resort....After reading a lot of the reviews before going, my boyfriend and I were a little worried but once we got to the Reef, saw the resort, the room, the beach, the atmosphere, we knew that these people who complained just had a bad experience or wanted to stay at Donald Trumps Suite!!! The Reef is a 200 room resort and is very cozy, romantic and beautiful. It is set in a jungle theme, so in between the buildings as you walk, it's just beautiful greenery. Our room was on the 2nd floor closer to the beach/pool, there was NO musty smell so I didn't have to spray the room etc. The room is very clean, once in a while we saw little ants but it's Mexico and you're in a jungle... helllooo!!! the bed is a little firm but it comes in handy for your back after all of the day's activities! The maids cleaned the room everyday, we did tip a $1/$2 every other day... they work very hard and deserve it! they cleaned the rooms and outside the rooms so thoroughly in that hot weather!! The pools aren't that great, that would be my huge complaint but my boyfriend and I are \"beach people\" and didn't go in the pool more than 2 times and the beach more than makes up for it. IT IS BEAUTIFUL!!!! clear aquamarine warm water, just wonderful. A couple of days the waves got big and we got boogie boards and had so much fun riding the waves!! and there are fish that swim by which is so nice!! they don't bother anyone, if you are like my boyfriend and i and love to snorkel and see the fish, swim out to the bags in the beach to the left and take some bread with you and you will see the prettiest fish!! it's just amazing. Walk along the beach, it's nice. There are nasty women on the beach who decide to expose their breasts to everyone - they have no respect for themselves, their husband/significant other has no respect for them and they especially don't have respect for the kids around... i mean come on... any way, to each it's own! and the men next to the resort working on houses/condos have a ball gazing at them.. ha! Yes there are rude, loud and drunk Europeans and Italians. We dare not try to attempt to go into the pool bar, was very small and filled of drunk people of course. The food isn't that great but we never went hungry as a lot of people say. There is always something for you to eat at the buffet, the food at the italian restaurant is okay. On Wednesday night, the buffet had \"Mexican night\" and the food was great. We had our favorite waiter who took care of us at breakfast and lunch - his name is NERY, he is very nice, very humble and attended to us as soon as he saw us... there was also Sergio who was nice. we tipped them because we wanted to and because they deserved it. Definitely go into town, it's about a 20 mins walk or 5 min ride in a cab which cost $4. the resort also had bikes, so we used them one day and it was a nice ride into town and back to the resort. Bargain bargain bargain your life away in town. Never accept the first price. We bought tours to Tulum and Xel-ha in town which was cheaper than buying it at the resort. But next time, we will hire a cab to take us there, Tulum was only $3 per person to get in and I'm not sure how much Xel-ha was but i'm sure it would work out cheaper if you do it on your own. Xel-ha is beautiful, it's all inclusive, take money to leave as deposits for snorkel gear, towels, tube etc. they give the $ back to you when you return it. Great restaurants, it's an \"all day\" thing. Well email if you have any questions. Marja at the Reef Playacar is wonderful. Everyone there is very friendly.

I generally enjoyed my stay at the Reef with my wife and two children (ages 4 and 2). The beach is beautiful, although the surf was rough, probably b/c of nearby Hurricanes Frances and Ivan. The property itself is beautifully maintained. You will always see employees cleaning, manicuring the gardens, sweeping the beach areas, pool areas, etc. So you don't have to worry about cleanliness or resort appeal. However, the rooms left a little to be desired, though they were perfectly utilitarian. They are smaller than they appeared in the online pictures; and the quality of the furnishings/fixtures as, at best, average. Nonetheless, the rooms were clean, notwithstanding our housekeeping service, which came only twice in 5 days. Also, if you are looking for a soft cushy bed, go somewhere else. The beds are extra firm as many others have commented and my back remains a little sore 3 days after my return to the U.S. The one or two barely noticeable ants that I saw the entire week could not bother even the most squeemish traveler. The geckos greating you every night OUTSIDE of your room, however, might shock or annoy some; although they are terrified of humans and would squander out of sight at the first hand clap. Really not a big deal and you definately get used to it after the first night. As for the food.........TERRIBLE. While it is true that you won't starve, it is equally true that you cannot (and will not) enjoy any meal from start to finish. For breakfast, I stuck with having some miniature croissants and jelly; lunch was a burger from the poolside bar and dinner was whatever was edible, like the rice. Any cheese I tried (even the cheese on the pizza) was ATROCIOUS. I stayed away from the \"ethnic\" dishes entirely as they were not good at all (I'm not suggesting Mexican food is bad; in fact, it's quite delicious if you go to a restaurant like I did when I went to Cancun 6 years ago....great food!). As for Botticelli's (the non-buffet \"classy restaurant\" at the resort), it is no great shakes, but the atmosphere is beautiful and the food marginally better than the buffet. Nightly entertainment was offered for children and adults alike at the \"Jolla\". I found it pleasant and a nice end to a relaxing day at the beach and pool. Do NOT expect Las Vegas-type entertainment. Keep your expectations reasonable! The tourists at the resort were wonderful, and I was pleasantly surprised that the Europeans were very friendly to everyone, even the Americans (I had encountered incredible anti-American sentiment in my previous travels to Europe). Some women do go to the beach and pools topless, so stay in the U.S. if that bothers you. If you keep your expectations reasonable, you will enjoy yourself. If you're looking for Ritz Carlton-type luxury, go elsewhere. P.S. I didn't find the employees to be \"wonderful\" as many have said. They were, however, generally courteous and very hard-working; but there were a couple of times where even a polite request for a soft drink or a refill was made to seem like an imposition (but I must emphasize that this happened once or twice out of the hundred or so requests).", "Date": "September 13, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cWe'll be back\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2515960", "Content": "8-29-2004 to 9-4-2004 Room was great (3rd floor), beach was beautiful, staff went above and beyond, loved all of the guests especially the international ones that were not afraid to discuss the world/politics and the food well ....

To top that it was leaking all night. We had a trash can and several glasses collecting water. I will have to admit that when I called maintenance, they were very prompt in repairing the leak. It still didn't cool very well. The walls and doors are paper thin and the four nights we were there I was never able to sleep through the night without being woke up several times. Talk about irritating. The staff was hit and miss. Some were very pleasant and helpful but more seemed to be indifferent to our presence there. The bar literally SUCKED!!! If you like to drink, this is not the place for you!!! There was very little assortment in choices of beverages. I know we were in Mexico but you would think the amount of Americans through there they would stock their bars a little better. If you are a Crown drinker like myself, you are out of luck at this place. I could count the number of bottles at the bar on both of my hands. It was not easy getting drinks either. The bars were understaffed 98% of the time. The food was typical Mexico. It seemed the same to me as the five star foods. Mexico foods seem very bland to me. With the exception of the Italian restraunt, my wife hated the food. She did like the Italian though. The beach was very nice. It was clean and I have to concur on the number of topless women there. I was kinda suprised at a family hotel that they would allow it. I know myself and my boys didn't mind though!

SOME of them were less than interested in helping and more concerned with getting their stuff returned in an hour (or they'll charge you $$$). I liked the Italian restaurant, but service is very slow. It took us nearly two hours to complete a meal. Mostly waiting for the next course...while surviving on a few crusts of bread. But, the food was excellent. One does have to reserve early for the restaurant as it is the only TRUE restaurant at the resort...and it books up fast. The buffet was decent but the food was pretty much the same thing every night. Not one of the eight of us ever felt ill. Our room was acceptable, and was always cleaned well. We found towel animals on our bed everyday, but most were wild and would run before we could pet them. The shows....forget it. Seriously, they were BAD, only a Texan could find entertainment value at all (joking, friend). I'm giving the place four stars due to the efforts of most of the staff. The people at the bottom are doing their jobs well, and were friendly and seemed genuinely interested in making our stay a nice one (other than the water activities shack). Management, I'd suggest, should look at the shows they put on, the people getting turned away from the Itialian restaurant while others sit too long for a meal, and make some changes.

We had the same waiters at the restaurant everyday and they were extremely nice and accomodating people, imagine having a table ready for 16 people all the time?? which they did in a matter of seconds....we were sad that we didn't say our goodbyes to Neri, one of our waiters in the evenings......we hope that he did get our thank you envelope??? he always had a smile on his face....Martin in the mornings was great too. They really go out of their way for you!!!! We went to the Italian restaurant once and that was good too, but like many people have noted, we had no problem finding good stuff to eat at the buffet restaurant. They have themed nights so their menu does change.....Mexican Fiesta night, with Mariachi and all sorts of Mexican dishes, Caribbean night , Gala night...etc. Our room was close to the pool, the higher the number the closer you are to the beach/pool. We had no problem with anything negative that has been written about the rooms.....there was definitely no bad smell, the water did smell weird the first day but it went away, we always had hot water, which I think I'm the only one that used it in my group, everybody wanted cool water. We were in room 0922 and it seemed to be slightly bigger than the other rooms our friends had, but they had no complaints either..... The people at the reception desk were very helpful to us. I called them the morning of the day were checking in and requested a room close to the beach and on the second floor and when we got there....everything was ready for all of us with rooms in the first and second villas close to the pool.....Thank you Vianey!!!. The pictures on their website are not an exageration of the beauty of the hotel, I actually think it was more beautiful than it is portrayed..... For those of you going there.....don't worry, you will have a great time, have an open mind and just relax and like other people have said, treat the people that work there with respect and they will give you more in return.

The grounds are very unique with lots of lush vegitation and beautiful night lighting. We were very impressed by how hard the staff worked at keeping the resort clean and well maintained, and by how pleasant and curtious all of the staff members were. The pool bartenders worked extremely hard (Feliciano & Herme) and did a great job getting our drinks to us quickly (uno mas Rum Runner por favor!). Definitely bring your own mugs. The only negatives were: 1.) For the first 4 nights we were unfortunate enough to be staying in the same building as a group of young 20 somethings from the Boston area who were extremely loud and disrespectful at night (early mornings) on their way back to their rooms from nights out on the town. 2.) A foul, sulphur smell from the water out of our shower and sink on at least half the days we were there. 3.) A disappointing night at the Italian restaurant where they were obviously short handed and we waited quite a long time just to get our order taken. The food was good (better than the buffet) but not extraordinary. The other nights we ate there the service was much better. Other than those minor issues we had a great time and would recommend this resort to anybody who wants to have a wonderful time at an inexpensive all-inclusive, who's not expecting luxury accomodations or gourmet food. One last note in rebuttal to the review from Boulder CO on June 30th. My wife and I are experienced divers as well (my wife being a PADI Divemaster) and although we witnessed the morning SCUBA demos, we could never actually hear everything the instructor was saying but I find it very hard to believe that Van (the morning dive instructor) would try to \"entice novices out on the water\" without proper training and supervision strictly for money's sake. And to say he is \"very clearly not a safe instructor\" is outrageous (bordering on defamation of character). Those comments could only come from someone who never actually dove with Van. Because if they did (as we did on 2 wonderful dives, Mama Vina wreck & Tortugas) they would quickly realize that although Van is a very \"gung-ho\" & enthusiastic instructor who loves his job, he is also extremely safety conscious, well prepared, and provided us a very in-depth and detailed pre-dive briefing before we left. I would have no problems recommending the very knowledgeable and professional staff at the Reef Club dive shop. (thanks for all your help Van, Alex, and Margaret!) P.S.

Yes. After reading all of those bad reviews, I had nightmares for weeks prior to our stay. Did any of them come true? No! We were there the week of the June 27th thru July 1. Not long enough. From the moment we arrived at the hotel, things were top notch. We were greeted nicely. We got a wonderful room. We were in room 1013, right next to the pool area and food places. Great view. The entire resort was placed amongst a jungle atmosphere. Everywhere you walked, you were surrounded by jungle plants and animals. If anyone sees that funny looking little creature that's a cross between a rat, rabbit or whatever, let us know what it is. Iguanas too. We got our picture made with them. Don't miss out on that! The beds were firm, but not too hard. We had taken our own pillows, but found no real need for them. We actually left one behind. Room freshener, we took it too, not needed. Always had hot water for the shower. We took two per day. We never wanted for anything in the room. We did leave a couple of dollars on the bed for the maid a couple of times. We got a towel animal made by one of the guys. It was our anniversary and we got a nice note left in our room also. Even though it was only our 3rd anniversay, the note stated we had been married for 10. So what. It was comical. Truly, the thought is what mattered. The food was adequate. You must let Rori fix you an omelet for breakfast. Yum! We ate at Bonicelli's once. It was nice. The snack bar had good food too. The drinks? Well, let me put it to you this way, some were heavy on the alcohol, some weren't. Nevertheless, I believe there are times during the past few days, I still can't remember things. What does that tell you? Believe me, take a nice big insulated mug! They WILL fill it and do it kindly. They seemed to like them. We got a lot of comments about them. We were surprised though to not see others with this idea. Their glasses are about 6 ounces. That's ok if you don't drink much. We had 32 oz. mugs. There were 4 of us. None of us went thirsty, for anything! These guys work very hard day and night. You see them taking care of the grounds from dawn till dusk. When you see all of the jungle greens, you'll know why. They scrub the walkway down too. You've always got a great view as you walk around. You definitely know you're in Mexico. It's the real \"enchilada\". Bugs? Oh we saw a few itty bitty ants in the room, but hey, I felt at home. Nothing else. Be prepared for not getting american money back in change. They say they don't have it. So you end up with a lot of pesos. This was practically everywhere we went, even off the resort property. We made sure towards the end of the trip to pay as much as possible with pesos, and exact change. It's ok to come home with a small bit for a souvenier, but not a lot. We met many people from all over. Nice people. Never had any issues with loud, obnoxious guests. The beach is the most beautiful ever. You get great views from the top of the bar and restaurant. Take advantage of the moon at night. The weather was perfect the entire week. Warm, sunny and clear skies. If you don't know how to sail, you need to take a lesson and go out. It is awesome. That's part of what you're paying for anyway. I'm aware that resorts have their moments. There may be problems at times with things, but that's life. Believe me, I was looking for all of those bad things I'd read about. I was waiting for \"bad\" to happen, it just didn't.

We were there for 10 days, June 17-27. Strictly speaking, this is a 4 star hotel, but we marked 5 stars because we had a 5 star experience. We\u2019ve traveled to places such as the Maui Four Seasons and the Maui Fairmont Kea Lani, where we vacationed like rock stars, but we had every bit as much a good time at the Reef Club at a fraction of the price. The all-inclusive feature removed a lot of stress from our vacation. We are a family of four, with 2 children, ages 4 and 9. The rooms were basic, but clean and nice. The staff was responsive\u2026we only had 2 towels in our room at first, but after we asked for 4, we got what we asked for. Our room didn\u2019t smell musty at all; in fact housekeeping had placed a room deodorizer in the room, and we asked for them to stop leaving it in. I suspect that the management had read the reviews, and was trying to be responsive to the Internet complaints about smell. The beds are very firm, even with the foam \u201cegg-crate\u201d on top of the mattress. The staff worked so hard, and I thought that they were very nice. Feliciano was great at the pool bar and Pedro also at the bar next to the snack area. The entertainment staff members at the pool (step- and water-aerobics, water volleyball and polo, etc.) were excellent, fun, and enthusiastic. We liked the food. It was very typical of the food you might get in a nice upper class Mexican household, but for those who expect tacos, burritos and enchiladas, it might not have been as expected. As you can imagine, in Mexico families don\u2019t eat burritos and enchiladas every night. The salsas at the snack bar and main restaurant were excellent. The snack bar was great for those hanging out at the pool. Boticelli\u2019s should be experienced for the change of pace from the dinner buffet fare. The first few days we were there, a group of young men from Merida (about 4 hours inland from Playa) were at the hotel, celebrating their high school graduation. They were nice boys, and it was fun to see them celebrate. We found them to be perfect gentlemen who made a genuine friendship with our son. Although some had rooms adjacent to ours, we did not begrudge them their good time. One of the reviewers mentioned that the upper pool might have been warmer because of the people at the bar. The truth is that the pool is overall shallower than the sports pool, which is why it was warmer (heats up faster). Two broad areas of the upper pool were only a few inches deep (for sunning while in the water) and the upper pool was connected to the \u201chot tub\u201d (by shape only) and kids pool section. It was a pleasure to see such a diverse cultural mixture. I would say that greater than 50% of the guests were European and Mexican, and we heard so many languages spoken. What is vacation for but to meet new people with diverse experiences and cultures. We made friendships with folks from Holland and the UK. If you don\u2019t want to be exposed to different cultures and customs, then you shouldn\u2019t travel internationally. Even as a US mom, I wasn\u2019t offended by any of the European topless sunbathers. It was nice to have the opportunity to talk with my children about the practices of different cultures. On a serious note, we caution against anyone trying scuba diving without a fully sanctioned course (NAUI or PADI). As a common practice at many beach resorts, the morning scuba demonstrations at the pool are safe, but are being used to entice novices out on the water for underwater experiences and \u201cresort certifications\u201d (at cost) for their first time. As VERY experienced divers (my husband is a research diver of over 20 years), this is an extremely dangerous practice and the gung-ho instructor is very clearly not a safe instructor. If you want to dive, do yourself a favor and earn your certification through a PADI or NAUI course in your area before hitting the tropics. Your check-out dives can be done safely in Mexico, but I would not recommend the dive shop at the Reef Club (by affiliation only).

This hotel has cool looking hut roofs that really blends with the beachy paradise atmosphere. The room units are beautiful looking from the outside and nice on the inside.

The lockers were so small you could barely get a backpack in, and they charged you $2 for it. We left after 2 hours because we couldn't get our snorkeling gear into the locker. The place looks wonderful from the brochures, but it isn't once you get there. SAVE your money and go to XEL-HA instead. It was $56 and it includes EVERYTHING!!! Free lockers, towels, snorkeling equipment, FOOD and DRINKS. They had many different restaruants there each with a different menu, and it was ALL FREE! This place is worth your money. The snorkeling was so much better, the whole place is made for snorkeling. At Xcaret the snorkeling place was a little strip that took only 5 minutes to snorkel-that was it. We did a cenote dive with Hidden Worlds and were very pleased with their safety procedures. The guide had double everything and they only took 4 people at a time. I wouldn't do the cenotes with any other company. Didn't see anyone else that had redunant equipment like they did in case of an emergency. It was beautiful. Dove with Playa Scuba in Playa del Carmen. Unless you are experienced, like we are, they are not very concerned about safety. They had some girls on our dive that had only made one other ocean dive. The divemaster never said to indicate when you were down to so much air and even told us that we didn't have to make a safety stop if we didn't want to when the dive was 55-60 feet. It was a drift dive and two of the girls got carried away and the divemaster didn't notice for about 4 minutes and then wanted them to swim against the current to him. Needless to say he had to go after them and bring them back.

They were always smiling and always made sure we were ok for the 45 minute van ride to the resort. We had to wait around at the van for about an hour before we left the airport though- waiting for other vacation-goers to get there. The hotel staff - at the front desk - called us by name when we approached the desk around 10pm- which was comforting. The resort staff members were so delightful to be around. Two male employees- one from Mexico City and a cute blonde from Canada asked if they could join us for breakfast one morning. My friend and I were not into the activities , but just to relax in the shaded hammocks and swim in the ocean. The swim up bar was great. The bartenders were the best I have encounterd (Feliciano) and kept the refills (frozen amaretto sours) coming without asking!! Now there was the man that fell from the 2nd floor balcony... We saw the railing the next day, and in MY opinion, the staff should have removed the yellow CAUTION tape from the area. It looked more like a crime scene for several days - than just an unfortunate accident. The resort itself was nice- looked like a rainforest inside. I just loved the 'kissing chairs' throughout the walkways. The rooms were comfortable and the bathroom was roomy- big tub. The housekeeping kept the bottled water stocked for us- ours did not have a price on them- and we drank all 10 that were supplied. They did try to stick us with that $10- but we refused since they weren't marked. I don't recommend the Italian restraunt though. The atmosphere was great- like a 5star place- all fancy - but the food was drab. All the pasta sauce on the menu was tomato based- no alfredo or garlic butter sauce. Was more like a tv dinner to me.

Keep in mind that although the shack says \"Reef\" on it, it does not belong to the hotel. 2)When requesting a receipt for a taxi trip to Cancun for medical reimbursement reasons, the management at the front desk told me that the driver would be back the next day (the driver would need to go to the 'office' and return)only to find out from another management staff that this would be impossible as there is no such 'office'. I'm not sure why someone in that position would lie to me. 3)Articles of clothing along with shoes were missing from my son's room. 4)The railing on the second floor of a person in our group broke resulting in him falling.

Also, the snack bar by the pool was messy, and consisted of the same fatty, unhealthy foods every day. 2. BOTTICELLI - This one restaurant is fantastic. If you wake up at 7 AM and make your reservations for that day you will be pleased. The staff is kind and hospitable. Make sure you have the chocolate cake. Also, you can eat here every night if you choose. I recommend this since the buffet is, well, awful... 3. FRONT DESK STAFF - Very rude. Unhelpful. Lazy. You can check out later than NOON for $10 an hour although I am convinced that the staff just pockets the cash. Also, some with advise you of this option and other staff members don't. 4. DRINKS - Stick to beer. Everything else is just drink mix and water. 5. TIPPING - Although an all inclusive, I noticed that tipping is acceptable. 6. BEACH STAFF - The waiter, Isidro, is excellent. 7. BUGS - We had 3 bugs in our room the first night. One was a roach. We called housekeeping for bug spray.

Now to the Reef Club...if you can get a room on the third floor of certain bulidings that have the large balcony and hot tub and a great view, lucky you and lucky us because one of our 2 rooms were these. The inside of all rooms are fairly standard but very clean and well maintained. The grounds at the Reef Club are awesome! It's a jungle like setting very peaceful and beautiful to look at and walk through. The food at the buffet was fairly standard but good none the less. The Italian restuarant is also good and I have found that you do not need to get up at 7am to make reservations you can do it any time of the day. The beach area is what sets this place apart from other places. It is uncrowded, clean, plenty of loungers (no getting up early to stake your claim!) drink service is very prompt on the beach and the activities crew are always doing something but they are not pushy and there is no loud music blaring. The Reef club has 2 pools one with a swim up pool bar. Both pools are very clean and uncrowded and again plenty of loungers, go ahead, sleep in there will be plenty of chairs when you get out there! The service is up there with any 5 star hotel! The employees work 12 hour days for minimal pay. Even though this is an all-inclusive resort, please tip accordingly, these people deserve it!

We were there from April 3-10. We had an absolutely wonderful time! Mind you, we are not picky people and do not have high expectations. Our main concern is a good beach, good service, average food, and cleanliness. We picked the Reef because it was a small resort and we were not disappointed. We landed in Cancun at 12:30 and we were in our room by 2:00. You will probably get in a long line for customs that seems to go on forever. Don't be discouraged because it goes very fast. Beware of people trying to sell you time shares and so on when you get off the plane. They are everywhere. We were immediatley approached by a women who had a shirt on that said Tourist Information. So, we thought she was working for the government tourism agency. WRONG! She led us over to a desk and began to give us some good info., but within 5 mins. she was talking about a time share. We immediately walked away, and were approached by at least 10 more people. So, when you get through customs, ignore everyone and get your own luggage. They have carts for $3.00 if you need them. We were hooked up w/ Lomas Travel to get a shuttle to the resort and were told to look for people that had tourquoise shirts that had the Lomas loggo on them. Once you leave the airport and walk outside to get the shuttle, you will see the travel representatives and desks. ONLY TALK TO THEM. COMPLETELY IGNORE THE OTHERS, DO NOT EVEN SAY HOLA. It is extremely difficult to get away from them even if you give them eye contact. Once in the air conditioned van it was a 45 minute ride to the Reef. We had no trouble at the front desk and were in our room within 10 minutes of arriving. We stayed in 8 12. It was in an excellent location because it was a 2-3 minute walk to the food, pools, and beach. I had requested a oceanview room over a month ago, but because there are so few of them, there weren't any available. Initially I was disappointed, but I was pleasantly surprised with the patio that faced the beautiful jungle setting. Also it was covered which was nice the couple of nights it rained. The room had a king sized bed and was very spacious. I don't know how anyone can complain about the rooms. They have nice tile floors, a spacious marble and tile bathroom with big tub, blow dryer, magnified makeup mirror attached to the wall and ample shelf space. Playacar area was working on the power system that week and the electric went out 3 times for a few hours. It affected all the resorts in the area. Candles came in handy. After the power came back on, the water ran murky for a short period, but cleared up right away. Actually, we found the water to have no smell and was soft. Once in awhile it ran cool, but that felt good after being on the beach all day. There is a huge mirrored closet with a shelving unit, desk and chair, small table and two chairs, two end tables with lamps, lights over the bed and a decent sized t.v. with CNN, HBO and other channels in English. The room was on the first floor and was musty smelling when we first arrived, but we cranked up the air conditioning and the smell got better. Here's a tip, bring a couple of fragrant candles with you. Whenever you are in the room, light them. It helps with the smell and gives the room a romantic glow. The room was dark because it is shady all around the area, but we didn't mind that. We were rarely in the room. It was SPOTLESS everyday. I'm a clean freak and I was impressed with the cleanliness. Even the corners were clean. Yes, the bed was hard, but I slept fine and I'm used to a feather bed. Another tip, if you have down pillows at home, roll them up to get the air out and shove in a ziplock bag. I carried mine in my carry on bag and was glad I did. The pillows are hard. My husband said he didn't want to bring his pillow and he regretted it. No bugs anywhere except a few on the patio. Believe me, I checked my bed every night and never found one. I tipped the maid $2.00 everyday and she did a good job. Bottled water is availbale from the maid and is $1.00. We asked for two a day and the cost was added to our bill at the end. Just leave your empty bottles by your tip and the maid will replace them. I called the front desk for an iron and ironing board and w/in 10 minutes a maid brought one which I kept in the room all week. There is a safe deposit box in the closet. To use, go to the front desk to get the lock. It's $2.00 a day. The resort is beautiful. The ground are immaculate and gorgeous. Whoever designed the place did a wonderful job. Lighted pathways meander through the tropical settings. Birds are singing in the trees, Mexican music is constantly played in faux stone speakers along the pathway. Very romantic. The pools are nice and well maintainenced. The pool bar is heavenly. Nothing like sitting in the water, having a frozen drink (try the Conga, Blue Logoon, Mudslide) and looking at the gorgeous water. I have never seen water with so many shades of blue! The beach is lovely, and there are a lot of comfortable loungers. It is a good idea to reserve a chair in the morning if you are going during a busy season. Good activities for the younger set. I'm 44 and just like to relax by the beach, but younger people were having a great time with the activity staff. It was breezy while we were there and the waves were terrific. So much fun!! There was nothing like being in a clear blue warm ocean with rolling waves washing over you. Heavenly!!! The food at the snack bar was good. Always had fries, hot dogs, hamburgs, desserts, tortilla chips and the best guacamolie and salsa I've ever had. Sometimes roast chickens and chicken fingers. Every afternoon I had a big plate of guacamolie with salsa and jalepenos on top with chips. MMMM. The buffet was good. We never had a problem finding something to eat. Try their poached eggs in a greenish and reddish sauce. They don't look too appetizing, but are very good. Their cheesecake is excellent, but not always available. Their mango was great and the rest of the fruit was good too. The Italian rest. was excellent. We ate there 3 times. Each time was delicious. The drinks were fine, be sure to bring an insulated cup because the cups they provide don't appear to be washed well. Drinks seemed good to me. But I wasn't there to get wasted. Service everywhere was great and it was a busy week. Try laying in the hammocks in the morining or early evening when it's not too hot. It is so relaxing. There is entertainment every night. We went twice. The Mayan dancers are not to be missed - they were so good. We took a tour to Xal-Ha/Talum. It was excellent We booked it at the resort. For $98. you go to Xal-Ha (lagoon water park w/ great snorkeling) from 9:30-2:00. There you get free snorkeling rental (the snorkel is new and you keep it), all you can eat and drink at 5 restaurants which are all good. We ate at a Mexican rest. that was terrific. What a beautiful place Xal-Ha is. We did a diving thing where you put this 55 lb. helmet over your head and go 11 ft. under the water. At first we tried to get out of it cause we paid $80.00 and had already seen so many fish while snorkeling, but they wouldn't let us cancel. Well, we're glad we did it. It was a blast!!! The helmet lets you breathe regularly and is almost weightless in the water. They have guides who walk you along this railing underwater and you see these huge fish. They hold a stingray so you can pet it; that was cool. Then the stingray kept swimming by my legs. It liked me. Defiinitley worth the money. I could have spent all day at Xal-Ha, but felt I should see the ruins. The ruins were interesting. Our tour guide was Mayan and was a wealth of information. We also took the ferry over to Cozumel. All the ferries are $18. round trip. We rented a jeep and toured the island. Bring snorkeling equipment if you have it. There are national parks to snorkel at around the island. I suggest renting a vehicle from a reputable international co. As soon as you get off the ferry men will accost you to rent a vehicle. We went w/ the first guy who had pictures of the vehicles. He said he had a Jeep. Well, 5 blocks later we went to the parking lot and the jeep was a beat-up Tracker. And they would only took cash. We left that place and found Avis, Hertz, and Executive all on the same street. We felt most comfortable w/ Executive and rented a nice Jeep for 75.00 including insurance. When you get off the ferry walk straight down the road, go 2 blocks and you will see Avis, Hertz, and Executive. Go to a restaurant on the other side of the Island. It is called something Rios and is an authentic restaurant right on the beach. It was excellent. Great margaritas and seafood. Playa del Carmen is a short walk or taxi ride into town ($4.00) one way. Terrific shopping, atmosphere and food. Try La Karen's at night for good atmosphere and free entertainment. Shopping off the side streets of 5th Ave. is more reasonable than on 5th. You can haggle better. Try turning LEFT out of the resort and walking five mins. to a shopping center. Nice shops, but not as good of prices as in town. They don't haggle much. Go to the small jewelry store inside the courtyard with all the cultured pearls in the window. I got a beautuifu pink cultured pearl necklace/earring set for $20. and another set of pink, white, black pearls for $40. The price of gold and diamonds is ridiculous everywhere, though silver is a bargain. The airport departure was a breeze for USAir. We were checked through everything within 1/2 hour. I highly recommend the Reef if you are upbeat, go with the flow people who are not there to find every little thing wrong with the place.

Like others who have posted on this site, we were somewhat concerned about what we would find at the Reef. We need not have worried. Our shuttle bus from the airport dropped us off at the front lobby area of the Reef around 2:00 pm, and our room was ready and waiting for us. Check in was a breeze, and the gal at the front desk looked like a Spanish version of Janis Joplin, friendly and smiling, but with a gravelly voice and hair everywhere. Our room looked exactly like the one pictured on the Reef website, and was well appointed, clean and tidy. Yes, there is an odour that you'll notice each time you enter your room, an earthy, feculent aroma. My wife said it smelled like one of my windys, but I was reminded of the way my uncle's shoes smell on a rainy day. He's 82. The grounds of the Reef maintain the Mexican jungle theme, with exotic vegetation bordering the walkways. Be sure to keep an eye out for the little agoutis that live in the underbrush. You'll see them scampering around, looking for seeds and berries. I almost got a photo of one of them engaging in the peculiar practice of coprophagy, a practice common to most rodents, but I just wasn't quick enough with my camera. Paved pathways lead from the rooms down to what surely is one of the most beautiful beaches in the whole area. The Reef is truly a little slice of paradise. During the week we were there (March 21 to 28), the Reef was booked solid. At times it felt a bit crowded. And it was necessary to get down to the beach no later than 8:00 am to drape a towel over a beach chair and stake a claim, otherwise we wouldn't have any place to sit. One strange experience we had - each morning a large red headed man would shuffle onto the beach, toss his flipflops by his already claimed beach chair, and then wade out into the warm waters of the Caribbean ocean. He'd wade out to about waist level, then squat down so the water was at his neck. Then, for 15 or 20 minutes he'd just sit there, often times frowning and gritting his teeth. He looked like he might have been in pain. Then, suddenly, he'd get a big, satisfied grin on his face, stand up and wade back up onto the beach and plop down in his beach chair. I guess he was doing some type of aquatic Deepak Chopra meditation. The strange thing is that he would yell at his 3 kids for the rest of the morning, telling them to stay the hell out of the water until the tide went out. Weird. Food is always a topic of contention at an all inclusive resort. I know it wouldn't satisfy the French, but I thought the food was not bad. There was a decent selection at the buffet, with wonderful fresh fruit and breads. During our one week stay, I gained 6 pounds. And be sure to go for at least one meal at Boticellis, the Italian a la carte restaurant. We ate there twice, and enjoyed the food. But stay away from the garlic shrimp. I ordered this dish the day before we left, and I came down with the \"thin dirties\". I lost 4 of the 6 pounds that I had gained. Not a fun experience. One of the strong features of the Reef Club is its proximity to the delightful town of Playa del Carmen. You can walk there in about 15 minutes. Take a stroll along 5th Avenue. It's a pedestrian friendly open air shopping venue, loaded with restaurants and stores and sidewalk cafes. In front of Senior Frog's there's this charming Mexican fellow who has a chair you can sit in, and he'll take a Q-tip dipped in mineral oil and swab out your ears for you. He charges $3.00 per ear, or $5.00 for both ears - a heck of a deal. After splashing around in the ocean, it sure feels good to have your ears cleaned out, believe me. My wife and I did find the drinks at the Reef to be watered down. Back in Canada, I can knock back 7 or 8 drinks before I start seeing double. One night at the Reef I guzzled 14 margaritas (my wife was keeping track, damn her), and was still able to smoke a cheap Mexican cigar without setting my hairpiece on fire. So, definately, the drinks are watered. Mind you, I was blind in my left eye the next day until almost noon, but I think that was due to the cheap cigar rather than the 14 margaritas. Like others have recommended, do bring your own mugs to the reef. If you like to drink a lot, you'll save time and frustation by having your own mug. In conclusion, the Reef is a good, economical resort. Nothing super fancy, but if you don't have real high expectations, you won't be disappointed.

Walkways were swept every day. I jokingly told my husband that the hotel must be trying to impress me because they now how much I appreciate cleanliness.The food was excellent.

The food at the buffet was okay, but definitely make reservations at the Italian restaurant! The snack bar was pretty good and the guacamolie was excellent!

Cancun was fun, but way too many people etc. for us. We'd been there once with our daughther, but wanted to try it on our own. Anyway, we got to the Reef Club about 1:30 pm, they told us we couldn't check in yet so right away I'm thinking \"Oh great, they overbooked and are going to send us somewhere else.\" I decided I wasn't going anywhere! About 3 minutes later they came and got us and checked us in (sigh of relief) but our room wasn't ready. So we went down to the pool area and got a drink, went back to the room after about 1/2 an hour and it was ready. There were flowers all over the bed, swans (towels) with flowers, flowers in the bathroom! It was like whoa, this is cool! About 5 minutes after we got into our room, someone knocks on the door, it was room service with a bottle of champagne on ice with glasses. The server congratulated us on our honeymoon. Well, we've been married almost 18 years, so we were not sure what the deal was. I kept thinking \"Oh no we got someone else's room. About 5 more minutes pass, and I'm out on the deck looking at the beautiful jungle that is in the center of the grounds, and another knock at the door. I let Jeff get it. It was one of the hostessess with 2 t shirts for us, and to enjoy our honeymoon. That was very cool. It turns out that our travel agent ( who happens to be my closest friend) put on our itinerary that it was a second honeymoon for us. So either that's what they do for second honeymoons, or they misunderstood. The Reef club has beautiful grounds, well kept. The jungle path that you walk to get to the pool beach etc. is sooooo gorgeous!! The staff are all (most all ) very friendly. Yara in the Mango Lounge is so sweet! She was teaching us Spanish, very patiently! And Olegario at the pool bar is GREAT! We nicknamed him Smiley cuz of the huge grin he always has on his face. Yes we tipped, but that's how we are. Boticelli's Italian Restaurant was VERY good. It has a slightly different menu everynight. But the service there was fabulous and the food was great! Yes, you have to get down there by about 7:15 to get a reservation, but get up and watch the sunrise, have some coffee then go back to bed if you want! The food in the buffet was fine. It's buffet food, not meant to be fine cuisine. And of course you'll get tired of it, but go out and eat a couple times. El Chino on 4th & 15th is awesome! Garlic shrimp, 65 pesos!!! The beach is really nice, plenty big enough, and you can walk for a long way in either direction. It does tend to feel like a freeway sometimes with all the people out walking, but it was really nice. The rooms were very nice, used the safe and had no problems. We did discover (no discrimination intended here) that the rooms were done Much better when we had a female housekeeper vs a male. The pools were nice. (Except the people who's kids wouldn't quit splashing at the pool bar - control your children, people.) We had a really great time at the Reef. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Reef.

At first, I was not happy but went along with the program. They took us to the Reef Club Cocoa Beach which they said was a five star. On the way there we were driving through some pretty rough areas and old dirt roads and I was thinking..\"5star??\", But when we got there it was very nice. Still not quite a five star but very nice. We tried to stay there for the rest of the trip so as to not have to up and move but they too were overbooked. Ended back up at the Reef Playacar and had a blast. Boticelli's is worth getting up in the morning for reservations. The Buffet was good but it did get old after a week. We did go out to eat a couple of times. The grounds were beautiful and the employees were great too. If your looking for a nice place to go and enjoy the beautiful sand and water, good food, lots of drinks and great people, this is a must.

The Reef Club is OK, but travelers there shouldn't be surprised if they experience the following: 1. Haphazard room maintenance. The knob on my air conditioner in my room broke on day one, and the only way to use it was to either plug it in, or pull the plug. It took four days of going to the front desk before it was fixed. I also had a light bulb burn out that blew all the lights in my room, and luckily I had seen the breaker box on my way in. However, it took two days to get a new light bulb. I also had to go ask for a TV remote control, but that only took one day. I tried to get a different room, but was told each day to come back tomorrow. Since I was on vacation, I just stuck it out because I wanted to be on the beach, not in the manager's office. 2. Stinky water in the bathroom. When you turn on the shower, don't be surprised if the odor gags you. I was traveling with a large group, and we were spread throughout the resort. Everyone had this problem. It didn't help to run the water hoping it would improve. And don't be surprised if you don't have hot water once in a while. 3. Rock hard beds and pillows. 4. Tiny red ants in the bathroom. I just sprayed hair spray on them, and that either killed them or just glued them in place, but one of my friends had them get into her prescription medication, and they ate it! She had to find a pharmacy and luckily found a Mexican equivalent. The hotel did have an exterminator spray several buildings, but from what I heard, it didn't help. 5. The fitness room is really in need of an update, or at least new machines. The ones there are pretty rusty, and don't appear to be too safe. Luckily walking on the beach and swimming don't require any fancy equipment. All of that said, the beach is beautiful and the water was much less rough than Cancun. My friends and I swam or played in the water daily and had a blast. We never had problems getting chairs on the beach. The pools are also very nice and clean. Depending on your maid, you may find clever towel sculptures in your room each day (elephants, flowers, swans, etc.) And we found the quality of service by the bartenders, food servers, etc. to be outstanding. All were very pleasant, hardworking and personable. The jungle setting is nice, but for a landlocked midwesterner, I really like having an ocean view and going to sleep at night hearing the surf. If you want that, you won't like the Reef. I've read a lot of reviews that focus on the food. It did get pretty repetitious after a week, but the Italian restaurant was great (that chocolate cake is wonderful), and the grill had great burgers and fries. The chocolate ice cream in the restaurant was also very good, but sometimes the beef left a lot to be desired. I would have liked more local cuisine, but an all-inclusive needs to cater more to the masses. The town itself is a fun visit, and you can find some good shopping bargains and excellent, inexpensive food if you know where to look. I'd pass on the mall - the town has a lot more to offer.

Overall our vacation was great, but we were not overlly impressed with the Reef Club itself. The grounds are beautiful - very clean with the landscaping hand trimmed every day! The pool area is nice and the beach is great. The location to Playa is great as well - only a 15 minute walk away. It's all these things that might have given it a 4-star rating, but there were some obvious places they cut corners and it's more realisitc to consider it a 3-star resort. We arrived late our first night and the grounds are very confusing when you first get there - it would be helpful if we could have gotten a 5 minute tour at the very least. Many reviews state that the food was ok, but I think the food could be considered 'bad' - 'ok' is an understatement. We tried to find something we liked, but everything was extremely bland. Also, items that were supposed to be hot were room temperature at best sometimes. My husband had an omlette every morning, but the line was extremely long. They only have one cook at the omlette grill and I was usually done eating my breakfast before he even sat down. Dinner and lunch was just as bland. The italian resturant is much better, but just like everyone says, you must wake up very early to make reservations (but worth the early wake-up). I overheard many other guests saying the same thing about the food so I know it wasn't just us. When you pay for all-inclusive, you expect the food to be better. I found the snack bar to be ok, but the bartenders were not very friendly and again, the grill line took a long time given they only had one person working it. It was apparent they cut back on serving staff right along with the quality of their food to save costs. I also have to agree that the beds & pillows were extremely hard -much worse than any motel I've ever stayed at. I too got a rash that was similar to what was described in another review. I think it might be heat rash, but we'll see how it progresses now that I'm home - hopefully it wasn't bed or beach bugs!!! We recommend you walk into town rather than riding the bikes. The bikes are very rickety and we found ourselves concentrating on riding them safetly rather than enjoying our trip to downtown. The rooms are very musty, but what can you expect given you're in a very humid climate. There was some sewer smells that came and went, but it wasn't constant and it was typically always in the same area. The good news is we never got sick (always a fear when you go to Mexico). We drank the water from the bars & resturants and were fine. We also brushed our teeth with the water in the room and never had a problem, however we don't recommend drinking it straight from the tap. Overall we enjoyed our vacation, but will probably not return to the Reef Club. Its fine if you're going to Mexico for the beach and don't care about your room or food given your budget. However, the food was the deal breaker for us!

Finally after two nights in our assigned rooms and several conversations with Front Desk staff and our travel company representative, we were moved to rooms where everything worked. Rooms are nothing ultra fancy, but perfecly fine when you consider the Reef Club is rated a 4-star resort. Did not notice the strong musty smell that many have mentioned, nor did we see any bugs. And yes, pillows and beds are hard! But nothing we couldn't live with. After room change, we then began to see the delightful side to a smaller, more personal resort. No waiting in line to eat, get a drink, or enjoy evening entertainment. Pools aren't huge, but plenty big enough and sparkling clean. There were always plenty of chairs around the pool. No need to run out at 7:00 a.m. to put towels on chairs to save! The beach and water are terrific. Grounds are very pretty and so well kept. Drinks good and plenty big enough. Only reason I did not give Reef Club a 5-star rating is because of the food. As many of you have said, it is just OK. Not terrible, but certainly not in the excellent category. But we always managed to find something we liked and had more than enough to eat. Botecelli Restaurant is very nice and worth at least a couple of nights for dinner there.

If you don't think they are big enough, order 2 at a time or simply bring a insulated mug with you. They had no problem filling them up. If you think the drink is weak, order a shot to pour in it. I found that most of the time, I had to tell them to slow down on the amount of alcohol they were putting in. Yes they use plastic cups around the pool and beach, but think about all the broken glass. Drinks are served in glasses at the restaurants and the lobby bar. Snack bar was good, always plenty of food, and the bar there stays open until 2:00. Pools were never crowded. If you showed up on the beach at 1:00, there were not enough beach chairs for everyone but if you think about it, with 200 rooms, you are looking at a minimum of 400 guests. If they put 400 chairs on the beach, people would complain about their being too many chairs on the beach. Try going to a resort with 1,000+ rooms and see what you find. Beach was great, the rooms were clean, always found something good to eat. The Italian place is a must. The tropical jungle feel was really nice. Someone was always cleaning something. . Playa Del Carmen is a great little town. About a 10-15 minute walk through a very nice neighborhood. 4 dollar cab if you choose. Another nice shopping district is up about 5 minutes on the left.

If you are into birds, there is an aviary about a 5 minute walk away towards the town of Playa del Carmen. You can walk to town in 15 minutes, or take a $4 cab in the evening. We purchased a snorkel trip to Cozomel in Playa del Carmen that went to 3 reefs and included the ferry to and from the island for $40. It is a 4 hour trip including the ferry ride, and the way to go as opposed to paying for it at the hotel. At the hotel it was $50 for a one reef trip. For shopping, we didn't discover this until our last night, but if you walk in the direction away from the town of Playa del Carmen (go out of the front of the resort and turn right to go to Playa, left to go away), there is a small shopping center only half the distance it is to walk to Playa. But the trip to Playa is a must, especially if you enjoy bartering. Back to the resort, the rooms are probably the thing I would rate lower than the food and grounds, but they were certainly clean and functional.

The Italian restaurant is worth getting up early and making reservations for! It does kind of suck that you can't make reservations for dinner in advance...their policy is same day reservations, but oh well. The drinks? While it's true they do come in smaller glasses, so what? Do what we did....walk into town and buy the larger insulated mugs that holds more. The bartenders certainly don't mind filling up larger mugs! Also, I have to specifically mention Lucas in the dive shop! I've never scuba dived before and was more than nervous! He was very kind and patient and gave me positive reinforcement the whole way through. It was an incredible experience I'll never forget. He pointed out all sorts of interesting underwater creatures, but the coolest thing of all was seeing an eel that had to be at least 6 feet long! I've read the other comments that are posted about the Reef Club, and as a matter of fact, I work with the people from MN who had a negative experience on their vacation. I booked through the same travel agent and had a WONDERFUL time! It's almost like we went to two different places! I HIGHLY recommend the Reef Club, and would definatly go again. The rooms do have a musty odor to them, but it goes away after you run the air conditioner for a while, and yes, there are certain sewer smells in the air from time to time, but if you are going to let little things like this ruin your trip, then that's your bust! I give the Reef Club two thumbs up! No doubt about it. And, by the way, they DO NOT have bed bugs at this hotel! The trip was well worth the money spent!

The Reef Club is considered 4 Stars - I would rate it a 2, possibly a 3, but NEVER a 4.

The service and the food is horrible - THE WORST. One day my husband went to get us drinks (very small) and he waited for 15 minutes and nobody waited him - it was like he was invisible. I developed a rash, as did others, but everybody thought it was heat rash. Mine continued to get worse, so we got home I went to see my doctor - he said it was one of two things - sand mites or bed bugs. We were only on the beach for 1 day, the first and it continued to get worse, our conclusion was we had 'bed bugs'. My husband didn't develop the rash until day 3. We left the resort most of the time and did enjoy ourselves. The city (20 minute) walk is a great place to enojoy the day or an evening. We went scuba diving in Cozmel - the diving place was called 'Staff Divers' - they were EXCELLENT. We paid $252 total for my husband and I to each have 2 tanks (beach and boat dive) - I would have paid double that - it was so UNBELIEVABLE.

It was our first time staying at a resort and our first time in Mexico, and we had a terrfic time. The club itself was a very pleasent place to stay, and the staff was fantastic!!! The recreation staff were enthusiastic and nice, and the waiters and bartenders were absolutley top notch. While tipping was not required, I recommend occassional tips. If you tip you will receive service even above the normal high standards. Moreover, Mexican salaries are sufficiently low that small tips make a big difference. The drinks were good and had plenty of liquor in them, and good brands of liquor were used. The glasses were small, but when it's all inclsuive, that is relatively unimportant, besides one can get two at a time. The beach was wonderful and clean and their were nice chairs and umbrellas. They did not seem as vigilant about changing the surf condidtion flag as often as other resorts, but you can see the flag from other hotels by peeking down the beach. The food was mediocre. I think of it as being classic buffet. Everything is fine, but nothing is great. The Italian restauraunt is decent but unspectacular. The rooms were nice, comfortable and colorful, though they did do insect extermination once while we were there. We had no bug problems, but they are always vigilant, so if you have problems with chemicals, it is probably not the best place to go. The best thing about Reef Club is its proximity to town. One can walk there in less than 20 minutes, so if you are someone who would like to leave the resort, it is perfect. Even though it's all inclusive, I recommend eating in the City of Playa del Carmen which is a real Mexican town where locals clearly outnumber tourists. If one leaves the crowded tourist street, 5th avenue, there are many very inexpensive and excellent Taquerias. There is also an unbelievably good fish restauraunt right on the waterfront. I can;t remember the name, but the Octopus Ceviche was wonderful. If you want to book a tour, I recommend going into town and booking throught one of the many tourist agencies there. They charge about half of the in-hotel cost. We went to Chichen Itza, which is a long day trip, but well worth it. It is the quintisential Mayan ruins, and if you visit no other archeological sites, go there. We also went to Tullum, though I strongly recommed taking the public bus rather than wasting money on a tour. The 2nd class public bus goes every hour or half hour and costs on ly 2USD. Tullum is an easy and pleasant 45 minute ride.

I must say that I did not read the reviews on this resort until after I booked my trip. Once I had a chance to review them, I immediately felf apprehensive about my choice, but, I thought that the reviews were probably overblown. Let me say that the grounds and people working at of the resort ( pools, walkways, beach , ocean) are very nice. However, We were extremely disappointed with the rooms and the selection of food at the buffets. The rooms, or at least the 3 rooms we had were unacceptable for a 4 star all Inclusive resort. Let me clarify that this was not a cheap trip. We booked it months in advance in order to try and take advantage of the 1 child free deal. The adult fare worked out to $1450/person, $900 for the 11 yr old and the 3 year old payed taxes only. this is not cheap. I have payed less for a 5 star in the DR and Cuba. The reef is not a 4 star resort, 3+ maybe. And I would not classify it as all inclusive, as you have to pay for bottled water, $1 u.s. for a small bottle. Of course, they might use the argument that you can drink the water at the bar and the restaurants for free, they sat that it is \"filtered\". I suppose you could do that , but I wouldn't recommend it as the water has a funny smell to it, and, none of us were comfortable drinking it. . The bed was as hard as a piece of plywood. The pillows were about 1\" thick and just as hard as the bed. Our air conditioner was held together by \"masking tape\", the phone was not working, our mirror in the washroom had deteriated to the point that the silver backing had faded away and it looked like blood drops were on the mirror. Oh yes, lets not forget the smell of the rooms. Actually, there were two separate odors, one from the room itself and the other from the sewer smell that was continually around our rooms. I am not sure if it was just our rooms, but, itwas gross. Bring an air freshener with you, you will need it. Our rooms were fairly close to the front lobby located in the 500 series. The view was terrible. Ourbalcony looked onto a chain linked fence that was interwooven with green plastic. Most tropical. The fence separated our rooms from one of the main roads coming into the resort. That was special. Needles to say we did not spend any time out their. The food was Ok, there just wasn't enough selection, especially for dinner. They had two hot plat stations, both had the same items in them. The grill wasn't too bad, but, I think they need some tips on how to cook meat, especially chicken, they should now that medium rare is not an option. We actually tried to switch hotels, but our Alba rep told us that there was no availability. Alba is another story unto itself. Anyway, I think by now you are getting the picture.

We have stayed at the Viva Maya and Viva Azteca in previous years and looked forward with much anticipation to our trip this year. The Reef Club is a beautiful resort. The grounds are kept immaculate, the rooms clean. I do have to agree with some of the other reviews as far as lack of towels and other toiletries. The second day we had a hard time getting more towels and we were completely out of toilet paper (the room had just been cleaned). Not a big deal, just thought it odd that it was missed. The beach is completely the BEST and it is why we keep returning to the area. I got a massage on the beach and it was heaven. The one thing that we were completely disappointed with was the food and the lack of help at the various bars. Breakfast was fairly good with the omlette bar and other choices, it was easy to find something. Dinner however, a much different story. We ended up going to town 4 nights to eat and we ate one night at the Italian resturant, which was by far the best food we had at the resort. Well worth getting up and standing in line at 7am. There was only 1 bartender at the pool bar and snack bar, which meant you could wait a long time before getting what you ordered. All in all I would say it was a good trip, just not as good as we have experienced in the past. I would give the Reef a 3 star, not a 4 star. We will definitely go back to Playa del Carmen, just not to the Reef Club. Just a side point, if you need to call home there is a place in town that charges only 50 cents a minute.

This is a good 3 1/2 star resort.

However my family of 7 was always able to find something to suit everybody's needs whether it was rice, pasta, fresh fruit, cereal yogurt, roast beef, chicken, fish, etc. Bottelli's Italian restaurant was very good, definetly worth the 630am wake up to make reservations by 7am or chances are you will not get in. We ate there twice and thoroughly enjoyed it. The staff is excellent with children. The bicycles are included but definetly need new ones and were advised they are supposed to be on their way. 15 minute walk to Playa del Carmen or $4.00 usd taxi ride. The beach is beautiful. Recommend trying to get a room in the middle of the property so you are not hearing evening noise from the swim up pool bar open late or the evening show located near the front of the property near reception. Property was always clean and staff was always working hard to keep the grounds clean and guests happy. Even though it's all inclusive we did tip based on service received. A few didn't get anything but some received more than they expected but definetly deserved it. Only one caution is that if the walkways are wet due to rain i would take your time walking as they can get slippery. I hope this helps and if you have any questions let me know i will be more than willing to help out. Remember you are on holidays in a different country and things will not be the way they are at home. If you go with an open mind you will have an excellent vacation.

All the comments Id read prior to arriving left me a little apprehensive but I was pleasantly surprised. [I think some people are just never satisfied.] I had spent 3 days prior in Cancun and also had a very nice experience despite being told it was a crazy tourist trap. There were hardly any people at my hotel there and I had the whole pool to myself. When I arrived in Playa at the Reef I was a little surprised there were so many people. Cancun had spoiled me. Once Id adjusted to the large attendance (and I heard that during peak season its VERY crowded) I really enjoyed myself. I chatted with lovely people from all over Germans (many), Italians, Americans, British, South Americans, Mexicans and more...The beaches were clean and with turquoise water. There were snorkeling trips you could take for $25US that lasted 1 \u00bd hours that left from the beach at the Reef and you didnt have to spend all day doing an organized tour. You still had the rest of the day to do your own thing. I went twice because Id had such a lovely time.The staff was great. I found if you tip them a small amount for the all inclusive drinks, you get very attentive service. The room was clean and spacious. Mine was on the 3rd level. It had a small balcony on one side with two chairs overlooking the jungled walkways and a patio with two reclining lounge chairs that was very private. The air conditioner was a small wall unit which was rather loud and needed to be turned on and off as it would be too hot or too cold at times, but it wasnt that much bother to me. There was a safe deposit box in the room for an extra fee of $2US a day more you need to get the lock and key from the reception desk. The key has a $100US lost key fee so be careful. My room also had a resident iguana that lived in the lamp outside on the balcony. I rather enjoyed his company. We would respect each others space and this arrangement worked well. The food was OK. Nothing too memorable but I always found something from the assortment. Even the Italian restaurant was average. I heard the chocolate cake was very good there but I never tried it. I didnt go there for the food so I was not too disappointed. The drinks were best from the Mango Bar. The ones from the pool bars tasted a bit funky. We could not figure out why. They tasted a bit like pool water if you stick with the beer youll be OK. Beer tasted fine.As for all the American bashing I read in other reviews, I did encounter a few loud Americans but I also encountered a few loud/rude Germans, Italians, etc. But some of the most helpful and friendliest people were the Americans. I found a few of the Europeans were a bit too self superior. One good example is when we placed our towels on chairs on the beach to reserve them and returned (not long later) to find an Italian couple had moved them and taken the spots. We had been there a few days and knew this was what other people did to reserve a chair. Somehow this couple felt justified being so rude. We made them move! Later, we noticed towels in THEIR chairs and no people around. Need I say what we were tempted to do? What nerve some people have. I was very impressed with the continuous maintenance of the place. Workers were constantly cleaning walkways, painting chairs, repairing fences and attending to small details that make the place very comfortable. I have a hard time figuring out why some people complain about the place. But some of the most enjoyable parts of the trip were the chance to meet lovely people from all over the world, to take in the sights and sun of this beautiful location and to not have to go anywhere if we didnt want to as everything was provided. It was a fantastic trip and I would go gladly again.", "Date": "November 16, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "bournemouth", "Title": "\u201creview the reviewers\u201d", "Author": "BournemouthBluebell", "ReviewID": "UR1419721", "Content": "Having read the reviews of Reef Club over the past months, we had some anxieties about our stay from 7-22nd October, 2003 but took some of the advice from previous reviewers and also went with an open mind. The Reef Club is not one of the opulent and rather ostentacious hotels situated nearby. Its main charm for us was its uniqueness with accommodation in smaller, rustic buildings rather than a faceless, brick and glass showcase. The facts we found were rather different from many of the reviews. The room was fine, this \"musty\" smell that people complain of is that of trees and tropical vegetation to be found everywhere in such climates. We have experienced this in Cuba, India, Sri Lanka and Thailand and several other places. To us it seemed logical to expect this and took the advice of previous reviewers and took a small air freshener result = no problems. Similarly with insects/bugs this IS the jungle, we took precautions and were fine, we saw nothing at all in our room, only outside. The beds are firm but not too hard, similarly the pillows, if you want more you just ask, no problems. The room was cleaned very well daily, one day I lost an earing which rolled under a bed and I couldn't reach, that evening after cleaning it was back on the side table= shows thorough cleaning to me. The grounds are beautiful and the walkways/seating condusive to a relaxed and pleasant atmosphere. The beach is absolutely beautiful, sand fine and pristine and the water clear and safe. The food was fine, there was massive choices, quite a lot not to our tastes as we are non-meat eaters and not over-fond of very spicy food but there was never a time when we could not find something. The drinks were plentiful and varied, we found no evidence of watering down and the sizes were fine. The complaints re size are odd anyway as you just get another one!! The pools are not olympic sized and not really geared to swimming as one has mainly games in it and the other, the pool bar but they were ok and we saw no evidence of missing tiles etc apart from two tiny 1\" squares, if previous complaints meant this then it beggars beleief. The staff were exceptional, everyone was friendly and courteous and worked so hard. Rooms and grounds constantly being cleaned, the waiters/waitresses polite and attentive and the bar staff so calm when being given complex orders for several cocktails at once. The front desk staff too were very helful, we saw no evidence of rudeness as cited by some previous reviewers, at least not by the staff! The entertainment team were brilliant, worked tirelessly to keep guests entertained by day and at the nightly shows. The shows were not professional standard but fine for holiday entertainment and top notch for effort. The guests were a wide mixture of nationalities which was lovely, the Italians with their excited chatter and infectious laughter were lovely, we met polite and charming groups of Dutch, Swiss and Scandanavian guests and warm, friendly Canadians. Nearly everyone seemed to gel well and it was lovely to see children of different nationalities playing together, regardless of language. However, the only negative thing for us was not the hotel, food, beds,rooms, staff or entertainment but SOME guests from a certain country. We felt it ironic that most of the negative comments from reviewers had come from America but now we know why. Some of the American guests were lovely but quite a large proportion showed the most appalling behaviours. They were rude and dismissive to staff who were trying their best, complained loudly and often about food and drink sizes, kept comparing everything to \"home\" and how much better service was in America, how beds were bigger/softer/nicer etc, one wondered why they travelled! We were concerned how many seemed to have a hearing problem and needed to shout at the top of their voices to people a few feet away, completely unconcerned that other guests were reading/snoozing etc. At one point we gave up trying to get a drink at the pool bar as it was often commandeered by a loud group who propped it up for hours, voicing their views on evrything. The behaviour of SOME of the American children was appalling, their table manners abysmal and whinging \"I want\" non-stop. One small boy was constantly climbing precariously near huge pottery ornaments, moving tables and chairs just as waiters were approaching with laden trays or wandering around near the hot food. One of our memories will be of \"Chriiiiiiiiis...........as his parents yelled for him periodically!!! The reef club is a good place to holiday with many facilities, not 5* but a good 4*, out tip, take ear-plugs but not for swimming!!!", "Date": "October 23, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris, France", "Title": "\u201cIt's a rip off!\u201d", "Author": "Eiffel_Tower", "ReviewID": "UR1395906", "Content": "We booked this hotel through a travelling agency in France for our honeymoon.

I read all the reviews and became a bit paranoid about the negative things related by other travelers. If bad things do happen, they do happen to me. = ) We were picked up at the hotel in a limo, much to our surprise (thru Lomas/FunJet) and to more of our surprise- it had an exhaust leak that we thought wed pass out from!! We arrived at the hotel about noon or so and had no problem what-so-ever getting in. Our room was ready and a eager staff member dragged our horrendously heavy bags to our room. We were given the choice of floor levels and were put in a bldg. right by the pools. He even dragged our bags upstairs! I read a lot about the A/C units and musty smells- luckily we did not have that problem. It was *plenty* cold, not noisy at all, and no musty smell. They did forget to mention, however, that you had to check out the remote to the unit at the front desk and it took us a while to get that information from them. 3 phone calls later, after being told someone would bring it right to me, we went and got it ourselves. We did have a pretty persistent ant problem. Housekeeping came in a sprayed (although what Im not sure- I didnt see any signs of what shed been making all that noise in the bathroom about) and it did no good. They werent vicious little fire ants, they were just a nuisance. Everyone is correct in saying that the grounds were kept IMMACULATELY. I thought the jungle, rainforest theme was charming- but I noticed only person mentioned the little slippery tiles. Holy Moses! One of us almost fell everytime we walked around. Barefoot wasnt too bad, but with shoes on- they were slick. The staff was very energetic and really seemed to take their jobs seriously. I got a big kick of just watching them and the way they interacted with everyone else. We were very surprised at how lingual they all seemed to be. There really werent very many other people from the States that we found although my daughter did find the only other people from Texas! It seemed that the entire country of Holland up and decided to take a vacation and come together. The drink glasses were small, but as long as you wanted- they would refill it. Sometimes it was a bit slow, but the backlog would pile up; seemingly due to the glasses being so small. I personally thought the food was horrible, but I am the 2nd pickiest eater on the continent- so dont lend much weight to my opinion of the food. My boyfriend ate just about everything they served. We did agree on the desserts- many people have noted they seemed to be filled with some liquid which rendered them soggy. My daughter and I managed to survive at the snack bar on the hot dogs and hamburgers. Of course the breads were all kind of stale and hard- but it was edible. Botticelli was a treat. We were told that you absolutely HAD to wear long pants (went into town and bought an outfit- who brings anything but shorts and sandals to Mexcio?) but discovered that it didnt have to be anything fancy, as long as you didnt show up in your shorts and sandals. I enjoyed the food, as did my daughter- who is the pickiest eater in America. The buffet restaurant service varied from day to day although it was the same staff. ??? One afternoon, we left never having gotten anything to drink. Other times, they were on us before we sat down. When we tried to approach the bat ourselves- we were told it would be brought to us, although we had to inquire again before it was. The beach *was* beautiful. Very unpopulated. We saw a handful of topless women. The first one took my daughter by surprise, then she didnt seem to notice again. We enjoyed all the night shows they offered. My daughter would get up and join the final song and dance every night and it seemed to last an eternity- but it was fun. We visited Xcaret (ish-kuh-rot) while there and although we had a good time- the website made it seem much more glorious than it was. The people in town on 5th Ave. were like little flea market guys. They would yell out, Hey family! Hey honeymooners! Hey Americans! Hey.. whatever they thought would catch your eye. They were generally able to be waved off with a no thank-you or ignoring them altogether, but if you happened to stop at one of the shops by them.look out! Especially if you went into one store- when you came out, shop owners for the next 3 blocks would say, Its my turn now! You went in there, now come in here! and the time share people would clobber you. We were able to get some waterproof sunblock from Target that was 50 SPF and some aloe vera gel made by Mossimo that really, really worked great. Id suggest taking stock in this tip! We used the $2/day safes, just to ease our minds. Nothing seemed to have been rifled thru during our outings though. All in all, Id say our trip was a success and we all had a good time. For the price we paid we were pleased. My daughter was able to stay for free and the staff really took an interest in making her stay a good one as well. I wouldnt stay here again merely because I would want to try something different and experience a new resort- but for laid back, easy-going travelers, this a hotel that does just fine.

My husband and I have stayed at all-inclusives before, and were pleasantly surprised by the variety of different foods available at the buffets. No, not everything was to our liking, but this is another country, and you have to realize that folks generally like what they've grown up eating. The fact that there is much to choose from makes it just fine. The centerpieces were something to behold; the staff carved fancy shapes out of different fruits and vegetables. Every night there was a different selection of main courses, and a different featured meat made or carved before your eyes. The desserts were plentiful, varied and decorated beautifully, but they were probably the least enjoyable part of the meal for me. Hard to guess what the flavor would be, and their cakes were always soaked in some sort of liquid, but not liquor. The pies were really hard to identify. The rest of my family liked them. Oh well, I don't normally order them at home very often either. The wait staff was usually right there to take your drink order, except in the mornings, when it seemed like we couldn't get anyone's attention for coffee. Can't speak for lunch, as we never made it in. There was a grill with burgers, hot dogs, pizza, etc. I pigged out on the nachos every day, and loaded the chips with hot cheese, quacamole and salsa. In the restaurant we tried tipping, but weren't sure how much, or if anyone else was doing it, or if it was even effective. There is a nice Italian restaurant (Botticelli's) upstairs for which you must make reservations the morning of. I loved it, but my husband's lasagna tasted like Chef Boyardee. Have the Italian Chocolate dessert if you like hot brownie sundaes. Mmmm! The boys really enjoyed the pool (they have two, both only 4ft deep, and one is a swim up bar where all the single drinkers hung out, so we avoided that one with the kids). Why kids will swim endlessly in a pool when there's a whole beautiful ocean and powdery beach nearby is beyond me, but we were just glad they were having a good time. Don't let your kids pick up the big chlorine tablets at the bottom of the pool. The kids club was kind of cheesy with a very small swingset. But we didn't care because our boys are older. But if you expect to have your kids entertained, you might inquire further. I really couldn't speak on behalf of the kids activities, because there were only a couple other kids at the resort besides our own. There are raucous and fun activities put on by the peppy entertainment staff at various times during the day, including volleyball, water and regular aerobics, silly games, etc. and of course, the nightly \"drama club\" stuff they do. We were there to relax, and are a bit antisocial we admit, so we didn't do much besides enjoy watching others make fools of themselves. Hey, to each his own, right? One suggestion: bring large insulated mugs, and you will always have enough cold libations to keep you hydrated and happy. We hooked up with a wonderful waiter (Isidro) who filled them up with whatever we requested. We definitely tipped him for his efforts, and had his attention the entire week. The employees were for the most part very nice, loved the boys, and appreciated my humble efforts at speaking their language. Believe me, a little attempt to fit into their culture goes a long way. Yes, there is alot of topless activity going on. We were concerned about how the boys would take it, but after sighting the first three \"pairs,\" they couldn't have cared less. And isn't it always the case, that the ones with the strangest bodies are the most eager to show them off. We Just explained that to many places in the world, being topless is the norm at the beach. Our room was fine, a little musty until you get the a/c going, the beds were a little firm (I didn't mind it, but my husband was sort of sore) and the pillows sort of flat. The only thing I didn't like about the room was that the pillows smelled sour. I put a handtowel over it and slept like that. Bring something to freshen the room like air freshener, incense, candle. The bathroom was very nice, roomy with lots of H2O pressure. The maids did a good job of cleaning the rooms, but we had a bad time with being short on stuff (not enough towels, no soap bars, shampoo instead of soap bars, no toilet paper, ran out of kleenex). This happened several times during the week. Twice I had to go to the front desk to request the needed items. Both times the things were brought quickly. I wonder if it was because we didn't tip the maid until the end, but by then, we were sort of ticked off about the incomplete job they did, and did not end up tipping them at all. Vicious circle, I guess. There was a room safe, which costs about $2 a day to use, and it is well worth it. We had no other problems with security. About reserving your beach chair: get up early (at least 7:30) and put them on your favorite chairs. No one will move or steal the towels. It was worth it to me to have our spot for the day. We chose a palapa (palm umbrella thing) far from the activities. Farther to walk back and forth to the bathrooms and food, but after all, it was about all the exercise I got all week. The facility itself was really beautiful in a jungle-Swiss Family Robinson sort of way. There was a wood walkway over a small ravine and a rock wall with water trickling over it. Then you meander down this cement path through lush groundcover and under the canopy of twisting trees and vines to your room, which is one of 12 in a brightly-colored three-story stucco \"townhouse.\" At night, the path is illuminated so it takes on a magical feeling. I absolutely loved the whole set up and ambiance of the resort. The best thing about this place is that it only has 200 rooms, versus double or triple that for surrounding resorts. We were there off-peak season, and liked the fact that we didn't have to compete with other guests for anything. Lots of different nationalities represented. I thought we'd be among Americans, but was pleasantly surprised to share in the cosmopolitan air of an international destination. Although the beach was wide, had very white sand, and the water clear and warm, I was a little disappointed in that there were very few shells or fish to see. I'm a bit of a beachcomber. I found the water and sand to my liking in Cozumel, where for some reason, there were plenty of fish and shells. Even sea glass. So I was surprised that there could be such a difference only a few miles away. And the smokers have a nasty habit of dropping their butts in the sand and leaving them. Beware, you may come back from that romantic walk down the beach with cigarette butts in between your toes! Perhaps my sons and I should have made our sandcastle and decorated the top with butts instead of seaweed. Do you think they'd have gotten the hint? Second suggestion: you can never have enough 30 block, and put it on more than once a day. The stuff in the hotel boutique is about double what it is in the States, so avoid sticker shock and load up at Walmart. Okay, I think I covered it all. For a family vacation, it was great.

We travelled via Sunquest Tours & we picked up immediately from the airport to our resort. There were no lines at check-in, our rooms were ready, and the front desk & bell-boy was quick with our luggage and getting us settled in. There definitely was a musty smell in the air (don't forget you're in a tropical & damp environment), but nothing a little bit of air-freshner and some time with the a/c turned on couldn't fix. Overall, we had a great time... sports & entertainment team were energetic and always trying to get the guests involved in the activities, the Botecelli Restaurant was delicious & the service was great. Everyone working at the resort was friendly and made a huge effort in keeping guests happy (even at smoldering temperatures of 40 degrees Celsius!)... well derserved of the tips they earned from us! The evening shows are also worth watching... great costumes and fun for people of all ages! Also, the jungle like ground decoration made the walk between buffet really enjoyable. There was always people keeping the place tidy or trimming the hedges. Finally... the beach. Definitely the jewel of the whole place! White sandy beaches, & aqua blue/green water. The resort had big huge soft towels and it was perfect for lying on it or drying yourself off... so relaxing! Resort was filled with 70% Europeans, 15% Americans & Canadians, 15% Mexicans. It wasn't very packed .. probably 'cuz everyone was back at work/school. We did ask for a room change (because our telephone line was broken for three days in a row, after they came in each day to fix it), and ended up with a room on the third floor that had its own roof-top balcony. Very romantic! The front desk was very accomodating and gave us no problems when we requested a room change. :) Some tips: - do bring your own air-freshner - book Botecelli restaurant early in the morning (worth waking up for) - buy a set of snorkelling mask & tube from Canadian Tire/Walmart - bring a reuseable underwater camera (we borrowed one from a friend) - buy Pesos in your own country from your bank (cheaper than the exchange rates offered in Mexico ), and -don't buy day trip packages from the hotel (buy it in town where it's much cheaper and equally safe). Our day trip package of Tulum/Xel-ha was offered for $96 US all inclusive/person at the hotel, and we bought it in Playa Del Carmen for $62 US all inclusive/person from an lcoal agency that had a store front establishment. We also rented a 125 CC red new scooter once we got onto Cozumel for $20 US for the day, zipped down to Chakanaab Eco-Park (20 min scooter ride), paid $10 US entrance fee each, brought our own snorkelling stuff, and went snorkelling for free.

We did not avail ourselves of all the activities the resort has to offer as we were off property several days exploring the area on our own, but when there found the beach staff, maids, and especially the wait staff all very friendly, helpfull and extremely hard working. Even though this is \"all inclusive\" it is nice to tip the workers a few dollars here and there. They make very little money, and are so appreciative of anything you give them. We tip the maid as soon as we see her upon arrival, and then again at the end of our stay. We would leave a dollar at breakfast, and a couple at dinner, and more in the sit down restaurant. This was our third trip to the Playacar area and we have always found the people here to be warm, kind and very friendly. There are only two areas for improvement which would make this a better resort. The first is the pools which are very small and not inviting for swimming (but then there is that beautiful ocean!), and for us this did not matter, but it might for others. The second is the food. We never went hungry, but having stayed at other all inclusives where the food was much better both in variety and preparation, we feel there is room for improvement, especially since this is a smaller resort. We had no problem getting reservations at Boticelli's and had three meals here. The food was much better than at the buffet, but not what we would call outstanding. They only change the menu once a week--every Monday, and the choices are limited. The service and the setting however were wonderful. Despite almost three full days of rain, we had a lovely time and are already planning to return to Playacar again, but in June as we have in the past and when the weather is usually better! However, we will pay the extra money and stay at either the Allegro or the Gala where we know the food is better.", "Date": "September 10, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Granite Bay, CA", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for our family\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1274413", "Content": "The Reef Club was perfect for our family of five. The front desk was polite when we were advised we could not get adjoining rooms so they upgraded us to a suite with an ocean view. The food was not perfect all the time, but I appreciated the fact that they seemed to try and appease all nationalilties. I was always amazed at what a great job the waiters and waitress were at every meal, It was as if they were watching you to see when and where you were going to sit so they could be right there to take your beverage order, regardless of how crowded the resturant was. The food in the Italian resturant was fabulous as was the service. It was most definetly a $300 meal for my family of 5 which we paid $15 for and that was for the bottle of excellent wine we purchased. It really is worth getting up a little early one day to make the reservations for this meal. The bartenders in the pool bar can be a little crabbey and slow sometimes but they work very hard and have to put up with some pretty rude guests, it helps to give them a few pesos every once in while. I did experience some very rude guests at the hotel, and they were always Americans! Very embarassing. The price was definitly right for what we got. There was only one thing I found disappointing about our stay in Playcar and that was the timeshare folks. They actually grabbed us as soon as we picked up our luggage at the airport. They are very slick and make you believe they are with the airport and are there to help you. When we went in to town we were accosted every ten feet by these guys. They really need to do something about that. It got to the point where we did not want to go to town because we didn't want to put up with them. The Reef Club is great about keeping people away from you that are trying to sell things. The beach was beautiful and very clean. The only little complaint I have and I realize the hotel has no control over this, but they really do stress a family atmosphere, and there are hotels all over that cater to individuals who want to sunbath European style but there they were, right on the Reef Club beach.

We are active, physically fit, middle-aged Californians, well traveled in Mexico, especially the dive-resort vacation spots. We go for the scuba diving primarily, and have always enjoyed Mexican Resorts and diving even under less than ideal conditions (think La Ceiba back in the day!). We love Mexico, and feel that the Mexican people in general are wonderful, honest, and very hard working.Reef Club and Sun Trips booked us on the Red Eye flight from Oakland, and when we arrived after being up for over 30 hours, we were informed that our room would not available for hours. Dead tired, hot, sweaty, and still in the same clothes Get me to my room! Outrageous. The front desk staff should ALL be fired. They were rude, condescending, arrogant, untruthful, and not at all helpful.When we finally did get to our room in the mid-afternoon, we were very disappointed with the condition of the room itself. Everything was second-class. A hard but clean bed, fraying at all edges of the box spring, was adequate. Pitiful decorations hung on the wall. The bathroom mirror was in poor condition, and a very noticeable rust stain took up the middle of the floor. Towels were clean, big and fluffy. To any of the ladies who might read this, there was not a single power outlet in the bathroom. To dry her hair, my wife had to use the outlet next to the bed, and stretch over to the mirrored closet door to see herself. Very annoying. The cheapest 19 TV sat on the desk, and very loud A/C unit that mostly worked kept the room fairly cool.My wife was very happy that they did have a bathtub, but when she ran the tap, it filled the tub with a brownish-yellowish colored liquid, that was not noticeable when you took a shower.The overall condition of the property presents well, with a lush Polynesian thatched roof d\u00e9cor. Beware, however, of the extremely dangerous conditions of the super-slippery tiles that are everywhere. I had several serious near-falls, and saw one elderly gentleman take a very hard spill at the entrance to the upstairs bar and pool table area. The restaurant was especially dangerous, although they always put up Wet Floor signs.The pools were OK (tiles missing all along the edges), and the beach was one of the best weve seen. The guests that we met were varied, but the all-inclusive policy may have a flaw. All the booze you can drink. A group of particularly expressive Germans assaulted the pool area every day from dawn to dusk, mostly loud and drunken partiers. In the right frame of mind, they could be fun. Otherwise, they could be annoying.The worst case by far was the two young studs from either New York or New Jersey (judging by their accents). From the pencil thin goatee/beards, the dangling gold chains, the pair of earrings, tattoos, they were a sight to see.Unfortunately for everyone else, they had no understanding of how to behave in a public place, and were a source of endlessly spewing profanity and vulgarity. Every other word was proceeded by ******* this and mother ****** that. If you had the misfortune to sit anywhere near them in the restaurant, you were offended and embarrassed at being an American. The last straw was the disgustingly loud belch that ripped at breakfast on the last day. They just laughed at their own rudeness. No lifeguards at the pools and no one in charge to keep these clowns in line.The staff were all very nice, but seriously inexperienced. You had to routinely flag down a waiter/waitress for service. The food was simply horrible. Few choices, and almost always the same food, often repeated from lunch to dinner. The only way they know how to cook eggs is to burn them.I read another review about the Buticeelli Restaurant, and made and cancelled reservations there. I would have been very upset if they had charged me for eating there, but $200 for a lobster dinner at an All Inclusive is just too much. Yes, the power went out, the TV cable went out, but I expect that in Mexico, no big deal.As for the diving, the Dive Staff on the premises is good. Some good personalities and a real effort to make things go right. To be honest, the diving was not that good, especially compared to Cozumel, just 40 minutes away. The weather was stormy, and the visibility was about 50 feet. The dive boat was crappy, but they did not overfill it. The ladder was broken, so you had to take off all equipment in the water every time you got back onto the boat. Service on the boat was non-existent except for the help you got checking your equipment. I asked the Captain if he would hand me my camera after I rolled into the water. He looked at me with disgust, grunted out loud, and pointed to the back of the boat, whatever the heck that meant. Sorry, my mistake. One of the non-diver guests helped me out.In all of our dive experiences, they always provided plenty of liquid refreshment, including water, juice, and soda, as well as an assortment of breads, croissants, cheeses, and cold cuts, for between dives. Here, you were lucky to get warm bottled water, and they always ran out before the trip was over. They even ran out of air tanks, and the photographer could not go on the last dive. Organization not a strong suit.Dive masters were good, with Van leading the pack. He has a real good touch with the kids so he is the guy if you want you son or daughter to take up diving. Manuel was good, but was so laid back I could swear he actually fell asleep underwater during our drift diving, hands folded across his chest, eyes closed, floating exactly two or three feet off the bottom, with perfect buoyancy control. Ricardo took pictures, and did a good job for a very reasonable price.We took several trips into town and were routinely accosted by the locals plying us with free this and cheap that, always sounding too good to be true, but when you asked a question or two, you found that sure, you would get the deal, but had to sit thru a time-share presentation. As if. One particularly suave gentleman stopped us on the beach and had us fully engaged, and was teaching my wife to speak to me in Spanish in a fun and very romantic manner.He liked us so much that he invited us to breakfast the next morning, and he would comp us at any event, whether excursion to the ruins, and full dive trips. WOW! Really, youll pay for us to go diving in Cozumel? Sure will, be here in the morning and after the presentation presentation? What presentation? Oh, didnt I mention, you get the freebie AFTER the presentation. No thanks. Ive heard that this presentation can be very forceful, and stressful, trying to get you to sign up for a time-share.Well, enough already, if youve read this far you must really want to go, so go and try and have a good time. My suggestion, save a few more bucks and go to Columbus Isle in San Salvador to relax and dive, or try Cozumel if you really want Mexico and diving.", "Date": "September 2, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Fl", "Title": "\u201cReef club great for open minded people\u201d", "Author": "JeremyF", "ReviewID": "UR1272113", "Content": "My wife and I just returned from celebrating our 3rd anniversary at the Reef Club in Playa del Carmen in August and we had a fantastic time.

First of all, you are traveling to another country, Mexico, and although a lot of people do speak English, this is not America so for those who complained about the language, next time go to Orlando. Yes, the food is different, but remember you did not pay for a Ritz Carlton vacation, so why should you expect that type of food. We ate with people from Mexico, USA, Canada and many Europeans and everyone we met was able to find something they liked at the buffet which basically had everything, its normal all-inclusive resort food, nothing better, nothing worse. The great thing about the hotel is its a 10 minute walk or 4 dollar cab ride to town, which has tons of delicious, cheap restaurants so try them out a couple of nights for dinner, you wont be disappointed. The rooms are great for the price (we got upgraded) and had no bugs, A/C was working almost too well, we had to turn it off at night, we brought an air freshner but really did not experience anything about the musty smell. Also, it seemed that many complaints came from people who think all-inclusive means all-me or leave your manners at home, the workers at the Reef club work their butts off, every one of them, to make your vacation enjoyable, so enjoy it and respect them and the culture that you are visiting. Although it might not make a huge difference, dont be afraid to give these guys a couple of bucks in tips, they certainly deserve it. Much has been said about the Reef Club in these reviews, so all I want to add is that this hotel is a great deal, very charming with spectacular views and one of the better beaches on the strip (certainly the least crowded!) if you show the same respect and kindness to the people at the hotel that you expect, you will have a great time. We walked into several other hotels and felt the most comfortable at the Reef (it is also smaller and more charming), we saw two weddings, several anniversaries (including ours) , honeymoons and many family vacationers at the Reef Club, so it has something for everyone, unless you are the type to complain about everything that is different from what your are used to, in which case I suggest you go to Disney or stay home.", "Date": "September 2, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, Ca", "Title": "\u201c...Reef Club is very nice..\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1270985", "Content": "We just came back for a 7 days vacation and stayed at the Reef.

We stayed there 10 days, 9 nights, through Apple Vacations May 10 -May 19, 2003. We got an outstanding deal - $1,022 each, all-inclusive, including all taxes, fees, and trip insurance, Indianapolis, IN to Cancun, with a l-hr. layover in Charlotte, NC, via US Airways. When we checked in around noon, we did not even have to wait for our room, as is usually the case. We requested a room on the 2nd or 3rd floor; we had read about the occasional ant problems at this site. They gave us a room on the 3rd floor about half way between the front lobby and the beach. It was only about a 2 minute walk to either one. The room was quite spacious and had 2 double beds, which we did not find too hard. The air conditioner was truly wonderful - never too warm! There was plenty of closet and drawer space and a wonderful, spacious bathroom and shower. The beach was the Reef's crown jewel, broad and uncrowded. The beautiful Caribbean Sea was various wonderful shades of turquoise. The 1st day of the trip we had huge waves - I loved it! I had been a little worried about never having any waves due to Cozumel being offshore. We have always loved the Cancun waves for body surfing. We have been to Cancun 7 times, visiting Playa only on day trips. We first saw Playa del Carmen in 1986, on our first trip to Mexico. The changes that have occured over the years are unbelievable! Playa is totally different than it was back in the 80's and 90's. The beaches in Playacar are still magnificant, but we were a little disappointed in some of the beaches downtown, compared to how they used to be. There seemed to be a lot more seaweed and a lot more boats. Also, they seemed much more crowded. On this trip, the ocean varied by the day. Some days there were fantastic body surfing waves; other days were great for just swimming. The whole time we were there, though, we had the wonderful swells. Each morning we went out to put our towells on the chairs with palapas around 7:00 A.M. By doing this, we always had shade. We would never be gone for long periods and still reserve the palapas. To us, that seemed unfair. All of the Reef Club's employees were very helpful and friendly. They all work so hard and appreciate any tips so much. Definitely take insulated mugs for the beach. They will not only refill them for you, but will rinse them out if needed. The buffet at the Reef Club was OK, not outstanding; there was always a good variety of food. We would have liked more Mexican dishes. Some of the chicken and fish dishes were OK. Breakfast was probably the best of all the meals. The made to order omelettes were outstanding. The chocolate ice cream available at the bar was also great. Botticelli's, the Italian restaurant that you made reservations for at 7:00-7:30 A.M. on the morning that you wanted to eat there for that night, had excellent Italian food but poor and very slow service. The snack bar by the pool had good burgers, hotdogs, pizza and nachos. We have done a lot of side trips and excursions on our other 7 trips to the Mexican Yucatan, including Cozumel, Chichen Itza, Coba, Tulum, Xcaret, Xel-ha, the jungle tour, and various snorkeling tours. This time we just wanted to enjoy things on our own. We used the Reef Club's bikes 1 day, took a bus shopping trip to Cancun another day, explored the other hotels' beaches via walking the beach, and walked into Playa nearly every day. We thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful Caribbean and magnificent beach every day and the pool a few times. We took the free scuba lesson in the pool and plan on doing more scuba on a future trip. The pool was a great place to meet people from all over the world, but it got quite warm in the afternoon. I much preferred the refreshing Caribbean to swim in. The one thing we did outside the resort that cost more than a few dollars was to hire a taxi to take us to Paamul to snorkel. He could either wait on us or pick us up 3 hours later. The Reef Club found us an English speaking driver for $10 per hour. We thought this was a really good price because we paid that on Cozumel 5 years ago. Paamul was wonderful - we saw lots of various kinds of fish and beautiful living coral. The day we went, we were the only people snorkeling. We swam out to where the waves were breaking, but there were fish and living coral even before we got there. We also met some American RV's here - Tom & Susan, who showed us the wonderful palapa they had attached to their RV. We also met several other nice people there. Tom & Susan and the others were all extremely friendly and helpful. We really enjoyed chatting with them. We plan on returning to Playa del Carmen next April or May, hopefully staying at the Reef Club again, and definitely returning to Paamul. We would also like to use the Collectivos to go there and other places, Akumal, etc. We have checked out the prices of some reasonable downtown hotels, and don't really see how a person can beat an all-inclusive deal. We usually go through Apple or Funjet out of Chicago or Indianapolis. Even if you get a nice air-conditioned hotel for $35-$40 per night, by the time you add on airfare, taxes, fees, meals, drinks, and all the other things that are included in an all-inclusive package, it has always came to a lot more. Plus, we saw no downtown beaches that even came close to being as nice as the Reef Club Playacar's beach. We did eat downtown once; it was OK, not spectacular.

My husband and I and 3 kids stayed for 8 days July 16-23. The food was horrible! Not many choices and not very good at all. This was the very LEAST of our problems! To begin with, the running water in the hotel sink and shower both had a very foul smell - we brushed our teeth with bottled water it was so disgusting. Maintenance came on 2 occasions because of shower problems and again to fix the toilet. It never did get fixed, it ran the whole time producing a running water sound. The 5th day into our vacation the ELECTRICITY went OUT!!!! It was out for over 3 hours. We called the front desk who said a power line blew throughout the island. This was not true, the a/c units and lights across the way were on the whole time, also the lit up walkway and pool outside our room was lit. It was apparently our wing. (3 hours can seem like an eternity in the dark with no a/c and 3 frightened children under 6 yrs old at bedtime) The next morning the hot water wasn't working - we began to lose our patience at this point and called the front desk manager but were brushed off. Lastly, there were bugs, so many the exterminator came. With all that said, I will mention the one good thing - the staff. They were all very kind and friendly and really helped us try and enjoy ourselves inspite of the poor conditions.

Initially we were assigned a room with 2-full size beds but were able to get a king size bed the 2nd night without a hassle. The room was fairly clean although the bedroom curtain was a little scummy and the beds were hard. The room smelled musty at first but a little Lysol and airing out took care of it. We found it necessary to keep the AC on all the time to reduce the humidity and it worked very well (although it was a bit too cool). Housekeeping was very good as we were always promptly provided fresh towels. There were even a couple of days when we returned to the room to find the towels folded into swans. Bottled water was $1 but you can refill with purified water at the dining room and bars but the taste wasn't the best. We liked the fact that the resort was small since it did not seem to be overly crowded. The folks there seemed pleasant, not especially friendly, but generally helpful and polite. The resort staff seemed to be laid back with the service but didn't mind letting us know when it was time to leave. The hotel grounds were very clean (constantly being groomed by the workers) and the beach was definitely a plus. The location was conveniently 15min walk from Playa Del Carmen through the beautiful streets of Playacar. It's worth the walk vs the $4 cab ride and you can catch the ferry to Cozumel or bus (and onboard movie) to Tulum for a few bucks. The total trip to the Mayan ruins will set you back about $9 per person vs the $40 the tour folks wanted. Of course you don't get the guided tour but for us it's more fun to explore on our own. Watch out for the mosquitoes in the shade at Tulum - they'll feast on you - stay in the open sunlight. If you can, take a dive excursion with the onsite dive service ($85) to Tortugas reef to see the turtles and the tarpon. Be sure to pay when you sign up vs billing to your room or the exchange rate will almost work against you when you settle up at checkout - funny how that works. The food was typical buffet style menu - good but nothing special. The best part of lunch/dinner was that at the carving table there was a better option - roast beef, grilled chicken/beef, pork, pasta. The rest of the meal usually was bland for our taste but adequate; usuallya few meat dishes plus veggies, salad fixings (but the dressings were tasteless) and fruit, but little Mexican food. Usually there were ice cream cones (grainy but a nice treat) at lunch time. Dessert was not that appealing and breakfast buffet got monotonous. The snack bar had burgers and the like, but we didn't sample too much of that. For the most part the food was a little oily and bland so we were ready for home cooking and good ol' American style food toward the end; don't expect too much chocolate there. Bars were okay but the bartenders' skills limited drink choices and the quality of the drinks seemed to vary with every trip to the bar. The servers and bartenders seemed to appreciate the occasional tip but didn't seem to have any real influence as we, for the most part, received slow (hey it's a resort) but reasonable service. Judging from the experience by other folks at different resorts on our way home, we were glad that we were at the Reef Club.

We talked to some of these people later who were from Arkansas, had never seen the ocean before, and had saved and saved for their first vacation away from the US - they were scammed by the hotel into staying on top of a hill away from the beach.

The restaurant upstairs, the one you had to make a reservation for was ok. Overall, we always were able to find something to eat, we did eat out once, just for a change.

The kids were kept busy during the day with games on the beach and pool and at night they had a mini disco for them, which they loved. The shows at night were pretty good, better than any we have seen anywere else in Mexico. The beach was gorgeous, you did have to get up pretty early to reserve a shaded seat, same for the pool.

That being said, we enjoyed the R.C. so much and it was so cheap, and so close to town, that in the future, even if it is just my wife and I, we might stay there again. (I can't believe I'm saying that! :o ) We'll eat breakfast and lunch there, lounge and drink at the pool and beach, and then go into PDC for dinner and revelry.It is not \"fancy.\" It is tatsteful, super clean, small, well-laid out, and has nice planted areas all over. The rooms were nicer than I was expecting (ask for a room in one of the first 4 buildings next to the pool, I don't think the level would matter much. I think any further might have been slightly less convenient.) Our rooms were cleaned every single day by the same woman. She was wonderful.Water...I didn't drink out of the tap in the bathroom, but probably could have. They leave bottled water every day at $1/bottle. I drank plenty out of the tap at the restaraunt and the bar.There is no minifridge in the room, but I didn't miss it.There are two pools, one with a bar, one without. The pool with the bar is where most of the families and couples hung out. It was GREAT!!! Tip the bartenders and they will return the favor. Watered down drinks? I didn't notice, and I like my Cuba Libres. We never had a problem finding lounges with umbrellas at the pool or beach, albeit we were out by 8 each a.m.Food. Was much better than I had expected. It was downright good with plenty of choices and lots of daily variety. (gotta try the frejoles at breakfast!) I was very satisfied in this regard.I have been to PDC several times and have always stayed around 10th street. The beach at the R.C. is at least on par with the nicest in town and I think nic.Dive shop. Very professional and friendly. I went on three dives and I think the prices were reasonable.

We normally go to Cancun but since I'm pregnant, we wanted a more low key vacation. First of all, we loved the Playa Del Carmen area. It exceeded our expectations being not overly commercial and crowded (like Cancun). The town was so charming and a great place to stroll at night. The hotel was great too. Our room wasn't ready for a few hours which was kinda miserable being that it was raining and we had nowhere to go... but after we got in, we forgot about that fiasco. The maids left flowers petals all over the floor, bed, pillows and even in the bathroom. There was a large swan made out of towels on the bed as well. I don't know if they thought we were honeymooners, or just felt sorry for us since we waited on the room a long time (or maybe everyone's welcomed with this). But anyway, we enjoyed the room. It wasn't facing the garden area, but seemed quiet all tucked away. The food was decent. Even though it was buffet style, there was a grill option for every meal... meaning one night they were grilling fish which you could choose for your main entree, another night it was grilled chicken... mornings it was personalized omelettes... so you weren't stuck eating JUST from the buffet. You could get something cooked fresh each meal. We didn't get to fully check out Boticelli's (long story) but heard it was nice. To break up the buffet monotany, we did eat out twice in town. That was wonderful. This is a great place for families and honeymooners (we saw 2 weddings while we were there). We were pleased to not see a bunch of drunk teenagers running around. The topless women didn't bother me... heck, I woulda joined them if I wasn't pregnant. My only advice is: bring a small clock alarm for your room, bring your own shampoo and soap, bring lots of 1's for tips, don't do all the expensive tours when you can take a cab to the same places and do it for a lot less money... and make sure you're chain locked in every night since t (caught us off guard at 8 am one morning). The best part of this hotel is the size (only 200 rooms). It never feels crowded like the some of the hotels just down the beach. Also, if you want, you can hear a \"sales pitch\" a few doors down at the Fisherman's Village (fancy hotel).

It didn't last long. We said our \"no\"s... and walked out with $100 cash, a hammock, 2 t-shirts and a $100 certificate good for their beauty spa.

The shows in the eveninig are fantastic, every night an other show. We made some trips (swimming with dolphins, got to Tulum, snorkeling) All the trips are expensive, 80$ per person is normal. The beach and the sea are wonderfull. We really can recomment this place to you.

This resort completely exceeded my expectations! The beaches are amazingly crystal clear, the grounds and rooms are immaculate (they are always cleaning), the people are very friendly and the weather was beautiful. I had no complaints whatsoever. I had read other reviews about this resort on this website and now think that those who were able to find something to complain about must be incredibly hard to please. The food was yummy, there were several selections on the buffet - including enough healthy choices to keep me pleased (not always an easy feat) and the Italian restaraunt was outstanding. Here's a tip, at least occassionally tip the bartenders and they will go out of their way to please you. Try the Banana Mama drinks; delicious!! We were a group of four, and I did all of the research to decide on where we would stay in the Playa Del Carmen area. The presssure was on me...I was so pleased with this decision. I knew as soon as we left the hotel lobby and started walking toward our room that I had made the right decision regarding choice of resort. As you leave the resort and head toward your room you will walk across a bridge (waterfall to your right) and into a beautifully maintained jungle/garden. At night it is eloquently lit...during the day music plays throughout the jungle. The nightly shows are very entertaining. At the end of the show, let the dancers drag you up on stage...it's fun and you are on vacation! I can honestly say that this has been the best vacation (and by far the most relaxing) that I have ever taken. The beach is breath-taking by day and diehard romantic at night. You won't be disappointed if you choose this place... Check out the \"Isla Mujueres\" tour offered on Mondays (go to the watersports shack on the beach to book). The cost is $65/person and includes all you can drink (liquor as well as soft drinks), all you can eat lunch on Isla Mujueres, swimming with the sharks (relaxpping, spinnaker parasailing, etc., etc. The snorkeling is beautiful and this booze cruise is sure to please. I could go on and on about this resort and all that it offers....

We were traveling with another couple and their number was taken too. My card was in the safe for the entire week and I did not use it at a single place during the trip. The cards were not taken, but the numbers and names were used to make new fake cards that were actually swiped (yes swiped, not punched in) at the same grocery store in Mexico for close to $500 each. My travel companion's fake card was only used at the grocery store, but my fake card was also used at a liquer store for for again close to $500. My concern is not the cards, but the fact that our driver's licenses have our SS# on them and that our passports were also in the safes; every number assigned to our identies may have been stolen. As of right now the hotel has not been of any help and completely denied that there is even a remote possiblitiy the theft occured from the in-room safe.

If I owned the resort, I would find an outfit that had one or two people with communucation skills.(and I am not talking language) It took two trips to the resort manager, and 4 or 5 confrontations and a day and a half before I got to snorkel, and even then they said I had to re-check out the equipment each hour or pay $15. I had the equipment back to re-check it out at exactly an hour, and one butt head came over and started ranting and raving about how I was 10 mins over the hour, and all the while he was showing his butt, he was pointing to the wrong person on the list. When I pointed out to him that my equipment was signed out exactly an hour earlier, he didn't even apologize.They had quite a few sets of equipment, and none of it was new.

But we brought our own pillows, opened the windows, and hardly spent any time in the room (who goes to the beach to stay in the room?), so it didn't really matter. I would definitely recommend that people save their towels and claim your beach chairs early - they go quickly. As for the entertainment, it's what you make of it - if you wanted to get involved, the staff was very energetic and encouraging and seemed to plan fun games/activities for everyone. If you didn't want to participate, you could avoid it. A complaint I read on this site before we left was that drink sizes were small and/or drinks were watered down. Real simple solution - ask for more. The staff was good about honoring requests if you wanted multiple and/or stronger drinks. We did do the resort guided snorkle tour for $30/per person since it was our first time. It was worth the price, but I've heard there's also good snorkling in Cozumel. The ferry to Cozumel is easy to get to and Playa is a fun place to walk around for shopping (I would definitely shop in Playa over Cozumel - Cozumel's prices can be twice that of Playa).

My two older children were 1/2 price ($15.00) and my 7 year old was free. Met many nice people from the United States and Canada.

We were there from 2/15-2/22/03. This place was absolutely beautiful. The grounds are always being cleaned and groomed from early in the morning until at least 11:00 at night! The staff were very friendly and always eager to help if you needed it, especially the entertainment staff, Fernando, Omar, and Carlos, to name a few. They kept our children, ages 12 and 17, busy all day long. They certainly weren't bored at this place. It is very family oriented. They had activities all day long starting with aerobics on the beach and in the pool in the morning. There was always something doing if you wanted to participate. The beach is beautiful and not too crowded like the beaches at the other hotels. This was the best beach compared to the others because you weren't sitting on top of one another. The snack bar by the pool was excellent. They had a good variety of food to eat. Nachos, hot dogs, hamburgers, pizza, etc. and the rotisserie chicken is awesome, but it goes quick so get it as soon as it's done. The drinks were good, but they were watered down. If you tipped them they would put more in for you. The Mango Bar had the best drinks and waitress staff, especially Yara, which is where we went at night located near the theater. Each night the entertainment staff put on a show. They were pretty good. These people work from early morning until late at night. I give them a lot of credit. The buffet in the morning had excellent food. Anything you wanted. We only had bacon one day, though. Any style of potatoes they made were excellent. Botticelli's had excellent food.

The rooms were just okay. The beds were very firm and the air conditioner was very loud. It did smell musty in the room at first because it is very humid there. We just brought oed to work okay. Also, we brought insulated mugs with us to bring to the beach to be filled up with beer or tonic because they give you small glasses for the drinks. You need to put your beach towels on your chairs early in the morning to save them. What you need to do is instead of turning your towels in at the end of the day which in turn they will give you a towel card, bring the towels back with you to the room and put them on the chairs in the morning. When the towel hut opens, turn your towels in and they will give you new towels. We learned this after a couple of days. Check out the Reef Marina on the beach where you get the kayaks, sailboats, etc. to use. They have an express snorkeling that will only cost you $30.00. The boat takes you right from the beach to the reef, you snorkel for about 45 minutes and they take you back. If you book with other tours, they will charge you double to include transportation, lunch, and longer snorkeling that you really don't need. Also, the staff goes to Senor Frog's every Friday night. They will charge you $25.00 per person which includes transportation, open bar and admission. We went on our own and didn't spend nearly as much as that. There was no admission price either.
