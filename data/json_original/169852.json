Not that Mexico City is much to look at. The room was a little shabby but everything worked. Housekeeping was fine and bedding was clean. Desk staff were efficient, if not overly friendly. Restaurant staff were relaxing among themselves sometimes and inclined to behave as though serving us was a chore they'd rather not do. When we left after three nights I asked the porter to call a taxi but was instead taken to a private car, however the ride cost no more than 20% above usual taxi rates and was far more comfortable. Would I stay there again? I'd explore other options first.", "Date": "December 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Panama", "Title": "\u201cStayed for 6 days\u201d", "Author": "FARI_PTY", "ReviewID": "UR119499409", "Content": "This time I got to the hotel because was attending studies nearby. I got there with some partners and they have issues with towels, the first night there was no towels on their room!!! Towels were old, so is the hotel. First they got me a room at 2nd floor, with NO WINDOW, then I asked to change and they got me a room at the 10th floor, that was my error. The room has window but although its on the 10th you can hear all the street noise, and this room was colder than others, and with no heating system and very thin sheets I had a bad time. Also, if you need the free internet, pick a room at 9th floor, 2nd or 3rd, I stayed on 10th and internet didn't reach. Breakfast is ok, with eggs and other stuff. I consider that for the price, they can do better.", "Date": "October 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Augsburg, Germany", "Title": "\u201cThe only positive fact was the staff is very friendly.\u201d", "Author": "Walter R", "ReviewID": "UR118054057", "Content": "Room was rather small, floor carpets old and stained.

The night Friday Saturday 50 kids partying in the corridors until 4 am and from 6:30 am on. Free Internet failed 2 times for hours. Continental breakfast lousy. Coffee machine in the room not working had to be exchanged. Official exchange rate for the Eur was 17 pesos and in the hotel 14. Not possible make phone calls from the room. The so called gym is a joke. I was fooled by an obviously phony traveler report.

We found the accommodations to be very nice. The hotel is far north of the city center, for tourists without a car this could be a problem (if you are not comfortable riding public transit). We had no problem taking the \"Ruta 88\" bus (4pesos) for the 10 minute ride to the nearest metro station \"Polit\u00e9cnico\". The bus was always easy to catch on the corner across the street from the hotel. From the metro you can get close to all places in the huge city. The metro's were a bit crazy (with the crowds) during the evening rush-hour but other than that we found them clean, efficient and safe. We both speak a little Spanish which was helpful in negotiating the public transit. Our hotel room had floor to ceiling glass windows on one side which allowed for a nice view of the neighborhood and a couple of the mountains that surround the city. The free continental breakfast was minuscule, consisting of O.J., coffee and a basket of \"pan dulce\" (sweet breads). The full breakfast buffet as well as restaurant dinners and room service appeared to be unjustifiably expensive in my opinion. We had WiFi internet in our room, it was slow a couple of times but for the most part functioned more than sufficiently for our use. We were very happy with our stay in this hotel and experienced none of the negatives mentioned in other reviews on this site. I must add, having stayed in Quality Inn\u2019s a few times in the USA and always finding them to be a bit substandard, we were very pleased with the over-all quality of the hotel, our room and the service.", "Date": "September 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mexico City, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cNo security in rooms, no heating, terrible service (lies when we got in)\u201d", "Author": "RicardoCamargo", "ReviewID": "UR55216842", "Content": "If you are traveling with kids... forget it... they can go out of the room.

Unusally there is cold wether in the city this days and there is no heating (I wonder if there will ever be air conditioning)! The receptionist also told me that they do not anounce the hotel with heating (another LIE). For the price of a room $90USD it is ourtageous!! Worst place I've ever been.... Don't even try. Soory for the name and the location! We assumed it would be good!
