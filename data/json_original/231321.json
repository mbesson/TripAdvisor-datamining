The receptionists are extremely nice and very very helpful, althought the staff within the restaurant part were quite sullen and never said \"good morning\". The complimentary breakfast was adequate with toast, boiled eggs, cooked meats, cheese, cereals, scrambled eggs, baked beans and bacon but the bacon was awful. Our room was on the second floor overlooking the external emergency exit stairs. The room was very shabby and dated with dubious stains on the carpet. We had to fix the toilet seat back on as it had slipped off the hooks. There was dust on the top of the curtains and tops of pictures and bed frame which had me sneezing all the time. The duvet was very thin as was the pillows and you only get 1 each! The mattress was also thin but didn't seem overly uncomfortable. There was no kettle in the room so good job I always take a travel kettle.

First and foremost, the hotel's best feature is it's location! This was the reason we booked it and the hotel could not be better situated or easier to find. We arrived from the airport by train and it was just a couple of minutes walk from the station, and centrally located for everything else. The staff were friendly and helpful, and as mentioned in previous reviews we did have to pay a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac25 deposit when we checked in. I found it strange that we were asked to hand in our room key to reception every time we left the hotel and had to ask for it back on our return. But it didn't cause any problems. Our double room (107 on the first floor) was shabby looking and dated as I had expected from reading the reviews. That didn't worry me too much though. The room was a generous size and was at the front of the hotel directly above the main entrance. There was a lot of street noise......if you were a light sleeper you'd maybe want to ask for a quieter room, but I'm not and we enjoyed being able to see what was going on in the busy street outside. The TV had a good choice of English language channels, and the free Wi-Fi (which is only supposed to work in the public areas) worked in our room too, so that was a plus. The bathroom was clean and functional, and the shower was hot and extremely powerful - but the shower head was hung far to high on the wall for most people! Luckily my husband is 6'5\" and could get it down for me - I could never have reached it myself! Towels were changed daily, and shower gel, handwash and hairdryer are provided in the bathroom too. Breakfast was basic. There wasn't much choice, but what there was was sufficient to fill you up for the morning, and staff were constantly replenishing the food so nothing ever ran out, even when we were among the last ones in for breakfast. Now.........the mice!! We didn't take food in our room, but they still came looking for it! I'm not particularly squeamish about things like that, and didn't think the odd mouse would bother me. But it wasn't just the odd one.......you could hear them scratching about in the room all night long, and I have to admit even I was a bit freaked out by it! Would I stay here again? If it wasn't for the mice, yes. If you're lucky enough to get a room without any, this is a friendly, well priced hotel for the location.

The window was small and the people below us could climb out of their window and in through mine because of this weird terrace type structure.

You had to keep back from the door as it was rising and falling. Not a propblem however and a very minor criticism. The rooms are small as I suspected, but mine ( and my colleagues) were very clean and made up each day. En-suite was clean and small of course, but okay. There is a wet floor, which means when you shower the whole bathroom is flooded! Again not a problem if you are used to this. Breakfast buffet was everything one would expect from a Dutch Hotel. Continental cuisine with lots of fresh bread, croissants, fruit juices etc and superb coffee, the way I like it. If all you want is bacon and eggs, then they cater for that as well, although the bacon looked a trifle fatty.. All in all a good breakfast and a very large dining room with lots of seating areas. Staff very helpful and excellent security with a free safe in each room and programmable key cards for the room doors. Also 24hour front door service so you can come and go any time of the day or night. I would finally say that if you are looking for a Hotel right in the centre of Amsterdam and you are on a medium budget, then the Delta Hotel is for you.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for our needs\u201d", "Author": "kleaneasy", "ReviewID": "UR117910525", "Content": "We stayed here while on a girl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mini break, arriving before check in the staff were happy to store our cases until our room was ready.

But for most people, this hotel will feel like really roughing it. I paid >$200 to stay one night in an eight person room ( unfortunately the only available room in Amsterdam that night). Positive points - Friendly receptionist. Convenient location for Amsterdam Centraal station and seedy areas of downtown - if that's what you want (red light district and coffee shops). I would say this is an OK flop house for a group of frat house types who just want to be close to the red light district and coffee shops. Sharing a room between eight will minimize costs - as long as you don't care about any degree of amenities and you're not fussy about cleanliness.. The shower was good, albeit a little scary - scalding water at ENORMOUS pressure. I stood outside the shower area to adjust the temperature and once I got it to a comfortable temperature I have to say it was an invigorating way to start the day. Negative points - A grimy room. Most fittings in the room were in a state of disrepair. Lighting was rudimentary - a ceiling light at the entrance of the room and a bare bulb on one wall. There were two table lamps with no bulbs in them. Impossible to work in the room because the lack of working electric power outlets made it impossible to plug in a PC and have a light on at the same time. There is no WiFi working in the room. The bed sheets appeared to be fresh but very threadbare (holes in a few places). Curtains and net curtains were blackened after exposure over years to fumes from the street, I guess. The wooden floor appeared to have been swept, but I found plastic cups and litlte bits of trash that had been left behind by previous occupants . Location is rowdy and noisy until the early hours of the morning - not suitable if you want a good night's rest. There's no soap, shampoo etc. The hotel provides a few scratchy, threadbare towels. Restaurant - The restaurant downstairs serves an adequate free breakfast - some low grade bread, some cereal, a tray of soggy bacon and a tray of dried out scrambled egg. Don't go there for an evening meal. The service is odd - not allowing single travelers to take a large table, even though the place is 75% empty and not offering \"lunch\" items like omelete in the evening. (I don't want to eat a steak just before going to bed, thank you... ). Amazingly, the kitchen managed to botch an order of spaghetti and salad - Ridiculously overcooked pasta and a watered down sauce from a tin, I think. Awful.

A party of young males were checking in before me and 2 of them were allocated a triple room with balcony on the first floor. I feel my request for a room without stair access was ignored. My request for a room change was refused and a subsequent email sent to the management whilst I was there received no response. This is not good customer care. I feel the girl who dealt with me on reception and allocated the rooms was not bothered. There is also an issue about the advertised wifi throughout the hotel. This is NOT the case. The staff roll out the excuse that they cannot deal with the wifi but it is accessible in the restaurant. This excuse seemed well practised. Another American guest in a first floor room told me he had been told the same and he could not access the \"wifi\" from the first floor either. However the restaurant staff were very pleasant and helpful. The housekeeping too was fine as the room was well looked after and I have no complaints at all re that. It was an interior room with a window looking out 1 metre to another wall. Without much natural light it wasn't the best room to allocate to a disabled person who would spend time there resting in between trying to see the city. The position of the hotel is what sells it to visitors I suspect and consequently the management does not have to try too hard. I think there is a great deal of difference between the room quality and one has to play pot luck as to which room one is allocated (with the young blond receptionist it might be more favourable to be a young male for example) Can highly recommend Der Klos for dining....

All the hotel has got going for it is the location. Even saying that id rather catch a tram to the nearest attraction than stay at this hotel again. I dont know how that hotel has not been closed down..and they even asked for a 50 euro deposit when we arrived and they asked jokingly when we checked out if we had broken anything,,haha not amused as theres nothing to break or take....Amsterdam itself has loads to see but very expensive.

The windows were all broken and the wood rotten. The bed just about fit in the room and no space at all around it. you would have to climb in to it from the bottom.

Revolting.The bathroom although tiny was relatively clean. Of course i went to reception and told them i couldnt possibly stay in such a room and the receptionist gave me keys of two other rooms to look at. They were just a fraction better so we choose one. The beds in that place should all be burnt. If the carpet was clean i would probably have slept on the floor they were so uncomfortable. One evening while we were waiting in reception for friends another guest came down waving a rubber mask and demanding to know how it got in his shower. He was furious and said it wasnt there when he left his room in the morning. Weird or what but he wasnt one bit impressed. The only thing you could eat at breakfast was the toast. The scrambled eggs were like rubber and the bacon was swimming in a couple inches of fat. The fruit was tinned with the exception of a basket of oranges and you were lucky to find a cup for your coffee. I was ever so glad to get out of the place. A vending machine in the hotel lobby offered snacks at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.50 each for twix, kitkat, etc. RIP OFF.

I was travelling to the Dam on Sat 12th July 08 which I booked six weeks earlier direct. I wasn't too impressed when I read the reviews for the hotel but with no time left, there was nothing that I could do but have a look for myself. After finding the hotel in a matter of minutes from the train station, we were greeted with the hotel covered in scaffolding. I suppose that all places have to have mainintance done at sometime! We all went into reception and was greeted by a nice guy behind the desk. As we got there at 11am, we had to wait until 2pm to check in. We were told that we could leave our bags in the lobby. Can't say that I was overly impressed with this as my life was in my case!!! But as I had the heaviest bag out of the group I knew it wouldn't go far!! So we left them. We went for a look around town and came back at 2pm. We got all checked in which went fine and got our keys. Seven of us were stopping at the hotel in three different rooms, so I suppose that I had more of a look in other rooms than most of the other people who have been to stay. Me and my partner were in a room on the first floor, the other double on the second floor and the triple on the forth floor. Some other review had mentioned that there were no rails on the stair wells.... well how do you paint them without someone getting varnish on their clothes and complaining?!! You take them off!! All of them were there apart from two. Anyway there was a lift if it bothered anyone that much!! The room was quite nice. It was right down the bottom of the coridor next to the fire exit. The bedroom bit was fine, the view wasn't all that good but you'd expect that as the building are all close together. But your in AMSTERDAM! Your not going to be looking out of your window all the time, if at all. The bathroom was clean with fresh towels. The only problem with the bathroom was the smell from the drains. We had a wardrobe behind the door which did hum abit. As we were only staying for 2 nights, there wasn't much point of unpacking. The room on the second floor was ok too. It was a different layout but all the same it was ok for the weekend. The room on the forth floor was a good size for three people. The only major problem that any of us had was that the screw had come out of one of the room door handles (on the inside). A guy eventually came up but spent more time on the phone than actually fixing the door. I wouldn't have minded but all it needed was a longer screw!!! All the beds that I sat/slept on were comfortable unless you have a \u00c2\u00a31000 mattress back at home! The shower was fine, hot and had a good flow of water. None of this water dripping out of the shower head like I have had back in the UK a number of times! We didn't get around to eating breakfast as we were out all of the Sat night and came back around 9 on Sunday morning. We did however have some food in the restaurant on Sunday night. The steak was really nice. Cooked just right and very lean. Again not something you get that often in the UK. The service etc was great. The only things that bothered me was a slight smell throughout the hotel but its an old place + there are no windows in the coridors + landings and how hot some of the rooms got. My room on floor one was fine but the room on the forth floor got very hot. I would go back to the Delta Hotel again. Maybe the rooms/hotel might be finished when I go back.

On our arrival the receptionists were very polite & helpful, & spoke perfect English. The lift worked(thank goodness as we were on the 4th floor) & our room we found to be clean & adequate if basic. As we had found a very good deal with Easy to Book on line we decided the place was ideal. There was a brick wall as a view from the window but that didn't matter as we were out all day anyway. There is still some building equipment outside the lift for ongoing refurbishment but it wasn't in the way. The buffet breakfast was plentiful with a good selection served in the restaurant at street level. The food was so good we went back for lunch! What do these people who criticise want ? If they want excellence they should pay more. The only downside for us was we had some noisy inconsiderate young lads on our floor who shouted and slammed doors from about midnight till 3 am.

My observations: (1) Our triple room was furnished (or rather unfurnished) in the most basic manner (3 single beds, a TV, a table & chair, 2 side tables in a bare walled room) (2) The bathroom was a reasonable size but there was a noise every 3 or 4 mins from the wall, some kind of a water sound for all the 4 days we were there. There was a liquid soap dispenser at the basin, one in the bath, 3 towels (no hand towel, no floor towel), nothing else. Oh yes, one dead BIG cockroach which remained just under the toilet seat for all the days we were there. (3) First day, came back to see room not cleaned, bathroom not cleaned, towels not changed but too late in the night to get someone to come in as we just wanted to sleep. (4) Second day, told at the reception to make sure room done, but came back to see the same status. Went back to tell the reception before going out to dinner, were assured it would be done, but when we came back past 10pm, it was still undone. Begged for towels and got them.

We are a group of English Ajax supporters and regularly pop over to Amsterdam for the matches, we also normally stay at the same hotel (the Frisco Inn).However on this occasion my friend was clicking around on the internet and came across a great deal for the Delta hotel through the EasyToBook[-] website.It worked out at around \u00c2\u00a325 each per night INCLUDING breakfast (our other hotel doesn't offer breakfast and we pay 45euro's - \u00c2\u00a331 per night).On this occasion three of us were staying there so I booked the triple room.No matter where I go I always read the reviews on Tripadvisor and after reading the reviews on the Delta hotel we had some serious resevations about staying here,especially reports of mice and cockroaches.But the deal was that good we went ahead.The Delta is virtually opposite our other hotel and is located right on the Damrak just a stones throw from Centraal station,the red light area and Dam square. On arrival we were greeted by the friendly reception staff who processed our booking.We were given the triple room (446) at the rear of the hotel on the fourth floor.When we arrived at the fourth floor we were met by a building site.They were refurbishing all the bedroom toilet/shower rooms and ours seemed to be the only one they had finished.There was boxes of tiles,bags of grouting,builders tools everywhere plus all the carpeting was covoured in sheets of paper.We were not too impressed at this point,however,on entering our room we were quietly surprised.It was very spacious with plenty of room around the beds,lots of storge space,a security safe and a television with free PORN channel!! The shower/toilet room, as expected was brand spanking new and was also quite big which was excellent.Water pressure was superb.If I had one grumble I wished the shower had been in an enclosed cubicle instead of being open plan.When you took a shower everything got wet plus if a mate wanted to use the loo he couldn't - unless he wanted a shower sitting on it!! Beds were comfy and all bed linen was clean.Our room had windows that ran full width of the room which let in plenty of light and all the windows opened for ventilation. Breakfast in the morning was the usual euro fair,scrambled eggs,bacon,beans plus breads and cheeses and cold meats etc.We had no complaints here at all.If there is one thing the hotel could really do with is a good clean up on the outside,it does look rather dirty. All-in-all we had a pleasant two night stay and for the money it was fantastic value and would definitely consider staying here again.
