Seminyak is becoming more westernised with upmarket villa developments and familar branded shops moving in - such a shame.

In general the rooms extremely dated and run down and not at all of the standard I would expect from the hotel as described in the brochure. We paid extra for a better room but it wasn't worth the money. It had a dated blue bathroom suite and no balcony, no view and no outside space. We encountered numerous problems at this hotel. After the first night we woke up to find the bed was full of tiny insects. We were understandably horrified and asked to be moved to a different room however they were unwilling to do this. The mattress was changed and the room had to be fumigated. After they had changed the bed covers that evening as I was inspecting the bed (to check for insects) I turned one of the pillows over to discover that it had dried blood on it. Again I was absolutely disgusted with this and the bed covers were changed again the next day. During our stay in this room the toilet made a very loud gurgling noise constantly which made it difficult to sleep. We were reluctant to complain about this as we had already complained about so many things however two days before we were due to leave this hotel the toilet flooded the bathroom. The hotel staff were just going to leave us in a room without a working toilet however this was totally unsatisfactory to us. After we complained bitterly they moved us to another room. This was very inconvenient to us as we only had one day left to go in that hotel.

We have stayed before in the main hotel but found the rooms a bit lacking in character. Preferred the room in Taipan Village, back from the round and upstairs. It was clean, although the linen was a bit tired, and nice in an authentic way. The bathroom was semi-open which I always like. A reasonable size - we got two cots in there along with our super king sized bed and a good range of television channels, including Disney, which came in handy when it rained for two days straight. The buffet breakfast was adequate - great for the kids, although I preferred to wait and indulge in one of the better eating establishments close by. Didn't have a lot of room service, which is expensive considering the local competition, but what we had was ok. Pool area is nice, although can get a bit rowdy if you get a heavy drinking crowd.

Read this We spent a weekend at Resor Seminyak last week. We arrived to stay in one of the deluxe villas around 8pm and were disappointed to find that it was very close to a road where motorcyles were loudly making their way up and down. The bellboy said it wouldnt be too noisy but we asked to change rooms. None were available. There was a big mosquito net around the bed and the bellboy advised we make good use of it as their were quite a lot of mosquitos. There was no net for the baby cot so I called reception to request one. After 3 more calls to chase it up over the next hour, we were finally told the hotel didnt have a net for a baby cot. After we had unpacked and put the baby to bed, we were then told we could move to a quieter room after all. We declined as we'd already unpacked  the baby was asleep, but then had the worst night sleep in the history of man. The baby had to sleep in our bed, under the net, the roaring of the motorcycles was only semi-drowned out by the intermittant clunking of the airconditioner. The next afternoon, we packed up and moved rooms  unpacked again. We ate at the hotel restaurant that night, and had a reflexology massage at the spa afterwards, where unbeknown to us, the baby was being bitten alive by mosquitos in his stroller. He was irritable all night from the bites - another bad night sleep for mum and dad. We left for home feeling absolutely exhausted.The beach is nice, the pool area is good, lots of shade. The restaurant food is standard/average. The initiative of the staff left a lot to be desired, especially that of the ones manning reception when we arrived. I asked to speak to the manager but he/she never seemed to be around.

The restaurants were fairly cheap but upmarket and the food was great, about 10 mins walk you could get to 20 odd eateries serving a range of different styles either indoor air conditioned or out door for the less sticky months.If you are looking for a quiet holiday where you are not too far from the action then I would recommend this place highly, probably suited to those of us who are mildly affluent, not filthy rich but not hard up either.By the way it is Resor Seminyak not ResortKeep bustin' the Juice", "Date": "Jul 14, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR259707987", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "\u9289\u6d96\u5110\u9289\ue0a0\u4f054\u9289\u52ec\u69e6\u9286\u4f75\u5063\u9288\u88e4\u510d\u9289\u66d8\u4f055\u9289\u52ec\u69e6       \u95c4\u59d0\u4f04\u934f\u5908\u5010\u5bb8\ue1ba\u4ed0\u6748\u7b3a\u500b\u6fb6\u0441\u4eb6\u9287\ue042\u511b\u9288\u5e7f\u506a\u9289\u6825\u20ac?/a>", "Date": "Oct 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR515901501", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "cha-chan\u9287\ue1ba\u512a\u9289?> cha-chan\u9287\ue1ba\u512a\u9289?</a> </div>"}, {"Content": "Was will man mehr??   showReview(22950324, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR196539124", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Wunderbarer Urlaub   showReview(22946306, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR304632427", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9288\ue0a0\u5110\u9288\u6dec\u5136\u9289\u714e\u578e\u9287\u6219\u4eb4\u93c7\u6828\u69ef\u9287\ue042\u4f04\u9287\u0446\ue6e6\u5a09\u3126\u5270   showReview(19887374, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR499876722", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9287\ue1ba\u5031\u9287\u70bd\u501e\u5a32\u4ff1\u4f00\u9288\ue042\u5063\u9288\u5e7f\u512d   showReview(19885264, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR708759994", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9287\u64b1\u4f04\u9289\u6d96\u5110\u9289\ue0a0\u4f00\u9287?\u6434\ufe3e\u6d30...   showReview(21800447, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 30, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR218405068", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "0", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9288\ue042\u5142\u9288\u8eb2\u511e\u9289\u7b3a\u510a\u9287\ue1ba\u5139\u9288\u4fbf\u5157...   showReview(19926399, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 6, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR743449314", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "0", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9287\u64b1\u4f04\u9289\u6d96\u5110\u9289\ue0a0\u4f05\u9286\u4f75\u5051\u9289\u6b0d\u5139...   showReview(19920772, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 26, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR723004735", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "0", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9288\ue218\u506a\u9287\ue1bc\u67be\u6971\u638b\u4efa\u9287\ue21e\u4ecc\u9287?..   showReview(19920057, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 1, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR571944521", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "0", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g469404-d450850-r21580832-Resor_Seminyak-Seminyak_Bali.html", "HotelID": "450850", "Price": "$98"}}
