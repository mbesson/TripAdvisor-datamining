The Lantham Hotel will provide you with an ideal location, and that is essentially what you are paying for. In a city where breakfast is not included in some hotels that cost over $300 a night, this hotel is actually quite reasonable; you'll have a clean roof over your head and a place to shower. But let's not get ahead of ourselves.This is a VERY basic place: the shower pressure was so low that I barely needed to draw the shower curtain. I only had to turn on the hot water faucet and even then the water was just warm enough, and the floor was uneven and clearly in need of a good scrubbing. Nonetheless, we slept there with no problems, my husband checked for bedbugs and found none, and the location could not be better! This is a good place for the budget traveler. As far as the staff is concerned, I had no problems with them. As a matter of fact, upon our arrival we were greeted by incredibly friendly staff, which was a good start to our stay.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cCouldn't be happier ...\u201d", "Author": "Stephanie W", "ReviewID": "UR126701917", "Content": "I never really write reviews and usually I'd note in my head the reviews I read but prefer to go and experience it for myself, but after this trip, I feel that I have too as this hotel gets too much negativity for what it is actually worth. What you need to remember guys and girls is that despite this review, everyone is different. What my friend and I experienced in the 9 days here, you would not experience the same, even if you stayed here at the same time we did but I will continue with the review anyway. Me and a friend, both 22 year old female students from the UK, stayed here for 9 days (8 nights) and at first was a bit apprehensive at first because of the reviews however, ignored them and went ahead and booked it through hostelworld.com and we couldn't of been happier. (First time in NYC by the way) We arrived there at around 11pm (NY Time), paid the remainding balance and headed straight up to the room. Despite what other reviews have said, the staff are very friendly and say hello and bye when you leave the building and they speak perfect english. If you needed to ask them questions; where to go to eat, what bars were around etc they were more than happy to help and start a conversation with you, which unfortunately you do not get in many hotels. We stayed in a private double room with a shared bathroom on the 10th floor. We weren't too fussed with this as we were hardly going to be in the hotel anyway and we just needed somewhere to stay. The room was clean and spacious, you had soap and extra toilet roll in the room with a small sink. I wish I took pictures of it to post up, but never mind. They had a sign (The do not disturb ones) that you put outside of your room when you wanted the room tidied and this was done without fail just as you would expect any other hotel; clean floor, new towels, bed made etc. We heard no noise whatsoever despite my friend being a light sleeper. The bathroom again was clean, spacious with toilet and shower facilities. Cleaned everyday. The cleaners again, if we bumped in to them when we were about to go into our room or leave, they would say hello. We were completely happy to leave any thing we bought, in the hotel room while we were out for the day. The hotel environment was good, there were a lot of young mums staying there as well but this didn't phase us, why would it? The location of the hotel was brilliant. When you come out of there, there's a dunkin donuts on to your right on the corner (Excellent and cheap for breakfast) and there's a corner shop to the left of the hotel that does hot food, hot and cold drinks, sweets, snacks, medicine and other necessities you may need. And to the right of the corner shop (5th avenue) was the Empire State Building and a pretty good view of it as well. The Flat Iron Building was also located on your left. Across 5th avenue, further down the street was 28th street subway station, where the trains run from Queens through to Manhattan and then down to Brooklyn or vice versa. We were definitely within walking distance with most locations; 5th ave, Madison Square Garden, ESB, Penn Station and if not, as mentioned earlier you could take the subway as it stopped at all locations and more. Of course at night you have to be a bit more wary (Were in a country on our own) and you had the odd weirdo hanging out at the end of the road, but let's be honest, it is the same anywhere you go. If we had any problems, and I wouldn't even class this as problem, but I need to be honest, was that one that we had to wait for the bathroom to become free to shower and to be honest it wasn't that big of a deal, it happened maybe twice out of the 9 days we were there and in the end my friend decided to use the bathroom on the 9th floor where she did say that shower was more powerful, but nonetheless we still managed to shower. It was a shared bathroom, can't really complain and it's not the hotels fault, people just take a bit longer to shower/go toilet. The second problem and this was for me personally, was that there wasn't a heat adjustment in the shower and the water wasn't that hot. It wasn't cold either but I like to be able to turn the heat up when I shower and wasn't able to do this. But as I said, for me, not that big of a deal. So because of this the overall rating for this is a 4* I guess people were expecting the same level of service and interior design that you would get at The Plaza hotel but I suppose it depends on what sort of person you are. As the saying goes 'You get what you paid for,' and we did get what we paid for and were very happy. If you're like us, not fussy and need somwhere cheap to stay, then stay here. (And I say cheap in a positiive light) I am giving it 5* on the rating criteria as what I got superceded what I expected for the price that we paid. If there was a criteria for the bathroom facilities then yes that would have got 4. We felt safe and would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone who decided to stay here.

Walking to your room is like walking through a prison - going through multiple doors in a narrow corridor with walls painted in dark colours. The room is very small and old. It seems like it was never renovated since it was first built. Likewise, bathroom looks pretty bad too with pipes exposed and bathtub in a very poor condition. I can only imagine what the public bathroom is like. The light was constantly flickering. And the walls are so thin, you can easily hear people next door - people screaming on the phone at midnight and little kids crying throughout the night.

This hotel aint the prettiest in town but for price and location you cant ask for much more. We were situated on the 9th floor and after reading reviews about how poor the elevators were, i was a bit dubious. No need though as both elevators were in fine working order and me and my girlfriend had no problems. We paid for a room with shared bathroom. This wasn't a problem as I first thought it would be. The bathroom was free for us every morning and most times at night. I think we had to wait once. The bathroom was clean with a good shower and served its purpose. For the extra money it costs to have a private bathroom I wouldn't bother. Keep your money and spend it in the city. This hotel was for sleeping, not to prance about in a private bathroom. One thing I would say though is that the rooms should at least have a toilet if they don't have a shower/bath etc. Just a little inconvenient popping across the hall in the middle of night for a pee. But hey, what can ya do?? Room was cleaned everyday with fresh towels and had a TV with 30+ channels. It was very small but it had a bed, clean sheets everyday and it was safe in an excellent location. Thats what we got. On East 28th street you have subways either side only 2 blocks either way. From here its easy to get anywhere and if you like times square which we did then your just 2 stops away. We used the yellow line R train uptown and get off on 42nd street. This literally takes 5 minutes. Its also about a 20 minute walk as well if you like to stroll. Also turn right coming out of the hotel and on the corner you see the empire state building. This again is on your doorstep and just a few blocks away. Also Macy's on 34th street (1 subway stop) or short walk, Flatiron building also round the corner, Broadway, 5th avenue etc. All this is in the heart of Manhattan and this hotel is a perfect base to explore everything from. If you want no thrills, perfect safe location and reasonably priced accommodation then this is the place for you. Save your money for spending in the city and less time in the hotel.

But for more than 1 day of our 4 day stay, the residential elevator was broken, making for slow, crowded conditions on the one remaining elevator.

First, I was uncomfortable finding out that not only is it a hotel but, it is a residential building - even though there was a security guard in the lobby I did not feel safe knowing this. I also felt uncomfortable from the very beginning in my ride up the elevator to my 12th floor room and became even more hesitant walking down the hallway to my room. I felt like I was in a very unfortunate scene straight out of CSI NY. The hallway wasn't well lit and I heard loud televisions and crying babies ( this is not an exaggeration.) Anyway, I got into the room not expecting much at all and knowing that I wouldn't have a bathroom to myself. To make this short, here are the major CONS that made me leave the hotel and check in elsewhere (the American Dreams Hostel which was fabulous for taking me in after midnight and having breakfast in the morning. VERY clean, extremely inexpensive, and in the process of being completely remodeled): - I pulled back the cover on one of the two beds in the very cramped room and the sheets on the bed were so thin that you could see the pattern of the cheap mattress straight through the material. - I couldn't last a full hour in the room because when I sat on the bed or stood on the carpet with shoes on my bare skin was being bitten, relentlessly, by bugs that I'm assuming were bed bugs (I was told rudely by the man at the front desk the next day that they definitely were not bed bugs because I would have been able to see them. Looking them up now, I find that yes, there are bed bugs that are microscopic) or some type of mites or fleas. - This may not mean much to some people but, I just felt unsafe (I am a female, solo traveler) and I had a gut feeling that I needed to leave... The bugs were actually enough for me to leave though. Anyway, I didn't get my money back after speaking to the man at the front desk about the problems with the room. The man also acted extremely non-empathetic concerning my situation. He obviously didn't take pride in his job or the establishment because if he did, he would have worked to make me happy (considering I didn't even stay the night in the room) and he wouldn't have bickered with me whether the bugs in the room were bed bugs or not when I told him that the room seriously needed to be fumigated.

I am not a hotel snob but I do appreciate cleanliness, bug-free rooms, and nice employees.

It is very clean and seemed safe, which are the most important things when booking a budget hotel. The front desk staff are really nice and helpful, especially JP - he is like a concierge you expect to find at an expensive hotel. You are very close to everything either by walking or subway and if you like Indian food you are in luck because you are right next to little India. All of the restaurants and bars in the area are very affordable because you are off the main tourist track by a little bit, which is really nice for budget travelers. The room was a nice size and you have a sink in your room. The bathroom is spacious and clean. The first two nights we had no problem getting into the bathroom when we needed to, the last evening and morning the hotel was busier and there was a wait, which is sort of annoying because there is only one bathroom per floor and it has both the shower and toilette and you cannot use bathrooms on other floors. The bed is not super comfortable, but I might be biased as we normally sleep in a very firm queen size bed. If you don't mind \"springy\" and small, it will be fine. The only other problem was that the air conditioner was pretty loud because it rattled the window when the compressor came on, we remedied this by turning it all the way up so it ran continuously and the loud white noise was constant. We didn't sleep well, but hey, we didn't come to New York for a restful weekend get away.

The room was rather rundown, but it was clean and we were not in there very much at all. We actually cracked up laughing as we entered the room because it was tiny and we had a view of a brick wall!

We were a school group of 44 pupils and 7 staff. On arrival we had a nightmare trying to sort out our rooms, we had been told before travelling to split our kids into rooms of 4, on arrival we discovered there were no rooms of 4, or at least not enough, so we only had rooms for 3, and not enough rooms to go around. I had stressed to our tour company we MUST have staff rooms on the same floor as the pupils to allow us to supervise them properly. I made it clear we would split across more than one floor if absolutely necessary but again must have staff rooms on each floor. On check in the Latham were trying to spread our pupils into rooms across 9 floors - last time i did any maths 7 into 9 just dosen't go. Hotel blamed tour company, tour company blamed hotel, each said the other didnt tell them etc etc. In the end after an awful lot of haggling and heated phone calls with the general manager who wasnt there at the time we just about made everyone fit. 2 of our lads did end up sleeping on the floor of one room though! We then discovered that 1 room had no heating at all and the member of staff in it was freezing for the whole time we were there. Other rooms had heating that would not switch off and was like a furnace.] At about 3am one morning 2 of the lads heard a bang and discovered a big bubble in their ceiling, which then burst and leaked water down on them,. Had to do a rapid room change! Just as well they heard it and woke up or could have been much worse. Turned out to be a burst pipe which knocked out the hot water for a while to the whole hotel. The rooms are not very big, and are quite grubby, not the most comfortable beds either. The hotel is used for social housing, we were aware of that and it didnt cause us any problems apart from a noise issue one night.

The hotel is in a brilliant location - just around the corner from the Empire & Flatiron Buildings. Very close to multiple subway stations with very easy access to the rest of the city.

Yes its old, yes the water pipes crackle at odd hours in the night but it was cleaned everyday and was always smelling fresh when we returned each night. The location is perfect - we had no worries/ issues about walking to/ from the subway stations late at night. We walked back to the hotel from Times Square on New Years Eve and it took about 25 minutes. Subway stations located within a few minutes walk. Great deli across the road. People moan about the lift being slow and yes it is slow - you normally have to wait a few minutes for it to arrive at your floor but it really isn't that much of an inconvenience at all. We had a \"shared\" bathroom which was always very clean - hardly ever had to wait to use facilities which was good considering the hotel was fully booked. The bathroom was clearly recently renovated and was in great condition. The lock on the room door seemed a bit cranky (because the doors are so old) so would recommend to keep valuables locked in case or ask for safety deposit at reception. The hotel does seem to be home to mothers with children but they keep to themselves and do not bother any guests. The hotel staff were approachable and pleasant. Upon check out a couple in front of us had incurred a phone bill of long distance charges which was quite high - as they claimed they did not know calling California would be long distance the manager halfed the bill. All staff we encountered speak good English. At the end of the day you do not go to NYC to spend your time in the hotel so for what you need (somewhere comfy and clean to sleep and shower) this hotel is great. We were a bit weary before visiting the hotel because of the reviews on here but we were very impressed and hope to stay at the Latham during our next visit to NYC.

If you book and expect more you will be disappointed but if you accept that you have paid a very small amount for a basic hotel in an excellent location, then you will be satisfied.

The rooms are cleaned daily and the bedding and towels are changed daily. The rooms are safe and airconditioned. The airconditioning is a little noisy but we were so tired when we returned each evening, we slept easily! Manager and staff at reception are really friendly and were happy to help us when we needed any advice. The hotel does house mums and their children and maybe this should be made more clear. However, the young mums were very quiet, polite and also helpful in my experience. The children were well behaved and a pleasure to talk to. It was great to be mixing with New Yorkers in the hotel! Obviously babies cry at times but i can honestly say i never heard them during the night. In other reviews people have commented on the elevator. Yes, it is a little slow.....what's the rush! Whenever we were seen waiting in the lobby, a member of staff took us to our floor in the staff elevator....we weren't left waiting. Lastly, the location.....absolutely great! Walked out of the hotel and turned left onto 5th Avenue with a view of the Empire State building. Fantastic deli on the corner with internet access as well as great food.

For my wife & I, the complete utilitarian nature of the Latham was ideal. The money that we didn't waste on a hotel we weren't going to see much of, we instead spent on things that matter. We did not have much interaction with the staff beyond simply checking in & out, but they seemed friendly & very quick. There was only one \"issue\" during our stay & they were quick to address it (later in review). There are obviously single mothers & their children who live &/or work there. The children were very well behaved & as far as I could tell stayed on seperate floors from the guests, they had no negative impact on the quality of our stay. Physicallly the hotel reminded me of staying in mid 50s era army barracks. The floors were 12\"x12\" tile & there seemed to be only 2 or 3 colors used in the vast majority of the hotel: white, off-white & national parks brown. The only departure from this decor was in the communal washroom, which obviously has been updated to inspire more confidence, with grey stone tile & newish looking dark tile walls. It comes equipped with one toilet, one shower stall with glass door, one upward opening window for ventilation, one sink with ledge & mirror above. To prevent someone from walking in the door has a slide latch. It also requires a seperate key that you get when you check in. Our actual room was approx 12' x 10' & was predictably white on white white. Walking in directly to the left in the corner is a pedestal sink. To the left & forward there was a end table with 19\" CRT TV with a generic New York skyline print above. Along the far wall there was a dresser with phone on the left, radiator on the right & a window in the center with white vinyl blinds, curtains & an air conditioner. Behind the open door there is a medium-small bar & shelf style closet. Of course in the middle of all this there is a double bed with a generic budget hotel style print blanket & white cotton sheets. The bed itself was softer than I would have preferred but we came to bed tired every night & had no issues getting a good sleep. The radiator in our room worked exceedingly well, so much so that we actually used the fan on the air conditioner to pull air in from the outside to bring it back to a comfortable temperature (my wife & I like it cool). The bonus from this is that we got some nice white noise from the fan. If you require silence to sleep, this would probably be an issue. The in-room sink we found to be somewhat slow in draining, not so much though that it was unuseable. I did not use the TV & the phone, well it's a basic touch tone phone (there was a current phone book in the room.) Our room was across from the communal washroom so you could hear (not loudly) people when they entered/left the washroom. The noise level in general was very low when we had stayed, people seemed to be mindful to not make noise in the hallway & the doors filtered out approx 30-40 decibals. As much as the appearance would lead you to believe otherwise, this hotel is exceedingly clean. There is no bugs, no mold, no random hairs, no grime, it would even be fairly difficult to find any dirt. It would appear as if they clean the blankets & matresses on a very regular basis (which unfortunately seems pretty rare in the hotel industry). The only \"non-clean\" event I had was when I found the toilet in the communal washroom was clogged. The problem was fixed within 10 minutes. As with any communal washroom situation I recommend always wear sandels & keep all toiletries off public surfaces (maybe it's just the Howard Hughes in me.) The location of the hotel is great. It is a short walk either way to the subway lines which is the best way to go any significant distance. The 24 hr. cafe on the corner (Cafe 28) was great. It became a staple for breakfast before heading out for the day & a great place to pick up nearly any drink we could want before going back to our room for the night.", "Date": "August 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Istanbul, Turkey", "Title": "\u201cLocation makes up for everything!\u201d", "Author": "sinanissimo", "ReviewID": "UR35121136", "Content": "Location, Location, Location!

Nor should it be confused with a Marriott Courtyard, Holiday Inn or any other cookie-cutter chain. What it is, though, is a low priced budget hotel for low maintenance travelers. So, if you are one of the many Trip Advisors who criticize hotels for a lack of room service choices, Wi-Fi internet access, chiffon robes or heated toilet seats, then you best look and book elsewhere. However, if you simply need basic accommodations to lay your head \u2013 and save money for Big Apple adventures \u2013 then the Latham Hotel is the place for you. Second to the price is the location; perfectly situated in Midtown off Fifth Avenue and only a few steps away from where King Kong fell for Fay Wray (or Naomi Watts), the Latham guest will find himself or herself right in the middle of America\u2019s greatest city. Sure, there are a few kinks: there is the bland, dimly-lit lobby reminiscent more of a hospital waiting room in some third world nation; there is the ancient elevator that slooooowly takes you to your floor where a maze of narrow hallways await. The room will leave you completely underwhelmed. That said, I found mine comfortable and provided enough room. What amenities there were consisted of a few thin bath towels, a miniscule vial of industrial shampoo and a sliver of plastic-wrapped soap. If you have sensitive hair or skin, it would be practical to bring your own shampoo and soap. And since the building is old and has the plumbing to match, you should let the shower \u2013 which is actually a tub with a flimsy wrap-around curtain - run for a few minutes. There is television with basic cable, but you didn\u2019t come here to watch TV, did you? So, does this really matter? After all, you\u2019re in New York and a short walk away from its\u2019 many sights and sounds. While there is no onsite restaurant for breakfast, there is the Caf\u00e9 28 next door, where you can get an early morning coffee or a late night Panini, since its open 24 hours. If you need a quick pint, there is, a few blocks north, an Irish pub called Rattle N Hum. It offers about 20 draught beers. And a few blocks east is the Lexington Avenue subway. Check it out. Then hit the town with a few extra bucks in your pocket. The Latham Hotel is for people who want to see New York City \u2013 and not 35 channels on TV.

He demanded our passports with no please or thank (i've got no airs or graces and neither does my partner but come on, common courtesy), he then requested my partner pay the outstanding bill which we began to do when my partner queried the final balance, he replied that was the cost and basically end of discussion. My partner produced a copy of the email we had received with the final balance on it and yes we knew they were tax's to be added on but he was saying there was another local tax, which my partner advised he wanted to know why it wasn't included in the bill. The hotel manager appeared and began to patronise us by stating we obviously had got confused and mixed up by euros when 1. euro's is not america\u2019s currency and 2. is not the uk's either! We assured him we were not confused and had received the email which we advised we would show him. The manager left to go home and we advised the male behind the desk we would pay what we had been told and discuss it with the manager the following day. The male advised he would not take any money and requested we 'check our room' to make sure we were 'happy before paying'. I mean what kind of hotel needs to ask you to do that first.... we soon found out why! We were taken to our room by a russian (we think) maintenance guy who spoke broken english and who appeared frustrated. On first impression the room was ok, small but ok, it was really cold and after 5 minutes we realised there was NO hot water AT ALL and NO heating! Now this isn't a cheap cheap hotel, we paid over $930 for 1 week (obviously the current exchange rate increased the cost) and i think it's fair to say hot water is a basic amenity. We went back down to reception and told the male we were not happy with the room and he started to question the maintenance guy as though we were lying, who assured him there was no hot water or heating. We were given a key to room 421, which was even smaller but appeared fine, after 6 minutes of running the water it heated up. Although by this time the maintenance guy was so wound up he was raising his voice telling us 'take the room, it's ok'!. We did take the room we were so exhausted we didn't have the energy to argue. I must admit I am a deep deep sleeper and therefore I never hear anything at night but my partner wakes on every sound but this hotel seriously takes the biscuit! It's not a hotel or a hostel, it's like some kind of single mother accommodation ( and i am not saying there's anything wrong with that) but we paid for a hotel and you expect some kind of noice control but there were kids and babies everywhere, noise constantly (which you expect in the streets of new york) but not in your hotel. The lift never worked, we always took the stairs which we never minded until checking out and had to wait 16 minutes, there was no way i was letting my partner lug our cases down 4 flights of stairs! Anyway we pretty much left around 9am everyday, came back around 5-6ish for a shower (which still took a good 5-6minutes to heat up) and went back out again until at least 1am. But when we were there we did not feel safe, we kept all our valuables on us and kept the do not disturb sign on the door to try and prevent any cleaners in our room (im sorry but we really didn't trust the place). On the 4th day, we came home to have a shower before going out for dinner and i swear to god i almost had a heart attack there was a massive cockroach crawling along the bathroom floor (i was hysterical) my partner killed it, and managed to calm me down. I went out that evening without showering or washing my hair I was so freaked out. Also my partner had bites on the backs of his arms and i had 3 between my thighs, which must have been from the bed. There was a vent beside the window which you couldn't close and it had freezing cold air from outside blowing in, my partner stuffed it with a few of his t-shirts which helped. Now i feel the cold easily but my partner is always warm and he even thought the room was freezing. On our last day were went down to check out at 12 and planned to leave our cases in the hotel until our flight that evening. The baggage is stored in reception and has a kind of guard around it, whilst my partner waited to speak to the female receptionist, i took it upon myself to unclip the guard and push our suitcases in. Now there was a sign on the wall (which i actually never saw and didn't even read afterwards) but the female in reception shouted over at me 'hey you, you can't go in there, get out'. I replied that i didn't realise and she got so annoyed with me saying I had no business going in there and it was against security telling me to 'read the notice on the wall'. I assured her again I didn't see the sign and advised I wasn't stealing anything. By now she was well and truly peeved off. Shaking her head at me, I was now really annoyed and asked 'what her problem was', she replied 'your attitude is my problem'. My partner asked who she thought she was speaking to and she replied 'she gave me attitude so she is getting it back'. She then proceeded to tell us we owed an outstanding balance of $13, which my partner said no chance! It was from the tax which we had queried on the first night, my partner requested she got the manager who came appeared and said to my partner 'sir you have been complaining since you arrived'!! We both were totally shocked and advised we complained on out first night because we had no hot water or heating and hadn't complained since even though we had cold air blowing in our room, cockroaches and constant noise!!!! He initially refused to go through the tax's with us and I queried whether he all guests are treated like dirt and not able to query their bill! Meanwhile the female is still giving us attitude and slagging me off right in front of me! I had lost it by now and told her to shut her mouth. The manager then advised he would pay the outstanding $13 but wouldn't let us leave our luggage, to which my partner told him yes we were!! The manager then advised if we did not leave he would call the police because we were being verbally abusive!! Now im from glasgow and if i had verbally abused anyone they would have known about it. My partner and I are both professionals and we did not at any point use threats, swear or even raise our voices ( we certainly wanted to). We advised him to ring the police, which he obviously thought would have scared us, so he picked up the phone and called them!! Advising the police switchboard he had 2 guests being verbally abusive!! So nowadays, querying your bill and challenging bad service and manners is perceived as being verbally abusive!! The female started giving attitude again, when suddenly the manager must of had a reality check, realising how ridiculous he was ringing the police and told us to forget the $13, he would let us leave our bags and told us to enjoy our day. It was the most ridiculous situation either of us have ever been in! Afterwards talking with my partner we came to the conclusion he must have people complaining all the time and lost the plot. I have not exaggerated at any point and am telling 100% the truth.

The gentleman at the front desk could not speak english well at all and we had to wait 45 minutes for him to create a new reservation! The next morning we approached a new person at the desk and they promtly found our reservation straight away. Irritating.

The shared bathroom was large, and clean on every occaision bar one that we were in it, however this was late at night., and this was just a wet floor form someone showering, and forgot to take their underwear!lol I never had any problems having hot water or access, no que's or anything, i only ever saw one person using it, and this was when i came out. The staff were very helpful,the manager Stephen, in particular was very sweet,helping us book tours and answering some questions, and if we needed anything like hairdryers, directions etc, they helped out straight away. I definately didnt experienceany of the horror stories that other reviews have left! The hotel does have a lot of single mums, however all were polite and friendly and i never felt uneasy sharing a lift with any of them at any time. Its a bit outdated to descriminate against the young mothers just because they live in the hotel, they could just as well be other guests on a longer trip! The lift was slow but i we never had to wait any longer than 5 mins or it. The general deco of the hotel is outdated and yeah you can see paintwork needing redone but it is old.i honestly dont have any major complaints about this hotel, the staff were helpfull the facilities were clean and its location is absolutely fabulous! right beside the Empire State Building, and other major attractions. If you check in to the latham hotel and be realistic about the fact that you have booked a budget hotel and treat the staff the way you would like to be treated yourself, then you will enjoy your stay as i did! TIPs* when getting a taxi from JFK to Manhattan, make sure its a yellow cab, they have a flat rate of $45 we ended up in a black cab who charged $90!! And get the shuttle service back, its only $15 back to the airport and the hotel will book it for you! (well they did at the latham anyway!)

GOOD: - Great location, close to Subway, Great Cafe/Store on corner, and close to a few sights. - Cheap! Well, we didnt think it was cheap for where we came from but for NYC, its a bargain! - Clean, Our room was turned down each morning with fresh towels, linens, etc. No bugs in our room. - Pretty Quiet, we didnt notice any noise from the neighbors or the club next door. - WIFI access - Free in lobby, $9.95 a night in room BAD: - Some staff were rude and acted like we were an inconvenience if we needed anything. - Not everyone is on the same page/lots of confusion. When we first arrived we were told to use the guest elevators, there was no operator in there so we did it ourselves, luckily my husband knew how! Then the next day, we called the guest elevator and the guy came down, opened the door and said \"Yes?\" as if he was confused on what we wanted! Then told us to use the residential elevator. - We need some repairs done in our room, had trouble getting those done. Asked to switch rooms, got attitude for it and lots of flack but they finally obliged. UGLY: - Very old - Pipes are covered in lots and lots of coats of paint as shown in photos here, chips in bathtubs, floors in need of repair, had to ask for tub drain plug. Tub had two different handles and a bolt for the spout.. Things are not attractive in the rooms, very basic standard need. Desperate need of carpet upgrades.

It was definately the most quiet place we have ever stayed while in NY! The mattresses were old but very soft and the pillows were so fluffy just like home.

They warned us not to stay there, and proceeded to give us details why we should find another place. When we reached the hallway, it was somewhat dark, and there was loud music with bags of garbage in the hallway. Upon looking in the room, it did seem rough... and certainly not worth the money.

I voiced my opinion that people should be told that when they book what is advertised as a hotel. The manager informed me that my card would still be charged, and after an exchange of words, I decided I would just dispute the charge when I got home.

New Yorkers were wonderful and helpful. The Best Western Presidential felt so bad for us that they matched the rate of the Latham. We had a wonderful stay in the heart of Broadway and a nice Thanksgiving afterall. The management can continue to counter every negative remark they receive, but the fact is that consumers should be told ahead of time if they are staying at a shelter. There needs to be some truth in advertising. I do not make a ton of money and going to NYC was a once in a lifetime chance. I found it very unfair to be tricked by a business.

Frankly speaking,I was freaked out when I read the bad reviews from various sources regarding the poor service& quality of the hotel. However,after spending few nights there, I find the hotel to be perfect and terrific (now I know those bad reviews were just big lies). The room is not disappointing and when I asked for an extra bed, it was provided free of charge and some one send it to my room less than 5 minutes. The shared bathroom is always clean and working in a good condition. Staff (Reception and housekeeping) are very friendly, polite and helpful. Yes, there are many single mother and children who resided in this hotel but they never bothered you at all(incl. their kids). It's one of the best hotel that I've ever stayed. There's a Chinese restaurant beside it which offer great food at reasonable prices. With it's extreme close location to Starbucks coffee, Burger King,Mcdonalds, Quiznos, Wendys, restaurants, short walk to Empire State building, Macy's, Subway, taxis everywhere, wireless internet access, What more could you ask for for less than USD.100/night in NYC. Nonetheless there are some rooms for improvement such as; -the elevator, maybe the hotel could add another one to reduce the waiting time in the future. -the network for wireless phone is not available inside the room (if it's available, it will be a really weak signal) -water boiler, it would be nice if the hotel guest can boil their own water using electric boiler w/o having to purchase mineral water from 24 hours store at high prices. In a nutshell, come and experience Latham Hotel for yourselves. you will never regret of choosing Latham as your hotel while you are in NYC. Thank you Latham Hotel for making my stay in NYC such a memorable one.

My partner and I recieved a very pleasent welcome from the hotel front desk and someone even took our bags to the room for us. The Room - The room upon entering was very basic but looked clean. The first thing I did was pull the sheets up as I was scared to find bugs like some of the other reviews mentioned. I was happy though when i found brilliant white sheets and a brand new matress. :o) hurrah! I'm a hypo clean person so I even got down and checked under the bed and nooks and crannies for creepy crawlies but was pleased to find nothing. We had a telephone and a TV with lots of channels. One little thing was that the room got quite hot so I did resort to opening the window a little bit on one of the evenings. It was freezing outside so I shouldnt moan really. The Bathroom - Was a bit of a pain not having our own bathroom but it worked out ok. I was scared that it would be dirty etc but it wasnt. it looks exactly like the one on the hotel's website and is very nice. We had to wait a few times for the bathroom but not to long. (in fact one of the times I think I was waiting for nothing as i don't think i was turning the key properly! ha!) Never had issues with their being no hot water which i thought we would have.
