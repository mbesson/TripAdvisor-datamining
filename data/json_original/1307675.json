The Circus is a extremely well located, small, beautiful hotel staffed by some of the most effective staff I have ever come across. Remember this is a small well priced hotel, without the trapping of a five-star bow and scrap place. However the rooms are well designed, well appointed and speaking for the apartment we stayed in (apartment 1) very large. However what set it apart was the warmth and comfort of the staff. They really seemed to enjoy their jobs and offered advice and modern service of the highest standard at all times. So, if you are travelling with children (as we were) or are simply looking for a modern hotel which won\u2019t break you, then this is the place.

Rooms are clean and comfy. All major attractions are pretty much in walking distance but good access to public transport also. Some good restaurants in the immediate vicinity but also ate in the hotel restaurant which was also very nice. Drinks served in the bar were also of good quality. In addition to IPAD in the bar that you can use you also have access to a couple of PCs to surf the net, email, print boarding passes etc. We also did a walking tour with original Berlin walks which was really good, no need to book you can just walk to Weihenstephaner restaurant opposite Hackescher Markt S-Bahn station which is about a 10-15 min walk away, starts at 10.30. Also I would recommend if you are planning on visiting a few museums on museum island to get the museum pass which gets you in most of the museums in Berlin and all of the main ones on museum island. Basically once you visit 2 museums its paid for itself and it lasts 3 days so well worth buying, you can get these at the airport when you come through arrivals just go to one of the tour desks and ask if they sell the Berlin museum pass. There is also a version that gives you access to the metro also but as we prefer to walk and explore the city we didn't get this one. One other point on the circus is there is also a circus hostel just over the road which has a bar in the basement which is cheaper drinks and as you would expect from a hostel a younger and more lively atmosphere. Would definitely choose Circus again if visiting Berlin in the future.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fairfield County, CT", "Title": "\u201cGreat design, excellent neighborhood\u201d", "Author": "PinkiePorkchop", "ReviewID": "UR128079432", "Content": "We stayed at The Circus in 2010 and again for a week in April of this year.

The postives: Location at Rosenthaler platz- close enough to the main sights without being on top of them. 15-20 mins leisurely stroll to the Berliner Dom and Museum Island or about 5 mins on the U bahn. Lots of nice bars and restaurants nearby. Great staff- happy to help with directions, ideas for places to visits, restaurants and bars. Really the best thing about the place. Word perfect english and really puts us to shame. Restaurant- really good food for breakfast, option of buffet or other hot food but both really nice. We ate dinner on the first night and again it was pretty tasty and reasonable. General atmosphere- im not sure how to describe it but there really was a nice laid back atmosphere to the whole place. I guess the modern room decor helps promote this but we both really enojoyed the bar/ restaurant area which was a great place for a drink or even just to relax and borrow the ipad to surf the net. Good music being played, plenty to read or even a bit of live music at the weekend. The negatives: No tea/ coffee making facilities- i know they encourage people to drink tea of coffee downstairs in the bar but it did annoy me not being able to have a cup of tea in the morning/ evening in my actual room. Noise- not external noise as that was well insultated but for some reason the acoustics meant the shutting of other room doors in out corridor seemed to reverberate through our room which was quite off putting at night. Shower door- the bathroom themselves were really nice but our shower door kept opening, meaning the floor got a bit wet. Overall this was a great place, more personal than a large hotel chain, but still offering the majority of facilities and location that you want on a city break.

Which was fine for us at the end of March but I can imagine that in the summer it would be very warm in the room. Due to its location you cannot keep your windows open at night. My second complaint is more like a word of warning. The size of the room is small.

The trams were quite noisy as they passed but weren't as frequent late and night and didn't really disturb us. \u20ac100 per night is cheap for the quality and size of the room, we also had the breakfast which was well worth the \u20ac8 as it set us up for the day. The organic buffet style feast that was on offer was perfect for us and we enjoyed it thoroughly every morning. A selction of cereals, as well as meats and cheeses with fresh bread and fruit and everything in between. Be warned however that if you are after a full cooked breakfast a la England then you won't find it here! The hotel location is perfect also, literally 5 metres from the u-bahn exit of Rosenthaler Strasse and simply found if using the Airport Express train from Schoenefeld......45 mins from airport exit to hotel door! REMEMBER to validate your ticket at your station of departure!! There are little red boxes on most platforms that you must insert ticket to be stamped as there are transport police that check tickets!! We hired monthly passes from the hotel for \u20ac4.50 per day per tickets which gave us unlimited travel and were well worth it. One last tip is to do a bike tour!

The hotel was only a few dollars extra then the hostel so we went with the hotel. The room was so modern! Small and compact but everything was basically brand new. We ate breakfast here in the mornings in the restaurant of the hotel, which are offered at a reasonable price (and I think a lunch or dinner - can't remember, I just remember it was this delicious crusted schnitzel thing). The reason this hotel was so cheap is really because they don't waste money on the unneccessary things. Things like replacing your shampoo/soaps etc daily even though there is plenty left to use, they provide a little area at the front desk with all the shampoo & soap that you can take for free as you need it, rather then have the room cleaners throw them out (hence wasting them) and replace them. The breakfasts were beautiful and fresh, but they wouldn't put out a massive amount of food, just small amounts and replace it as it has been taken (again food not needing to be wasted). Really the concept is quite simple - save money by not wasting anything & you can provide a good hotel at a very good price for guests. The staff at the front desk can help you with any tours you want to do, we had them book us a tour at the last minute (we arrived late in the afternoon & they booked us in for the next day) and it was the best thing we did in Berlin! I highly recommend if you only have one full day (like we did) to do a segway tour - while you will most likely annoy the hell out of local drivers/taxis etc, you will see so much in a short time & not have to walk for hours to see it (I think the total tour was 4 hours???).

It is relatively new, so unsurprising that there are a few teething issues but nothing major at all. One thing to bear in mind is that it is not no.1 on TA for being a great 5* luxury hotel. It is rated #1 because the service is exceptional, much better than many 5* establishments, and the hotel is quirky and accessible. If you are looking for luxury in particular, go elsewhere. Pros: Location: Rosenthaler Plaza, about 15 minute walk to Hakeschter Markt and c.25-30 minute walk to Unter der Linden and all the associated sites. If you are feeling lazy, the U-bahn (line U8) is literally right outside the front door. Service: In many ways, unbeatable. We arrived early and the lovely receptionist switched us to another same standard of room so that we could check in early. The staff were extremely helpful and offered plenty of advice on places to go. Rooms were tidied everyday, and the hotel offered all sorts of extras to make your life easier, such as travel passes and a little piece of paper with directions to the airport, etc. Rooms: We stayed in a Standard Room, which is one up from the Economy. The room was spacious, there was adequate storage space, bathroom was modern and the shower was great! Food: Breakfast is not included in the room price. There is a choice of a la carte and the buffet. Both are great. 8e is probably slightly on the expensive side for the buffet breakfast (good spread of muesli, cheeses, meats, bread, condiments, fruit), but is probably worth paying for the handiness of it being in the hotel, and it did taste good. There are less expensive a la carte and hot food options. Value: Good - 90e a night for the standard room. Areas for improvement: - The bathroom doors are sliding. This is not a problem, except that sometimes, when you are on the outside of the bathroom and someone has just left it, you might like to keep it closed (yes... exactly!). a rubber doorstop would solve this problem. - I had dinner in the restaurant one night and the service was not great. I always believe that even if you are extremely busy, you should not leave the customer feeling that you are rushed. The candle was also not lit and was not addressed (I did try to ask for it to be lit but the waitress very quickly ran away after an order or request - see first point). - Lighting in the rooms are a bit dim and leave the room sometimes appearing kind of cold. Warmer lighting would be more welcoming. - Towels could be fluffier. - Worth flagging to customers when they check in that they have to turn the heating on (heating is great btw, and fully customisable. It just got to the point when I felt really cold when I realised that I needed to turn it on myself...)

It is obvious that they all love their jobs and go above and beyond to help you with anything you may need. They also have great suggestions on restaurants in the area - our two favorites being Transit, just down the street and Schwarzwaldstuben, which is about a 10-minute walk, but definitely worth it! It has typical south German food and the atmosphere is amazing! Be sure to have the hotel make reservations for you at either place because they are both very busy and lively! Rooms at The Circus are on the small side, but spotless and modern. Shampoo, body wash and lotion are all available at the front desk any time you need it. Breakfast is very convenient and available in the hotel's restaurant. You can choose a-la-carte or have the full buffet.

The hotel's restaurant/bar/cafe is also a great place to relax at the end of the day with a drink or two.

There is a subway station right in front of the hotel and you are a 10 minute walk from the central Alexanderplatz train station. In addition you have lots of trendy shops and bars right by the hotel. Just wandering around the hotel you get an excellent feel of Berlin life instead of being tucked away in touristy areas such as the Ku'damm and Potsdamer Platz. And instead of having to take public transportation, many of the attractions are within walking distance. As already mentioned, the staff is extremely friendly and the hotel is set up to be accomodating to their guests with free wireless and Berlin cityguides that you can borrow for free. The hotel has an associated bar and restaurant that serves an excellent breakfast buffet. They also organize walking tours, bicycle rentals and seemed in general to be very knowledgeable about Berlin. Every time we walked past the front desk the staff was giving directions or suggesting attractions to guests. In addition the hotel seems very family friendly ... guests ranged in age from their 20s to 50s including several families with kids. Definitely a hotel that has something for everyone.

This was my first visit to Berlin and it was going to be a fairly long one - 8 nights. Since it was business related, I needed excellent WiFi (and it's free) and the room had to be bright, comfortable and cheerful to work in - which it was. The room also had lots of easy-to-get-at electric outlets. The safe in the desk was large enough for my 15\" laptop, external hard drive, SLR camera, and more. Greatly appreciated was a vase with fresh flowers. Altho solo, I stayed in a double. Great location. The metro is right outside. So is a taxi stand where several were always available. The kiosk around the corner to buy bottled water, juice, etc is open 24/7. Post office (which sells stationery, envelopes) 1/2 block away. ATM machine at a bank also 1/2 block away. Several places to get a quick coffee, sandwich, or slice of pizza, some of which stay open until 4 am. The staff, at reception and the Fabische restaurant, were fantastic, friendly, helpful, enthusiastic, young, spoke excellent English - standouts include Keima, Veronika, and Michael. There was always a bowl of fresh apples at the reception desk for the taking. When I needed a sewing kit, in an emergency, they had one. Had dinner twice at the restaurant and enjoyed it. Since I rarely eat meat, was thrilled the menu included poached pike which comes with delicious vegetables. potatoes, and salad. Sunday evening there was free jazz (guitar and acoustic bass) in the restaurant. In addition to tables and chairs, there are large, comfortable, leather chairs and couches. A couple of nights friends joined me for drinks - and the ambiance is great. As others have noted, the water temperature and pressure in the bathroom sink and shower is excellent. The guest determines the temperature in the room and bathroom, so even though it was chilly outside, the room could be as warm as you like. A nice touch: the do-not-disturb sign for the door is red (stop) and make-up-the-room side is green (go.) The age of the guests varied from 20's to 70's, tourists and business. My room was on the 4th floor, facing the street, and I enjoyed looking at the activity of the street. Although I didn't hear street noise - I kept the windows closed since it was cold outside. I don't know what it would have been like during the summer with the windows open. There was also a feeling of good karma in the hotel. A sign on an exterior hotel wall gives a very short history of the building - that it belonged to the Fabisch family, who were Jewish, and that it ended under the Nazi dictatorship. \"We live and work here with the knowledge of their fate, and in respect for their work.\" In the basement, near the restaurant bathrooms, there is a longer, more detailed, history of the building and the Fabisch family - including that \"Phillip Fabisch's three children were deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp in 1942 and murdered.\" Also, that the basement of the building housed a library \"known as the 'writers' library' because of all the jobless writers who spent time there.\" It is a wonderful hotel, very reasonably priced for what it offers, and I can't imagine staying anywhere else when I return to Berlin.", "Date": "November 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hamilton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLived up to all these excellent reviews\u201d", "Author": "DJKane2006", "ReviewID": "UR121033850", "Content": "Just back from 4days in Berlin staying at the circus hotel.

Let's start with the downsides... as there are very few. - I'm a light sleeper so I specifically requested a quiet room facing the inside courtyard and far from elevators. I was answered by email that my request was accepted. On arrival, I was a bit frustrated to see that my room was right in front of the elevator and facing the very noisy Rosenthaler Platz. There are bars, restaurants, some traffic and a very noisy tram stop. - The breakfast served in the hotel restaurant is 8 euros, which I found a bit expensive for what was offered (no hot meals). That was the only downsides... everything else was just perfect! About the noisy room, I could have complained to the front desk... but I thought I should try it one night to see if I could sleep. To my big surprise, once the door (window) is closed, the room is pretty much quiet... I just heard the tram and with cheap earplugs, I didn't hear anything. I didn't hear anything from the elevator or from the hall. The room seemed very well soundproofed. I slept like a baby on all five nights. On the bright side, I had a good view of a beautiful square and of the TV tower. About the breakfast, I ate there the first two mornings, and then I tried other restaurants. So, no big deal at all! As for the great things about this hotel, there are too many to list them all. I'm a solo traveller so I opted for a single room on the fourth floor. - Very good location! The U-Bahn (U8) right outside the hotel will take you to the Alexander Platz station where you could go anywhere in the city very easily and safely. You can easily walk to some nearby attractions (TV Tower, Museums Island to name a few) - Very modern and clean! Very nice furnitures, flat TV, in-room safe, a \"real\" shower (no bath), no carpet (which is a good thing for me... I don't know if it was real hardwood floor, but it looked like it), comfortable bed. I don't need that but for those who needs that... the room was beautifully decorated. - Very good staff! Every staff I ran into (about 4-5) all spoke perfect English, were very polite, friendly and helpful. They can lend you all kind of stuff. Personally, I borrowed a laptop with Internet access once in a while, free of charge. - Very eco-friendly hotel! Lights in hallways were automatically turned on when you entered and automatically turned off when you exited. We could feel that they were trying to do their best to help mother earth. - Very good price! I paid 70 euros a night, which I find pretty reasonable for the quality of the room and the location. All in all, this is the perfect hotel. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and would definitely stay there again on my next trip to Berlin... and I definitely would not bother trying to find another hotel in the city as I don't think I would find any better place for this same price!", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cOverall a good experience\u201d", "Author": "lovesylvie", "ReviewID": "UR119758717", "Content": "I have some mixed feelings about the Circus Hotel.

Other than that, we literally had no complaints. The hotel brochure in our room suggested a neighbourhood walking tour which we took to our great satisfaction. With so many big sights to see in Berlin, small neighbourhoods can get overlooked. This tour, which should take about an hour and a half, lasted almost four hours for us and included a short side trip to the Berlin Wall Memorial on Bernauer Strasse. We highly recommend this stop and were grateful to the hotel staff for pointing it out. They also recommended the Brewers walking tour, which was one of the best we have ever taken.

Okay let's go through a brief run down in bullet points. Fab staff - nothing too much trouble and more than happy to offer suggestions. U-bahn - the underground literally outside the door so easy to connect to anywhere in Berlin. Top tip 1- ask for the hotels transport pass as it saves u money \u20ac4.50 per day compared to \u20ac6+. It's then charged to your bill. TT2 @ weekends you only need one pass between 2 of you. Breakfast - is a bargain for \u20ac8 each. Wide selections and a good filler for the day until later on. Easy to over eat but I guess you are on hols. Cakes - well I'll leg you treat yourselves to those ;-) Nearby food. Try out Transit - out of the door, turn right and 50yards down on the left you will find a very reasonable Chinese come tapas. Lots of little dishes all very reasonably priced @ \u20ac3 with rice and noodle sides only \u20ac1. Harvest gold a particular fave.\u00a0 Shopping. Rosenthaler str is very boutique like but individual and bring your wallet. TT3 take a left at the Fred Perry shop and follow the road for some great shops. Machima for ladies fashions at reasonable prices was a big hit with the Mrs. \u00a0It leads on to Alexander platz. KaDaWe is a cracking dept store on\u00a0Kurfenstendam\u00a0\u00a0and can be accessed by u-bahn on U2 at the Kurfurstenstr stop. V handy for Steiff on floor 5. We were there for the marathon and what a spectacle. Well organised and flat. No PB but loves the experience. If they do it again well worth getting your time lasered to your wrist band at the asidas store on\u00a0Kurfenstendam. TT4 if you fancy watching Premier league games the Irish Bar under the S Bahn at Hackescher Markt is spot on.

They are passionate with what they do that you feel like you can trust them like friends. How's that? I don't know but that is the Circus magic I'm feeling. I paid an amount that, I think, could not surpass the level of service I experienced and experiencing now.:) I will be back in Berlin again, anytime soon, and surely in Circus too. Right now, I have never thought of trying any other hotels so far.

We enjoyed the Junior Suite @ 100euros a night and breakfast in the Fabisch restaurant depending on what you have was around 16e for two - if you only munch on the muesli and fruit, you get the cheapest deal . Total bill with tea and cake and the odd drink in the evening was 519 euros. We were on the third floor streetside above a crossroads where 5 roads meet which meant the nights were noisy - not helped by what turned out to be a rash of car burning which kept the fire brigade busy rushing around with sirens blaring.But this was more than compensated for by the central location. The Circus is right next to the Ubahn Rosenthaler Platz station and you can walk to the Museum Island in about 15 minutes through the Hackesher Markt. We had supper in the restaurant on the evening we arrrived - like breakfast, the service was friendly and efficient and the food was fine. All the staff we talked to spoke English and were v helpful on the usual questions that all first timers in Berlin like us ask . The room was a good size and the shower a big walk-in which was great and free shampoo gel etc was available at reception. No mini bar but not really needed. The tv was stuck up on the wall furthest from the bed but we did not have much time to watch it. We have stayed in several designer hotels where the priority appeared to be the cutting edge design - where not to like it meant only that you the guest were not hip enough to be there. The Circus manages to balance looking good with excellent guest service. Even the hotel magazine in the room was worth reading and was not the usual self-congratulatory 'aren't we great?' style. Security was good with the room swipe card needed to work the lift - necessary with the ground floor open to the street. Apparently reception is manned round the clock.

We arrived at Berlin Schoenefeld and used the instructions from the website on how to get to the hotel via train. It couldn\u2019t have been easier, the instructions were spot on and we found the hotel in no time and navigated the trains with ease. We got to the hotel early (10.30am) and wasn\u2019t expecting a room to be ready but they said to come back at 11.15am and we could go to our room. We went off for some breakfast and came back an hour later to go to our room. The d\u00e9cor was amazing in the room, we had a Japanese theme (I understand all the rooms are different), the room was spotless, very clean, lovely bathroom and really comfy beds. The hotel promote organic fares and that they are environmentally friendly which I really liked. When booking I asked for a room facing the courtyard which we got and it was very quiet, the hotel is on a busy crossroads so can imagine there would be traffic noise in the outside rooms. The restaurant/bar Fabische (not sure of spelling) adjoining the hotel was lovely, again the d\u00e9cor was amazing, very funky whilst being impeccably clean. The food and drink was gorgeous, we ate there twice out of three days and had a drink in the bar every night. Very very reasonable prices too, a lot cheaper than anywhere else we went. I had pork schnitzel in wholewheat breadcrumbs (\u20ac13) and my boyfriend had the Currwerst (\u20ac6) both were absolutely delicious. I would definitely stay in this hotel again if I return to Berlin, I cant think of one negative comment on it. The location was perfect.

We chose the hotel partly on the basis of good TripAdvisor reviews, and were not at all disappointed. We arrived in Berlin by train and The Circus Hotel was a short taxi ride from Berlin's main train station. In fact, we could have caught a bus to the hotel, as we did on departure. Our room was not huge, but spacious enough, with a very comfortable bed. The bathroom was superbly accessible - one of the best wheelchair accessible showers I have ever seen in a hotel room. The room did not have air conditioning, but room windows were easily opened for fresh air. Our room overlooked the street and a tram line, but even with the window open at night, the tram noise was not disturbing. In fact, opening the window to get a bit of tram noise was helpful to drown out the sound of our neighbours having sex. The room had only a little storage for clothes, but did have a safe big enough for a laptop, with a power outlet inside. The hotel served a buffet breakfast that was organic, very European/German and delicious. The hotel's location was excellent, with tram, train and bus routes passing outside the hotel's front door. There were plenty of cheap eating options nearby too ... Turkish across the road, German self-serve bakery opposite, curry wurst around the corner, and some of the best Thai-style food I have had anywhere (including Thailand) down the road. Staff were friendly and helpful, and able to point us to a nearby laundromat to do a load of washing. My only quibble (and it's a minor one) was that wheelchair access from the street into the hotel was not through the main door, and required the front desk staff to unlock a side door.

ANother extremely handy facility they have at the Circus is the fact that you can borrow laptops, guidebooks, dvd players, ipods and cameras from reception which was a major plus for us. The hotel couldn't be cleaner, and I really liked the concept of an eco friendly hotel, which was really highlighted throughout the building. The one downside was that the weather was absolutely roasting when we were in Berlin, so not having air conditioning was a slight downside but the fan in the room was good enough. I understand that air conditioning goes against the hotels environmental ideals, so we totall understood where they were coming from. LOCATION!!! The location of the hotel was absolutely perfect, surrounded by good restaurants, interesting shops and within short walking distance from Museuminsel etc. What I liked about Mitte was that the atmosphere was so relaxed and laidback, and the people are not judgemental in any way so it was great.

I prefer independent hotels to chains and use them wherever I can, but this place is in a different class. Room: Our 100 euro small suite was spacious, stylish and very comfortable, facing onto a quiet courtyard (which I asked for having read other reviews). There was no minibar; no attempt to sell bathrobes, or CDs; or any other rubbish: just a really well-appointed room, thoughtfully laid out room with radio/iPod dock and a decent kettle. A great touch was the 'magazine' with both hotel amenities and a guide to current events in the city. This had far more time and thought put into it, and was more useful, than anything else I'd seen. Location - in the middle of trendy Mitte, on top of a U-Bahn station and walkable in 10 mins to the S-Bahn. I think most tourists would prefer to be on this side of the city: sightseeing west of Tiergarten is quite limited apart from places easily reached by S-Bahn. Staff & amenities - this is where Circus is a bit different. There is a more informal mood between guests and staff really works. Staff are polite, extremely helpful and very pleasant without the stiff 'yes sir, no sir' that is sometimes regarded as 'good service' whilst being completely insincere. The place feels relaxed and welcoming in a way that a few comfy sofas and a bit of jazz can't generate. We don't normally eat in hotels any more than we've paid for as part of the room, but chose to eat both breakfast and (on one night) dinner here. Food was excellent. But it's the little touches like the laptop loan that make this feel like a home away from home. The organisation started with the hostel across the road and seem to have adopted the best of hostel ethos to a hotel setting. Downsides: we were able to get a decent breeze through our room so weren't bothered by the lack of air-conditioning, but others may be. Also, if you like staff in gold braid and someone to come in at 7pm to put a choccy on the pillow, look elsewhere.

First advice: book way in advance. I tried to rent a room for a weekend getaway in March and they were fully booked till June! We arrived by car. That's a first con: the hotel has no parking and there is no parking garage anywhere near the hotel! You're allowed to park in the streets but you have to use annoying coin machines which take forever and per day you're paying around 30 euro. So, it's not cheap. Besides that, you are obliged to buy some stupid green sticker (around 13 euro) because the hotel is located in the city's \"green\" zone. We were told back home that you could buy the sticker at any gas station. That's not true! And neither in the city itself could we find the damn thing. We decided to give up. Thankfully we weren't fined, but I wouldn't advise trying the same. It could leave you 40 euro poorer. The hotel has resident car permits for guests, so you don't have to pay. But we weren't told that so upon arrival the permits were all taken. I was kinda bummed about that since we booked so far in advance! Fortunately the next day one was available. So: if you're coming by car: buy the green sticker in advance and reserve the permit! We booked the 2 room apartment (apartment 3). We loved how big it was. The bathroom was bigger than ours at home :) We also loved the kitchen. Everything was provided. It even has a little dishwasher! Another pro was how clean everything was, absolutely spotless. Unfortunately there's also some cons: it was bloody hot (30 degrees Celsius) and the room has no air conditioning and is situated on the top floor under a flat roof. It was way too hot at night. We were forced to keep the windows open. The hotel is situated on a busy crossing of two big streets, so we had a lot of noise come into the room, especially of the trams and cars. Besides that, the bed is from Ikea, is a queen size and has a hard, uncomfortable mattress. Due to all of this, we didn't sleep comfortable. Another con was the location. As I already mentioned, it is located at a very busy crossing. However, it is not located as central as I expected in advance. Alexanderplatz and Unter den Linden are around 15 to 20 minutes walking. There is a subway station next door, but you have to transfer at least once to get to all the main tourist attractions. After three days of exploring the city, we got tired of all the subway stopovers. After weighing the pros to the cons, I'm not sure if I would book the hotel again. You'll never find another 2 room apartment for this money (110 euro a night) but at the other hand I'd rather have just one room with a big, comfy bed and aircon. it depends on your preferences whether or not this hotel is gonna please you...", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burley in Wharfedale, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel with Great Staff\u201d", "Author": "TJBrooke", "ReviewID": "UR112861251", "Content": "Whilst we've been to other cities in Germany this was our first trip to Berlin.

We stayed in a Superior Double to the rear of the Hotel. Beds were comfy, shower facilities A1 and the room uniqely decorated. The Fabisch restaurant & bar, within the Hotel, was a terrific venue for both guests & passing trade. We took breakfast in the Fabisch, ate a traditional German meal in the Fabisch & listened to a delightful Aussie folk singer, Coby Grant in the bar. The windows in the Bar are opened up onto the Street in warm weather giving it a cool, cafe bar style. The young Circus Hotel staff are unbelievable. They provide 24 hour reception, are courteous and helpful & provide the best 'tourist/location' advice ever, If they cannot help - they provide you with a free PC or netbook so that you can use their wi-fi to do your own research.

We're both very unique people who like different things. When we came to book a hotel for Berlin, this one looked to fit the bill perfectly. We try to stay away from main chains when we travel. This hotel is just awesome, from the time we booked until the time we left. We started this booking 3 months before we left. We stayed 6 nights in a standard deluxe room, but left at midnight on the 6th night to catch a train to Amsterdam. I asked the hotel to switch to a single room on the last night to save money and they said \"Nonsense, stay in your double room and you can just pay the single rate since you're not staying the entire night anyway.\" The place is ran with common sense and courtesy. We arrived to a bright, quirky, clean hotel. The front desk staff was awesome and spoke very good English. I forgot soap and shampoo and they gave me some of the hotels but also pointed out on a map where the nearest drugstore was. The hallways are dark with funky lights. The artwork and furniture were so different and just added to the uniqueness of the hotel. Our room was spotless and awesome. It was kept clean the entire time we were there. We had a street view on the 4th floor (actually 5th). The noise from the street didn't bother us but if you sleep with the windows up the trams can get kind of loud, but not so loud that you can't sleep. We asked for a fan on our 2nd night for \"white noise\" in the room and it was brought immediately by the staff. The bathroom was awesome with a rain head shower. Location is AWESOME right by the U-Bahn, S-Bahn stops with a taxi stand right outside as well. There is a little \"convenient\" type store in front of the hotel as well as a late night Chinese/pizza place. Loads of bars and restaurants right in the area. Brewers Berlin tours picked right up from the hotel. Let me suggest the Third Reich tour with them. It was great. We did go down for the breakfast buffet one morning and it was great, my husband loved it. The early morning courtyard setting was nice to eat in. The bar next door is a little pricey and the crowd a little older but it was nice. We preferred the bars down the road (Kaffee Burger and White Trash Fast Food). Free Wi-Fi throughout was also a PLUS!!! My husband is already talking about staying here again on our next trip and staying in one of the apartments.

Our highlights of the hotel were: * The vibrant cool room decor - so different from most European hotels - the bed in our pink 'pop art' themed room was comfortable with a great shower and smart bathroom * Discounted metro tickets - the hotel will rent you monthly travel passes at a daily rate (4.50 euros instead of 6.20) which is so useful - ask for them as soon as you arrive as demand can exceed supply! * the very helpful staff, all of whom spoke extremely good English * the breakfast - for 8 euros there is a big choice of healthy organic muselis, breads, yoghurt, fruit, jams, croissants, meats, cheeses etc plus unlimited tea or coffee - really sets you up for the day * the free wi-fi and library of guide books were very handy - we didn't make use of the laptop/iPod loans but why don't more hotels offer services like this? * on checking out, reception offered us a choice of being billed in pounds stirling or euros - saving us a bit of money on the current poor exchange rate plus the standard credit card conversion charge. A very nice touch! * the hotel has lovely common areas - courtyard, dining room and reception area are pleasant and unstuffy areas to hang out. We also liked the way they had given some history of the building, memorializing the previous owner (a holocaust victim) There were a couple of negatives - far outweighed by the many positives but worth noting nonetheless: * we booked an economy room (which did not feel 'economy' at all, it was lovely - see comments above) - however it did face the street and there was tram and traffic noise through the night. We were zonked out after busy days of sightseeing so it didn't bother us unduly, but if you're a light sleeper avoid these cheapest rooms or take ear plugs! * a tiny point about the otherwise great buffet breakfast: included with the unlimited food, tea and coffee was 1 very small glass of fruit juice. It was freshly squeezed but it would be nice if other fresh juice was available as well or they could have at least made the glass they serve you a bigger one. * While the shower gel and moisturizer (which you help yourself to at reception as needed) was very nice the organic shampoo was a bit weird - bring your own! We really enjoyed staying at the Circus - it is terrific value, ideally set up for tourists, right on top of the metro and simply a fun place to stay - we would definitely return!

The room was nice and spacious - modern decor and very bright with 3 big windows. We faced out onto the courtyard so didn't have any traffic noise although the windows seemed to be double glazed so I doubt it would be an issue. The only very minor thing that I found was that they decided to rake the gravel in the courtyard at 8am one morning which made quite a lot of noise and woke us up! We had the windows open as it was quite warm so it was pretty noisy for that time of the morning. Maybe something they'd be better doing in the middle of the day... But a very minor complaint about a very nice hotel! The hotel has a green policy and so doesn't have a fridge/minibar in the room or air conditioning - you can open the windows instead. For drinks they let you order from the bar without charging any room service charges which we thought was a really good idea. They also do a really nice breakfast which is available til 1pm - much better than most places where you're expected to be finished breakfast by 10.30am. Having had breakfast in a nice cafe nearby, we found that the hotel breakfast was very reasonable (\u20ac8 for coffee, juice and a choice of cereals, yoghurt, fruit, breads, meats, cheeses etc) and we ate there 2 out of our 3 days. We also found a really nice Asian tapas restaurant called Transit which is only a 2 minute walk from the hotel - it gets very good ratings on tripadvisor and they are well deserved. The staff in the hotel were all really friendly and helpful and spoke perfect English. We got a rundown of the services in the hotel when we checked in (free wifi, laptops which you can borrow etc) and felt that we could ask any questions we needed to.

The Circus lived up to its billing, and I\u2019m not sure how much more I can add that hasn\u2019t been said already. As others have noted, this is not a luxury hotel. However, it does not feel like a \u201cbudget\u201d hotel, although you will be paying a \u201cbudget\u201d price. It was refreshing for me to stay in a non \u2013chain hotel that did not cater to the business traveler and did not nickel and dime you for every little thing like the big chains typically do. The first thing to note about the Circus is that the location is great. The Rosenthaler Strasse location is in a vibrant neighborhood, with lots of interesting shops and restaurants everywhere you look. It also borders the very trendy Prenzlauer Berg neighborhood where there are lots more interesting shops and restaurants. The Circus has a U-Bahn stop right in front of it, and it is only about a 10 minute walk to the Hackescher Markt S-Bahn stop which is really handy for getting around town quickly and for making a day-trip to Potsdam. I felt that by staying at the Circus you really got to experience Berlin\u2019s more unique neighborhoods and not just seeing the major attractions as most tourists do, without really getting to know the city in depth. The staff at the Circus were very friendly and helpful. Rooms were very comfortable but as others have noted, are on the small side (but with great showers). I had a standard double room. I was by myself; but if my husband had been with me I would have paid the extra 10 euro and gotten the junior suite just to have more room. While a standard double was fine for me, I was happy I did not get a single or Double Economy room. I did not eat in the hotel restaurant; as there were so many places in the neighborhood. I particularly recommend Monsieur Vong, Chen Che (right down the street on Rosenthaler) and Babel about five blocks up on Kastanienallee in Prenzlauer Berg. For breakfast, there is the Back Bakery chain, located across the street. Good selection of pastries, rolls, sandwiches and very reasonably priced. Another advantage of the Circus is the free Wi-Fi and a place to do laundry almost right across the street. The only negative thing I can say about the Circus is there is very poor lighting for reading at night, but I have found this to be true at many other hotels as well. To summarize, a great hotel in a great city! I hope to return to Berlin sooner rather than later and will stay at the Circus again!

We booked it on the strength of all the good reviews it had on here, and were not disappointed. We booked a junior suite, in which a small bed had been made up for our 3 year old. The room was quiet, spotless, spacious and very comfortable. There was plenty of room to park our buggy and store luggage. The shower was a massive hit with us all - our wee one loved standing 'in the rain'. We arrived having had a bit of a disaster - we'd left one of our bags on the train coming into Berlin - but Christopher on reception was so helpful and kind that we were put at ease immediately. As well as giving us toiletries he also contacted the train company for us. We ate in the hotel two nights, and the food, cocktails, beer and wine were fantastic. The only slight down side was that it can be a bit slow, but if you are in relaxed mode this really doesn't matter. The kids menu was perfect - we loved the idea of kids just getting a plate and fork to rob food from the adults. We also had breakfast in the hotel every morning - this is a steal, and great quality. Our three year old loved having bread and chocolate for breakfast, and was never charged for it. The location for families is brilliant. These is public transport on the door step, within 50 metres there is a play ground, and you can walk to the big attractions within minutes, past lots of funky shops. We were also able to borrow a baby monitor so that we could have a couple of drinks in the bar at night while our wee girl was asleep upstairs. The bar has a glass front, so you can just sit and watch the world go by. The hotel staff are really friendly and went out of their way to be helpful - they booked a table for us at a local italian for our last night, made a fuss of our wee girl, and were always keen to have a natter about your day.

The Restaurant Fabisch was so cool i wanted to spend every evening there! And the house white wine gorgeous. The leather sofas were just so inviting. We asked for an asian restaurant recommendation and the guy at the desk recommended Good Morning Vietnam 5 mins away from the hotel on foot. It was delicious! Just past this hotel on the other side was Yam Yam an korean restaurant - also great. As others said they lent us umbrellas and suggested sights etc, I loved the breakfast buffet - great value at \u20ac8 as I ate loads in the morning. It's more continental than cooked which suits me fine. I can't say anything bad about it at all. It was just great.

What I was most shocked about was how true Circus Hotel is to their desire to be a \"green\" hotel. While most hotels in the States are likely just trying to save money by not washing towels, The Circus Hotel actually has renovated its rooms to require key-card access to use the power. We were really pleasantly surprised with The Circus Hotel. I took home the informative booklet on the hotel and shared with all of my friends. We would not even look for a different hotel if we returned to Berlin. Plus, the hotel is located in East Berlin, which is really where we wanted to spend most of our time. It's more affordable and there is a TON to do. The restaurant and bar (Fabisch) in the hotel is also highly recommend. Nothing bad to say about The Circus.

We had Apt 4 in the top floor, which had its pros and cons. There was no need to worry about noise from this busy street corner - even the room to the street was very quiet. Not so nice was the fact that the windows were mainly in the ceiling, which made the apartment dark and a bit cave like. In summer it might get really hot and sticky in there. The bedrooms were nice and comfortable, as the bathroom, but the living area was not adequate for four people. It was far too small, and the fully equipped kitchen took its share of space. This didn't matter to us so much since we spent only two days and mainly used the hotel to sleep. But it seems a bit odd to have such a great kitchen and no space to just relax together all four.

They dealt with the booking efficiently and any questiosn or arrangement of breakfast/arranging transport and arranging chocolates and wine for our room was dealt with quickly and in a friendly fashion.

It was a breath of fresh air that they served breafast until 1pm, althought I didn't want to waste that much of the day, very rarely have I known such accommodating flexibility. At 8 euros each I thought this was a little expensive at first but the breakfast included cereals, bread, cheeses, meats, boiled eggs, a glass of juice and unlimited tea and coffee was actually a great value option with the added perk of being extremely convenient. Also for reference we had an evening meal in the restaurant during our stay and can recommend it; good staff and good value food. My only negatives regarding the hotel was that as someone who likes a cup of tea in bed before going to sleep and when I get up the lack of tea/coffee making facilities in the room was disappointing, despite the convenience of the restaurant being downstairs I didn't want to subject other diners to my brightly coloured PJs! Also the bed was incredibly uncomfortable!

I booked via the hotel's website for their standard double room. We arrived from Berlin Schonefeld Airport and the hotel's instruction on how to get to the hotel from Berlin SXF was really useful and easy to follow. We found the Circus Hotel without any problems. The U-Bahn was located directly next to the hotel and this means it was easy to get around the major sights around Berlin. Saying that, some of the sights were within walking distance from the hotel. However, you might want to use the S-Bahn when the weather is cold! Check-in was quick and easy. All the hotel staff spoke very fluent English and I believe some of them speak french and a few of the commonly used European languages. The staff on duty at the reception desk has great knowledge of Berlin and always keen to recommend something. The hotel loans a day pass to its guest for \u20ac4/day and this allows you unlimited travels on the tram, S-Bahn and U-Bahn network. Just around the hotel are numerous eateries and take-aways so you'll never starve. The hotel has a really cool restaurant that you should check out too (which is also the breakfast area). One thing though, there was no supermarket nearby which meant we couldn't feed our habit of having a nice cup of tea to wind down at night with some snacks. My husband and I are fairly small in built so the room was alright for us. Some guests might find the room to have limited walking space. Otherwise, room was clean and was well-equipped with easy to use radiators. Amenities were available next to the reception counter; in line with the hotel's green policy.

It's most definitely not corporate - businessmen in suits would feel out of place here It's in a perfect location, no more than 15 minutes walk from many of the places you want to see when you first come to Berlin; right next to an underground station and tram stop and 2 minutes from some of the best cafes and restaurants in the City. (Can't speak for the nightclubs as we didn't go to any!)

The hotel is very well located in a nice area of East Berlin and right next to the Rosenthaler Platz Underground station. 2 stops takes you to Alexanderplatz which is a main interchange hub. The rooms are clean with modern furnishings. However be aware that there is no air conditioning! It was very hot when we were there and we were initially given a room facing out on to the road side. Rosenthaler Platz is very busy with traffic and noise all night, so it's not easy to get a good night's sleep with the windows open. The next day we requested to move to a room at the back facing the inner courtyard. This was done for us with no hassle and the next 2 nights we had a very quiet sleep with the windows open. If it's hot when you go I'd say it's worth requesting a courtyard room in advance, albeit our room was slightly smaller than the original one. The service is top notch. All the staff on the desk are very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. You feel that they know good local places and interesting stuff to recommend. There are some great shops, bars and restaurants in the local area especially along Kastanienallee. The Prater Beer Garden is well worth a visit! The hotel also has produced a brilliant free jogging map which was great as I didn't have to work out my own running routes. You can borrow books and I think even laptops from reception. Breakfast in the hotel was good and although the bar/restaurant is not the cheapest there is always a good atmosphere here. Free wifi is also available in the lobby and bar but I don't think it works up in the rooms. The original Circus backpackers hostel is located just across the square.

We spent the first night of our three night stay in a double room located at the front of the hotel, facing out onto Rosenthaler Platz. The rooms are very tastefully decorated and much thought has been given to the environmental impact of the hotel trade. Toiletries are not automatically provided in the rooms but are available free of charge from reception. This does have the effect of making you think about how much you need. The receptionist explained to me that they have to throw away the toiletries left in a room when a guest departs, even if they have not been opened so this small gesture goes a long way to minimise unnecessary waste. The one downside of the double room was that it faced directly onto the main road - a busy junction with 24 hour traffic and public transport (both U-Bahn and S-Bahn are directly in front of the hotel). The heat in the capital city was incredible during the time we were there, reaching temperatures of over 35 degrees during the day and rarely dropping below 25 degrees at night. Thus our dilemma: open the window to let in much needed air (no air conditioning is another feature of this eco hotel) and listen to the S-Bahn trundling past all night; or close the window (excellent sound-proofing) and swelter? We went with the open window option and didn't get much sleep. We spent the last two nights of our stay in a suite. This was a bigger room towards the rear of the hotel and so not affected by noise from the road - equally warm however, although reception will provide an electric fan if you ask. Breakfast each morning is not included in the room rate but is good value at \u20ac8 for the large breakfast with unlimited choice from an excellent continental buffet of fresh breads and pastries, fruit, cereal, yoghurt, cheese, cold meats, tea, coffee and juice. You can also opt for a small breakfast for \u20ac4 with a number of options such as croissant and coffee or fruit and cereal, for example. The hotel also serves meals during the day and on an evening. We enjoyed the evening meal we had, particularly being able to sit out in the courtyard to the back of the building. The staff are welcoming and efficient and are also very knowledgeable on Berlin so do pick their brains for tips, advice and suggestions.

The hotel also offers some great extra services - they can rent you a public transport pass for the day, which is a lot cheaper than buying one yourself. You can also borrow a Berlin-based DVD from the front desk to watch in your room for no charge. We ate breakfast at the hotel's restaurant Fabisch each morning. It was fabulous - a buffet full of healthy, fresh, organic food. And compared to the price of other breakfast buffets we encountered in Europe, it was a steal at 8 Euros pp! The only negative to mention is that the hotel has no air conditioning. During our stay in Berlin, the weather averaged in the mid-30s and our first night was rather uncomfortable as we had to have the windows open to circulate air, but the noise from the street was very loud. Luckily, we were able to move a courtyard-facing room for the remainder of our stay and the heat was much more bearable as we didn't have the noise from the street to contend with and could keep the windows open with no problems. The best tip I could give would be to request a courtyard facing room if you wish to stay in summer!

The Circus is in a great location. I do understand why the past couple of reviews were a little negative so here is what I think. The Good Stuff: Location- The location is great- the trams run by outside and the underground stop is literally outside the door. We found that we ended up walking everywhere as a lot of stuff was within a 15-20 minute walk- i.e. Brandenburg Gate, Alexanderplatz, Oranienburger Strasse, etc The Staff: I found everyone I dealt with to be very professional, friendly and very helpful. All staff were always happy to help and very pleasant with everyone. I felt like they cared about me which is a good feeling. Cleanliness: The whole hotel is very clean. The lobby area is clean and modern, with a lovely outside area where you can eat or have a drink. Our room was spotless too with enough towels etc. The Cost: This is why this hotel is so highly rated- I paid \u20ac90 per night for out twin room, which is amazing when you think of the fact that you are staying in a great location in a large European capital city. I know you can get more luxurious hotels for more money but if you are going on a city break to see that city, then this hotel is perfect. The Bad Stuff: Room Storage: I was surprised to see that there wasnt anywhere to put my clothes. I was able to hang up a few shirts, there were 8 hangars for the two of us. We both left our cases on the floor with most of our stuff in them, which I would have preferred not to do, especially as were on a 4 night stay. Noise: We stayed on the first floor facing the street which was fine. However as there is no air-conditioning we left the windows open. The noise from outside was quite loud- drunk people at night, trams early in the morning, street cleaning etc. Luckily my room-mate had brought earplugs so we used them. I am a heavy sleeper so i slept well but my roommate is a light sleeper and he didnt enjoy his sleep as much. I think if you are a light sleeper, ask for a back room. Air Conditioning: I am very surprised that there is no air-con in this hotel. it was very warm a couple of nights and we had to leave the windows open which is not so good when there is outside noise. The hotel reception gave us a fan on request which did help but its not the same. I liked this hotel and as the time passed, I realised I liked it more and more. We had breakfast every morning and it was always good- very fresh. We had drinks a couple of nights and the cocktails were great, as was the friendly barman. I brought my laptop and the free wifi was very handy too!! I would recommend this hotel for anyone wanting a well-located hotel that saves you money to spend on dinner and tours. If you are looking for luxury or a hotel with all the frills, maybe book the Kempinski instead.", "Date": "June 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, England", "Title": "\u201cWould definitely stay again\u201d", "Author": "Scottie23", "ReviewID": "UR68405737", "Content": "Great hotel in great location and very good value for money.

The hotel is eco-friendly and therefore has no AC (we couldn't keep our windows open since our room was at the front and when they were open the street noise was a bit much) and I only found out when I mentioned this upon checkout that I could have requested a fan!

Luckily, they found a fan for me or I fear it would have been a two-star experience. As has been said, the staff are very nice, and I do admire their green aspirations, but it is a hotel after all, and it is just not a pleasant experience to try and sleep in a very hot, loud room. Not for me anyway. On the plus side, my room service dinner meal was one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten. Really amazing, fresh, very much homemade, organic and where the green concept is really quite successful. I can't say as much for their breakfast buffet, which was surprisingly spartan. However, you can pay extra to get eggs and juice and such, which are in fact quite delicious. Looking at this hotel through the prism of value for money I can see the accolades I guess, but one should never even try to stack it up against any of scores of other higher priced hotels in Berlin which really put it to shame.

Don't get us wrong, we would still highly recommend staying here- it is a great hotel- the staff are absolutely wonderful- just make sure you get a room that overlooks the interior courtyard in the summer- the windows are very sound proof, so this is not an issue in the fall, winter, or spring when you would sleep with the windows closed. Please don't let this review turn you away from this hotel- it really is special and wonderful- the staff really is superb- friendly and very informative- just get an interior room, and everything will be PERFECT.

We had a \"double room\" at 90.00 euros. The room seemed somewhat small. There was enough room to stow luggage and walk around the bed and to the bathroom, but nothing extra. I would consider a \"double economy\" next time for 10 euro/night less. The room was nicely decorated and had plenty of functioning windows, a flat screen TV (very handy as we traveled during the Iceland volcano explosion), and functioning safe. The U-bahn is just outside the hotel door, as well as a taxi stand, and the S-bahn is right across the street. The biggest drawback was the noise level outside the hotel. Rosenthaler Platz is a bustling area with restaurants and outdoor cafes that stay open into the wee hours, as well as a street car that screeches and the hotel is on the ambulance and fire truck route. I admire the Circus for their efforts in being green and not having air conditioning. It was one of the reasons I chose the hotel, however the days were somewhat warm and for air circulation at night we needed to keep a window open. Our room faced the platz so sleeping was often difficult. Lastly, I cannot rave enough about the restaurant Fabisch in the hotel. The seating area has tables and chairs as well as couches and overstuffed leather chairs where one can sip an espresso and watch the world go by after a busy day of sightseeing. Breakfast was marvellous with choices from fresh baked croissants, jam, and delicious coffee to the buffet with breads, cheeses, meats, fruit, multiple types of cereal, yogurt and a juicer with fresh fruit and veggies. There were up to date books, magazines and news papers in the restaurant. As well there was often entertainment in the evening. DJ and finger foods to acoustic guitar etc...

We arrived at the hotel at 10am on my husband's birthday, but check-in was not until 2pm. My husband had contracted a nasty bug and had chronic sickness by the time we arrived at the hotel. I explained this when we arrived, and the concierge was straight on the phone to the cleaner, asking that our room be turned over immediately so we could check in early. I was so grateful for this, and it's just one example of the level of service that comes as standard. That night we were unable to go out, so I ordered room service, and drinks from the bar - how refreshing that to have them in your room is the same price as you'd pay in the bar and restaurant - no different, rip-off menus, or hidden delivery charges. Our room was very clean ad stylishly decorated. t had two large windows facing the main road, but the sound proofing was excellent. Yes at night you could hear the occasional tram, but not enough to wake us up, and we're both light sleepers. The location was perfect, a light stroll to the nearby museums, and it was lovely to learn more about the history of the Jewish quarter, and of the hotel building itself.

Rosenthaler Platz U-Bahn is literally on the doorstep, which is minutes from Alexanderplatz, from where connections to anywhere in the city are plentiful. Rosenthaler Platz itself is a bustling junction, full of eateries, interesting and quirky shops and cafes and transport links.

The room was spacious, spotlessly clean, very well appointed, with an extremely comfortable bed. Worth particular mention was the brilliantly spacious bathroom, which had one of the best showers I've ever experienced. The room itself was full of quirky and individual design elements which had clearly been very cleverly thought out, and made the best possible use of the space available. The staff in the hotel were - without exception - friendly, helpful and informative with no question too trivial to answer. All of course spoke perfect English, which put our pidgin German to shame.

While better value than buying from the station, I never once got the tickets out of my wallet as no one ever checked them? Either it was the time of year or our German counterparts are very trusting! :-) We ate at the hotel once for breakfast and once for an evening meal.

And the shower....amazing. Just what you want after a day of sightseeing in the snow!! The only downside of this room was the noisy tram line just outside our window. But i'm a light sleeper so this affected me probably more than it would the average person. However the excellent quality of the room/hotel far outweigh this small criticism. And a little extra... -Look at the information printouts in your room on your arrival. We went to a really really nice and very reasonable japanese noodel restaurant (Makoto or something like that) they reccomended in the prinout. And it was really close by (5ish mins walk)...also another fantastic restaurant we discovered was about 3 doors down from the japanese place on the same road just on the corner. It does mainly pasta and it was the best pasta me and my boyfriend have ever had. Delicious and very reasonable. - If you enquire to stay here and they say theyre full keep trying.

The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful in a non-patronising way and will try to help in any way possible. It's in a great location; you can walk to a lot of areas of interest but there is also a U-Bahn stop right outside the front door. The hotel bar/restaurant is (like the hotel itself) stylish and modern; it doesn't feel like a typical hotel bar but more like a normal city bar. There is a small evening food menu and the restaurant/bar is also where the breakfast is held, which is composed of German specialities and is fantastic. One small thing is that I would have preferred it if the cost of the buffet breakfast was included in the room cost as \"extra costs\" like breakfast all add up. Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again next time I am in Berlin.

It has a very simple but trendy feel. It wasn't \"plush\" but was clean and modern and had a bit of an \"Ikea\" furniture feel about it. Nice change from hotels in other cities that are looking staid and are a little depressing! - Room - I stayed in a single room on the second floor which overlooked the courtyard. The room was a decent size with everything one needed. It was quiet and the curtains made the room sufficiently dark. The bathroom was nice and most importantly the shower had good water pressure and water remained hot. The only complaint would be the lack of curtains/blinds on the bathroom window although the glass was slighly frosted. The bed was very comfortable and the rooms felt new and trendy. - Hotel staff - very friendly and willing to help. They made you feel like you were simply staying at a friend's place. The staff were consistent across the three nights I was there so I felt like they all kind of had a 'stake\" in the place and cared about the guests. - Internet - they provide loan laptops which you can either take up to your room or use in the lobby. Great to be able to check your emails in peace :) -Location - literally above a Ubahn station. This was great because as a single female traveller I was able to get around easily and felt very safe. The area is great - very close to the Hakshermkt and Mitte is a cool place to stay. You definitely feel like you are in a cool area staying here- mind you at Circus you are more on the edge of things rather than in the centre but I liked that. -Restaurant - the restaurant/cafe in the lobby was nice. Not the fastest servcie but very friendly. Good coffee. -Check in - I arrived earlier than expected and was able to pretty much check in right away which was great. - Feel - the hotel is trying to be eco-friendly which should appeal to young and eco-conscious travellers. This means that bath products are available only upon request (which is fine as most people never use these anyway) I really loved Berlin and despite speaking no German felt \"at home\" here.

The New York Times online is how I found this place. I can only underscore their review.

I really enjoyed the Circus hotel. My only complaint would be something that someone has mentioned. It does get really hot and in order to get air into the room you have to open the windows but the hotel is on a very busy street so you can't sleep unless you have earplugs. The front desk does offer fans but I'm sure that they are very limited. If you have friends that want to stay at the hostel for a cheaper rate, I recommend it. My friends and I were within walking distance of each other and we could also see each other from the windows of the hotel. The only thing is that you can't call each other because the hostel doesn't have phones but you can walk down to the front desk and have them call for free. The Circus hotel helped us with all of plans and answered every question we had. They also tried to get a stroller for the child. Although they couldn't find it they did try. They were very accommodating which made us feel at home. They have so many things available for guests, it is really like you never left home. They have chargers, laptops, cell phones for rent. Anything you could possibly think of. The only thing I rented was the day travel pass for 4 euros (they take 20 euros for collateral). Unlimited travel in 2 zones of Berlin. It was very helpful. The hotel is not exactly walking distance to the main city center but it is only three stops on the underground. Overall, I had a great time in Berlin partially because of the hotel.

As we waited to check out, we witnessed one member of staff patiently explaining everything to the couple in front of us from where to eat to where you can buy cheap shoes. The location, as other reviews have said, is nice and central - it's an easy walk to lots of the main sights, and you are right opposite the underground station. Because it's so new it can, at times, feel like the Circus is still finding its way a bit - for example, they have recently decided to stop providing shower gel and shampoo in the rooms as they found they were throwing so much away. Whether this was done for financial or green reasons is unclear, but it was no hassle to help yourself to bottles from a shelf by reception when you need them. The breakfast buffet is small but fresh and more than adequate. The only minor criticism I can make is that the night-time facilities are not quite as relaxing as they could be, despite the excellent cocktails on offer. It's a combined restaurant and bar, which can make for a slightly formal feel and would probably benefit from being split into two.

The location is really great as well. You can find a lot of restaurants, bars and shops in walking distance from the hotel. If you like to go to other areas, in front of the hotel is the subway and also a tramstop, so it's easy getting around. The hotel itself is not that big, but spacious enough. They have a restaurant, but I only ate breakfast there, so I can't comment on their food. Breakfast though wasn't that great. You can choose one of three types of breakfast. The breakfast in itself is enough, but sometimes you just want to have AND fruit AND bread AND an egg. The \"problem\" is that these three are not in the same type of breakfast, so it's either one or the other. Also, the fruit I got 4 days in a row wasn't of a good quality. The hotel has a really nice little garden, where you can eat your breakfast or have a drink. We had a double room which I found a little bit small, but ok.

After much internet searching I happenened upon The Circus Hotel Mitte and could not have been happier. Although only open since Fall 2008 this is a hotel fully operational and NOT trying to find \"itself. Spendidly, its services and amenities run super-smoothly and exist to make the traveller feel well served and accomodated. (They also run a well-regarded Hostel a block away for those in search of more basic offerings). Unique Qualities: The rooms are cheerful and immaculate: I booked the larger of the Apartments (#4) which has two separate bedrooms and a generously appointed kitchen with living/dining room area; it also had one full toilet with shower and a half bath with toilet only. At 160 Euros it is as expensive as the hotel offers but most other, non-suited rooms are far less in price. The Front Desk is well-versed in answering most tourist requests and offers an exceptionally large reference Library of Berlin-related books as well as Berlin-centric dvds. If only I had the patience to watch the entire 'Berlin Alexanderplatz' 15 1/2 hour saga which featured this neighborhood so indelibly! The hotel's personalized hotel/neighborhood info pamphlet (from which I reference the Doblin quote that introduces my review here) is especially informative. For those staying for several days make sure to rent the 4 euro per person/per day monthly transit passes. Wireless is free and short-term, complimentary rentals of notebooks is available. This is a \"green\" hotel so the FD is happy to give you shower supplies and the like but only as you request. Leave your towels on the bathroom floor if you need replenishment. The complimentary breakfast is blessedly served late (until 1 pm) and there is an option to upgrade to a full 'English' breakfast for a small fee. The restaurant \"Fabisch\" is very consistent and really good- so good that I even went back a week after I had checked out. The bar offerings are very extensive, too. Jared, the Head Mixiologist, is well-versed in the art of artisanal cocktails and very hospitable (he's an American in Berlin). Happily, room service at off-hours is available. On your way to the downstairs restrooms make sure to spend time visiting the micro-exhibit which details the fascinating history of the 'Circus' building and the Fabisch family. It was once a grand department store that anchored the Rosenthaler Platz neighborhood for generations until its ownership met a terrible fate during the Nazi era. Negatives: virtually none. There were no seperate phone extentions in my suite's 2 bedrooms which made wake-up calls a mad dash into the living room. A request to make my safe work went unheeded. At breakfast, they should serve a full coffee or tea cannister rather than relying on the staff to replenish cups (especially if you eat late and the staff is occupied preparing or the lunch service). NONE of these micro issues would prevent me from staying here in the future. A reminder that this hotel is on the U8 U-Bahn line which requires a connection usually at Alexanderplatz if you need to go East-West or West-East. I will always remember my front row \"seat\" to Rosenthaler Platz courtesy of this brillant hotel- sipping my wine, watching the trams languidly roll by as the rain misted over the denizens of Mitte dashing to-and-fro.", "Date": "May 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cCan't wait to return to the Circus!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Hairgood", "ReviewID": "UR29304286", "Content": "Where do I start?
