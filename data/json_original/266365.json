Breakfast was very good with plenty of choice of hot and cold food. So much to choose from we didn't get fed up with the food even after 6 days. Room service very good.

We would have preferred a window looking out, as it was difficult to determine how to dress or what to wear since you couldn't see the weather conditions.

We did not have much luck with the wireless. It seemed to be hit and miss...mostly a miss. The staff was quite helpful with booking tours, making change, etc. We found the hotel to be very quiet at night, but noisy in the mornings with cleaning, guests coming and going, etc. We did not eat in the hotel, but we found many other good food and beverage choices within an easy walk.

In terms of the staff we didn't have too much interaction with them apart from asking if they had a plug adapter which we could borrow which caused some confusion with the chap at reception thinking we were asking for a wake up call! One very small suggestion for the hotel may be that they keep a few adaptors available to hire or borrow as we had to go out to find one and then spend 10 euros on it.

We didn't eat at the hotel so can't help you there.

The management certainly takes the hotel\u2019s condition very seriously. The room we had was of a good size and offered two beds, a desk and chair, ample closet space and a thoughtfully laid-out bathroom.

Now about that breakfast: It is really worth it. The selection of breads, rolls and pastry is ample, platters offer multiple cheeses, three kinds of ham, pate, hard-boiled eggs tomato, melon and pineapple, while hot offerings included bacon, sausage, pork, baked beans and scrambled egg. On our final morning there was even Tortilla (Spanish omelette). There was also fruit cup and multiple juices available, in addition to milk, cereal, coffee and tea. Of the ten breakfasts we had in Spain, this was by far the best. So what didn\u2019t I like? Though the staff was very efficient and professional, they weren\u2019t necessarily inviting or welcoming. It was clear that this was a serious big city hotel and they could be almost brusque at times. My guess is that a dedicated concierge would make a difference as the front desk staff were busy enough without having to give directions and make recommendations. That said, Hotel Regina offered an excellent room in a location 20 minutes walk from the Royal Palace and about 15 minutes from the Prado.

The rooms are nicely furnished overall (was in the updated superior room). The walls are slightly thin and you can hear anybody outside your door; however, this wasn't really much of a problem. There were a couple items that kept me from rating this 5 stars though. Our room (138) was located in what I believe is the back of the building in a small wing with 2 other rooms and a door stating 'Office'. Once entering our room, the quality of wifi went downhill. You essentially had to sit on the toilet or move a chair to that side of the room to get a decent signal. Once you left the room and went close to the middle of the hotel, the signal picked up. For those where wifi isn't a big deal, then this won't matter. For me, I had a bit of work to do while here, so it became somewhat of an annoyance throughout the stay. The second little gripe is that we were right next to the 'Office'. Either somebody in the office or the room next to us on the other side had somebody that smoked during the day. It penetrated our room and we often would walk into our room with a heavy smell of smoke (though you could tell it was from another room). This was also not always the most welcoming scent to walk into the room and smell. Overall, it's a great hotel in a great location. I would stay here again if visiting.

They didn\u2019t really help us much with recommendations or directions, and (unlike the hotel we stayed at previously in Barcelona) never greeted us when we would return to the hotel. The door to our room had a pretty large gap underneath it and my husband and I were constantly being woken up by various noises out in the hall. Many times, we were woken up early in the morning because a business person would be out in the hall way talking on the phone.

Sadly, the noise pollution continued with banging doors, shouting, noisy bin collections in the early hours right outside our windows throughout the whole night. I have stayed in many many city centre hotels and have never been as disturbed by noise as l was here. Having fake wooden flooring in rooms also makes noise radiation throughout the whole hotel much worse.

I just wanted to power my iPad and Iphone for the flight home and a man from the front desk came into the room and, acting as a salesman, began a bidding war for a converter - rip off - now I have an european outlet converter that I had to pay 5 euro for - thanks... -HOT HOT HOT. We are two young adults in our mid-20's and we can pretty much withstand bad conditions, but on our first night, my partner and I woke up in a full sweat. We decided to open up the window - which unfortunately opened up to a service shaft. With very little breeze coming through, and since there were 3 other windows an arm reach away and workers arriving at 7am on the dot, we didn't get much sleep. The room averaged a temperature of about 92 degrees. The next morning we went downstairs to talk to the front desk, this leads me to my next point: -Service: I speak fairly good Spanish, and I always give it my very best, but this staff was rude. The front desk told me that AC does not work in winter, and basically I just had to get over it. An hr later a man came up to see if the unit was broken, he looked at it and said - well the heat is off so that's all we can do, every room feels like this and upgrading would mean more $$ out of pocket... he said this while beads of sweat ran down his face...Also, I had informed the hotel before arriving that we were celebrating our anniversary. Not once were we given a Congratulations, acknowledgment or anything - I'm assuming the people who received a bottle of champagne (which most hotels compliment if you are celebrating something special) were probably staying in something more than a basic room. My suggestion: go elsewhere or upgrade (dish out more money) if you book here. There are TONS of hotels in this area. For $10 more per night I could have stayed at De Las Letras down the street, (I had stayed here 6 years ago and had a terrific time), but I wanted to give a new hotel a try. I'm bummed I went with the latter choice. De Las Letras has an incredible, swanky bar downstairs - we spent more time in this hotels bar than in Hotel Regina's.

Easy walking distance to Puerta del Sol which has hundreds of little tapas bars and restaurantsto choose from - and most are very reasonably priced. Couldn't fault the hotel at all.

I have to say that the location of this hotel really makes it! Its within walking distance to Puerto de Sol which is the main area in the city and where all the shops/restaurant and hustle and bustle is going on. We stayed here for five nights in September. When we arrived at Madrid airport we came outside the airport and if you turn right and carry on until you reach the end of the pavement you will see the shuttle bus there which transports you within walking distance of the hotel for 2euro, excellent value! When we reached the hotel and checked in we discovered we had a room in the attic of the hotel which I didn't even book so this was a nice surprise. I have to say I found the blonde lady at reception less that friendly and to be honest she wasn't very welcoming either. The other staff in the hotel were very friendly and helpful, especially the guys who helped us with our bags. When we reached our room it was big and spacious with a balcony which we utilised alot, it was perfect for having an afternoon drink and also dining. The beds were very very comfortable and most of the time the corridor was quiet. The rooms were spotlessly clean and the bathroom was fabulous, shower was excellent. We had booked breakfast for two mornings in the hotel. I wouldn't recommend this as it was expensive and not great. We really enjoyed having our coffee in star bucks which is literally a minute walk from the hotel. The breakfast there is excellent and half the price of the hotel. There is also an excellent cafe/juice bar called Faborit next door to the hotel and it was amazing!! We got lots of salads there and their smoothies are to die for, I actually got addicted to them during my stay! We dined in an Asian restaurant called the Wok for a few nights and really enjoyed the food there. Its situated around the corner from Star Bucks. We did have room service from the hotel also and the food was good. The one major criticism I have of the hotel is that the ladies begin to clean the rooms very early in the mornings, we were woke most mornings to the sound of the hoover!! It was quite annoying at nine in the morning and especially when you are on holiday. I probably would return to Hotel Regina again and overall we both enjoyed our stay.", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alassio, Italy", "Title": "\u201cGood value in great location\u201d", "Author": "Roberto_NW_Italy", "ReviewID": "UR120871233", "Content": "Just spent three nights with wife and a group of friends; hotel was hand picked based on location, Tripadvisor rating and Trivago deals.

At the concierge desk, the gentleman and female welcomed us warmly. They found our reservation right away and told us that though we were so early, he would have a room arranged within 3 hrs while we take a walk or have breakfast at one of their convenient restaurants on location. I was a bit concerned about the rooms difference, and as I feared, we were not booked for a superior room (I found out about the rooms difference in decoration after booking). Upon inquiring about prices for upgrade, the gentleman was so helpful, and told me not to worry about it. Room was ready at time promised and I have to say that I loved it! My favorite thing is the satellite radio with speakers installed through the room and bathroom which, under some soft music, and their ambient lights in the wall behind the bed, give the room a peaceful and relaxing touch. The satellite radio has music from every imaginable country. The decoration was beautiful; contemporary, minimalistic European . Loved the closet space, and the room is plenty big for an European room! Bigger than 4 stars hotels through the continent. Now, I have seen pics of other rooms, the ones not remodeled, and I can see that their decoration is in pal with their lobby style. I think that their lobby should be decorated in pal with these cute and chic superior rooms. The service in the hotel is amazing! The warmest from any European country I have been to. We had a problem with our safe on day 2 and they were there right away to fix it. Housekeeping is efficient. The hotel is located in an amazing spot! Smack in the middle between old Madrid and sophisticated Madrid, right around Grand Via and a little walk from Puerta Del Sol; walkable distance to amazing neighborhoods and tourist spots. We didn't even use the metro though there is a station right in front. After booking out, we waited for a while for our scheduled airport transfer (booked through Amex Platinum seperately), and unlike other hotels that when you book out you they act like you were never there, the door man was checking on us constantly and when our transport was 10min delayed, he offered to call the company for us, walked me to the front desk, and call they did. The service arrived within minutes. I have to say, I was a bit eskeptical about going to Madrid for a long weekend break and my fianc\u00e9e was the one always nagging about wanting to visit Madrid. But, I am more than glad I did. I also have to say a big part of this great experience in Madrid was thanks to the amazing service and accommodations provided by The Regina Hotel.

I can't say enough about the amazing value and service we received. First, the location is great. We walked nearly everywhere we wanted to visit in Madrid from this hotel, and the closest Metro stop (Sevilla) is right across the street. It's just a few minutes walk to great attractions like Puerta del Sol or the Prado Museum. The Metro is so efficient you can take it to everywhere else you might need to go, including the Atocha train station. We stayed in a standard room on the first floor (they call the ground floor zero) in what looked to be a new wing. The room was lovely. We had a king bed, very modern and clean bathroom with a shower and it was peaceful & quiet. If you're looking for a quieter room, I highly recommend asking to be in the back part of the hotel as we were, as I imagine the rooms on the street side are not as quiet. This hotel also has a nice restaurant, and a more casual cafe in the lobby. The restaurant was moderately pricey, but the cafe was a great place for breakfast or snacks. On the weekends they offered an \"American breakfast\" of eggs, bacon and tea for just 5Euro and you could get toast with a tomato marmalade spread for just 1.50. They also had a variety of tapas ranging from 2-7 Euro. We had dessert and wine in the restaurant one night and it was very good. The last and best thing I'll mention was the service- the front desk staff was extremely helpful and accommodating.

The buffet had several beverage choices: coffee and tea, OJ and other juices, and champagne for those who want mimosas.

I'd asked for a balcony double room on Alcala - of which there seem to be just 3, and we were given our first choice of those (106 - see another reviewer's photos here on TripAdvisor). It was ready when we arrived at 1:00, and was exactly as pictured. The man at the desk shook my hand when we checked in (a first for me). We did not experience noise from the hotel (perhaps because our room was reached around 3 bends from the stairs/elevators). But if you're a light sleeper, the late Madrilenos hours may keep you up in any street-facing room in the city! We, however, just loved being able to hang out our French Window doors and balconette over the convergence of 3 active streets. The views include two gorgeous buildings opposite: one with twin black 4-horsed chariot statues atop, and another with a shining dome top. Sunday nights must be the biggest for partying, as the crowds never ceased until 3:00 a.m., yet it was fairly quiet by 11:00 Monday evening). The Sevilla Metro stop is directly in front of the hotel, and busy Sol square is just a long block away, with Plaza Mayor just a few blocks beyond Sol. Madrid's architecture is just mind-boggling (and we came here directly from Lisbon). Everywhere you walk in the older sections, you'll see gorgeously ornate buildings. It's such a walkable city, and when your endurance lags, the Metro beckons (we shared a 10-trip ticket for 9.3 Euros - got two of those in our 3-day stay). Every square and roundabout has a big fountain, and most have statues or monuments. And Madrfid boasts an embarassing wealth of world-class art museums which we visited in strike-force manner, heading for the rooms with pieces we most especially wished to see (watch your dates if art is your passion - most of the art museums are closed Monday). Restaurants and tapas places abound, with outdoor seating in every square. We usually ate dinner at 8 to 9:00, as the locals don't dine till closer to 10:00. But if you like to eat earlier, you'll find plenty of options open early in the tourist areas. Our room was immaculate with a huge (seemed larger than King) bed and desk with chair plus a lounger, flat screen TV (unused by us) and tile bath with shower and double sinks (this was one of the non-renovated rooms, and we liked it) . There were reading lamps on each side of the bed, and 2 \"body pillow\"-sized bed pillows apiece, plus throw pillows. And, happily for our taste, a sheet and sheet blanket rather than a duvet, which seems too heavy for summer, but appears to be the norm these days. The A/C worked great (and was operational while we were there Sept. 24-27). There were more toiletries here than at some higher ranked/priced places we stayed, including a comb and shower cap in addition to the regular suspects (yes, there was soap, unlike a much earlier review I read). No coffee-making facilities, but a Starbucks 3 doors down from the hotel. Very professional desk service who had our airport taxi waiting as ordered at 7:00 a.m. All this for 82 euros/nite without breakfast (reserved direct via the hotel web site 6 months in advance).

In-room satellite radio, very energy efficient, comfortable, quiet. We can't say enough about this hotel. There's a subway stop just down the street at the gorgeous Plaza del Sol. We shopped, had fantastic food, and bought electrical converters and adapters at a large department store there. Everything we needed was close and convenient. We went to the Reina Sofia Museum, Bernabeu Stadium, Madrid Zoo and Aquarium, the Presidental Palace, cathedrals, Retiro Park and so much more from this convenient location. I searched for hours and hours on Trip Advisor to find the perfect hotel.

The deal included breakfast and a free bottle of champagne. I was planning a vacation in Europe and had planned to pop into Madrid for a day so I thought, \"Why not?\" I made the reservation directly through the hotel and showed up on Thursday, August 4, 2011. The hotel sits at the top of a hill in a fairly commercial area of Madrid. It is a twenty minute walk to the park and the Prado. At the time we were there, the city had shut down various streets because protesters were staging demonstrations a short distance away. Apparently the Pope was coming to Madrid for a visit and the people were not too happy that public funds were being used to facilitate his stay. It was tough to get a cab driver to take us there and it was even tougher for said cab driver to drop us off fight in front of the entrance. It is about a 15 minute cab ride from the main train station where the bullet train arrives. It cost us about 11 euros. IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN THIS MUCH BUT UPON PAYING THE CAB DRIVER HIT US WITH SOME STRANGE TAX AND THEN POINTED TO SOME READING MATERIALS STICKERED TO THE WINDOW. When we walked into the hotel my girlfriend and I were surprised to see people past out on the sofas and chairs immediately to the right of the main entrance. There was a good mix of teenagers, adults and children. They were all completely slumped over catching zzz's. This was a bit strange because it was 2:00 p.m. in the afternoon on a Thursday. This gave the impression that we were staying in a flop house. We tried to ignore this and walked right up to the front desk to check in. This was pretty effortless and we were placed in a room on the first floor at the very end of the hall. The room looked very nice, but there was no windows and absolutely no sunlight or fresh air to allow in. The only thing we had a view of was some kind of stone quarry closet. Past this rock garden of sorts was another hotel room so we had to immediately close the blinds so that they could not see into out room and we in turn could not see into their quarters. It was a bit weird but it did not take away too much from the overall modernity of the room. The shower was powerful and the sink could switch between hot and cold water in a split second. Closet was see-through with a mini bar that came stacked with a nice assortment of booze and soft drinks. The television had a few English channels which is always appreciated. Bed was firm and comfortable. My only problem was with the hotel manager. We had a flight the next day and needed an early wake up call. We were staying in room #140 but the person taking down the information thought she heard room #114. We woke with a quickness the following morning and had to scrap showers in order to make it to the airport on time. This might not have been so rushed or stressful if there was a window or any sunlight to gauge the time of day. But again, we were oblivious to the conditions of the outside world because of the location of our room. Note to travelers, if asking for a wake up call, make sure you have them read the numbers back to you so you can eliminate any possible discrepancies. I can only imagine how pissed off the people in room #114 were when they got a call at 5:30 a.m. Other than that, the hotel is nice and in a good location. It is close to historic monuments, shopping, and quality tapas restaurants. I would stay again, but in a different room and only at the reduced rate we booked through the Travelzoo promotion.

Arrival: We arrived early via the train. It seems to require two transfers from the airport which is a bit of a pain so the bus may be easier but the price was only 2 Euros. The Sevilla metro station is right in front of the hotel which is a big plus. We arrived early and there was no room available but they told us to come back and there should be one available soon and a couple of hours later it was. The room: We had a standard room and it was very basic. Bed with simple bedding, a desk with a 13\" TV and about 2 feet of space on either side of the bed and a small closet but it did have a big safe in it for laptops etc. The bathroom was pretty good size considering the room being so small and it was average as well. There was only one electrical plug in the room that I could find which was a bit of a pain if you needed to charge or power multiple devices. Internet was free and pretty fast so that was a big plus. The rooms are noisy, you will hear everything going on in the hallways etc. If you are a light sleeper, may not be the place for you. Restaurant: The restuarant has two areas, the area they use for breakfast which is the nicer area towards the back of the hotel and the regular restaurant that is toward the front and accesible to the street. Breakfast which was included in our rate (21 Euros each if not) was actually pretty good but not over the top in its offerings but everything we had was fresh and taste good. We also ate at the regular restaurant for dinner once and it was ok but the food is just average but the service is good. Location: That is the huge plus to this property. It is right next to Puerto Del Sol and other popular tourist areas and you have the metro right at your door for other locations you need to go in the city.

The best thing about this hotel is its location - it is simply perfect if you came for attractions and sightseeing and movida. Hotel is located on one of the major avenues, literally few steps away from Puerta del Sol and walking distance from Placa de Cibelles (convenient if you use the A1 bus to/from airport). At the same time it feels like it's not in the heart of the crowd. Another unexpected and pleasant thing was an early check-in - I arrived around 10am and was expecting to wait until official 2 pm check-in, but my room was actually ready, which was very nice. Staff was ver friendly and helpful at all times. And of course it's a very attracting price/value ratio. The room itself was small (but fine for a solo traveller like myself), very clean and convenient. Bathroom looked recently renovated. However, other rooms (apparently, doubles and twins) on the same floor looked newer. Room had an aircon and a fridge (not very powerfull though), plus WiFi and satellite with a few channels in English (usual for Spain). The only downside was the quality of sleep/noise levels.

LOCATION The hotel has a fantastic location, in front of Sevilla Tube station, 3 minutes walk to Sol and Gran Via, main center areas of Madrid. There is a Vips Restaurant and a Starbucks next door, one of the main Theatres \"Alcala\" right in front of the hotel. If you go to Madrid for business or pleasure it\u00b4s the best location for both. There are taxis outside the hotel and bus stop too. ROOMS I prevously had stayed in this hotel and I was given very nice rooms, when you stay make sure they are exteriors. This time they gave me an interior single room, I had to complain to get a change. They have refurbished all the rooms and decoration is nice but the single ones are very small and that kind of hotel can not affors have clients staying there (n\u00ba 126 so small and so dark). Luckily I got a double room on the first floor looking towards the back street, not fantastic but it was ok. I highly recommend to ask for a exterior room overlooking the main street. RESTAURANTS The Buffet Breakfast is very good, no plenty of choice but high quality food. The waiters are very helpful. There is a Bar with a nice wine selection and daily menu. STAFF This is an issue. The guy who picks your luggage is very nice, cleaners are very attentive, waiters fantastic... What a shame about recepcionists! And this is the most important about a hotel. As I mentioned during the past years I have stayed in Regina so I expected to be treated at least in a nice way. First they gave me an interior single room on the first floor, after complaining I had to wait for 10-15 minutes until the recepcionist found a room for me. He wasn\u00b4t helpful and was treating me as if he was making me a big favour because he was going to change my room. I didn\u00b4t felt welcome, all the opposite, I felt very upset and he made me feel very unconfortable. This is a big difference from my pasts visits. The new room he gave me was on the 1st floor overlooking the back street and next to the cleaning room what meant I had a very noisy stay in the hotel. I can not belive he treated me that way and I told him I was a previous guest and I said I would like to have a room overlooking Alcala street (it was only for 1 night, so not so complicated).

I visited Madrid 7 years ago and we were quite a bit away from all the sights so this time I wanted something central. The Regina is very central indeed and in the four days we spent in Madrid, we were able to walk everywhere easily. We didnt take a bus, metro or taxi once apart from getting to and from the airport. Our room was 438 I think so it was situated at the back of the hotel on the fourth floor. There was some street noise from people and bins being collected in the early morning hours which was surprisingly loud considering we were on the fourth floor. Bring ear-plugs if you are a light sleeper. The room itself was spotless and modern. The bathroom was very clean and came with toiletries. The shower itself was very good too with plenty of hot water and great pressure. I thought the bed was very comfortable and I slept very well. The only thing I didnt like about the room was that the window was quite low in the wall which made the room feel dark and the bathroom door was only a frosted glass sheet and didnt lock- you would want to know your room mate well! The staff on reception were friendly and helpful and all seemed to speak great English. There is a restaurant which looked good in the lobby. We didnt eat there as breakfast was \u20ac15 per person which was more than we wanted to spend. We did have a beer and tapas in the cafe at the front of the lobby when it rained heavily one evening and it was good. The location of the Regina is perfect and a major selling point for me. We were able to walk to the museums-Thyssen, Prado and Reina Sophia- in 10-15 minutes. The Puerto del Sol is only a 5 minute walk the other way, with the Royal Palace and the Plaza mayor only a few minutes past that. The Gran Via is around the corner- you will find El Corte Ingles as well as Zara and H&M etc. The Chueca district is behind the Gran Via with plenty of dining and drinking options as well as many boutiques and small interesting shops. This is also the center of Gay Life in Madrid so we ended up here most nights. It was handy only having a short walk back to the hotel at the end of the night. I would recommend Cafe Oliver which is about a 15 minute walk from the hotel for food- we ate there one rainy night and it was lovely. We also tried the Wok which had a few branches in Madrid- the warm duck salad was great. We booked the Regina through booking.com and got a great deal for \u20ac370 for 4 nights for the two of us. I think this was great value for money. I am not sure I would be happy paying over \u20ac500 though so do look around. We were going to take the metro to the hotel from the airport but we would have had to change trains twice. In the end, we took the airport express bus from the airport and got off at Plaza Cibeles. It was literally a straight walk up from there to the hotel- about 6-8 minutes. There are loads of taxis passing if you decide you want to get a ride to the hotel from the plaza. It represents excellent value for money as it only costs \u20ac2 per person from the airport. needless to say, we also got the bus back - it was so easy.", "Date": "June 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cgoog located\u201d", "Author": "rodrigo51", "ReviewID": "UR114809764", "Content": "Friendly staff and good location, near to puerta del sol and el Prado museum.", "Date": "June 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "florida", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location\u201d", "Author": "flausa941", "ReviewID": "UR114776851", "Content": "The rooms were well appointed and clean.

Overall the room and fittings are very sleek, maybe a bit minimalistic but still nice. The 2 big windows opening to the tree-lined street in back are also pleasant. That tree-lined street got quite noisy Friday/Saturday night between midnight and 3am. Even with the windows closed and the sun blinds pulled down you could still hear the goings-on down there. I'm a city dweller so managed to sleep through it, but others might find it too much. While the hotel can't do much about the street, they could install damping door closers on the rooms. With all that tile in the hallways when ignorant guests slam their doors it's like a gun-shot through the whole floor. Woke me up a few times!

This was a wonderful hotel. The room was in the newer, rear section of the hotel and was very modern, clean and quiet. The hotel could not be better situated to access the city. It is nearly directly above the Seville metro station, and is approximately a 10 minute walk to the Prado and Botantical Garden. It is also 300 meters from the Puerta del Sol (and the Sol metro station). For being so well-situated, it is set back from the main street on a bit of a quiet side street, making it feel less hectic and busy than other hotels in the neighborhood. My only quibble (very slight) was the rather tatty carpeting on the lobby stairs. It was old, torn, and shabby looking, and was definitely an outlier for an otherwise fantastic hotel.

The location is truly unbeatable. It's far enough away from the noise of Sol Plaza, but close enough to walk to everything (Prado, etc.). A quick note on getting here: I booked Aerocity, which was a huge mistake. Shuttle was 45 minutes late and then took another 45 minutes to get me to the hotel, when it should have been no more than 30 minutes taking a taxi. I do not recommend the Metro/Sevilla station unless you are familiar with the subway system here because you need to take several transfers (pain in the butt with luggage). Best budget bet is to take the Express Bus to Plaza de Cibeles (2 Euro). Hotel Regina is then a very short taxi ride away (or walk straight uphill and hotel is two long city blocks away on your right hand side). My room was fine (401), but was located away from the noisier parts of the hotel.

Cons: Everything else. The room was dated and had NONE of the necessities...ie. windows, alarm clocks, a hair dryer from this century, a chair, or decent closet space to put your things in. If you choose to stay here DEMAND that you get a renovated (or spring for the \"superior\") room b/c the rooms on their website look NOTHING like what we ended up in. The breakfast is a ripoff at 15 euro per person, per day! There is a Starbucks right on the next corner with much better fare for less money. And be careful with your bill--they tried to double charge us for said crappy breakfast upon checkout. Good thing we had brought along the printout from the booking which clearly stated the price we were quoted already had the ripoff breakfast factored in. Overall, I would not say that the hotel is dirty or horrible in that sense, but for the extremely high price we paid, the room was VERY inferior.

Location. Excellent elegant hotel in the best location. Located just outside metro station Sevilla. Very easy access from the airport with the metro. You simply take line 8 Aeropuerto to Columbia station and there change for line 9 to Principe Vergara and the last change line 2 to Sevilla. Then you get off and you will see the entrance of the hotel. The street is very nice and the neighbourhood is very lively..Puerta del Sol, GRan Via and Plaza Mayor is steps from the hotel, in about 10 minutes walk you will be at most of them. 2. Rooms. At first because we had asked for a quiet room, they gave us one in the opposite of the hotel but we didnt like it much. It was like a tiny box, clean but nothing more nothing less...We stepped down immediately and complained for the room that didn't seem to be double (no way), and they immediately changed us with a better one more comfortable and much nicer at the front of the hotel..Just have in mind that Madrid is very noisy city and outside of the hotel the hotel all day and all night you may hear voices, people dancing and singing in the street. So if you want a nice room with Madrid's view but quiet too, just ask to be in the front of the hotel but on the upper floors, not in the first one.... 3. The restaurant of the hotel is very nice and with good prices and offers...We had a full dinner with a bottle of wine and desert for two people in 50 euros (an excellent dinner). 4. All that I missed from this hotel was that the personnel of the hotel in the reception was always too busy to bother with you.If you should ask them a question then you should patiently wait for their answer but without a smile on their faces...Too tired to help you, maybe...That was the impression given to me...Maybe they werent in their best mood, I don't know...They werent very friendly... 5. Madrid is a very beautifull city, if it was a woman, it was centainly be a spanish femme fatale, and if it was a colour thta should be definitely Red...Very vibrant. Puerta del sol, Plaza Mayor my favourite...Retiro park with the lake, The Palazio Real, the museums, but most of all the city itsself, with excellent buildings all over. 6. Lots of choises around the hotel to eat, drink etc. Just 200 m. from the hotel across the road, you will see plenty of bars, tapas bars to drink your mohito or shangria...Latina also was an excellent choise to eat and drink.... Just next to the hotel was starbaks and another coffee shop and next to the road it was an excellent after to eat, I just dont remember the name... 7. Toledo, is a must see....You don't leave Madrid without visiting Toledo the city of El Greco. All in all Madrid made me feel alive again, I felt in love again....It was an excellent trip I will remember for ever...

However, my room was very, very hot due to unusually warm weather and the hotel's refusal to turn on the air conditioning. Opening my room's (Room 228) window to the airshaft provided little relief and, in fact, made conditions worse because my room was over the kitchen exhaust fan. As a result, with the windows open in the morning my room smelled of greasy cooked mammal flesh and in the evening up return it smelled more strongly of cooked mammal flesh except garlic was added to the aroma. One of my travel mates was in the room across the hall so on our second day of hot rooms we opened both our room doors plus the hallway window and finally got some relief but, of course, couldn't keep the doors open overnight. Oddly, the hallways were about 10 degrees F cooler and the breakfast area had a very comfortable temperature.

The Sevilla metro is literally 4 steps away from the entrance of the hotel and everything was within walking distance! The longest we had to walk was 25 minutes from La Latina back to the hotel because the metro stops running by 1:30am. This is the center most location in Madrid, with tons of shopping, places to eat, and bars to check out. Plaza Mayor, Parque de Retiro, Plaza de Cibeles are a 10-15 minute walk. Puerto del Sol is a 3-4 minute walk. Prado Museum, Reina Sofia, Plaza de Toros and Palacio Real are a few stops from the Sevilla metro stop, costing only 1 euro each way. The concierge was very helful with reservations and suggestions. We will definitely stay at the Regina again!!! TIP: My husband and I went during our honeymoon and I emailed the hotel and requested to have a room with a balcony facing the street because we wanted to have the best view of the city. I also requested for a \"matrimonio bed\" (matrimonial bed) because many european hotels are doubles or twin beds pushed together. When we arrived, we got both the view and a california king size bed! My husband and I LOVE the sounds of the city, so we left our balcony doors open every night. This may be excessively loud for most people due to the city life, but this is easily rectified by shutting the balcony doors and dropping the black out shades.", "Date": "February 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cTicks every box\u201d", "Author": "passionfruit44", "ReviewID": "UR96924254", "Content": "I stayed here for 3 nights and had a very satisfactory experience.

Room decor was sleek and modern. Cons: Room was small (I know, I know.. they are in Europe) but since we reserved a Superior room we expected a bit larger size. Tip, If you do the \"superior\" then the 2 twin size beds will make a king as opposed to the other option of 1 queen size bed. The free wi-fi connection in the room totally stunk. Lastly, a palmetto bug.... yes the type you would see in FL, we saw a huge one in the hallway and had to kill it.

When we left one held up the traffic in order to hail a taxi. Disadvantages; Our room was very hot which was annoying as we booked the hotel because the website advertised air conditioning. Apparently they turn it off during the winter and instead use climate control. However we found it cooler when we turned the climate control off. I am glad I bought a fan with me!.

Hotel Sonya was the hotel we stayed in while in Madrid (for 5 nights) and we were pleasantly surprised at both its comfortable/contemporary room as well as by its prime location. The Room: Given that my wife and I are currently in graduate school, we were looking for budget-friendly hotels for our excursion, while also trying to avoid hostels or shady-looking lodging options. Hotel Sonya was a great way to start our trip. The room was fairly large for European standards (especially since I had read that room sizes are paltry in comparison to rooms in the US). This came as a pleasant surprise since we were preparing ourselves for a smaller room. The room had a desk, an LCD TV, a closet, and an in-room safe. The bed was comfortable, with a firm mattress. Extra blankets and pillows were stored in the closet if desired. The bathroom was modern, with a decently spaced shower (though the door didn't close all the way). Still, the bathroom was large enough for both my wife and I to get ready together in the mornings. The water pressure was nice and strong as well, which was excellent. Free wireless internet was available and the connection was decent. We were able to communicate with our family over Skype and rarely had any connection issues. The Hotel: The staff at the front desk was helpful, and we were able to store our luggage in the luggage room while we waited for our room to be available (we arrived at 8:30 am and couldn't check in until 2 pm). This was nice, as it allowed us to explore Madrid without worrying about our belongings. Granted, we aren't the neediest of individuals when it comes to hotel services (i.e. we don't use room service or laundry services and rarely ever find the need to be constantly asking hotel staff for directions/advice), we found the service personnel to be friendly. There is a lobby area but we didn't really have time to lounge around, and there is also a restaurant (which we didn't use), but they are there for those who like that sort of thing. One thing to keep in mind, especially if you've never been to Europe, is that smoking occurs pretty much everywhere. Of all the places we visited, Madrid was by far the smokiest. You get used to it after a while but it is a shock at first. Location: Just steps from Puerta del Sol, we found the hotel to be extremely well situated. We arrived at Madrid Barajas Airport and made our way to the city center using public transport (Metro). Extremely easy and punctual public transport system. By far the best we have ever personally experienced. Ultra modern, clean, and efficient. If all public transport was as good as Madrid's, the world would be a better place. As you can see, we were super impressed with their system. A metro stop was located just outside the hotel and the puerta del sol stop was minutes away, providing more access to more lines. We were minutes away from the Royal Palace, Gran Via, Plaza Real by foot (and most places are conveniently service by Metro as well). Final Verdict: If you are looking for a well-priced basic room to sleep in while you explore the awesomeness that Madrid has to offer, Hotel Sonya is a great option!", "Date": "November 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxford, England", "Title": "\u201cStop looking and book this hotel\u201d", "Author": "welaj", "ReviewID": "UR86359221", "Content": "As everyone has said a great location within easy walking distance of all the main sights in central Madrid.

Important to mention is that the windows of this room facing busy Calle Alcal\u00e1 were fantastic, blocked out noises very effectively and were equipped with roller blinds. The room was quiet most of the time, but this largely depends on the other hotel guests as noises (conversations, steps etc.) from surrounding rooms can be heard. The only negative aspects were that the room was way too warm (it was November!) - my watch showed 31\u00b0C. The AC had already been switched off and so the only way to cool the room was to open the window. The mattresses weren\u00b4t too comfortable and rather short, but bearable.

Accommodations depend, however, on which half of the hotel you're in. I stayed here at the beginning of our trip and at the end. On the first-leg, our room was in the modern back half.

The view in this section of the hotel is non-existent as the windows face an small opening between it and an office building next door. However, this creates an ideal sleeping environment and you'll never know that you're in the middle of a major city. On our return leg, our room was in the front, older part of the hotel. I can't say that it was a negative experience but here are my complaints. There were three of us and the room was divided into 2 sections. I took the section with the single bed which was in an alcove. The alcove's sole piece of furniture was the bed. There was certainly room for a night stand where a guest could put his or her belongings and, more importantly, a lamp. The only light in that section of the room was the florescent one on the ceiling. It was horrible to have to use this blinding light whenever I needed to see something. Hence, the need for that table. Also, the person using that bed has no view of the TV while lying in bed. Some of us like that sort of thing. The plus, however, was the view (from the main room.)

The hotel could definitely consider a grooming session for them i guess :) The hotel rooms are quite big(we were in the superior rooms) and basic modern amenities are there but the hotel does definitely lack class... somehow when the last renovation happened, i guess they didnt bother to get in a good interior designer or a good architect. Somehow, the rooms do not make any impression on you and when you are paying the kinda rates that the regina charges, you definitely do expect something beyond basic clean rooms. the lobby is quite unimaginiative and its quite onvious that the hotel knows very well that it will continue to sell at the rates they are going at based purely on the location.

I was visiting Spain for the first time with my spouse and decided to choose Regina due to its great location. It is truly situated in a very nice area of Madrid, central to everything - metro (Seville - red line) and close to the Times Square of Madrid, Puerto del Sol. It has grocery stores, restaurants, museums, royal palace all within walking distances. For my LGBT friends, this is right next to the gay area of Chueca - so you can party all night and then walk back to the hotel. As for the hotel, the room we got was a back room #117, so it was away from Alcala street and hence no traffic noise. The room was comfortable and clean when we got there with enough closet space for the 2 of us. The bathroom has a walk in shower with good hot water. There are no bedside clocks here, as is the norm in any European hotel, so if you are used to it bring along a travel watch. The bed mattress was not too great in my opinion, I like a firm mattress and mine was squeeshy. The room is also safe as far as valuables storage is concerned - there is a safe in the room, I just put a lock on my bag when I was out. The rooms are a bit thin-walled, so if you have a noisy neighbor, you may hear it - I was lucky that way. The hotel staff were pretty helpful, we even left our bags there as our flight to Barcelona was much later at night and we had to check out by 12pm. The hotel does have a restaurant, Amayra, that offers a 2 for 1 dinner for about Euro32 that includes 2 courses, appetizer and a dessert. But there are so many tapas bars and restaurants around, you really do not need to eat there. The 2 biggest issues I had with the places were the bad internet service and the heavy smoke smell even in a non-smoking room - let me explain. The internet was WiFi in the rooms but was very touchy - the connection would keep dropping every few minutes and the best times to use it were either early morning or late nights. At peak hours, just about forget it!! I believe that any modern hotel should have good reliable internet service - if not do not advertize that you do have it. Secondly, the room I was in was a non-smoking room. However, I do not think all the rooms on the floor were. Also there was a lounge area just next to the room where people would light up. So the smoke would just permeate everywhere. At night I placed a damp towel next to the edge of my room door to keep the smoke out - it helped a bit. They need to organize the zones better so that it is truly a non-smoking room.

As far as the noise is concerned, it would have been a problem if we were staying for a week or so but being we were only there 4 nights it wasn't so bad. And if you tell the staff, they do try to accomodate and help lessen the noise (they switched us to different room since our first room was facing outside street and I also heard them telling the late night drinkers in the hallway to kindly go to their rooms). To make up for the disruption, they did give us complimentary buffet breakfast one of the days which was nice. All in all, I would stay here again but would definitely make sure to get an inside room. One more thing, I know we were in a non-smoking room but you can still smell smoke a little bit when others are smoking in their rooms. But I think I am a bit more particular about second-hand smoke than the average person. Also we got a great deal on the hotel for less than 100USD/night so I think we came out pretty well. The only reason I didn't give this hotel 5 stars is bc of the noise issue.", "Date": "March 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cExcellent staff, Restaurant, Location and excellent value.\u201d", "Author": "Sabicas", "ReviewID": "UR57571949", "Content": "This is our second stay at this hotel and it will be our hotel of choice for future visits to Madrid.", "Date": "March 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY", "Title": "\u201cgreat location, great value\u201d", "Author": "NyMellie", "ReviewID": "UR56984061", "Content": "Hotel regina is in a perfect location.

Me and my Mother travelled to Madrid for some sightseeing and managed to get a great deal on the hotel. Good Points... The city of Madrid is beautiful and the Hotels location is just brilliant, it has some brilliant restaurants and cafe's in the immediate vicinity, with a starbucks almost next door. The Plaza de la Puerto del sol is close by with everything you need, many souvenier shops even a Mcdonalds and Burger King! The hotel is within walking distance of pretty much all the attractions including the Museo del Prado, Palacio Real and famous Plaza Mayor which I highly recommend visiting. So if you are after somewhere where you can reach everything easily, pick the hotel regina! I completely recommend the hotel's restaurant and cafe for food and drink. The staff are very welcoming and we had a top class 3 course meal in the restaurant. We found both pretty pricey however nothing too outragous. The hotel itself is beautifully decorated to a high standard for a 3*, it was kept clean and had a nice vibe. We had a standard non smoking room and it was tastefully decorated and plenty big enough. The bathroom was lovely and the whole room was very clean. Staff at the hotel spoke perfect English and were very helpful allowing us to keep room on until evening and ordering us a taxi to the airport. Unlike some hotels i've stayed in beds were very comfortable. Bad Points... The only big problem we had was the noise. Our room was in the middle of the hotel at the top of a stairwell and although we couldn't hear any traffic from the front, we could hear everything else!! Other people have commented on the noise and the rooms certainly aren't soundproof. We could hear every word of everyones conversations both in the coridoors and in the neighbouring rooms! As we were only there 3 nights it didnt bother us too much but if you are staying longer definitely taking a pair of earplugs! Also don't even attempt a lie in, the housekeeping starts promptly at 7.30 am with the hoovering of the coridoors and sometimes doesn't finish til the evening! *If your travelling within the next few weeks be aware that when we stayed there was some minor redecoration going on which added to the noise level, nothing too drastic though. Everything is pretty expensive but then again it is anywhere the euro is to be honest, just make sure you choose wisely. The only other complaint we had was that our room looked out on the airconditioning shaft, not attractive! A small problem though. For us non-smoking Brits who have got used to the smoking ban, beware the cafe is the designated smoking area. I have no problem with people smoking inside at all, just not whilst I'm eating, it wasn't very pleasant. To be honest though these bad points are all minor and the good far outweigh the bad. Top Tips Definitely invest in a phrase book as we found many of the people spoke little or no English which can be a problem when ordering things. You can get by on the basic 'gracias' and 'por favor' but it's nice to make the effort. Remember your European adapter, we forgot ours which was a big problem. Luckily there is a huge department store in the Plaza de la Puerto del sol a bit like Debenhams which sells everything! If your sightseeing start your break with a tour on the open top bus it's a great way to see everything the bus stops are located outside hotel and you but tickets from the magazine stalls for 17euros. Always look at outdoor menus before you go in restaurants/cafes to gage prices. You dont want to get caught out paying 40 odd euros a head! Taxis from airport to hotel regina should be no dearer than 30euros, so dont be conned. Try to buy your euros before you go, because the rate seemed to be worse, I wouldnt recommend changing money in the hotel. If your room only, I recommend venturing to the plaza to buy some bottles of water and maybe snacks just in case you get thirsty or peckish and don't want to pay the pricy room service. Finally if your looking for great traditional spanish souveniers we found a gem of a shop on the right about 3/4 of the way down the Calle Mayor in the direction of the Palace. It sold beautiful things and was very reasonably priced. You have to see... Palacio Real - Madrid's Palace Cathedral Almudena - stunning stain glass windows which is located next to the palace Plaza Mayor - Lovely cafes and souveneir shops Botanical Gardens - But not in the winter. Museo del Prado - Amazing art gallery (free on Sunday afternoons) Plaza del puerto del sol - Fantatstic area of shops, tapas restaurants, bars. I would definitely recommend this hotel it is a perfect base for a sightseeing holiday, we had a great stay at the Regina and would go again to the beautiful city of Madrid.", "Date": "January 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh", "Title": "\u201cGood value for price - excellent location\u201d", "Author": "Learmonth09", "ReviewID": "UR51453526", "Content": "Right by the Sevilla metro station and near the main square.

The only real trouble we had was upon checking out, when we were handed a 120 euro bill for 4 breakfasts (2 people), even though the person checking us in had explicitly said that breakfast was included. I honestly couldn't remember whether it was supposed to be included, so I said \"it is included?\" and he confirmed that yes it was. We were happy about this, of course, as the breakfast was a good hot/cold buffet right downstairs. But then the check-out guy said that rooms booked on hotels.com or expedia never come with breakfast, but how were we supposed to know that? We insisted that we were told it was included, and gave them that there's-no-way-in-hell-we're-going-to-pay-this-bill face, and his colleague nudged him and he relented.

The hotel itself is OK - clean, simple and in a great location. Our rooms were all OK without being special, but the main selling point is the location bang in the centre of Madrid, within easy walking distance of all the major sites, galleries, parks and squares. The Regina is right opposite the Sevilla Metro staion, so access is easy, and it's about a 2-minute walk from Sol. Some tips: - On arrival at the airport, buy the combined Bus/Metro pass which is valid from the airport and all around town. The transport network is superb - they've pumped millions into it recently - and the ticket is really cheap. 11 Euros for three days unlimited is teriffic value - Check out the 'Museum of Ham' just by the Place Major. It's a bit wacky and you can drink there until about 2am. Our group were there drinking until the close, and the total bill for 15 guys drinking heavily all night was 60 Euros. We legged it before they realised their mistake. - Beware that there are pickpockets and thieves everywhere - espcially around the Sol area. I had my phone stolen at 4am, but realised and got it back from the bloke after I threatened him. He then gleefully showd me his collection of phones he'd stolen that night! Be very careful if anyone comes over to you like an old friend, shakes hands and pats you on the back. You may just find that your phone / wallet has just gone.

I have checked the price for the hotel alone on Expedia.ca and it was going for $250 a night for the week that we stayed there (July 29-August 5). If I ever go back to Madrid, it has to be to this hotel! I have travelled all throughout Europe, and the room at the Regina was the average European-sized room, smaller than our North American rooms, but I didn't feel cramped. But thank goodness it was summer and the windows were closed because we did not have a pretty view from the window (we were on the fifth floor). The a/c in the room was not as cold as we would have liked it but we slept fine until the last night when the a/c broke. But I think this had something to do with the intense heat in the city and the constant use of the a/'c throughout the hotel and city! Our safe was programmed to lock and unlock with the swipe of one of our credit cards which I thought was a fantastic idea. They asked us for a credit card at check in and we had no idea why so we were a little worried, but the porter who brought our luggages to the room explained that the credit card would lock and unlock the safe! Brillant! Breakfast was better than I have had in other European hotels, there was porridge, eggs, sausage, croissants, doughnuts, cereals, cold cuts, cheese, bread, fruit salad, sliced fruit, pudding, yoghurt, Spanish tortilla (potato and egg omlette- yum!) a coffee machine, and a juice machine. This was a real money saver for us, as we didn't really need to eat lunch with such a big breakfast! We are not picky eaters so there was more than enough to satisify us! The first few days the cleaning lady forgot to give us our towels, one night we called front desk, the other time we caught up with her in the hallways, and from that point on, we never had to ask. She did a great job cleaning the room, we would walk back in and smell the lemon cleaner! I think they clean first and replenish towels later, so they either forget or we returned too early! What really impressed me about this hotel is how clean it was. Madrid in general is a clean city, but they had cleaning staff working at 10:30 night, washing the lobby walls! Incredible! Another thing I enjoyed was its close proximity to the metro and to Puerta del Sol. We would walk down there every night, the hotel is a 10 minute walk to great shopping, and food. If you don't always feel like eating out, you can visit the El Cortes Ingles supermarket (the entrance is just off Via Precioso) and pick up some munchies. Also, El Museo fel Jamon (not a museum but a deli) offers 'picnics to go', a ham sandwhich, a drink (pop or beer), and a fruit for 2 euros, and this is close to the hotel. Because in general, I found eating out in Madrid to be much pricier than expected. Madrid is a fantastic city, I really enjoyed myself there, but it was HOT!!!! Avoid visiting in the summer, but if you are a teacher like me and have no other choice, good luck! We quickly fell into the typical Madrileno pattern of eating a late lunch (when we did eat lunch) around 2, napping, and then eating a late dinner. The sun did not set until around 9:30 at night, and it cooled down to about 30 degrees celsius at night., so pack accordingly. Some highlights in Madrid: -the hop on hop off tour has two great lines! -the Prado (international teachers get in free!) -the Thyssen and Reina Sofia are much smaller than the Prado but have some really cool pieces -Retiro Park- awesome! -Royal Palace -he Cathedral of Madrid- make sure you climb to the roof top for a great view of the city -cable car trip from West Park to Casa do Campo -Egyptian temple in West Park -SHOPPING- Madrid is a fantastic place to shop- we found that every place accepted credit cards but they need photo id, so make sure you have it with you. And if you can, take a bus from the Padre Pio station to Segovia for a chance to see Roman aqueducts in fantastic shape and the Alcazar fortress where the Catholic 'King' Isabella was crowned Queen of Spain!

The breakfast was plentiful but we thought it was boring and poor quality and we had to ask for towels and toilet paper as we were left without either! Our main concern was security. The hotel has this crazy system of the door swipe card also being the swipe card to lock and unlock the safe, so it seemed likely that cleaning staff would also have access to the room safe. We couldn't get ours to work anyway and having read reports of theft at the hotel decided we wouldn't leave anything of value in the room at all. I had my purse stolen from my bag on our last night. It was deftly removed as we crossed the Plaza Saint Ana. Lost a lot of cash, my metro ticket and two credit cards. The hotel staff were helpful but how I wish the security in the hotel had been better! Due to the heat and the theft, we basically had a lousy time in Madrid and couldn't wait to get on the plane and head for home. Shame really, as I had booked it to celebrate my husband's 60th b'day.

In April 2007, I reserved three rooms through the hotel\u2019s website, for three nights for twelve persons beginning June 16, 2007. The hotel website facilities are provided by Central Reservations Limited (CentralR.Com). Upon checking in the early morning of June 16, 2007, we were told by front desk staff, unequivocally, that breakfast was free, i.e. included in the room price. Most of us ate breakfast for two mornings. Upon checking out, we noticed that breakfast charges of 12 euros for each breakfast, had been added to our bill. I questioned the breakfast charges, and was told by front desk staff, that breakfast was an additional fee. I indicated that hotel front desk staff had informed us at check-in that breakfast was free. Front desk staff told me that individual was not available to confirm what I was saying. Front desk staff then told me breakfast charges were additional because the online booking form did not indicate that breakfast was included in the room fee, huh? I responded that there was no reference to breakfast charges at all in the online booking process, thus the online booking form was not any substantiation for the hotel\u2019s basis for charging the breakfasts. Hotel staff refused to remove the charges. Upon returning home, I contacted the hotel about the matter. I further explained that I had saved copies of every web page of the on-line booking to justify what I was saying. Again Hotel Regina staff refused to reimburse the inappropriate breakfast charges. I also contacted CentralR.Com about the matter. CentralR.Com sent a form communication stating \u201c\u2026we will endeavour to reply to your request as soon as possible\u201d. As of this writing, I have not received another response from CentralR.com. No indication was made on the booking forms and subsequent confirmations that taxes and surcharges would be charged in addition to the room rate. Yet upon checkout we were charged an \u201cI.V.A.\u201d tax of 7% on the room rate, breakfast charges, and other charges. I have traveled extensively over the past thirty years and have stayed at literally hundreds of hotels of all sizes and class. I can unequivocally state that the Hotel Regina Madrid, except as previously noted, had the most impolite and inhospitable staff I have ever experienced in a hotel environment.

I suppose that the rooms on the front street must be very noisy because of the traffic at any time, maybe they are bigger and better. The bedcloth was broken and the hairdrier was half-broken. The worst thing was the noise in the morning: I didn't need my alarm clock because I was awaken every day by the continuous banging of doors, not to mention the chambermaids who shouted from a room to another. I was happy to sleep at home when I came back! To sum up, there is a big gap between the common parts of the hotels, which are nice, and the rooms I have seen, very old fashioned and which overviewed terrible inner courtyards (from the courtyards came also smell of food from some kitchen, fortunately it was cold and I rarely opened the windows). If I went to Madrid again, I'd spend a little more money but I'd chose another hotel.", "Date": "March 31, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kensington, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cLocation, Location, Location\u201d", "Author": "rlbrowdy", "ReviewID": "UR3252889", "Content": "This place is right on the main drag, so it is easy to find if you are driving. It doesn't have a garage, but the entrance to a public parking lot is directly in front of the hotel. We stayed one night. Never used the metro directly in front of the hotel because everything we wanted to see was walking distance, including a fun flamenco show nearby (with geriatric dancers).

It was the best I could do to refine my choices. Well, I am grateful to everyone who wrote well of it. It is a central as any hotel can be. It is very clean, lots of marble, perfect bathrooms with reliable hot water. Cheerful and helpful people run the hotel. There is a big restaurant which serves an excellent expansive breakfast. I didn't eat there in the evening so I cant vouch for that. There also a very agreeable bar which lets onto both the hotel and the street and which serves amongst the usual drinks a variety of tapas. Very nice after a hard days plodding around to be able to relax with a drink in the bar. All in all, this is an excellent hotel where they have made an effort to be visually entertaining with small but differently styled lounges on each floor and various arrangements of objects a la Gaudi/Miro/Picasso/Dali (might not be to your taste...but friendly and thoughtful). It is also very quiet. Most of the rooms are not at the front and the fact that there is no view is well disguised. I didn't mind that at all but some might. They also have free safe's in every room which we found a little eccentric to use but in the end worked well. I feel I owe them this review. Feel safe to book there!
