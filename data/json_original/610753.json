{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Perfect for landing or taking off from Mexico City Just a day before leaving Mexico, the Quality Inn turned out to be the perfect hotel for a bit of pre-flight relaxing and organizing. The place doesn't look spectacular or 'authentic', but is very comfortable and well-located. We stayed on the sixth floor, at the back of the hotel, which provided a nice view and a quiet night's sleep. The room was clean and very spacious, outfitted with a large and comfortable bed, a coffee maker and a docking station for your iPod. Much more than you'd expect for the 920 pesos we paid (we accidentally got some sort of special rate). The girl at the reception desk was very friendly, and helped us out with directions. The taxi we ordered to head to the airport was fair-priced and fast. Roma, the area, is a lovely and relaxed base to explore Mexico City from, and the street is not too busy, but certainly lively. Good restaurants, nice cafes and some cool shops line the Alvaro Obregon and surrounding streets.", "Date": "Nov 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR356488402", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "sasster"}, {"Content": "Staff is very helpful and friendly and the room is very nice After the long flight from Europe it was nice to be back in Mexico City knowing that this nice, clean hotel was waiting. We love the neighborhood with all the restaurants (Bisquets Bisquets and Bistro61 accross the street are good and cheap places), the weekend art market and the regular market about 5 minutes away on Sundays. We stayed for 4 nights and made a reservation for the last 2 nights of our trip. Unfortunately our flight was cancelled and we had to stay 4 nights longer. Although the hotel was fully booked for the last 2 nights the manager was so nice to let us stay. Staff is very friendly and there is always a person around who speaks English. The first nights we had room 203 and the last nights 104. We prefer the first one, the last one has a door going to room 103, of course it was looked but it lets more sounds in from the neighbors.", "Date": "May 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR110709481", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "hetden"}, {"Content": "Nice for Night Stopover       Mexico City view from Chapultepec Park", "Date": "Mar 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR731395173", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Snowbirds2"}, {"Content": "Great Hotel - Great Value We stayed three nights at this between Christmas and New Years. The Hotel far exceeded our expectations for the price. It is a very modern business hotel and everything is new and clean, the beds were very firm and provided a great night's sleep. Based on previous reviews I was concerned about street noise as our room was also on a lower floor and faced the street. However, it quieted down early in the evening and didn't start up again till a decent hour in the morning - very quiet on the weekend. We were happy with the neighborhood, comfortable walking at night and plenty of restaurants in the area. We ate twice at Taqueria Fronterra, just across the street. The food was good and reasonably priced, great when you are too tired to go far for dinner after a full day of sightseeingr. This hotel is a bit of a walk to the subway but we enjoy walking so it was not a problem. If you aren't big walkers and don't want to pay for taxis then I wouldn't recommend this location. As for taxis - the staff ordered a car for our trip back to the airport and it was only $140 ($12.50). The driver was on time, polite, and the car very clean - couldn't ask for more. I really liked having an ice machine, breakfast was not exciting but adequate (cereal, pastries and fruit) and the roof top solarium was a nice place to enjoy a cold beer (picked up at the OXXO around the corner) and stretch out on the chaises in the late afternoon. All in all we enjoyed are stay and I would not hesitate to stay here again and would recommend it to others.", "Date": "Jan 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR548859755", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "sweetatlgirl"}, {"Content": "Not for light sleepers I specifically asked for a quiet room upon booking and again at check-in, and was told that all rooms were the same in that regard. If so, this is not a place for people who need quiet in order to sleep. The hotel is right on a very busy avenue that has a fair amount of traffic even in the middle of the night. Closing both sets of drapes helped, but the noise from cars and motorcycles never stopped. Moreover, I could hear flushing water, mechanical noises (sounded like the elevator going up and down), and even someone's phone call at 4:45 AM. Assuming you can sleep through all of this, the hotel is in a great location, the staff is helpful and friendly, and my room was very spacious and wired for internet access.", "Date": "Dec 19, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR880848446", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "mrsirin"}, {"Content": "Great location,wonderful rooms  This hotel was highly recommended by a Poblano. The hotel is nicely situated between the business district and the two major tourist districts of Mexico city, La Zona Rosa and La Condesa. It was very safe and secured and a quick metro ride to El Zocalo. Since this hotel is brand new, you can expect a shiny, big entry and very modern, ample rooms. Most of the staff speaks english and is very accommodating. I can't wait to go back once the pool is completed! The only thing I'd be more aware of next time is the ridiculously high taxi prices running from that particular hotel. the staff will call a taxi for you, but they'll choose the company and usually there's a really expensive set fee. It's better to go out in front of the hotel or walk down to the major intersection and catch a white taxi with a red stripe that reads 'Mexico City.' Make sure you walk a few doors up (North) from the hotel to a little restaurant called El Patiecito De La Roma. ( right past Bisquets Bisquets) It's absolutely delightful and so very tasty!", "Date": "Sep 7, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR602515365", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "IzzyJR3"}, {"Content": "Room was too close to street level - too noisy We booked the hotel after reading all the raving reviews on Tripadvisor but unfortunately, it must be have been the one room that we were assigned to, Room 106.It was our last night in DF so it didn't quite matter and we had to catch our flight at 7am in any case so we literally used it just for 7 hours of sleeping. The room was right above the driveway of the hotel and directly facing the street level on the first floor. It was loud, noisy and we constantly hear street noise including alarms and police sirens, etc, well, it's a big city so can't avoid that but certainly wished we had a room in the back of the bldg or in another corner.

There is free internet (with a cable, available from the desk) in the room and wireless in the lobby. They booked a great tour to Teotihuacan (picked up at the hotel) for us one day. The hotel is close to the airport (15 minutes), less than 10 minute walk to the Metro (which we took, for 2 pesos, to Frida Kahlo's house - now a museum), and along an avenue with a super restaurant (Casa Lamm) and several fine ones. Free coffee in the lobby all day.The included breakfast was just OK, but you can order eggs and other things.

We were two couples retirred and fit and we dont mind walking and exploring cities. This hotel is well situated in a safe area, we walked the streets around the hotel when we went out to eat at nights and felt very safe, in fact we found Mexico City one of the safest cities we have been too.Of course you need to take the usual precautions. Travelling about the city is so easy. The hotel is 10 Mins walk away from an undergroud station and the system is superp, cheap, clean and very frequent though most times a bit crowded. The Red and White taxis are the best to take and there are always plenty to hail and they are very cheap even late at night. The hotel is modern but the rooms are excellent and the facilities good,all you could wish for. A great bonus is the free internet. The staff were very helpful and spoke English and we were able to leave some luggage there for safe keeping while we went on our trip. We only had brealfast at the hotel which was simple but very good and quite adequate. The place is spotless and the beds large and comfortable and for one who cant cope with hard hotel matrasses it was an added bonus.

We stayed at Mexico City for about five days in october, the slow season for the tourism industry. The hotel is new, and most of the time, there is someone who speaks English, if not the person tries very hard to help us out. The service is great! With the price, they even provide a breakfest buffet every morning. Every weekend (I think is Saturday) there is a Artist Market right in front of the hotel. It is very cute. Also there is local eateries near by that open quite late. Thre is a coffee house/restaurant near by (diaganol across the big avenue, sorry we forgot the name) has band/beat poet/show almost everynight. We get around by subway most of the time, and there is two stop within 7 blocks. We are bargain travelers that still would like comfort.

Well, what we found was a 4-maybe 5 star hotel. When my wife walked in the room, her first words were \u9225\u6e19h, wow, this is nice!\u9225? As the husband who had chosen this place, I felt a huge relief that she liked it. Sometimes being thrifty has backfired on me. The Room: The rooms are very modern. They have marble, natural oak with stainless steel accents, and a vaulted ceiling, along with a balcony that looks out to the city and its mountains. There is indirect lighting embedded in the walls and in the vaulted ceiling that gives the room a very upscale look at night. The safe in the room can use a PIN number or a credit card swipe for those like me who forget codes all of the time. The Hotel: It is within walking distance to downtown, the trendy zona rosa (Mexican Beverly Hills) and across a boulevard where artists sell their creations on weekends. This hotel is very quiet and private. You seldom have to share your elevator with others, there are no crowds of people in the lobby making a commotion, and if you drive, the valet parking is indoors, free, and no one is allowed in the parking garage but the security staff. This in itself is huge. We were paying 60 pesos for public parking a day at another hotel in Acapulco. The rooms are built around the building\u9225\u6a9a perimeter, so the lobby\u9225\u6a9a ceiling extends all the way to the roof of the building. As you look up, it looks like you are looking into an Aztec pyramid with all of its different levels. They also have free Internet and a business center that everyone can use with new computers, fax machines, copiers, and LAN printers. My kids enjoyed the use of the computers while we watched TV upstairs in the room. Most other places charge you to use their computers by the hour. The Staff: Very professional and helpful. They always had a place to suggest when we asked about the best places to eat and have fun at a low cost. My Experience: We stayed in different parts in mexico during our two weeks\u9225?vacation, and this was by far the best place we stayed at. The $160.00 a night hotel we stayed in Acapulco is a one star place compared to this hotel. I also travel frequently for my employer and I can safely say that this hotel is among one of the best I have stayed at. Hotels in Mexico are not what we are used to in the US, so finding this hotel with this quality of service and services in Mexico was like finding a treasure.", "Date": "Aug 14, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR694281983", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Fernand0"}, {"Content": "Gutes Preis-/Leistungsverh\u76f2ltnis   showReview(11412438, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 10, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR356284933", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Excelente hotel por el precio!   showReview(7246648, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 29, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR561233734", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "FernandezMonterrey"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d610753-r22275951-Quality_Inn_Ciudad_de_Mexico_Roma-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "HotelID": "610753", "Price": "$103"}}
