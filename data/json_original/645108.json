{"Reviews": [{"Content": "No Dice Folks ... Well, to be completely honest, I don\u9225\u6a9b know where to begin. I literally burst out laughing when I realized The Orange Tulip had landed itself on tripadvisor.com. I want to start this review by saying that I am not a difficult lady to please. Let\u9225\u6a9a start at the beginning!!I wound up staying at the Orange Tulp, not the Orange Tulip, as the \u9225\u6dda\u9225?was not evident in the sign. The first thing I noticed was the bags, upon bags, of garbage that graced the front door of the hotel. I felt a little worried at that point, but I figured its Amsterdam, and it\u9225\u6a9a not that big of a deal. I had seen photos of the hotel, so I felt okay walking into the situation. There is a ridiculous amount of stairs. Very narrow stairs. I had trouble maneuvering up them, and I\u9225\u6a93 a small girl. There is a lot of stairs. We counted and the total number of narrow stairs to our \u9225\u6e09otel room\u9225?was 87. Yip, 87 stairs, after exploring a city all day is rough. Check in was easy. The staff was friendly enough. But, I only stayed one day, and that was our only interaction with the staff, so I can\u9225\u6a9b really speak on how great or lack there of, they are.So, 87 narrow stairs later, we get to our \u9225\u6e09otel room\u9225? I use quotes every time I write \u9225\u6e09otel room\u9225?because; it was far from a hotel room. It was a disgusting square of walls that magically contained 4 beds. It was small. Really small!! There was also absolutely no view. I\u9225\u6a93 not kidding when I say there was MOULD on the walls, on the baseboards. There was no washroom in the room, only a communal washroom down the hall. (Actually downstairs, and down the hall, as that once we unlocked the door to the room, there was another flight of stairs that brought us to the attic). The washroom was the most disgusting, vile room I\u9225\u6a9de ever seen in my life. I backpacked through Europe, and stayed in hostels, and a couple great hotels, and a couple AWFUL hotels. This one, by far, took the cake. This is a list of the things that were included in the shower room: mould, dirty boxers, hair all over the floor, and hair ties, and whatnot. The water was cold. It smelled like it hadn\u9225\u6a9b been washed in about a month. The toilet room was worse. It smelled worse, had slightly more mould, and actually made me sick to my stomach. This was a year and a half ago, and every now and then the girls and I will still burst out laughing about this \u9225\u6e09otel room\u9225? The bed sheets did look brand new, but the beds were really uncomfortable. If I can give you one piece of advice, book elsewhere. It\u9225\u6a9a not even that cheap, we paid like 50 bucks Canadian each for one night \u9225?so 200.00 Canadian for the room a night \u9225?honestly, you can do better.We were worried the entire time about getting toxic mould from our \u9225\u6e09otel room\u9225? And, that is something that you should never worry about.", "Date": "Nov 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR999084857", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Siobhan1983"}, {"Content": "saver to stay outside stairs were black with dirt , landing tiles with holes,smell of peerooms were small, dirty .and the curtins not on the rails there was no safe will never be BACK", "Date": "Oct 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR675721170", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "fatboy2000"}, {"Content": "The worst hotel I have ever seen in my whole life A hotel to avoid at all cost!!! When you arrive at the hotel, you are greeted with filthy stairs leading up to a less than welcoming reception. The corridors smelt of urine. When we finally saw the room, we immediately concluded we could not stay a minute longer in that hotel. The bed was disgusting, cockroaches were crawling on the floor and the bathroom looked unhygienic. The receptionist was sympathetic but said he could not issue a refund. He said they were getting complaints all the time but the owner was not doing anything about it. We asked if it was worth speaking to the manager but he said it wouldn't get us our money back.

The Orange Tulip was a huge disappointment. I booked a room there because the location seemed great, and the hotel's website promised a cozy room at a really good price. I was looking for something simple, clean and affordable. What I found was more like a prison room that hadn't been cleaned for a while, with a very questionable bed spread and a shower head over the toilet. When I complained, the receptionist told me this was my only option. There was no way I would stay in that room - not just because it was awful, but also because it was very much not the room they promised. After the receptionist refused to refund my deposit, I talked to the manager on the phone and tried to explain what happened. He was much less polite than the receptionist. I've never experienced such rude service. In the end, I left.

Terrible location (nothing nice about the Damrack!) dirty  noisy. I requested a room change when they assigned me one of the noisy threadbare rooms facing the street, and I paid dearly for it. In the end it wasn't even cheap. I also found a dead slug on my bedspread (no joke) and threw the bedspread on the floor, and everyday it was put back on the bed, complete with slug.The bathroom was clean, the sheets were cleanish - but I found the carpet, furniture, and blankets filthy, as were the stairs...Also very noisy with people coming any going all night.

Just back from 3 nights in amsterdam. I suppose the best thing to say about this hotel is you get what you pay for. The stairs are very steep and hard to manouvre but upon check in and check out someone carried our bags for us. The staff at reception were fairly friendly and helpful. The restaurant downstairs is the main drawback, the staff are very rude and on the 2 mornings that we got breakfast there we were charged extra even though breakfast was supposed to be included in the price of the hotel. They didnt tell us this at the time it was only when we were leaving the hotel that the staff on reception presented us with the bill, we felt like criminals!
