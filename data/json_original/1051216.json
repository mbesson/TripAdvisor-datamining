Ignoring the sophomoric pun, I enjoyed this hotel very much. It's bare bones. No public spaces to speak of, except the breakfast room. The rooms are on the 2nd and 3rd floors of an old building that houses another hotel, or more. But, the design is thoroughly modern and was a nice break from the other \"standard\" hotels in which I stayed in Italy. My room faced the small street, but with electric shutters, the room was both quiet and dark. As with another Rome hotel in the same area that I just reviewed, the location is nowhere land. Close to the train station, but quite far from all the major tourist attractions. This may well be an advantage to some travelers. Unexceptional breakfast (3/5).

We almost walked right by the hotel as there isn't a sign for it other than a nameplate on a door buzzer, we were lucky to have stopped and checked the map at the right moment. Upon check in the lady at the desk was very helpful and attentive. She showed us to our room (which was right across from the reception desk, more on that in a minute), and immediately gave us a water boiler for our baby and a hair dryer. We notified the hotel that we would need a baby cot for our 11 month old daughter and it was set up and ready for use the minute we got there. The rooms are decorated in a minimalist fashion which worked for the ambiance of the hotel. Our room was good sized, comfortable and clean, as was the bathroom. The location of the hotel was perfect because we were able to get around quite easily. We walked to the Colosseum and the Spanish Steps, plus a metro station was very close. The hotel is on a quiet street close to a main drag but there wasn't too much street noise which was nice. The morning breakfast was great, I absolutely loved the croissants. The staff was friendly and everyone that we encountered spoke English which was helpful since this was our first stop on our vacation. A gentleman at the desk recommended a good restaurant that many locals go to within walking distance. It was quite delicious! My only complaint is that it was quite easy to hear everything that went on in the reception area in our room, H. I'm sure that was because of the hardwood floors, everything echoes off of them anyway.

The good news is the property is very quite given the fact that you are in a busy urban area. The room was modern, minimalist with a comfortable bed and nice bathroom. My wife joined me a couple days later and we did quite a bit of shopping as Saldi was going on everywhere. The room was large enough to handle all of our swag and remain comfortable. Wifi worked well. Getting around was easy as several sites are within walking distance, buses and metro are also within one block. The breakfast was very simple and since I was in Italy I preferred to find more interesting food elsewhere. A fantastic restaurant for lunch and dinner called Target is right downstairs. We would stay here again without hesitation.", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAn excellent option for staying in Rome\u201d", "Author": "dino c", "ReviewID": "UR121635046", "Content": "If you are looking for a centric hotel in Rome we highly recommend suite dreams.

Very helpful since it was our first time in Rome and we didn't know what to expect in terms of street layouts and traffic. I also emailed the hotel to ask them how to get to their location from Termini and another option is to take the metro (line A) to Repubblica station, which is about 2-3 blocks away from the hotel. We opted to walk from Termini to the hotel, which wasn't an unpleasant experience at all. The hotel is in quiet street, with reception and most of its rooms on the 1st floor (2nd floor for us Americans) of an old building. The lift is small and very old so it can only accommodate a certain number of bags and people. We only used the lift twice - once when we checked in with our bags and the other when we checked out, bringing down our luggage. The hotel staff are very warm and welcoming. They immediately showed us a map to let us know where we were and our proximity to different must-see attractions. We were also asked if we needed wireless Internet connection and immediately gave us the network and password info. We were then taken to our rooms and shown how to work the a/c, etc. Very nice gesture. The rooms are quiet spacious for European standards. The bed was comfortable but we like firm beds so it might not be to your liking if you're into soft mattresses. We loved the modern, minimalist, and Zen-like feel of the room and its bathroom. I especially like the bathroom floor tiles that looked like hardwood but were in fact tiles. The rooms don't come with flat irons and ironing boards but it was easy enough to remedy. We just asked the staff and they came promptly with a flat iron and board for us to use. Breakfast came with our rate since we booked through the website. While continental, it was still filling enough. There was a choice of meats, cheeses, yogurt, cereals, toast, biscuits, and cakes. There were hard-boiled eggs too. The espresso machine was pretty nifty and easy to use. On our first night in Rome, the hotel staff recommended various places for dinner. We wanted really good pasta and they recommended a few places, to the extent of even calling the restaurants to make sure they were open from their summer holiday. The restaurant they recommended, Ristoranti Il GiardiRoma, had such good pasta!!! We had no problems at all with this hotel.

He didn\u2019t seem to check my name, just started flicking through a folder of printed out emails, and asked me at one point if I was someone with a completely different surname. My mind was now entertaining the idea of having to find another hotel if this one was full, which is never a nice type of thought to have when you are hot and tired and just want to check-in. I printed my name and asked him please to look at it, but he didn\u2019t seem very interested and barely glanced so I wasn't sure he'd really read it \u2013 he just wouldn\u2019t engage - it was as though if he made eye contact or acknowledged anything I said, it might create some kind of moral contract and he\u2019d have to accept that I indeed just might have booked a room. Anyway, after a rather tense wait of several minutes, flicking through his folder, he found the relevant email. Breakfast, he explained, would be 15 Euros because I\u2019d not booked through their website (I\u2019d just clicked on \u201cbook\u201d in tripadvisor and it had taken me to venere.com). After I explained that their email of six weeks earlier had said 10 Euros, he said they would honour that, but they had needed to raise their prices since then. At this point he became noticeably more helpful in his attitude, I think because he\u2019d now accepted that I was indeed a guest and not just some stranger who\u2019d wandered in off the street. He showed me the room (how many hotels do that?) and explained the main features, including showing me how to use the air conditioning, and even showed me how to use the tv remote control \u2013 very attentive and helpful. He encouraged me to just ask if I had any requests at all. The room, described as the \u201cWhite Room\u201d was sombre, I\u2019d call it the \u201cGrey Room\u201d personally. There is no decoration at all, not even a small modern picture, which I suppose is nice if you like ultra-minimalism but I found it a bit lacking in personality and finish. I would encourage them to put a painting or print above the tv. Huge heavy net curtains provide privacy from the apartments and offices across the road, but also block daylight out, which meant the room felt permanently gloomy. But in all other respects it is a splendid room, extremely clean, well furnished, with a nice highly polished wood-block floor. Air conditioning was highly efficient, easy to use, with a useful quiet setting for night. The tv had clear menus and good reception, including BBC world service, which I like. Bed was very firm, just as I like it, and I had a very good nights sleep (which is ultimately what you want from a hotel!). Window seems to keep the noise out (it's on a quiet road anyway) and, unusually for a hotel with air conditioning, you can open the window, which is a nice feature. Breakfast was okay but a bit disappointing. I think that is one area where I hope some constructive criticism may help. Coffee is self-served by a nespresso machine, which to be honest I find a bit fiddly and annoying. I\u2019d prefer my coffee to be made for me and served in a cup or jug, or a machine that just makes black filter coffee (or Americano, as Europeans call it). Also, there were no bread rolls, only some rather mean looking bits of sliced bread for the toaster (which, as is the way with those machines, doesn\u2019t really toast, it barely browns it even after two \u201cgo\u2019s\u201d through the machine). So, as a vegetarian, I\u2019d have quite liked some cheese, but would have wanted a bread roll to put it on. I saw meat eaters with piles of meat on their plates, and wondered if any of them might also have liked a bread roll to go with it? Yogurt wasn't very nice. Anyway, I think those are things they can work on. Overall I suppose the breakfast is fair value because there was plenty of food and a good range. No smoke detector that I could see in my room, so not sure what the fire detection systems are. The building is shared with other users, including another hotel, so hopefully there are always people around at night who can detect smoke. The reception is constantly staffed apparently. Two small bottles of free water a day (in the fridge, perfect for if you arrive on a hot day) and minibar prices are reasonable. Check-out was swift and easy, the guy had marked my breakfast as 10 instead of 15 Euros, which I appreciated, as I\u2019d suspected I\u2019d have to explain it all again \u2013 I agree with other reviewers that the staff, all English speaking, are all good, and go out of their way to look after you. As others have pointed out, the location is excellent, and there are shops nearby where you can buy more water and things. Despite the booking mix-up and rather tense first few minutes there (first impressions....) I still think this place deserved five rather than four starts, and I'd certainly consider staying again on my next trip to Rome.", "Date": "August 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Corning, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, Great Staff and beautiful rooms close to Roma Termini.\u201d", "Author": "joconnel", "ReviewID": "UR116234798", "Content": "Our stay at SuiteDreams was wonderful.

My wife caught a cold from this. The default setting should be pointing toward the ceiling to avoid this problem or the AC units could be placed on the wall where your head is and have the air vents go out into the room over you. I am not sure if the AC units are attached to an air duct system. I don't think they are. The units are very quiet and have a remote control on them, but the placement and default vent position is bad at least for our room. The hotel owner should assume that people will come into the hotel and have jet lag or be very tired and won't have time or ability to adjust something that should be correctly adjusted to begin with. The other very minor concern is the hand held shower receptacle was loose and so when the hand held shower nozzle was place in it, IT would frequently end up spraying on you or going out of control somehow and getting the bathroom floor all wet.", "Date": "July 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chia-yi, Taiwan", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, we have sweet dreams here.\u201d", "Author": "Sonia_Shen", "ReviewID": "UR115944860", "Content": "It was our last night in Italy.

First off, it is really close to the Republica Metro station, and also close to Termini station if you are planning on taking a train in or out of Rome. We easily walked from the Termini station to the hotel, with a map in hand. A lot of reviews said this place was hard to find, so we kept this in mind when we were wondering the street of Modena. But it was fairly easy to find. So location, in terms of using this as a connector to jump on the Metro was great. It was also not that far of a walk from the Colliseum. We actually walked everywhere (Trevi Fountation, Spanish Steps, Piazza Navona) except the Vatican and the area around the Pyramide stop. It probably took half an hour to the Piazza Navona, which was the farthest walk. The establishment itself is very modern and chic. I loved it. The black out blinds were key to a peaceful night's sleep. In addition, the breakfast was fully stocked with great foods ranging from pastries to fruit. The espresso machine was awesome- and we used it during the day as well. Also, they provide two free bottles of water/day. The staff were very friendly and set up our car ride to the airport. They also printed out any documents that we needed from our laptop as we did not have access to a printer. If you stay here, I would recommend eating the the Target Restaurant.

It is a very difficult and delicate skills to make your quest feels at home, this is something that a large chain can't do. When we first check in, the briefing and explaination of how things moves & works in Rome was very useful even though we have been to Rome before. The location at first glance isnt that attractive as it is not in the tourist belt but for someone who has been to all the tourist spots, this location is very convenient as the tube station is only 5 minutes walk. We do not feel threatened or unsafe when we walk around the hotel, perhaps it is because it is away from the tourist spots. The rocket restaurant on the ground floor is fantastic.

I switched to this hotel after a horrible night at the Forum Hotel. I'm all for the old architecture of the eternal city, but I'd rather have clean modern amenities for my hotel - which is surprisingly difficult to find in Rome. Most affordable hotels in the city have a very dated/antique style with claustrophobic rooms that remind me more of moth balls or haunted mansions. And a pet peeve of mine throughout most of the hotels in Italy is the shoddy wifi. Suitedreams solves all these problems. The room is huge compared to other hotels in Rome for the same price. I even have enough space to do yoga in my room! The decor is contemporary, but still comfortable. It's easy to control the air conditioning and heat, there is a minibar with a free bottle of water every day, a full length mirror, safe, flat screen TV, comfortable chair, and lots of working space for the desk. Best of all -- free, and fast wifi that you can use on all of your devices (most other hotels just give you a single username and password that can be used for only one connection, but at Suitedreams, I have my laptop, blackberry, and ipod all connected). The staff is super helpful. They accommodated all my needs: setting up transport in the morning to get to meetings, calling popular restaurants for dinner reservations, free printing of materials I needed for work, lending me an iron and ironing board, offering to prepare a special breakfast for me when I have to leave at 5am, and lending me utensils when I brought some groceries and wanted to eat in my room. One of the front desk staff, Francesco, is especially commendable - he is the personification of initiative. Without even asking, he seems to know the best solution or have a recommendation for whatever you need. And if all that wasn't enough, they even have freshly baked chocolate croissants for breakfast.

There's a plenty of hotels in the area like the Suitederams, one floor of an apartment building refurbished. I think there're at least two-three others in the same building as Suitedreams in fact. What all have in common, at least based on my fife attempts there, is the fairly minimalistic design, basic but relevant breakfast and half-present staff. What Suitedreams has compared to the others is always friendly and competent staff and very pleasant design that makes you feel cosy in the rooms, almost like in a five star hotel. Rooms in other similar hotels I tried would almost make me depressed by limited space, simplicity, showers that could barely fit a half of me etc. You won't get this here. Sum up: Main Pros - my favourite location (walking distance to all key sights in fact) - excellent staff - nice, clean, pleasant rooms Main Cons - often loud nights which has nothing to do with the hotel but just with the proximity to via Nazionale.

We liked the fact that this hotel is only one floor above ground level, meaning we did not have to use the elevator, but could simply walk up one flight of stairs. Of course, the elevator is there to use, if you prefer. I enjoy the quietness and attention a guest receives from a small hotel, and this hotel definitely provides both. The location is close to a metro station, bus lines, train station, unlimited number of restaurants, shopping and the sights of Rome. We felt very safe (of course, taking the usual Rome precautions against pickpocketers, such as not taking passports, credits cards or large sums of money in your purse or pockets.), walking everywhere, including back to the hotel from restaurants in the evening. The staff is outstanding. Each staff member that we dealt with was very top-notch and pleasant.

There were boiled eggs, meats, cheeses, great breads (including delicious croissants), cereals, yoghurt, juices, water, milk, coffee, and more. Their bowl of fresh cut-up strawberries, kiwi and melon was outstanding.

There was a spacious vanity with double sinks and plenty of room for cosmetic cases. The hairdryer was a good one, so that I did not have to use the one I had brought.

We stayed here a total of 2 nights with our children ages 11 and 14. Our room was equipped for 4 people, so our bathroom was larger. The room is very contemporary and the bathroom was so clean with double sinks. There is a separate huge tub and separate shower. Immaculately clean. The Closet area was the largest of any hotel we have stayed in and made it easy to put away our 4 suitcases. I do have to admit that if we were staying for 4 days, the room might be too small for 4 people. But for only 2 days it was perfect. If my husband and I were staying in Rome, we would absolutely stay here. ROOM: THE room was very modern and clean. Since they made out the sofa into a queen bed, I don\u2019t really know what the room looked like with a sofa. Our two kids slept on the sofa bed. The room was very quiet so they must have good insulation. We were the last room at the end of the hall, farthest away from the breakfast and reception counter. It seemed larger than some of the rest since we had 4 people. BATHROOM: The shower is a treat as it\u2019s one of those rain showers and very organic with the stone. The double sinks were so great for 4 people trying to get ready and tons of counter space. What can I say about the tub. It is huge. We didn\u2019t have time to use it. They had a both a bide and toilet and I loved the flooring. LOCATION: Great location. The hotel lobby is on the 2nd floor so you need to take the elevator. But that wasn\u2019t a problem at all. We stayed at this property also for the location. The subway stop is right around the corner and the subway takes you to most of the major sites. SERVICE: There was some type of mistake on our reservation. Our reservation was for the same room, but it hadn't been noted it was for 4, instead of two.

Depending on the time you have if you're going to the Colosseum we'd recommend opting for the hand held audio tour - in our case the queue was shorter and you can linger longer to imagine the spectacle in its heyday...We spent a day exploring the Colosseum and the Forum. Again depending how long you've got don't forget to get off the beaten track, explore the back streets. There are some great museums, we really enjoyed the Capitolini. Some astonishing sculpture and artwork - amazed at how close you can get to these. We were there over the weekend - Sunday had a different feel - the road Via dei Fori Imperiali near the Colosseum was closed to traffic allowing you to wander freely and get different views of the area. If you're arriving at Fiumicino we'd suggest enquiring about a shuttle bus service into the city, it depends where your hotel is. It worked well for us and cost Euro 30 for two and delivered us to the hotel!

We had very high expectations from reading the Trip Advisor reviews. This property is in an ok position in the City, however, due to the very hot weather we found walking too far with our daughter not an enjoyable experience and took full advantage of the reasonable taxi service. Our room was modern with a double bed (2 singles together) and a separate bed for our daughter. The mattresses firm and ok but not madly comfortable. Ample wardrobe space and a spacious modern and clean bathroom. Bring your own travel kettle and supplies if you like tea/coffee in your room. I couldn't sleep at 4am due to the room being too hot, and try as I may I could not get the air conditioning unit to come on, so that was an uncomfortable night. Unlike most \"hotels\" there is no information booklet in the room. Personally we felt this would have been very helpful, certainly regarding the immediate area (restaurants, facilities, bus tours, metro etc). There is a recommended restaurant list at reception but it is under a glass top and not apparently available to take away. Unfortunately we were unable to connect our laptop to the WiFi, but there is free internet access for guests we used. We had a view of a side street and a fair amount of traffic noise from the nearby main road, especially during the week. Breakfast was a fairly basic continental affair. One morning there was a gorgeous fresh fruit salad, but that was the only day out of four we were there. Staff on the reception were helpful - some more than others, but no-one unpleasant. All spoke good English, apart from the gentleman on the evening we arrived. We were happy eating out at local restaurants, and if you take the time to wander away from the main thoroughfares you are rewarded with great Italian Cafe/Bars. We took a tour with the 110 bus service. 15 euros per adult for a 24 hour ticket. Takes two hours to do a full City Tour, which you can hop off and on at all the major stops, and you pick the bus up a few minutes walk from Suite Dreams. One general tip is regarding taking a taxi to/from the City from Rome Ciampino Airport. There is a flat 30 euro fare - do not be tempted by the rogue taxi drivers who offer a fare for more than this (one aggressive taxi driver on the night we arrived wanted 60 euros - and he got a couple of women to agree to it). There appeared to be some sort of security guard overseeing the taxi rank and the police nearby, but they completely ignored the rogue driver who caused an obstruction with his taxi, and was clearly flouting the 30 euro rule.

Roma Termini is about a 15 minute walk, or a 2 minute walk to the metro and then travel 1 stop to Termini. A light breakfast is provided in a small breakfast room each morning. The hotel staff is friendly and accommodating and can provide a wealth of information about the city. It is possible, through the hotel, to arrange for a limo to and from Fiumicino Airport...we did so this time but next time we will take the commuter train from the airport to the Termini and walk to the hotel....due to traffic conditions the limo ride is about an hour....the train takes 20 minutes. We will definitely stay at Suite Dreams on our next visit to Rome.

The location of the hotel was important because i was arranging the transport to and from the airport and itinery of the trip. Suitedreams is quite close to the termini station about 7 mins walk and a couple of minutes from the metro although i chosefor us to get the 'bus shuttle' from outside the airport direct to the termini station. We flew into Rome with easy jet who also sell tickets for this service. Our only advice on this is although easyjet charge the same price for the service wait until you are outside the terminal and see which bus has arrived as there are several different buses offering the same service and run every half hour or so eg terrivision is one of them. You can pay the driver or ticket person who greets the bus direct and its a pretty good system which costs between 4-4.50 euros each return. The journey is non stop and takes about 40mins. On arriving at the termini with our map we walked to suitedreams and found the hotel quite easy to find as other trip advisors had warned of its difficult location so with that in mind we looked very carefully for the suitedreams sign.(which is small) There is a small old fashioned lift to take you to the first floor of the hotel where we were warmly welcomed by the softly spoken owner who throughout the trip gave us much advice and recommendations. For dinner one evening the owner recommended a restaurant in the 'local Village' and wrote a note to the owner of this restaurant to look after 'his' guests and we were treated like royalty given champagne and extra dishes to try which we were not charged for. The hotel itself is not luxurious but it is modern, clean, warm and very comfortable and in my opinion faultless. In your fridge you have bottles of complimentary water, there is a flat screen tv which does have 1 english channel which i think was bbc but to be honest you don't go to rome to watch tv so think its a very british thing to moan about not having english tv channels!!!!! Breakfast is served as a buffet style which is very sufficient and plentiful, typically continental toast, cheeses, meats, cakes, cereals, yoghurts etc.... the breakfast room was never busy so you never felt rushed to finish as we have experienced in other european cities.

All in all we had a lovely stay at the hotel and can (and have already) recommend it to our friends. Yes, it is not a five-star grand hotel but considering the rate, location, rooms, and service we did feel we were getting good value for the money spent. Location - The hotel is excellently located near the Repubblica metro station and also several busses pass by. Also it is not far from some of the sights so walking to many places is an option as well. But as the hotel is located on a small side street we never found noices from outside the problem. Spotting the hotel - The hotel is not that easy to spot from the street as it doesn't have its own grand entrance and entering a hotel feels more like entering a private residence in a block of flats. Service - the staff members were all very helpful at all times and friendly, and made us feel \"at home\" so to say. Rooms - the rooms were clean and spacious and modern. There was a lot of storage space. Especially the bathroom made a good impression. The rooms were not \"soundproof\" however and we did hear basically everything from the corridor and I am sure if someone would have bothered listening outside our door they would have heard our discussion as well. We did not consider this a problem, however, as we never found the noices too loud. Breakfast - Breakfast room was never too full and we always found space although it was on the small side. Breakfast selection was not too ample and focused a bit too much on the sweet items for our taste but still - it was a rather good basic breakfast and got us until lunch time so no complaints there. Restaurants and shops nearby - There seemed to be a quite many restaurants and shops in the nearby area. We did only try one restaurant in the neighbourhood also recommended by the hotel but did not quite get value for money there. A Spar grocery store was a couple blocks away and that we used often. How to get there from the airport / our experience. - We wanted to save some money so we took the train from the airport to Termini and then metro to the hotel. Yes, taking the train to Termini was a good idea but using the metro for one stop was not. All in all, we ended up walking a lot underground and dragging our luggage up and down the stairs. In hindsight, I would have taken the taxi from Termini to the hotel. Although walking might seem a good idea as the hotel is not that far away from Termini either, I would recommend considering it twice. There is a lot of traffic, the pedestrian streets there are narrow and the Termini surroundings did not feel the safest, so with heavy luggage taxi for us would have been a good option.

Positives: The staff was very helpful. They reccomended some great places to visit for sightseeing, dining and shopping. You dont need more than 2 days to see Rome. The hotel location was great. You get free drinking water in the mini fridge. Tips: Do NOT buy the 'Roma Pass' if you dont plan on going to 5 museums or more. The Vatican is not included in the Roma Pass and it is primarily the only thing that is not free in Rome of key interest. It is better to get a Metro Pass for 7Euros for 3 days.

The hotel is situated in the middle of the city of Rome on Via Modena St. near the piazza della republica. A quaint and very quiet hotel with no smoking allowed anywhere inside. The hotel is located inside a building along with several other business, it occupys one floor of the hotel with an old fashioned elevator in the middle for quick access. The hotel lacks all kinds of amenities except it does have a TV, fridgerator and safe thats about it in your room. We got a triple room it has a queen bed and a twin bed in it for the little one. If you book your reservation on their web site you get free breakfast which I have now learned I can get coffee any time of day. Things here you don't have as in an american hotel. 1. A microwave in your room. 2. A pool in the hotel. 3. The elevator is old and the doors are small to get in and out of the hotel, bring small luggage. 4. One public computer for everyone in the hotel, there is free wireless throughout the hotel and I would defently recommend bringing your laptop to download all those pictures and videos you will take of the city. For the most part you can find other hotels in this area with more aminenties but for the price and the beautiful quiet at night to rest. The rooms are spotless down to every little corner! I feel very comfortable playing with my little one on the floor without getting dirty at all, bring a little toys for them. The rooms are small except for the bathrooms which are quite comfortable. It rains a lot this time of year so bring an umbrella or rain gear because your feet will get soaked walking around even just a little. I like the beds they are soft but firm foam on everyone so you don't disturb anyone getting up. The people running this place are very nice and all will go out of their way to help you with anything you would like. The electricity is controlled by your card key when you come in your room you put your card key into a little slot and the light is triggered by the card which turns on all the electricity in the room. If you remove the card key the timer turns off all the electricity automatically and there is no way to turn anything on unless the card key is in the slot. I think this is unpleasant when there is only one card key and if someone leaves the room to get coffee early in the morning the others sleeping in the room can't turn on anything if you take the card key. The hotel seems to be designed to make you get out and enjoy the city instead of providing creature comforts.

But the rooms are spacious and modern with free wifi, like a stylish hotel. The bed is very comfortable. The room had plenty of storage, parquet floors, and the bedroom and bath were immaculately clean. Breakfast was a nice simple buffet. Plenty of breads, fruit, cheese, ham and juice. Simple but more than adequate. There was a Nespresso machine in the breakfast area which was nice also. Location was good, 2 minutes from the Republica metro stop. Maybe 10 minutes stroll from Termini station. 15 minutes in the other direction, taking your time, and you're at the Trevi fountain. Lots of decent restaurants in the area. I ate a Target around the corner (which may be owned by the people who run Suitedreams, they recommended it, but it was a good recommendation). While the hotel was in a busy neighborhood, the street was area was generally quiet at night, and I had no trouble sleeping. Minor quibbles, my room had a mini bar refrigerator with some soda, free water, beer, etc., and left space for you to put in other things if you want, but it barely worked. My entry into my room was delayed a little bit when I arrived, while they worked on the AC. It was never really cool in the room, but for November, no problem. On the plus side, aside from the very nice rooms and breakfast, the staff was great. Extremely friendly, welcoming and very helpful. I mentioned casually (to Francesco, I think, I'm terrible with names) that if the weather held up one day, I may go to Hadrian's villa. When I came back later that evening, he had printed out information and mapped out how to get there. He and others were genuinely nice people, very helpful and friendly. The hotel is a good value for Rome, where hotels always seem expensive. I paid ~ 110 Euro which is very good for the room, breakfast and location. There are a lot of hotels in Rome and all in all, ranking Suitedreams as #2 out of 1300+ seems a little high, but not outrageously. Its not a super luxury hotel, but rooms are very good; location is good, but not spectacular, and it doesn't have the amenities some people my expect in a hotel (gym, restaurant or room service for example). But it is a good value, the staff is great and it doesn't really miss anywhere. All in all, I do recommend this hotel.

I booked this hotel based on the recommendations from TripAdvisor. I was really excited to get there and had even email Pier prior to our stay. Being a small boutique hotel, they did not have vacancy for all of the nights we would be in Rome. Given that this would require us to pack/unpack an additional time, I asked if it was possible for them to offer some kind of small discount to incentify us to stay. It is important to note that I was completely ok with them saying no and told them that. Heck, it was our decision and we could have stayed somewhere else if it was that big of deal. I really just thought I would ask - thinking it wouldnt hurt to ask. Pier did offer a discount, which I thought was excellent service. Above and beyond even. Fastforward to Nov 18. After a long day of travel with our 1.5 year old daughter, we get to the Suite Dreams. At first, we didnt know if we were even there but saw the small sign. We were travelling in Europe for a few weeks and had a lot of bags. So I ran up stairs to check in. Pier said \"ah, we were waiting for you\". Then he said he needed my husband and I to both be present with our passports to check in. I went back downstairs and helped by husband put our bags into a very small lift. I carried my daughter upstairs and waited for my husband to return. It was then when I got the look of death. Pier spent the next 30 minutes lambasting us for bringing our daughter. He accused us of purposely not telling him in order to get a cheaper room. He said \"you managed to ask for a discount, but failed to mention that you had a 3rd person\". Now, I had booked 5 hotels in Europe for Novemeber and NONE of them told me to indicate an additional person with a 1.5 year old. In fact, I was advised not to. With kids this young, their presence does not have an incremental cost anyway so it is generally a non-issue. I tried to explain this and he said he didnt care how other hotels operated. He was being so incredible rude. In my mind, I was thinking - holy crap, is he going to kick us to the curb? Where in the world will we stay on this short of notice. It looked like it took everything he had to let us stay and he started showing us around. He was still shaking with anger. My opinion is that if was going to permit us to stay, he could have saved the half hour reaming upon arrival. I sat in my hotel room completely unravelled. The next day I asked the receptionist to remove the discount. I felt so uncomfortable. **The breakfast was nice, the rooms were nice but I felt like an unwelcome guest. And this is very much a feeling of a bed and breakfast- so if you dont like those, you will not like this hotel. The reception area is a small desk in the 1 hallway of the hotel. Rooms are along the hallway. You must walk by the reception area to get to the breakfast area. Everything is on 1 floor.** We ran into Pier one other time and it was upon checkout. He had acted like nothing was wrong and asked us to stay again. He helped us get a different cab since the one we got was too small for all of our bags. It was a complete Jekyll & Hyde scenerio. It was hard to rate this hotel. Given the horrible way my husband and I felt upon arrival and service that is unprecendently low - I have to give this a 2 rating. Had it not been for the seriously foul attitude of Pier upon arrival, I would have rated it a 3.5. In closing, I really hope that I dont get a smarmy response from the SuiteDreams.

It was my wife\u2019s 40th birthday on the 13th September and I had already informed the hotel that this was our reason for staying. When we came back to our Rome on the afternoon of the 13th they had made up a card and left us a bottle of wine. It was a very nice touch and very appreciated. The owner was very welcoming and helpful. Make sure you book your hotel direct with the hotel and you will get all your breakfasts free. (normally ten euro each) If you have already booked with another agency, email the hotel and you can cancel your booking and book with them direct and get the same room and your breakfasts free. Excellent communication by email from the hotel. Found the bed the first night uncomfortable and asked for second pillows. Promptly provided and this made a big difference. There is a lot of city noise but you have to expect that as Rome is a very busy city day and night. Everything in the room worked fine and we had no problems. There is a safe in the room which was excellent and no deposit required. We thought breakfast was a bit basic but after seeing what was on offer in local cafe's and restaurants and their prices we realised it was a good breakfast and will keep you going to late afternoon If you pay by cash you get 5% discount which would have saved us \u00a341. We paid by card and when we came home we found that the by using the card we had got a better exchange rate than changing money at post office at home and paying by cash but that it only saved us \u00a310 as opposed to \u00a341. So might be worth bringing cash to pay your bill which you can do even though you used your card to book hotel. Transport From airport Taxi = 75 Euro Hotel Transfer = 55 Euro Airport Transfer 39 Euros Train each = 11 Euro Train leaves from airport, express to Stazione Termini. This leaves you about half a mile from hotel. We used the train and it was great. Felt a bit weary coming through the streets at 12mn with our cases and money on us. The City We weren\u2019t very impressed with Rome. It is very overrated and very over priced. (for example 3.50 Euro for a small can of coke from a roadside stall). One guy at the Spanish Steps tried to charge us 200 Euro for a trip around the city centre on a horse and cart, when we said no the price was reduced to 150 Euro and when we said no again and walked away they came after us and offered it then for 80 Euro. But by then we then didn\u2019t trust them at all. Be prepared to pay a lot of money for tourist quality meals when eating out. We ended up eating McDonalds, burger King, a take away Chinese and even cheese and ham rolls. We got sick of eating pizza that didn\u2019t taste as good as our local at home. Even the lasagnes and spaghettis weren\u2019t as good as you would make yourself at home from a jar. Only nice place we ate was an Irish bar just down the main street two blocks from the hotel on the left \u201cFlan O\u2019Brien\u201d Pity we didn\u2019t find it until the last day! T-bone Station recommended by the hotel was good too. Target restaurant is expensive and overrated. They say the Roman Army marched on its stomach....must have been looking something descent to eat! The Vatican and other churches in Rome are groaning with wealth while people in the world starve. We saw one Nun walk around a street beggar who had only wished her good evening. We found all this quite upsetting and contradictory to religious teachings of the church. No point in bringing your Sat Nav.

We travelled to Rome for a friends wedding with one day spare to go sightseeing, other friends stayed in the Trastevere area and complained that it was much more of a walk to get to the sights than we had at SD. The location of the hotel is fab, almost all the sights are walking distance (definitely take your flat shoes if you go to Rome) we spent an entire day from 8am to 10pm walking around taking in the sights whilst we were there and the location of the hotel meant that we were never too far away, the only limitation we had was time! The hotel was very easy to find, our taxi driver dropped us off right outside after coming from Ciamparo airport, but please be warned that the fare really shouldn't be much more than 30 euros, there is (in theory) a flat rate to and from Rome city centre of 30 euros but we got stung by a con-artist taxi driver who told us that 'due to protests in the city centre he couldn't honour that amount'.........we ended up having THE most dangerous taxi journey there AND THEN he charged us 50 euros for the pleasure. I know the hotel can arrange taxi pickups so i really would advise this so as to not get caught out like we did. Hotel is very small and on the first floor but there is a lift although I much prefer to take the stairs (cases and all) and we arrived at least 3 hours early and our room was ready for us already which was brilliant. Everything about the hotel is very modern, clean cut, fresh and minimalistic. I would suggest that if you are looking for a slice of old world Rome this is not the hotel for you, although you will find more than enough history right on your doorstep. The bottle of water for each guest in the room each day is brilliant to take out when you go sightseeing as Rome can get mighty hot (even in mid october) and the air con was used every day when we got back. Bed is very comfy and we slept incredibly well, the black out blind is also a good noise reducer, as being relatively central i'm sure we should have heard more noise from outside than we actually did. Bathroom is great size and the slate shower and enclosure is fantastic. Breakfast selection (which we only got one day to try out) was really good, its a great selection of 'Continental' items, pastries, cakes, cereals, fruit and the tassimo machine is great fun if you can work out how to use it!! Being such a small hotel this breakfast set up is perfect, I guess if you want a bigger cooked breakfast you'd be able to walk less than 5 minutes and find somewhere but we filled up nicely on the lovely fruits and breads etc and were set for the day. The staff at the hotel were great, were really great helping us arrange transport to the wedding we were attending and sorted out items such as ironing boards, irons, hairdryers, DVD's without hesitation, the maps on the front desk are invaluable to carry around and the hotel staff will point out all the attractions and ways to get around. They also have a handy guide to the restaurants they recommend, we went to the one opposite the opera house which was very nice (but please do remember to order sides with any main courses, i ended up with a dinner of two very lonely lamb cutlets on a plate!!) and the location was less than 5 mins away, also walked past the restaurant (target?) below the hotel which looked really great too, just didn't get a chance to eat there. Overall I'd definitely recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again, without us even realising it the place made our brief city break a whole lot more enjoyable. Upon speaking to our friends at the wedding we all attending over in Rome, who had all stayed in Trastevere, we were astonished to find how much our opinions of Rome, Roman Italians and the area varied. Where as our friends were disgusted at the amount of litter, graffiti and dog mess in 'Rome', we had completely the opposite opinion and were saying how clean and litter/graffiti free the city was in comparison to London. Without having heard other people's opinions I guess we wouldn't have realised how lucky we were to stay in such a nice area, nice location and such a well kept part of the city. Before my trip I was slightly concerned about the cost of staying at SuiteDreams but I can assure you it is worth every penny. My only other recommendation is whilst you're in Rome do visit Piazza Navona, its only through a recommendation that we visited there and it really was beautiful, took our breath away and had a fantastic meal on the edge of the square as artists bustled around and music played in the background...........my absolute favourite memory of Rome :) I hope you enjoy Rome as much as we did.", "Date": "October 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Value": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa", "Title": "\u201cFABULOUS HOTEL\u201d", "Author": "Coco26Ottawa", "ReviewID": "UR47366246", "Content": "I absolutely loved this hotel and especially the staff.

The gentleman at the desk, gave us a map, highlighted areas to walk through and gave us recommendations to eat. This man was right on with all of his dinner recommendations! We told him how impressed we were with the places he told us to eat. He explained that the hotel owner routinely visits restaurants and creates a list of places that he would want to eat. The owner is not affiliated with any restaurants and does not receive commissions. He only recommends places that he thoroughly enjoys. If you stay at this hotel, be sure to get the restaurant recommendations. The first night out, my husband commented that he was nervous about where we were staying because there weren't many people around. Come to find out, we were within a block of the President's house in Italy. Needless to say, there were all sorts of polizia, local and national, always visible around the area we stayed. There was no reason whatsoever to feel unsafe. Once we got the lay of the land, we were much more confident in our choice. The hotel is ideally located for walking around Rome. We were able to get to most places within a 20 minute walk. Many places were closer than this. The hotel staff also explained how to use the bus system, which was very easy once they helped introduce us to the stops, etc. We chose to walk most of the time to walk off all the food we were eating. The breakfast was a continental buffet. It was adequate, nothing fancy. We had plenty to choose from each morning. The hotel staff also arranged for our ride to the airport, and it was cheaper than taking a cab. The bed was very comfortable, and the room was air conditioned.

Big thanks for Frederico on reception who tried to sort out a problem with our car (don't trust Avis) - anyway, he tried his best but as it was bank holiday the next day he was not getting anywhere with Avis - the upshot was we had to pick up the car and drive it a car park and if you thinking of driving in Rome - don't - you can get seriously caught out by the central congestion zone and even the romans who gave us directions (there were several) could not tell us how to avoid going into it - as a tourist you cannot buy a pass you havew to be a resident to drive in the centre. Anyway, best guide book was Time Out - try Macherroni if you can - reception will book you a nice table - also we arrived at lunchtime and had a meal at Target Pizzeria on the corner of the hotel building - it was very nice. We did not find Rome particularly pricey but then we are used to London and yes if you do sit on the really obvious touristy places you will get ripped off but that is the same the world over! I agree with another reviewer about the Vatican city - we went into the Museum (only to see the sistine chapel) and the sheer amount of gold and precious objects on display was obscene and very vulgar - how hypocritical! I am not expecting them to rip the frescoes off the walls but really - what about the starving poor in any catholic countries in the world?? at 15 euros a ticket that was the only time I felt like I was being ripped off in Italy - if you go to the basilica of St francis at Assisi it is the complete antithesis of St Peters.", "Date": "September 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cGREAT VALUE/COMFORTABLE RESPITE\u201d", "Author": "sloh", "ReviewID": "UR44189926", "Content": "We were in two different rooms for 5+1 nights in AUG/SEP 2009 with a Mediterranean cruise in between.

We arrived in Rome by train and chose the hotel because of its proximity to the central train station, and of course, its excellent tripadvisor reputation. We were not disappointed. To say that Rome is hot in July is a major understatement. It is hard to describe how hot it actually is, but while we were there it felt like you could have baked a pizza on the pavement. Needless to say we made frequent and grateful use of the free drinking water fountains on many street corners and were very glad to come back to SuiteDreams each evening, not least because our room was so well air-conditioned. The hotel is situated just off the Via Nationale which is very central (or as central as you can be in a city where all the sights are spread so far from one another). The hotel is in an apartment block and is only marked at street level by a discreet plaque. This gave us a thrill as it felt like we were being admitted to an actual private Roman residence, and not merely a 'touristy' hang-out. The fact that we looked like perspiring lobsters for most of the trip somewhat ruined this illusion though! Our room was very sleek and comfortable, with a modern and elegant bathroom. Others have mentioned the free mineral water provided each day. We too thought this was a nice touch. Breakfast was served in a suitably chic breakfast room and consisted of an excellent selection of fruit juices, breads, croissants, toast and cereals, with a lovely self service coffee machine which I had great fun with each morning. The staff were very professional and courteous and kindly agreed to look after our cases on the final day after we had checked out but before we were ready to leave the city. If you are looking for a grand and majestic hotel, this is not it. SuiteDreams is less of a hotel and more of a sophisticated and quiet apartment. But then who goes to Rome to sit in their hotel? I am neither trendy, nor a minimalist, so I felt an incredible urge to liven up the decor slightly with a few flowery cushions or a nice big squashy armchair, and perhaps it does take itself a little too seriously, but apart from that, we loved it and wouldn't think of staying anywhere else on what will inevitably be future return trips to Rome.", "Date": "August 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cFunky, Friendly and Fantastic!!\u201d", "Author": "Jaxxy09", "ReviewID": "UR36446615", "Content": "After spending three nights with my 21 year old daughter at Suitedreams I can see why Rome's hidden gem was voted No 1 on Trip Advisor.

There is a strict non-smoking policy in the hotel which I have no problem with, however my boyfriend had one cigarette out the large window in our room on our first morning and then left the window open to air out the room. When we returned to the hotel that afternoon after sightseeing, I received a phonecall from Pier explaining that there was to be no smoking, which I didnt argue with and respected (in fact, I was very embarassed that he knew & I completely respected the fact that we did break the rule) he then went on to tell me that if rules and regulations were not adhered to he has to get the police involved, he was rather threatening in his tone which i did not like and after the phonecall again as Shellyburger had mentioned we felt very uncomfortable around him. There was only luke warm water one afternoon which I was very upset about about as was so sore after walking around Rome all day, Pier did offer if we wanted to have a shower in another room were the water was hot, but I felt that was unacceptable as I wanted a hot shower in my own room but I was too afraid of him to argue!

Plenty of storage, and a sizeable safe, contrasted by a small, somewhat cramped bathroom w/ shower only (did not stay in the suite--occupied) and limited counter space. The towel warmer did not work. The staff was fluent in many languages; accomodating and friendly but we did not feel overly pleasant or helpful. There are able to assist with most activities, but we received only modest assistance with city/sight directions and transportation issues. They do offer a list of recommended restaurants, they are mostly above average and worth visiting. Our room was not ready upon arrival (before check-in), they offered to store our luggage, but it is left in the hallway along side the check-in desk, not locked in a storage area. Upon return, our room was not ready at the promised time. (The staffing is minimal and maid service and breakfast room staff are slow--based on the workload.) We were switched to an alternate room. I asked if the room was quiet and was assured it was---it was not. All the floors are wooden and they transmit any movement in the hallways, or adjoining rooms. There is little, if any outside noise. We were in the hallway near the entry door and heard it shut/slam everytime someone was not careful closing it. The hotel is reasonably priced (they have an upcharge on the weekends) but certainly not a 'value'. You can do much better--price wise-- during low season. The desk clerk did not offer the discount for cash--until reminded about it. We were offered 5% and it is hardly worth the risk of amassing the cash for the savings. We found this hotel to be a good solid choice, but I am in disagreement with many of the reviews posted suggesting it it more then it is.

I could go on. - Stupidly I managed to leave my laptop in the taxi and only noticed when checking in - thankfully the taxi driver came back (phew!) but in the meantime the staff were incredibly helpful and supportive in trying to track it down by phoning every number they had. For guests only staying a few nights they went beyond the call of duty and I was genuinely impressed. I went with my girlfriend and we both loved it - it really is boutique in style and put together really well which meant she thought I must have paid more than I did which didn't hurt! We could easily walk everywhere we wanted. Breakfast was pretty much self-service but had a good and healthy spread. Check their website & if you can get an available room, stay here as it's a very good 3*+ option.
