Although this was not my favorite hotel stay, it was not that bad either. The positives about this hotel is the location and the breakfast. If you are looking to stay away from the main center of Venice than this is perfect. I would have loved to stay a little closer to the main square but this was not far at all. The hotel breakfast was really good and as a celiac I found many things I could eat including eggs, fruit and meat. The hotel staff were decent but definitly not overly nice. I personally would have been very grateful if they could have helped more with finding a gluten free restaurant. A few times I asked the staff to call a place to see if I could eat there and they really made me feel like I was bothering them. My husband and I both felt as though the staff could have been a lot more helpful and warm. Every hotel we stayed at was very helpful with helping me find places to eat except this one. The bed was also not my favorite at all. Basically it was 2 twin beds pushed together and so you could really feel the slit down the middle. It was not very comfortable but I will say it was very clean. I would personally never stay here again but it really is not bad for a quick stay at a moderate price.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cOnly minor snags.\u201d", "Author": "stevemof", "ReviewID": "UR128010943", "Content": "A clean and comfortable hotel with really friendly and helpful staff.

Arrival to this hotel is very easy, go to the hotel's website and read \"how to reach\" section. They have given best possible routes to this hotel. Best way is to reach is to take vaporetto's (water taxi's) from Piazza Roma to Sant' Elena stop which is cheapest and you can see grand canal and San Marco Plaza on the way, which are the main centers of attractions. From the Sant' Elena stop just walk few meters and hotel is right there. It is not visible from the stop as the entrance of the hotel is inside a street. It is located at very quiet and cosy place, green gardens nearby, you can walk upto San Marco Plaza within 15 minutes. There are not many restaurants around this place, so you would need to go to San Marco Plaza for meals or eat at hotel. There are few local restaurants around but close early, around 10. Venice is safe, we used to walk late nights and people were usually there and vaporetto's shut down by 11. Murano/Burano is also closer to Sant' Elena. Hotel staff is very helpful in explaining you where and how to go. Breakfast is really good, lot of variety and cappuccinos should not be missed. Rooms are cosy but small, generally hotel room sizes is entire Italy is smaller than US hotel room sizes. Also there is a 3euro/night city tax that you'll have to pay apart from your reservation. Also HelloVenezia card/pass is very helpful for unlimited transportation for 24/48/72 hours, whatever is your length of stay and can be purchased at lot of places around.

The place was very easy to find from the Sant Elena waterbus stop. We arrived at night and was tired and hungry but check in was quick and we had room service sent up to us within ten minutes of ordering. The area: the hotel is in a lovely little area, away from all the tourists and busy packed streets. It was an extremely quiet and peaceful place to be. The only problems we had was that the nearby church bells rang continuously at 8am every morning. The room: the room was lovely but quite a bit smaller than what I expected. I booked a junior suite which cost me an extra \u00c2\u00a390 but in my opinion it wasn't worth the extra money. The rooms were kept spotlessly clean and had all the amenities you needed and these were replenished as and when needed. The double bed was actually two singles pushed together which normally wouldn't bother me but one of the beds was about 3 inches higher than the other and made the middle of the bed very hard and uncomfy to sleep on which meant if we wanted to cuddle we had to both sleep on one side and so therefore may aswel slept in a single! We also found the full hotel far too hot. The weather was lovely during our stay yet the hotel always seemed to have heating on, even the corridors were way too warm. There is air conditioning in the rooms but we still struggled to get a good nights sleep each night as we were uncomfortable with the temperature. There is a decent sized television in the rooms but to us it was completely useless as there were no English channels so we couldn't understand anything anyway. Service: the service at this hotel, in my view, was brilliant. I emailed the staff at the hotel before I arrived to arrange a bunch of flowers as a surprise for my partners birthday and I had several emails back straight away which I thought was really nice (as were the flowers). We also asked the reception staff many times for directions or recommendations on good restaurants etc and they had no problem in marking them out for us on our map. While we were there we also contacted reception for a an iron and ironing board, a corkscrew and a face cloth which were all brought up straight away.

We stayed on the ground floor in a standard double room which for 5 days was adequate and for the price we paid it was very good value. In general the hotel doesn't excel but neither does it let you down and I think for the price and location it is a safe bet to go for if you like to get away from it all but still not be too far out to cause any issues with getting about.

I asked the next day to move rooms, which I was able to do, and moved to room 214 which was far better with a double sink and no chance of headbutting it!! I was disaapointed by the coffee cups and glasses never being cleaned though - each day just left and not even emptied or cleaned. Not had that before - oh and for some reason you have to ask for those little milk pots every time you want them - they are never left in the room with the tea and coffee - very strange! Overall the hotel seemed clean (although our first room becuase it was so small had suitcase scuff marks all over the walls), and a couple of the staff were nice and friendly, but not all of them. Breakfast was ok - don't go if just for the 'american breakfast' as the hot side is very disappointing, just mushy scrambled eggs and bacon. But the choice of cereals, fruit, croissants etc was good. Wanted to try the restaurant but on 2 occasions this was fully booked - but looking at the prices (about 20 euros a meal, plus cover charge plus service charge) I would eat out elswhere, as there is a strip of restaurants about 5 mins walk away. In terms of getting around, make sure you buy the vapaetto tickets - we bought the 33 euro 3 day ticket use as much as you like. They are very frequent and we got around using these boats really easily. It is about 25 mins walk from St Marks main square, but it is a nice walk, with plenty of vaparetto stops in between to use. Food in the evenings we found disappointing, as all the menus are the same, and pretty expensive for very little. A tip would be to go to Hard rock cafe in central st Marks Square - we had a good big load of food, at about 17 euros for a main meal, which is pretty good given the prices some of the restaurants were charging! Oh and this place has no cover charge or service charge, which is common in most places to eat in Venice. Think thats all - we had a nice stay with 3 days solid exploring Venice. I would recommend to come here, and stay in Best Western, as we liked the quite location and hotel once we changed rooms.", "Date": "December 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Antwerp, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cA fairy tale in real world !!!\u201d", "Author": "manu p", "ReviewID": "UR121116451", "Content": "We stayed in the hotel for our annual weekend with the whole family.

I had to show her my printed out reservation, which showed exactly what I booked, until she finally relented, after speaking to her manager. She then went on to quote me a different price, to which I was booked (a much higher price). Again she argued with me, until I showed her my printed reservation which showed how much I had agreed to pay. Once in the room, it was, to say the least, \"ok.\" Every single wall had deep scuff marks on them. Not one, not two, but DOZENS of black scuff marks. The mini bar had dried coffee and god knows what else, all over it. The bathroom had mildew, rust, cracks, and an all around poor condition about it. I tried to connect to the internet, using their hardline (no wifi, for a hotel of this cost?) and couldn't connect.

Fresh fruits, assorted cereals and yogurts, fresh slices of meat and cheese, hard boiled and scrabbled eggs, and homemade bread. The food was so good I had to at least have 2 servings! The coffee was amazing, it had a good nutty taste that I didn't even need to use any sugar. Dinner was good as well. We ate there twice out of the 4 nights there. portions were decent. Enough food to be full if you plan on having 3 courses. They had a 'flan' on as a starter, which was a creamy cheese and spinach combination. I had that each time we had dinner in the restaurant, and I highly recommend that dish. Usually I just chew and swallow my food, but this I had to savoir. Our room was good, decent size. The bathroom was fairly clean, and the shower was a little small. The walls and ceiling looked like they needed a paint job. The ceiling had some water stains and walls were scratched. The thermostat wasn't too great either. Our room was very warm even when we had the air on. For some reason the lowest it went was 17 degrees Celsius. Having the window open was much cooler. Other than that, the towel, linen, and furniture was clean. There is internet connection in the building but it's very slow so you might as well not even bother. It will drive you nuts.

We arrived at the hotel late at night (10:30 pm) after 12 hours of traveling, and we couldn't have anything to eat because the restaurant was fully booked and was about to close around that time!! The nearby bar was also closed so we had to sleep hungry! The next day, again we had the same problem during lunch time.The restaurant is only open from 7-10:30 pm and you can order from room service only in this certain hours. Therefore, if you choose to stay there, you should always remember to return in your room not hungry!! However, the location of the hotel is excellent as other visitors also say (in a walking distance from piazza san marko, through beautiful parks) and the venice is so beautiful that helps you to forget negative things. Also, we appreciate highly that the hotel's customer care supervisor answered right away to our evaluation remarks and gives promise that they will try to solve the mentioned problems.", "Date": "November 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canberra, Australia", "Title": "\u201cFantastic value for money and large rooms - particularly for Venice\u201d", "Author": "tristanr", "ReviewID": "UR85524145", "Content": "We booked this hotel in advance through the hotel's website and got an excellent rate.

It's a lovely walk to Piazza San Marco or the Arsenale, across canals and along the waterfront. If you're willing to spend the money, you can get there quicker in a vaporetto (they call it a water-bus, but it is certainly a lot more expensive than normal public transport). The location also seems to affect the price - the Sant'Elena is a little cheaper than equivalent hotels closer to central Venice.

This bed and pillow were the most comfortable to me of all our hotels in Italy but my husband found them a little too firm. Both the bedroom & bathroom were large & very clean. The bathroom had double sinks & was well stocked. The room had a mini-frig & coffee/tea service as well as t.v. & central air that didn't make noise. Very peaceful. The breakfast buffets were outstanding!

On arrival, we took the no. 1 vaporreto down the Grand Canal, all the way to the hotel. We took no. 51 to the train station when we left. The rest of the time we walked everywhere & enjoyed the views until we got to the tourist crowds near San Marco. The area where the hotel is located felt quite safe in the evening and family friendly. For less able-bodied people, the vaporreto stop is about a block from the hotel through a park. One can buy tickets at the tabbachi stand in the park near the dock. The hotel has free internet once you get a code from the desk & English newspapers. There was a personal safe in our room, which we used. The desk staff was very knowledgeable when asked a specific question. This hotel is an excellent value if one doesn't want to be in the midst of crowds and noise & enjoys walking.

We stayed in 2 groundfloor rooms which opened onto the garden. A minor complaint is that the grass was not very well kept in the garden. The rooms were spacious and clean and had modern bathrooms with two wash basins. The breakfast buffet offered a good variety of hot and cold food, but it is a pity that the servers in the restaurant did not smile much.

This old Convent has been very nicely converted. A friendly, modern hotel 20 minutes walk from Piazza San Marco or two stops on the Vaporetto. A great location in a quiet residential area, out of the way of the hustle and bustle of the Venice tourist traps, but still a convenient location to see the beautiful city of Venice. The only real disadvantage to the hotels location is the lack of eating opportunities within the immediate vicinity (apart from the hotel), however there are many restaurants about 10 minutes in to the walk towards Venice centre or one stop on the Vaporetto. A superb continental buffet style breakfast with plenty of choice sets you up for a day in Venice. The best bits - the Gondola ride was great. At 80 euros for 40 minutes it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit steep but a must do while in Venice, as is a coffee in Piazza San Marco, again pricy but a pleasant experience. The view from the top of the campanile is fantastic and well worth the admission. The Peggy Guggenheim museum of modern art is also very good. Fancy a drink, head to the famous Harry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bar near San Marco for a swanky cocktail. Transport - We purchased the public transport pass at the airport, in the arrivals hall. At 33 euros this allowed us to have unlimited use of the bus and Vaporetto for 72 hours. From the airport take the number 5 bus to the end of the line which is Piazza Roma. Then get the Vaporetto (51 and 61 are the fastest and avoid the Grand Canal) to the Sant Elena stop. The hotel is a two minute walk from the stop. Really easy, about a one hour trip from the airport to the hotel in total. We had a great stay and time in Venice, we would almost certainly stay at the Santa Elena if we return to Venice.

The breakfast is also very good with a superb selection of hot and cold food, juices and coffee - it really sets you up for the day.

The water bus stop is very close by and very easy to get around Venice by water bus, about 10 minutes on the water bus to St. Marks Square area. We took a private water taxi from the airport which was 80 euros expensive but only took 30 minutes. Breakfast was plentiful with a great selection of fruit, cereal, cold cut meats, cheeses, mozzarella, tomatoes, toast, pastries, juice, coffee, made to order expresso and cappicino, eggs, sausage and much more. The staff was very courteous and helpful at all times. We prepaid in advance on their website and saved on the rate. It cost us about $600.00 USD total for the three nights. We would definitely stay here when we visit Venice again and would recommend this hotel to others.

The hotel is handily place for the S Elena vaporetto stop. The area appears to be a 1920s development; very quiet except when the local football club, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSS Calcio Venezia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, are playing just across the road; er; canal. They are, apparently, rubbish. The hotel is well furnished in a rather bland manner that seems to be fashionable these days. The monotony is relieved by numerous artworks, including no less than five pleasant and doubtless expensive lithographs in our room, number 218. A glance at the floor plan indicates that bedrooms are all shapes and sizes (as befits a non-purpose-built hotel) and ours was pleasantly large with a nice seating area with two arm chairs, a settee and a coffee table. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own web site offers better rates than the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBest Western\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 website. Specific plus-points are; \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Free broadband connection; Ethernet in all rooms plus wi-fi in some. In a city that is famed for its rip-off internet costs this is a definite plus, even if the hotel policy of dolling out connectivity for twenty-four hours at a time makes this a little more complicated than it need be. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Free tea and coffee making facilities in every room, with a real kettle. Although becoming more common, this is still far from standard across continental Europe. Here, they will even provide fresh milk if asked. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Excellent breakfast buffet. Not only is it a huge spread from bacon & eggs through cereals, bread, meats and cheese through to cakes and pastries; it is all very high quality. The restaurant offers reasonable if somewhat limited fare at prices that are appropriate to a hotel of this class. Service can be somewhat lackadaisical, and drinks are overpriced; \u00e2\u201a\u00ac 5 for an ordinary bottle of beer is outrageous. Surprisingly, this restaurant is closed on Sundays. What purports to be a four-star hotel really should be able to provide meals seven days a week. I am bemused by the comment of the previous reviewer of this hotel that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnearby restaurants were limited and not good, serving mainly locals\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. A very good tip is to go precisely where the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclocals\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 go; they are not daft, they certainly know much more about the area and its restaurants than you and they probably have a disinclination to be ripped off or to suffer poor food and/or bad service. It must be remembered that one of the attractions of this hotel is that it is away from the tourist circuit, so \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclocals\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 will inevitably predominate in this area. And a very good thing that is, too. In truth there are not many restaurants near the hotel, but there is one very close by that is a gem. Looking across the park towards the vaporetto landing stages is the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcVecia Gina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This local bar provides a choice of over forty different pizzas and provides the visitor with a glimpse of everyday Venetian life away from the tourist masses. But not on Wednesdays; their day off. The via Garibaldi (ten minutes walk away) provides a pleasant walk but its restaurants are to be avoided as many are rip-off merchants. These are easy to tell as, unusually for Italy, their prices do not include a service charge, which they the slap on at 12.5% to 15%. These places can be expected to try every trick in the book to squeeze extra Euros out of you; for example, by \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinadvertently\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 giving you a much more expensive bottle of wine than you expected. Counter-intuitively, the easiest place to find reasonable restaurants (as well as local shops) is one stop on the Vaporetto away from Venice at the Lido.", "Date": "March 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Devon, UK", "Title": "\u201cQuiet, smart, but rather impersonal hotel.\u201d", "Author": "capitalstraveller", "ReviewID": "UR25176609", "Content": "Chose this hotel, looking for a quiet location for the Carnevale: this matched expectations and was near to the local vaporetto stop (though the parkland might be a haven for mosquitos in the summer?).

But after reading about this hotel and other reviews, I figured out that BWs in other countries are a bit different. The hotel has a nice location, a bit further out of town, but a very quiet area with a lot of space and a nice park. You're only about 2 minutes from the vaporetto water metro to take you 2 stops into the heart of the action. But you definitely are on the main Venice island which makes a difference b/c you can easily walk into town in 20 minutes. It's a really nice walk since you have water on one side and there's a waterfront path that for about 1/3 of the way has a garden/park on the other side. Venice itself is made up of so many small alleyways that it can get really crowded and chaotic. I think it worked out perfectly to be stayed a bit outside of this area. There were still a lot of restaurants on this main street that about 5-10 minutes from the hotel. The hotel itself is located one block from the vaporetto (if you walk straight back from the vaporetto stop, through the park, it's one block up from there). The entry way is nice and we were met at reception where someone took our luggage up separately and showed us to our room. The decor was really nice, slightly modern -- very different than i would normally expect from BW. We had booked a really great deal that included breakfast and a free room upgrade to a superior room, but when we arrived, we found we had been further upgraded to a 2-level suite! On the bottom level was a little kitchenette and full-size fridge. There was also a TV and 2 single beds. Then there was a full staircase up to the main bedroom which had a huge closet, good size bathroom and a lot of space in the bedroom area. We also got a huge patio that was basically the size of the bedroom! it had a patio set that would have been great to wine or dinner outside, but the weather wasn't good enough for that. Our place was very nicely decorated like the rest of the hotel. The breakfast was great. There were numerous options like hot items, cold meats and cheeses, fruits, cold cereal. Some things were better than others, but there was more than enough to choose from that you could be happy (and full) until the afternoon. The staff was helpful in giving suggestions for restaurants and transportation, etc, although we did hear several other people get directed to the same restaurant for dinner... not sure if it was just one of the only places open this time of year, but you always like to think that they take what you say you're looking to into consideration and not just give their standard response. Service overall was good at the hotel, just a few really small problems that kept me from giving this a 5/5. The hotel doesn't have many staff on hand, which I guess I can understand b/c it was Jan, however the breakfast room was rather crowded so it definitely wasn't just us staying there. It was about 11pm on the first night when I realized we'd forgotten to bring toothpaste so I called down to the front desk and they said they had some, but no one was there to bring it up to us... not a huge deal, but my husband and I were already ready for bed so we didn't want to go down there. The next morning they brought it up no problem. They also had the blowdryer attached to the wall which is my hotel pet peeve b/c they are always like 800 watts or something ridiculously slow. I know this wasn't a 5-star hotel so i don't have huge expectations, but when the wall blowdryer didn't work, I was somewhat relieved, hoping they'd send up a better one. They sent up a mini dryer, probably about the same wattage but i tried it in about 5 different plugs and it wouldn't turn on. Now I was annoyed and a little embarassed to call down yet again, but with wet hair, I did. The woman said she'd sent someone up but I don' t know if she reset the plugs or what b/c then the blowdryer just started up. Overall they just seemed a bit stingy though. For example, when we checked out, they asked several times to confirm that we had left the blowdryer in the room. We had also called down for a wineopener and the guy stood at the door while we opened our bottle of wine as he said 'it was their only opener' ... These things are not a big deal and didn't disrupt our stay at all, they're just the types of service that lead me to give a 4 instead of a 5/5. We would definitely choose this hotel again as the price we paid was great for what we got. Venice hotels are expensive, especially the nicer hotels on the main island of Venice. we liked the location and found it very easy to get into town.

Yes the hotel is 20-25 minutes walk to St Marks Square, but hey your on holiday so enjoy the walk, if you do not want to walk every time then we bought a 3 day Water Bus pass for 31 euros each and found this great value for money as we constantly hopped on and off depending where we wanted to go to.", "Date": "August 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cSant Elena, Best Western\u201d", "Author": "shock123", "ReviewID": "UR18706996", "Content": "Excellent hotel for families with young children. 15 minutes from San Marco and a stones throw from vapretto, 1 stop away from Lido.

Cross the Ritalo Bridge to the fruit market and stalls, the views are fab. A gondonla is a must 100 euro for 35 mins but you have to do it. We had a day on beach at Lido which was great after a sight seeing for two days and nights walking. 29 euro for 2 sunbeds and umberella but well worth it, there is a public beach (free) no beds.

The breakfast was fantastic - there was an actual breakfast buffet by American standards with eggs, sausage, doughnuts, croissants, etc. There was also a coffee and tea bar. The breakfast room is their restaurant in the evening and breakfast was included. And while we were there, there was a soccer match and one of the teams was staying in the hotel and having breakfast there! The hotel staff speaks English well and were very nice and helpful. The hotel is in a safe neighborhood of Sant'Elena, which is further down the Venice island, and is one of the neighborhoods in Venice where the locals live. It was nice and quiet at night and we slept very well. We rode the vaporetto up and down the Grand Canal and the Sant'Elena stop is just a few down from San Marco - it took us just minutes to get there by vaporetto. If you wanted to walk, there's a very nice walkway along the waterfront that goes through some pretty parks and takes about 15 to 20 minutes to walk to San Marco. It was not hard at all to get to the hotel from the train station on the vaporetto. The vaporetto takes you to the Sant'Elena stop and from there it is a 2 minute walk through a park. We bought vaporetto tickets that allowed us unlimited rides while we were there, which I recommend. The only drawback is if you have to go to the airport very early in the morning, you'll have to take a water taxi which is pricey (about 90 Euros) which we had to do since we left for the airport at 420am. It did come right to the side of the hotel though. If your plane leaves at a more reasonable hour, you can take public transportation or the Alilaguna which is also affordable. Staying at this hotel really allowed us to enjoy being in the hustle and bustle of Venice and yet feel like we were easily getting away from the commotion when we wanted to.

We loved it. We selected it based in part on reviews on this site and can agree with most of the positive points mentioned. It is some distance from St Mark's square - the 20-30mins mentioned in other reviews seems more realistic than the \"a few minutes\" on the hotel's own website - but then if you're a tourist staying in Venice you're going to be buying the vaporetto tourist ticket anyway (aren't you ?) so why not take advantage of boats every five minutes or so which take 10-12 minutes for the two or three stop trip. Some may quibble with the room decoration - if you are looking for quaint venetian charm then go elsewhere - but what you get here is nice, modern styled rooms with plenty of space and facilities that work. The pictures of the hotel on the Best Western website are representative of what we had in both rooms. Top marks for the air conditioning in our room, which was effective without being noisy and thus even a light sleeper like me could sleep with it left on - helped by the fact that the fan speed automatically reduced when the set temperature was reached. Room cleanliness on arrival was good, although we did feel that the servicing of the rooms during the days we were there was not as thorough as it could have been - cups were left dirty one morning, for example. Buffet style breakfast was good - plenty of cereals, breads, spreads, meats, fruit and fruit juice, etc. The scrambled egg and fried bacon were the only hot food and a bit of a let down, but that's consistent with other hotels in Italy. Reception were helpful in dealing with those queries we had and we found no problems with speaking English to any of the staff.

It is in a very quiet, residential area of Venice, but only about 15 mins walk to the centre, or 5 mins on the vaporetto. The rooms were spacious and clean - we had a junior suite (had booked via the hotel website for a special offer and had to pre-pay in full) with enormous bed, sofa, minibar, roomsafe, bathrobes and large bathroom with twin washbasins. The hotel was clean, the staff helpful, and the breakfasts fantastic - cereals, ham, cheese, bacon, eggs, yogurt, cake, doughnuts (!), rolls, croissants, juice, coffee, etc. Breakfast could be taken in the garden if you wanted. All in all we could not fault the hotel in any way, and would definitely stay there again. The only thing I would say is there is not much in the immediate area - a couple of small local shops and one cafe were all we could find. However, this is not a problem as it is so easy to get around, and the walk to the centre takes you through the local park and along the waterfront. Re travelling to and from the airport, if you are a largeish group, or have lots of money, a private water taxi is the most amazing way to arrive - the route takes you through the main canal of Murano, so you get to see some of the sights there, and stops on a small, quiet canal, just one minute's walk from the Sant Elena. Otherwise the best way is to take the Alilaguna service to the Lido (12 euros per person) and then it's just one stop on the water bus to Sant Elena. As we expected, Venice in August was very crowded, especially when the day trippers were there, and it was lovely to escape back to some peace and quiet at this hotel.

This is not a soulless chain, but a rather charming little haven. First off, it is in a quiet residential area, about a mile from San Marco. That might look remote on the map, but in fact it is a bonus, especially if you are staying for more than a day or so, as by then you will be desperate to escape the crowds. There is a vaporetto stop a minute's walk from the hotel, so you could be in San Marco in 10 minutes if you wanted to. Personally, we preferred the 20 minute stroll. We arrived around 10pm, but the hotel chef was happy to do dinner. All the staff were thoroughly professional (if rather reserved, which seems to be common enough in the Veneto), and spoke good English while being prepared to indulge bad Italian. The rooms are reasonably spacious and comfortable. My one gripe would be that the pillows appear to be made from cardboard and twist your neck into contorted positions. If staying there again I would consider taking an inflatable pillow, but it wouldn't put me off. Breakfast was far above the usual reconstituted orange and dubious crackers that you so often get on the continent. In fact, you could pleasantly waste most of the morning dining out on the terrace. All in all, I don't think I would bother looking at other hotels if staying in Venice again. Sant'Elena is pretty much perfect, and not a bad price for the city. One tip I would offer is to ignore the \"official\" way of getting from the airport to the hotel. The \"fast\" ferry, when it deigns to leave, takes over an hour to travel the couple of miles to Lido, before you get a no. 1 the single stop to Sant'Elena. And there's very little to see. It's quicker overall and cheaper to take a bus from outside the airport terminal to Piazzale Roma, and change to a vaporetto 41 / 51 / 61.

The Sant'Elena offers a beautiful sanctuary that is still in the city itself, but in a residential neighborhood that allows one to see a different, less touristy side of the city than usual. You'll never battle crowds here for anything. If you're like me, you will cherish the stroll through the Parco delle Rimembranze to get back to the hotel each night, rather than finding it a hassle. It is definitely a long stroll, but don't be deceived by some reviews... whoever took 45 minutes to walk to St. Mark's Square must have been walking blindfolded. It takes me 20 minutes at a normal pace, and it's an incredibly scenic walk. Via Garibaldi, which has some of my favorite places to eat in Venice, is an easy walk, less than 10 mins. With the amazing food in Venice, the exercise walking to and from the Sant'Elena one or more times per day is a huge plus for me. This hotel deserves its stars, as the quality of the rooms is excellent and the service very good. Breakfast is better than most Italian hotels, and the terrace dining area is sublime on cool fall mornings.

Unless we become millionares and trade up to the Cipriani, this is where we would return, without question.", "Date": "April 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "derbyshire, England", "Title": "\u201cnot as goodas expected\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4987862", "Content": "I went in a party of 2couples on an easter break, booking following good reviews on this web site. The location is someway from St Marks and this has pros and cons - the main pro being that it is quiet. The water bus service is excellent however and cheap if you buy the 3day pass, otherwise 5euros/trip. Rooms to us were average for 4star, small on storage. Breakfast was reasonable. In room coffee/milk supply was tight (1 sachet/day/room!) The bar shuts early and they will not serve residents when they have deemed it shut (we were turned away at 11pm and 11.55pm on 2days even tho staff were in the bar - we would have expected a normal 4 star service to serve us). I do not know how this compares with other Venice hotels, but suspect it might be the norm?. Staff were efficient and professional rather than helpful or friendly. We had not realised that it was a Best Western hotel, which might have swayed our decision towards staying more in the centre in another Best Western.", "Date": "April 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Essex, England", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel and location\u201d", "Author": "PECurt", "ReviewID": "UR4771731", "Content": "The hotel is in a good location, 200 metres from the Sant Elena waterbus stop, or a 15-20 minute walk from St Mark's Square.

The hotel is situated far from the madding crowds of central Venice in a residential area where \"real people\" live and go about their daily business but has easy access to the city centre via the vaporetto no.1 route which goes all the way up the Grand Canal. The stop is 2 minutes from the hotel. The hotel is spotlessly clean and freshly decorated with a minimalist,Japanese theme in black and silver.We had a standard bedroom of adequate size and a view of the courtyard garden, a canal and the bay of San Marco. The buffet breakfast is served in a bright, airy dining-room and has a good choice of food, including a hot option.The staff are welcoming and helpful. Best of all is the service at reception where the staff went out of their way to give advice and were so pleasant. Like a previous reviewer, we feel that it would have been perfect if we could have eaten a light meal in the restaurant in the evening before going back into the city. Finally, a bit of advice about the Alilaguna ferry service from Marco Polo airport. Contrary to the literature, the courtesy bus to the boat stop was not operating and the albeit short walk carrying luggage could be a problem for elderly or infirm passengers.Also, you don't have to travel on the ferry to San Marco to get the vaporetto to Sant' Elena. You can get off at Lido and transfer to vaporetto there. Sant' Elena is the next stop.", "Date": "March 28, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "BEST WESTERN Premier Hotel Sant' Elena", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d1086740-Reviews-BEST_WESTERN_Premier_Hotel_Sant_Elena-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$162 - $384*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Calle Buccari 10</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">30132</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Venice</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1086740", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/a3/f3/a3f38878bc8eb4e8d9471a17bdf016a55large.jpg"}}
