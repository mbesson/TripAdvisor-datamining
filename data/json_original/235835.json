This little place was perfect! Getting to the hotel isn't all that easy, but getting to any hotel in Venice isn't easy unless you are staying by a transportation hub (train station, vapparetta station, etc.), as there are no cars/taxis/buses on the Venetian island. From the airport, we took a bus to the island, then got off, walked a bit to the closest vapparetta station, took a vapparetta to the Rialto bridge, and from there is was a walk of about ten minutes to the Hotel Serenissima. It seemed to take forever to get there because we had just gotten off an international flight, were tired, cranky, hungry, and wanted to brush our teeth. ;-> When we did make it to the hotel, we were warmly greeted by the front desk clerk, a lovely young woman, who took our suitcases and let us use the upstairs hall bathroom, even though our rooms wouldn't be ready for several hours. We were able to leave our bags, freshen up, and begin our wonderful adventure in Venice. The hotel was a gem! After we got over the initial shock of how long it took to get there (and again, probably the jet lag talking), we realized it was in a central location, a couple of blocks from St. Mark's Square and the Rialto Bridge. There is also a gondola station around the corner, as well as a small opera house and the typical small squares around the city. Pefect location if you factor out the time it takes to get there, or to leave and get back to the airport. The rooms were quite functional. The room my travel partner and I stayed in was a \"double,\" meaning we had two twin beds, a wardrobe, and a decent sized bathroom. It was located on the second floor, overlooking a small, quiet square out back of the hotel. It was quite lovely to see all the flowers, and watch the owner's golden retriever, Sleepy, play out back. We also had a beautiful Murano glass chandelier in our room, and I think every room had a different chandelier. They were quite lovely! Breakfast was included with our stay, not sure if this was because we were part of the Rick Steve's tour, or if this is something that would be extra if you're not part of a tour group. It wasn't anything fancy, just pastry, yogurt, fruit, juice, and coffee. The perfect breakfast if you plan to be out all morning, taking in the sites. There is no laundry facility here, so if you plan to stay for a few days, either take enough clothes for your entire stay, or head out to the nearest laundrymat, which was a fair little walk away. The bathroom in our room was very functional. It had a bathtub, bidet (which was new to me!!), a sink, and regular toilet. One thing I would always recommend, and it's not just because of our stay in this hotel, is that you take your own soap with you on a trip to Europe, and maybe even your own towell. Towels are skimpy and the bars of soap are tiny. The hotel is located on a charming side street close to everything. Oh, I forgot to mention that there is a Burger King right around the corner if you miss your American food. Believe it or not, there were quite a few people eating there, although I don't understand why you would want to. I would highly recommend this hotel for a stay in Venice. You could certainly stay in one of the \"chain\" hotels, but they aren't located on the island, and since the transportation closes down in the evening, you would totally miss out on St. Mark's Square and gondola ride at night. I plan to take my husband to Venice some day, and this is definitely the place we will stay. Great location, friendly owners, clean, affordable. What's not to love??!!!", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vlissingen, Zeeland", "Title": "\u201ccharming little hotel, perfect location\u201d", "Author": "Siesje", "ReviewID": "UR125026790", "Content": "stayed here for two nights 3 years ago and we have lovely memories of the hotel, the super location and the wonderful magic town of Venice.

I have a terrible sense of direction and had trouble with getting the right exit out of San Marco Square. I hope this will help others as it is simple and quick if you get it right! Look to the right of the banners for the Correr Museum. Opposite end to the Basilica etc. The number above one of the shops at the exit you need is 88 and one is called Markus. The exit is marked Per Rialto. There is one bridge to cross and when you get near a 4* hotel and Georgio Armani you will see the sign and the red flag outside the hotel. I was never asked to see my ticket on the ATCV water bus but they were very keen on the Alilaguna from the airport and back. They only take cash at the ticket office at the airport for the alilaguna trip into Venice (12 euro) and if you buy a 2 day (26 euro) etc ATCV water bus ticket there. I got a ticket from the Doges Palace which included the museum there and others at the Correr Museum. They tell you it is good for 3 months but they don't tell you that you cannot re-enter. So I wanted to go back into the Palace as I missed the museum there but you can't go back in! however the cafe at the Correr is great value (if that isn't a contradiction in terms in Venice) as you can sit and look out at the Sq to the Basilica, Doges Palace and Campanile and have a coffee for 2.5 euros. Compare that to 7 euros in Florian where you don't have the same view at all. But was the 13 euros in florian worth it for the iced coffee I had? Oh yes! The weather in early March was very cold and a drizzle of rain everyday. I had a bad cold too but went to a Pharmacy and got some great tablets to stop my nose running so don't let anything spoil your trip. I did find the overload of religious art and over elaborate explanations of the governing system too much on the audio guides. Then the Peggy Guggenheim home was a complete contrast in the opposite direction of Pollock etc. But I embraced it all.", "Date": "March 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rio de Janeiro", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "brazilianwanderlust", "ReviewID": "UR14055410", "Content": "Italy is always a difficult place for hotels, and Venice is a city where you have to be extra-careful.

I remember seeing a framed letter signed by some german writer or actor praising the hotel for its good services back in the seventies or so. But it is not a bad hotel.

The room was slightly bigger than we had anticipated, after reading some of the previous reviews. If you find that your air cond is not working,just check with reception, because ours had been turned off. It is very stuffy without it. The breakfast was the most basic we have ever had on a holiday, and whatever you do , dont order tea at breakfast. The minute we arrived at the airport , we were parted from nearly 80 euros for public transport and bus passes. This proved to be the way it was for the whole break . Dont be under the illusion that you can do this trip on the cheap,because you cant. We paid generally 10 euros for 2 small beers, and in one restaurant ( AL BURCHIELLO) we paid 50 euros for 2 plain pizzas and 2 beers. The beers were 9 euros each and they took 12% and 5 euros service charges on top. Scandalous! The biggest dissapointment was the attitude of the people that we encountered, working in Venice ie. waiters etc . Niceties and good manners do not exist. We appreciate that a lot of the big cities are this way, but we found Venice to be in a class of its own. We did visit the Lido, ( 15 mins on the water bus ) and we found it a great relief from the hustle bustle of the main areas. I think that we would agree with some of the previous reviews, in that in the future we would stop there , away from the madding crowd. Venice is a place unlike anywhere else, and everyone should visit once. It has great places of historical interest with fabulous churches and palaces.

Venice is an experience - a definite must on any travellers wish list.

Venice is extremely safe, I was in Florence and Rome aswell and definitely felt most at ease in Venice.

Make sure you go to San Giorgio and for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3 you can get a lift to the top of the campanile - the views are amazing!

I asked if they had anything to help get rid of the mozzies and was advised just to keep the window shut. Basically I had a choice then -fresh air of mozzie bites. The mozzies, plus the toilet noises meant I had quite a few sleepless nights and I stayed for a week here so this was a problem. There were a couple of other issues - I don't think my sheets were changed during the whole 6 days. The cleaners came in twice when I had the 'do not disturb' sign out.
