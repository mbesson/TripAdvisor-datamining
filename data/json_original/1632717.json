He was very friendly and welcoming. The former boutique hotel was in a convenient location in the city. Just a few minutes walk from the train station and city highlights. The tiny lift for the luggage was quite awkward to load/unload. The room at first glance was cozy but as we stayed there for several nights, we made a list of things that weren't so cozy. It got unbearably stuffy at night. With the window open, the traffic noise kept us awake. Even small things like a curtain that we didn't have to struggle with every night, or a bathroom floor towel/mat would have made our stay a bit more tolerable. The live band/chaos from the bar below surprisingly didn't keep us up like other people have mentioned. Somehow it isolated the noise. But have to say overall, it had an interesting unique charm.", "Date": "February 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Wollongong", "Title": "\u201cYay for great staff\u201d", "Author": "Shane M", "ReviewID": "UR123468948", "Content": "Rooms was simple bit clean.

When we complained to management, they told us that the band was supposed to stop at 8:00 p.m. The band never did stop until at least midnight. There is no hotel management onsite in the evening or overnight, so they could not do anything about the band during sleeping hours.

They make the hotel out to be old and charming, but in reality there is no charm, just oldness. We ordered a superior double room, but the room was small and cramped, and you could hear the hallway door slamming everytime someone opened it. The reception desk is right outside rooms #1 and #2, so I feel sorry for people coming out of those rooms and having the receptionists stare at them as they enter and exit their rooms! Talk about lack of privacy! The free breakfast is not some smorgasboard of fruit, bread, pancackes, juice, coffee etc as advertised in outdated sites online... it is a choice of ONE beverage and ONE choice of toast OR *tiny* pancakes, obtained from the cafe across the street! The only good thing about this place is the location: 5 mins walk from the Museum train station, and around the corner from Oxford St. If you are desperate and this is the only hotel you can get, then avoid rooms 1-6, and 21-23, as those rooms overlook Wentworth Ave., which is the noisiest side of the building.

Got no sleep all night, were offered only a \"sorry, there was a function on\" apology. The room wasn't cleaned very well, we found a used empty beer bottle under the chair and my 2 year old found a piece of unwrapped candy on the floor which she of course tried to eat. There was mold in the bathroom, as well as little bugs all over the shower curtain. The lift required a key to operate, but reception is on the second level, so couldn't exactly go up there leaving the pram with my daughter in it to get the key and had to lug the pram up too many flights of stairs. When we got up there, a film crew was filming some sort of ameteur film in the halls and we had to interrupt them every time we left our room or came back. We only booked the hotel so my husband didn't have to get up at some ridiculous hour to get to Hyde Park to run in a half marathon in the morning. Instead, we were up all night and then he had to run half asleep. The walls are paper thin and you can hear everything outside your door as if there is only a curtain separating you and them. The doors have a really annoying alarm when you hold down the handle as you open them, pretty much waking everyone in the place whenever someone opens their door. I definitely would not recommend this hotel to anyone. I've stayed at places half the price that were far far better. Also, the window in the bathroom was just below waist level, and opened all the way up, with no screen or bars, a death trap for kids who could easily fall or climb right out (the bathroom door is only a sliding door with no lock, kids can easily open it).", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood value\u201d", "Author": "GirlOnHolilday", "ReviewID": "UR104004959", "Content": "The Econo Lodge is a great budget hotel in a good location, just a short walk from George Street and the main shopping centers.

The restaurant seemed to have original Victorian furniture. The young woman at reception sometimes seemed 'put out' by being disturbed with a question, but the man was most helpful. Great location, at a reasonable price, which trumped any complaints. Bar below, while busy, never disturbed us. (Food there average. Staff there great).
