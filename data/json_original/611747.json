We were there just by chance because of a layover with Turkish Air and decided to make an overnight stay of it. We are so glad we did! Since we were there for such a short time we decided to seek the help of a tour company so that we could see as much of the city as possible. On the recommendation of friends and some internet research we found Backpackers Travel in Sultanahmet-Istanbul. They picked us up at the airport early in the morning, checked our luggage and off we went with our fabulous guide for a whirlwind tour of the city. We started our day with a Turkish coffee in a local cafe, which was a welcome way to start after the 10 hour flight from New York City. Our tour guide spoke flawless English and was obviously very proud of his city and quite knowledgeable of its history. He showed us the Hagia Sofia, the Blue Mosque and the Cistern. We enjoyed a nice kebap lunch, which was included in our tour. We also toured the grand bazaar. My husband was interested in purchasing some carpets so our guide took us to a reputable dealer where we made a purchase after some exciting bargaining over more Turkish coffee. The rugs we purchased were shipped to us. We might have been nervous about such a purchase in a foreign country but felt assured by our guide and are happy to report that the same rugs arrived just one month after our purchase in fine condition. We took the tram to the waterfront where we had hoped to end the day with a cruise but the last ferry had been cancelled so instead we toured the spice market and walked across the bridge for the at sunset before returning back to our hotel. Our stay at Deniz House was quite pleasant. We were more than pleased with the value of the stay for the price we paid. The room was comfortable and clean. The view was lovely. Travelers should be prepared for lots of stairs and shorter door frames and small showers due to the age of the building but we found this all part of the charm of the building and the area. For me the best part of our stay was the beautiful continental breakfast. It was a delightful spread of fruits, olives, breads, boiled eggs, fresh cucumbers and tomatoes as well as a couple of hot dishes that included a delicious potato gratin. The breakfast room is on the top floor of the hotel and has a small terrace which is a great place to take in some coffee while watching the neighborhood wake up. Because of the wonderful information and advise from our tour guide the day before we were able to comfortably explore the city on our own the next day. We enjoyed Topkapi palace and the Museum of Turkish and Islamic Art before leaving that evening for the airport.

To summarize: Location is excellent -- a pleasant 5 min walk uphill to the Blue Mosque and Hippodrome, yet removed and secluded both from the crowds and bustle of the tourists in Sultanahmet and from the commerce closer to the Grand Bazaar/Beyazit area. Airport transfers were very efficient in large, comfortable vehicles. Staff are very friendly and helpful -- this is the kind of place that is small enough to be personal and warm, and they really do care about you. But is also large enough that they have certain standards and scale economies with the service delivery and sister properties (basically a few small hotels in the vicinity). Rooms were small-ish but comfortable and cosy. We got upgraded to a sea view room, which had great views and a cute balcony. Others have mentioned the noise from passing trains, the tracks are right below. We were not bothered by the noise, the trains don't run from midnight to 6am. There are good quality double glazed windows and the balcony door, to help reduce the noise. But anyone who thinks that this might bother them should probably request a room that does not face the tracks -- the new building, and those rooms in the old building facing the street, would be fine. Heating was more than adequate, we found it too warm despite turning off the radiator, and had the window open a crack. Bathroom was clean and hot water in the shower was great. Bedroom slippers and a small fruit/snack plate over the fridge were nice touches. We found the bed itself a bit hard, and the pillows flat, but slept just fine. Wifi is available throughout, but did not work well from room, they have to sort out one of the routers. Otherwise it worked fine from the terrace area, and also at reception. The old building has the charm of wood and rugs etc. -- we liked that a lot. Breakfast was a very large buffet spread served on the terrace level with great views. The spread was large, and Turkish in character: breads, eggs, honey and jams, olives, cheeses, fruit. Also a hot section with sausages, potatoes, etc. Coffee and tea and some snacks are available all day here also, as is water from water dispenser here and at the reception.

This ticked the boxes. Location very good - 5 mins walk (uphill, not too steep) to the Blue Mosque. Staff friendly, efficient and helpful (although recommendations didn't go beyond the usual tourist places) and the airport pickup they organised for us was good. The hotel is split over 2 buildings and I think which one you end up in will make a difference to how much you enjoy your stay. Essentially the main (original) building where reception is has nicer and more characterful rooms but is the one that is nearer the train tracks. My boyfriend and I paid a little extra from the standard room price for a \"garden\" room. We ended up in the main building, on the ground floor with a little outdoor private terrace with table and chairs and a swinging \"love seat\"! Although not high up you could still look over the fence/look from the room window and watch the ships on the sea of marmara. The higher up balcony/sea view rooms were above us and do have a good view - there are better views in istanbul, but all in all the view is lovely. Our room was spacious and light and very nicely decorated with nice dark wood furniture and nice and recent decor, although the shower wasn't very powerful. The train track runs past this building and particularly right outside the \"garden\" rooms. We didn't have any problems with this - although the trains are loud and we did notice them during the day, they aren't particularly frequent and did stop at a certain time so we slept fine. All in all, very impressed and very happy for the price we paid. My friends who paid the standard room price all ended up in the other building. The rooms are fine there, just not quite as nice/a bit more basic. The decor and linen were not as pretty and the rooms were slightly smaller. However, still a good budget option and no complaints. Two friends with a twin ended up in the triple/quad room in the basement which was a very big room but had no windows and was therefore a bit dingy. On the plus side, the showers in the other building are excellent. Breakfast is served on the roof terrace of both buildings (you can choose, each has its plus points on view) and is reasonably basic but fine.

(they were in fact not, but he did not bother to call to check), The third staff member did not help, nor make a phone call - but gave me the address of their travel agency and told me to walk there.

Cold and very business oriented. The worse is that they switch guests around different hotels to fill the capacity. Smart idea, but think about when you are exhausted from a long flight, after walking around all the narrow and dusty streets finally you saw the sign of the hotel on your reservation email. You walked in, but the guy at the reception told you \"we are full. You have to go to another one which is our sister hotel.\" This was what exactly happened to me. Actually even worse. I stayed in Istanbul for three days and then took a tour to Cappadocia and came back to Istanbul to fly back to the US. The day before I left Istanbul to Cappadocia , since I knew I'll have a late arrival when I came back, I walked to the hotel to get myself familiar with the location. When I tried to confirm my reservation with the guy sitting at the reception desk, he told me my reservation was with The Naz Wooden House. I showed him my email confirmation from Deniz House but he insisted that in the system my reservation was with the other hotel. I gave up and walked back to the Naz Wooden House and confirmed my reservation and also booked the airport transfer from them. But at the night when I came back from Cappadocia, when the driver dropped me at the Naz Wooden House, the reception told me \"We are full.\" It was almost middle night and I was already exhausted. After the very unpleasant discussion with the reception and the guy at the reservation, both of them were very rude and stubborn, I completely lost my energy.

It's a short walk to the main attractions, such as the Blue Mosque, the Hippodrome, Aya Sofya, etc. At night there's not very much to do around Sultanahmet, however, and prices for food and drinks are inflated. I would recommend the Taksim area if you'd rather be closer to a more bustling, hip and busy part of town. Deniz Hotel has two buildings, and I stayed in the 'B' building. I don't think there's a difference in quality, and the 'B' building is a couple doors down from the main one. The rooftop terrace is a bit small, but has good views. Breakfast was simple, but adequate. The room was clean, comfortable and relatively roomy. The front door and door to the bathroom were a little hard to close and get locked. I had to put a lot of my weight into it just to get the door locked. The shower stall in the leaked water like crazy onto the bathroom floor, but was otherwise clean. The walls are a little thin, but not as bad as other reviewers have suggested. You could definitely hear some noise, especially from cleaning crew in hallway, but not so much from other rooms. Overall it was a great place to stay. Definitely take a map and a business card from this place the first night or so, because it's easy to get lost.

It's a leisurely 10-minute walk (up) to the Blue Mosque (and to the nearest tram stop). But it's also far more quiet than being 50 meters from a mosque with calls-to-prayer starting around 0500 and large rumbling tourist buses in the streets. (You can still walk almost everywhere in the old district and grab a tram to go north to the ferries and across the Golden Horn if you wish. In other words, you can avoid the taxis which almost always will over-charge you.) If you're clear this property is part of a class of \"special class hotels\" in Istanbul (many converted from 19th century \"town houses\") and not at all like a typical, big \"corporate\" hotel, then you can view it for what it is: a small (only about 14 rooms) hotel, with some nice modern touches (flat-screen TV), air conditioning (that, unlike many hotels, you can leave on at a moderate temp while you're gone), a mini-refrigerator, comfortable beds, and small but modern bathrooms. So you get a safe, small, Spartan room, with a spotless, tiled bath at a good price. You won't get certain things you might miss: a folding stand for luggage, etc. (but you will get a brand new pair of slippers and a first-aid kit). You can see a room on this website page: http://www.turkeytravelplanner.com/go/Istanbul/hotels/districts/kayasofya/deniz_konak.html Look closely at the two room photos. You can see virtually all the furnishings including the small vanity/mini-desk. (By the way, http://www.turkeytravelplanner.com is an excellent resource for Istanbul.) If you have your choice of rooms, I'd get one on the front of the building vs. the rear. And if you travel \"heavy,\" you need to know there are no lifts and no bell staff to help with bags. Breakfast, on the top floor with views of both of the Sea of Marmara and the Blue Mosque, is in the style of most Istanbul hotels -- sliced meats and cheeses, fresh vegetables, yoghurt and toppings, four or five types of bread and rolls and beverages -- fresh and good and more than enough to get you through mid-day. Free internet is available in the lobby and on the terrace level but not in most rooms. Note: When I was there, only the manager, the charming Kerem Benligil, spoke English. Perhaps because of language issues, the staff tend to mirror what they see. If you're warm and gracious, they'll be. If you're not, they may be more reserved. (That seemed to be true in many places in Istanbul. Learn at least a few Turkish words and the place will seem much friendlier.) Deniz Houses (plural) includes a second building about ten meters away that appears to be newer, but I didn't check it out although I could see its views are different -- probably not quite as good.

It was within our rather modest budget and the other reviews in Trip Advisor seemed good enough for us. We arrived on a Saturday afternoon having taken advantage of the hotel's offer of transport from Ataturk airport for 20 euros. At reception we were told that our room wasn't available until the next day but that they would take us to one of their other hotels. That didn't bother us and it was only 5 minutes away. It was called the Tashkonak and seemed fine to us, though we did have a room on the ground floor which was very noisy at night. The Deniz Konak hotel is a small hotel with less than 20 rooms, it is also a small building and tall people might have to mind their heads a bit. In fact neither my wife or myself could acually stand up in the shower as there was a large beam in the way. Our room was very nice, clean and had a view of the Sea of Marmara. One drawback of a sea view is that there is a railway right in front of the hotel and the Sea is incredibly busy and the large boats drone their way up and down all day and night. There is double glazing but not much use if you sleep with a window open. Breakfast is served on the top floor where there is a good variety of cereals, yoghurt, cheese, meats etc. plus tea and coffee. One of the things that we really liked about the hotel was the fact that this room was open from the afternoon until late at night and you could make yourself teas and coffees as much as you liked. The hotel is in the old part of Istanbul and only 10 minutes from Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque. We enjoyed our stay at this hotel but there was a slightly annoying thing at the end. We had to pay for our airport transfers and a taxi ride that we had got the hotel to organise. As it was at thye end of our holiday we had very little Turkish money left so had to pay by card. The hotel really wanted us to pay in cash and added a large charge for paying by card. This really annoyed me but didn't feel like arguing the point, but you end up leaving on a slightly sour note.

I stayed in Room 1 and my friend in Room 2 and both had their own gardens, with swinging chairs and tables and plants etc --- I'd imagine these would be amazing in the summer when the city would be very hot --- and you could see out on to the Bosphorus, with the ships queueing up for the port/docks. The tram passes quite close to the hotel, so it's a bit noisy if you keep the windows open, but I'd prefer to have a tram nearby and put up with any noise than to be miles away. The hotel is very close to Hagia Sofia and the Blue Mosque and the Hippodrome and many of the main tourist attractions, and there are many restaurants and caf\u00c3\u00a9s and even pubs nearby. I loved having breakfast (buffet with boiled eggs, sliced cheeses, olives, cucumber, sausages, potatoes in cream, bread, dried fruits etc etc -- and horrid horrid coffee, but there is Nescaf\u00c3\u00a9 in a jar... even though I hate Nescaf\u00c3\u00a9 it was way better than the other) on the terrace within sight of the Blue Mosque and listening to the call to prayer. The staff is really helpful and friendly. The hotel offers a collection from the airport and, while it is more expensive than the many offers you see on the streets in the vicinity, I'd happily pay more when I don't have to lug my suitcase around the uneven streets to the other choices. I felt the service provided was so efficient and so pleasant that I didn't mind in the least paying more than the competition was offering on the streets --- who knows what service these places were providing? I think the beds/mattresses were very uncomfortable, but this may be because I've had a spinal injury and find it difficult to get a comfortable bed. The staff was again very helpful and tried to make things easier by giving me extra pillows etc. I would suggest that the broom cupboard or store-room for the cleaning staff be moved away from the ground-floor bedrooms as there was quite a lot of banging and clattering while staff moved buckets and brooms etc at very early hours of the morning.

The hotel is not sparkling brand new but the beds were clean; double glazed windows kept the noise to a minimum; the aircon worked; and there was lots of hot water (they immediately worked on the leak from the shower so hopefully, this will not be a problem).

Both rooms open to an adjoining garden. THe rooms would do nicely for twin occupancy but it was tight for three persons. We moved things around to get little more room for our luggages. The staff were friendly and accomodating-- the manager, Keram, even helped ordered a turkish dinner to be delivered to our room when we were too tired to go out. Breakfast was served on the top floor (4 flights up-- no elevators) and adequate: boiled eggs, sausages, cream potatoes, two types of bread, assortment of teas, coffee, juice, yoghurt, hotel, several jams, apples & grapes, cereals & dried fruits, some cookies and two types of cakes. Drinking water was always available-- a water dispenser could be found at the entrance. There is a taxi stand close by and several restaurants/cafes could be reached in 10-15 mins walk. There is a small grocery close by for some quick purchases. There are a lot of small side streets and it can be so easy to get lost. What is important is to always have the hotel staff write the name and directions of the hotel in Turkish to show when asking for directions back.

The hotel scores highly for the quiet side-street location (with a handy taxi rank 20m away), close to the Blue Mosque. I was given a double room which, while fine for one, struck me as too small for a couple. With a double bed in place there was no room for so much as a chair in the rest of the room. The hotel is in an old wooden house, so I guess they can't do much about the size of the rooms. The decor was slightly bizarre, with a very rough oatmeal colured concrete over the walls and ceiling with dark flecks in it; it was a bit like sleeping in a bowl of porridge. They also lost big points from me because of the poly-cotton sheets. I can't remember he last time I had to put up with those. Apart from the sheets I had a pleasant stay, though I would probably spend a bit more for a slightly higher standard of comfort if I visit Istanbul again. Staff were friendly and welcoming, and emails and the car transfer from the airport were perfectly managed. The breakfast terrace overlooking the Mosque is terrific (though the breakfast itself was fairly poor).", "Date": "June 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cGood place to stay\u201d", "Author": "CitizenGirl_57", "ReviewID": "UR32418890", "Content": "We wanted to stay at its sister hotel, the Sultan's Inn, but our travel agent booked us at the Deniz instead because the Sultan's Inn was booked that night.

Whilst our double room in the Deniz Konak was basic, it had an excellent sea view from the balcony and clean bathroom (although to bath was quite small and was only really practical for a shower). Also the bed was perhaps a little hard, yet this did not make our stay unbearable. The reception staff were always extremely welcoming, and did whatever they could to make sure our stay as comfortable and to recommend activities for us in the day. But the greatest thing about the Deniz Konak was the location. A 5-minute walk would bring you to the centre of the historic quarter, to the Blue Mosque and Sultanahmet Square. However, with this ideal location comes the unwelcome fact that the hotel is situated next to the (rather noisy) railway line. Yet on the whole, I would recommend the Deniz Konak simply on the basis that it is brilliant value for money. I especially recommend it for tourists planning to spend a long-weekend city break in Istanbul, people who will plan to spend most of the day out in the city and a comfortable base for the night. 4*", "Date": "February 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh", "Title": "\u201cTwo thumbs up!

It is a small hotel(15 rooms), pleasant and relaxed which gave me the opportunity to talk with people (staff and guests) that a large hotel would not. A possible drawback for some is the lack of an elevator. However, with someone to carry my luggage, even I, tho over 65 didn't mind climbing a flight or two of stairs.
