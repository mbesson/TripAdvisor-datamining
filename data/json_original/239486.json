More, in the confirmation email was written \"attention: prepaid reservation, not refundable. No cancellation or modification will be possible\". Later I gave a look to the reviews here on Tripadvisor and read about that a lot of angry people that were moved to other hotels with various excuses, so I told my wife: \"bet we'll be moved somewhere else...\". I got it! In fact, we arrived to Hotel Marconi after having walked a lot with our bag (fortunately it was a wonderful sunny day) and the girl at the reception, after having copied our documents and my credit card (as a guarantee for the minibar!!!) told us that there was a problem with the room because the person that was occupying it had an health problem during the night (this is indeed an excellent, disarming excuse) so we were had to go to the Hotel San Mois\u00c3\u00a8, walking for another 15 minutes from Rialto to San Marco. Given some reviews that I have read about the Marconi, probably we were rather lucky because the room at the San Mois\u00c3\u00a8 was not bad and breakfast was also good, but folks...DO EXPECT TO BE MOVED EVEN IF YOU RESERVED 3 MONTHS IN ADVANCE. Note that they also tend to fool you because the girl said the we had chosen the roulette formula, so we could expect to be moved.Obviously we put in front of her nose the reservation number below the symbol of the Marconi Hotel. Later we found that two brothers owe these 4 and other 3 hotels in venice (see \"www.hotelsinvenice.com\") .

It appears that the hotel has had no renovations forever, and smells horribly of mildew. The carpet is old, and you can see aging cans of coke and other sodas all over the lobby. Anyway, thats not the real reason why we had a terrible experience. We were a group of 4 senior couples visiting Italy and Venice specifically for 3 nights. Our reservation clearly stated \"handicap accessible rooms preferred\". I understand that is not a guarantee, but the hotel didnt have the courtesy of advising us that not only dont they have handicapped accessible rooms, but they even DONT have an elevator. What annoyed us, that NO where on any travel website or the hotel website they mention that. If that wasnt enough, I should have paid heed to several warnings in tripadvisor of their bait and switch scam. They wanted to move 2 of the couples in our party to their sister property (some 10 minutes away) on the excuse of some technical issues on the first floor. It keeps getting worse. When we refused to move to the sister property, their manager had the audacity to tell us to take their offer or find another hotel! Having no choice we decided to call our travel agent to find out the room rates of their sister property. At that time, that property was at least 50 euros less than this one. And here's where our nightmare really began. We thought that it was only fair that the hotel then refund us the difference. The manager denied the refund saying that we got a super saver deal which was very low to begin with. However, when we decided to remain adamant on our demands, he told us \"that he has no room in the hotel for disrespectful old people\" and CANCELLED our entire reservation. In all honestlly we panicked, and requested him that we dont care for the discount, but need the rooms. The manager showed no courtesy, and told us to go away! We were really shocked having a lot of luggage not knowing where to find a room in Venice at last minute. God bless our travel agent, who made arrangements for us at the last minute, and we were fortunate that we arrived in the late afternoon when US had just opened allowing us to reach our travel agent.

If you've been to Venice, you know how many stairs you need to go up and down just to get anywhere. When we got to the other hotel we asked for a refund as this was not the hotel we booked for. I've never met someone who was so rude. The lady told us point blank that there was no way they would give us a refund as this was the same hotel. I don't know if they thought we were stupid or what - clearly it was not the same hotel - it was 15 minutes away and had a different name!!! The rooms themselves were terrible. The bathroom was like a public bathroom with chipped tiles, a broken lock, etc. What was also strange was that when we would leave the hotel, they would ask us for our key back.

I actually booked a \"Superior Double\" direct with the hotel in hopes that we would get a room with a Grand Canal view. After all, if we were going to the middle of the beehive, why not witness it from the comfort of our own room. But be advised - the hotel only has two rooms with canal views, and one is a room for four people, so if you have your hopes sent on a canal view....think again. We were put in a dark alley view room with a small window, but asked for a room with more light and we were moved to room 202 with a small step out with more light. The rooms are varied in size from what we can tell but clean with functional bathrooms. The staff is present and helpful and the breakfast was hearty (don't show up too late - they tend to run out of the best stuff). Our bottom line: If you don't expect a view window and want to stay RIGHT THERE - this is a hotel you should look at. We'll have fond memories of the Marconi for years to come, but when we go back, we'll be looking for something outside the San Marco-Rialto roller derby with more space and a bit more light. Some more bits: We took a water taxi from the Marconi directly to the port to catch a cruise. It was the best 80 Euros we ever spent. Great ride and the cruise folks take your bags right from the water taxi. Do it if you are taking a cruise. And get up early if you stay in Venice! The best time is before 10:00AM.

Only book this location if you are booking a room with a view. There are plenty of other hotels in Venice with no-view rooms that have even better locations and much kinder service.

This happened to us and from reading other reviews I see that it appears to be their standard practice, no matter what random excuse they give you. It did ruin our first night and next morning in Venice. This was a place I waited so long to see and it was extremely dissapointing to spend our time shuffling around luggage, unpacking and re-packing and waiting in lobbies when we only had 2 full days/3 nights to stay in Venice. We were exhausted when we arrived and they made us trek 10 minutes on foot accross Venice toting our own luggage up and down stairs in a confusing maze down small allys with barking dogs and dog poop. There was one employee (who would not wait for us) that carried a small amount of our luggage. No appology was made. Nothing was offered to make up for the inconvenience (water taxi transfer, welcome drink, etc). We were treated as if we had inconvenienced THEM, even though they were happy to take our money when we booked our room in advance. We booked our hotel for the location, and we felt very ripped off when they made us move 10 minutes away. I'm not even sure if what they did was legal, since we had already paid. At the other hotel, they had us climb 3 flights of very steep stairs to get to our room. The view was terrible, but the room there was nice. The next morning we had to re-pack and wait for our other room to be ready rather than going out to St Marks Square before the crowds, as we had planned. This was very frustrating. They said we could just leave our luggage in the lobby until the room at the other hotel was ready. We had a computer with us and did not want to just leave it in the lobby or carry it around all day. Plus we had other valuables that we needed to lock in a safe and not carry around in crowded places. Our room at the Marconi was very small, nothing special, the pillows were hard and the noise outside in the ally was loud, but we booked the hotel for the Rialto location. The hotel unfortunately smelled of sewer. The breakfast was probably their best feature. Their customer service was their worst feature. I would never stay at their other hotels either. Their other hotel lied to us and told us they had talked to the Marconi and that they would upgrade our room at the Marconi (after we made a huge complaint), but the Marconi still put us in the same room that they had told us we would have when we arrived. The breakfast was good, but when I walked into the Marconi breakfast room after our second night, it was empty and it looked like they were closing down. The employee said it was closed and when I asked what time it closed at, he said 10:30, but it was only 10:00. We never felt welcome at this hotel during our stay. I felt like the employees hated their jobs and hated the guests. If we had not pre-paid we would have left. We took a look at other hotels closer to St Marks Square and there were PLENTY of open rooms with far better rates and some even had balconies, elevators and views! It may depend on the time of year, but I saw other people walking into hotels and getting rooms on the spot. Once we finished upacking AGAIN and got out to see Venice it was wonderful. So, please don't let this hotel ruin any of your time in Venice! If you have already pre-paid for this hotel, I suggest sending in one member of your party to check and see if there are any available rooms for the night. Find out if the room level that you paid for is available and maybe one with a view. Thank them and leave. After you know what is available, send in your other member several minutes later with the pre-paid reservation, so they can correct the manager if the hotel tells you they have to move you for the night.", "Date": "September 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, TX", "Title": "\u201cloved it!\u201d", "Author": "lizzard66", "ReviewID": "UR44382179", "Content": "What a treasure!

The staff easily transitioned from speaking Italian to English to German to French and were knowledgeable and friendly. The hotel was also very small and quaint and they got to know you. They offered free internet when we got there, but changed their service during our stay and started charging 6 EUR/hr. I cannot emphasize this enough with all of the different options in Venice, you can NOT FIND A BETTER LOCATION. The hotel is right on the Rialto Bridge (one of the major attractions in Venice). It is surrounded with great restaurants and shopping for all ages. Most importantly, the hotel is a fifteen minute walk or less from any major attraction on the island. I originally wanted to book a hotel closer to the train station and would have ended up kicking myself if I did. If you don't book the Hotel Marconi, look for another hotel located near the center of the island. Our room was the biggest drawback. We were so disappointed with the room itself that it almost ruined all of the other wonderful things about the hotel. While the bathroom was well equipped and decent sized, the room itself was tiny, even by European standards. The bed was flush against the right and back walls, with about 1 foot of space between it and the left wall. There was about an additional 4 feet of space between the bed and the far wall. Hardly enough space to open the door. Both the bedroom and bathroom window opened up into a tiny enclosed breezeway which went down the center of the building and opened up to the sky. It was about 6 feet wide and 5 feet across, looking only at other windows of the hotel (mostly windows for the hallways). We quickly got over the tiny size, but the room had an overwhelming odor of sewer gas. With the windows open, the scent would come and go throughout the day. With the windows closed, it would build up and become unbearable. Also, the bed was stiff enough that neither of us got a good night sleep in our seven night stay and my back hurt more and more each day. I caught glimpses of various other rooms and they all appeared larger and better equipped. The majority of the rooms appeared to have either a view of the Grand Canal or a street view.

A step outside the hotel front door and you're faced with the Rialto Bridge and just a short walk away from St Mark's Square which is ideal if you plan to see a lot of Venice on foot. The breakfast at the hotel was very nice and had a good selection of hot food and cereals, pastries and yoghurts. A tip for the gondolas - when we apporached a Gondola station we were told that it would cost us 150 euros for 40 minutes for just the two of us. However, we did manage to barter the guy down to 80 euros for 40 minutes and exclusive use of the gondola so don't accept the first price that they quote!

They informed us that the double rooms were small, however we didn't realize how small until they opened the door to mine(which was at the other end of the hall from my husbands) and hit the bed with the door at the 1/2 way point. About the only thing that fit in the room was the bed. There may have been 24 inches between the bed and the walls. I could barely get my toiletrie bag thru the opening into the bathroom.

Take a private water taxi to the hotel because it will drop you off out front, whereas the public ones drop you off across the canal and you will have to drag your luggage(for us 12 pieces) across the very crowded, hot, many steps Rialto bridge.

Really close to Rialto bridge so you could walk everywhere from there. It was lovely being able to walk out of the hotel in the morning and facing such a beautiful and picturesque view.

On mentioning our various feelings of 'unhappiness' at being moved to a \"new hotel\" away from the Grand Canal (the last thing we wanted was some American concrete block) and mentioning our rights in regards insurance and credit cards Carlos became quite aggressive and stated that Italian law permitted relocation as long as it was an 'upgrade'.

Off we trapsed, ensuring he knew we were only \"checking it out\". Incredible how grey and miserable the Rialto and surrounds had suddenly seemed to turn after our glorious arrival only 45 mins previously! To cut a long story short, the hote we went to, the Duodo Palace, was marvellous, full of character and a small canal outside our window. It is entirely possible that the ammunition of foreknowledge this site had given us, together with not signing anything before checking the rooms helped get us the best result. But this is not purely a Marconi problem. 3 other visiting parties we talked to had had the same experience but with worse outcome and they were all booked into different hotels. Another point is that every single arrangement we had made through Expedia, except the actual flight, presented problems: the water taxi from airport to the Rialto (my booking sheet suddenly had vanished), the 'Secret Tour' of the Doge's Palace (the booking form was incorrect) and the afore mentioned hotel booking.

Compensation came in the form of a bottle of fizzy wine!! 2. Double room then materialised on the second day, it was clean but over looked an alleyway where workman are currently replacing drainage. The works start at 7.45am and continue to 5pm. Reading the worker's sign it looks like this is a big project and will continue for some time.

Overall we were not disappointed. Like a couple of the other reviewers, we had emailed the hotel to request a room with a view but the email was returned as not deliverable (we used the email address on the hotel website). We also phoned but the man asked us to call back the next day as he was busy (we didn't call back). Arriving at the Marconi is a delight - if you arrive by train, simply take the Vaperetto number 82 up the Grand Canal. It only takes a few minutes and costs 5 Euros each. Disembark at the Rialto stop and you only need to walk over the bridge to get to the Marconi. We received a warm welcome at the Marconi - the lobby area is very clean and there is a great smell of freshness. The receptionist told us he could recommend some restaurants and also told us to take the free boat to Murano the next day. We declined but he didn't seem too concerned. He also gave us a pass to the casino which we didn't use. Like a previous reviewer, we also asked if we could have a canal view room and were told it would incur a 140 Euro supplement per night!! This was more than we had paid for the room so there was no way we were going to take him up on his offer. Our room was small but spotless (apart from a very dusty headboard!) and the bed left much to be desired as it was quite uncomfortable. I quite liked the fact that the room was small - it was cosy and we settled in straightaway. Breakfast was good and food plentiful. The best thing about the Marconi is its location. It is right next to the Rialto Bridge which means that every time you step out of the door, you are greeted with gondalas and the incredible bridge. It is also extremely central for St Mark's Square and every district of Venice is within walking distance. We grew to dislike the bar / restaurant next door to the Marconi. On our first night, we had a couple of small beers there and were charged 14 Euros. Every time we stepped out of the hotel, the bar men would hassle us to drink there again and we grew to really dislike their arrogance. There are far better, more atmospheric and cheaper places to drink in the quaint back streets. If you're on a budget, Venice has a few supermarkets which are a bit hard to find. For directions, just ask one of the many people you'll see carrying a yellow \"Billa\" carrier bag. At Billa, you can get some great, reasonably priced food and drink. Decent wine is about \u00c2\u00a33 a bottle and a can of Coca Cola is under half a Euro. Significantly less than the 2 and a half Euros charged in smaller shops. Overall we loved Venice, particularly exploring the smaller, quieter back streets. We like to eat well but found some of the restaurants to be mediocre and expensive for the quality of food. We also found that in January, the city started to fall asleep at about 10pm which was a shame. It is also worthy of note that all bars and restaurants are non-smoking so having a drink and cigarette late at night in a bar is not an option. Go to Venice - it really is unique but don't be ripped off. We found the best restaurants were those hidden away and full of Italians.

All in all, this is a delightful hotel in a fabulous location and we would certainly recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "November 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Zurich, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cRoom with a view\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4089108", "Content": "Having culled what I could from the web in advanced I settled on aiming for Room 101 at the Hotel Marconi. It was expensive, but it was important to get that particular room, I was taking my girl to Venice for her birthday and the whole experience had to be good. Room 101 has a narrow balcony overlooking the Grand Canal and a view of the Rialto bridge. The room was fantastic, very late 19th century feeling with none of the inconvenience. Of course, having great weather in November really helped the mood too. The only problem was that they had trouble getting a couple of my shirts ironed, which I found a bit unusual in a hotel of that calibre.", "Date": "November 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "BROOKLYN", "Title": "\u201cLoved everything about the Hotel Marconi\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4080535", "Content": "I had the pleasure of staying at the Hotel Marconi during a recent trip to Venice.

The Hotel Marconi experience was perfect. I had investigated on-line many different possibilities since we only had one night in Venice, before renting a car the next morning to drive to Cinque Terre. This hotel seemed right because of the location right on the Grand Canal by the Rialto Bridge. The water Taxi we took from the train station was able to dock right in front of the hotel so we didn't have to drag our luggage very far. The people running the place were very friendly and helpful. We had requested a room with a view and were not disappointed when we found out we had 2 balconies overlooking the Rialto and the Grand Canal. By Italian standards the room was good sized and the bathroom even had a tub. Just when we thought it couldn't get any better, the staff delivered a complimentary bottle of champage. We took a gondola ride with champage and glasses in hand, and then went out to a very nice restaurant the desk manager had recommended. Breakfast was also more than we expected the next morning and was included in our room price. The price of the room may have been a little high, but it was well worth it. Our short stay in Venice was wonderful and we will most likely stay at the Hotel Marconi again, hopefully for a longer visit.", "Date": "October 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC", "Title": "\u201cBest Location in Venice\u201d", "Author": "Jay Kyle", "ReviewID": "UR3889273", "Content": "My review is a little late but I wanted to weigh in on the Hotel Marconi. It couldn't be better located. At the foot of the Rialto Bridge. We had a room on the 3rd floor with a view of the alley. So what!! The room was clean and spacious and quiet. I didn't come to Venice to look out a hotel window. Step outside and view Venice from the Rialto Bridge. Spectacular. Centrally located, just minutes from St Marks Square and right next to the market area. This area is where Venice is most alive. The breakfast buffet was very nice and quite substantial for European Hotels. The staff was somewhat aloof but had boots for us when high tide flooded the entire city. It was fun, adventurous, and romantic to slosh around in the magical world of Venice. I would definately stay at the Marconi again. It is exactly what I expect when I travel to Europe, a clean affordable place to rest and sleep that is centrally located. I didn't go there to hibernate in a hotel room.

TV and air conditioning worked fine. 24 hours concierge: whoever was in charge gave us very good advice as to short trips, concerts, negotiating prices with gondolas. Also very fine restaurants nearby (as the Antico Calice). We are planning to come again - it was a pleasure to visit Venice with such a hotel to stay.

He recommended an amazing, off the beaten path, local restaurant to us that was the highlight of our trip--truly a memorable evening. I've been to Venice twice and that was the only great meal (food, service, hospitality, etc.) I've had there. Carlo knew we would enjoy the free boat ride to Murano but said we shouldn't feel pressured to buy anything (Murano is known for glassblowing). I'm glad he said that or else I would have been disappointed that he didn't warn us. We did end up buying a few items at another shop away from the factory where we were looked down upon for not purchasing the \"very overpriced\" items. There was a sweet guy demonstrating his art of blowing glass, however, and that made it worthwhile. Anyway, I wanted to get out of Murano as soon as possible. Don't go there if you can help it. There's too much to see on Venice. Back at the hotel, there was a variety of foods on offer for breakfast, which was nice. I got a scolding from one of the kitchen ladies when I put my croissant in the toaster, but other than that everyone at Hotel Marconi was really helpful and charming. The rooms were well-appointed and comfortable. Air conditioning, comfortable beds, nice bathrooms all added to the experience, even if the rooms were on the 4th floor. We didn't have a view, but I knew that would be the case when we booked. We still had natural light from the windows, however. The hotel is right on the Grand Canal so there's no need to feel pressured to have a view from your room, even though some of the rooms do have one. You just need to go to the lobby of the hotel and your view is right there. Other benefits: The hotel will exchange your dollars for euros at a decent rate, which was a service that was helpful to us. There were no surprises at check-out, which is always a good sign. The hotel looks after your bags on the day you check out. They'll even carry them down for you upon check-out. Great Place. The service we received from Carlo moved it from above average to excellent. I would definitely stay there again, but I won't be putting my croissant in the toaster next time. ;-)", "Date": "July 20, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Marconi", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d239486-Reviews-Hotel_Marconi-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$160 - $434*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">San Polo 729</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Fondamenta del Vin</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">30125</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Venice</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "239486", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/4b/f8/4bf8d890b8cbc83bf3d3607d9a7822ca6large.jpg"}}
