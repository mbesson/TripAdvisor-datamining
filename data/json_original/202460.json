It is about 100 meters from the airport bus, which is only a 30-minute ride from TXL. (This will probably be less of an advantage when the new airport opens; I don't know if the location will be as convenient then.) It's about 150 meters from the Hackesher Markt and the S-bahn station of the same name. It's about equally distant on foot from the Brandenburg Gate via Unter den Linden and from the heart of Prenzlauerberg. It's very close to Museum Island and Humboldt University; also the the Alexanderplatz, though not as close as the name would have you think, and in any case the Alexanderplatz should be avoided if possible. The hotel is on the site of a former deportation center (to the concentration camps) which is very movingly commemorated. I give the management a lot of credit for this. The hotel itself is excellent. My single room was very modern and comfortable. I didn't use the hotel breakfast. For ten euros it's probably worthwhile, but there are lots of coffee houses and bakeries within 150 meters, and I preferred to walk about in the morning. Internet access in the rooms was costly - which never seems justified to me - but it was available in the lobby without charge. It was OK for me, but it's something you might consider. There's a sauna and limited exercise room available, which I didn't use.

Close to all the attractions but tucked away from the noise of a bustling city. The room was very comfortable, if a bit on the small side although I think this was the luck of the draw as the friends we went with got quite a spacious room. The shower was brilliant, the room clean and the beds very comfortable. Staff were helpful without being intrusive. We were allowed to extend our check out time on the last day as we had a late flight at no extra charge. We had room service breakfast on the last day and that was of excellent quality - a great selection of pastries, cooked breakfast, juices, fruits, cold cuts and cheeses with very generous portions. The only negatives really was that the room was oppressively hot. We had to open all the windows to get a decent nights sleep and this was in late December! The weather outside was unseasonably mild yet the heating was turned up so high, you would think that we were experiencing sub zero temperatures. We also paid a premium rate due to the time of year and felt that it was a little over priced. All in all however, I would highly recommend this hotel for its location, comfort, food and staff.

Great for exploring the city. The area has some lovely outdoor eateries, bakeries, bars, restaurants, shops and galleries, mostly reasonably priced. The walking tours of the city start from Hakescher market also. We did the open top bus tour and there are stops nearby. Some of the main sights are easy to walk to such as the TV tower and brandenburg gate. The rooms were quite spacious and the beds very comfy. It was very clean and well appointed.

My brother and I shared a room, and my mother and sister shared another room across the hall. The hotel was clean and the rooms were comfortable, for the most part (nice down comforters on the beds). Big caution: the hotel shower/bath floors are very slippery, and there are no skid marks to prevent falls. The hotel also does not provide rubber bath mats unless asked. My elderly mother, who is still limber (she walks a lot and goes to the gym in the U.S.), fell during her second night in the hotel, because the tub was so slippery. When I showered in my room, I had also noticed the slippery tub surface. My mom hit her head very hard, and also her elbow and side. This was about 11 pm at night (my mother showers before bed). We called the night manager and they were slow in calling the doctor (saying it would take him 1-2 hours to show up). About 20 minutes after requesting the doctor, we called the manager to request extra pillows so my now-dizzy mother could sit up in bed while in extreme pain. Maybe 15 minutes later, the night manager came up with the extra pillows, but he had still not called the doctor. Finally, about midnight, the doctor was reached on the phone. Luckily, after my brother received advice on the phone from the doctor, my mother was eventually able to reduce the throbbing pain in her head (where a large bump had arisen) with ibuprofen, and was able to sleep. She did not have to miss the wedding the next day, though was in pain. My alert mother had the presence of mind to turn her head away from her face when she fell, otherwise, she might have had a worse injury. Had she fallen even harder (easy to do in these showers), she could have had very serious or fatal accident. In the morning, the hotel brought up a bath mat and hung it on the door outside my mother and sister's room. These items are not standard in bathrooms. If you stay in the Hotel Alexander Plaza, be sure you ask them for a bath mat before you shower or bath in your room, and exercise extreme caution in the small bathrooms (which have odd angles with the \"trendy\" modern design). I would also encourage guests to tell the management to put skid marks on the shower/bath surfaces.

The room was very spacious and spotless but oh that air-con!!!The room was roasting!!!Also there is no bath-tub(which we knew about before we arrived)but when you end up paying three times the amount you paid for in the uk it is quite a negative. As in other reviews you cannot get a better location to see the main sights of Berlin none of which we found to be more than an half hour's stroll away.Let me tell you that the best thing we did was to go on \"the Insider Walking tour which takes four hours and you dont need to book just turn up at one ther two starting points-ours was outside a coffee shop at Hackescher Markt.five minutes walk from the Alexander!!Our guide was an Aussie called Penelope(call me Pen)who had extensive knowledge and made everything very intersesting(her mannerisms reminded me of the dark haired lady who does the \"Hotel Inspector\"on tv.Also,if you sign up for another other of their trips you get a discount-we did but that's another story!!Suffice to say its the best 12 euro you'll spend in Berlin. To find a great selection of restaurants within strolling distance leave the hotel and head for Hackescher Markt,turn left on Oranienburger st.Let me recommend one-\"Oranium\"-god tasty food ,impeccable service and very reasonably priced. My review may seem a bit harsh for the Alexander Plaza but the issue with the air-con was a huge negative(I dread to think what it would be like in summer).Lastly,just let me say that Berlin was terrific-Good food,Great public transport and historically,one of the most interesting places you'll ever visit.", "Date": "February 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cork, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel.Central. modern, warm and spotlessly clean room.\u201d", "Author": "CandK0", "ReviewID": "UR96374953", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel before Christmas, 2010.

Apparently, the renovation was made for reasons of style only (the main colours changed from orange and turqoise to red and grey, which was a welcome change). All rooms we have stayed at so far have left nothing to be desired in terms of equipment and maintenace. The beds are very comfortable, the furniture is of high quality and has in large parts been especially designed for the hotel to match the interior design - characteristically, none of the rooms offers a similar ground-plan, and all deviate slightly from the rectangular norm, which is very appealing. All rooms are very quiet (sound proof doors and windows). The bathrooms are relatively small, but well-equipped (including hairdryers). The breakfast is served in a nice winter garden. It offers a decent variety, but could be more original given the relatively high price.

The hotel does not have an IT system nor manual processes that allow them to allocate smoking and non-smoking rooms according to reservations when the hotel is full.
