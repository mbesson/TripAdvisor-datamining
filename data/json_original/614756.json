{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Bad rooms worse service If you dont expect any service, come here. Good thing about this place is its location, but thats about it. I stayed here for three weeks with 16 other people (from all around the planet) to work in the time of the olympics. I had the same bedcovers for the first two weeks, recognizable by an obvious dirt spot. in other rooms the bathroom was wet, the sevice came with air-freshner spry to solve this problems. rooms and stairs are smelly, whch might be causes by wet-cleaning the carpet in the floor. in the first two weeks we all go two bottels of water a day, regardless of how much we drank of it. Then, they ran out of water. hm.Anyway, if you pay the normal rate of about 10 \u9227?a night this kinda surounding is about standart in BJ. Due to the fact, that we had to pay more than fifteen times that price (thank you, olymic organisators, great job!), we expected at least some service.But, no. sadly. The staff will smile friendly and do nothing. the high-speed internet is rather a slow-speed restricted site access connection which made us go to the nearby coffeeshops every day. If you intend to buy train tickets thru the hotel you should not expect any explanations on the seats (or beds) you will get. Calling a courier for some in-town delivery was also to much for them to handle. we also used their meeting room and wanted a tv set there to watch the Olympic games (in the end that was the reason we came here). After days (!) of argumentation (also with the BJ internat. Media Center who wouldnt give us a permission to do so first!) we ended up paying an additional 50 \u9227?a day (!!) just to watch the games in the meeting room! Beijing welcomes you!Subtotal: if you need a place to rest and dont care about the rest, Super 8 might just suit you. If, however, you expect at least a little service and sme clean rooms, look around. there are better and nicer places around. All of our team (out of which many came from third wolrd countries) said they have never had more comlicated staff or worse service in any hotel. Given that i have been travelling in china on and off for more than 10 years now and have been living in Shanghai for 3 years, nothing in china easily shocks me any more. but this place really made me get mad at the whole lot of them, because it seems like all negative stereotypes we have about the chinese seem to come together in one place.", "Date": "Aug 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR686563715", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "ttttShanghai"}, {"Content": "Good place to be This place is excellently located in a quiet street and five minutes walk from the subway. with many connections.

The rooms we got for 258RMB per night had both a king and a twin bed, with lots of space but minimal furnishings. During our stay, we saw a total of five different rooms. The wallpaper was peeling and the floors were worn in all five rooms. The rooms seemed clean enough, but see the video I reference below. The rooms come with an ethernet connection to the internet included in the price of the room.The staff at the front desk spoke adequate English. We had a split stay, and they were able to handle the situation gracefully when we had to change the dates for the split.The TV did not have any English channels, not even CCTV9.They offer a buffet breakfast for 10RMB. It was OK, but there were restaurants and food stalls just outside the hotel where you could eat for less.Most of the paths in the hutong were one-way alleys. The way to drive in was so complicated that I could not replicate it. Taxis may be reluctant to take you all the way in, but one that took us to the airport did pick us up at the front door. The driving exit was a short walk to Dong Si Bei Dajie, and the entrance to the correct alleyway was easy to find because there was a Super 8 restaurant on the corner.They do not provide bottled drinking water in the rooms, and the amount of toilet paper supplied is not really adequate. They also did not provide hot water for tea. The hotel has a store where you could buy water for 2RMB per bottle. They also sold TP, but we had our own TP supplies, so we never found out how much it cost. There is a convenience store on Dong Si Bei Dajie next door to the Super 8 restaurant where you could buy water for 1RMB per bottle.For those with an ATM card from Bank of America, there is a China Construction Bank branch with ATMs located on Dong Si Bei Dajie across the street from the Super 8 restaurant.There is reason to question the cleanliness of the glasses in the bathrooms. The reason I do not hold it against them is that this seems to be a common hotel practice, even in the USA. To see what I am talking about, see the video at [-]Overall, this is a budget hotel in a convenient location for tourists. It is OK if you know what to expect.", "Date": "Jan 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR450604422", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "SJCa"}, {"Content": "I felt cheated... This is our first trip to China  we were looking for a budget hotel for an extension 2nites stay apart fr the tour package. Considering there's a grp of 7 of us, this budget hotel fit our bill for 3 rooms. Fr the posted photos fr Asiatravel.com, the room looks clean  cosy, so we proceeded to book room type : King size bed wif RMB198/nite...all of us were so happy, thinking we got the best bargain wif its good location...Nightmare just began upon checked-in...sad music at background....With 8 luggages on hand, we had to walk 50metres fr main road cos no taxis were allowed to drive into the small  narrow road to the hotel. The Guest Officer attended to us were unfriendly. She spoke very fast Chinese  when asked to repeat what she said, she stared at us. After much hassel, we paid deposits of RMB100 for each room  checked into our rooms(8237/39/41). So happily we boarded the lift to 2nd flr, not knowing the rooms were actually at 2.5flr  we had to drag all luggages thru the staircase..tats not all...when opening the room's door, my jaw almost dropped, the room is so much smaller, room carpet is so dirty, furniture is so old, everything is reverse fr the photos posted  it was not a King bed config tat we booked. The bathroom is small, dirty  slippery too...I felt so cheated !!! I then called the reception  requested for King bed config per booking, the reception told me, nothing tat they can do, cos in their system, this was what booked. When asked to speak to their mgr, she just given excuses tat the mgr went for lunch  bback in late afternoon. She even asked me to call AsiaTravel branch in Beijing for clarification. Bottomline is, i need to top up to get changed to King bed config !!! Can't imagine this !!!We had no choice but to stay put for 2 nites...Other small details were, there's no waterjug to boil, had to ask for warm or hot waterjug, buffer bfast was cold  the cafeteria was not cleaned up immed, you just sat whichever table available wif the left-over...Other correction is, there's no McD down 2blocks away. It's now KFC.My advice to all travellers to China, always ask for small details eg, the distance(in metres  estimated travelling/walking time), any signboard, any landmark, otherwise, you will end up walking more than expected. Have least expectation  always in mind, you get what you paid for !!!", "Date": "Aug 28, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR663033163", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Cathpuang"}, {"Content": "You get what you pay for.... I stayed here for five nights. We payed about $25 U.S. dollars a night. Which is very cheap in the U.S. The hotel is located in an alley back off the main street so don't expect it to be around any other hotels or major shopping areas. When we arrived the lobby area was OK, the people checking us in didn't not speak as much English as I think they should have for it being a Super 8 Hotel chain. But they did well enough to get us checked in. We were asked to put down about $15 U.S. dollars deposit. I stayed in a room which had one double bed. The first thing I noticed was the rug outside of the bathroom which looked very dirty. The bathroom didn't seem as if it had been cleaned in a while. (Wear the free slippers they give you when you are showering). Besides the dirty bathroom I think the room was OK for $25. I ate breakfast which was about $1 U.S. dollar. It included basically juice, coffee, toast  several hot Chinese dishes which looked and tasted quite good. The hotel had free internet in the lobby which was cool and had a small store in the lobby as well. There are a ton of small stores (clothing, Chinese restaurants, convenience stores), along the main road that the hotel is by. The closest McDonald's is about a 15 minute walk. There is a nice shopping mall about a 30 minute walk away.The hotel may not be the nicest hotel in Beijing but it allows you to take in the culture of the Chinese people because it is not located in a busy tourist place where all the big hotels are.", "Date": "Dec 5, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR700359332", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "smitr2002"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d614756-r19336381-Super_8_Beijing_Dong_Si-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "614756", "Price": "$33"}}
