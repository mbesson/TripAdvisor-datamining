(30 cents),the staff is really and not artificially friendly. something i havent even seen in 600bucks per night hotels in los angeles or nyc. they are respectful and smiles are genuine. breakfast is just abundant....so bountiful. typical mexican.you can have everything from cake to complete meals ,all included in the room. enchiladas,crepes,meat,sincronizadas,tacos name it...the make it. again.respectful and well educated staff.american hotels could learn from this,really ! only 3 flaws: internet on floor 11 doesnt ever work and water was missing 2x. not funny but they tried at least to fix it. and number 3:they have a jacuzzi on the roof top but it was closed because of re arranging their artifcial lawn :)without this an excellent choice. ahhh about the location, you can walk to zocalo,the antique main square in 10 minutes (or take a train) and as well to chapultepec castle (a must !!!! ) in 30 minutes or another train. great hotel .will be back in september. really !!!! i love mexico !", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kingston upon Thames", "Title": "\u201cHandy but pretty basic\u201d", "Author": "anonKingston", "ReviewID": "UR122702432", "Content": "Stayed here as part of a group tour.

The electrical outlets are a bit \"wobbly\", be careful plugging things into them.

The rooms were also extremely noisy (we could actually hear people's conversations on the street below - not to mention the constant traffic noise and police sirens). I would only recommend this place because of the central location - very safe to walk around during the day but not at night.

The staff was friendly and spoke english. We ate dinner close to the zocolo but wished we had eaten dinner at the hotel. The breakfast, the next day, was really good! It was just what we needed to start the long journey back to the east coast. There are renovations going on, but we didn't let this distract us from the overall cleanliness of the hotel. My only complaint is that I got totally jipped from a taxi that one of the employees from the hotel put us in to go to the airport. The short trip cost a total of 150.00 pesos.

And considering that we got an amazingly low rate online, it must be considered good value for money. The rate did not include breakfast. The main thing going for it is its location. A 5 minute walk from the Almenida square with its shops, hotels and restaurants. From there you can take the metro and go to the Zocalo, though you should consider the 25 minute walk: worth it. I could be wrong but I got the impression that the quality of the rooms varies between the floors. We were on the \"cheap\" floor. The room was large enough, simply decorated and clean enough. The finishing was quite poor and there were bits and pieces not working as they should. Staff replaced one of the light bulbs as soon as we told them. One of the two lifts was not working (completely gutted, quite unsightly) and the other would not stop at our floor unless we kept pressing the call button. The rate did not include car parking but the hotel was doing valet parking and the car park is just on the other side of the road. One mistery that we are yet to solve is the address: once you reach the house number where the hotel should be, you have to go some 4-500 yards further.

It is right next to the Hidalgo Metro and walking distance from the Alameda Central, Palacio de Bellas Artes, and Zocalo in the historic district of Mexico City. The restaurant is also very good, with excellent service and a delicious breakfast (included). However, staying here requires so much patience and the incompetent and unhelpful hotel staff make staying here an absolute nightmare. The room was clean enough, but because you are located on Mexico City's main boulevard, there is a constant roar outside that makes it very hard to sleep soundly. We had issues with our bathroom plumbing and it took 3 days for them to change our rooms. The most frustrating aspect of the hotel is that you are unable to make outside phone calls. You have to call the operator and tell her the number you want to call and she will make the call for you. This system is inefficient and archaic. She continuously put me on hold and took 10-15 minutes to even dial the number. Sometimes she took down the number wrong, so I had to call back and repeat it. Meanwhile, you are being charged for all the wrong numbers, whether or not it's your fault. It took a full day for me to find a way to make an emergency-related international call from the hotel and finally I had to sit with the operator at her desk and dial from there. The staff was unable to understand and respond to the urgency of my situation. They were unapologetic and unhelpful. I will say that the hotel was also hosting members of a huge international conference during my stay, so they were stretched, but given the nature of all the other reviews, I would say that it's safe to say that this hotel is one that everyone should pass on.", "Date": "August 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Utah", "Title": "\u201cWould stay there again!\u201d", "Author": "carefulraveler", "ReviewID": "UR10667934", "Content": "The staff was friendly and helpful.

I recommend folks to try to get a room on the eighth floor, balcony section because it does have views of Alameda Park and that crazy horse sculpture on Reforma. I have nice hot water and I can get the net via my wireless. Now I had to cajole the good folks who work here to get a password, the manager came to my room to see that yes I could get a connection so he set me up good. This hotel is yes, dated decor wise but I am not staying here for the decor. The free breakfast hits the spot and nearby are good cheap eats, a farmacia, a convenience store, a Sanborns and of course the main drag, Reforma which is interesting in itself. The TV has some english channels and CNN and Fox in english. For the price and location you do quite well. This hotel attracts business travelers and as one I have found the staff to be very helpful especially since I walk with a cane and have a hard time getting around. I have stayed in all sorts of hotel worldwide and I would stay here again just because of the staff. Very conscientious folks indeed. Heck, not a bad place at all.

The furniture was basic to say the least and the bed was a disgrace. The toilet bowl was cracked as was the sink.

There is no air conditioning and in you want to use their wireless facility you need to be on either the 3rd or 9th floor! They also have no safes in the room and the TV reception is non-existent.
