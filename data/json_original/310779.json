{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great Place and What a Bargain Hotel Elite is a satellite of the Hotel Montreal (about a block away) The Elite was great! The room was cheerful and clean. The receptionist (Nadya) was so helpful and welcoming. There isn't a receptionist there after 3pm-ish but I had my own key and there was never any problems. There isn't a lift, but the stairs are normal size and angles -- none of the European steepness. The place was quiet. THe room I had overlooked the street which could be a bit noisy at times but it's a city, you deal. It was air-conditioned, a definite plus. The location was convenient to the train station (without being dodgy) and about a 10 minute walk from the city center. There was a shower in the room which was great. The WC was shared but it was clean and never an issue; it was almost like staying in a house with other guests rather than in a hotel. There were only about 10 rooms so not really that stark hotel feel. Overall, it was one of the best places that I stayed and would absolutely stay there again, especially for the price. Nothing extravagent, but it's a clean, safe place to rest your head.", "Date": "Jun 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR863848484", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "historychick13"}, {"Content": "Love Florence and Hotel Elite       Evening in Florence", "Date": "Dec 9, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR651285802", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Tom_Cheryl"}, {"Content": "La Dolce Vita First, let me just say I would sleep on the ponte veccio just to be in Florence at any given moment since my husband and I returned from there. But...instead we did stay at the Hotel Elite. What a wonderful experience, we felt as if we were in a movie, small, quaint room, little shower in the bathroom, nice and comfortablel bed and shutters that swing open to reveal the sights and sounds of Florence below. If you are looking to really enjoy Italy and have a clean, safe place to lay your head then stay here...if you are looking for fancy down comforters and room service...well then you don't deserve to be in Italy in the first place!", "Date": "Jun 22, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR355892548", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "travlnfools"}, {"Content": "Really enjoyed my stay! I have just recently returned from a week long stay in Florence, May 17 - May 22/06 staying 4 nights at the Hotel Elite, which I found in the Let's Go Italy Guide Book. First of all you need to appreciate hotels in Florence are very expensive and seem to be always booked so you really get what you pay for. Hotel Elite is really close to the train station in a relative safe area. To get up to the hotel you enter through a gate and head up the dark stairs which can seem daunting at first, but it's a cute little hotel that's typical. for Florence. The good thing is you can walk from here to all the major sites in the about 10 minutes or less. I paid 70 euros a night for a double room for myself with shower and toilet included. Always confirm you want a private shower and toilet the room! It was a nice clean room with a comfy bed, tv, air, clean modern bathroom - except for the fact my bathroom was one of those shower rooms where there isn't really a tub or shower stall - so half the bathroom gets wet (as it's supposed to when you shower...(it took a bit of getting used to I must admit) but I noticed that other rooms had regular showers I knoticed.The real appeal of this hotel is the wonderful, friendly, knowlegeable manager Nadia Who is a real gem. She helps her guest reserve gallery tickets, knows what's worth seeing and is just helpful and wonderful. She made my stay worthwile. Hotel Elite has a 2 star rating which I think is appropriate after staying at a 1 star in Florence a few days later. I recommend this hotel for the money...but book early! Also May was the absolute perfect month to visit Florence for prices, beautiful temperatures, and the fact that the city isn't overcrowded!", "Date": "Jun 3, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR824832807", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Huge rooms, clean, close to train station!!! This small hotel run by Nadia..is just perfect for a stay in Quaint Florence. This is one of the biggest rooms and bathrooms you will find in Europe. Very basic decor, but very clean. Comfortable bed. And very affordable. Close to the train station, and Nadia is just the warmest person ever!! I would definitely recommend this place, and would stay here again, when I return to Florence.", "Date": "Mar 14, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR181618439", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Naod21"}, {"Content": "Personal attention makes the Elite special We stayed at the Hotel Elite for 5 days, and then for three more days coming out of Rome back to France. The hotel facilities are average for a European hotel, but it is the treatment you receive from Nadia that makes this place special! From the very first day, she made us feel totally welcome. We always felt like we had someone happy to see us at the end of a long sightseeing day. The hotel is very near the train station, making it very convenient for us. Security was tops, with the outer wooden door locked at night, an inner iron gate (always locked) and the door to the hotel itself at the top of a flight of stairs. Unlike most other European hotels, you are given a complete set of keys to all of the above, so you can come and go when you like. Although we we packed very heavy, we didn't feel that the stairs were a problem - Nadia helped us carry our luggage up and down. Like most European hotels, they do allow smoking in the room, so there is a tobacco smoke odor to the rooms. No breakfast is included, but you can easily buy a croissant at the bakery just around the corner. Nadia keeps the place sparkling and it is an haven for the harried tourist!By the way, if you are planning a trip, budget your shopping money for Florence. There are great buys on leather, cashmere, stationery, and clothing at the outdoor markets. We spent all our souvenir money in Florence!", "Date": "Jan 21, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR326193797", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "LindaJean"}, {"Content": "Staff made us feel like part of the family! The first class treatment that we got from the staff is the reason for this 5 star review. From our first contact with them (frantically calling for a room last minute from Rome) to our very last day they were sincere, helpful and so kind to us. They made us feel welcome and were happy to recommend restuarants, shopping and day trips. Every morning we were greeted by an enthusiastic Buon Giorno by Nadia and her darling mum. They really did go above and beyond the call of duty for us for the 7 nights we spent there and I would stay there again in a heartbeat. For me this is way more important than a fancy hotel where the staff treat you like a number. Also, good location, close to train and walk to the Duomo to boot! Reservations strongly recommended, with their amazing rates they book up fast.", "Date": "Nov 12, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR923342082", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Friendly, clean, basic We only stayed at the Elite one night, but found it to be more than adequate for our needs. The room was spacious and clean. The bathroom was huge. The staff is incredibly nice and helpful. No breakfast, which was fine for us because we left early to go back to the airport. This hotel is very convenient to the train and bus station, but be forewarned that it's a slightly dodgy area (pickpockets, etc.) because there are so many hotels  tourists. The only drawback I found was the fact that it's on the second floor...and there is no lift.
