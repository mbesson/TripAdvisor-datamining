Every employee has a friendly smile for you and offers their assistance if you need it. Check in was fast and easy, they let us check in early and upgraded us to a room with a kitchen at no extra charge. There are 2 pools, I think one is a salt-water pool, overlooking the ocean. Basketball, volleyball, shuffleboard courts, plenty of places to lounge and enjoy the beach. Continental breakfast from 6:30a - 9:30a consisting of bagels, danishes, yogurt, OJ, milk, cereal.. worked for us! There aren't really any hotspots nearby but within a 2 mile range you can find something easily. The Ocean Deck is right up by the pier (great place!) as well as Joe's Crab Shack on the pier.. my first time there - I loved it! Grocery store/pub across the street from the hotel (Don't go to Stavros! = EW!). I can't think of one bad thing to say about El Caribe.. we were hesitant upon arrival but very pleased when we got there and checked it out, and we will definitely be going back!

A nice pool area, easy access straight to the beach, plenty of parking, and friendly staff helped make the stay nicer. As for the problems, there were many, none of which by themselves I would call a deal breaker. For starters, the \"free breakfast\" is anything but. You can get some cereal, prepackaged pastries, yogurt, milk, OJ, and a bagel, and that is the entirety of the breakfast menu. Every door slams shut and you will hear doors slamming all day and night. The wifi internet didn't work at all, or was barely functional when it did work. Instead, connect to the wifi at next door Perry's Resort, it at least works. The hot water takes forever to get going and the water pressure is barely enough to take a shower. Every time someone in the building flushes a toilet, your shower will slow to a drip for quite awhile before powering back up again. The ceiling leaked in parts of the room, though it did rain non-stop for the duration of our stay. The beds fold-out from a closet (I'm not kidding), and they were mostly uncomfortable and too small. The elevators only worked half the time. Finally, on the last day of our stay I found a dead cockroach by the couch. The A/C leaked water all over the carpets.

Another roach in the bathroom, I killed it. Another roach on the wall of the bedroom, I killed it and to top everything off, as my mother pulled the covers to get into bed a roach crawled out of the BED! That was the last straw.

I went back to the checkin counter, and I ask her if there had been some mistake? Knowing I specifically ask her if this we were being assigned was like the room we were shown the day before....Almost immediately she became defensive, raised her voice, and then told me; \"because we booked online, we did not qualify for the type of were shown the day before\". I objected and she became more upset and got even louder. By this time there was a line of peole behind me. She showed no regard for me or for them, and continue her verbal assult. Once again I objected to the\"bait and switch\" tactics\" they had used to prevent us from canceling the day before. Due to the fact that we booked online there was a 24 notice cancellation clause. Now at checkin, inspite of the fact the \"bait and switch\" was taking place, we could not cancel. If we did we would not receive a refund. It ended up, after I stood my ground and stood there silently for 20-25 minutes, with other guests waiting to check in, she assigned us a room like the one we were shown the day before.

We took the room without a kitchen, and ate all of our meals out that week - the additional expense was significant, and our experience was not a good one.

There are two shuffleboard lanes and a hoops court in a parking lot. All in all a nice layout. With a Winn Dixie right across the street the location was nice too. A mini golf place too. We could not have been more pleased with the the facility. The elevators might have moved a bit faster but this is NOT a new building. I prefer the older places anyway.

We walked in the room, and were greeted with a distinct mould smell. We noticed the fridge was filthy, and I think the bedspreads were purchased in 1950 and never replaced! We proceeded to the balcony and the 2 provided chairs were completely rusted, and as an added bonus, the balcony overlooked 4 loud air conditioning units! The bathroom was complete with a shelf with paint peeling and wood exposed and I wouldn't bathe my pet in the bath. We went to the office and although the staff was polite we were told no other units were available. So we know now that if you're not a regular you then get what we called the dungeon rooms! We went back to our room to call the site where we booked this room and our phone didn't work, no dial tome!!! I could see, that the part of the hotel with the air balloons on the wall should be demolished and we never got a chance to \"see\" any other part of the hotel, where I could understand where the \"positive\" comments come from. We went back to the front desk and asked to use their phone where we finally got great service from the booking site and got some great customer service. As I walked away, I heard a faint, ....we apologize....Really??? not even a reason for the apology! and I know the manager was not sitting far away, and never came to talk to us.

The kitchen had a toaster, which we did use, to toast our free bagels from breakfast, a microwave and coffee machine (if you wanted to make coffee you needed to bring your own because they don't provide it).

Considering one of our friends that was with us works with animal control and is very familiar with what a flea and tick looks like, we laughed that off. They moved us to a new room and steamed our clothes, but said they could do nothing for our luggage! So I guess we're taking those in cases home with us and moving them with us to our next room?

If you can get a room on the water- there aren't many but it's worth it. The view was spectacular- the room was right on the ocean with spectacular sunrise and sunset views- - and having a deck you can sit on makes it even more special. Unfortunatety coming back into the room brings you back to reality. The rooms are painted a bright yellow- yes, yellow- and have nothing on the walls. There is aluminum foil lining the drip pans on the stove that hasn't been changed in a while- yuck. The bathroom was tiny and cramped and definitely in need of an upgrade from the low flow shower head on down. While spartan best describes the room, the bed was comfortable and cable worked so...for what was paid (<$50) for a weekend night it was a very good value.

Continental breakfast was included: cereal, bagels, pastries, toast, yogurt, and homemade donuts, along with coffee, milk, and juices. There are 2 pools, which was nice because if one was packed the other was available. My vacation is 2009 went without a hitch and never had a problem. It was quiet and relazing.

There was one family that rented out the entire hotel for a reunion except for a few rooms (mine, the one next to mine, and a few others). They were complete pigs! They threw their garbage everywhere. On the grounds, in the pools, on the beach, everywhere they were there was garbage (including used condoms). They blasted music all day/night. We went to complain at the desk several times, but they refused to do anything about it. There are hours for the pools that stated they were to be used from 6a-11p, but they used until all hours of the night making noise and screaming. Security just stood there and watched- I honestly believe that he was afraid. After the family left the hotel went back to being immacualtely clean and quite- just like the previous year. I left something in my room and they even mailed it back to me (granted, it took them 2.5 months to mail it, but I did get it back).

The suite is so spacious that it could easily accommodate five or six people without feeling cramped. The kitchen is handy, although it could use a little more counter space, and the jacuzzi is nice enough but not really necessary. Never used the pool because the beach was right there, and the hotel is in a relatively quiet area of Daytona Beach so it felt like we had the beach to ourselves. Early in our stay the hotel hosted a wedding and reception, but up on the seventh floor we didn't hear a thing despite being directly above the conference room. We saw a lot of Florida plates in the parking lot, which suggests that locals favor the El Caribe as good value and a good stay. The only bad thing I can say about the hotel is that their high speed internet was spotty at best.

We came to Daytona on the 12th day of our trip around Florida, and found that Daytona itself isn't exactly what we'd expected - after the rush of Orlando, it felt like grinding to a halt, as Daytona Beach is a very quiet, almost elderly feeling place. Coupled with the change of pace, it was disappointing to behold El Caribe - a slightly dilapidated green motel, and it had a van parked outside with workmen doing something with saws whcih didnt help. The scary old lift that took us up to our room didnt help much either. But that's where the dispapointment ended - the room was big, the view was awesome, and the facilities (internet, pool, basketball court, sun loungers, etc) were all easily accessible. The place is literally on the beach, so it was a great place to wake up and wander into the sea... Daytona Beach really isn't the kind of place I'd recommend going for nightlife, so the out of the way location of the hotel is nearly an irrelevant point, but it's worth mentioning that it's about 3 miles from the main shopping area (though it is on the same road). It's near enough to gas stations, a 7-11 and 2 mini golf courses (great fun) though. My one major complaint, ignoring the slightly disappointing look of the hotel, was that the connecting door between our room and the next wasn't fitted very well, so we could hear the screaming brat children next door throughout our stay. We had a great stay here regardless - the perfect way to wind down after Orlando, and the view was great. I'd recommend keeping your stay relatively short though as there's not much beyond mini golf and the beach to occupy you.

I call and speak to the Agent working the front desk and he said the Orgional rate from room 1705 which had no kitchen in the South Tower and just viewed the Ocean was 130.00 so he said being that no one got the room it was going to be 79.00. So he said for the discounted rates we would have to talk to a Manager when we arrived. So we asked for one and was told that they don't give Florida resident rates out last minute. However we were dead tired and weren't going to argue so we go to our room. When we got to the room we noticed that room was nice however within a few hours of being in it i realised why he couldn't pre sell the room and here is why.

The bathroom everytime we turned on that light made a constant humming sound. Their is no vending machine on every floor just one. And the chip machine was totaly broken that is on the first floor. And the elevator is slowy going because it kept jolting at every floor it stopped at.
