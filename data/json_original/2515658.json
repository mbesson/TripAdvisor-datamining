We chose this hotel because the one we normally stay in during our trips to Legoland was booked. We were due to arrive late Tuesday night. We had booked a non-smoking, 1 king bed suite. Knowing we would arrive late, I called Tuesday morning to advise the hotel that we would be checking in close to midnight and that I would love to have a crib waiting for us in our room since we would have a 2 year old ready for bed by the time we arrived. The lady at reception said she would send one right up and noted our late arrival. As planned we arrived around 1am. I went to the front desk to check in and the gentleman took an unusually long time to check us into a room. When I asked him if there was a crib in the room he said no but that he would send one up. We carried all our sleepy kids up to the 12th floor and walked into a very smoky room, my kids instantly noticed and complained of the smell. I called the front desk and told them that we had reserved a non-smoking room. He told me that they had over-booked and that I had the only room left in the entire hotel. I proceeded to tell him that its not my problem that they overbooked and that I reserved and was paying for a non-smoking room, how can they just give my room away? He said that they had oxidized the room extra to try to get rid of the smell for me...whatever that means it didn't work. He had no further explanation other than to apologize and offered me to speak to the manger at 7am. Still waiting for the crib to arrive, the one that was promised to have already been in our room, we put the kids to bed. The room smelled like an old musty smoky casino, I couldn't sleep and ended up hanging out in the lobby's fresh air until about 330am. I went back to the room fell asleep for 2 hours, showered and went to the lobby again to hang out until breakfast was served at 6am. At 7am I spoke to the assistant manager that was very surprised by what had happened. He apologized and told us we would not be charged for the room that night. He told us he would move all of our belongings as soon as a new room was cleaned later that morning. I left all of our belongings in the front room and when we got back from Legoland everything (except for the crib, which I had to request for again) was in a new smoke free room. The rest of our stay was great, but that first night was awful. The kids tossed and turned all night and barely slept, my husband and I barely slept after a six hour drive to San Diego. As a family with a toddler and two older kids we regularly stay at suite type hotels, which are considerably more expensive but for the added convenience of having 2 rooms it is worth it, so to have this happen to us was really a shocker especially from an Embassy Suites.

It's an atrium-style layout with 11 floors. I had a 1 bedroom suite (true suite, not divider walled) that was spacious and well appointed. The hotel was completed renovated 5 years ago and further fitted with flat screen TVs a year ago. In addition to the usual coffee maker there is also a small fridge and microwave. Internet is about $10 and self-parking is $20. Everyone was friendly--I had to go to the nearby Hyatt for dinner and the bellman was happy to drive me over in the van. The fitness room is a little small for the size of the hotel, just three treadmills, a couple of elliptical trainers, and that's about it. It wasn't too busy when I was in there at 8 am but it wouldn't take much to fill it up. The indoor pool looked nice but too small for laps. There is a hot tub outside. The free breakfast buffet has a good selection of hot and cold items. It ends at 9 am so I stopped by after my workout, loaded some things onto a tray and ate in my room later, which worked out well. It did seem to get a little crowded and there were several people waiting in line for the omelet station. The Embassy Suites is not as nice as the Hyatt 5 minutes down the road, and you can't beat the Hyatt's beautiful lap pool and nextdoor enormous health club which Hyatt guests can use (for $13 I think).

After staying at nearby the Hilton Garden Inn (Del Mar) and DoubleTree (Del Mar), the Embassy ranks at the bottom of my list of Hilton choices when I travel to this area. It is not a terrible hotel, by any means; it just isn't my favorite among the various Hilton brand options in the area. For a family get-away on a weekend it may be the best option in the area, with the large family room and spacious accommodations. During my stay, however, I had the impression that the hotel seems a bit \"tired\" and stale (as are many Embassy Suites around the country), and the general feel of the hotel left me wanting more. That being said, all my interactions with the staff were very pleasant and the check in was very speedy and friendly. The Good: The location is very convenient, right off the 805 freeway and across from a large shopping mall with lots of options for food and beverage. A quick 15 minute drive over the hill takes you to the beach at La Jolla and the quaint and upscale shops and restaurants there. The rooms are very spacious and comfortable with a typical Embassy Suites layout of sitting room with sofa/desk in the front room and a bedroom in the back. The views from the taller floors are nice (for this area, which is very commercial). The bathroom amenities are nice (they even included a razor, shaving cream, toothbrush, toothpaste, and a mending kit). The linens and towels are very nice quality, however the pillows are synthetic and very spongy - if you are used to down pillows, you may wake up with a neck-ache like I did every morning. Staff is very friendly and helpful The Not-so-Good: This hotel is one of the more expensive Hilton options nearby for the regular room rates. Add $20 a day for parking and it becomes significantly more expensive, without delivering additional meaningful value. The parking garage fills up quickly and is so narrow you have to back up if someone comes the other way while trying to exit, which is incredibly frustrating when you are just trying to get to the office in the morning. The Free Breakfast: Standing in line for breakfast. Really? Come on! I am fortunate to get free breakfast at *any* Hilton (as HHonors Gold or Diamond) so the \"free\" breakfast at the Embassy was not my reason for choosing the hotel. However, if it had been, the deal-killer for me is that there is no quick buffet for hot items like pancakes, french toast, waffles, etc. Instead you have to queue up behind everyone in a long serpentine line to order one person at a time. The problem is so bad, they even post a \"warning\" about it in the rooms!) You must stand in line for anything besides cold cereal, muffins, or toast. After standing in line 15 minutes my first day for two pancakes, I opted to go across the street to Corner Bakery for my breakfast the remaining days of my stay. As to the rest of the food options at the \"breakfast buffet\", they are less numerous and of lower quality than the aforementioned HGI and Doubltree, both of which offer very nice (and fast) breakfasts by comparison. For example, the coffee at the Embassy is made from coffee-flavored syrup and hot water that is mixed as you dispense it - like the stuff in a college dorm or cruise ship - it is not even brewed. (That was a big turn-off to me) I found the air in my room to be stale smelling; almost as though someone had smoked in the room some time before and the smell never quite cleared (there isn't a way to crack a window for fresh air). Also, I happened to check in on an unusually cold and rainy evening and I turned on the heater in the room (which inexplicably had been turned completely off). I quickly realized why it had been disabled by a previous occupant - the fan was noisy and the air that issued from the vents smelled awful - dusty and dirty and reminiscent of the exhaust from an old vacuum cleaner that needs to have its bag changed. In fairness, heaters probably aren't used much in San Diego, but it was still off-putting. Bottom line, if you are traveling on business and don't mind driving an extra 10 minutes, I would personally recommend the nearby Hilton Garden Inn or Doubletree hotels - you'll save money on the room rate and get free parking, plus you will have a newer room and a far superior breakfast in the morning, with equally friendly and helpful staff.", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gig Harbor, Washington, United States", "Title": "\u201cTerrific Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Rozalyn B", "ReviewID": "UR125318450", "Content": "We had a great experience at the Embassy Suites in La Jolla.

Great stay! We would have liked connecting rooms, but we've traveled enough together that we know that chance is hit and miss. We always try to make the effort to stay at the Embassy Suites because of the free breakfast and happy hour, and this was by far the best one we've stayed at. It is primarily a business hotel, which was nice for us because it meant our kids were competing with a million other kids for the pool in the evening! Thursday night was the best, as there was low business traffic. By Saturday night the place was PACKED, so we retired early as to not compete with the pool crowds. The breakfast lines can get quite long, but if you plan your morning and take the advice of the breakfast traffic card they put in your room, you will have no problems. (Wake up earlier... I'd rather lose 30 minutes of sleep then waste 30 minutes in the omelet line...). The breakfast is hot and plentiful, and basic buffet flavor as far as that goes. We gorged ourselves so as to hold off lunch longer throughout the day, and it is easy to do so with the large selection they have. The happy hour was great each night. Not as much of a food \"spread\" as we've have seen in other Embassy Suites, but again, as this is more of a business hotel, they aren't putting out the treats a family on vacation usually wants. All in all we all agreed it was worth it to stay in beautiful La Jolla for our San Diego trip. An added bonus is the mall across the street (we went there for dinner the first night. Fun!

On the positive side, the rooms are pretty clean and have most things you would expect, minus great views, even on the top floor. On the negative side, we felt that the accommodation was not worth what we paid... The USP of embassy suites is the cooked to order breakfast, and frankly it was a bit of a disappointment with limited selection... And I can't believe that a hotel that caters to tourists can have breakfast finish at 9am! We had to get out of bed just to have breakfast, after not having had enough sleep, which in a way ruined the rest of the day... We could see many others who were half asleep during breakfast, or come in their bathrobes!

When you factor in these perks, you can justify the price being somewhat higher than other accommodations. In this case, some of those perks were cancelled out by the $20 daily parking fee, but that seems typical for the San Diego area. Hard to find lodging without some form of parking that tends to be from $15 to $35 daily, so the Embassy Suites is right there. Although their parking garage is poorly laid out and because of the single lane entrance/exit, if the garage is full then someone will have to back up if you find yourself in a situation where someone is traveling in the opposite direction from you; i.e., coming in while you're trying to exit. Because parking is scarce, you may also find yourself playing that awkward game where the car that wants your space will absolutely, positively not budge to give you a single inch of extra space because of the fear that your spot will be taken by someone else. Is this the fault of Embassy Suites? Probably not, but when it's rainy and windy in San Diego... it's just not fun. The parking garage has two covered levels and one rooftop level and you do have to walk in open air to get into the structure. FYI for those rainy times. I was surprised that the room was so dark. You have to use the interior lights at all times while in the room. The bathroom has an awkward layout with its huge, oversized door that requires all the space in front of the wardrobe to swing. Beware of that to avoid hitting anyone that is getting something out of the closet. There is an interior control of the cooling/heating in the room. We required a/c while there and it was terribly, horribly loud during the night. The worst part was that there was some sort of interior plumbing that sounded like a waterfall erupting at various times during the night. Loud enough to disturb sleep. And the bed was just too soft and lumpy for our necks and backs. Room 606. The lobby is inviting. Made-to-order breakfast was fast and good. An abundance of choices with a grill that served any style of cooked eggs, pancakes, french toast, sausage, bacon, potatoes. Around the buffet area you would find pastries, cereals, toast, muffins, yogurt, fruit, tea, coffee, fountain soda, fountain juice(s). At the manager's receiption you could be served just about any cocktail of your choice, wine, beer and the appetizers were pretzels, popcorn, chips/salsa, carrots/celery/zucchini with ranch dressing dip.

The lobby was quite chaotic, esp. during breakfast and happy hour reception. However, the staff were well trained and were able to keep the place together. Minses: - PARKING CHALLENGES ~ The hotel garage is really TIGHT. We drove a RX350, and had difficult times getting in and out of the garage. If you had to use the garage, I suggest parking your car on the first level. On the upper floors, inflow and outflow traffic SHARE ONE SINGLE LANE. We had to park our car on the street on the 1st night b'cos the garage was full, due to a function at the hotel (Hotel did refund our parking fees after we spoke). And street parking was quite tricky on the Labor Day weekend. Patrons to PF Changs would park their car on the street too. We were lucky to always get the LAST spot for our car when we return at around 8pm. - ROOM NEAR ELEVATOR IS NOISY ~ We stayed in a room #830, across from the hotel elevators. My boys slept on the pullout in the sitting area. They complained about the noisy elevators and people getting in/out of it. My husband and I slept in the bedroom, and we did not hear the noises. Guess rooms near elevators are ok as long as no one is sleeping in the sitting area. - INDOOR POOL NOT HEATED, AND OUTDOOR JACUZZI IS TINY ~ well, just our preference - FEE FOR WIRELESS INTERNET ~ However you may use the business center computers to get free access to internet. There are only 2 computers. * The frontdesk has printouts of restaurants nearby, mall map as well as a local map of La Jolla. ** There is a small, nice and kid-friendly pizzeria called Regent Pizza on the NE corner of La Jolla Village Dr. and Regent Rd.

It shares a parking lot with PF Changs. 2 major strip malls with McDonalds, CVS, Baskin Robbins, Supermarkets ect... are located within 3 blocks (10 minute walk). On of the most beautiful churches you will ever see was less then a mile away. Was even nicer at night when it was lit up. PARKING IS NOT AN ISSUE: we had 5 cars and had no problem parking on the street at all hours of the day & night. Property is nothing special, located in area with office buildings. Small fountain and nice landscaping as you approach. 3 story parking garage off to the side. Inside lobby had nice ponds with large coi fish. Several large screen TV's had sporting events on all night. Pool is small, but served its purpose. Plenty of towels all day and night. Pool closed at midnight. Sauna and hot tub were clean. Gym was small but again, served its purpose. Rooms were spacious and clean. Only negative would be the loud air conditioning units cycling on & off. Refrigerator was not working but maintenace brought up a new unit in under 5 minutes. Towels were plentiful & house keeping did a great job all week. Rooms had blowdryer, iron & board, coffee machine & microwave. 2 TV's, No in room safe, but you could get a safety box down at front desk. Washer & dryer were free and available pretty much all the time. Great perk ! Complimentary breakfast was good ever day. Never waited more then 5-7 minutes on line for cook to order omlettes. Always plenty of food. Good selection of frenchtoast, pancakes, eggs, cereal, pastries, fresh fruit, yogurts, oatmeal & 4 different juices, 5 different teas. Breakfast was a great value, only drawback was that it ended at 930 on weekdays (would prefer 10am) 1030 on weekends. Finding table was never an issue and the dining area was kept clean by freindly & smiling workers. Complimentary Happy Hour 530-730PM every nite was another great value. Nothing like coming in from sightseeing all day and grabbing a cold bud light or killians. The hotel seems to cater to alot of families, would have loved to seen a room set up with video game, ping pong table ect... Think security guards would appreciate that as well as they were chasing kids all weekend long. lol Overall, the Embassy Suites La Jolla was a great value. It wouldnt have been my choice of hotel being that it was 20 minutes away from most attractions, however it was easy to get to and never any traffic. Staff was friendly and helpful. Would reccommend this hotel to other families. Only 10 minutes from La Jolla Coves where you can go kayaking to the caves. Also worth the short drive at sunset to \"Childrens Pool\" where you can also see seals & sealions hanging out on the rocks. Seaworld was nice, San Diego Zoo was over rated (Bronx Zoo much nicer) Petco Park is beautiful baseball stadium. Old Town was nice with good Mexican Restaurants, Little Italy was Little. Only several blocks long and located on India Street, still cant figure that out??? Gaslamp Section was nice. Bay Front was nice. Coronado is definetly worth a day trip. Beaches of Southern California are over rated. Miami Beach & Florida beaches blow them away. Water is warmer, sand is whiter & softer. San Diego was a nice, small & clean city.

Stong point 1 is location. For family travel, we prefer suburban La Jolla to downtown San Diego. Near (but not next to) interstate 5. Not beachfront, but short drive to beach. Next to a shopping complex and office park. San Diego attractions and neighborhoods are easy to get to from hotel site. Strong point 2 is quality of premises and staff. Personnel are welcoming and efficient. Facilities are well maintained (gardening), exercise facilities/small pool, laundry facilities on premises, business center w/ pcs and printers. Facilities otherwise consistent with Embassy Suites hotels in other cities. Strong point 3 is quality of Embassy Suites features. Complimentary breakfast is top-notch (good selection, quality), efficient (guests served quickly w/o being made to feel rushed). Complimentary manager's reception also first class, not just an afterthought. What we experienced here was better than what we've found at other Embassy Suites locations. Weak point is a $20/night parking fee. I could understand this at a downtown location or with valet services but find off-putting at a self-park suburban location. Another reviewer mentioned on-street parking, but I respectfully disagree: it's really hard, on the spot, to make a snap judgment about availability and safety of on-street parking. To be candid, what bothers me most is the extra charge at a chain that markets lots of features included at a fixed price; had Embassy Suites increased the room rate by $20/night, we'd probably still have chosen the hotel. Our stay was for family travel, and our review is positive. But we'd echo other reviewers and caution business travelers. This hotel offers good service so has high occupancy rates, with lots of couples, families and school groups; this, plus the building's atrium design, generate traffic and some noise. For business travelers seeking calm, there's an Embassy Suites at downtown San Diego that's may be better suited (with no disrespect intended towards management of the La Jolla Embassy Suites).", "Date": "June 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Upstate NY", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Value-good location\u201d", "Author": "fingerlakesdweller", "ReviewID": "UR113125153", "Content": "We found the staff at Embassy Suites, LaJolla to be exceptionally courteous, making us feel most comfortable & welcome.

It wasn't the first choice nor it was out of faint of the heart. However I will admit the loyalty program pays. Most of the business travelers pick their stay based on the location. I am no exception. However keep in mind that the location of the hotel isn't a tourist hotspot, although La Jolla is about 10 miles to the west and the major tourist attractions are down south. What surprised me is that there are a lot of families here, which translates into lots of kids. Guests aside, the hotel is clean, modern and very guest friendly. Free breakfast, 2-hour free drink daily, what else can you ask? I stayed in the Executive suite. Upon check-in I was greeted by if not one of the most friendly staff I've ever met. Prompt service and makes me feel like a valued guest all the way. The room is very clean, nicely lay out and make me feel like home. Now if you staying here on a weekend or peak-tourist periods, you will hear kids. Door closed or not. Some running some screaming, but if that bother you or not is up to you. The bedroom on the other hand is like a standard hotel room but upgraded. Ceiling-to-floor window, comfortable bed and sheets. However if your room is facing the streets, prepare to hearing some car noises. Also the A/C unit can be loud. In my case it actually woke me up when it kicked in. However you can always keep it running to combat the outside noise but it's louder than comfortable level to sleep soundly, if you are a light sleeper.

I don't usually stay at places like the Embassy Suites, but with a young child, it was the most economical way to go as we needed a suite & crib. The hotel was apparently renovated, but it still had some major issues as far as I'm concerned. If you don't want to read a whole review, just remember this one thing: AIR CONDITIONING AS LOUD AS A LAWNMOWER The A/C unit cycled on and off all night, and sounded like a lawnmower each time it started up. Even the fan itself was incredibly and horribly loud. They may have renovated the furnishings, but this A/C is old and L-O-U-D LOUD! Here's my take on everything else: PROS: - Friendly staff - Not a bad breakfast, considering it was free. The first day, the omelettes were okay. The second day, they were inedible. But there were other things to eat, so it was okay. - Comfortable bed - Clean room CONS: - LOUD air conditioning...making it almost impossible to sleep - Drapes don't reach all the way across windows, so there's always some light seeping into the room. Unfortunately, this light was directly in my eyes at 6:00 in the morning. - Odd shaped room, coming to a point so you feel like you are staying in a slice of pizza (maybe this is just because we had a corner room?) - $19 for self-parking, plus another $10/day for Internet - Shower was just kinda yucky (not dirty, but looked very old and dingy) I would stay here again if it weren't for the air conditioning issue.

You did have to be careful going from room to room, however, so as not to get hit by the bathroom door. We appreciated the free drinks at the Managers Reception and the free breakfast. We typically went to breakfast at its busiest hour (8-9 AM), and never had a problem getting seating. The pool was indoors, which was good when it was cool. We ate at the restaurant Indulge twice. Try to sit outside by the fire pit. Laundry was free, which was great, but since there was only one working unit on each of floors 2, 5, and 12 (floors 3 and 4 were out of service), we spent a lot of time going up and down.

The A/C compressor cycled frequently and was noisy despite leaving the fan on all the time and wearing earplugs. The coffee was extremely hot. I was carrying two stacked cups to our room when the top cup tipped and spilled a small amount despite the lid, and left a nasty burn on my chest which is still there. I have never understood why the ES charges for the internet and local calls while the lower-priced hotels offer them free. The staff was friendly. I had booked online and checked the rate two days before the trip finding the rate was reduced from $197 to $170. It was past the cancellation deadline, so I called the hotel and they gave me the lower rate. Two restaurants I would recommend: Point Loma Seafoods on the waterfront had fresh seafood and very reasonable prices as noted by Rachel Ray on one of her shows.

My main criticism was the location of the internal doors, they were ridiculous. The one through to the bedroom was right next to the cupboard door where the microwave was, you had to shut the bedroom door all the time to open the cupboard door to use the microwave.

Check in was quick - we arrived at 1 pm, and our room was ready despite of the fact that check in time, I think, is 4 pm. Suite was a little bit dark, but I guess, all suites are like this unless you take a corner suite with the balcony. Room was clean and noise level is OK. I didn't hear our neighbors upstaires or in the next room. Location is OK - it took us 10 mins to drive to drive to La Mesa and dine at their \"Red Lobster\". La Jolla shores are 10 mins away as well. It was nice to stroll there in the evening. Seaworld is 15 mins away on I-5. Breakfast and happy hour every day are included in room price. Breakfast could be a little better though. Very limited amount of fruits and veggies. Only banana and oranges, and actually no veggies at all. No yougurt or cottage cheese. At least, Hilton Suites include those items in their free breakfast. Evening happy hour included all kinds of wine and coctails (with the show of ID and your room key), chips and salsa, pretzels and slices of pita bread with little bit of hummus on them. Indoor pool was always crowded though, with kids in particular. I booked this hotel because of it's indoor pool knowing that it can be chilly in SoCal in March-April. My daughter swam there, however, all days - in the morning and in the evening, but I coulldn't get it because of tons of screaming and splashing kids. But that's Ok with me, I didn't want to swim anyways... Pool towels were too tiny, but I guess, it's OK for the kids. Oh, and no robes in the room (just comparing it with Hilton Suites). Also, there was too much chlorine in the pool - I could't comb my daughter's hair after each swim... We haven't tried their restaurant \"Indulge\", but it looked nice in the evening, especially the patio with heated lamps, couches with pillows and fire pits. Not sure if we'll return to this place next time. May be if the prices will be cheaper. I paid around $150 per night.

I called down to ask if maybe there was still food at the buffet and they said it had already been cleared away. Two minutes later, they called back and said, \"Can I get the kitchen to whip you up an omelet or something?\" They brought it to my room ten minutes later, no charge.

The party basically turned the lobby/courtyard into a nightclub with all the noise. From our living room, the music was LOUD and with young children trying to sleep, this was a nightmare. We called down to the front desk and were met with the rude response of \"well, it IS New Year's Eve\" along with a very half-hearted \"I will see what I can do\". My wife was so upset that she went down to the front desk and asked to speak with the general manager. At this point, I have to really compliment the general manager (David). Seeing that moving rooms at 10:45PM was not an option for us, The GM listened to our request for partial compensation and graciously agreed. He was courteous, apologetic, and said that he had young kids of his own so he understood the situation.

We really enjoyed our stay there, and would definitely stay again. The rooms and staff were nice, the hotel was nice with a big, beautiful koi pond in the lobby that the kids liked, the free internet in the business center was helpful, the breakfast was good with an excellent selection (hint: don't be late, they close it down right on time), and the location was great - 20 min or less to all major attractions, including the beach. Lots of restaurants and a nice mall close by with a playground for small children. The few negatives are: the sofa bed was awful - it was ridiculously uncomfortable. The mattress felt like springs with a sheet on top. Every spring was sticking out. They really need to replace them. I had a relative staying in another room, and her sofa bed was the same way, so it wasn't just our room. Also, other Embassy Suites I've stayed in had a nice kitchenette. This just had a very small area behind the door - the fridge didn't get very cold, and there was no freezer, which was disappointing. Still, it was nice to have the sink, fridge and microwave, however, small. The pool is nice for adults (even has a sauna) but definitely not a place for kids to play, so if your family expects to hang out in the pool, this is not the place. It's indoors, and is just a small rectangle pool with no shallow area for kids to play, not even large steps to hang out on. Also, the hotel rooms could really use a shelf or two in the bathroom. If you have more than one person, there's nowhere to put toiletries, etc. other than on the sink. If they just stuck a shelf on the wall, it would really help create more storage space. Lastly, they could really use a little noise buffer from the lobby, like more plants. All the rooms surround the lobby, and even though we were high up on the Honors floor, the noise still drifted up when there was happy hour or a band playing. We were prepared for the parking cost, we just considered it part of the overall cost of the hotel, however, it's very inconvenient - three stories with no elevator and only one lane in the garage - two cars can't pass eachother, one needs to back out for the other to get by. The front desk had conveniently printed directions to every surrounding location, which was very helpful.

This hotel is within walking distance to several great dining and shopping options in the University Town Center (literally across the street) and bit further to the Costa Verde shopping / dining center. The free cooked to order breakfast was amazing. At first I did not know how extravagant I could (or wanted to) order so I started with a basic omelet (the seemingly most popular order) with your choice of meats, vegetables, and cheese. The next morning I asked for pancakes which were amazing. The cooks will pile on the sides unless you ask them not to. My only complaint was that at around 4:30 am I awoke to the smell of bacon cooking as the cooks were preparing for the morning, but breakfast didn't start until 6am. The best feature was the Manager's Reception featuring complimentary beer (good and bad bear, a locally brewed La Jolla Ale or Bud light), Wine, cocktails, soft drinks and pretzels / chips and salsa. The open floor plan of the lower level gives a great chance to mingle with other guests or to just relax and people watch (there is a hi def tv as well usually on a sports channel, sometimes on news). There were two TVs in my room, a King Suite, one 32inch flat panel in the living room and one large tube TV in the bedroom. The refrigerator had no freezer in my room, but there was a microwave and sink, which worked perfectly for left overs. In the living room there was a desk, a desk chair, a one and two seat sofa. I tried out the outdoor heated jacuzzi and the steam room. Both were very relaxing. Internet is $10 per day, so I used their business center which had everything I needed, internet and a printer.

There was also a fridge in a closet across from a separate sink - bar area. Didn`t see until 2nd day because the doors to the bathroom and main room open strangely and into the closet where the fridge is. The room was on the smallish side for 4 people - if the kids were older we would have to have 2 rooms as they shared the sofa bed. The sofa bed was uncomfortable for them so after the first night I requested a mattress pad which was brought up within 10 minutes. They were much more comfortable after that and no complaints. Breakfast included each day was pretty good - nice to have a bite without having to decide where to go. Some days the omelete station was the only hot food choice (with bacon, sausage, etc.) and other days there were hot trays with scrambled eggs, potatoes, bacon and sausage. The omelete station was open every day and the cooks are super fast. Less than two minutes wait for the food. Other choices were pancakes, fruit, cereals, muffins, bread, coffee, tea, juices. We ate in the atrium every morning and were not disappointed at all - we ate and were ready to go. There is a nightly cocktail reception which is also a nice touch. Premium liquor is offered as well as soft drinks and nachos, chips, etc. We found a place to sit and enjoy. Again - all included in the price of the room. Free internet room - great to have although I didn`t realize it until our 2nd last day. The kids found the pool to be fun and I sat with them in the hot tub which was nice. Can``t comment on the gym but looked in and saw a few machines as well as free weights as well as tv. The location is great - close to everything - ie Zoo, Legoland, Sea World, SS Midway, etc. Just a short drive to each and easy to find. Also a good restaurant in the hotel as well as PF Chang``s next door. There is a mall across the street - we walked over and ate at Cozymel`s which we all enjoyed. Ask the front desk for a list of restaurants nearby and they will provide a long one with distances to each and whether they are formal or informal and descriptions of each place. Overall - Embassy Suites was a decent hotel with a good breakfast and cocktail hour included. Our kids enjoyed feeding the Koi fish in the lobby and the glass elevators. We would recommend this place and would stay here again. Just make sure you have good directions if you arrive at night as we did.

I booked the room online through Embassy Suites' website and chose to purchase the \"Romance package\" in addition. The package included a bottle of champagne and a small box of See's candy. (I think it also came with robes and slippers, but I can't remember if that was standard or if it came with the package.) The price might seem a little high, but it was totally worth it. The boyfriend had no idea about the \"romance\" part and I wanted to keep it a surprise. I wrote special instructions when I made the reservation that I wanted the champagne already set up in the room when we arrived. Check-in was a breeze...the front desk clerk was very courteous and informative (those kind of manners seem to be almost non-existent these days) and told us about a complimentary happy hour in the lobby. They offered mixed drinks, wine, and beer, as much as you could drink from 5-7. We had a couple drinks and watched some football in the gorgeous atrium-like lobby. The room we were assigned was on the top floor, in the corner. It was immaculate and the view was incredible. Best of all, the champagne was on fresh ice and the chocolate and robes were all laid out. My boyfriend was so surprised he was almost in tears. I was ecstatic! I took him to dinner at The Melting Pot, a fondue restaurant in La Jolla, and we asked the valet guys to call us a cab. They offered to take us in their own hotel shuttle for free and even picked us up when we called after our meal! The pool was great, the spa stays open until midnight, and the sauna is exceptional.

You see I was woken up at 5:15AM by a brand new flat panel TV in the breakfast area blasting the news to all those suckers who happen to be sleeping on the sofa bed in the front room of the 2 room suite. If you have never stayed at an embassy suites they have an atrium that all rooms face so it's either really cool or really annoying depending on whether you are deaf or not. When I could no longer take the before dawn intrusion I did what most reasonable people would do, called the front desk. What I got is \"I will call and ask them to turn it down\" funny cause the lobby is what ,30 feet from the blaring TV. So I laid back down waiting for the peace and quite I expect at 5 in the morning. Gues what? someone turned it up. I must have cheesed them off by politely asking them to do, I don't know, their job maybe. I should be ashamed of myself for bothering them and just shut my yap, but funny thing is, I then got a bit mad. I called down again. \"I can still hear it\" \"sir I asked them to turn it down\" \"OK then why does it seem to be louder?\" \"(sigh) I will call them again\" Click. She hung up on me. I must have bothered her again I guess. So again I tucked myself under the cheesy velor blanket trying to recapture my dream. 15 minutes pass. No change in the volume. I heard every news story, every commercial, every Olympic fanfare (It was NBC). That was IT. I called again \"I will get dressed and go down there and turn it down myself\" Silence (from the front desk I could almost hear her thinking \"whatever\" ) Click she hung up on me again. So I get dressed and go on down (hey I was up on the 7th floor) and walked up to the offending TV. Not a single guest watching it. Just blasting to no one in particular. I see a staff member walking by and I ask \"can you help me turn this down\" and she barks at me \"we don't have the remote, we don't know how to do it\" and she walks away. What have I done to deserve this? I checked my breath and my zipper, my nose and my BO and I honestly don't know why I was getting them so upset. I was really really bothering them maybe I should just shut up go back to my room and pay my bill and leave them alone, you know give myself a time out. But hey, I am an adult, I have atayed at maybe 15 different ES and booked trade shows and meeting for a living so I am used to dealing with hotels. The good ones trya nd make their guest feel special, the bad ones, well read on. So, last chance, I walk up to the front desk \"Hi, I am the guy who called about the TV and the folks in the breakfast area says that they don't have the remote\" \"OK sir I just got here what is the problem\" so I repeat my sad tale and she say's to me \"what floor are you on?\" the 7th. She rolls her eyes in disbelief that I could hear it way up there. So she say's \"let me ask Ellen she took your call\" so she steps back and I hear some mumbling and she walsk back and says \"Sir Ellen turned it down herself she has the remote\" \"OK its still blasting, it's not down enough\" . \"Yes it is, sir it's our ploicy to turn the TV's on at 6AM and we can't do anything about it\" Now i am normaly a tolerant fellow who expects a bit of noise from other guest rooms (kids Tv's or just chatter from folks walking down the hall) but I surely did not exext to get \"attitude\" from the front desk for just asking them to turn down the volume. So I say to her \"It's 5:45, and I'ts been on for a while\" \"sir that's our policy, how long will you be with us\" \"One more night\" \"Sorry we can't help you\" I was flabbergassed. Why in the world would I make this stuff up. Do they seriously think I sit there at 5 AM waiting to complain about something. That I am making it all up or just over sensitive? Yes they do, yes they do because what happened next summed up the whole bitter exchange. I said to her \"I hope someone would please go over and listen to the volume\" Ellen never showed her face and her flunky just looked at me and shrugged her shoulders. So I grabed one of those \"tell us how we are doing\" cards and said \"Someone is going to hear about this\" and as I walked away I heard her say under her breath \"stupid\" I turned around and said \"what di you say\" and she say's \"I said It's early\" [--] lady. I heard it correctly the first time. Remember I am the guy that can hear a TV from seven stories up. She never checked it out, never smiled or acknowleged my concern and gte theis, as i walked away she called me STUPID. Thanks Ellen, Thanks rude employee who barked at me in the lounge \"we don't know how to do it\" and a big thank you to the front desk clerk who rolled her eyes ignored my reasonable request and called me stupid. Fianlly a big thank you to Embassy Suites La Jolla. I will never forget you. You know just how to treat your guest, Like [--]. Wow,and it only took me 229.00 to figure it out.

In the evenings he enjoyed the pretzels and goldfish, then after he was in bed my husband or I would run down for a cocktail or a glass of wine.

We also enjoyed the indoor pool - though it is small it was never crowded, even during the busy family weekends. I liked the fact that it was out of the sun, since we spent most of our days outside. My toddler would wake up each day and the first words out of his mouth were always 'the pool!'

Check in was efficient and welcoming and all of our rooms were ready, clean and comfortable. The front desk made sure my father (who is disabled),was appropriately accomodated. We enjoyed the breakfasts all together and though we were a large noisy group, the staff was cheerful and friendly also taking the time to visit with my father who wanted to show off his family. When we were racing out to the wedding location on Sunday morning, the concierge (Adam?) was extremely helpful in making an adjustment in our handicapped parking assignment, helped with loading Dad's wheel chair and walker and even printed out a map to the wedding location which saved us from getting lost on the way (like my brother :). This same young man also helped my parents considerably when they checked out the next day. There is a great business center that we used for some last minute communications and a convenient kiosk in the lobby to print boarding passes. Some of the family enjoyed the nice pool and steam room. Parking is a challenge if you mind paying $17 per day (ouch) - it is in the heart of an expensive area so it is understandable, but it can add up. Very nice upscale shopping across the street and down the road about a mile or two, more shopping (Trader Joes and Whole Foods) if you are staying longer and want to eat in.

Upon walking into the room, there was Living Room Area with a pull out sofa bed, a large ottoman, a comfy chair, a table with 3 chairs and a flat screen tv. Moving further into the suite there was a bi-fold door and behind that was a microwave, small re-frig and a counter top to prepare and store snacks. On the opposite wall was a bar with a coffee maker, ice bucket and a sink.................there was even a cupboard below for storage of snacks etc. as well.

To the right, across from the bathroom, was a large closet with mirrored doors, there was a shelf & rod for clothes, a suitcase valet, and an iron& ironing board. At the end of that hall was the bedroom, with 2 double beds, my husband and I had one bed and our 3 and 5 year old boys shared the other bed, there was a dresser/vanity with an ottoman.

The complimentary breakfast was wonderful with many choices, cereal, friut, pastries, bagels, donuts, yougurt, juice coffee and best of all the hot breakfast bar. Grab a small bowl and choose your own ingredients, hand it to the chef and they make it into a scramble or omelett, you also can have pancakes, french toast, bacon & sausage.

The location of the hotel is perfect as it is about a mile off the highway and isolated from any highway noise. The hotel lobby was recently remodeled and it looked like they were putting the finishing touches on everyone when we checked in. The check-in process was very easy and we were in our room in no time after a long evening of traveling. The room was pretty spacious for the 3 of us and included an HD flat-screen in the \"living room\", mini-fridge, microwave, and even a bar-sink. 2 of us slept in the king-sized bed and 1 in the pull out queen sleeper sofa. The sleeping arrangements were very comfortable as we were able to close off the 2 sides of the suite for a little privacy. There were a couple of complaints that we had regarding the room and one of them ended up being addressed while we stayed there. The a/c system was very loud when it kicked on and would definitely wake up a light sleeper, and ended up waking me up on a few occasions. The first time we used the shower it would take forever to drain and the 2nd person taking a shower would always stand in a puddle of water. After making a call to the front desk they sent someone up to the room and it was fixed the next time we took a shower. Our rate, as well as everyone else's, included the great breakfast that they put on every morning. There is a large crowd in the breakfast area every day, but the spread that is available was one of the best I have seen in a hotel and we were all very pleased. We ordered room service 1 night and found the food to be very tasty and reasonably priced. A major that we had regarding the hotel itself was the elevators on Sunday (our check-out day). Everyone seemed rushed to get out of the hotel at the same time and this created a huge line at the elevators. We ended up taking the stairs down because it would have taken at least 30 minutes to get down had we waited for the elevator.

We stayed in a 2 room suite. Here's a rundown: LOCATION If you're on vacation, we found this hotel to be in a perfect location. We were close to everything including lots of great restaurants. SERVICE We found service to be excellent throughout the hotel, including in the food service area. ROOMS We had a king bed in the bedroom. Two of my kids slept in the foldout couch. The third slept on a cot. The foldout couch and cot were too soft in my opinion, but my kids could care less. The rooms are spacious if you're 2 people, with 5 people you might find yourself wishing for more space if you spend any down time in your room. We didn't do much of this so it was of little regard for us. If the rooms have one design flaw it's that the microwave and frig are behind the door the separates the bedroom from the living area when that door is open. In addition, you have to open a pair of doors to open to get to the microwave and frig even when the bedroom door is closed. Typically the bedroom door is open so to get to the frig you have to close the bedroom door, open up the double doors to the frig/microwave area, then open up the frig. Following that you'd close all three. The rooms have been recently redone and look great. Yes, the 42'' HDTV in the living area is awesome. I watched a few minutes of the MLB all-star game on it and it looked great. I can typically find something broken, not working, torn, or busted in any hotel room I stay in regardless of the hotel chain. I tend to think nothing of it. After staying here I week I found absolutely nothing flawed in any way. Even the shower water temperature was shockingly perfect every time and never varied one iota during any shower. PARKING They charge $17/day parking for parking. Overall in this area of La Jolla I noticed that parking was a precious commodity at some restaurants as well. To me you either accept that before you book or you book your stay elsewhere. I accepted it from this perspective: I'm paying an extra $17, but getting a complete breakfast for no additional charge. For a family of 5, I've have paid $40 per day to replace that breakfast, unless we went to McD's every day and that would have gotten very old, very fast. Parking is tight if you try to park during the evening, it's never a problem during the day. Over the course of a week I had to fight to find a parking spot once. COMPLEMENTARY BREAKFAST Overall I thought the breakfast was great. The food was high quality. The omelette's were great, they had pancakes every day, french toast some days. The selection was overwhelming, if you couldn't find something you liked here, then your standards are extremely high for what is mostly a buffet. There's been a significant amount of discussion regarding the crowding. Here's the scoop, there are plenty of tables to sit at. You can sit in the atrium and watch Koi, or eat in the Coast Cafe (they don't do breakfast in the Cafe), or outside on the terrace. The problem is that the layout of the buffet is very poorly done. The cook eggs to order line is at times too long b/c you've got people thinking that's where they're supposed to go even if they don't want an omelette. However you can get anything you want without waiting in that line if you don't want eggs. I found short lines or no lines all week everywhere else in the buffet. But I do agree that there's alot of bumping and jostling going on when you're getting your food. You can avoid all the jostling and crowd if you get to breakfast before 8am during the week and before 9am on weekends. There's can also be a huge difference in the omelette line between 8:20 during the week and 8:29, for example. I spoke with the ass't manager about the breakfast layout. She said it's not a part of the redesign they're doing. However they have been discussing it and are going to look at possible options for making the food selection process flow better.

Breakfast Buffet was chaotic: * The breakfast area was too small for the number of guests in the hotel. It was a nightmare trying to get food. The line for the omelets stretched 15 people long. There seemed to be lines for everything and such tight quarters that people were constantly trying to get by you with trays of food. The food was just so-so. Good pancakes, though. Limp french toast, bland scrambled eggs, overcooked omelets, good crispy bacon. Potatoes consisted of nuggets of deep fried \"tater-tot\" things. * They serve Starbucks coffee in the coffee urns, but it tasted burnt most of the time. * They were frequently out of things like clean silverware, plates, bowls, milk, fruit. * Now Embassy is going to remodel all of the common areas in May 2007. They may fix this whole breakfast situation by making the area more expansive and efficient. I wouldn't go during construction, though. 5:00pm Snack Hour was kind of fun: * They only serve potato chips, tortilla chips, pretzels, and salsa. * However, they serve shirley temples for the kids and any alcoholic drink for the parents (including, for me, a Midori Sour). Coffee and tea also included. Indoor swimming pool was good and bad: * It was nice having an INDOOR pool since it was 62 degrees outside. Pool was clean and well-kept. * However, pool was small and extremely noisy. Tons of kids running around, screaming, making canonballs, splashing. My 2-year-old and I stayed near the stairs and we made do. I'm glad they had the pool because my son loved it; but I just wish for my own sanity that it was bigger so that the kids would be spread out more. * I did appreciate the fact that the pool is right near the elevators so that you wouldn't have to traipse through the lobby in your robe and swimming suit. Front desk people and concierge were really helpful and just plain nice. They got a crib into our room in record time. When we called to ask why the heater was only blowing cool air, they offered to send someone up right away. When we explained that our son was already asleep and therefore we didn't want a repairman to come and wake him up, they promised he would be very quiet. I thought that was cute. We still didn't take them up on the offer that night, but he showed up the next morning anyway, which was kind of nice. Overall, I really enjoyed staying here but would go somewhere else for breakfast.", "Date": "April 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Suburban Area of Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice Rooms & Setting!\u201d", "Author": "MisterBill48", "ReviewID": "UR7247146", "Content": "I initially had some concerns that the remodeling might still be underway during my stay, but upon arriving, I found everything to be very fresh and immaculate!

Very annoying if your business is global and requires extensive late night conference calls. Inexcusable for such an expensive Hilton property. 2) Mobbed Breakfast Area. This property clearly markets aggressively to get huge families on vacation from Latin America. Makes the breakfast area hopelessly unusable. 30 minute waits for everything. Even worse, there is no nearby substitute restaurant (a solution I have used at other Embassy Suites) 3) No hot water circulation system. Not a business travel problem, but inexcusable for such a premium property. Have to wait 5-10 min for the hot water to warm up all the pipes between the basement and the top floor before you can take a shower. Premium properties worldwide usually have a system that constantly circulates hot water on each floor to avoid this lag. 4) Inept laundry service. Was 2 hours late. But they also forgot to charge me for it. 5) Expensive and clumsy parking system. Garage is reasonably nice, but they want $17/day for it and they have to fumble around with your room number every time you drive in and out. And they also have trouble keeping track of your charges which requires multiple visits to the front desk to correct their cooridination problems. 6) Slow room cleaning. Rooms still not serviced at 4PM on some days. 7) Sealed Windows.

The ES suites arrangement always seem very generous to me in comparison to most other hotels. The entire facility was clean and well maintained. Service was very attentive.

Taking the advice of others, we requested a room high up and not facing the street. The rooms are a bit small and narrow. We have stayed at other Embassy Suites and this was by far the smallest as far as room size. The walls were pretty thin and although we had a stairwell on one side (no noise there) we were able to hear the baby and singing father next door for at least one of the nights. Having kids of our own we understood but it tells you how thin the walls are. The room had a weird configuration where the door separating the bedroom from the living room opened and blocked the doors leading to the microwave and refrigerator. We found this a bit annoying. We did like the Koi ponds in the lobby. All rooms have a window facing out as well as a window facing the inner atrium. This atrium is over 14 floors high with the pond and breakfast dining area in the court yard. The location is great. Right next to the 805 freeway and across the street from the University Town Center outdoor mall. There are all kinds of places to eat and shop there. You do have to cross a major street (almost like a freeway the way people drive so stroller pushers beware) and it ends up being about 2 or 3 blocks until you find any restaurants. The UTC area is quite fun once you are there. There is also a mini play ground near Sears and a bunch of fountains through out. Some very accessible to little ones who want to get wet. The somewhat frilly Chinese food restaurant PF Changs is right outside the entrance. A bit pricey for small servings of Chinese food but from the wait and valet lines you would think they were givng it away. More on the hotel. It does have a indoor swimming pool but it is rather small. More for taking a dip than trying to do laps. And it is strange but they put the jacuzzi just outside the doors in the outside with lounge chairs available. The breakfast was not bad but they seem to limit the omelets to just one type every morning. No custom omlets which I have seen at other Embassy Suites. The Manager's reception was the usual chips and salsa and drinks but what do you expect for free? I read a review about a watch being stolen but I suppose the best advice is not to leave valuables lying around. It made me a little anxious about the staff but then again why would you want to take that chance? There is a parking lot where you basically have to pay the $15/day to park. I really don't know what happens if you tell them you don't have a car or just park across the street in the mall. There are also some unregulated spaces that do not require an entrance gate so I don't know who monitors those. The parking thing always annoys me but I know about it in advance so what can you do?
