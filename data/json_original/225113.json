WiFI was not accessible and after initially being told it was a problem with my computer as noone else staying was having problems but me, the staff told me they have had issues with no WiFi for quite some time now. Maintenance did reset the router once and I was able to access internet for about 20 minutes only. Taking a shower resulted in 4 plus inches of standing water in the tub. The shower curtain was so long that you stepped on it while showering and it floated in the standing water and was grossly stained along the bottom edge from repeatedly being in stagnant water. The toilet backed up and I was told they could not find a plunger, but I could change rooms at midnight while my children were sleeping. Finally a plunger was found but toilet continued to overflow. I was told \"ok\" when I said I would go purchase my own plunger and take care of the situation myself. I was able to get the toilet to work for about a day only. Sink also backed up. Room had a recliner that required super human force to become upright again after reclining, thus you could not recline in it unless someone else was present to get you out of it. Carpet turned our socks black. Housekeeping ignored massive quantities of crumbs and never did vacuum them once recliner was moved. Only positive aspect was breakfast. Lots of choices.

I would not stay here again for the following reasons. 1. The room had a sticky substance on the floor and bathroom was dingy/shabby. 2. We were told we would have an indoor corridor room (we were given an outside room at check in) I had no idea there was an indoor corridor area at the very rear of the property until we walked around to go to the pool. 3. There were rowdy teenagers in the pool area so we were unable to enjoy the indoor pool. I could not find anyone at the front desk to express my concerns to and even called the 1-800 number for Choice Hotels to express my dismay with the accomodations. They also were unable to get anyone at the front desk to answer the phone. As I was traveling with two small boys I could not keep trotting up to the front desk area to seek assistance regarding the room concerns or the pool concerns. And since they were not in there and not answering calls I called the 1-800 for assistance. Choice Hotels continued to try to call the front desk and were unable to get an answer either. 4. The next morning we tried to eat breakfast but they were woefully understaffed to handle the massive tour bus crowd that was there and be able to feed my family. The staff was cheerful and certainly tried to accomodate everyone but there was a such a large crowd they simply could not keep up and it was truly wall to wall people in there. 5. I had difficulty sleeping as a large 18-wheeler truck parallel parked outside the room around 11:00 p.m. and its engine rumbled most of the evening. 6. At check in you can see there is a ticket office in the lobby, I inquired about purchasing tickets for some shows/events in the area and was told to come back in the morning but not too early. When I asked what was considered \"too early\" was told that I should not come until the box offices opened but no one seemed able to give me a time to return. The final analysis is that I would not stay at this hotel again nor would I recommend it to family/friends. We were able to find better accomodations for the rest of the week in Branson. As for location I am unsure as to whether or not this is a good location for Branson.

Stinky grody-mody stench, ripped old wallpaper, nasty carpet, and did I mention the smell? It's like they've oversprayed a floral disinfectant and instead of taking away smoke and other smells, it's only combined the two for a repulsive odor! Upon driving up, we noticed the rooms had outside opening rooms, not happy about that, but trying to remain positive. We check in and find out that were staying in the back of the property which has inside opening rooms, so I'm happier - until we get inside, then the smell hits me like a brick! Pee-YUCKIE POO! As we walk to the elevator I notice the 80's mauve/pink flowery pattern on the sofa and carpet. Once on our floor, my eyes immediately go to the wallpaper and it's unevenness and ripped places. As we walk down the dimly lit hallway, we find our room, insert our keycard and it doesn't work! My hubby has to drive all the way to the front to get the keycard fixed and in the meantime, were doing the pee-pee dance! Finally we get in the room and it was nice and cold! We remove the outer bedspread, and lay down on a pretty comfy bed, despite the stench!

'06 and will never make that mistake again. The only positive thing about this motel is the location. There are two buildings with the older building having outside entrances, not a good thing with ice on the steps leading to the 2nd story and nothing was done to keep people from falling. I slipped and my luggage went down the steps when I was trying to grab anything to keep myself from landing at the bottom. In order to use the pool, which is located in the other building, you have to again go down the icy steps, out into the cold, and walk quite a distance across the parking lot to the other building's entrance. We were in a room close to the street. This wasn't an enjoyable walk when you come out of the pool. The enclosed building which contains the pool is more expensive, but we weren't told you had to go outside to get to the pool when we made our reservation in the cheaper building. All of the rooms need updating and a general cleaning, especially the stained carpets and take other people's hair out of the shower . Breakfast is very limited and what is usually included in other continental breakfasts was being charged for and it looked disgusting and greasy. The other breakfast items were in short supply and my mini muffins were moldy. I asked other people at the tables if their muffins were moldy and they were. Also, our heater didn't work right room wouldn't get warm. When we called front desk they just hollered at us for complaning and wouldn't do anything to try to fix it or give us another room.

I chose this hotel based on three factors--location, pets allowed, and price. First, let me say that the price was great, and all the employees we talked to were extremely friendly. We arrived in Branson earlier than expected (about two hours before check-in). The nice lady at the front counter called housekeeping and asked them to clean our room next so we could check in early. Everyone who works there is so friendly and helpful. About the rooms--ours was okay. It really could use an update, though. The carpet is old and dark red, and ours had a couple of stains on it. The coffeemaker had not been cleaned since the previous visitor, as it still had coffee in the bottom of the pot. The beds and bathroom were very clean, and we had no trouble at all with the air conditioner. We enjoyed the indoor pool as well. The free breakfast was nice for us...we aren't big breakfast people, though. They had a nice selection of donuts, bagels, muffins, fruit, and cereal. (Of course, they also have biscuits and gravy, too.) The location is fantastic. I strongly recommend staying somewhere on Shepherd of the Hills Expressway rather than on Hwy 76. At certain times in the day, the Strip gets very congested, but we were always able to easily get to our hotel with no problems All in all, it's an okay place, but I don't think we'll be going back.

The carpet was filthy -- not only did it look bad, but when I was finally brave enough to take my shoes off, the floor turned my socks black. Ewwww. The recliner in the room was also stained and disgusting. The room smelled also. When we were going to go to sleep, my husband pulled back the nasty comforter to find his pillow had something on it. Either lipstick or blood or something that should NOT be there. So we called and they did replace it very quickly. The iron was broken, water went everywhere. The bathroom floor (tile) was also gross, as it had not been swept in a while it had hair all over it. The shampoo had been used as it only had half of the product left in it. Not that I use their stuff, but the point of the matter is the room should look as if no guest has been there before. Where the floor board meets the wall, it looked bad the paint was chipping. The suspended ceiling tiles in the bathroom were mildewy and moldy. It was an unpleasant and uncomfortable stay. The good thing about the place was the location was terrific, the people were all very nice to us even when we complained, the breakfast was okay. At least it had biscuits and gravy for free and the donuts were okay. The front desk people did knock off another $10 off our stay, so it was $35. I guess you do get what you pay for. If you go through the branson's quality inn site (not the corporate site), you can get it for $42 a night. We were terribly disappointed in our stay here and expected it to be better based on a lot of reviews.
