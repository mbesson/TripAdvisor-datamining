The reason we chose this hotel was for its central location. The staff were very helpful although some struggled with English. They helped with directions, provided a map and helped with any issues we had, which were minimal. The hotel as a whole looked and felt like Rome. Although the facilities were a little dated we really enjoyed the feel of the place. The breakfast was nothing special but was fine for us, what you would usually expect in a European hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, with a nice bathroom. There wasnt really a view only the road outside. Again some of the facilities were dated and we had to carry our bags up the stairs because the lift was too small. This didn\u2019t bother me too much and there are ground floor rooms if it was a problem. The location is what really impressed us, we didn\u2019t use any form of transport as everywhere was in walking distance from the hotel. In my opinion walking is the best way to see a city and this hotel is great for that. Other that the Vatican all the major attractions are literally all within 20 min walk away. Even the Vatican was only just over 1 hours walk away with the bridges and the castle on the way so if you can read a map try the walk to the Vatican, it was really enjoyable. The restaurants right by the hotel were brilliant and I would even go as far to say the best food in Europe, but that\u2019s down to my personal taste for Italian food. The hotel is a little more expensive than others but for the location it was definitely worth it!

The room itself was ok; a bit dated but no real complaints as we were not in the room much. The bed could use replacing, but we had no problems sleeping after walking around the city all day. The bathroom was fine. The entire room was very clean, and housekeeping did a good job keeping the toiletries stocked. The breakfast was excellent every morning, and the staff did a good job keeping the small space stocked and clearing the tables. There were a few things that the hotel could work on improving. We found it disappointing that our room's hotel folder contained a sheet that said guests had free amenities available to them, such as complimentary wine, chocolate or fruit, bathrobes, newspaper, map, etc. When we asked, we were told it was for \"special rooms only\". The hotel should remove this sheet of paper from the folder if it doesn't apply to the room. Additionally, on the day of our checkout, someone inserted a key card and opened the locked door to our room around 8:30 AM - without knocking. My husband, who was getting dressed, quickly said \"Hello!\" and pushed the door closed.

So, my husband, my three children and I had to get our luggage upstairs to our room ourselves. Our room was spacious but by no means posh and just barely clean. For some reason there was a yucky little kitchen in it with dilapidated cabinets and counter tops. Our beds were adequate, but the pillow situation was most definitely not. So we called the front desk on our first night to request additional pillows. That was when we realized that the desk doesn't pick up the phone after 8pm. When we inquired about pillows the following day, we were told the hotel was booked to capacity, and there were no pillows to be had. For what we paid for this hotel, someone should have gone out that night and bought us some pillows. The mattresses felt more like sleeping on cardboard boxes, as well. As for breakfast, if you're planning on eating any, better be there when they open the doors. Breakfast was \"served\" from 7-10:30, but on the days we arrived at 9am, most of the food (and all of the croissants) were gone, and not to be replenished. The location was good, if you want to be central to the sights. But in Rome, being central to everything means being close to nothing. And the photos on the hotel's site are very deceptive. It would appear that the entrance is through a beautiful courtyard with a fountain, but that's actually an interior courtyard. Our cabbie actually had a hard time finding the building because the true entrance looks more like a service alley. Not very welcoming at all.

The hotel's web site is very deceiving, it is not as pretty or as lavish as it looks. It was actually quite run down and the rooms were outdated and ill-equipped. Our room had a musty smell and several of us had allergies which were badly aggrevated staying there. We stayed in February 2011 with 4 adults and 2 teenagers in a Family suite. There was one double bed, one pull out \"armchair\" bed, one cot and one pullout couch bed. The pullout couch was the worst sleep I have ever had in a hotel, the springs actually caused me great back pain (and I'm only in my 20s!), it was a nightmare. I ended up sleeping on the floor because it was more bearable than the bed. We were cramped in the room like sardines. It was a very small suite. Don't bother staying in the Family Suite. We realized we had forgotten our camera in the hotel room the day we left the hotel. We called the hotel to have them hold on to it for us and they were completely unhelpful. They asked us to email them with details, which we did. We did not hear back from them for 2 days after which we called again. We were then passed from one person to another on the phone. No one seemed to want to help us and we have still not heard anything from them about the camera. They were very unsympathetic and very unhelpful. Terrible customer service. We have lost all of our photos from this trip. Forgetting our camera was a simple mistake anyone could have made, which we feel very stupid for. But it was maddening to know that it was in the room and that we could have easily had it back if the staff had been at all helpful. Positive: Big bathroom in suite.

It was incredibly noisy (and I live close to the centre of Edinburgh)The room was basic and although had a wardrobe had no drawers. This was nothing compated to the lack of hot water. We had 1 lukewarm shower in the 5 days we stayed here - the rest were cold. The bathroom had cracked floor tiles and the shower was so low it was almost impossible to get underneath it. There was damp on the ceiling above it.. The reception staff were not the friendliest and seemed surprised at the lack of cold water but then said it \"had run out\".

The smaller not-so-fancy restaurants in the neighborhood were consistently good as to food choices and preparation, all offering the typical Italian menu.

The hotel is in a great location in Rome, very close to the Termini subway, bus, and train station. Rome is a city where you can walk everywhere and the Domus Romana is easily within walking distance of most attractions. Our bedroom had a queen bed, single pull out sofa, and a cot was brought in by staff. The room was quite large, very high ceilings, and our two windows opened out onto Quattro Fontane. The windows also had black out curtains which were great at keeping out the light. Our bathroom was very large, tub/shower combination, single sink well lit with a large mirror, toilet, and bidet. There was an electrical adapter built into the hair dryer attached to the wall. The floors throughout the hotel are marble and you will not hear any noise from below you. There is a small elevator that holds four people which services each floor. Taking the stairs is great exercise as the high ceilings mean that the floors are not the standard height. Cleaning staff were quick to change the sheets each morning but did not clear or clean used dishes during our stay. The kitchenette was helpful and the refrigerator was quite large to hold anything we might have purchased to eat or drink. The cleaning staff were more than happy to provide us with extra towels which were large and soft. The breakfast supplied each morning from 7am -10am was delicious. As expected, there were no hot food items but what was available was plentiful and readily restocked by Nita, a very friendly Phillipino server. Pastries, a toaster, sliced bread, and panini buns were always available. Sliced salami and ham along with swiss cheese were available each morning. Coffee, hot milk, and hot water were available for drinks. Nita was able to make a delicious cafe latte if given the time. There were two dispensers of juice - pineapple and some sort of citrus drink, both probably made from powder crystals and not freshly squeezed. In terms of breakfast cereals there was corn flakes, cocoa rice krispies, and delicious granola. There were three fruit selections, pineapple slices, prunes and another one which I cannot remember. Jam, butter, nutella, and honey were all available. We ate indoors but on a warm sunny morning it was possible to eat at small cafe tables in the courtyard. The tables seated four people unless you put a couple of tables together. The tables all had tablecloths and cloth napkins which was a nice touch and were cleared quickly by Nita. Reception staff were helpful, especially Andre and David. Internet access through two personal computers cost 2 euros for 30 minutes. The reception staff were helpful by providing printed directions to attractions and we did not always have to rely on the computers near the reception area. There is a restaurant across the street called Berzatolli (sic) which supplied good pizza eat in or take away. A margherita pizza cost 5 or 6 euros. There is a grocery store around the corner on Via Nationale a couple of blocks down called Despar which stocks just about anything you would want from a grocery store. Towards the end of our stay the tourist season was just beginning to hit full stride and the breakfast room was becoming quite busy. Please keep this in mind as the room is long and narrow and can feel quite tight if busy.

The Domus Romana is a nice and very charming small hotel very well located even for us that are more than 60 years old. There are several small places to eat, have a beer or a glass of wine in the same street. Just around the corner there is the Via Nazionale, where you can find anything you want; shops, restaurants, a 24 hrs drug store and a small super market (all these within 1 minute walk). If you walk 5 minutes you are in the Piazza della Repubblica, where you can take the Metro, and you can go from there to any where because one stop from that station there is the Plaza Termini where you can take all the buses and trains to any where within the city or elsewhere. There you can buy a one day pass, that you can use to take unlimited any bus or Metro for one day (4 Euros) or the three days for 11 Euros. Along the Via Nazionale you can take a bus to St. Peter\u00b4s Square or any where in the city (bus stop 2 minutes from the hotel). The room that they assigned was clean, spacious, with a nice kitchenette, very beautifully decorated ceilings (wood work) but a little bit dark in spite of several lamps. There were some details in the bathroom like shower caps, shampoo and a nice pair of slippers. The breakfast room was cozy, specially in February when Rome was very cold. The breakfast included coffee,juice, bread, croissants, meat, cheese, cereals, yogurt, pastries, cake, hot chocolate, in a nice, clean atmosphere. The two persons that are taking care of everything are very efficient and discrete. You can ask for expresso coffee and immediately you have it. In summary you can start your day very well fed and spend most of the day until lunch. There was a toaster for the bread and I mention it because some one who wrote a review says that there wasn\u00b4t. They have internet in the lobby at a reasonable price and once I asked for a nice restaurant for my wife and myself and the reccomendation was good, although some how expensive. The cafeteria around the corner in Via Nazionale serves excellent spaghettis with shrimps (8 Euros) and a very nice meat with vegetables (14 Euros). There also you can have pizza, have a beer or wine. Drinks in Rome are 5 Euros every where (beer, soft drinks, wine). In summary the hotel is very well located, transportation is readily available very close to the hotel and you can walk any where from the hotel. 15 minutes to the Fontana di Trevi and from there you can start your walked tour to all interesting places in Rome. You can go to Plaza della Repubblica and take the Metro for Piazza di Spagna. Walk 20 minutes to the Colosseum, 10 minutes to Monumento a Vittorio Emanuele and so you are right in the middle of everything.

Be prepared for sore feet and legs if you don't have good walking shoes! The hotel receptionists were very polite and efficient. We put our luggage into the small luggage deposit as soon as we arrived and set out to see the sights. There are a lot of good eating places nearby so we were glad that the hotel does not offer half board. The continental breakfast was OK.

The Coleseum is a must do. Don't worry about the big queue's as they move quite quickly. If you have children they can get reduced entry fees to the attractions but you must have ID [passport etc.] to prove their age.

This was our first visit to Rome and I must say when we arrived at the street the hotel was on, my first thoughts where what have I booked! The street was dirty, busy with traffic and shops. We walked past the entrance to the hotel as it is set back in an archway. But I must say once inside the reception I was presently surprised it was very clean and inviting and the staff very friendly and helpful. There was very little in the way of attractions and local information brochures but they did supply the best street map for free. Our room was on the 1st floor overlooking the main road, which meant we did hear some traffic but the windows and curtains do block out most of the noise. The bed was a double and very comfortable, Sky TV in every language except English, good wardrobe space and a nice bathroom with a pretty good shower. There was also a mini bar in the room, they never complained when we filled the fridge up with our own beer and water. There was even free slippers and a good selection of goodies in the bathroom. Breakfast was included in the price, meats, cheese, fruit, pastries a good selection, the only downside was that there was no toaster. But there was plenty to keep you going. The location of the hotel was OK, it was pretty central to get to everywhere by either bus, taxi or foot. We are slow walkers and it took us about 15 mins to walk to Termini Station and about the same to get to the Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps. But if you don't fancy walking the buses are very frequent and an experience you must have. The drivers think they are Sterling Moss and speedy driving over the cobbles is not for the faint hearted. After reading lots of things about Rome, my biggest mistake was to think that people dress up smart all of the time. People do dress up in the evening but during the day, jeans and trainers are fine. Please don't sacrifice your feet by not packing something very comfy to wear. As a lot of the walking is on cobbles and up and down steps your feet do suffer. Recommends The one ticket I would recommend buying from the TI is a Rome Pass http://www.romapass.it/english/index.html. It costs \u20ac20 and gives you entry into 2 places of interest and a 3 day bus pass. The buss pass on its own is \u20ac11 and entry into the Coliseum is also \u20ac11 and you have to queue. With the Rome pass you walk straight past the queue put your ticket in the machine and walk straight in. Hard Rock Cafe - If you want to visit here it is worth making a reservation on the website to get a seat. We went on a Sunday night as I had made a reservation for 7pm, I know that sounds early but places close early on a Sunday. The place was packed and there was a 2 hour wait for a table. As with any restaurant that is popular it is worth making reservations ahead of time Open Top Bus - Walk up to the Termini Station and get tickets to go on an open top bus. There are many companies offering their services and you will pay around \u20ac16 for a day pass that allows you to hop on and off. This is best done on the first day so you can see where everything is. It is also worth jumping on when it gets dark as the sights look great all lit up.

The staff thought it was hilariously funny every time the lift doors would open and 8 - 10 guests would be standing there waiting. This was quaint for the first 10 times it happened but it soon got old. Another issue was the attitude of the staff, especially the front desk staff. They had told us upon check in that they had free internet access and a free car park. We parked our rental in the \"free car park\" only to find that when we claimed it that the free car park was actually 35 Euro a day!!! The free Wi-Fi access is simply a lie...it does not exist.

Finally the concierge was no help at all...they could not reccomend a Restaurant nor any tours.....they simply directed us to the brochure rack and wished us luck. One of our party speaks Italian fluently and over heard the front desk clerk and the Concierge making rude comments about every single guest that walked by the desk. she confronted them, in Italian, and of course they were dismayed at being caught. I would probably stay at this Hotel again BUT with the competition for travel $ in Rome I will look for something different on my next trip to the Eternal City.", "Date": "December 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cLovely Little Place\u201d", "Author": "Avila290", "ReviewID": "UR10971861", "Content": "The Domus Romana exceeded my expectations for a hotel in Europe.

The TV was great, they use the Sky Network and this allows guests to access many different channels and for the guest to select the language of the channel. Our view of the courtyard was pretty and the trickling water from the fountain at night was soothing. The Italian breakfast in the morning, which is included, was decent. It contained meats, cheeses, cereals, breads and juices. Workers were very pleasant and spoke excellent English. Only major complaint was that one night they held an event with loud music there and it didn't end until midnight.

We flew into Ciampino, took the number 3 bus to the Termini (6 Euro each) and from there walked to the hotel which we didn't think was that easy to find as it doesn't have a hotel sign up outside but once you find Via Delle Quattro Fontane the hotel is through an arch on the left. Reception will not allow check in before 2pm but you can leave your luggage and fit in a spot of sight seeing if you have spare time. As there were four of us we had two twin rooms. The first room was on the second floor (201), very comfortable and clean with a side aspect through two shuttered windows. The bathroom was lovely with a large walk in shower. The second room (504) was up on the fifth floor and was more like a suite with front and rear aspect, both with terraces. The bathroom was quite small and only a corner shower which wasn't at all powerful. Both rooms were more than adequate for our needs. Breakfast is pretty good with a selection of breads, cereals, pastries, meat and cheese, jam, tea, coffee, hot chocolate. The only thing we did miss was tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms and lack of provision at the hotel for a drink of any kind. If you return to the hotel for an afternoon cuppa you will be directed to the bar up the road. We even tried to organise a drink via room service but there isn't any (room service that is). If you are going to use the public transport system you can buy bus tickets in the coffee shop across the road. Buses are very easy to use, buy a 1 Euro ticket and you can use it any amount of times for 75 minutes (punch it in the machine when you get on the first bus) or 4 Euros will buy you 24 hours travel. You can use them on the bus and metro. Our favourite bus was the number 64 (go out onto Via Nazionale and turn right - you'll see the bus stops) which runs almost through the centre of Rome and stops within reach of most attractions including the Trevi Fountain (which is also walking distance from the hotel), Piazza Navonna and the Vatican. Be aware though that buses are mostly standing only and there seems to be no limit on the number of passengers allowed on - we were packed in like sardines. We found Piazza Navonna the BEST place to eat with a good choice of restaurants and always lots going on - artists, human statues, entertainers ...... Hope this all helps you if you're going to Rome.

The bathrooms are average, spotlessly clean, but the shower cubicle was a bit small. There is a nice basket of toiletries, shower gel, shampoo, soap, shower cap, even a sewing kit and shoe cleaner and the free slippers is a nice touch. The breakfast room is nice and the food was good, there was the usual continental selection, fruit, yogurt, cereal, bread rolls, cheese, ham, salami, croissants, cakes, toast and jams, biscuits, tea coffee, hot chocolate and juices, I don't see what else you could want. The hotel is in a good position, the nearest metro station is 5 minutes walk away at Republicca, the Trevi fountain takes about 10 minutes to walk to, good place to go for a stroll after dinner and get an ice-cream.

On the day of our arrival the air conditioning broke down and we were immediately directed to another 4star hotel around the corner. A very elegant solution. When we could check into the Domus Romana the next morning, we were very pleasantly surprised about the room: it was huge! The owner told us it was the nicest room in the hotel, with a living room and a separate bedroom, and even a small kitchen area. So if you have the chance, ask for room no 304. It has huge windows and looks out onto the lovely patio with fountain. It's located away from the street, so the room is very quiet. Breakfast was less elaborate than we expected (I'm being fussy but I did miss freshly squeezed orange juice and a morning egg...) but that was absolutely the only minor thing about the hotel. Staff was very friendly and the owner was extremely helpful and always smiling (even in times of crisis when the airco broke down). And as other reviews mention all sights and the Termini train station are very close to the hotel's location. I would recommend spending the first day(s) just walking around, not only to the big tourist attractions, but also into small cobblestone streets that bring you to the most divine cafes and restaurants. I do have to admit that we were pretty exhausted after 3 days of walking because of the heat, so on our last day we took taxis everywhere. (! Some extra advice if you take a taxi within the city limits: always check that the taxi driver has its meter on no. 1, which is the cheaper rate. No 2 only applies outside the city limits, e.g. when they drive you to the airport. Remember that you're in Italy and they try to deceive tourists whenever they can. I was lucky to read up on that and was actually laughing when a taxi driver tried to pull that one on us ignorant tourists. He quickly said scusi and changed it back to no. 1). Anyway yes, I can recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Rome for a short break and will definitely come back (after all, we did throw a coin into the Trevi fountain).", "Date": "July 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFantastic location, wonderful staff!\u201d", "Author": "sleepy510", "ReviewID": "UR8130523", "Content": "We stayed at the Domus Romana last week for 6 nights and had a wonderful time.

The breakfast buffet was wonderful there was a large selection that you can fill up on before you go exploring around the city. I wouldn't recommend a taxi if you can help it they charged us 31 euros just to go about 5 miles from the termini - so if your brave to save money, walk its not as far as you'd think ,we walked back to the termini for our return transfer back to the airport it took us about 5 - 10 mins to get there.
