Our one bedroom apartment was very spacious with full cooking facilities as well as a washer, dryer and dishwasher. Minimal amenities were included (cleaning cloth, washing up liquid, dishwasher powder). The apartment was also very clean and a good supply of towels and amenities in the bathroom. Along with other reviews I would agree the \"serviced\" part of the title is a bit of a joke as you only get service on the 8th night. But this wasn't a huge problem for us really. There was one massive downfall to the property and that was the huge construction site down below, I understand that they aren't responsible for outside works but a bit of pre warning or warning at check in would of been nice.

Although a little tired, the size and comfort of my two-bedroomed flat was more than adequate for two couples and small toddler. Kitchen was excellent and utility room worked well. Beds were comfortable and the position on top of the Bondi Junction bus and rail station and adjacent to the lovely Bondi Junction shopping mall was just ideal for my visit of almost two weeks. However, don't be fooled by the title 'serviced apartments' as there was little service to speak of! Apparently, my very good room rate did not qualify me for any more than once-a week service and this was really disappointing. Other complaints were a very poor air conditioning system that was programmed to only remain on for four hours at a time - clearly aimed as a cost-cutting exercise. This meant that if you went to bed at 11pm, you would wake feeling hot and sticky by 4am after the system had shut down and would be forced to get up, go to the lounge, and restart the system for another four hours. This smacks of penny pinching and is no advert for this property. There were other problems over the tough New Year weekend when the hotel is fully booked. Lifts were erratic and often out of order making it a long & crowded ordeal to simply get out of the building and there were times when the very expensive parking ($20 per night) was not available. Parking was also very cramped so beware if you have a car and you don't enjoy maneuvering in tight spaces! There is Internet access but at rip-off prices so get yourself a Vodafone broadband deal for one-third of what the hotel charges! This is the type of property that seems to enjoy such a good location that some attention to detail in management seems to be overlooked as it is constantly full with guests. It is though a perfectly adequate apartment complex with access to all of Sydney literally at your doorstep but it really needs refreshed management & a little less penny-pinching.

The bed was comfortable and the linens in good condition. The bathroom was spacious with a decent sized glass - doored shower. Security is good and you need a card to get to your own floor. It was very hot in February in Sydney, and it would have been good not to have the aircon turned off during the night, as it made for waking up stuck to the linen. In our time there, we only had housekeeping come in once, but it would have been nice to have had clean towels after a few days( however, I am sure if we had asked, they would have brought them for us, ditto toilet paper). As women wash their hair, a few extra handtowels would be appreciated. Our bedroom did not have a TV set in it, which was fine for us, but we did see a corner apartment with one in it, plus one in the living area. Next time, I will request a corner unit, which also seemed to have upgraded furnishings. The location of the Meriton cannot be beaten - right next door to the fabulous Westfields Mall, where you can find anything your heart desires, not to mention outstanding coffee and restaurants, and it's right on top of the train and bus services to the city and surrounding area. One gripe which does need to be addressed - we hired a car, paid $20 a night to park it, and over the weekends especially, we would come back to find not a single space available. This is because of the many buck parties etc the hotel hosts. This is all well and good, but guests should be guaranteed a parking, or given a number of a space no one else can use. It is not much fun circling around in the wee hours and then having to park your car on a ramp.

Meriton is primarily a property developer and not a specialised hospitality operator. This accounts for the property's appalling customer service from checkin to checkout. These people do not have a clue about customer service. Let's start with the positives about the apartments. The apartments are located in Bondi Junction which is a fantastic location adjacent to one of Sydney's largest and most modern shopping centres, Westfield Bondi Junction, and the apartments are right on top of Bondi Junction train station offering easy access to the Sydney CBD by train in approximately 12 minutes. Also there are regular buses to Bondi Beach. There are two large supermarkets located within the mall, Coles and Woolworths so you can easily purchase food for your apartment; the Westfield also contains some lovely restaurants, around the area where the cinemas are, offering great dining options for whatever your price range. The apartments are modern but definitely not 5 star luxury - I would rate the appearance of the rooms as being 4 star but just barely 4 star - barely making it. Finishes in these apartments are on the cheap side but still modern. Most rooms have old fashioned televisions. The fridges are modern around 7 years old and some are very loud. The apartments are furnished in a modern way and there is a fully equipped laundry and a dishwasher, stove and microwave etc, a cheap white kettle in the kitchen and there are dinner plates and cutlery etc so there is everything you need to cater for yourself. This saves a lot of money and avoids the usual $40 breakfasts you end up having to pay for in hotels. Tip - bring some hangers with you as you are not given enough in the bedroom - the bedroom has large mirrored closets. The complex also has a couple of tennis courts and a swimming pool. Parking is available - at an extra charge of course - $20 bucks a day I think. The internet is available in the rooms - corded not wireless. Charge is $18 a day or $5 an hour, your choice. The Meriton Serviced Apartments are all about saving money at the expense of their guests so toilet paper is bottom of the range as are the tissues provided. Even the dishwashing tablets they provide are the cheapest available on the market. As you enter the elevator to check in you encounter a nasty note pinned up inside the elevator which provides you with your first sign of the lack of Meriton service. The sign informs you of the draconian fees for checking out more than half an hour after the set check out time which I think was 10am. I think the fine was $50 for every hour [or part thereof] that you are late. Enter the room and you encounter more of their \"rules\". The apartment handbook points out, as others have noted, that there is a $100 \"cleaning fee\" if you leave the apartment messy. This is totally not on and causes great stress when checking out as on top of packing to avoid a large financial penalty for late check out, you have to worry about cleaning your apartment and even putting out your garbage!!!! [this is specifically pointed out as an 'offence']. This is truly appalling. It should not be the responsibility of guests to clean their room on departure - what kind of hospitality establishment is this? Also housekeeping should be providing spotlessly clean plates and glasses etc for every guest not relying on the cleanliness standards of other guests quickly cleaning dishes in a hurry on their last day before they catch their flights! The handbook also informs you curtly of the \"No Noise\" policy. That you can be thrown out immediately with no refund if you disturb other guests with e.g. parties or loud tv noise. Now I happen to agree with this as there are many families in the apartments. I don't object to the policy just the way it is worded. We are also informed that only \"registered overnight guests\" are permitted. So those hoping to get lucky in Sydney had better think again! The Meriton front desk staff have absolutely no interest in guests at all, they do not smile as you pass or enquire as to your day. On the contrary you get an irritated stare. It is clear that front desk staff have had no or minimal training in customer service. As for help with your luggage - forget it. It's every man for himself at this Establishment. There are no porters and when I asked for help with my luggage when checking out I got a curt \"We don't do that here\" response from Reception. Let's move on to the air conditioning. The air conditioning is on a 4 hour timer for the discomfort of guests (note this is intentional). In the normal Meriton apartments that are for sale or lease all around Sydney i.e. not their serviced apartments, the air conditioning is normal and operational on demand by occupants. So it's obvious that the Meriton Serviced Apartments have deliberately put a 4 hour timer on the air conditioning in their Serviced Apartments to lower their electricity costs. Once again this is disgusting and an example of their appalling customer service and penny pinching. The airconditioning will therefore cut out during the night and when it's very hot in Sydney this could be a problem. The apartment guidebook says that the 4 hour cut off \"can't be changed\". They're lying - it can be changed for the whole block they just don't want to change it. So those are the negatives. Having said all of that would I stay at the Meriton Serviced Apartments in Bondi Junction again? Well surprisingly, the answer is yes. Why? Because if you want to stay in Bondi Junction there is no alternative that's why. I used to stay in Double Bay but both hotels have shut down. I do not want to stay in the Sydney CBD so unfortunately, it'll be the Meriton Bondi Junction when I'm in Sydney. However, next time I stay there my expectations will be drastically lowered and I'll know to expect apartments without the service. I would recommend these apartments to families and individuals who want to self cater and who don't want to stay in the Sydney CBD [but want to be a 12 minute train ride away] and want easy access to the Eastern Suburbs, great shopping within a minute's walk of the apartments and a 10 minute bus ride to Bondi Beach.", "Date": "October 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cSpoiled a great night\u201d", "Author": "Agent21", "ReviewID": "UR46883191", "Content": "I stayed in a 3 bedroom apartment for a friends Birthday.

It was a great experience, and we'd go there again. The advantages were the low prices, mostly great staff, serviced rooms, the views of the harbour, being central to everything in Sydney, and having a clean and updated apartment with everything you could really need provided onsite; dishwasher, in apartment laundry, pool downstairs, and more. The downsides were small, but significant for light sleepers, like me: The timer shuts off after four hours on the air conditioner which woke me up for awhile, so that took some getting used to if you need the noise to sleep. They don't hide this fact, but I'd never thought to ask prior. In a way, I was glad they are saving the world with reducing energy, I just wish it wasn't at the expense of my ability to sleep! Also, we'd asked for King beds, and they had pushed two single beds together - which in my book, though not my partner's, was definitely not as comfortable.

They are very good value for money and a one bedroom apartment on their long stay package, booked directly with Meriton, worked out at approximately \u00c2\u00a375 a night. The location of the apartments is excellent and you can get everywhere very easily whether it be the City (20 minutes) or Bondi Beach (10 minutes). We bought a pink travel pass available from most /all stations on a 7 day basis which cost approximately \u00c2\u00a325 and this allowed us travel on all buses, trains and ferries not just wthin the city but also to the suburbs as we wanted to go to a superb seafood restaurant on Cronulla Beach called Summer Salt - try it!! The ticket is not only good value but it was hugely convenient for just hopping on a bus, train or ferry without worrying about cash. The apartment is located just behind the entrance to the bus station and is on the road for the exit from Bondi Junction train station (50 metres). The lift to the apartment from street level takes you to a smart Reception and then a further lift takes you to your apartment. Security is excellent as your key card only allows you access to the floor your apartment is situated on. The one bedroom apartment we had was spacious, modern and clean. There were all the cooking utensils you need plus a very effective fridge, washing machine and tumble drier, microwave and cooker. The sitting area comprised a large sofabed and a dining table with four chairs. There vi loads of storage space throughout. The only frustration was that the enclosed balcony had a small table and two upright chairs which were uncomfortable. Two equally cheap chairs with arms would have made it better to sit on in the evening with a glass of wine but hey - that wasn't a major problem. The bedrom was fine with lots of hanging space but a limited number of coat hangers. Again, lots of storage space and a VERY comfortable bed. The lighting was fine. The TV in the sitting room had a range of channels and there is also a CD and DVD player. There seemed to be lots of younger students staying at the apartments but there was also a mix of older people and families. The apartment we had was silent from neighbours, the only noise was from the traffic below at this busy junction but the double glazing did its job. The air conditioning was fair but not hugely efficient. For those who are active there was a well equipped gym, sauna and swimmimg pool, facilties which were quiet for most of the day. There is recycling areas for glass and cardboard and located near each apartment is a shute for rubbish disposal. The staff at Reception were fine if not overly friendly but check in and check out were efficient so no complaints. Bondi Junction itself has a wide range of shops and cafes and ATM machines are located opposite the apartment and also in the Westfield Shopping Centre opposite where you have David Jones with a great Food Hall and supermarkets Woolworths and Coles plus bread shops, butchers, etc. etc. Internet access at the apartment is expensive but around the corner at a student travel shop, internet access is \u00c2\u00a31.50p an hour. The apartment was very easy to keep clean and tidy and was serviced once a week with clean bedding, towels etc. Otherwise, nobody bothers you and it is very easy living just outside the centre of the city. We did all the usual touristy things but highly recommended is a day trip to the Blue Mountains and we also enjoyed a Hunter Valley wine tour. Harry's Cafe de Wheels (a mobile upmarket takeaway) is a must for superb pie, mash and mushy peas with gravy and is based at Woolamaloo (apologies if the spelling is wrong!). This place seems like a Sydney institution and is well worth a visit - a short bus ride from Wynyard in the city centre using your pink card! Also well worth a visit is the Fish Market where you can buy a platter of superb seafood to eat whilst sitting on the grass or picnic benches and enjoy. It gets very busy at lunch hours so it is worth choosing your time. It cost approximately \u00c2\u00a315 for a platter of lobster, scallops, battered fish, prawns in cream sauce and a mound of chips!! Tremendous value and in honesty the freshest seafood I have ever tasted. I wolud say the food overall was the best I have experienced and knocks spots off London, even London's top restaurants. I thought Jersey food ( in the Channel Islands) was hard to beat but Sydney managed it at both expensive and cheaper levels. We ate lots of seafood, Thai, Malaysian, takeaway and expensive restaurant meals and didn't have one bad experience. Even the food to buy in the supermarkets to prepare at your apartment is fabulous and the service is exemplary - not the offhand approach often experienced in the UK! A good option for a drink is Orbit Bar which is a revolving bar overlooking the city. Drinks are reasonably priced and it is a better and cheaper option than going to the top of the Tower. All in all, we had a great stay and the apartment was well located for travel everywhere. We didnt travel back during the day however which would be possible if you were located in the centre of the city but that wasn't a problem for us. It could be done but would have taken an hour or so out of the day and it is as cheap to eat lunch in the centre overlooking the Opera House and Bridge. Would we stay again at the Meriton Bondi Apartments, most certainly. Was it total luxury, probably not compared to apartments costing twice as much which seemed to be the case in the city itself. For a two week stay it knocked spots off staying in a hotel with limited space and was tremendous value for money, allowed us to have a relaxed two week visit to Sydney and had all the convenience we wished for. Highly recommended!! In fact, we enjoyed our stay so much that from now on apartments will be my first priority for consideration over hotels when looking at booking long or short breaks.

They sent someone up to fix this pretty quickly but we were in a rush for a business appointment and had to get changed whilst the staff took an eternity to fix the bed, frequently disapearing from the room in the process. This wasn't a major worry, however once we went to bed, all we could hear over the din of people milling about on the streets below, was the fridge in the kitchen which was seemingly trying to take off into orbit judging by the sound it was making. It was so loud we could hear it at the other sidde of the apartment, through 2 closed doors. When I investigated further I found out the reason was that the fridge was probably purchased prior to the moon landings in 1969. I've not seen a fridge that old. The bathroom and kitchen generally required upgrading and the windows were obviously not up to blocking out any outside noise. Despite this we required a second night due to a change of plans and didn't want to pack up and move hotels, so we requested another night only to be told by reception that they couldn't book anything and we'd have to contact their reservations office! (what's the point of a hotel reception then, to hand out keys?!) When I called the reservation office(why do they do things this way) I was told there were no rooms available that night, only to find out after we checked out and went to look on the internet for another hotel that there were a number of rooms available here. To finnish off the experience for me, despite this hotel not being in the CBD they still have the cheek to sting you $20 to park your car there overnight.

We paid 20% less just getting two subway stops away from the city. Meriton Bondi Junction is a highrise of two towers connected by a building housing a clean decent gym, nice quiet indoor pool and a green space on the roof, with tennis courts and picnic tables (no grill). Also under the building is an entrance to a small shopping mall. We stayed on the 8th floor of Tower I, Room #69 (the tower with the gym and pool downstairs). (The shopping entrance and a snooker table are located under Tower II). We arrived at 6:30AM and were told our room was ready for us...joy! Our view was towards Sydney's skyline and we enjoyed sitting on our enclosed balcony gazing at it. Pros: LOCATION is perfect to everything...train and bus transport is right under you, shopping, restaurants, The Bondi Junction Neighborhood Scene (lots of young hot people around), nice amenities, clean, the carpet and furniture are fresh and seemed new, washer/dryer in your room, excellent security, THE VIEWS!! Price, compared to CBD prices. Cons: Main complaint was the bathroom which was clean, but due to grotty grout seemed not so clean. Tiling could use a freshen. Also, there are drains in the floor of every bathroom, I'm told for ease of cleaning the floors, but they can sometimes smell a bit weird. Could use more mood lighting in the living room, expensive phone charges and the aircon is on a four-hour timer, which got a bit stuffy in the middle of the night after it cut off.

Due to my brother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disability, we needed a two bedroom/ two bath apartment - one that allowed us to support his needs as well as give him and my husband and I, privacy. We were told that the Meriton Bondi Junction had only a one bedroom/ one bath accessible apartment, but we thought we could make due with the two bed/two bathroom apartment after we saw the floor plan on the Meriton website. We truly missed grab rails in one of the bathrooms but had no other option since staying in a hotel would have put us in two separate rooms. This was not considered an accessible apartment, but it worked fine. We found the main room of the apartment spacious, and the entire apartment exceptionally clean. The beds were excellent. The kitchen was equipped with the supplies you needed for serving meals, which we did for most breakfasts and dinners. We were a bit southeast of the Sydney CBD, but with our car ($20 extra a day for parking in the garage), it worked well for in-Sydney exploring, as well as day trips beyond Sydney. . The Meriton Bondi Junction is an apartment complex that takes up a block. It is over a bus terminal and a garage, has a freeway in front of it, and a shopping mall beside it. Noise was never an issue and security is the most I have ever seen in this kind of facility- albeit a bit overwhelming when you first arrive (now where do I enter the building for check-in and which key makes the elevator move?). Having read on an earlier review that they had a wonderful view of Sydney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s skyline, I was a bit disappointed when we did not. Our apartment looked out over burned out lights of the shopping mall, the freeway, and Bondi beach, which is dark at night. This was my only disappointment. All else seemed great. They serviced our apartment once during the week, and even checked for anything broken or needing extra attention during the cleaning.

All mod cons, and an unexpected surprise when we discovered the Westfield shopping centre right next door - five floors of shops including the wonderful David Jones food hall where you could buy gourmet goodies for eating in with very little cooking involved. We loved this location.", "Date": "August 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New South Wales, Australia", "Title": "\u201cVery good except for the air conditioning noise\u201d", "Author": "Macdaddyn", "ReviewID": "UR5356761", "Content": "We have just returned from a two night stay at these apartments. The position is excellent if you don't need or want to be in the CBD. These apartments are built above the Bondi Junction railway station & bus terminus so it is very easy to get around Sydney by public transport if you wish. The one bedroom apartment we had was quite large, well appointed & comfortable. Our one gripe was the noise the air conditioning made when on. As it is winter here, we were trying to heat the apartment. There was only one fan setting (high) & it made so much noise that it was hard to even hear the television. We took to running the air conditioning only when we were away from the apartment.", "Date": "June 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "newcastle,australia", "Title": "\u201cloved it here\u201d", "Author": "philjaye", "ReviewID": "UR5047442", "Content": "We have just returned from a weekend stay here and thought it was fabulous and have allready booked to return.Could not complain about anything.We had a recently refurbished 3 bedroom apartment wich was lovely with fantastic views.Great pool , spa and gym.Also great tennis courts.My 8 year old had a ball.Shops just accross the road.I would definately recommend", "Date": "May 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cMeriton Tiffany should be renamed Faulty Towers\u201d", "Author": "Fiona610", "ReviewID": "UR4728350", "Content": "First up, I'd like to say that these apartments are in an excellent location and some have magnificent views. The apartments are modern and well appointed, however, my gripe lies with the Reservations staff/system and the reception staff. My husband booked two apartments 11 days prior to our stay - 1x3 bedroom and 1x2 bedroom as there were 10 of us travelling and had relatives with us from the UK. Our booking was taken and we were assured that our requirements for accommodation were able to be met. My husband was told that there was plenty of accommodation available at the Tiffany. The only thing they couldn't guarantee was that the apartments would be on the same floor. No problem. Five days prior to our arrival, my husband rang to confirm the accommodation. No problem. We arrived in Sydney at lunchtime and decided to call to see if the apartments were ready. They weren't, but I was told we could check in at 2pm. A few minutes later, I get a call from the Reservations staff to say that there was a 'problem' with our booking. They couldn't give us the accommodation we had booked and paid for 11 days ago, due to some mix up with the booking system. After plenty of stuffing around, we ended up with 2x2 bedroom apartments and a 1x1 bedroom apartment all on different floors. When we got to ours we were greeted with a gas bottle on a trolley, oxy welding equipment, power tools and the air conditioning compressor lying in the middle of the floor. Back down to reception. After about 15 minutes we were finally given another apartment on the 18th floor. This meant we had elderly parents on the 11th, relatives on the 10th and us on the 18th. We soon discovered that our key cards wouldn't work between those floors. Back to reception. When we got there, there was a woman in tears. She had been trapped in one of the lifts for over an hour and was quite distressed. Meriton Management, you need to lift your game. This sort of stuff shouldn't happen and you shouldn't be taking bookings for accommodation you can't provide. We have stayed here before and had no problem and found the apartments to be of a high standard. They are furnished comfortably and are cleaned very well. This time was just so disappointing that my confidence in their reservations system and staff will probably deter us from staying here again.", "Date": "March 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangkok, Thailand", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Location, Good Room\u201d", "Author": "patrick-syd", "ReviewID": "UR4158515", "Content": "We stayed here for 8 nights in late Feb-Mar 2005. I didnt know there was this serviced apartment before but I always like Bondi Junction since I was a student in Sydney. Since we will be in Sydney for more than a week so I decided to stay somewhere where we can cook sometimes and can do the laundry. So I searched for a good serviced apartment and we ended up here instead of those in the CBD. We need only a room for 2 but the first night we arrived, there was no one bedroom apartment available so we booked a 2-bedroom with Sydney Harbour view. This room was huge, complete with everything you need in your apartment. There were 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, kitchen, lounge+dining area next to the kitchen, laundry+dryer. There was enclosed balcony as well. Oh there were CD player & DVD player in the living area too. The aircon was weird though, it kept shut down from time to time! But overall it was really good value and excellent view of the Harbour and Bellevue Hill. Then the next 7 nights, we moved to the other room we booked, it was a Sub-penthouse One-Bedroom apartment with Eastern Suburb & Botany Bay View. The rate was the same as other One-bedroom apartment though. The name Sub-Penthouse was from being on the floor underneath the Penthouse. Nothing so special like it sound. This room was smaller than the previous one we stayed but it was still good. It had everything you need though there were no CD player nor DVD player in this type of apartment. They should have corrected what they have advertised about this though. The bedroom was good with a little balcony that we could see the Centenial Park & Aussie Stadium, very nice view. The bed was comfy that I woke up late everyday :o) There was another enclosed balcony at the living area too. We cooked breakfast every morning in our kitchen and that felt like being at home for us. One Sunday night, we even invited a few local friends for a dinner party in our apartment. That was lovely too. The location was fantastic for those who dont like to stay in the CBD. Bondi Junction CityRail station is under the building so it only takes 5mins to Kings Cross and around 10mins by train to Martin Place, Town Hall and Central stations. Beside the bus stops are on the ground level of the train station so you could catch the buses to Bondi, Bronte, Coogee beaches including Watsons Bay, Double Bay, Rose Bay. You can take the buses to Paddington(Market on every Sat), Oxford Street(Darlinghurst), and CBD as well. Next to the Meriton Tiffany, there were a few shopping centres such as Westfield Bondi Junction and East Gate(cant remember the name) with a few huge supermarkets inside (Coles, Woolworths etc). You can buy anything from there. The Oxford St Mall, with lots of shops and cafes, is also on the ground level just few steps from the apartment so it is really convenient to buy stuff. I really enjoyed being in this area! But only recommend to those who likes to stay away from the CBD but not too far and still convenient :o)", "Date": "December 2, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Meriton Serviced Apartments Bondi Junction", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d287072-Reviews-Meriton_Serviced_Apartments_Bondi_Junction-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html", "Price": "$187 - $601*", "Address": "<div class=\"blBox\">", "HotelID": "287072", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/e7/2d/30/exterior.jpg"}}
