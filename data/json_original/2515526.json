So we passed a couple of hours by walking around the grounds, which were beautiful, and eating lunch at the Trellis Restaurant, which was very pleasant. The hotel is right by the trolley but not close to downtown. The area is a little bit sketchy and the restaurants in the area are chains. I did find a good running route along Friar Road behind the hotel which was good because the hotel charges $5 a DAY for gym access. I found this ridiculous. The gym was just ok. The TVs were old school and the remote did not work anyway. The hotel internet in the Royal Palm Tower was not a strong signal (I was on the 9th floor) but better in the conference rooms. They initially tried to charge us a daily internet fee but quickly recanted. The maintenance staff was prompt and very helpful. The Trellis Restaurant's waitress I had each night for a glass of vino was absolutely the highlight of my stay here. The deli staff was disgruntled. The room itself was a bit dated and the coffee machine had no pot. The bathroom was not super clean but acceptable. For the nightly rate I would have expected more.

This property is in some ways very impressive: two swimming pools, a hot tub, a variety of places to eat, a day spa, a conference center on site. If you are attending a conference at the center, I would strongly recommend staying at the hotel: you will get a discounted rate, and the convenience adds a great deal to the value. Even so, there will be some things to be prepared for. There are two different sets of rooms at the Town and Country: one set is in older style, rambling buildings, only two stories tall. The others are newer, and in more modern towers. The older rooms are small, and over furnished. The \"English country\" style chosen is overbearing and the furniture leaves the rooms cramped even when they use double beds instead of the more common queen beds. With that, let's talk about the place. THE GOOD The staff is incredibly helpful and friendly. When you call for more towels, help with the HVAC, etc, they are there promptly and get things taken care of. This speaks well for the establishment, all the way around. The restaurants are clean, well-lit, efficient, and the food at the Terraces cafe is quite good. I will recommend the breakfast buffet there - it is a good value for the price. They have hit the sweet spot between variety of foods and price, at least for me. I've already mentioned the convenience if you are staying for a conference. They are also very convenient to all of the San Diego attractions. The property is right off the 8, and very close to the 163. THE BAD: I've already mentioned the cramped rooms in the older part of the hotel. There were three of us sharing two double beds: my husband, me, and our 14 year-old daughter. It is a good thing I am short (5'1\" if I'm standing very straight) because otherwise he and I wouldn't have fit into the double bed provided. The furniture left very little room to live out of a suitcase, which is common for a weekend or other short stay. There is a shortage of convenient parking, at least for the rooms in the older section. I had quite a hike from the car to the room with our luggage. Thank goodness for luggage on wheels! There appears to be plenty of parking, you just have to be willing and able to walk a ways to get to your room. The property clearly does not cater to the \"connected\" crowd. While they have wireless internet, it does not reach all the rooms. Our room was not at the edge of the property by any means, but we could not connect to the internet from the room. We had to go outside, to a gazebo, to be able to connect to the internet. This is a real negative for us. THE UGLY While the English country look was popular in the 80s, it is less so now. The property is well cared for, but the juxtaposition of box hedges and banana trees is jarring. Originally, it appears that the Town and Country was built when the South Pacific was the most romantic getaway (did it ever really stop being that?) and so many of the buildings have the curved roofs reminiscent of a tropical island hut. The pool courtyard was done up to resemble a European garden courtyard, but the buildings around it were round with the curved shake roofs of the original \"tiki hut\" style. This may or may not be a negative in your book, but it does give one pause. If the owners are this confused about the decor, what else are they confused about? All in all, an acceptable place to stay, especially at the reduced rate. You won't find better rates this close to town with this many pluses without having frequent visitor status.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cinteresting hotel\u201d", "Author": "MSURocks1", "ReviewID": "UR126625394", "Content": "this is a big hotel of a different era (as noted by other reviewers)....while dated the place is clean but it's unfortunate little details seem to be a problem for much of the staff.

Deli - opposite of the above servers...popped in to grab a quick drink (pepsi) but no staff was found, after a few minutes I began to call out - no one answered, finally after at least 10 minutes (yes I did start to time it) someone showed, no apology, no energy he was just \"there\" Sports Bar - see Trellis, great servers This hotel does tend to nickle and dime a bit, charges for Internet (like most full service hotels so I expect that) charges for parking (again like a lot of hotels but that doesn't mean I like it) but the one I do mind is the daily charge to use the gym.....I can't think of the last time I had to pay to use the gym at a hotel Be Warned - \"daily\" does not mean any day that ends in a \"Y\" at this hotel!!!

Knowing that this place would be packed for the conference, I made a reservation 2 months ahead, thinking that I could get a better room. When I made the reservation, I reserved a room in the Royal Palm Tower, which is supposed to be the biggest room with two quenn bed, nice view, and a balcony. However, when I got there, although the front desk told me that I had a two-quenn bed room, when I got to my unit, I found it in a complex (not the tower that I reserved) under a stair case, no view, with two double-beds instead. The beds were not comfortable to sleep on. Since the place was packed with two conferences going on at the same time, I did not ask for a different room, which was a mistake. In addition, the hot water boiler was way over the other side and it took forever just to have loop warm water. When we checked out, I mentioned to the front desk and was told that there was nothing they could do and that queen beds were available \"on requests only\", which I thought I did. It's not like I was asking for compensation or anything. A heartful apology from the manager would've done it. In addition, this place did not have enough parking space to hold two conferences at the same time and we were having hard time finding parking space after we went out for lunch. The last day of the stay, we went to one of their restaurant there to get a bite before I had to go and do my presentation. The place was full of people but only with one waitress. We had to ask three times and it took 20 minutes before the second waitress finally showed up. By the time the food got to our table, I had to leave for my presentation. You would think that the management would realize that there were two conferences going on and schedule more people in those restaurants. Obviously this place only cares about the money and not the customer services. I would not go back there again. And if the conference is going to be held here, I would not go to that conference.

I stayed for a week in February 2012. I wasn't sure what to expect from reading the reviews but soon found out that for the most part the reviews were pretty honest. Some of the best parts were the conference center,with the exception of \"the meeting room\" I belive it was sunrise, the building smelled horrible and was musky and old...the staff was very good and the food we had during our meals was awesome!. The grounds were amazing and great to look around. I ate breakfast at the cafe and it was ok, the fruit was awesome, the staff was really good, I had a cup of coffee in front of me within minutes of walking through the door even if they were busy...was to over priced for what you got. The bellman group was also very helpful and good...they did an incredible job. It was quick to tell that the training between them and other groups in the hotel must be done by different people as the level of service is not consistent. The rooms as mentioned in other places are outdated, small things could be done to make it better but they just are not taken care of. In my room the bedspread and curtains were very old and were either very cheap or worn out. The bed was very firm, I happen to like firm beds but could see where some people would have a problem with it. The housekeeping staff is not consistent or even very good for that matter, they need to learn how to dust, the tv stand, picture/mirrors, desk, and the curtain thing above the bed all had dust on them. Each day the room was left in a different state of cleanliness. The mirror in the bathroom was never clean and had what appeared to be toothpaste splatters (not mine) on it and the frame... I did call and request a room service menu but never got it not sure who was supposed to bring it but I figured if they didn't want to give it to me they must not want me to use the service. I did notice that for the people that did get to use room service their plates and dishes were allowed to sit on the floor for hours sometimes over night...I know on one day breakfast dishes were left on the floor by the elevator from around 11:00 in the morning until the next day. Overall I enjoyed my stay and the conference(didn't stay in my room much). I am not sure I'd say here again although I do plan to attend the same conference, I did check out a couple of the nearby(walking distance) hotels while I was there for future reference, they were not only cheaper but appeared to be much nicer, more updated, and offered better services. I enjoyed the $60 hotel I stayed in before I flew out to S.D. much better. If you are staying here for a conference might be ok for you, you might want to check out the other options that are right beside this hotel...not sure I'd stay here if I was just vacationing.

Several people brought the reviews to my attention, which of course freaked me out. I ended up booking another hotel as well, just incase this property was as bad as some of the reviews. Well, long story short, I think things have changed, because I ended up canceling my backup, and spending the week at t&c. Service was excellent, the staff couldn't have been friendlier. We were allowed to check in early, and given a room in the back tower. Parking was also reduced to 5 a day, which was much easier to swallow compared to the normal 14. Our room was very clean and nice. I was actually so surprised by how nice it was I began calling and texting others that knew I was worried about it. The property grounds were very beautiful that for time of year. My only real issue were the on site restaurants, their quality and price points. We ate as a group one evening at Trellises and found the service to be very slow and the food quality to be five out of ten, despite a very expensive menu. We at The Terrace every morning and found it to be very expensive with the quality being near or less than Denny's. Aside from the food, we had an exceptional time, and hope our convention returns there next year. I think changes have been made and continue to be made, nd as such T&C is now one of my favorite SD places to stay. I would like to see the room prices a little lower, they seemed expensive compared to others near it.

I'ld like to recognize Jose Cabrillo, at the Trellises, as we found Jose to be professional, most accomodating, and very pleasant at his job. We also met a very friendly spanish gentleman, Danny, who provided \"room service\" delivery on a 3-wheel bicycle. We found him very interesting, and he was just happy being of service at Town & Country. Very nice gentleman. Service is everything and they surpassed our expectations. We have stayed at the Town & Country many times over the years, but I want to take the time to compliment this resort for their beautiful grounds, flowers, exquisite landscaping, and very clean buildings. I read a review where a gentleman wrote some negative comments recently. I personally feel some folks can simply not be pleased. I do not agree with his comments. I assure you this location is most lovely, relaxing, and after five nights, we were truly saddened to depart and return to South Carolina. I cannot say enough good about the bungalow. We will make a point to stay in the bungalowes from this point on. Our room was large and comfortable, our bed was a king sized four poster bed, and we had a lovely garden view that was just stunning with lovely roses and Bird of Paradises everywhere. Amazing. The hotel location is adjacent to a fun mall that you can easily walk to by crossing a small bridge at the rear of the property (at parking lot). The property is in close proximity (approximately 1-2 miles) to Old Town for great food and shopping, and the best beach in San Diego \"Mission Bay\". Sea Port Village shopping is an experience all it's own, the Convention Center is very accessible, and the famous Zoo is world class. Personally, I think the Town & Country is a perfect location, with easy on / off driving to Interstate 8, Interstate 5 , or Freeway 163. There is also a trolley at the mall area for easy-to-use public transportation. We feel the property only makes great sense, and when you get into the resort property you feel you have gotten away from the feel of the big city. It's very relaxing. The pool area and spa are great, with lot's of room to enjoy the out of doors, and the weather in San Diego is absolutely perfect.

The line for the cafe went out the door and around the pool, they would only help one guest at a time and wait for their coffee to be made. Our room was extremely small with an old tv, and smelled like it was 100 years old. They need some fresh air. The nicest part of the \"resort\" is the convention area, which has been mostly renovated. The rest is a 60s flashback. There are no hallways and the whole place is motel style. You have to pay for wifi and the gym. There is no complimentary breakfast. All of the restaurants served on dirty looking cups/plates and smelled gross. Our convention had paid for breakfast, which was 25$ per person per day. I am very happy I didn't pay for it, all we got is hard sausage and watery eggs. Although the property is in bad condition, the guest service is very good. We were satisfied with the maid service and the bellhop was very good with driving us around.

I was rooming with a business associate who'd reserved the hotel room for the World Fantasy Convention the last week of October. Despite the fact that I was named on the reservation, the hotel front desk not only wouldn't let me check in until my associate got into town over five hours later, but was completely unconcerned when I told them I was about to have back surgery and needed to lie down after a seven hour flight. After my associate arrived, the damage was already done and I spent five days in absolute misery. The hotel pool did not have clear hours posted--in fact the only posted hours were next to one of the three entrances to the pool area and in complete shadow. So the first night when we went in to the pool to swim unknowingly after the pool was closed, we were alarmed to be confronted by armed security guards with their guns out. Then, despite trying every restaurant on the resort property, we received horrendous service in every one. In the bar designated as the convention bar, only one bartender was on duty. Not only was he slow, but he was also rude and incapable of keeping the bar or tables bussed. The low point of my experience came upon discovering that a gift basket had been sent to the resort for me on Thursday, October 27, and that the hotel not only didn't bring me the package, but didn't even bother to tell me it had arrived. I found out on my own (October 30) when the sender asked if I hadn't received it. A busboy drove me to the package room in a golf cart--much appreciated--and once I finally got to where the gift basket was, I was charged a five dollar handling fee. Yep--charged FIVE DOLLARS for NOT receiving a package. I found this experience to be the signature attitude of the hotel and its staff (excepting one bellman, one server, the maid service in our room and one front of the house manager) throughout the whole of my stay. No one seemed to care that the entire hotel was providing NO service at all. This hotel was an unmitigated disaster, and the entire business convention ruined as a result of their lack of care for their guests.", "Date": "November 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Appleton, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cWisconsin travelers\u201d", "Author": "Muffy V", "ReviewID": "UR120254379", "Content": "A very nice stay--very clean and well kept grounds--close by shopping mall and restaurants", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montclair, California, United States", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay\u201d", "Author": "Tanya T", "ReviewID": "UR120252766", "Content": "We were only there overnight for a business meeting and had a great experience.

I wanted a late checkout. They gave me 1 hour. Seriously. One hour. 'Are you sold out?' I asked. No. If they had been, they said, they wouldn't even give one hour. It was hotel policy. I asked for the manager, who may actually have been the same person because she brusquely repeated the same thing. All resorts charge, she said. No, actually they don't. I was at the Ballantyne in Charlotte recently, where they were perfectly gracious about it. (And that really was a resort.) 2.

The room lighting was really poor: two table lamps for a fairly sizable room with darkish decor. One had a loose contact. 5. No fridge in the room. Even motels have those. 6. The place felt a bit rundown, like a large estate whose owners have fallen on hard times. The convention was great, and a lot of things did work. I got the impression that the grounds-keepers, the bell-staff, the house-keeping staff are pretty good. The restaurants are understaffed (after hearing from other people at the convention, I completely avoided them except for the breakfast mentioned). And the front desk -- understaffed, under-trained, and with no understanding of what \"hospitality industry\" means. I understand that having a thousand people flooding in over a weekend can strain the system -- except, that's what this hotel DOES. Conventions. There was a geothermal convention before, and some church group after. They should be geared for tidal waves of guests, and they clearly are not. The other thing they seem not to recognize is that at conventions, word spreads. If a guest is unhappy, a hundred people know about it the same day. My own satisfaction with the hotel was adversely affected by the negative experiences recounted by my colleagues.", "Date": "November 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, AZ", "Title": "\u201cWhatever Happened to the Town & Country?\u201d", "Author": "JeanneTGC", "ReviewID": "UR120043897", "Content": "I want to preface this review with some past history. In the mid-to-late '80's and the early '90's, my family and I used to go to San Diego for vacation at least 4-6 times a year, sometimes more. We stayed at the Town & Country 9 times out of 10. We LOVED this hotel. We've stayed there a few times since on San Diego trips -- have loved it still. I did then and have up until this last trip recommended the Town & Country to anyone asking me where to stay in San Diego, confident that I was recommending the best hotel experience at a great cost. So imagine my shock and dismay when I discovered that while the Town & Country still looks the same, it's gone downhill faster than a top skier at the Olympics. World Fantasy Con was at the T&C this year. That's 1,500 people, at a convention hotel that presumably can handle many more, since they weren't at capacity by any means. I could literally write an entire novel about this experience, so I'll list the \"highlights\". 1. The hotel refused to allow my roommate -- who has been on my reservation for 6 months, AND who, listed on the reservation, would be in either pre- or post-op from back surgery -- to get into our room before I arrived. She asked them to call me while I was on the road -- they refused. She offered to pay for the first night -- they refused. She was told they had to have my credit card and ID physically in their possession. They hadn't needed this when I made the reservation, but now, now it was vital. When she mentioned she was pre-surgery and by doctor's orders needed to be lying down for 50 minutes out of every hour, she was told this wasn't the hotel's problem and ignored. Ergo, she spent 5 hours outside on a pool chaise. Yes, it's San Diego. But at the end of October the Southwest gets cold, and it was indeed cold. And did I mention she's about to have back surgery? Yeah, great way to start your convention. 2. Service was abysmal. The bartender at Trellis' didn't know how to make drinks. Or clean glasses. Or clear tables. Neither did the 1 or 2 cocktail waitresses that were occasionally around. If you got good service from someone at one meal, said good service wasn't repeated the next time you saw this staff member. As near as we could tell, the staff were all working 11 and 12 hour shifts, doing several jobs, and therefore, none of them well. 3. Food was average to awful, and the restaurants ran out of staples like vanilla ice cream and mushrooms. There are 4 restaurants on site -- what property with that much food service runs out of vanilla ice cream, particularly when there's a convention? Especially when there were conventions immediately before, concurrent, and immediately after ours. 4. Everyone's a supervisor if they think you're unhappy. Every single time we asked for a supervisor, the person we asked always said, \"I'm the supervisor.\" Either the entire staff is \"in charge\" at the T&C, or they've learned how to avoid getting complaints, by taking a complaint about their own awful service and not sending it up to management. 5. The beds are like slabs of concrete. I know some people like this, but no one I spoke with happened to be among this group, myself included. I realize upkeep on a large convention hotel is costly, but when your average Best Western has better beds, you know it's time to invest in a decent set of mattresses. 6. Complete lack of interest in guests' needs, enjoyment, etc. I've never stayed at a hotel of this size where literally no one gave a damn about whether or not the guests were happy. We were not happy, and it was obvious, and stated many times, and yet almost no one cared. 7. We were charged a \"handling fee\" for a package that was sent to our room. Only, we never got it. We only found out that a package had been sent to us on Thursday when the sender called on Saturday to ask if we'd enjoyed the gift. Upon searching, we were able to get our package, which was clearly marked. They didn't have change for a $20, though, so that had to be charged to our room. No one cared that they'd had a package of perishable items for 3 days without even trying to deliver it. It wasn't their problem, which is what we were told. 8. Pool hours are not clearly marked, especially if you're trying to go to the pool at night. Which we did. We were the only people in the pool because it was late at night, but the pool's location has excellent acoustics so we were discovered by two armed guards. How do I know they were armed? They had their guns out as they came to, I guess, shoot us out of the pool, since we were there after hours. After giving two dangerous women a stern talking to about how we were pool hours rule breakers, and after we explained that, since there were no signs anyone other than Superman could actually see, and asking if the pool was really off limits, why the heck were all the doors without pool hours signs on them open, they went of to protect the property elsewhere, guns at the ready. 9. The \"hostess\" at Kelly's Steakhouse refused to put two 4-tops together so my party of 7 could eat together. She told us to go to their bar and turned her back on us. We went into said bar. The hostess then sent about 20 more people in after us. The ONE waitress for the bar was, unsurprisingly, overwhelmed. The restaurant never sent in another server. One of our meals wasn't put in, and when it finally arrived, 1 minute before we were leaving, it was so well done it was like shoe leather. I could go on. And on. And on. Let's look at the few, far too few, positives. 1. Housekeeping was awesome. Our maid (Josephina) was excellent -- possibly the best, most consistent maid service I've had in years. Housekeeping was quick to handle requests and pleasant while handling them. 2. The grounds are still lovely, lush, and well maintained. Same for the pools. And the whirlpool. 3. Some servers heroically managed good service at least one time each, so I can point to a lunch at Trellis' (Angelica), a lunch at Terrace Cafe (Andrea), a drink at Trellis' (F&B manager, who, due to circumstances we were in at the time, we weren't able to take aside and speak to about our many issues with his staff), a front desk clerk (Jeremy), and the night manager (who was on, literally, her last night on the job when we spoke to her and shared all of our dismay) who all managed to give us some good customer service. Our most enjoyable meals, other than the ones where a T&C employee managed to give us the kind of service you expect at a resort/convention hotel? They were at Pam Pam's Restaurant and the Valley Inn Coffee Shop on the other side of Hotel Circle. Those are attached to the Day's Inn and the liquor store, respectively. But their food was good, their service excellent, and they were actually happy to see us and our money. And they weren't understaffed, and all of our food arrived at the same time and cooked perfectly. Go figure. Speaking of going, I'm saddened to say that I doubt I'll willingly go to the Town & Country ever again. Which is too bad, because I'm back to going to San Diego regularly again. But since all my fond memories are tainted by this experience, I don't want to taint my family's memories, so the Town & Country is off our list and we'll talk of it in the past tense from now on.", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winslow, Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cGreat Staff, Great Location, Great Place\u201d", "Author": "Linda O", "ReviewID": "UR119928150", "Content": "The staff were wonderful!

The property appears to be an aggregation of a number of older properties, and rooms range from one to two story motel type rows with either parking (at the front of the property),or a large courtyard (mid property) out front, to a tower with outside walkways (back of the property). The ones with parking out front are subject to noise of passing guests and vehicles. My room was one of the former and was quite OK (except for noise), even a bit more \u2018homely\u2019 than your average conference hotel. Beyond the parking areas are nice gardens, courtyards and walkways \u2013 which again was a good diversion from the Convention; families will like that part. There is an Avis office on site which is convenient. One large negative was the poor quality of wireless internet. For $5/day it\u2019s an AT&T coupon service and a number of people complained about its slowness. I initially had a downstairs corner room which had no internet reception, so weak was the signal. I changed rooms and got a very variable service \u2013 very slow to OK, but never fast. Also, for a place that\u2019s hosting possibly over 1,000 convention-goers, the eating choices are small and thinly staffed. Both breakfast and lunch usually involved long queues. One time, getting a coffee from the deli took 10 minutes. Overall, as a convention hotel it was a bit better than the usual soul-less hotel tower but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d want to stay here as a regular traveller, especially when there is a convention, due to the strain on facilities.

From the looks of the place, the last remodel was done around 78-82. I had a room in the big tower at the back of the property and the room was definitely a blast from the past. The dark blue carpet, dark wood furniture and the cinder block construction took me back to the days when I would be sleeing in on that blue carpet with my brother. If you wanted to wear your liesure suit and gold medalion you would fit right in. Someone told me that they intentionally kept the decor like this as some sort of retro Chic thing. I doubt it. I will say that the sheets were clean, the towels were clean and good quality and the room overall was clean and well kept. there was a funny smell like old cardboard or particle board in part of the room but nothing too horrible. These sort of places love to tell you how everything you need is right there on the property so you never need to go anywhere. And, if you like mediocre food, over-priced souvenirs and horrible, slow, awful , bad service then they are right. We ate at several restaurants on the property and the service was invariable slow and not particulary friendly. But that may just be because it was California. The food however was always mediocre at best and lousy was a more common adjective. There is only one reason you should stay here. And that is if your company sends you to attend a trade show in one of the big halls on the west side of the property.

I could only get good reception at the pool (not a bad thing actually, but annoying at 10 pm!) The health club cost $5 per day which I found ridiculous. Good thing the weather was good and I could walk and run around the facility. I stayed in a bungalow which I think is the nicest choice in the resort. It was only one story. The rooms were basic, clean but not luxurious by any stretch of the imagination. The carpet was stained and my bathroom was so small that my husband and I could not be in there at the same time. However, the gardens and surroundings were lovely - roses of every variety growing along gardens in every corner. There were also many pools, none of them crowded. The staff was uniformly pleasant, helpful and welcoming; greeting me everywhere I walked. This is a lovely facility for a wedding or party In fact several weddings were going on that weekend. It also is conveniently located. It is about 5 minutes to the beach, 5 minutes to Old San Diego, 10 minutes to downtown or the airport. We even took a sunset horseback ride on the beach, on the border of San Diego and Tijuana and the drive was about 20 minutes. Just know that your room will be small and many of the other buildings looked older and rundown, so ask for a bungalow room.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City", "Title": "\u201cWould not go to this place again\u201d", "Author": "KC2833", "ReviewID": "UR119125630", "Content": "I recently attended a conference at this hotel. We stayed at the hotel as it was the host hotel and we did not know better. I would not stay there again. We got checked in quick, but when we got to the room we had reserved (a room in the towers with elevators), it was on the second floor of a little building with only stairs to get in to it. We stayed there as so hard to change rooms. The room was definately outdated. Looked like something my 80 year old mother in law would like. It did seem clean to me that is why we stayed. The beds were ok and the pillows were acceptable. The TV was very small and you could not really see it well from the beds. Would have been nice to have a refrigerator and microwave. At other hotels of this price you would get this. I did not like the convention set up. It was very spread out and hard to find rooms. It was raining one day so very hard with having to go around the resort and walk. We got soaked! I would not want to go back to a convention there again. Eating at the resort was not the best either. The service seemed to be really slow. We ate at Trellises for breakfast some times and it was slow. The omelettes were great though! Definately not a good resort for people with disabilties. There are lots of steps and length of walking. The pool was pretty but we did not try it. Would be good for kids. The good thing about the resort is about 10 min from aiport ($20 with taxi). It is located right next to the trolley system. This is a great and cheap way to get to many places in San Diego. Also, the Fashion Valley mall is right behind the hotel and has places to eat and shop which we enjoyed.

I should have heeded his warning but decided to chck for myself. I go to my room which was in the newer \"better\" Royal Palms Tower. The room was probably really nice in the 1980s. Still had a crummy boxy picture tube television which did not have a clear picture. Room smelled bad and looked dirty. All this for $159 a night! I tried calling the front desk 3 times from the room phone and the call kept on not going through. Needless to say, I went back to the front desk and asked for the manager and told her about the room and said that I didn't want to stay here and wanted to know if I could cancel my reservation and she agreed to do it and even waived the one night charge for canceling the reservation. She was great and very accomadating. It really didn't seem to bother her too much that I wanted to leave and she was a pleasure to deal with. I'm sure she deals with this a lot.

To get everything wrong as consistently as the Town and Country does - they have to be trying. No way could this much badness be an accident. Sleep on a park bench before you stay here. A few highlights, I mean lowlights. The rooms are very old, dingy, and dated, all beat up. All rooms are entered from the exterior - there are no interior hallways. The headboard for my bed didn't actually reach to the floor. It was too small so it had been bolted to the wall. The alarm clock was hidden behind the TV with the cord wrapped around it (so off) - I found that it on the last night of my stay. TV was blurry, I don't know how they managed that with cable. It was perfectly alright for a hotel worker to stroll along the hallway at 5am with a noisy cart - who needs sleep? The bathroom door would not close - it was one of those sliding doors that had come off the runners years ago - which is probably an apt metaphor for the entire property. No safes in the rooms, great for a conference venue where everybody brings a laptop. No ramp to get into the tower unless you walk all the way round the back. Conference logistics were anything but logical - meeting rooms downstairs, exhibition halls and break rooms upstairs, not reachable without going outdoors (it was raining of course). The \"high-speed\" internet timed out on simple Google searches. The food was even worse. Kelly's is the worst restaurant I have eaten at in a very long time. After being seated we waited 30 minutes for someone to say, \"I'll be with you in a few minutes.\" Drink orders were taken, then another 30 minutes later, food orders. When we complained the server was extremely rude. The food was abysmal - $25 filets and such that were not as good as you can get at Denny's. My \"demi glaze\" was actually a runny soup. My neighbor's ribs were \"horrid\". Last night there I ordered a hamburger and a beer from room service. It arrived 95 minutes later. 1 hour and 35 minutes for a hamburger! I called twice to ask about the delay and was assured both times that it was on its way. It wasn't of course, which was easy to tell because my receipt had the order time printed on it - after my call. The room service was also rude to me when I asked why a hamburger was taking so long. Everything about this hotel screams cost cutting and being cheap. Calling a place a resort that is (a) in the middle of town, (b) has nothing but a pool, and (c) has consistently below standard service and amenities - is just wrong. This was not an individual bad experience. I was at a conference with about 150 colleagues and it became a running joke how bad the place was.

Worst resort I have ever stayed at!!!!\u201d", "Author": "HST_Gal", "ReviewID": "UR118996147", "Content": "My friend and I recently stayed at the Town and Country Resort for 5 nights and wished we were somewhere else most of the time we were there. The front desk staff were not very welcoming, and although we arrived early, we were told our rooms would be ready by 3:30pm. We checked back with front desk staff at 4:30, and only one of two rooms were ready. It was 5:45 pm before the second room was ready. The front desk staff did not apologize for the inconvenience at all. The rooms were not what we had registered for nor confirmed. We registered for rooms with king beds and both of us actually ended up with rooms that had two double beds. Both rooms had 1 inch gaps between the bottom of the door and the flooring, which would have allowed insects and small critters to enter the room. As a result, we both stuffed towels and pillows under our doors each night to avoid such scenarios. One room did not have a hair dryer available, and when one was requested, it took nearly 55 minutes before it was delivered. When my friend attempted to use the hairdryer, there were sparks coming from the plug of it. The bathtub in one room was not clean \u2013 there were rings of soap remaining from shampoo bottles utilized by previous occupants. The Kleenex box was empty and was not refilled for two day and the d\u00e9cor was extremely dated - like 1980s!! There were no desks in the rooms for working, and as a resort that is accustomed to hosting business conferences, the rooms should all have proper desks and appropriate chairs conducive to business. The small round table and chairs are absolutely not conducive to effective working conditions for business personnel. There were no extra blankets available in the room which is especially critical since neither the heating nor air conditioning units were in working order. The water bottles in both rooms were not replenished after being consumed by occupants 2 and 3 days prior. There was no refrigerator or mini bar/snack bar available in rooms which is absolutely standard at every other \"resort\" I have stayed at. A proper resort would never offer a combo shampoo/conditioner product, but rather would offer spa quality personal products. As a result, my collegue and I went out and purchased shampoo and condictioner for use during our stay. One of our rooms was located next to a housekeeping room, and staff was extremely loud and disruptive beginning as early as 5:30am. So rude and inconsiderate!!!! Numerous carts were being pushed around at all hours of the day and night by staff, and was extremely disruptive. Many conference attendees had the same complaint. The security was inadequate to assure the safety of hotel guests. While this is a large complex, the resort could and should implement some basic safety precautions, such as having security personnel on duty and walking the premises, installing entrances that require use of card keys to enter hotel areas. Anyone could walk onto this property at any time without being stopped by personnel or card key access points. The food and service quality at each of the hotel restaurants was substandard. The staff no more than handed us our menus, and they proceeded to ask us if we were ready to order. When we requested another minute or two, they walked away and did not check back with us for nearly 10 minutes. Despite our attempts to get their attention, they continued to talk with other restaurant staff, and were oblivious to our attempts to wave them over/get their attention. Once we got our food, we repeatedly waited in excess of 15-20 minutes before our wait staff checked in and gave us our bill. There was a fitness center on the property but we were told that cost extra. That is ridiculous to charge extra for fitness center...especially at a resort! To top this ALL off, when we went down to check out, we weren't even asked how our stay was which I guess is not surprising b/c Im sure they are tired of hearing from guests how bad it is. They also didn't even offer to help us out to a cab with our big bags and is not easy to get out the door of that lobby. Appalling!!!! This entire property is in dire need of updating and a general maintenance overhaul! I would NEVER return to this resort and will not recommend this facility to any friends or colleagues, nor for any future conferences.

The fitness center has 3 new treadmills and 2 clunkers that still work though. They also have a rack of free weights, ellipticals and exercise equipment for strength training. The cons: The rooms and property need serious updating. Perhaps they should use the money they charge you for internet use ($9.95 a day) or the $5 I paid for ONE EGG at the Terrace Cafe to go towards renovations. I stayed here to attend a conference so it was convienent for me to be on site, however I would not stay here if I was vacationing and spending my own money.

Breakfast at the Terrace Cafe: we had the breakfast buffet a few times and thought the price was pretty good at $14.50. The cheese danishes were really good. We also had cafe mochas and hot chocolate and cookies at the little cafe in the evening, and service was always good. We had one lunch at Charlies and shared the burger sliders: nothing wow. We had read reviews about how great Trellises was, so our last morning we had breakfast. Very expensive: we thought our $30 buffet was a little high (for 2) but we spent close to $60 for 2 at Trellises. The selling point: we both had the eggs benedict and wow!!! they were great. Had a sticky bun, cheese danish, and juice/milk with both. Angelica was an awesome server. She was so funny and wonderful to be around. The grounds were amazingly beautiful.

My first impression was not great, but I came to love it! The most important thing to happiness at town and country, is the room you get. There are several buildings, each with their own pros and cons. I would say that the best are the trellis rooms, or the big tower (don't remember it's name) Other rooms are more motel style, and some are absolute dumps, while others are pleasant enough, with lovely sitting areas in front, and/or private-ish verandas. I should know, because in ten days, I had 4 different rooms assigned to me. This is because I was not happy with the first thing I got, and when I complained, I got better, each time! It boils down to their apparent policy of a \"first come, first serve\" assignment of rooms. I was coming in to lecture at a conference there, and needed a room that was quiet, had a desk, and a window that opens, for fresh air. I let them know that 2 months in advance, and was told that I could not be guaranteed which room I'd get, but that it would be reserved in either the big tower, or the trellis area. When I arrived, I was sent to the smaller tower, and a room there with no desk and a view of a dumpster! I was then moved to a room in the \"3300\" building. It had no window that open, no desk, and lots of loud people running up and down the halls... it was deplorable!!!!!!!!!! Next I was put in the 3500 rooms, which are very nice, in a lovely rose garden area, and from there I could easily walk to the big pool, the restaurants and conference center. However, that room had no window that open, and very strong odor from carpet cleaning chemicals. 2 days later, a friend showed me his lovely room in the large tower, and I requested a move, which was graciously accommodated. A bellman quickly came to me room and helped me move, complete with a ride in the golf cart! The big tower was my favorite! nice balcony, overlooking everything, and a beautiful, business-sized desk. The grounds are gorgeous!!!! At that time of year there were thousands of roses blooming, hibiscus, palm trees everywhere. I spent time by each of the three pools, and they were all nice. It's quieter by the trellis restaurant, and there is a bar there too, for refreshments. It took me 5 days to find the breakfast buffet at the \"deli\" location. (not well advertised!) The hotel staff was genuinely nice to work with. All workers that I encountered there seemed happy to be there, and very positive. The whole place is kind of like an oasis in the middle of a busy city with lots of \"standard\" hotels. This was different. Trees, flowers, creeping vines... like a beautiful jungle oasis, and happy people within it! It was a little confusing to figure out the maze of conference rooms and spaces, at first, but once I \"got it\". it became very enjoyable, and much better than the typical \"cookie cutter\" conference hotels that I am so used to.

The complex is large with many buildings, several restaurants, at least 2 pools, and a bridge to the Fashion Valley Mall across the trickle of water called the river. Be sure they give you the map of the resort when you check in. I too was disappointed by the room decor, but became happy with our view of the pool, the cleanliness of the rooms, and the friendly staff. Once you get your bearings, you learn the zoo, beaches, harbor, many attractions are not far. But you really need a car to get around, The trolley is across the bridge by the shopping center and it will get you to the harbor, Old Town and some of the tourist attractions. This is a very good hotel for a conference or small to medium size convention. I wpuld not choose it for a short vacation unless you only wish to \"shop till you drop\" at the mall. it is a terrific mall with a good selection of shops.

You walk out the back of the hotel and San Diego's transport system is right there. We used this both days we were there, and it goes to all the tourist places you could want to go to. It costs $5 for an all day ride pass. The second great feature, was right on the far side of the MTS. It is a huge mall with lots of great stores. So about a 5 minute walk out of the back of the hotel, you can either go golfing, get on the MTS to anywhere in San Diego, or spend a whole day at the huge mall. We were lucky this trip, that the grandparents took care of the kids, so it was just my wife and me. However this hotel is definetly tailored to families. They had activities everyday for families and kids. Lots of space for the kids to run around, and lots of pools. We would definetly recommend this hotel to anyone going to San Diego, whether you are a family or just a couple. As well the staff was excellent.

The location is great, and this is the main reason I chose this hotel. It's within walking distance to Fashion Valley Mall and the Trolly (San Diego's awesome public transportation).

This was working perfectly until we called the hotel to have the van come get us and were told it would be 25 minutes before they could come. This was after we were told by the driver to simply call the hotel when we were done and they'd come right back and get us. And oh guess, what--surprise, surprise, Rhodes Scholar, Elisha was in charge of dispatching the vans and wouldn't send one to get us. She said the driver was on lunch. Oh really? You knew you had customers out and would need a ride back soon and you approved a lunch break when nobody else would be available to pick us up? Brilliant. They also refused to pay for a cab to bring us back, so we had to simply wait for the van to \"become available\" as Elisha put it. When the driver finally returned, he asked what took so long and said that he was never on lunch. So the dispatch is lying now. Upon returning to the hotel, I asked for Elisha's manager, though the only person around that was above Elisha was a similarly unprofessional woman named Tina. As Elisha went to tell Tina that we were waiting for her in the lobby, we literally saw Tina roll her eyes in annoyance that we wanted to speak to her about this. Tina was as unwillingly to apologize for this error as I imagined she would be. And she even had the gall to blame the driver more than once. Wow. Sure, blame the lowest guy on the totem pole for a mistake that you could have easily corrected, and couldn't have possibly been his fault as he is not the one dispatching the vans. At one point, she must have been exhausted by my insistence that she apologize and take ownership b/c she turned exasperatedly to her partner in crime (Elisha) and whined, \"What is it that she wants me to do for her? I mean, is there anything we can possibly do for her???\" Mind you reader, she is asking this with all the sarcasm and disrespect she could muster. So there you go. And for the record, the only nice staff members we encountered there were the van drivers. We had used them several times before this incident and Oscar, Orlando or Octavio--can't remember which, and Kirk or Kurt--can't remember which, were ALL extremely polite, helpful and courteous. The problem there is Elisha. And Tina. And however much further up the chain of command it goes--I don't know. Additionally, the decor was outdated, and the grounds a little run down. Beautiful roses were in bloom, but also untidy. We had to shout \"Hello? Is anybody here?\" when we first walked into one of the restaurants bc nobody was staffing it. We ate one meal there and it was good, but nothing to write home about. They have three pools on the property and oddly they wouldn't serve food or drink at the pool. There was a complete lack of visible signage which was annoying b/c it is a big property and easy to lose your way. We had two hair dryers plugged into one room and the power went out. We joked about this hotel feeling like an assisted living community b/c there were so many old people in wheelchairs and the decor lives up to that.

Upon arrival, we (my girlfriend and I) checked into the hotel just a stroke before midnight, and were informed that we had already been checked in. We both exchanged a few words of confusion, which I'll just assume the front desk employee didn't pick up on, and were handed keys and shown a map of where we were to park. The hotel is spread out over a sizable area, with a portion of the rooms being in a 10-story or so tower-like building and the rest of them being in what I can only describe as trailers. Not trailers like the on-wheels kind of trailers, I mean trailer park trailers. If a trailer park and an apartment complex had an illegitimate child, it would probably be called the Town and Country Resort. We ended up driving for 20-30 minutes searching for parking, as the parking situation is best described by the words \"pure idiocy\" and \"moronic\". The vast majority of the \"streets\" around the \"resort\" are practically one lane, leading to plenty of drawn out and awkward scenarios where you'll be maneuvering around another poor soul's car. Each set of trailers has it's own parking lot, only fitting about 20 cars or so, which is far too few. Around the corner is a two-story parking structure (one lane) and with a bafflingly low 6-foot clearance. In our search for a parking spot, we drove around the cramped structure only to reach the abrupt end of it, which is just a wall, so getting out of the structure (one lane, still) involves having to make your car shuffle into the opposite direction to leave, while hoping no one is coming in the opposite direction. We finally found parking in the back lot, which is much larger but has tiny parking spots and, again, narrow lanes to navigate. We got out of the car and spent 5-10 minutes walking back to our trailer style room, slid the key into the door, opened the door, and were greeted with a room with luggage and clothes strewn about, as it was already inhabited. We left and made management aware, who offered us another trailer room, which we dutifully declined, already angry that it was now pushing midnight and we just spent 20 minutes looking for parking just to turn right back around. Skipping all of the issues between, we were eventually moved to a room in the tower style building. Like the rest of the hotel, the room is disastrously dated. Don't let the photos online fool you, I am scrolling through their provided room photos now and none of them match the room we were in, which I'm assuming was a step-up from the trailer style room. The bathroom is small and the floor is made of dirty tiles, and (my favorite part) the shower head is about 5'5\", so I spent a great deal of time trying to kneel down beneath it. I just grit my teeth and pushed through this problem though, as I knew that the quicker I got showered and dressed, the quicker we could leave this horrid place. I would not suggest this hotel to anyone, not even my worst enemy. I've stayed at plenty of hotels that looked cheap or dated on the outside, but had those stays redeemed by passable room interior- this was not the case.

It's not unusual to be nickel-and-dimed to death in hotels, but this hotel is charging top prices for a hotel that's one advantage is its location: in Mission Valley, close to Interstate 8 and Fashion Valley Shopping Center, and minutes from the ocean, downtown San Diego, and Balboa Park. Aside from location, Town and Country \"Resort\" Hotel can't compete with other similar properties. It doesn't help that the staff is uncooperative and sometimes out and out rude. We come to this hotel annually for a convention (it's the ONLY reason I would stay here). One year, the hotel staff caused the convention to come to a stand-still by forcing participants to move out of their rooms immediately despite earlier approval of an extended check-out time. They literally threatened to go into the rooms and remove all items, placing them in the hallway or outdoor pathways. Again, this was after approving a late check out time. One year we left, and within minutes realized we had left an item in the room. We called immediately and was told Reception would have to check with Housekeeping. Subsequent calls were treated with shortness and simple \"Nothing was found.\" This was truly one of the rudest Reception desks I've interacted with, at least in half the interactions I had with Reception employees. This hotel always seems busy. Some of the money coming in from higher rates and extra fees really needs to go back into the rooms and grounds. Planting rose bushes everywhere may make the grounds pretty, but it doesn't mask peeling paint, dated decor, and bathrooms that need a replacement of tubs/toilets/tiles etc. You can only pile on grout and sticky sealants so many times before it looks really tacky.

After being promised a new room, and it was ready, we arrived back at the hotel to find out that there was no room. The desk clerk was quite rude about telling me they only hold rooms until 6. I was assured by the clerk who set it up that it was held indefinitely. We had also rented a fridge that never materialized despite repeated calls to the front desk. Even after my husband told them to remove it from the bill there was no empathy for our troubles. As far as the \"resort\" and room, they were subpar. Upon check in you are given a map on how to get to your building. The map has marked streets, the actual streets are not marked. Incredibly frustrating. The grounds have lots of roses but it doesn't look pretty -I don't think they are maintained well. The room we ended up in was in the tower on the 2nd floor. It was the bedroom part of the suite - they close up suites to make two rooms?? The room was decorated hideously - turquoise floral prints, with mismatched cherry and wicker furniture. The worst is that there were very few electrical outlets. The bed was soft and worn out - it had big dips in it. They had terrible scratchy sheets. The carpeting was buckling in places and needed cleaned. Everything looked and felt old and worn out. The walls are very thin. Every time the phone rang next door, we heard it. We also heard them use the toilet, shower and blow dry their hair. Like they were in our room. It was very loud. The shower was ok but the head was placed very low on the wall. The bathroom appeared clean and maintained. There was a sink in with the shower and one in the entry way that made it easy for me to get ready while my husband showered. Towels were rough and unforgiving. The one thing this place has going for it is that the Fashion Valley Transit Station is behind the parking lot. It was very easy to get to SDCC every morning.

I always stay in a Tower room (which was very clean). However, the king size bed and pillows were uncomfortable and the bedding old and worn. The TV, which is not a flat screen, had horrible reception. My first night there I ordered room service (Chicken tacos). The dinner arrived cold and didn't include the rice and guacamole as indicated on the menu. I called room service and was told that they were out of rice and guacamole. Really? How can that be and if so, why didn't they call to let me know so that I could have chosen another meal? I asked for a discount on the dinner and was told that they couldn't accommodate that request. They offered to send me soup or dessert free of charge. I chose a cheese cake, which wasn't very good. I would have preferred the discount. The food of the breakfast buffet for each four mornings that I ate there to be lukewarm. Aren't there food temperature laws in California? The selection wasn't as good as in previous years. Also, there was no toaster available to toast the bagels, etc. How about bringing back the toaster as part of the breakfast buffet? The coffee, supposedly Starbucks, was absolutely watery. The Sunshine Deli, with its friendly staff, had a good selection of cold salads, but the lettuce wasn't as fresh as it could be. For the prices charged, the food quality and coffee served there should be better. The first night (Wednesday) of my stay Charlie's was closed. Why?? We went to Kelly's for a drink and found the bartender and staff friendly and the drinks and appetizers good. However, the restaurant was really like stepping back into the 1960's. With a little bit of upgrading, it could be a great place instead of appearing old and sad. You can't exactly attract a younger crowd of people with that ambience. On Saturday night, our convention group went to Charlie\u2019s to celebrate. They tried to close the place at midnight despite that fact that we have a contract which that stated that they are to stay open until 2 am. We had to produce the actual contract to get them to stay open. Even then, there was some grumbling by the staff about having to stay open for a handful of people. We tried to order food before midnight and was told that they kitchen was closed. A group of us had to order delivery pizza to get food at that hour. Poor business. At least have the staff let its customers know that the kitchen is about to close. The general atmosphere at Charlie\u2019s is not friendly.

This is an old but attractive facility. We stayed on the sixth floor of the tower, where the rooms are accessible via an outside corridor. The resort has extensive outdoor space that is attractively landscaped, which concrete areas where large groups of people can mingle, and many places to sit \u2013 both in and out of the shade. A Bridge acquaintance said she experienced noisy neighbors next to her tower room, and her room was without question moved by the management to one of the low-rise buildings, which provided complete quiet. My wife stayed here alone a couple of years ago and contracted food poisoning from an off-site restaurant. The hotel staff was greatly helpful and solicitous, and she really appreciated the concern they demonstrated in this 24 hour-period of feeling quite awful. The swimming pool is attractive and swimmers, particularly children, were obviously enjoying themselves there. Each room in the tower has a private balcony, which suffered somewhat from traffic noise from the expressway about a half a mile away, in addition to the temperature being generally on the cool side to sit out in the shade while we were there. An attractive feature was that our room had two bathroom sinks, which allowed us to dress in the morning and get ready for bed at night without getting in each other\u2019s way \u2013 a feature we do not often encounter in hotels. We sampled the moderately-priced restaurants on site, but not their high-end restaurant. These were certainly adequate although not outstanding. A most wonderful feature of the Resort is being only about a half mile from Fashion Valley, an upscale outdoor mall. About half way to the mall there is a stop for the San Diego light rail system and a major bus stop. I am sure one can go to lots of places from there using public transport, although we did not explore this. Fashion Valley is a pleasant and attractive place \u2013 even for me who hates to shop. It also offers a number of good dining choices. Our favorites included the restaurant in Nordstrom, the California Pizza Kitchen, and the Haagen Dazs ice cream store which is easily spotted from the entrance to California Pizza. We used Super Shuttle to get to and from the airport. This is efficient and reasonably priced. The drivers were most pleasant. We booked in advance on-line. Our shuttle was waiting for us when we arrived in San Diego. My wife went back before I did because I had a convention in San Diego a couple of days later. Her shuttle was at the Resort when we arrived five minutes before the scheduled pick-up time, and my shuttle also arrived a few minutes early. During my stay the snack bar closed down for renovations, and workmen were also renovating a couple of rooms nextdoor. I was impressed that the owners are putting in significant resources to keep this old facility in repair and attractive. Thus, the rooms next to ours were not just getting new carpets, but also new closets and I believe new bathrooms. I am confident that we could return in ten years to find this facility still an attractive place to be.", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "st. louis, mo", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful but you might get lost\u201d", "Author": "labdaddy", "ReviewID": "UR114690898", "Content": "I recently stayed at this hotel for 4 nights and was fairly pleased.

That was the first issue we had with the room. The second issue was lighting. The room was very dark, it had one lamp on the nightstand, a small overhead light over the table and a candelabra style fixture mounted on the wall near the bathroom.

The friendly lady who checked us in and smilingly handed my fellow traveler who sat in her wheelchair her room key should have mentioned that this may be a problem. We did not request a handicapped room as usually hotels do not have steps into the room entrances. The front desk told us that they could not help us as there were so many requests for handicapped rooms at the last minute that they were out. We had trouble finding a place to eat at the hotel as it is a complex array of paths that are unmarked. On the map, the paths all seem to have names. Asked a cleaning lady for directions only to be told, \"I don't speak English.\" We found the Garden Trellises Restaurant. We looked forward to eating yummy food and tried to overlook the high prices on the menu. But eating stale chips with a $12 chip and dip appetizer did nothing to boost our image of this hotel. They did finally give us more chips...after we were finished with our lunch. All the grit in the clam chowder made us feel like we were at the beach. The waitress told us that she's had no other complaints about the chips or the clam chowder the whole day. She said maybe she should try the chips first next time(hopefully not from the plates she is going to serve!). We got to the conference room to set up a booth and were told that the hotel double-booked the room so it would not be ready until the time we were supposed to be done setting up. That all worked itself out. When we got back to our room and were getting changed, a man came bursting in with a key and then asked if we were leaving as this was the room they assigned to he and his wife. Yes, that made us nervous about the hotel's security. We were very grateful that we were in the room at the time as we had all our stuff there. Got to the conference okay and finally figured out the maze of paths a bit so feeling more comfortable with getting around. But came running back to the room only to find out that the key didn't work. Ran back to the conference to get the other key only to find that the other key didn't work either. Went to the front lobby (about 10 mins. walk) and was told by the lady that the keys no longer worked because they disabled them so the other couple could no longer get in. Well, thank you but what about our keys? She gave me new keys and I was able to get in. Ordered room service later that night. The menu plainly said that the entree I ordered included (at no extra charge) a soup or salad. When I mentioned this as I was ordering, the man said it was an extra $2.95. I spoke with 3 different people in trying to explain to them that this was wrong only to be transferred back to this same man who said that HIS menu was the new one and what he had to charge me. So, I was charged an extra $2.95 for my iceberg lettuce with a few tomatoes scattered on the side. We got used to the constant hum of machinery right outside the door and it probably helped that the ice machine was broken so we didn't hear people getting ice all night. The skylight in the bathroom had enough lightbulbs so the burnt out one didn't seem to affect the lighting. Wifi is extra but so are many other places. I didn't need the alarm clock plugged in so that was the outlet I used as I could not find any other sockets but the ones that were used by the lamp and the clock by the bedside. The other choice was the one other socket on the other side of the room but that is not where I wanted to sit. Once I unplugged the clock and got the cobwebs off the plug, it worked fine. And I didn't see any of the spiders that made such a fine network of webs. The next day, again ran back to the room from the conference only to find that once again, my key didn't work. I knew better than to get the other key. I explained my situation to a staff lady there and she directed me to a phone to call. They said somebody would meet me. I waited outside the room for about 10 mins. and then got impatient. I asked somebody else who worked at the hotel and she said to go get another key from the front lobby. I told her I was not going to walk another 10 mins. to the front lobby as this happened yesterday also. I think my voice was getting louder as another staff said he would open the door for me (didn't check any i.d.). About 10 mins. later, a man knocked on my door and said \"Oh, somebody must have opened the door for you.\" I told him the key didn't work yesterday but it was because another couple came into our room. He thought this was funny and burst out laughing. He then checked the lock and said it was broken. He said it would take him about 10 mins. to change it but needed to be in the room to do it.

Also they did not mention that this would be going on during my stay and completely ruined any chance of afternoon naps, reading, or any quiet activity in the room. -They nickel and dime you to death (internet $10, gym $5, parking $14, check out earlier than initial check out date after you check in and you have to pay for a FULL night - even if it's with 6 days notice, .50 per local call) - apparently you can get a \"bundle discount\" for internet, parking, and gym but they don't mention it when you check in. -Room smelled like smoke -Shower head only good for short people (luckily I'm short but for anyone over 5'3\" it could be a definite negative) -Phone was old and had bad reception (even for local calls) The hotel is fine if you have a conference on the grounds here - if not DEFINITELY stay somewhere else where you will get more quality and some of your basic amenities included!", "Date": "April 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat place if you got money to burn\u201d", "Author": "groves_six", "ReviewID": "UR105737127", "Content": "Good: hot water, nice flowers, most of staff is friendly and helpful.

I spilled some pizza sauce on my bed one night and the next morning, came back to a halfway made up bed with Pizza Sauce still on it.

This place will also nickel-and-dime you to death. They charge for use of the fitness room, parking (specially DISCOUNTED rate of $8 per day -- usually $16 for guests), and $10 per day for very patchy and painfully slow internet. What is it about the inverse relationship between the rate you pay for a hotel and the likelihood that internet will be included?!?! They have plenty of on-site restaurants that provide service with a smile (again, the only redeeming quality) but you'll end up paying way too much for really mediocre food. The location doesn't help -- it's in a wasteland surrounded by highways. The five nights I spent here were among the most unrestful I've ever had... and I'm into backpacking. To starte, the beds were terribly uncomfortable. Every night some time between 1 and 2am we were disturbed by loud conversations from people returning to their rooms; it seems to me that a complex like this should really have a designated quiet hour.

What a horrible design idea. The room has three \"porno\" style mirrors on the wall in front of the bed. Apparently, I was not the only one who thought that, which was evident by what I can only imagine were bodily fluids on the mirror. Whoever picked out the artwork for the room needs to find a new line of work. There was a picture of this creepy looking vintage-style girl on one wall. If you ever stayed there you know what I'm talking about. If you ever stay there you will know what I mean. Bring something to cover the picture. On another wall was a latin-inspired print and colonial style flowers on another. I have no idea how they thought that matched. The bathroom had close to no room to put anything on the sliver of a counter they offered. Of course you wouldn't want a big counter since it would make the child-sized toilet look even smaller. The ironing board had years worth of crud on it that I feared would get on my clothing so I opted not to use it. I wont even bore you with my comments on the bedding, but enjoy.

If your employer hasn't paid for your room and you don't require the convenience of being on the grounds for a conference, stay at the Double Tree.

I traveled here for a conference, and while the hotel was beautifully landscaped there was nothing else to compliment- especially at $130-150/night. I tried to check-in and the front desk said that the reservations I had made in October had been deleted 2 days before my check-in (This also happened to one of the colleagues I was travelling with). I had the paperwork from my original reservations in hand so they finally relented and gave me a room. My colleague was denied a room and ended up at the Marriot across the highway (much nicer and newer anyways). The hotel is very spread out, and I dragged my luggage to a two-story building in the center of the \"resort\" - there were no elevators so I had to carry everything upstairs myself. I found an extremely dated room that looked older than I am. The room was a decent size but the walls were thin and I could hear my neighbors. Cracked tiles in the bathroom, hair on the bathroom floor, the tub handle came off everytime I tried to turn on the shower and the toilet rocked. My closet doors didn't shut all the way, and there was only one available power outlet in the room, unless I wanted to unplug the lamp in the room. The bed was hard and the comforter was so old that it was covered in fuzzies/pilled spots on the fabric. The tv was old and only got a few channels and I got to use the internet for 5 min one day out of the 6 I was there by walking to someone else's room. The hotel has wireless but it is EXTREMELY spotty and will cut off in a few minutes. The maid staff seemed nice, but were never consistent in what they left me- one day they took the bar of soap I left by the sink and never replaced it, somedays I had plenty of towels, somedays there wasn't a single washcloth in sight. I tried the Sunshine Deli, The Cottage Cafe, Trelisses and Charlies. The staff and food at the Deli were great- they had amazing chocolate chip cookies. The Cottage Cafe was okay, Charlies was completely unaccomadating to food allergies and food allergies were hit or miss at Trelisses. We had lunch at Trelisses and had a rude waiter named Jesus who did not even try to accomadate my food allergies (no acidic foods- ie no tomatoes/citus/bell peppers- I just wanted a plain salad) he completely ignored our table and I actually had to find another waiter to get our check (I used to wait tables in college so I am usually very understanding if servers are busy or such). We went back to Trelisses another night and had a server named Jamie and she was great. I wasn't the only one who had problems- one of my other colleagues went 3 days without hot water before they would move her into another room and she missed several parts of the convention trying to wait for the maitence staff. If you want to use the gym it is $5/day and the sauna and hot tub are $25/day. We went to the concierge several times with questions, and everytime were given answers- ie. whether we could print boarding passes, get a ride somewhere, etc. I think that the only reason this hotel still gets business is that there is a conference center located on the property so it is convient for that.

If you've read other reviews then you know that this Hotel is very old and needs updating. The best way I can think of describing it is to say: \"Think of staying at a 1980s retirement community.\" The grounds are nice and there are people driving around in golf carts (because the place is so spread out) but the furniture is old and looks like grandma has been using the same bedspread that your mom grew up with. You check in at the lobby then walk or get a golf cart escort to your room. I had reserved a King room but was given a double (not a big deal). The rooms have very old decoration, old TVs (cathode ray tube), fuzzy reception on several channels but are otherwise very clean. The mattress on the bed felt old and stiff. I could feel individual springs through the sheets. Internet is provided by ATT-wifi (daily fee) and is spotty at best (can check an email or two before signal is lost). I called to ask where the best place in the complex was for a good signal and was told \"outside.\" While this may be accurate I don't feel that it's an acceptable answer. The conference facilities have been fine so far and I think that's why this place still operates. I ran into several other conference attendees who were also a little surprised by the hotel rooms as well. I'm not really a hotel snob but if I'm paying upwards of $150 per night for a hotel I expect something better than what Motel 6 offers. If you're old this place will probably remind bring back memories. If you're under age 65 I would recommend looking elsewhere. I was able to check out early. They were nice enough to waive the $50 per night fee it would have been to check out prior to my scheduled stay. I haven't seen this policy at other hotels so it leads me to believe that the situation has come up more than once at this place. I had some pretty bad experiences with the parking lot attendant and security guard which are likely isolated incidents related to personalities and led to me leaving the hotel early so that's why they waived the fee. Pros: Clean Landscaping with lots of flowers and trees Several restaurants on site Good for old people Friendly front desk staff Cons: OLD OLD OLD beds and decoration Very hard old mattress Old cathode ray tube TV with fuzzy channels on 1/2 of my stations Spread out - everything is a walk from your room. Wi-Fi internet - poor signals throughout, unreliable, not for business traveler Beware of angry security guy and parking lot attendant. Let's say you book for a week but need to leave early, you are charged $50 per day for the remaining days on the reservations that you didn't stay. Not good for young travelers.

The grounds are beautiful and the rooms are big, clean, and comfortable. The big problem I had with the Town & Country was the borderline negligence of the wait staff at the Trellises Garden Grille. I have an allergy to wheat. As such, I come prepared to notify the waitress or waiter whenever I eat out. I ate at Trellises for lunch and breakfast almost every day I was there and each time, I was sure to let the wait staff know about my allergy. Without fail, every time I was served something, there was wheat in it - croutons in the salads, pastry puffs in the soups, and on one occasion, I was served fish that had been dipped in flour and then cooked. With the fish, I took one bite, and immediately tasted wheat so stopped eating, but that little bit was enough to cause a pretty bad reaction and send me back to my hotel room early that day, making me miss several presentations at the conference I was attending. When I asked the waitress to verify if the fish was breaded or had wheat on it, she said \"Oh no, it only has flour\". I explained to her that four was made from wheat and she apologized and had the cook make me another dish. But when I got that one, it still appeared to have flour on it (probably from the grill). I told her I didn't feel comfortable with it, and she proceeded to argue with me about how seriously they take food allergies and how the fish was fine. Needless to say, I didn't eat it, and then got more grief about it when she came to clear the plates. Maybe I'm being a bit uptight, but I consider it pretty dangerous to not know what goes into your dishes and then reassure someone with a food allergy that their dish is fine, when it clearly is not. The lack of competence in making dishes without an allergen which is specifically flagged is dangerous... my allergy isn't as bad as others, but I would be worried for someone with a severe allergy because the restaurant staff clearly doesn't give a lick. Just to contrast, the next hotel I stayed at in San Diego, did a fabulous job with the wait staff double checking with the kitchen for each dish I ordered, and not making me feel bad about it either.

The grounds were nothing short of a garden; palms, roses, etc., and meticulously maintained. From my balcony, I looked down onto a clean, clear pool and yard. The elevator was fast and smooth. The door lock functioned just fine, and I walked into a room with a four-post king size bed. The slider opened out onto a balcony that looked out across the Hotel grounds, across to the nearby hills, and yet still seemed private. The tv was neatly hidden in an armoire, and there was a gaming control tucked in there as well, although I didn't get into that. The room was clean, bathroom and shower as well, right down to the vacuum patterns on the carpet. I actually took photos with my phone and sent them to my girlfriend, just to make her regret not coming along! Even the evening guard/ lot attendant was great!

Those with families will enjoy this resort and they even have movies on the week ends, shown on the lawn with popcorn, drinks, and all that goes with family enjoyment.

Where to begin? First off the sleeping rooms are cramped, old and reek of mold. The sink leaked about a gallon of water a night and the carpeting looked as if it just came off Lollapalooza, gross! Although the roach I shared the room with the first night seemed like a nice enough character. I complained about the condition of my room to my association and I was told, to \u201cget in line\u201d as many of the other attendees were complaining also. Also, $10 a day for in-room internet which performed subpar was a rip-off. The grounds are nice, but very dated and boring. There is nothing to do on the hotel property (sorry \u201cresort\u201d). It is walking distance to a mall, but you can only window shop so much. I asked the front desk for fun things to do in the area and they kept insisting I stay on property and hang out at one of the restaurants. After 2 days of hearing this I finally gave in. Mistake! The food is bland, over priced and unless you like hanging out in a lifeless, barfly setting, not the place to be. English is also obviously a problem here, because unless you are inside the hotel building (sorry \u201cresort\u201d) finding someone on property to speak the language is equal to Indiana Jones finding the Lost Ark. The meeting rooms themselves are very old, offer NO modern amenities, have very poor lighting and in 2 of the rooms a house sound system that kept breaking up.

Because the tournament was held on the T&C grounds, it was very convenient. The Room The room was just fine. As many have mentioned before, the room and grounds were very clean and tidy, and yes, a bit outdated. We had a standard room (2 queen beds) and it was roomy with a private balcony overlooking the pool area. Other families had a smaller room, so it may be just a matter of luck. And yes, we did have the weird picture of a young girl staring at us while we were in bed. My kids were freaked out, but it didn't bother me at all. The only complaints I have is that the showerhead is about 4 feet off the ground, so I had to bend over to get my head wet. Also the bathroom door is a sliding door and has no lock. My kids thinks it's fun to walk in on daddy during his \"private\" time. The Facilities The restaurants are great, but are way overpriced -- actually expensive. The deli sells Starbucks coffee at about double the normal price. The kids spent a lot of time in the pool, especially at night because it was heated. Bathrooms on the grounds and in the different buildings were hard to find and when found, they were very small (1 or 2 stalls) -- causing lines. A nice mall is located just behind the hotel with a walkway connecting the two. It was a great place to eat (decent food court) or to kill a few hours here and there. The Amenities Town & Country does charge you for everything. The rooms have no mini-fridge ($10 extra per day if you want one) which for an extended stay, causes a huge inconvenience. Internet access is another $10 per day. Fortunately, Town & Country uses AT&T for its internet service. So since I have an AT&T DSL account, I was able to access the internet for free. Internet service however was spotty and slow and there were times when I could not even connect. Parking was another $8 per day for hotel guests, but since I was with the YMCA group, I got a discount to $3 per day. Still, I'd rather pay zero. The convention area (where the gymnastics events were held) was nice. It was very spacious and clean. My only complaint about this area is that we were not allowed to bring food or drink into the area. The events were about 4-5 hours long and being able to snack on something would have been nice. Much to my surprise, there are no guest laundry facilities on site (just a dry cleaning service). The desk told us to go to the Best Western down the street to use their laundry. Instead, we googled for a local laundromat and went there since that would allow us to use multiple machines at once. Overall, my experience was good.

About 1/2 of the property is one and two story older motel style rooms and the remainder is in two connected high rises. The grounds are very well maintained with palms, roses, other plantings and walkways. There is a problem with signage and room numbers. Each day in the afternoon there are scores of people walking about pulling bags looking for thier room. They give you a map at checkin but don't put up street signs or room number signs anywhere. I got lost, and so did three others of my group of six. It wasn't just me, I met up with at least 20 others who had had the same problem. The solution is simple - Put Up some Signs with street names and building numbers. The room in the motel style part of the property are very typical of their date, the 1970's. They are large, mostly two double beds and a large but somewhat dated bath. The TV's are very out of date, 19\" and really only viewable from one of the two beds. Very clean but certainly showing a great deal of aging - two sitting chairs with dirty and threadbear arms, stained and thinning carpet, fixtures showing considerable wear and tear, a bath with very little water pressure and no fan (there was a window that is left openned that is 1 foot from the opposite wall,) My stay was on a Friday and Saturday night. On the first night it was very quiet but on the second night, the Saturday, the hotel, which appears to host a great deal of group and convention business, was having an incentive event on a central plaza, next to the pool. The event looked to be set up for a large outside group and included a DJ complete with six foot high speakers. He started to play 100dba music about 8:00pm and it could be heard in all rooms in the hotel. Although my room was not that close to the pool I was totally unable to hear my TV with the door and windows closed, nor could I have attempted to sleep. A call to the front desk let it be know that the group had booked until 12:00 but that the group would turn down the music at 10:00. At 9:45 I walked to the pool to view where the noise was coming from. To my surprise the DJ and his equipment was playing for a group of two people. The other six people at the party were inside a building WITH THE DOORS CLOSED. The property could have done much to mitigate this serious annoyance. Move it inside - move the location - not agree to 100dba music after 9:00 - This hotel did nothing, He, the DJ thought that soft music wass Micheal Jackson - \"Beat It\" was his quiet song at 11pm. The hotel has five restaurants - gives away two free drinks per person per day as well as a free buffet breakfast. I tried four of the five - the buffet breakfast was just plain awful, poor quality food, cold hot food and terrible service, although it was listed at $14.50 per person it would not have sold any if not given away free. The Trellis restaurant was better for the next breakfast with so so food but good service. I had a pizza in the sports bar which was a heated frozen one and my other dinner was in their steak house, not worth much at all except with both dinners I had my free drinks. The level of service at both was good - the quality about as bad as it could have been.

Consider the beautiful city of San Diego in sunny California. As an internationally renowned tourist destination with year round warm temperatures the appeal is obvious. Once you have made that decision consider the Town and Country Resort and Convention Center as the perfect spot to host your wedding. Believe me we checked out a multitude of the areas wedding venues and Town and Country Resort outshines them all! The 32 acre resort is well situated in the Mission Valley area. The grounds are lush with rose gardens---the pride of the owners. The perfect setting for an outdoor ceremony and your photographer's dream pallet. The accommodations vary from old California bungalows and garden rooms to tastefully modern high rise towers. There are so many amenities to enjoy that I suggest you visit their website www.towncountry.com. No, I am not an owner or employee plugging the resort, but rather an enthusiastic and very satisfied customer. The resort can do weddings on a grand scale in their magnificent ballrooms or delight you with a small affair in one of their on premise restaurants. We opted for the Trellises Garden Grille Restaurant for our wedding reception of fifty guests. The decor is elegant with various dining rooms, a bar, a marble dance floor and grand piano. Guests can step down to outdoor patio dining surrounded by gardens and a view of the pool. Excellent ambiance for your wedding guests. For entertainment Trellises Garden Grille provides music by The Pier Group Band. They will be glad to do private events and we recommend them highly to get that party going! Numerous times this restaurant has been voted number one in the San Diego area. The chef and service staff will work with your budget and make it an especially classy event to remember. They even feature an on-site bakery for that all important wedding cake. Your guests will be wined and dined for your reception and will enjoy a pampered stay at the resort. When you add up all these attributes you will not be disappointed as they truly have come up with the best formula for the perfect wedding. Kudos to all the friends we have made at this fine establishment who with their \" can-do \" attitude have given us such a memorable stay. We will be back!

The hotel has extra charges for everything.

Before I left for my trip several colleagues mentioned that it may be best to look elsewhere for accommodations, but I decided for the convenience aspect, I'd keep my reservation. Big mistake. My (first) room was in the Regency Tower. Stepping off the elevator at my floor I noticed the smell of urine (!!) and walked past fresh gum on the carpet which also looked as if it hadn't been vacuumed in a week. The decor was awful - who's idea is it to add blue carpet, a scary picture of a little girl on the wall (this picture was also in my second room in the Royal Palm tower) and curtains that date back to the 70's? After one night in this room I requested a move to the Royal Palm Tower, similar decor but a step up nonetheless. I thought about switching to one of the other hotels in the circle (there are MANY other options), but was told that it I would be charged $50-75 PER NIGHT of my unused stay if I wished to cancel. This made no sense especially since the hotel was at capacity and was even turning folks away due to lack of roms. I've never been at a hotel that enacted such a policy. Ridiculous. Be aware that this is 'nickel and dime' CENTRAL! Everything is extra so be prepared to pay for the gym ($8-10/day - only open until 8pm and the air was stagnant, no A/C or fans) and to use the internet ($9.95-12.95 per day). Several of the front desk staff were incredibly rude (When asked about internet my companion was told - 'Please wait until I'm finished and I'll answer your question'). I frequented the Terrace Cafe for breakfast and lunch and several times sat for 10 or more minutes before anyone came by to take my order or refill my drink. To avoid this, I would stop next door at the Deli to grab a Starbucks-type coffee and each morning the line was so long that it would take 15-30 minutes of standing in line to get a drink. (I blame the management for this one since they only had 1 staff behind the counter between 7am and 11am). If I were ever in the area again, I would stay at the Courtyard Marriott where the rooms were cheaper, the gym was free, there was hot complimentary breakfast, and you received $20 in coupons per day good for any food/drink at the hotel - and it's only a 5 minute walk to the Town and Country. A colleague of mine stayed there and was very pleased with his accommodations.

While the grounds and landscaping are absolutely lovely and well maintained, the resort is sprawling and does, indeed, have a 1950s feel to it. On the plus side, the convention center had nice facilities for the exhibition, including lots of restrooms (not always a given). The hall was well lit and ventilated. The main pool was heated and the jacuzzi was very large and worked well. I do wish parents would not dump their young kids off at the jacuzzi. Town and Country sits on Hotel Circle, and is very convenient to San Diego, the trolley line, a large mall, and Old Town San Diego. I don't mind paying $170/night for a room. I DO, however, mind being nickel and dimed for every extra cost, including: $14/day for parking; $10/day for internet access; $8/day to use the fitness center (and I'm pretty sure that was a discounted rate because I was there with a convention); and 95 cents to use my calling card from the room. There are so many other hotels on Hotel Circle where I could have gotten all of these amenitities for free and at a lower rate per evening. And I could have gotten a free breakfast. The room itself was very clean. The bathroom was tiny, and not particularly well lit. As a female traveler, I absolutely hate outdoor access to rooms (as best as I could tell, none of the rooms had controlled access through a security door or indoor corridors). The balcony was OK, and fairly private (I could not see either of my neighbors, which was nice). However, I did see some rooms at the ends of the corridors where their balcony stared straight out to a brick wall. Just a weird configuration. No flat screen TV, either. How is that possible in California? I ate two dinners at Charlie's, the sports bar. The food was OK, but way overpriced ($11 for a hamburger?). The service here was somewhat surly. The landscaping and cleaning staff all seemed to go out of their way to make me feel welcome. One of the cleaning crew even hustled over to open a door for me when I was lugging a carton into the convention center. Otherwise, the service was unimpressive. I would not recommend this place for the business traveler, especially if you are only staying one night, since the grounds are so massive, it takes forever to get a feel for the lay of the land. I saw one guy wandering aimlessly at 6:00 a.m. looking for the registration desk to check out while I was on my way to the gym. I finally was able to catch up to him and help him with directions. There are too many other business hotels (Courtyard, Residence Inn) on Hotel Circle to pick this place. Even for a resort destination, you can do better. I had some free time Monday morning and was hoping to use the spa. No dice. The spa is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays. And how in the 21st century, can the fitness center not have any ellipticals?

The beds are fantastic -- some of the best sleep of my travels. The bad is that it looks like its best days were in the Frank Sinatra era. Also, the showerheads in the bathroom are at chin level for short people (I was contorted to wash my hair and I'm not tall), and the walls are so thin you can hear every activity of your neighbors. Worse are that the TVs and cable reception are from the 50s too. Finally, we found the service atrocious.

So too was the concierge and the desk staff on check-in and check-out. Room service was also very fast. Meals were a bit pricy, though. As was the room rate. The support staff at the conference center were also on-the-ball when it came to helping out. Expect to stay in rooms with early 1980s carpets, tubs that do not drain particularly well, and halls with wall-paper that still smells of cigarette smoke over a decade after California banned indoor smoking. Don't take a first floor room. The sandbags hidden around the corners are there for a reason. When it rains, the first floor rooms tend to get a bit wet from leaks around the doors and windows. Parking costs: even for hotel guests. Internet is about $10 a day. Highway noise from I-8 is terrible unless you are on the ground or 2nd floors where the luxurious trees and plants provide a sound barrier. However, highway access to I-8, and 163 are excellent. One other thing - be very very careful when you plug in appliances in the room. The outlets in our room were improperly attached to the walls and the face-plates were broken. We reserved a king bed with balcony, non-smoking, allergen free. Unfortunately, the room provided was not what was reserved. They had given out all of the room types we wanted to people who had checked in one day earlier than us. And we had reserved our room 5 months in advance, paid a non-refundable first night's fee, and verified by e-mail, and twice by phone that we would get the room we requested.

Interestingly, 2 1/5 hours later when we finally got room keys, we didn't get anything that we had asked for. We complained to the front desk, but they could do nothing for us the first two nights, so we made the best of a bad deal and spent all 4 nights in substandard accommodations at a very high rate.

They are sitting on the balconies and hanging out in the hallways, conducting very loud conversations. They are roaming up and down the hallways and callling out to one another as they roam the property. Security - all 3 of them - are apparently running from buildling to building answering noise complaints. They obviously can't keep it under control. They refuse to ask these people to leave the property. That is unacceptable. Hotel management should not allow disruptive guests to stay. Apparently, they are so concerned with the almighty buck that they don't care about the other guests. Many of us are leaving tomorrow so apparently it doesn't matter if we are kept awake all night.

We literally drove past the hotel twice not wanting to believe the hotel was the one!

We headed to the room and when we opened the door was greeted by very old, dirty blue carpet everywhere in the room, including the bathroom. The double beds were harder than boards, and the furniture appeared to be out of something from a \"Golden Girls\" episode! The bathroom was so tiny, you could not use the toilet without the door literally in your face or the shower curtain hanging off your head! The fixtures were outdated, the TV had little or no signal (of course, 10 years old!), and there were so many stains on the lamp shades that I thought it was a \"patterned\" shade at first!

We also went to the \"casual\" bar for some beers (we had to have them after seeing that room) and ended up spending $100+ for a few beers and an appetizer each! Again, the \"bar\" looked like we were in a Golden Girls show! Yikes. We would never had checked in, but we were so tired and exhausted from flying across the country.

I saw photos and read some reviews and figured it looked like a bargain for the $100 AAA Rate that we got. As soon as we got there we got a good feeling seeing all the nice trees and fountains and greenery all around the property. Check in was pretty quick and simple and we were told to drive to the back and we would be staying in one of the \"towers\". Well we soon found this was no \"Trump Tower\"... :-) The tower looked huge and dated and even the elevators looked and felt old... The rooms were not too bad, but definitely not of the quality of something with the word \"Resort\" in its name! The carpet was blue and plush and that was different. We were on the sixth floor and there was a small balcony overlooking the pool. It was a bit scary leaning on the railing hoping that it wouldn't give seeing as how the builiding seemed pretty old...... The TV worked, with quite a few channels to choose from but the reception on more than a few of the channels was not good. My biggest pet peeve though was the bathroom just didn't make the grade for me for a place called \"Town and Country RESORT\". It was just about as basic as a Motel 6 I think. Luckily everything worked. Found it interesting though that the showerhead was at eye level to me, and I am by no means a tall person! It was kind of uncomfortable having to bend your knees to have the water run down on your head. Other than those things, which might not bother some people, it was an o.k. stay. The BEST thing was the walk to the trolley station was only about a two minute walk... That was great. Also, after the game was over, we wanted to grab something to eat and wound up coming in out of the rain and entering a piano lounge that was part of the steakhouse there on the premises. The bartender was kind enough to offer us a booth in the corner and give us menus since there was a small line for the regular restaurant part of the place... He let us sit in the lounge and order food which I thought was really cool of him.... Even though the food was overpriced, we tipped him pretty good once we finished. Anyway, to sum it up, we only stayed there for one cold and drizzly night so we couldn't really enjoy the greenery and fountains. Not a bad stay, but I expected our room to be a lot nicer. Maybe if we had upgraded to one of the more expensive rooms that are more isolated, we would have stayed out of the gray unimpressive \"Towers\". Oh one more thing.... We heard doors opening and closing for what seemed like all night long, so I hope you're a heavy sleeper! And there was an $8 fee for parking. Would I stay here again? Probably Not.

I felt like I was actually able toexperience San Diego even while the event was going on plus the access to the trolley is fantastic! Most of our group took advantage of the easy transportation to zip around the city for dinner. The staff is amazing - they keep the place immaculate and gorgeous. The hotel underwent millions of dollars in rennovations in the past year or so and it shows. Yes, it was built in the 1950s and has the architecture of that era. If you want a slick Marriott or Hyatt or Sheraton or such, choose that but if you want a lovely resort experience with flowers and pools and lazy, long walks on the rose garden grounds then definitely come here.

GREAT food breaks for our conference participants and it's nice to have five restuarants on site for those who cannot leave the property - lots of options.

I went along for the beautiful sites and weather of southern California. We paid the extra out of pocket for an upgrade to a \"premium king bed Royal Palm Tower\". When we arrived after a cross-country flight, It was fairly late in the evening. We were told that our room would be 3539...\"not in the palm tower...but just as nice\". The first thing that hit us as we opened the door, was the unbearable smell of mildew. I mean, it made my eyes water. As we entered the room, ready to collapse from exhaustion, the next thing we realized was that we weren't going to be sleeping anytime soon. I understand being green,,,and not using the AC except when the room is in use, but it was 80 degrees in there. That might have been tolerable, had it not been for rhe fact that due to the extreme need for a dehumidified, every surface in the room..including the sheets and pillowcases, ranged from damp to down right wet. We turned up the AC full blast, and went out for a late dinner. Unfortunately, when we got back, we realized that the AC was on it's last legs... I called the front desk, and told them that the AC needed service. When they sent the maintenance man over, he asked us why we were staying in this section. I explained that we had reserved the palm tower, but were told that these were identical. He looked at me incredulously, and said that we might want to check that out for ourselves...that the hotel was nowhere near full. I immediately called the front desk, and asked why we had been downgraded, and were still paying the same rate. I was told that there were \"no king non-smoking rooms available\". I explained that I was unhappy with the state of the room. The desk clerk said that she could put me in a queen smoking room in the tower. I reminded her that I PAID for a king NS. At which point she said \"sorry, that's all I can do\". My husband said we could try the smoking room, but I can't imagine adding smoke to mildew...not a great picture. I waited 20 minutes and picked up my cell phone and called reservations and asked for a king NS in the royal palm tower, for 3 nights...and you guessed it...They could accomodate me...

This is a really odd hotel and I'm not quite sure what type of traveler it is built for. Its not in an ideal location to be a relaxing resort, its not nice enough to be a good conference center, and its too expensive to be a budget hotel. First of all you have the location, on I-8 just east of I-5. While you're within a short drive of most of the San Diego area, you aren't really anywhere of interest. You're not downtown, not by the ocean, just kind of out among lots of other hotels. The property is large and spread out. Upon first look, it appears to be something out of 1960's Florida. There are several buildings and each contains different types of rooms. I stayed in the tower, which is at the back end (north end) of the property. It's about eight levels and has exterior corridors. Almost all rooms have a view of the pool below. The room I received was damp and dank, even with the air conditioner running all day. While it wasn't noticeably dirty, everything seemed to be sticky and there was a musty smell to the room. The bed was a murphy bed (pulled down from the wall). The TV cabinet doors would not stay open unless propped. There was a door that joined with the room next door that was paper thin and didn't even reach the floor. I could hear the slightest noise from the room next door, including every time the water was turned on and every footstep on the floor. Fortunately my neighbor was another business traveler, so there wasn't much noise from the room. After speaking with others who were staying in some of the other buildings on the property, it seems the tower offers the largest rooms. My room had a wet bar and mini-fridge as well as a couch and dining table. Rooms in the other buildings apparently did not have these amenities. The tower rooms also have a balcony. Even at the discounted conference rate, this hotel was no deal. Add on a $14 per day parking fee (no reason for it given the location) and a charge for internet, and this hotel is no value whatsoever. I was able to get around the internet fee by connecting to the wireless signal from the cafe below my room. For some reason that access was free and the signal was even stronger than the regular hotel signal. There are some aspects of the resort that were acceptable. The grounds are nice to stroll around (although it's easy to get lost or turned around). There are trees and rose gardens everywhere. There are also a couple pools that looked well maintained. The staff at the convention center was excellent. Fast and attentive. There is also a large shopping mall just north of the property, just across a small river and a street. There are plenty of dining options within the resort as well as a few at the mall, all within easy walking distance. But those aspects don't make up for the drawbacks or the high price.

Reservation requested room in the courtyard of one of the pools. I confirmed this at check in. In short the room was down the hall from the pool not a courtyard room and worse the windows backed on to the parking traffic and staff smoking area. Worse yet the pool nearest to us was closed. We asked to move rooms and were given one in the rose garden. Very nice room but a walk across a driveway to the operating pool - not a courtyard (we have a 5 and 7 yearold). Requested to be moved to a courtyard to the pool for the next night. We were told we'd have to wait and call in the morning? Why? I don't know - don't they know who's checking out the nite before? Anyway it was too complicated to try to reason with the front desk. The second nite we were moved to a room in the courtyard to the pool!! We were happy but disappointed when the kids said that pool is freezing - I asked the front desk and she tells me that only the pool we had moved away from was heated. This info may have come in handy had we not just moved to our third room in 2 nights. In the end the kids walked 1/2 a block to the warm pool most nights. The hot water to the tub did not work right - it was extremely finnicky on how to get the magic 11 o'clock angle to get the hot water but after 30 minutes my husband figured it out. The only great thing was the bellmen they were all great and very helpful in moving our luggage from room to room and in suggesting places to eat and go out to.", "Date": "August 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palm Springs", "Title": "\u201cWe come here every year for our Wedding Anniversary\u201d", "Author": "mmoreno24", "ReviewID": "UR38048682", "Content": "Our family loves to stay at Town and Country resort in San Diego.

I book at this hotel 10 months in advance asking for a room with two queen beds and on a high floor. The day I arrived they couldnt give me my booking as they were booked out so we were put in a room with one queen bed on the 4th floor and the bed was a pulldown bed from the wall at 209.00 a night. There was an adjoining door with the room next door and even quiet talk we might as well as of been sitting with each other on the sofa cause you could hear every word said. The bed was really old as were the pillows god knew when they had last been replaced there wasn't much stuffing left in them at all. We did ask for more but they were as bad as the ones we already had. the couple above us like to have sex 100 times a night and there is no insulation so lets just say they might as well be laying beside us we could hear every single movement. It was so noisy at night people running down the hallways etc. One night they rented out one of the rooms for an event and we had to listen to the loud music played there till 10.30pm at night. When we complained was told there was nothing they could do as it was booked out for them till 10.30pm. We had booked for 10 nights but we left two days early as we could just not take the noise the uncomfortable bed anymore. I was charged fully for the room for the two nights we did not stay plus and extra $100.00 per night for leaving early. After 3 international phone calls at my own expensive I am still fighting with them to get this money refunded as they say it is their policy to charge for early departure. They staff were not friendly at all and have been down right rude at trying to get our money back. I keep getting put on hold and told someone will call me back to which this has not happened as of yet. No matter what time of the day I call San Diego time I am told that there is no manager onsite to deal with this issue. Do not stay at this hotel you would do better sleeping on the side of the road. The rooms are old and in need for some furbreeze it is very noisy and they staff don't care and have no customer service at all. It really did spoil part of our holiday to America.

A catered banquet was held the first night of our conference which had food far beyond my taste expectations for an event for that many people. There were several restaurants on the grounds which allowed for some variability in food, but it was all fairly expensive. The service of the staff was in general friendly, but one particular server Angelica Stephens at Trellises Garden Grill truly made us feel like the resort was a home away from home. She always wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves and asked about our out of resort excursions. For shopping and other eating opportunities there is a nice mall just behind the hotel.

For our yearly week-long conference of 2000 attendees, the T&C is able to accommodate all of meeting space needs, sleeping rooms at a reasonable rate, delicious catering, and onsite AV. We have held our conference at the T&C for the past 15 years, and have come to feel like the T&C extended family. What I find truly amazing (and rare) is that the majority of the staff has been there for many years. This consistency is so nice for a Conference Planner, as the T&C staff understands our mission, and works very hard to help us reach our goals for our attendees. In working closely with the directors of Sales/Marketing, Convention Services, Food and Beverage, and AV, I find them to all be highly professional. They are all approachable, friendly, reliable, experienced, dedicated, and extremely hard workers\u2026giving over 100% consistently. They are very much a \u201cfamily\u201d, which shows in all their dealings with staff and guests. When I walk around the beautifully landscaped property, every staff member that I meet is friendly and always willing to assist with any needs. I find their attitude to be refreshing, and always sincere. There are several restaurants onsite, which makes it very convenient for the conference attendees. The restaurants choices range from a fun casual sports bar to beautiful fine dining with fabulous food. There is a beautiful Spa onsite with many amenities. I highly recommend the hot stone massage, a truly amazing experience! San Diego is such a beautiful, wonderful city with many attractions, but can be costly at times, and without a car may be challenging for visitors to navigate. However, for a resort, the T&C is an affordable destination in the very convenient location of Hotel Circle, with the trolley station (and Fashion Valley Shopping Mall) in walking distance. On the trolley, you can navigate easily to many parts of the city including San Diego\u2019s Old Town and the downtown Gaslamp area for lots of fun and good food. The world famous San Diego Zoo, Sea World, and International Airport are each within several miles of the T&C\u2026all very convenient.

I found a 3 star resort on Hotwire and decided to give it a try. When we arrived at the hotel, we found total chaos at the front counter. We were given instructions to our room and when we opened the door, we found a king size bed with bed taking up the entire room. Because there was 3 of us, 1 being an 11 year old, I called Town & Country after I booked on Hotwire and was assured we were given a no smoking room with two beds. We drove back up to the front counter and explained that we needed two beds and we were given a king size bed. The employee stated since Town & Country was a resort, they only guaranteed a room, not anything else. I asked why I was told by an employee of Town & Country that we were given a no smoking room with two beds. The employee changed her story to our room being occupied by some people who wouldn't leave. Right beside me during this exchange was a lady who was at the counter when we checked in which was about 30 minutes ago. Turns out, she booked on Orbitz and Town & Country was claiming they didn't receive the reservation. All evidence was pointing to Town & Country overbooking and now they didn't have enough rooms. I told the employee that she was going call Hotwire and explain to them that they did not have the room that was promised. She did call Hotwire and told the employee that I did not find the facility acceptable so the Hotwire employee asked to speak with me. I explained the situation to Hotwire and was told they would refund the price immediately and asked to speak with the Town & Country employee. The Hotwire employee asked the Town & Country employee if they were going to find alternate arrangements for us and was told no. By this time, I had been lied to so much that I just wanted to leave and never come back. As I was leaving, I noticed the lady who had booked through Orbitz was still there without a room. Luckily, I had joined AAA before I left and had their California book with us. We called several hotels in the area and eventually found a Comfort Inn Hotel & Suites not far away. This room was much nicer and larger than the room at Town & Country plus parking was only $5.00 a day instead of the $14.00 charged at Town & Country. Why Town & Country Resort survives is beyond me.

There are modern towers and quaint bungalows spread out across the vast acreage. There are also some extremely average old, apartment-style rooms sprinkled into the mix. Unfortunately, I got one of those rooms in October 2008. For the privilege of staying in room #3714, I paid $169 for a Saturday night and $189 for a Sunday night. One earlier reviewer said this was \"Motel rooms at hotel prices\" and I think that nails it on the head. The hotel complex is so huge that you need a printed map to figure out where you are and where you're going and there are also maps with the familiar \"you are here\" arrow spread out over the grounds. My room was quite difficult to find, due mainly to the fact that the well-meaning but clueless young woman on the front desk who checked me in told me the room was on the first floor when it was indeed on the SECOND FLOOR instead. Whoops! Strike one. The room, once I found it, was very average. The bedroom and bathroom felt small and cramped. The bed was very comfortable, though although the bedspread and room decorations were old and tired. It had an old, small TV and the balcony looked out to the back side of one of the many meeting and convention facilities on the \"Resort\" property. I put \"Resort\" in quotes because, even though there are a few nice areas of the hotel complex, I felt that the room I got stuck with dispelled the notion that I was at a resort. The \"view\" was a joke, unless you like looking at the back side of another building ten feet away. I heard a great deal of noise from the rooms next door and below me, and even more noise from the hotel's maintenance, landscaping and housekeeping staffs wheeling their carts right outside. I had stayed at this hotel several years ago and stayed in one of the Towers, which made a great deal of difference. I enjoyed that stay a lot more than I enjoyed this one. This is not to say my stay this year was a total loss. The T&C is quite close to the Trolley line that runs east-west and is quite convenient to travel around San Diego. There's a mediocre but serviceable golf course next door and a great deal of shopping available in Mission Valley. The T&C property does have a couple of pools, but some of them are much nicer than others. The one near the lobby and one of the resort's restaurants is decent, but the one outside one of the towers is quite noisy, and there's another small pool in the courtyard of one series of rooms that reminded me of a Motel 6. Not all was average here: I enjoyed two wonderful breakfasts sitting in the San Diego sunshine outside the Trellises restaurant.

I hadn't read any reviews whatsoever about the place before heading there, so I didn't have any preconceived notions about what I would find, other than the pictures on the hotel's website. Needless to say, the hotel is completely unacceptable as a business destination. So, where to begin... * Accommodations The room we stayed in was in one of the hotel's two towers, known as the Regency. The hotel was decrepit. Everywhere you look, paint is scraped and chipped, lightbulbs are burnt out (and allowed to stay that way), windows have dirt in the corners, there are dings in the walls and door jambs, and other such problems. Our room itself has obviously not been updated since the late 80's, to include the comforter, which was faded and frayed. The bathroom is lit by two dim bulbs, which is fine, since brighter light would have drawn even more attention to the stained bathtub, yellowed and peeling grout, and rusty hinges on the door. The door itself looks like it has been repeatedly urinated on, as it is streaked yellow. The air conditioning in our room was so pitiful that we ran it non-stop from the time we arrived to the time we left, and it was never able to bring the room temp below 72\u00ba. It was also unable to remove the mugginess from the air. We slept with the window open the first night, but, sad to say, our room faced the San Diego Herald-Tribune loading docks, so at 3:30 AM we were assailed with the crash of tractor-trailers backing up to receive shipments of newspapers. The window stayed closed after that. The grounds were beautiful, with rose bushes everywhere, and arbors, trellises, and cute little architectural touches in abundance. Of course, many of those touches, such as ornamental scrollwork, were straight from Home Depot and simply glued in place and painted; they were often askew or chipped and peeling. It was the equivalent of adding as much garnish to a dinner plate as possible to try and hide the fact that the main course was only so much boiled shoe-leather. In addition to everything else, our toilet stopped flushing on the second day. After we called maintenance to fix it, it wouldn't stop flushing. It's feast or famine at the Town & Country. Speaking of famine... * Food Business travelers and convention-goers are usually on a time crunch, as they have only so much time to eat and then be back at the next session or class. The food service at the hotel was so slow that a number of us had to skip meals or eat cold cuts from the deli; when you have only an hour and it takes 40 minutes to get just your drinks, there is a problem. The food was also sub-par; the breakfast buffet at the Terrace Cafe is to be avoided at all costs. The food is cold, rubbery, and of a quality well below that of most fast-food places. The ribs at Kelly's Steakhouse were overdone and dried out, as was the BBQ chicken; the only thing worth eating was the appetizer. Charlie's Bar & Grill was agonizingly slow and overpriced; $13 hamburgers and expensive sodas can quickly eat up your per-diem allowance. * Connectivity As a business traveler, it is essential to stay connected to the office, and Internet access is a key part of that for anyone operating in the 21st century. Here, too, the Town and Country was a let-down. With no wired access, you are forced to purchase ($3 an hour or $10 for 24 hours) wi-fi access through a vendor called LodgeNet. However, the access was so spotty that I was unable to reliably check email, and had to spend over ninety minutes on the phone with LodgeNet tech support to even get connected. * Staff The front-office staff were professional to the point of being brusque, but I only had to deal with them rarely. The waitstaff at Kelly's were utterly clueless, even to the point of failing to unlock the front door on time (we had to go in through the lounge and then tell them that the door was still locked). The waitstaff at Charlie's were arrogant and ignorant of the needs of the customers. The only two places I found excellent staff were at the Trellises restaurant and the in the housekeeping staff. At Trellises, both Angelica and Jesus, and a third gentleman whose name I didn't catch, were charming and responsive, and the food was excellent. As for the housekeeping staff, they did an excellent job with what they had to work with, and our housekeeper took extra special care with my boys' stuffed animals and even hung our wet swimsuits back up after having cleaned the bathroom. * Conclusions Overall, the front-line staff are doing the best they can in the absence of involved and commited top management, which may either be uninterested or incapable of improving the place. The Town and Country has the feeling of a sinking cruise liner; the band is still playing, but the ship is getting lower and lower in the water, and it is only a matter of time before it slips beneath the waves. Unless it is saved by a rescuer with an infusion of cash and competence, the Town and Country does not have much longer to live. I have already sent a note to our central education office (of a government agency with 160,000 employees) asking them to avoid scheduling us at this hotel in the future.", "Date": "August 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bay Area, CA", "Title": "\u201cAverage Stay\u201d", "Author": "noslengnow", "ReviewID": "UR19247353", "Content": "Stayed here as part of the San Diego Comic Con room block.

Hotel room was small and very dated decor (country style) but for us it was just a place to sleep and rest so we didn't much mind the decor.

We took advantage of the trolley location to get to Downtown San Diego and it was pretty convenient. Checkout as a bit weird though. We attempted to checkout via the television system and it told us that we couldn't check out through that until 11:10 a.m., which is 10 minutes beyond the actual check out time. We ended up driving back up to the lobby and checking out there. The line was 5 or 6 people deep so it took about 15 minutes. All told, driving back to the front and waiting in line probably used up 20 to 25 minutes that we could saved had the television checkout been working properly. Overall minor quibbles though. The convenient location for us definitely was a plus in an otherwise average hotel stay.", "Date": "August 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati", "Title": "\u201cDon't waste your time here--go elsewhere on Hotel Circle\u201d", "Author": "CincinnatiTrav_l_r", "ReviewID": "UR19057648", "Content": "Stayed here with a previous conference a few years back--even staying on the company's dime, I would absolutely not recommend this \"resort\" (?).

Yes, folks, there are indeed hotel rooms without beds?!?!? Not to mention that the room had been reserved for nearly two months, so what happened to our room? Okay, whatever...the kids and I are tired from being in planes and airports for the past 6 hours. Have to wait for the only bellhop in the place (yes, only one on a busy Saturday night and the place was hopping). He takes a large group off to their room--we can't walk to ours w/ our bags and a brass luggage cart because the staff \"can't allow guests to use them\" (oddly enough, they stay chained up to posts around the property). So we wait, and wait...and wait some more. The 6 minutes slowly turned into 25 minutes :( Ugh...tired, grumpy kids... Make it to the bed-less hotel room (via golf cart because it's all of a 2-minute ride and all) and they have a portable cot/bed delivered. There is a pullout sofa bed in the room, but it's so paper thin and uncomfortable that we are forced to actually rearrange heavy furniture in this room so that my youngest can sleep on two overstuffed chairs that are facing each other. Sigh... Paid $35 for two kids' buffets and 1 adult buffet for breakfast the next morning since we were all starving from our travels. The food was below par, although the service was great. I found this to be true throughout the stay. The maids and waitstaff were courteous and friendly, while the \"professional\" staff up front could learn some customer service lessons from these hardworking folks! Honestly!!!! To add insult to injury, I make it over to the supposed state-of-the-art workout facility (I can't vouch for this because I didn't actually go into it OR see anyone using it at any point in passing by) on the grounds inside of the day spa (also, not busy) to be greeted by the less-than-enthusiastic desk person by, \"Oh, are you staying here with a conference?\" I reply with, \"Well, yes I am.\" Then: \"Oh, they must have forgotten to tell you about the fee for use: $8/day.\" WHAT??? I'm paying $14 per day to park, ungodly markup on ho-hum food, overpriced (not to mention old and run-down furnishings in the) room, and now I'm nickle-and-dimed to workout??? I immediately left, of course, only to watch another fellow walk in and right back out. Who pays to use a treadmill at a hotel? I'm sure the Vagabond Inn around the corner has a free workout facility. In the end, I'm sure the management will kindly thank me for my feedback and apologetically promise to look into the issues I raised (as you've probably read in the other 150+ previous reviews). But, it's obvious to anyone and everyone reading these that the management is NOT willing to follow through with this because the same complaints would not be consistently arising. Okay, management, let's here a real game plan on turning this place around?!?!?! All in all, save your money and stay somewhere else on Hotel Circle.

The reason for the trip was to visit San Diego State University which he will be attending next year as a freshman. We stayed at Town and Country Resort Hotel for 3 days recommended by the AAA, and here's my review; 1) Checking-in to the Town and Country hotel was a nightmare! There were no/limited temporary parking spaces for hotel guests. The only parking lot that was available was blocked in and was for the paying customers only. Just as other hotel guests trying to find someplace to park their car, we were driving around and around in circles looking for open spots anywhere on the side of the building since there were no parking on the street. We ended up parking on the the driveway for hotel delivery truck. Many of the cars were double parked and drivers were fighting over an illegal parking space. It was a total pandemonium with and cars traveling in both directions on this narrow corridor in front of the entrance with either driver wanting to budge. 2) As expected there were long lines with people waiting to check-in (That resembles airport check-in) with lines curved around several times in front of lobby. The line was moving very slow due to only half of the front counter were open/manned and some of the guests were frustrated and cranky. After the mayhem outside the hotel fighting over a parking spot who could blame them. After about 20 minutes of waiting it was my turn. When I heard \"Next in line\" I stepped up to the counter. The customer service person behind the desk must be having a bad day by the way she moved about the behind the counter and from the way she handled my paperwork. When I mentioned to her about the parking situation/experience, she seemed unsympathetic. 3) After first night of stay, a maid left a (One liter bottle of water) in our room that says $2.50 if the seal is broken. This is not a complimentary bottle of water mind you. Anyway, I wasn't dying of thirst so we left that bottle of water alone. Later on that evening we ordered an In-room dining service; two small plate of something called California fruit palette and (Although there were no bottle water listed on their menu) 4 bottles of water. After the food delivery guy who banged on our front door continuously until we opened the door, as if we didn't hear after the first bang, we received our tray of food. The total bill came to whopping $70.00 dollars!! When I read the itemized receipt, to my surprise $5.00 per 20 oz bottle water X 4 = $20.00! I should've just opened the one liter bottle of water that was sitting on the desk for just $2.50. I don't get it. When I asked the person working at the front desk how do you justify charging $5.00 for 20 0z bottle of water from the kitchen and then you leave one liter bottle in the room for $2.50? He had a very puzzled look on his face but gave me no answer. 4) If you like bugs there were plenty of that in our room. Our room guest consist of: one \"Earwig\" bug in our sink to greet us and two pretty good size spiders crawling around our ceiling doing tricks. Bugs don't bother us, however, something to watch for in your room if you have family members who are afraid of the bugs. 5) I've traveled all over the United States and stayed in many of the major hotel chains, and Town and Country hotel is our first that we have stayed that charges parking fee. When our son attends San Diego State University next year to play football we will be visiting San Diego often, however, Town and Country will NOT be on our list of hotel we would want to stay.

Likewise, the buffet wasn't included in the cost of our rate as we were charged tax on it! (Not like at typical places that include breakfast bars, really odd.) - Parking, $8/day adds up. You don't pay for parking at other nearby hotels. - Service staff. They were really professional. In fact, TOO professional for me. We at the same place every morning for 7 days.

The first night I got there, they stated that we would be put in to a suite with a couch bed (translation: semisuite) and that we would have to leave the room the next day and move into a regular room. Although the room was really nice and had an outside patio that goes to the pool, the inconvenience of having to check out and check in did not set well with me, especially when I had a seminar in the morning that I needed to attend to. However, they did take some responsibility and redeemed themselves by offering me and my wife a password for free internet use access (which is $10.00 per day value) and since I just bought a macbook the day before, my wife was happy with that. Mind you, other than the check in process, the hotel is a very nice place to stay. They take good care of their area and their gardens and the paths/walkways were gorgeous with a splendid assortment of roses, plants, and fountains fixated all over the place which would make any high school prom want to book this place. It is, funny to say, a labyrinth of twists and turns (and actually a dead end in one area between the pool/check in lobby) which makes you feel like you are in Frances Hodgson Burnett's \"The Secret Garden\" rather than a hotel resort. Also, as you and as you cross though the bridge to the behind the hotel to go through the Fashion Valley Mall (a superb outdoor mall!), you have to cross the small San Diego river. People just pass by it to go to the mall, but it is a really nice area with ducks waddling around and squirrels going to and fro the area as a more natural California scene from balboa park (which is driving distance to the area). For the two rooms that I stayed, they were really nice. The suite was furnished with a basic kitchenette of a microwave and an empty compact refrigerator which was wasn\u2019t stocked with drinks where the hotel would charge you up the ying yang for (although they offer a litter of aquafina for a $2.50 convenience charge). The d\u00e9cor of the area was really nice with vases and plants and an outside patio to the pool. The second room that I stayed in was a regular one bedroom king size room equipped with the standard amenities. The inside room had a lovely blue theme and bed was comfortable with a nice view being on the third floor. Now, if you have the money for the high rollers, if you get a presidential suite on the tenth floor like my boss had, you will be sitting in first class with Donald Trump. Equipped with a nice indoor bar, ample space to throw an executive party and a gorgeous view of the resort, seeing this room was definitely one of the highlights of my trip. They even have a little potted tree bush the size of a tiny christmas on the left and right side of the doorway before you enter the room, now that's class! The staff was very competent in what they do and was very friendly and accommodating in whatever I needed. My family sent me a special package, and the people in the front desk were very helpful in assisting me to get my package safely and securely. It was funny because when I left the last day, the guy that helped in for the bell hop area next to the front desk remembered me and waived good bye to me, and that is the personalized service that I enjoy. All in all, the Town and Country is a wonderful place to stay.

I have just returned home from having attended a conference at the Town and Country from February 13-16, 2008. I too had read many less than favourable reviews about the resort, and so was not quite sure what to expect. However, my companions and I were more than pleasantly surprised by the facilities, service, and staff at the resort, and I was resolved to write my own positive review after returning home. We arrived at the resort shortly after noon on our day of arrival to find that our room was not yet ready (check-in isn't supposed to be until 3 PM, after all). The only room available was one without a view (the brick wall mentioned by other reviewers), and so we opted to wait for another. The front desk staff were most apologetic, and quickly called for the bell captain to store our luggage until later. As it happened, we did not have to wait until 3 PM for our room; our luggage was retrieved and we were transported by golf cart to the Royal Palm Tower. Derek then brought our luggage right up to our room for us, too! Our double room on the 9th floor was directly off the elevator lobby, but we were never disturbed by noise from the elevator, guests in adjoining rooms, or the freeway. We had a lovely view of the entire resort and the surrounding hills from our balcony, which was furnished with a white wrought iron table and chairs. Our room was quite spacious, and was furnished with dark colonial-style furniture. The 2 queen-sized beds were separated by a writing desk and chair, 2 armchairs flanked another round table, a long dressing bench sat under the picture of the little girl in the blue dress (very cute!), and an armoire housed the TV over three drawers for clothing. The dark blue carpet looked to be quite new, and the bedspreads matched the draperies and pleated valances over the beds. Our room also had a second sink and counter in the dressing area outside the bathroom - very handy when three women are sharing a room! The mirrored sliding doors on the closet were appreciated, as was the heatlamp on a timer in the bathroom. The weather on one day of our stay was cool and rainy - between 45 & 50 degrees - but the heat in our room worked very well to keep us absolutely comfortable. By the way, a photo posted by another reviewer is a bit misleading: of course all of the rooms in the Royal Palm Tower have windows! The photo is actually a shot of the open-air corridors along the BACK side of the tower from which the rooms are accessed. We were very impressed by the conference facilities at the Town and Country. In addition to the main exhibit hall and ballrooms, the resort has a multitude of break-out rooms of various sizes. Sumptuous carpets, mirrors, and crystal chandeliers adorn the foyers, and the restrooms feature marble countertops and tiled floors. The banks of smaller meeting rooms are separated by walkways bordered by well-kept flowerbeds and many benches and tables for further conversation. The only caution I would give regarding the facilities is that the sheer size of the resort requires quite a bit of walking back and forth from your accommodations to various conference facilities - a consideration for anyone with mobility issues. We also enjoyed our meals at the Town & Country Resort. The breakfast buffet at the Terrace Cafe does offer a good variety of hot and cold choices - certainly more than we could eat - and the regular menu for all meals has something for everyone. Our final dinner at Trellises Garden Grille was more expensive, but was delicious and beautifully presented. I can't say enough about the two banquets we enjoyed - one of roast beef and the other of chicken breasts stuffed with spinach! Beautifully cooked - beef still pink inside, vegetables crisp-tender, all piping hot, despite service for over 1000 attendees! Prompt service by unfailingly pleasant and accommodating wait staff. Oh, and the desserts! TOO decadent! We found that the Town & Country Resort was located quite centrally for all of our needs. It was only a 10-15 minute shuttle ride from the airport, and was a maximum 5-10 minute walk from the Fashion Valley trolley stop. It was quite easy to take the trolley system downtown to Seaport Village. And the Fashion Valley Mall begins just the other side of the transit centre/trolley stop. In summary, I would not hesitate to visit the Town & Country Resort again. The facility is quite charming and very clean, and the flowers and landscaping are beautiful. The staff were unfailingly pleasant and eager to assist whenever needed. My only regret is that our conference was not longer!", "Date": "February 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southern Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cA Positive Experience at the Town and Country!\u201d", "Author": "gjkov", "ReviewID": "UR13652696", "Content": "After reading all the negative reviews, we were also more than a bit apprehensive about our stay at the Town and Country. But since that is where our conference was being held, we had little choice. So we went into it trying to have as positive an attitude as we could, and I am pleased to say we were delighted to have had a very different experience. It was almost as if we were staying at a different resort! Please bear with a rather long review, as we feel we\u2019d like to share the positives. We are simple middle class people who do a fair amount of traveling, mostly staying in mid range accomodations (Marriott, Hilton Garden Inns and Hamptons, Holiday Inns and the like). From the moment we arrived, all the staff was never anything but pleasant and helpful. This included the front desk, cleaning and other support people, restaurant staff, concierge staff, conference center people, as well as several higher level managers we encountered and talked with one day. I can honestly say we never encountered a crabby staff person during the week. We were booked in the Royal Palm tower, and having read about some of the rooms with views of brick walls, we specifically requested a middle room with balcony overlooking the pool area when checking in. We were nicely accommodated with this request\u2026.as with the few others we made during our stay. When we got to our room we found we were close to the elevator\u2026which we had read was a problem for another reviewer in regard to noise. But we were never disturbed by noise from the elevator or any of the rooms around us. We never even heard any noise from the rooms around us and we knew people were staying in them. There was staff with golf carts to help you bring your bags to your room, if needed. We had a rental car, so did not need that service, but we never had trouble finding a convenient parking spot, as some other reviewers spoke of. We could see that there were not as many parking spots by the garden bungalows, so maybe was not as easy to park there, but we never had any trouble in the big lot by the Royal Palm. And some spoke of roads within the resort that were hard to navigate, but we never had trouble with that. It is a rather big place, but not that big. It was a nice, couple minute walk from our building to the lobby area, which were on opposite ends of the resort. Our Royal Palm room was very spacious and nicely appointed; with a king bed, easy chair and ottoman, small table and chair as well as a writing desk. There was also the armoire with TV, bed tables and both floor and table lamps in various locations around the room that provided good lighting. The balcony had 2 comfortable padded chairs and a small table and we enjoyed time out there every day. The bathroom was spacious and had an outer area with a counter and sink, as well as the sink in the actual bathroom. I will agree that the shower head was mounted very low, but if that was the worst thing wrong, we certainly could easily deal with it. There was a large closet, too, with plenty of hangers. And though the comforter was not of a design I would choose for my bed at home (as with most hotels), it was certainly not objectionable. And besides being comfortable, the room was very clean and cleaned nicely each day throughout our stay. I read a number of reviews that mentioned the proximity of the freeway. And while it did run close to the front of the resort and we could see the traffic from our balcony, we could barely hear any noise with it. Even in early morning when the resort was very quiet, so it never disturbed us in the least. Was it very scenic? Not really and certainly not like looking at the ocean, but those rooms on the coast have much heftier price tags attached, too. And since the layout of the resort was so nice; with trees, lovely gardens and flowers, pools, etc, it was not hard to overlook the freeway. The grounds were also kept very clean. There were always cleaning crews out first thing in the morning cleaning the pool and other common areas. And besides doing a great job, they were also quick to return a smile and a greeting. The pools and whirlpool looked very clean and though we did not use them, heard many good things from folks in our conference who did. There was some construction going on, as they were renovating some areas, but it was very easy to get around and did not disturb us in any way. Food at the resort was a little on the expensive side, but no more so than in other restaurants we ate in around San Diego. And all the food we had was very well prepared, portions more than adequate and wait staff very pleasant. The breakfast buffet was especially nice, with good hot food and many choices; scrambled eggs, potatoes, bacon, sausage, pancakes, french toast, beautiful fresh fruit, cereals and a multitude of bread and pastry choices. Some thought it was a little expensive at $14.50, but included all beverages, so really was not much more than breakfast with juice and coffee at someplace like Perkins and was all you could eat. The Terrace also had nice salads, sandwiches and great homemade soups along with some other entrees and a fresh fish choice each day, making it a good choice for any meal of the day. The Trellis is a little more upscale and rather expensive for dinner (we thought), but we had a very nice lunch there. Kelly\u2019s Steakhouse has nice dinner offerings in midrange pricing. We never ate at Charlie\u2019s but heard from others it was also quite good. You can also easily walk over to the mall, which has a variety of restaurants in all price ranges. The convention center was large, but once you got the lay of the land, it was not hard to navigate. The convention staff was also very nice and the meals we were provided during our conference were excellent! All in all we had a very good experience with the Town and Country and loved our stay in San Diego.", "Date": "February 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary", "Title": "\u201cA rebuttal of the great staff I experienced\u201d", "Author": "JimmyR", "ReviewID": "UR13456899", "Content": "I stayed at the Town and Country for 8 days in the last week of January, 2008 while at a week long convention.

I went back at 2:30 and was placed in 1132, an excellent ground floor room that actually walked out to a large patio that I used everyday. I used room service on three occasions and found the food to be of good quality and reasonably priced. And a large pizza is really large....and will feed 4 people easily. A co-worker requested a room change later in the week as her spouse was arriving with their 18 month old......this was handled with ease and they were allocated a room close by to us so that they could sit outside at night and use their baby monitor to llisten to their child.

My brother, a San Diego resident, made reservations for us at the Town & Country, via Expedia, months ahead of time. He also used Expedia to pay, and to request 4 double queen rooms. At check-in, we were given four double queen rooms, but told that we would have to move to different rooms after the first night. No explanation was given at the time, but we were told by Javier, the night manager, that the new rooms would be an upgrade, that they would be double queens, and that he would comp our three days\u2019 parking (parking is a hefty $14/day) and two days\u2019 breakfasts. Now, when I arrive at a hotel, I really want to unpack and settle in - and I don\u2019t want to worry about packing again until it\u2019s time to leave. I absolutely detest the unsettled feeling of staying one night here and one night there, even if it\u2019s different rooms in the same hotel. So Javier\u2019s news that we would be moving after the first night was anything but welcome. The comps were something, as was his assurance that we\u2019d be getting better rooms, but bottom line, they weren\u2019t worth the hassle we were looking at in changing rooms. The property is huge and sprawling. It\u2019s like a small community, albeit a community that never understood the point of a planning commission. There\u2019s a bit of parking here, a bit there, and even a parking structure \u2013 but we didn\u2019t see an actual entrance to that, so it didn\u2019t do us any good. We drove to the building where our four rooms were located, and circled the surrounding area a couple of times looking for parking, but there was none within the same Zip code as the rooms; we ended up parking just this side of Tijuana. To add to our delight, the rooms were on the second floor of a somewhat ratty old building, with no elevator, so once we humped our bags from the car to the building, we hauled them up an outdoor concrete staircase. It was starting to dawn on us that this was not so much a hotel, as a motel with pretensions. The rooms were small, a bit shabby, and one had a funny smell that gave my daughter a headache within seconds of entering, but they were non-smoking double queen rooms, and all four of our rooms were in the same small cell-block, er, building. The room design was a bit odd; I didn\u2019t even find the closet for several hours. (Note: in my defense, I didn\u2019t actually spend those hours searching for a closet. When I didn\u2019t spot one right off the bat, I just assumed there wasn\u2019t one, and was therefore surprised to discover one later, sort of tucked behind the sink.) There was no point in unpacking, but there was not sufficient space to accommodate an open suitcase, as we were being thrown out the next morning anyway. We finally cleared the hotel\u2019s junk from the wooden table to put an open suitcase on it. I awoke early the next morning, increasingly frustrated at how we were being treated. In particular, it kept going through my mind that the only reason for moving us from our block of four rooms was that the hotel was more interested in accommodating the new guests than in making our group happy. At around 6, I got dressed and ventured to the lobby to see if they could do any better for us. I spoke with Christina at the desk. On a map, she showed me where our new rooms would be, circling an area encompassing multiple buildings, while she tried to sound like the rooms were somehow close together. She, too, assured me that we would have double queen rooms. I mentioned the lack of convenient parking, and she pointed out a number of parking lots around the periphery of the property. Perhaps there were parking spaces in those far-flung lots; perhaps there are parking spaces on the moon, too, but they wouldn\u2019t do us much good, being nowhere near our rooms. Anyway, Christina said that they would make the move as hassle-free as they could, and we at least wouldn\u2019t have to wait through the check-in line again. After packing what little we\u2019d bothered to unpack, we had breakfast at the buffet at the Terraces. It was a typical breakfast buffet, with scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, etc. Nothing special (e.g., no omelet bar), but it was OK. A couple of notes to remember: if you like to enjoy a beverage with your meal, order it before you visit the buffet; otherwise, it will arrive about the time you leave. Also, the nearest restrooms are located in the convention center (i.e., nowhere in the Terraces building), so plan accordingly. We checked out of our rooms (we had to go to the desk for this: for some reason, they couldn\u2019t just transfer the account information without seeing our by-now snarling faces), and we checked our bags with the bell desk. After spending the day out, we came back to check in to the new rooms. Not only did they need to see our faces, but they needed to see our ID\u2019s in order to do this, so we had to have one representative from each room turn up, with ID, at the desk. No idea why. The funny thing was, they enforced this ID thing with some of our rooms, but not all. They did have our keys all ready, and we trooped off to the new four rooms, which were located, respectively, here, over there, way over there, and way the hell over there. Thanks ever so much for the effort, Christina. The new rooms were, indeed, nicer. They were on the ground floor and were larger. However, each had a just one king-size bed, despite the assurances of both Javier-the-night-manager and Christina-the-morning-desk-person that we\u2019d have double queens. So as soon as we looked at the first room, we called the front desk to see what was up. This time, the story was different. The person on the line said that she had no idea why Javier and Christina had both promised double queen rooms; according to her, both Javier and Christina should have known, at the time they were making their promises, that no such rooms would be available to us. Now, if we wanted to move again the next day (call the Guinness Book of Records \u2013 three rooms in three days!), they could accommodate us. The bottom line was, we now had four rooms, each with a king bed in it, and, as the hotel had nothing more appropriate to offer us, we requested rollaways to be brought in ASAP. As it transpired, the term \u201cASAP\u201d didn\u2019t mean much to the staff \u2013 they brought them at such a leisurely pace that we left for dinner not knowing whether there would be adequate bedding when we got back that night. In fact, one granddaughter ended up in tears, as Grandma had to cancel a planned sleepover because she didn\u2019t know whether there would be another bed in her room. By then, I was really getting mad. I told the person on the phone that they should be looking at comping rooms at this point. She said they couldn\u2019t, as the reservations were made via Expedia \u2013 and that our requests for double queens were only requests, and did not have to be honored, since they, too, had been made via Expedia. My pointing out that two hotel employees, one of them a manager, had promised double queens, didn\u2019t make a dent. (Note to self: Self, in future, never book a hotel via Expedia; maybe use it to search, but book via the hotel directly.) The new rooms were pretty, but noisy. Each had a nice big bay window, which, I think, was the reason why anyone walking by, conversing in normal tones, sounded like they were right in our room, conversing via megaphones. Also, the shower head was mounted so low that, even though I\u2019m only 5\u20195\u201d, I had to kneel to wash my hair. (And no, it wasn\u2019t like that in order to accommodate folks with disabilities \u2013 if that were the reason, there would have been handrails. It was just mounted at a stupid height.) Now, to be fair, I must say that they did supply some of those little extras that really make a trip memorable. For instance, one of our four rooms came complete with a dirty diaper; it was on top of the armoire, along with the rest of the trash left by the previous occupants. And another room had a little touch of the beach in it: sand all over the tub. Given that a rinse was all it took to clean out the sand, it was clear that the maids had not bothered to rinse the tub, let alone properly clean it, even between guests. Glad I opted for a shower. The bottom line here is that the Town & Country is woefully mismanaged, and staffed by folks who will look you in the eye, smile, and lie their guts out. The cleaning crew couldn\u2019t get a job mucking out a pig sty.

Right behind the hotel is part of the San Diego River, and a bridge over that river takes one to a posh shopping center (Fashion Valley). My room was a sweet little cottage room with cherry wood colonial style furniture and a dark blue carpet. There was a huge four-poster bed, nice little writing desk, and a table by the bay window with two lovely big chairs. It opened directly out into a little courtyard with palm trees, a gazebo, lawn and rosebushes. It was a beautiful room, and a lovely, peaceful place to stay. I enjoyed walking around the grounds at night and in the morning--it was very well maintained. Weird stuff: Two of the more casual restaurants were shut when I was staying there, and the one that was open was too fancy for a person in casual clothes so I had to order (pricey) room service instead.

Example: I had to leave the Check-in area and drive all the way around to the otherside where the Tower is. The girl at the desk rushed to drag a pen across the map to tell me where my room was and how to get there. What she didn't tell me was that I didn't have to use the Road in front of the Convention Center (Which I wasn't aware that was part of the Hotel) but instead, I could turn right up what looks like a brick walkway but is actually a road that takes you up and through right past the curbside of the convention center to the back parking area (Which also isn't clearly marked as Town and Country but says Convention Center). I had to drive back to the front and ask one of the Valets there for better directions and he helped me 100 times better than the \"In-a-hurry\" girl at the front desk. The place is a maze and needs a vast improvement in regards to markings and directions. OK..Parking..$6.00 per day..Why? Should be included but not.

Also, the jacuzzi was under construction at the time of our stay, so we could not use it - but we were never told of this fact when we made our reservation or when we checked in. However - the biggest problem was when we checked out. Several hours after leaving the hotel I realized that I had left 2 jackets in the closet and my cell phone charger plugged in by the table. I called the hotel immediately and was told to speak with Janet in the Lost and Found department. Nothing was turned in that day and Janet said she would call me back with an update. Needless to say, several weeks later, no call back from Janet, so I called the hotel and asked to speak with a manager. After a run-around on the phone speaking with people who really just didn't seem to care, I got through to Mr. Sobek's office, the General Manager, and left him a message. He did follow up on my message by having one of his security officers call me back. My things were never found and when I pushed the issue the security officer offered to write up a report. Since I never heard back from Mr. Sobek directly I called him again and was able to speak with him in person. He did say that they had checked the lock records and according to that , no one but the 'room attendant' had entered my room that day. Basically he said they had done all that they could do and sorry that they never called me back and sorry that they don't know what happened to my things but that was really all they could do. No urgency, no offer to follow up on the matter, no real caring about the situation. When I pushed the issue Mr. Sobek stated that they often are accused of their staff stealing things from the rooms. At no time did I accuse anyone of stealing anything. My issue is that the hotel staff did not appear to take this matter seriously and that is what truly concerns me. Before this incident I had decided that I would never stay at this property again - mostly due to personal taste - but this issue is more serious and I warn travelers to be careful! To add insult to injury, during my phone call with Mr. Sobek, he basically hung up on me once he said 'goodbye', I didn't even have a chance to say 'goodbye' myself. I do find it interesting that the security officer offered to write up a report for me but Mr. Sobek didn't. Does he not know of the procedures in his own hotel? I don't doubt for a second that hotel management is a tough job, but customer service is the name of the game and this hotel should acknowledge that!", "Date": "November 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Hollywood CA", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful and Comfortable\u201d", "Author": "WestHollywood24", "ReviewID": "UR11075003", "Content": "The Town & Country offers a choice of high-rise and low-rise.

My tower, the Regency Tower, was quite pleasant. - comfortable bed, quiet, very good condition. Someone in the Royal Palm Tower spoke of a room which resemble earlier posts about carpet segments not matching, and rooms that weren't quite wonderful. The other buildings are two-level Best-Western-type door and window out onto the walkway along the outside of the building. Freeway noise would be a problem if you were near the front of the resort. No report on those. I had a few maintenance and housekeeping issues that I reported, and they were promptly fixed. The property was very nice, with several pool areas in good condition, and roses in bloom everywhere. It is a real drag that you have to pay for parking ($12/day) anywhere in the resort and there's really no place else to leave a car. Food prices are somewhat high in Terraces, the family restaurant, and higher still in the upper scale restaurant (Trellises). Many of the food things we had (especially the snacks for the conference) were excellent. There is an enormous up-scale shopping mall a moderate walk across the tracks behind the resort - many pleasant & reasonable dining options. I found the staff to be helpful and pleasant.

If all you need is a bed, take a look.\u201d", "Author": "YetAnotherTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR5981519", "Content": "This resort caters to conferences and conventions. It also tries to position itself as a place that is convenient for families. The old tagline is to pick one thing and do it well... T&C should heed that advice. After reading other TripAdvisor postings, I can see how there are so many different feelings about the same property. I've broken my review into a few sections to help you consider the property: Check-in Check-in is hit or miss. I sailed right through with an early arrival (10:30am) and they were very helpful. A colleague arrived at 11:30am and had to wait four almost 5 hours... they kept saying a room would be ready on the hour... only to keep repeating that every hour until 4pm. Bumped? The hotel has around 1,000 rooms. Apparently they often overbook, and I knew several people who got bumped to the Red Lion down the street because they didn't have any rooms upon arrival. Pick a theme The property is an interesting mix - part palm jungle, part rose garden and lots of concrete. There are little areas around the property to sit down, but they seemed to be inexpensive benches that weren't very sturdy. Kind of like whatever company had a closeout on benches at the time, they bought many and put them everywhere. Most seemed like they needed a cleaning and a new layer of paint. Suggested Rooms The property is kind of a wierd mix of styles - doubt this property ever had much of a master plan. There are small (1-3 story) units that are wood structures with cedar shake roofs. Then there is a Regency Tower that is about 8-9 stories, and a Royal Palm Tower that is about 12-14 stories tall. I was given a room in a two story unit - not bad size, though the pick a property theme continued - lots of 1970's wall paper with dark blue carpet and colonial style furniture. My room had seen better days - although it was a good size, it was pretty musty smelling. Some colleagues were assigned rooms in the Regency Tower, and mentioned it too had a lot to be desired. I heard best comments about the Royal Palm Tower, though a colleague mentioned his room was quite small and even had a Murphy bed. Yep, that was the only bed in the room. Wierd. Restaurants Ate mostly at the Terrace Cafe. Breakfast buffet for around $13, though seemed pretty tame - nothing special and seemed like it used the 99 cent sausages and frozen hash brown potatoes. It is open to midnight, so not a bad place if you need a sandwich later in the evening. Adjacent is the Sunshine Deli - home of pre-made sandwiches and salads for $8-12. Adjacent Food Right behind the property is the Trolley Station and the Fashion Valley Mall. Fashion Valley is an open air mall, and has a good mix of retail (JCPenney to Saks, Macy's to Nordstrom) and a nice food court (Rubio's Mexican, Chinese, Hamburgers, etc). It also had a Pizzeria Uno restaurant, and a PF Chang's and Cheesecake Factory just north of the mall (on the mall property but just beyond the main central walkway to the north near the parking areas). There are lots of maps so you can find your way around the FV Mall. If you have time, take a walk (easy pathways, sidewalks & crosswalks) to the mall for better menu selection and prices. Taxi's My fare was about $23 to the property. Apparently the pathway from the airport to I-5 is a wierd route, and many people thought their cab driver was running up the fare using side streets to get to I-5. I later learned this is the main route, so don't fear if it seems like it's a strange way. The hotel often has shuttles stopping by for return trips to the airport - $10-15 one way. Shuttles - good news is that there aren't many hotels between here and the airport for them to stop at, so most of the time I understand it's a direct run to the airport from the hotel (as in my case). Spa/Workout Took a tour - seemed nice, though it's around $8 a day if you want to use the workout room. Quite small for a 1000 room property, so when a convention is on site, it is often packed full with wait times for each piece of equipment. General Facilities Seemed like a time warp in some areas - some of the restrooms in the convention area were modern and nice, others were tiny and worn. I understand the convention facilities were the only ones in the area in - you guessed it - the 1960's, so be ready to go back in time. While ok from a distance, when you get close or look with a purpose, you see dirty ceilings, funky light fixtures and what appears to be lots of cosmetic work to dress up a very tired facility. In some places it works ok, in others it seems as effective as putting lipstick on a pig. Be careful around the convention area - the load in area for the exhibit hall is right in the path to the facility for convention participants. A few times the forklifts almost took me out with their long forks and somewhat inattentive drivers. Check-out After a convention, it's chaotic in the lobby. Check-out time is 11am, so if you have a later flight, you can hold your luggage at the bell station. *NOTE* If you have a laptop, they WILL NOT take the laptop with the rest of the bags. I asked if I could sign something that would waive any damage - no way. I was stuck - until I asked at the front desk and learned they had a few (2-3) larger safe boxes. If they are available, you can put your laptop in there for safekeeping (I had to find that out on my own - would have been nice if the bell station would have offered this option). Otherwise, you are out of luck and hauling that around. Bottom Line If you get assigned here for a conference, aim for the Royal Palm Tower if a more modern room (for this property) is important. If you want quiet and can stand a musty smell, aim for a smaller unit on the property and keep the fan or a/c running to move the air around. If you get a good price and need a convenient location for San Diego attractions and all you need is a bed, this could work - though I'd really check out other properties in the same price range.", "Date": "October 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, AZ", "Title": "\u201cRun for the hills!

It has got to be one of THE worst \"hotels\" I have ever had the displeasure of staying. Out of no choice of my own, our school district booked it for a conference that I was attending in July. (The conference hall, which is part of the Town and Country, is a step up from the rest of the hotel). I'll begin with the total disorganization in the lobby during check-in... Granted, there were a zillion teachers and other guests swarmed in the lobby, but one would think that by now management would have implemented some sort of organized procedure for handling guests at such high volumes. No one seemed to know what was going on and the times we were told our rooms would be ready varied from one staff person to another. As we trekked through the overgrown jungle-like walkways to get to a restaurant for breakfast, we landed upon a low-class version of a cafe. It looked like some sort of side of the highway Jerry's Restaurant from the 1960s. After standing in a line that went out the door, we were seated at separate tables (not a big deal, since there were 9 of us). However, after waiting forever I was hoping for a meal that was at least somewhat palatable. I'm not sure how you go wrong with a cheese omlet and potatoes, but they managed to. The potatoes were charred and the omlet was grey - everything tasted like a piece of charcoal! Yuck!! After two bites, I paid my twelve dollars and easily convinced the rest of our group never to dine here again. I've never paid so much for such a disgusting meal. Several hours later we had a room. With all of the money that they get from ripping people off, I don't see how they can't afford to update the place. The rooms were dark, dirty, old, and just plain old creepy. They have this bizarre old Victorian thing going on as their decor. The bathrooms have peeling wall paper and the shower doesn't seem to have been scrubbed since they built the hotel. There were special hairs in my bed and on a few \"clean\" towels. Yes, the special kind that you keep down under. The toilet backed up even after having someone come in and \"fix\" it. The walls are paper thin. We could hear our neighbors brushing their teeth and unfortunately for us, we got to smell their cigarette smoke all night and morning while in the room. Haven't they heard of separating smoking floors from non-smoking floors??? I've read several reviews about the beautiful grounds and pools. Not true... Unless you consider gardens littered in trash and worn down pools littered with seedy characters everywhere beautiful. This \"hotel\" couldn't have gotten things more wrong. They need to shut down and renovate every inch of this property. Perhaps back in the 1950s or 60s this place was of resort quality, but it has since been flushed to sewer quality.

I chose a room in the Royal Palm Tower because most of the negative reviews on Trip Advisor seemed to be about rooms in other parts of the hotel. We stayed at this hotel several years ago so I was prepared this time for the dark, dated rooms. (The walls & carpets are a fairly dark shade of blue.) I'm not sure if the bathroom had been updated but it was bright & cheery. There was a sink in the actual bathroom area & an additional vanity/sink right outside the bathroom - it was handy having 2 sinks. Our room was large & our air conditioning worked fine . All the rooms in the Royal Palm Towers have balconies - most look out at the resort but a few just look at concrete walls. We were on the 2nd floor & enjoyed our balcony a lot because it was shaded by the ground level trees. Parking is definitely a problem but because we never got back in the late evening, we could always find a decent parking space. We ate breakfast & a couple of dinners in the attractive Terrace Cafe - food is ok. The nearby mall (walking distance) has a food court and several popular chain restaurants: California Pizza Kitchen, P.F. Chang's, The Cheesecake Factory & Uno Chicago Grill. It is very convenient to take the Trolley to downtown - we took it to Petco Park.

The front clerk said he would give them someone else's room that had not checked in. He gave them a two queen bed room. Then my husband goes to check in and they have no rooms. I had to argue with them for over 30 minutes and wouldn't you know it...they found us a room. However, the front clerk referred to the people who had reserved that room as \"poor bastards.\" Very Distasteful. This is how they see their customers. They told me that even though I held the conformation in my hand for a two queen bed room (I had already paid as well) they could not guarantee me a room or the specified accomodations. It is a first come first serve faciltiy. And I could not get reimbursed for the money I paid should I be put in a cheaper room. The front clerks did not know how to run the computer and they were very rude. They almost put us in a room that was already occupied!!!! I could not believe it. TOP THAT OFF with $12.00 a day parking fees that is not posted anywhere. We stayed three nights and paid $390.00 for the room and parking. There was no microwave or refrigerator. Parking was awful and overcrowded. All the employees were rude and seemed to HATE their job and the people who chose to stay there. I would never recommend this place to anyone.

Roses that are beautiful, multi-colored and \"Humongous\". My wife and I live in Ewa Beach and just returned from a four night stay at the Town and Country during the month of June. I've read many reviews about this hotel, many good, many bad, which made us a little skeptical. However, we thought, (1) the Town and Country had an excellent location to the areas we wanted to see, (2) we had never stayed at this hotel prior to this visit, and (3) everyone has different opinions about different thngs, so, why not, \"Chance Um\". We checked in on a Wednesday night after ten-thirty and was greeted by Brian, a courteous and very friendly gentleman. Brian informed us from the Get-Go that there would be a $12.00 a day parking fee, I guess other guests had complained about this surprise expense, but remember, I've read all of the prior traveler reviews, so I was \"ready\". After locating our building, you could tell that it looked like any other fifty-three year old hotel, showing signs of maturity, but still maintaining that graceful look. All of the parking stalls were taken. Vehicles were also parked out of stalls and anywhere you could squeeze a vehicle into, with no assigned parking stalls, the parking lot theme was \"Park Where-Ever\". Another \"Challenge\" to staying at this hotel, but we found our special parking space right next to our room, \"Be Creative\". We stayed on the second floor of a two story building in Room #3381. No elevators, so we had to hump our luggage up the stairs and carry our sleeping six year old grandson. The room was \"quaint\" with nothing to brag about. However, the room looked \"Beautiful\" especially after a long flight from Honolulu and a hassel with Dollar Rent a Car, but that's another story. Finding a place to eat dinner after eleven is another challenge. The parking lot attendant was courteous and informative. He suggested Denny's which we happily agreed to, hot cakes, over-easy eggs and link sausage never tasted so good. The next day, we toured the hotel grounds. Beautiful surroundings, day or night. Prices at the hotel are what you would expect at any other place, \"High, Higher, and Highest\". However, we had the use of a Dodge Charger, and there are a plethora of choices surrounding the Town and Country. There is even a Trolley, a short walk behind of the hotel, just before you reach the Fashion Valley Shopping Center, which can take you to Old town or Downtown for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Sleeping at night can be a problem if you are a light sleeper. On several occasions, I could hear people talking or walking \"heavily\" by our room. Adjacent \"Neighbors\" can be heard talking due to thin walls. Air Conditioning. If you like to have an instant cold air conditioning, this place is not for you. However, the room does get cold, but it slowly creeps up on you. So as you leave for your daily itinerary, leave the air conditioner on \"High\", and you will be rewarded upon your return to your room. Housekeeping was excellent. After informing the maid that there were three people staying in the room and not two people, we were never lacking in towels or amenities. Upon returning, our room was always squared away and since we stayed out to almost midnight every night, we were never bothered by the maid as long as you place the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign in your electronic key slot. There were always hotel security roaming the grounds, especially at night, and this fact alone is the reason why I would choose Town and Country, again and again.

Great for the renovations not so great for parking! Our room was nice and spacious but the decor again has got to be updated carpet and all - whew! Not sure what design theme was colonial ? something don't know? Felt like we stepped back into the 60-70s. The bathroom shutter door (which limits privacy) stuck to the floor. The bathroom is very spacious. The wallpaper has to go. There was mold and water buildup around the showers and the sink was multiple cracked. They had a really nice linen closet for extra linen/towels etc. The bed was wonderful great pillows. Sleeping was good! They have multiple pools on the property which ducks enjoy too! Our room was centrally located to restaurant/cafes and near the convention center. Not good when it rained though. The restaurant was really good. Breakfast was excellent! Service was excellent! Dinner/late night eating had unlimited options for late dining but very limited service and wasn't sure we'd get our food but once we did it was good. We ate only at the Terrace Cafe. They have multiple levels of eateries sitdown table cloth, family cafe, deli to go. Which was really nice. Had room service one morning only - it was horrible. Everything was cold!

We were about to unpack when I noticed a sign on the door saying that this was a non-smoking room. I called the desk to say there was a problem and that this was a non-smoking room, they came back saying that was all they had and that maybe the next day they might have one (that would be night two of our two night stay). Be reminded that the gentleman at the front desk verified this is what we had asked for. To make a long story short, we decided we would find a room at another hotel that would definitely give us what we wanted (which we did. The Doubletree was new, beautiful, accomodating and less expensive). The kicker is when we went down to the desk to give the key back a lady was at the counter almost in tears. It seems she was attending a convention at the Convention Center at the hotel. She had arrived earlier that morning and they told her that her room wasn't ready and to come back later in the day. It was 5:30 p.m. and they had GIVEN HER ROOM AWAY!! She had made her reservation a month in advance, had her confirmation in hand, and all they could do was apologize, they had no rooms left!!

We had a lovely view of the pool and tropical vegetation if we kept the drapes open, although people could then look into the room. The bathroom wallpaper was pealing in places, but not bad. The room was clean, and well-supplied with towels, etc. The handle on the bathroom sink kept coming unscrewed. The room clock/radio periodically made loud humming noises, so we finally unplugged it. The mattresses were VERY firm, too firm for me. The walls were somewhat thin, as we could hear the doors slamming closed next door, the service personnel rolling their carts back and forth over the cobbled walkway outside, and people talking as they walked by. After the first night we turned the room AC fan up on full to help drown out the noises. There is a charge for all calls outside the resort, including 1-800 calling cards and local calls, and you have to pay by the day to use the exercise facilities. We got parking included with the conference fees, but other people staying there had to pay. There were billing problems for many of the folks from our group, which still weren't resolved when we left. A PO had been issued by our employer to cover room costs, but the front desk hotel personnel (usually \"interns\") insisted upon billing someone for each room. Some of our group got angry and refused to give them a credit card #. One supervisor was told her credit card would be billed for the total cost of the group. Two of my coworkers said they had problems with their rooms, and called for maintanence, who promised to be right there and never showed up. The food at the restaurants onsite was overpriced, so most of us went to the mall next door to eat, or drove to other San Diego locations. The tram system is right behind the resort, and very handy to travel about town. It even goes all the way to Tijuana. I wouldn't stay at the T & C again, especially at the rates our employer was charged. The best things about the T & C are the grounds (lovely tropical flowers, vines and roses everywhere with gazebos, trellises, benches, and the pools), and the location next to the trolley system and mall. It's worth walking through to see the resort grounds, but stay somewhere else if you have the choice, unless you get a super deal.", "Date": "August 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cDumpy\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3728910", "Content": "We stayed here for a conference in late July.

The hotel has beautiful grounds, however, the rooms are in bad need of a remodel. The conference rooms were large, but are also in need of a remodel. The hotel is very close to the freeway and downtown San Diego. This whole area needs an update however.

We decided to rent a movie off of the service that is provided in the room which was a great movie but did not expect to pay $11.00 for it and the $2.00 movie tax they charge on top of that.

We got a triple room in the Royal Palm Towers (I think) for $159/nt. It was in the building at the back of the resort. The room was on the bottom floor, had a beautiful outdoor patio accessible via sliding glass door from the room. Room was quite spacious with 2 queen beds, very clean, and beds were turned down in the evening with chocolates left on the pillows! We ordered pizza from room service and it was delicious and reasonably priced for a hotel room service. Staff was helpful, friendly and courteous. As stated in other reviews, the grounds on this resort are beautifully landscaped. There are 4 pools, and only one seemed to have mainly kids at it. Even for a busy weekend, adults could find a relatively quiet pool to relax at. Sea World is very easily accessed via a short freeway drive, and the trolly stop behind the hotel is great to get around San Diego. My daughter loved having the mall right behind the hotel as well. As some other reviews stated, the hotel does seem to cater to large groups and conventions, and several were present during the weekend of our stay as well. However, I did not find the hotel service to me or my family compromised due to this. The coffee shop had good food for breakfast/lunch, but didn't try any other hotel restaurants. There were periods of times of loud partying, etc, that could be heard either from your room or various parts of the property, however, by the time I was ready to hit the pillow (btw, the pillows were not very comfortable, the only negative of this place I can really state) and turn out the lights, it was a quiet night well into 8 or 9 am the next morning. My husband and daughter used the Spa for massages, facial and manicure and pedicure, and they had a wonderful experience there as well!! As stated before, this is not the Ritz, but in my experience for the price and location it is an excellent value. From reading the negative reviews on here I think perhaps your experience may depend on which room you get and where. I'd highly recommend a ground floor room in the tower at the rear of the property.

Since the trolly station is directly across the street behind the property, you can leave the car parked and access many of the great sights and attractions of San Diego (we were in town to watch baseball at Petco Park). If you prefer sitting by the pool and relaxing with a good book, you are surrounded by the beautiful gardens and landscape.
