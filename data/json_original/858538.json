This one was very nice, newer, and the location is very close to a lot of restaurants and shopping, while still being convenient to the highway. I was impressed to find out they have an airport shuttle as it is a ways from the airport. Couldn't quite give it an excellent as the lighting in the bathroom is really inadequate for applying makeup. Pretty sconces but more form than function, and a bit of mold along the bathtub. But I'll definitely stay here again.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "N/A", "Title": "\u201cHotel it self was nice, but the staff was horrible.\u201d", "Author": "Deedy D", "ReviewID": "UR116874590", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel during the summer and the hotel is really nice, but the staff was horrible.

I will never ever stay at this hotel again. The way they talked to the black people in there was just down right wrong, I am not black and I felt really bad for the way they talked to them. I will never ever stay there again and I will tell all of my friends to avoid this hotel whenever they are in Memphis.

Upon our arrival, we were given dirty rooms and rooms that were occupied by other guests. After several rooming assignments we finally received a room ready for check in. My room keys were deactivated twice within the 1st day. On the 2nd day, we had to check out at the request of \"Cerrato\" who phoned the cops on our group without cause. He is a very disrespectful person and should not be working with anyone in the public. It has been brought to my attention that this type of treatment happens almost always to african americans. I am pleading with the ownership to take a look into the unnecessary treatment at the hands of your employees (Cerrato & Higginbotham) or your business will be facing voluminous legal actions. Cerrato & Higginbotham don't have a clue as to who they were talking with or even what they've done... just know that what you've done to us has already been done to you.

It was in great condition inside and out. I checked in with the Night Auditor who has master the balance between friendly and professional.

Both beautiful and unique in its design, thanks to housekeeping it was also spotless. (And I am a tough inspector.) There was only one issue I saw while I was there: it is very difficult to get the shower curtain pulled close enough to the edge of the shower to prevent water from running out onto the bathroom floor. The breakfast in the morning was good and kept fresh. A girls\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 soccer team had just left the area, so the breakfast person was very busy trying to restock everything. She still managed to work in a smile and a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Good Morning\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when she passed me. Checkout was a breeze and Tekela, the desk clerk, was very nice.
