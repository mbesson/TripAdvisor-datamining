It is linked to the thermostat. I cant just turn on the fan for white noise. With I-65 a few hundred feet away, this is a BIG problem. I'm not even on the wing closest to the freeway! There's freeway noise, there's a guy grunting in the next room, and the blackout shades dont cover the windows around the edges at all. I could look the other way but there is a smoke detector or something that is a very bright light flashing every FOUR seconds. Is that really necessary? They should flash once a minute or something.

Chose this hotel for the park and fly benefit and had to end up catching a cab back to hotel at 1130pm on Sat night. We were given written instructions to wait at zone 2 after calling hotel for pick up. Waited approx 30 min no van. Called again, was told by desk clerk van was on it's way and to wait at zone 2, and our name had been given to the driver. 15 min later van arrived at zone 1 as far away from zone 2 as possible, by the time we took our luggage down to zone 1, the van was filled (van only holds 7 people) was told by driver that a gold car was available to take more passengers and 4 people hopped into this car and left. The gold car had no Comfort Suite logo on it, for all we knew it was somebody's own personal vehicle from the hotel. After waiting a total of 45 min. took a cab for a 10 min ride back to hotel which costs 23.00. So to sum it up, 1 van for 7 people during 45 min period and the hotel is only 10 min away. Upon arrival at hotel, asked to speak to manager and was told the manager was the shuttle driver and couldn't be reached. Hmm. Asked for managers name and the desk clerk stated he just knew his first name, gave me a card with a name on it. Informed desk clerk that we would like to speak to manager about this matter and was told that he would contact us in the morning At the same time a couple was being told that there confirmed reservation was invalid because the hotel was booked. They too were asking to speak to the manager and were getting the run around, \"unable to contact him\" was what they were told. Next morning at check out, man in lobby vacuuming, no one at desk, rang bell for service, woman appeared and we asked if the manager was available. She immediately looked down at the floor and then to man and asks \"may I help you,\" again, \"is the manger in, that's a yes or no question.\" The woman looked over at the man vacuuming and we approached the man and evidently, he was the manager. We informed him about the transportation issue and how we were told we would be contacted the following morning. He didn't appear to be the least bit interested and acted like that was the norm at this hotel. Asked him about the couple without a room and he said he \"didn\"t know anything about it.\" All we wanted was reimbursement for the cab and an apology for poor transportation service.

My wife and I checked into our room late on a Saturday night. After crawling into the bed, we noticed something ticking us. I turned the lights on and noticed numerous hairs on the sheet. Since it was late, we decided to remove the sheet and sleep on top of the bedspread. In the morning, I decided to inspect the sheet. At this time, I discovered what appeared to be fecal matter on the sheet we had removed. We immediately left the room and I notified the person working the desk that morning. He was rude and was obviously not able to assist us. I decided to wait and contact management during normal business hours. I sent an email detailing our experience and only asking for a refund of the reward points we had used for this stay. A few days later, I received an email from one of the property managers. She was very condescending and stated if we had notified the desk that night, they would have addressed it. If I had noticed the fecal matter that night, we would have simply left. She further stated she would not be refunding our points but would hope I would stay there again in the future. I contacted Choice Hotels directly and the gentleman agreed that this was a completely unacceptable response. He refunded my points and assured me that this incident would be notated. I stay in over 100 Choice Properties a year and have never filed a complaint. Not only was the condition of the room deplorable, the responses from the management of this hotel made a bad situation terrible.

Newer hotel, so a modern, updated appearance and amenities. Very comfortable beds with comfortable sheets, blankets, and comforters. Cons: Breakfast offered is apple juice and orange juice, three different kinds of cereal (Fruit Loops, Rice Krispies, and Frosted Flakes), fruit, mini muffins and assorted small pastries and bagels, and biscuits and gravy. The breakfast area is not kept stocked as people come in to eat, so if you arrive later in the morning (breakfast is served from 6:30 - 9:30) you are out of luck. I would say the breakfast would remind me of options you would have at a QuikTrip and was not sufficient to satisfy the appetites of myself, my husband, or our young children. If you are in a bind and need something more than a snack to eat, you are out of luck at this hotel. Very bad location. It is difficult to get to and is not near any restaurants or shopping areas. If you want some decent food or to be able to pick up some items, you will have to drive for a bit. No view. Not a huge deal for us, but, if it is of any matter to you, there is no view. So, to sum it up, I would say it would be an excellent hotel for a busy single traveler who has to eat on the go as it is a very nice hotel and is very near the airport.

I must say this hotel is the nicest Comfort Inn/Suites I have seen. Our family spent the night at this hotel and took advantage of their \"Stay and Fly\" package.

The bedding was high quality and the mattresses were very comfortable. The room was extremely well appointed, and I can honestly say our room was nicer than some rooms we have had at hotels costing much, much more per night. The front desk employees were extremely friendly and courteous. Unfortunately, we had an early flight and we did not get to partake of the free breakfast, so I cannot comment on its quality. If I had to criticize the hotel in any way, I would say they need more parking. They offer a nice \"Stay and Fly\" package and they seem to have a lot of people taking advantage of it (including our family). Several guests had to park in non parking spaces the night we stayed. I don't know if that happens regularly but I was glad we didn't arrive at the hotel later in the evening or there may have been no room to take advantage of the \"Stay and Fly\" feature.
