I was very disappointed to find out that there were no vacancies available for the four days I was going to be in Paris. They did say that they had a very small room for one person but that they did not post information about those rooms on the website. I went ahead and reserved the room and afterwards several friends who were familiar with Paris told me that it was a bad idea, that the rooms would be minute, and I wouldn't be happy.I wasn't able to find anything else in the St. Germaine area that interested me so I went ahead and kept the reservation. I was very surprised to find that I liked the room. It was tiny but also was charming and comfortable. Since this was my first time in Paris the central location, within walking distance of the Luxembourg Gardens, the Sienne and Notre Dame, was perfect. It happened to be unseasonably warm in Paris the week I was there and I will say that it did get noisy with an open window at night but usually calmed down about 11 pm or so. The staff was helpful,and arranged for my very early Saturday morning trip to the airport.

Our two year old slept quite soundly in the very small bedroom (it had it's own door) and we were able to enjoy a glass of wine in the evening with the windows wide open. The room itself was interesting, when you walked in it was a tiny hallway with two very small bedrooms off of it. Our room (the larger one) was a decent size.

The location is amazing: one block from Blvd Saint Germain and Rue de Buci, and less than 500 meter from Jardin du Luxembourg. Not to mention 2 very near subway stations from different lines to choose from.

I had booked a \"courtyard\" room, which was supposedly much quieter than the streetside rooms. Unfortunately, the \"courtyard\" was really an airshaft between two buildings, and the city of Paris had decided to do construction on the adjacent street which necessitated completely blocking in the courtyard.. All the windows on the \"courtyard\" were covered with scaffolding, (we tried three of the six floors), which meant zero light, zero air flow and lots of noises during working hours. We figured it was probably a fire hazard as well, since there was no access to the outside from the room. It was totally eerie to stay in a room with absolutely no natural light, and we had to request that the air conditioning in our room be left on constantly to give us some air. (The air conditioning is controlled by the front desk, individually for each room.) Fortunately, we spent most of our day sightseeing, so the noise (giant hunks of flying cement crashing against the building) during working hours wasn't as much of a problem for us as it was for many others staying in the hotel. Everyone was complaining, and the only compensation offered was a ten percent discount for the inconvenience. One family with a baby was practically in tears, since they were planning on nap times, which were an obvious impossibility. The desk staff suggested they take the baby to the park to nap. Beyond this (major) problem with the room, we loved the location, the lobby was very nice, and the room, although not huge, was what we've come to expect in Paris at this price.. Rooms over the street would be fine during the day, but quite noisy at night, since the hotel is directly across from a large outdoor wine bar with people partying till late at night.", "Date": "June 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nailsworth, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201ctop location\u201d", "Author": "CheltenhamGeorge", "ReviewID": "UR14492725", "Content": "Fantastic Location in St Germain des Pres - 2 minutes from Metro.

This happened every night as the cleaners turned it on during the day so it was roasting when we came back! Also, the noise from the corridors was very load. There were people staying around our room who were talking to each other on the corridors and they may as well have been standing in our room. The cleaners would also start vacuuming outside our room at about 9 so there was no chance of a lie in.
