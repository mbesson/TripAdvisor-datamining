He was friendly and also called other area hotels, they were full as well, I had no option but stay in the smoking room. When I complained more he told me that he would give me a reduced rate ($99), the rate is not why I booked this property, the way we were treated in the past was. I told him if I had not shown up even though they sold my room, I would have still been charged the original rate, and that was the room I wanted. From the hall, the tag on the door said it was a non-smoking room, my wife stated, maybe he made a mistake and it is a non-smoking room, as soon as I inserted the key card and opened the door it was very obvious it was a smoking room as the smell blasted into the hall. We entered into the room and started to sit down and the chair in the room but it was severely stained, looked like someone had pee'd or pooped on it. There were cigarette burns on the sink in the bathroom and overall the entire room smelled terrible. My wife and I were flying home the next day and neither of us got more than 1 - 2 hours of sleep because every time one of us would move, the stink of cigarette smoke would come from the covers moving. The next morning when we checked out I stopped at the front desk, the lady there said she was the one that had assigned rooms each day and that she specifically remembers assigning a non-smoking room to us. She asked what could be done to fix the situation and I told her (while pointing to the Hampton guarantee) that I should not have to pay for a room I reserved and paid for in advance and then received the exact opposite of what was purchased. She told me that it was too early in the morning, the manager was not there and she would discuss it with him and if he approved, she would waive the charge. I provided my cell phone number and asked to be called when the manager was there. 3 hours later, just prior to boarding our flight I called back, spoke with the same lady and was told, the manager did approve waiving the cost, but I never received a call from the manager. While glad I did not have to pay for that deplorable room, I am shocked that I did not hear from the management staff. I also feel it was criminal that a room that I had reserved and secured with a credit card could be sold to another guest. I am also amazed Hilton still has smoking rooms, what a disgusting place to expect people to work (housekeepers and guests) and stay, I understand providing an area for smoking, but in rooms is obsolete. It is no wonder that it was the last place available. While in the military I was deployed multiple times, I can think of at least three locations that I would rather stay at than this property if this is the level of service and type of room they will provide. If I had to book a room tomorrow in the same part of the city, I definitely would not return here at this time, if this is how I can expect to be treated. If you do not mind possible staying in a stinking room, taking a chance your reservation will not be honored and then as another person posted, having to prove what you reserved, this might be the place for you.

Best of all, this area had a large mirror with good lighting, which enabled two of us to get ready at the same time. Our room, which was at the back of the hotel, was so quiet that we accidentally left the window open all night and slept very well. We actually forgot that we left the window open. The only nit-picky negatives I can think of are that the breakfast area was small (we had to take our food back to the room) and that the hotel used scented cleaning products and room spray.

I used to stay at the Courtyard (formerly a Radisson) over on Ventura Blvd., but they started raising their rates so I was happy when they built this Hampton Inn. I've stayed here twice now and both experiences were so-so. Upon check-in this time, I was told I had a double with queen beds. I informed them I'd reserved a king bed. It took me digging through my luggage to produce a printed copy of the confirmation email before he finally believed that I had a king reserved. Then, it took him another 15 minutes to put me in a room... during which time, I watched him put 2 phone calls on permanent \"hold\" and then finally just quit answering the ringing phone. So, overall, my impression of the service level and staff competency wasn't good. The most inconvenient thing here -- and the reason I probably won't stay here again -- is the parking lot. Clearly, it doesn't have enough spaces for a full hotel and many of the spaces it does have are narrow and inaccessible. Once you have your car in a space, you're reluctant to leave even to go get dinner for fear that you'll come back and the lot will be full. The neighborhood's sketchy, too, so the prospect of having to park somewhere nearby wasn't appealing, either. Finally, even though this hotel isn't many years old, they're renovating the lobby area. So, they're serving breakfast in a limited space and there wasn't any seating available. The only option was to grab something and take it back to your room to eat. I'll probably head back to the Courtyard on the next trip... or look for something else.", "Date": "October 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cOK Hotel, bad parking situation\u201d", "Author": "pianoman822", "ReviewID": "UR119597258", "Content": "We usually stay at Hampton Inns, and in fact had just stayed at one the week before in Las Vegas.

The problem that that property has is that they do NOT have enough parking for their facility. That is, they do not have enough spaces to accommodate their guests. They know about the situation, and try to help, including letting people park in every available area whether it is designed for parking or not, but still if you get in later in the evening, you could have to find street parking. It is not a good situation. Another small thing... and this admittedly IS small: But each evening when we came in, they were out of warm cookies. We jokingly asked about it, and they said, each night, that they ran out. Now, and again this is small, but it seems the idea of having warm cookies for guests is a wonderful, welcome to the hotel idea, and to say that they are out, and only make a certain amount, seems cheap, and leaves you with the opposite feeling, like you are not a welcome guest that they want to accommodate, but a nuisance that needs to be put up with.

Hampton Inn Sherman Oaks has a professional staff that can and will help you with daytrips, tours and also their own personal suggestions to how to spend your day. We were told of specific sites were we were able to get closer to the famous Hollywood sign instead of 'just' watching it from the Kodak Theatre area..a suggestion that lived up to our suggestions. Furtheremore we were bumped up to a suite for free, instead of a normal room with two queen size beds. The suite also had a small balcony with a if not super view of the city, then a view of the mountains in the morning - very nice. But: The parking ( which, very importantly in LA, were for free ) on the other hand was not very large, and this is not that good if you arrive e.g. late in the evening We came in late one night and the only parking spot left, was right next to the entrance (see picture) , allmost in the reception area. But at least we got a parkingspace, but other guests arriving later than we did, were forced to find parking other (unsurveilled ) places than us.

We got there at about 1pm and we were told that the room wasn't ready and they would be ready in an hour. We walked around and ate lunch, came back to find out that they still weren't ready. Walked around again, came back....STILL wasn't ready....at this point it was almost 3pm! Once we got our room, we realized that they gave us a non-smoking room when we reserved a smoking room. Another fail.....the staff was nice, but they didn't accomodate any of our requests.... Others - The elevator is SUPER SLOOOOOOW. They had a business center and we went down to use it so we can print some documents out, but their internet wasn't working..... If you don't have any special requests, this hotel would work for you. Otherwise....be aware that your requests may not be fulfilled. I just don't think $155.00 for a room was reasonable with all the hassles we had to deal with.", "Date": "June 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cA modern and large suite\u201d", "Author": "Brian5900", "ReviewID": "UR67647559", "Content": "We reserved and paid 3 nights in advance and thus got a very good rate (~$127/day).
