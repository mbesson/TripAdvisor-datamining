Our fifth floor room was clean and featured a large bathroom, balcony, and view of the Grand Canal -- which was great. While I only saw two rooms in the hotel, they do seem in need of refurbishment.

It did cost me extra as apparently they don't upgrade to canal view rooms due to the demand for such rooms in Venice. The hotel really is quite beautiful and the lobby is quite exquisite. I was a little surprised at how much food and drink was at the hotel. I've stayed at similar pricey hotels and didn't find the food to be quite as expensive as it was at the Westin Regina. It is Europe though and I know you have to expect it. I was also a little taken aback that there was a charge for WIFI. I had stays in smaller hotels in Italy that had free WIFI so I guess when you pay as much as you do at such hotels like the Westin, you might expect WIFI to be complimentary.

When we approached the front desk lady with the issue, she answered that at this time of the year the AC is off at the whole hotel. So my parents had to open the windows all the time and let in mosquitos which didn't let them sleep normally. In our room tempreture was fine, so it depends on the room location I suppose. According to the law (we were said) hotels are not allowed to give irons to their guests, so the only option was to give clothes for ironing.

Within 15 minutes, you can pretty much walk as far as Cannaregio. Finding the hotel from the main street I must admit was a bit difficult, as you need to travel through a several small corridor looking streets to get to the front of the hotel. What is unique about Venice in general is that because there's no cars, it's absolute silence on the streets by about 10am (at least in the month of March). Opening our windows, all we could here were a bunch of alley cats. I must say that the buffet breakfast was the best of the 6 cities we stayed. Lots of variety and great selection of hot and cold items. Our favorite was the mango puree ! The seating area itself was fantastic. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The outdoor section is adjacent the Grand Canal. What a wonderful experience. The only suggestion I'd like to make for management is the cost of some of the items.

When we looked out the window we realized the building next door was also being renovated (the front desk said through June). We asked to be moved to the other side of the building - and they gladly moved us (we wondered why we had to ask for the switch...surely they had received other complaints).

Our room was supposedly a Platinum upgrade - I'm assuming because we were on the 6th floor with views of the surrounding roof tops. Comfortable beds, impeccable housekeeping, great heating system, plenty of hot water and good water pressure in the bath, in-room safe, flat screen TV, beautiful details like Murano glass light fixtures. The common areas of the hotel are truly beautiful - lots of marble and lux fabrics. Perfect location if you want to focus on St. Mark's and around - easy access to 1, 2 and many other vaporetto lines. Concierge was just as rude as my last stay - just unfortunate given the caliber of the hotel and the quality of other staff members. I would definitely stay here again if I could use points, but here are a few notes to consider: Location for Carnvevale is good and bad - you're right there for all the action in St. Mark's Square, but that also means braving huge crowds just to get back to the hotel (on the weekend, not nearly as bad on Fat Tuesday) and noise late into the night. We could hear the bands in our room, which may be OK some nights, but was particularly painful the night something called the Spleen Orchestra headlined. Tip for Fat Tuesday - the bar staff let us sit outside on the terrace even though it was closed so we were able to watch the gondola regatta as they passed Salute and then watched the bull light on fire looking down the Grand Canal towards St. Mark's. If I go for Carnevale again, I think I'll stay in a quieter part of the city and just go back and forth on the vaporetto. Bar is outrageously expensive - it is beautiful and all the bar staff we met were so nice, but at these prices you may as well go to Harry's Bar down the block. If you need a quick coffee or drink there is a little bar on Calle Larga XXII Marzo and a newshop that has an outdoor vending machine we used late nights on Calle delle Ostreghe. Do not disturb signs not respected - we had the mini-bar staff barge in on us dressing twice even though we had DND signs on the door.

The Westin Europa & Regina was simply outstanding. It will cost you (even if the rooms are reasonable -they were for me - everything else is very expensive, more than any other place I've traveled - London, Dublin, Paris, you name it...this was the most expensive.

It set me back 110 euro so plan accordingly (I believe they have a \"water bus\" that's considerably cheaper but takes 2 hours or so and will kill the romance if that's what your plan is with the bride/husband).

Hotel bar is stunning, a bit quiet on a January night, but nice to chill and have a beverage or two in. Fitness center well appointed. Everything is in walking distance. Get a map and get out on the streets. If you weren't in the infantry you are going to get lost so plan accordingly. If you were, it really isn't that difficult to figure out where you are at. My recommendation is avoid the $50 per person room service breakfast (cappucino, a glass of orange and one croissant) and take a walk. You will find great little places to spend 5 euro and have the equivalent meal. And you will love the walk. See everything, walk everywhere, eat too much, have pastries every other block. And a wine or six. Just get lost, find a museum, etc. It's a four-day sort of town.

Surprisingly, the staff was extremely friendly and attentive as at times we find this not always to be in Europe. We did make a trip to Lido, we asked the conceirge about getting a water taxi, but he said the hotel has reciprocity with a hotel over there and will take you for free. Its about a 20 minute ride over, however it is a short walk to town in lido once you get over there. On our final day, we had the water taxi pick us up at our hotel as we had an early morning flight back to the states. It is expensive for a water taxi ( about $140 one way), but it literally takes about 20 minutes early in the morning and illeviates any stress. You can pre book online with the water taxi company for about $90 each way. We will do this on our next visit to Venice. This hotel is great, the conceirge is okay for providing maps and general info. But really explore Venice, there are great restaurants off the beaten path.

As platinum guests, we were lucky enough to have a chance to stay in suite 453, more popularly known as \"The Talented Mr Ripley\" suite, which was the one they used in filming the movie. The suite has 3 window frontages onto the main canal, two in the bedroom, and the lounge area is one window wide. There is also a huge decck off the bedroom, and a smaller connecting deck off the lounge area. Having just come from another Starwood property in Florence which had much larger, more recently renovated rooms, even this top room at the Europa & Regina was a little disappointing in comparison. Firstly, although they told us they had just renovated the soft furnishings in the room, it had that Venice feel, which I like to call crappy chic: A bit dark, and certainly not my style. In addition, although there was a separate lounge room, there was only one TV in the room, which faced into the bedroom, and couldn't be turned sufficiently to watch in the other area. My biggest complaint, however, was the bathroom. It was a huge space, but also had the look of not being touched in years, and not having been kept in very good condition in the meantime. Although it did have a separate bath and shower, it may as well not have, as the shower was one of the tiniest I've ever seen, with a crappy, half-broken shower head, old fashioned and rusted sliding door, and lime scale on everything. I am a rather slender 5'6\" woman, and I did not have room to lift my arms in the shower to wash under them. Forget entirely trying to bend over to wash one's hair. This is unacceptable. What made it even more unacceptable to me is the fact that there was plenty of open room in this very large bathroom to simply change the shower tray, add a larger shower screen, and double the shower in size very easily... and once that was done, adding a shower head that is not circa 1920 would have also been a nice touch. The bathroom also had only one sink in it, which I can easily live with, but given the size of the bathroom and the fact that it is one of the better rooms in the hotel, it might have been nice to have two basins in there too. Since we were there for 5 nights, I had a chance to get over my angst and disappointment with the bathroom and try to concentrate on being in Venice. Luckily the sun was up and clear each day, so that although it was cool in winter, it was absolutely beautiful skies and beautiful views. Having the lovely terrace with full views of the canal and distant shores was sensational, and the sunrises and gondola singers' music wafting off the water each day made me forget the few minutes each day I had to trudge to the tiny shower box and try in vain to wash myself sufficiently in it. The bed was comfortable, and the lighting in the room good, although it was impossible to turn off the overhead lights without also turning off the bedside lights, another thing I struggled with. It was all or nothing, and no chance to have low lighting just next to the bed when retiring for the night. We ate breakfast each day in the hotel, and the buffet is a very nice one, with some fresh juices, prosecco, reasonable scrambled eggs (which they so often aren't on buffets),also a harder frittata egg dish, cheeses, meats, fresh and canned/dried fruits and nuts, yogurts and yogurt drinks, pastries and tarts, and toast and cereals. And the views from the breakfast room are also nice, but would be even nicer in summer when you could sit out on the deck without freezing! The concierges at the hotel were exceptional, especially Alessandro, who helped us try to organize porter service by calling some colleagues in Milan... pre-arranged porter service in Milan is nearly impossible to arrange, but he found us a compromise that was suitable, for our ensuing visit there after Venice. We also had hotel boat transfers each way from the train station in Veice to the hotel, and it was prompt and efficient, even though this time of year they use taxis and tour guides to escort you to/from the train, rather than their own boats and people. Efficient and worth the money. The title of my review is \"it grows on you\" because this was the reaction someone else who stayed at the Europa & Regina had to it when telling people to give it a chance for a few days. Certainly my fondness for the terraced half of the room grew each day, and I enjoyed that half of the suite... then I would trudge back to the other part in the background where the crappy shower was, and be let down again. I give this hotel 4 stars only because we were in what the front desk manager called \"The best room in the hotel.\" I certainly hope it wasn't THE best, because while it was large by Venetian Standards, and the terrace was nice, the furnishings and certainly the bathroom were a huge let-down. Had it not been such a large room with a view, I would have given my experience there only two or three stars at best. Would I stay here again? If not in this suite, I wouldn't even consider it... and if my intention was to stay in this suite or at another hotel, there are several other properties I would investigate very thoroughly as alternatives, before even considering it. The property could be nice if it had a large renovation to bring it up to proper standards and take a little of the crappy out of the chic. It looks a bit tired, even by Venice standards, and needs a facelift and new bathrooms.", "Date": "December 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGrand & Old World Charm\u201d", "Author": "M0ppy", "ReviewID": "UR122161339", "Content": "We stayed 2 nights at the Westin after a 2 night stay off the island, we got a water taxi from the train station as there was no way we were going to walk with all our luggage - it isnt the cheapest taxi around but with 6 of us it worked out ok.

We were torn between booking at the Hilton across the river and this Westin. We're glad we booked with the Westin as there were so many more things to see within walking distance. Here's what you need to know: Getting There: There are only 2 ways to get to the Westin, by Water Taxi or by Water Bus \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there are no roads with vehicles anywhere. The water taxi is called Water Taxi and is more like a limo (see picture with green leather seats of the boat) and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a private ride costing about $100 USD. The Water Bus is called AliLaguna and this is what we chose to get from the airport to the hotel as it was only about $13 per person. This is the most affordable option however do not choose this if you land at night \u00e2\u20ac\u201c actually I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not even sure if they still run at night. The ride from the airport to the Westin using AliLaguna is great \u00e2\u20ac\u201c however is about 2 hours \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but treat it like an excursion. From getting off the plane to catching the boat which only runs every 30 minutes, the whole process may take you 3 hours from landing to hotel check-in. The boat ride is slow and you get some wonderful views of the city and surrounding islands. Alilaguna stops at each of the smaller islands the. If you have lots of luggage you may want to consider hiring the Water Limo (taxi) which drives you right to the Westin waterfront entrance. Disembarking the water taxi: Finding the hotel is a little tricky since it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on the waterfront and is situated down skinny alleys which makes it hard to find \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially at night. Get off the Alilaguna water bus at the San Marco stop. From here you will have to walk about 3 blocks to the hotel. Keep in mind there is no one to hire/help you carry your luggage or carts to rent, so you will have to carry/roll your own luggage. There are a couple of small bridges to cross over which are staircases with no ramps. I would advise to pack light and use sturdy suitcases with strong wheels to go over the old stone walkways. Once you get directions from the water bus staff for the Westin, as you start walking you will come upon a square with Hotel Bauer, from there cross the bridge and immediately turn left into the alley along the waterway/gondola station. Through the alley is another small boutique hotel and then around the corner is the front entrance to the Westin. Voila! Check In: The check in process was simple and the front desk was very pleasant with basic English skills. They actually use iPads to sign you in. Hotel location: The Westin is surrounded by very expensive shops (Gucci, Prada) and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good 15 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 20 minute walk away to much more affordable options for shopping and restaurants, which is in the district known as Rialto. I think next time I would choose to stay in this area instead. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get me wrong \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there are plenty of restaurants near the Westin, however spaghetti nearby would be 14 euros and if you walk 15 minutes you can get it for 9 euros just as good. Rialto has a grocery store called Billa and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a wonderful place to get the basic goods like water and snacks. Panna 1 litre bottle of water is only .47 pence at Billa versus 3 Euros at a convenience store/deli near the Westin. One day we walked around the whole island(s) from the Westin to Campo Roma, to Rialto and back to San Marco, which took about 6 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 7 hours including shopping and lunch. The whole time we felt completely safe and it was actually really fun to get lost in all of the alleys! The city is all pedestrian only and NOT wheelchair/accessible friendly despite what you may read. Concierge: There were always men at the concierge/bell desk around to help with luggage and shopping packages. The Very helpful, spoke great English and we went to both restaurants he recommended for pizza and then for a fancy meal at Vino Vino. Both were great experiences. Inside Hotel: Restaurant and the bar were very expensive so we did not eat or drink there. For example the Toast (which actually is 2 slices of toast, cream cheese and a slice of ham) is $10 USD. Lobby was a gorgeous marble foyer with a ballroom on the main floor and various smaller meeting rooms. There were only 6 floors to the hotel so it was small for a Westin but very classy with a grand staircase throughout the centre of the hotel so you could take the stairs to your room. Bedroom: We were graciously upgraded to a full suite upon check-in with it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own living room, walk-in closet/change room, very large bathroom and the King bed was 2 singles put together with their own individual linen. This is great as you can not steal each others covers making for a wonderful sleep! The walk in closet had 2 luggage stands and a full length mirror, along with shelving and storage area. The value of the room is about $800 Euros/night but we are SPG Platinum and used points. The bathroom was wonderful with the usual Westin Speakman showerhead, (great water pressure) and in addition a hand held shower head. The bathroom also had heated towel rod. Internet: Can you believe in this day and age there was no wireless internet! Only wired from the desk in the bedroom, which was complimentary. We travel with iPhone so found that frustrating. Everything else was excellent and we hope to return when the warmer weather comes! I figure you can see the room/hotel photos on every other website, so I have included pictures on how to get to the Westin from the San Marco water bus/Alilaguna stop.", "Date": "December 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel in a romantic place\u201d", "Author": "HakeemHaron", "ReviewID": "UR121945112", "Content": "First impression of the hotel was really good.

In an overcrowded city at almost any time of the year it's good to have a hotel that is situated in the heart of the city yet tucked away from the madding crowds!! I would not stay at the more famous Danieli as the location is right on the most touristy part. It was great to arrive by water taxi from the airport. All in all, a great stay but agree that a canal view room is probably a must even if you pay a high premium for that priviledge. Highly recommended.

I could hear the construction people yelling to each other. Really, as a SPG Platinum member, this was what I was given? I complained and they said another room would be available in another 2 hours. After taking an all nighter, the first thing we wanted to do was shower and not wait until 7 PM for our room. However, they let us use the original room given to shower and relax. I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe that they tried to pass of a regular room as an upgrade, and they said they would move me as they had a cancellation (umm sure). The next room given was a 1-bedroom suite that was nice but had no view of the grand canal. I had the same view of the construction overlooking the courtyard. The whole point of spending additional points for an upgrade was for a room overlooking the canal.

Its a 15 minute boat ride from the train station to the hotel and costs 60 euros it is a great way to arrive to the Europa and also see the buildings and the sites on the canals. The Taxi ride is half the price of a gondola ride and serves a purpose at the same time. When we pulled up to the hotel the bellman greeted our taxi at the dock at the Europa and quickly grabbed our bags. We then proceeded to the check in and promptly were checked in. Only problem was we received a accessible room and although it was beautifully furnished with a white marble bath and a view of the canal it had no tub and no where to store our cloths as there was no dresser. The manager came up handled the situation perfectly and moved us the next day to a equal room with a tub which made my wife happy and storage plus a even better view of the Grand Canal. The service thru out our entire stay was excellent and every one was friendly. The room was clean spacious and with a view of the grand canal many nights we sat with a bottle of wine some cheese ,melon and prosciutto and gazed at the gondola's and traffic on the canal. We also had a neat view of the rooftops of Venice and La Salute. If you can get a canal view I suggest you spend the extra doe it is worth it. Ok the little bar on the canal is one of my favorite bars ever, it's open late and they serve pistachios with your drinks the drinks are a little expensive but worth it for the atmosphere and I love pistachios. The patio bar has only 9 tables so its quaint and has awesome views of La Salute the boat traffic on the canal and other unexpected sites and surprises. The concierge were helpful and had a few good suggestions but sometimes we found its best to do some research yourself then get their opinion and have them make the reservation. One of the nice benefits of this hotel is you can get a free ride to the Excelsior Hotel on the Lido Island the boat comes right to the dock and every 30 min and will also drop you back off at the Europa. Its a nice day trip they have a huge beach which is on the Adriatic Sea with lots of cabanas im not sure if you have to be a guest there to rent one for the day but either way its a fun boat ride and a great beach to walk on and swim and there is good people watching too. The vaporetto is the Venice version of a bus on water its a great way to get around and you can get a pass for a few hours up to a week its a fun ride and there are many routes to explore. Also walk outside the main tourist area where the Europa is located Venice has lots of campos and little narrow passages to explore one of which is the Fish and produce market near the Rialto Bridge.

Having read some fantastic reviews on TripAdvisor, I was excited about this location. What we got was not what we expected, however; our experience at the hotel was very disappointing. Our rooms were 148 and 149 on the first floor. Both the hallway in this area and the rooms themselves were unappealing and far below five-star standards. When we checked in we were met with the sight of a dirty linen cart, which remained outside our door for the duration or our visit. Each time we went to our rooms we passed a wash area that had no door. The first floor hallway itself was dark and dingy, not at all like the hallways on the upper floors. Our rooms were tired-looking, mosquito-infested, and decorated with unappealing blood stains on the walls where prior occupants had apparently killed the mosquitoes. The accessory furniture pieces (desks, desk chairs, upholstered chairs) were uncomfortable and worn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they looked like castoffs that had been picked up on the street. On one occasion we had to ask for the room to be vacuumed because it was apparent that this had not been done. The closet in one of the rooms held two cabinets that took up the entire lower level and made it impossible to hang our longer clothing, such as slacks and dresses. My two teenagers liked the bathroom in the room that they shared, saying it was the biggest of our trip, but in the other room the bathroom was small and there was mildew on the tile grout. The hotel has a wonderful setting, right on the Grand Canal, and its common areas are luxurious, not at all like our rooms. The lobby has a lot of interesting features, with large pieces of modern art on display. The day we arrived we had a lovely meal in a courtyard area on the canal - the food was good and the view was excellent. But on the second night of our stay that same courtyard turned into a nightmare as a wedding celebration blared floor-thumping music until midnight - we heard it clearly in our rooms and it was impossible to sleep. We complained to the front desk, as did a number of other hotel guests, but were told that nothing could be done until the function ended. Our room package included buffet breakfast at the hotel restaurant, where the outdoor patio sits right on the canal. The food was good, but mealtimes were very crowded and it was difficult to find seating both days. Since the area is open-air, there were birds everywhere, landing on the food carts and even flying through the large open doorways to the inside of the restaurant. While this is not exactly the fault of the hotel, it was unappetizing and unsettling to see birds landing on the food carts. The restaurant service was mediocre. On the plus side, the hotel is in a very convenient location near St. Mark's Square. Venice is a walking city anyway, and we had no trouble getting to shopping and tourist spots, as well as exploring some of the less busy areas. Clearly, there are nicer rooms at the Europa & Regina, as evidenced by all of the glowing reviews. After our trip I re-read those reviews with some amount of frustration. And I did see a few negative reviews that mentioned complaints similar to ours. I've come to the conclusion that the Europa & Regina is a hotel with two faces. One face is the remodeled and elegant one, which has been the inspiration for many positive comments. The other face is the worn-out part of the hotel that hasn't been renovated and becomes the Regina & Europa experience for a smaller number of unfortunate travelers like ourselves. We aren't the type to make waves, and didn't want to come across as pushy American tourists, but in hindsight I regret not trying to switch rooms while we were at the hotel. We did not get what we paid for or what we expected. For any travelers thinking of staying at the Europa & Regina, I would recommend asking to see your rooms before committing to them, and if possible, avoiding the first floor entirely.", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cFabulous view from canal-front room\u201d", "Author": "mkday", "ReviewID": "UR116278073", "Content": "Just had a wonderful experience at the Westin Europa & Regina.

Arrived at airport, used water taxi arranged via venicelink.com for round trip, worked great, half the price of regular water taxi. I don't know if the route the water taxi took was the normal route but our trip took us under the Rialto Bridge and the entire length of the Grand Canal, a delightful introduction to Venice. Hotel is on the Grand Canal, arrived about noon, room was not ready, not really a big deal. So went off exploring Venice. The location of the hotel is ideal, one block away from Calle Larga XXII Marzo which is the Fifth Avenue or Rodeo Drive of Venice with all the high end shops, and then a few more minutes you are at Piazza San Marco. Walking through Venice is like walking through a maze and there is always a pleasant surprise at every turn. During our three days and two nights we walked everywhere, the only time we took the waterbus was when we went to Murano. Now back to the hotel, when I was making the reservation I was trying to decide between the Westin Europa and the Westin Daneli, I am an SPG member and I had some points to burn and I was looking for value. Room was ready about 5pm, a little late but not a big deal unless you want to make it a big deal, received an upgrade, room was spacious, there was a small alcove with a closet between bedroom and the bathroom. Bathroom equally spacious with hugh bath and separate shower in opposite corner (tiny - i.e. if you dropped your bar of soap it would be tricky to pick it up) hey the shower worked that's the good news. The beds were relatively comfortable they were two beds pushed together to make a king. Room was comfortable, flat screen TV, mini bar, desk and chair with ottoman. The view was of the internal courtyard, when I am on vacation the time I spend in the room is to sleep so what do I care about the view. The room was comfortable and quiet. The concierges were extremely helpful and was the staff, and especially Alex at the front desk, who seemed to want to make sure we were taken care of.

I say just okay becausewe had no problems with the room, it was clean, large, and decent. The problem is with the front staff and trying to get basic hotel services. I swear every time we called to the front desk, the phone would go to an automatic busy, so my boyfriend would have to walk down to the front to make the request in person. They would claim they are busy, but they were not, this was bizarre to me.

I read the same compliants before I booked with Westin, so I know I am not being overly sensitive, this guys needs to go!! Tips: Use the public water taxi, you will save, for example the ride to the train station for 2pp was 12E, while the conceirge advised me to take a private water taxi at 60E. You also get a mini tour of the city from the canal, it makes alot of stops, but you get to feel the city in a different way.

The rate did include breakfast, which was very nice. We did have some issues with the breakfast. First of all, it was exactly the same all three days we were there...Also the hot foods especially the eggs and sausage were cold all three days...they did allow us to order eggs off the menu, but found the consistent cold food to be odd in a hotel of this caliber and price range. The service at the hotel is helpful, but not engaged. The restaurant service was the same; you had to really hunt somebody down after they initially seat you. To be fair, they did always correct everything to our satisfaction; it just felt at times as if we were bothering them. The inside elevator buttons needed replacing as you would have to \"pound\" them to get your floor or any floor to illuminate. The external restaurants recommended by the staff were so-so (we did much better just finding our own) and the \"promotional trip\" recommended by the concierge to the Murano Glass Factory was an experience similar to a \"Time Share\" seminar. Also, Susan ordered a hamburger from Room Service and water and the tab came to over $75 US.

I was travelling with a group of friends and we had a total of 7 rooms. We had all gotten an excellent price for the rooms, but did not get the best rooms over the canal. The rooms were nicely appointed and the bathrooms were all very large and well appointed. The hotel is very close to St Mark's Square which is wonderful. Everything at this Westin is very expensive, from the 5 euro coffee to very expensive food. Breakfast was included in our room price and there was a lot of very good food to satisfy anyone's taste. THE BAD: My only true complaint was with the concierge service for water taxi's to the airport. Our group left at different times for the airport, and therefore requested taxis at those times. We were assured by the head concierge that they would try to combine taxi rides because the taxis were very expensive - 100 euros per boat. There was no attempt to combine rides. I can't help but wonder if the concierge and the staff that help load the taxis get a percentage (or kickback) from the taxi drivers. One woman in our group had to go to the aiport alone (and pay 100 euro) even though a single person was right behind her in a cab and two people were in the cab ahead of her. They requested to be joined for the ride, but the staff said this could not be done because a taxi had been called for each person. My advice is to go to the taxi stand in the hotel a little early and just ask people in line if you can join them. We insisted this be done when it was our turn for the aiport. Another single woman was behind us and they were going to make her pay the 100 euros.

It is a wonderful hotel and we were lucky enough to have a terrace overlooking the basilica of Santa Maria della Salute. It was absolutely enchanting to wake every morning and see the sun coming up over the Lido and San Giorgio Maggiore. The staff was perfectly gracious - warm and welcoming, and were patient with my halting Italian. We had coffee one morning in the dining room, delivered another morning, and a nightcap one night in the bar. We took our drink outside to sit in the cool evening air canalside. Just a wonderful end to a long day of sightseeing. Those were the only time we used the restaurant part of the hotel and we enjoyed our limited contact. The bathrooms were fine, large and nicely appointed with Etro bath products, plenty of towels, and a comfortable bathtub. The room had a lot of closet space and (important these days with phones and computers) plenty of electrical sockets. We brought our own adapters but the concierge can get them for you, too. We had a king size bed reserved and found two twin beds pushed together and made up separately. That was fine, but my half of the bed moved when I turned in bed, often waking me up. An odd sensation. The room was also very, very warm at all times. The air conditioning did not seem to be working yet, so we had to keep the terrace doors open which then made mosquitoes an irritation, but not massive swarms, just one or two here and there. We did not receive turn-down service (which doesn't bother me) at first and then did, and then on our last night we received slippers and floor mats, but the bed wasn't turned down. This was more confusing than a serious lapse, but it did make us wonder what we should be receiving. Internet access can be purchased, but if you have a laptop that does not have an Ethernet port (like our Mac), you have to use the lobby for the WiFi. I was not happy with this, because it meant dressing and going downstairs just to post to Facebook or check email. It's expensive and you don't really get to use it that much. There is a VeniceConnected deal for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5 per day. I tried to buy it, but they send you a Username and Password to your email address, and, well, I couldn't get access to my email without the Internet, so that was a waste. The hotel, for the first three nights of our stay, had a wine merchant meeting going on so things were always hopping. The hotel quited down once that group left. There was no less service because of it, the hotel always seemed well-staffed.

By doing this and getting off at the first San Marco stop you are a super easy, one little bridge walk from the hotel. As stated everywhere - the hotel is in a terrific location - minutes from everyhting. Reality in Venice is if you aren't dragging suitcases, walking is the fastest and easiest mode of transportation. Venice was the most expensive city we stayed in due to the fact that delivery is that much more expensive and labor intensive than anywhere else. There are ways to control costs, but expect to pay more period. We were given a large comfortable room facing into the alley on a higher floor - it was not a problem for us. Everything was ship shape updated and well maintained. Hotel staff was excellent - we got very good dinner recommendations at a couple of nice places. Seafood is king in Venice - so if you would like to enjoy a variety of fish and shellfish, this is the place for it. Being that this was our third stop, we learned how to economize by having breakfast at a bakery and eating standing up at a counter looking out the window - just like real italians.

We did not do pre-planned tours in Venice proper. Venice was just fun walking and exploring and getting lost.in. We spent most of our days enjoying the spectacle that is Venice. We did a short boat ride/tour to Murano, Burano and Torcello. You can purchase tickets right at the pier near where you got off to get to the hotel. The ticket booth can't be missed. You won't get alot of exploring time - especially in Murano, where they take you right to a glass works to see a short demo followed by an opportunity to purchase some of the beautiful glassware. You had a bit more time to wander in Torcello and Burano. The boat did include a narration by a multi-lingual guide, but due to the heavy fog there wasn't much to see. Do go to the bathroom before you leave on your trip - public WC's were scarce and those available were charging userous rates since they effectively had a monopoly. You can take Vaporrato's on your own to these islands if you don't want to be controlled by the \"guided tour\". Bottom line - The Westin Regina Europa was a terrific home base for us in Venice.

We found the staff to be very helpful, the suite impressive and the location excellent. Our only minor complaint is that there are no tea and coffee facilities in the rooms. Our only major complaint - and it is a major one - is the pricing of drinks and food in Venice. Pretty much everywhere we visited in Venice, the prices of drinks and food bore no relation whatever to the cost of providing them - or to the quality offered. For example, perhaps Harrys Bar nearby is trading on its reputation when it charges 19 euros for a bellini - \"buono ma non cosa buono\" - perhaps. How though can a hotel (the Europa) justify asking 10 euros for a tin of Coca Cola that can be bought for 60 cents in the nearby supermarket? This was not at the bar or from room service - it was just from the minibar. Other in house dining and minibar prices were similarly inflated. We did not eat at the Europa - but I have to say that none of the 6 or so Venice restaurants we visited provided us with a meal of he quality we could easily prepare at home in our own kitchen. All charged extortionate prices regardless. The only exception were the little coffee bars that locals frequent - where good expresso and cicchietti can be had at reasonable prices. I am afraid that we were put off Venice by the pure profiteering of so many establishments we visited. It is so extreme as to be insulting. I should say clearly though that we are glad we visited Venice and that we enjoyed our stay at the Europa and Regina. The hotel even thoughtfully provided a (free) bottle of champagne on ice as a gift for my wife's birthday! A very kind gesture that was much appreciated. I would certainly be happy to stay at the Europa and Regina if visiting Venice again. The problem is that there are so many other wonderful places in the world to visit that I doubt that Venice will rise again to the top of our list due to its profiteering prices. My final plea to Venice (and Rome) is why not do something about those street hawkers pestering people to buy roses and those damn silly luminous helicopter things? They are a complete nuisance - and I have seen them actually pretending to give a rose to an elderly couple and then harass them to pay. Similarly the (apparently) Roma beggar women that drape themselves over the pavements begging made their appearance also. Not as annoying as the flower sellers but after you have seen your first 100 or so \"identi-beggars\" you realise that it is no less a scam than the rose sellers and the restaurants.", "Date": "January 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cLovely Stay\u201d", "Author": "sisisisisisi", "ReviewID": "UR91965760", "Content": "We stayed at the Westin for three nights during November and had a great time.

While the location was excellent, the hotel rooms and staff left a lot to be desired. I would say you are better off booking a 3-star hotel with the same experience and saving yourself some dough. 1. Despite being told that our room had been recently renovated, our room felt old and dingy. The room smelled of mothballs. In addition, despite being in a non-smoking room, the room smelled like smoke all night long (I don't know if it was just bad ventilation?). We did mention this problem to the front desk and they said nothing. 2. While the front desk staff was really friendly and helpful, the Concierge staff was rude and unhelpful. They seemed annoyed any time you asked them a question. They were unwilling to help us figure out alternatives when our flight was canceled due to weather. And finally, one of the Concierges was actually drunk when we went to speak to him about dinner options. He smelled of alcohol. Despite asking him for a quaint and intimate non-touristy dinner option, he sent us to a huge, brightly lit tourist trap less than a block from the Rialto. 3. We were never offered Wellies to deal with the flood waters. After staying for 2 days, we happened to hear the concierge offer them to someone else...as we were leaving! 4. The hotel was unwilling to help us when the passageway to the hotel flooded. We definitely understand that the streets can flood in Venice in November/December. That being said, many of the other hotels we passed provided a walking platform for their guests to connect to the main platform. When the flood waters prevented us from accessing the street to get to the airport ferry, the hotel's only option was to book us a 100 euro taxi boat. In the end, we made them book us a boat to get to the ferry, which still cost us 40 euro (for a 3 minute ride). Since flooding is an ongoing problem, I would expect a hotel of that caliber and price point to provide assistance and options for their guests.

I believe that Westin bought 2 hotels (the Europa and the Regina) and re-badged them as a Westin hotel. For those worried that you won't get a true feel of Italy by staying in a \"chain\" hotel, don't worry. You walk in and it's simply breath-taking, from the marble walkways and walls to the glass chandeliers and the decor -- all very classic Italian. The property is beautiful, and the waterfront entrance allows for some great views and photo-ops along the Grand Canal. 3) Because we were on our honeymoon, we were given a very generous upgrade to a \"partial grand canal room.\" Upon arrival, we had cake and champagne awaiting us, along with a personalized note from the manager -- what a great touch! The room was beautiful though small -- but the couch at the foot of the bed made the room seem bigger because it offered a place to sit and utilize the space you had. The bathroom was very spacious and had beautiful granite countertops I believer. The \"partial\" view was actually a fantastic view of the Grand Canal, though it was looking at it from the side of a building, not from a grand canal front terrace -- but hey for a \"partial\" view it was a very very great view! 4) The staff was extremely courteous and helpful -- answering all questions we had. Check-in was speedy and although we did not utilized the bar, restaurant, or room services, they looked amazing. 5) Overall, I would say that our stay was amazing.

May be this is why Anthony Mingella chose the Hotel as one of the locations in his film The Talented Mr Ripley and Monet chose to paint one of his pieces of the Grand Canale. Our room was extremely spacious and very comfortable and gave us spectacular views of the above both during the day and at night when these sites were floodlit --- perfect !!! The staff of the hotel were very friendly and attentive to every detail. The concierge staff of Ilario, Roberto, Alberto and Marco were all extremely helpful and I was made to feel that any request was no problem whatsoever.

Room 442: threadbare carpet (and not just a little threadbare or in one spot), dinged up dirty walls, multi-painted furniture that I guess someone judged shabby chic, when it was really just multiple badly painted coats that equal just shabby. Add to that an elevator that skipped floors repeatedly and was finally taken out of service and you have to ask what are the Westin folks thinking? It's not enough to have beautiful public rooms and then put your guests in rooms that are less than what we'd accept in the states as a Motel 6. If you're looking for luxury folks, pick the Cipriania, Danieli, Gritti or Bauer but avoid this one unless they remodel or give you a pillow and blanket and let you sleep in the public rooms, which are not representative of what is upstairs.

This was our 3rd stop on our European trip and the two previous hotels were Le Meridiens. After getting off the public shuttle boat, we spent maybe 30 minutes wandering around trying to find this hotel. The main doors are located in a very small alleyway, and there were definitely times when I felt it was just odd/awkward to be walking through that area later at nighttime. I can't even remember how to get back to the hotel now, but my husband was the navigator anyways. All I can say is to look for Prada, and once you see that, you are 5 minutes from the hotel. Look on the floor for signs pointing to \"Europa\" or \"Regina\" hotel. The reason why its called the Europa & Regina is because it used to be two hotels an after the Westin took over, it is now one bigger hotel. You can absolutely see the difference from the canal view. The room keys are extremely old school and you have to return them to the lobby before you leave for the day. I understand that this is probably a historical building so many things within the rooms would seem quite odd. We had a partial canal view which was absolutely lovely, especially at night. The room is divided a bit awkwardly: there is a small \"hallway\" where the closet and the safe are, and also where you can store your suit case. The bathroom is unusually large, although the shower stall was teensy (as is the norm for European hotels, apparently). It was clad in all beautiful marble and felt very luxurious. The bedroom itself just fit one bed, a small mini bar and a small TV. Nothing else. The room itself is decorated with very old world feeling wallpaper and the furniture matched this decor as well.

And in Venice it certainly is. Having had huge doubts about booking a \"chain hotel\" in this particular city, we were amazed.

Once there, the reception staff & concierge are - honestly - as rude and unfriendly as you kind of expect in Venice. But the location of the hotel, with a bar & breakfast restaurant literally sitting ON the Grand Canal, was amazing. The room size is incredibly big and the bathroom is - again, for Venitian relations - huge. seperate shower & bathtub and loads of space everywhere. The only downside was the floor we were on. - it had an inner-courtyard roof right at the window-sill, so we didn't dare to sleep with open windows. We might have seen too many horror movies, i guess. So avoid the 1st floor if you can influence your room allocation. (Hotel part Regina). The fittings of the room were gorgeous, and housekeeping was very clean. the aircondition is poor, and with the window closed, that was not a very nice sleeping experience. Service in general...well...it's Venice and maybe you need to take it with a pinch of salt. on our arrival night, there was a big wedding going on and that's the downside of big hotels like that - events & corporates like them. the breakfast quality is very average and by far not worth the money. Reduce it to a cup of cappucino & a glass of bubbly and enjoy the view and hustle & bustle as the grand Canal awakes, and than, make a move and get a proper cornetto con crema or whatever you desire at one of the little coffee shops off the main streets.

From the lobby, you can pickup the hotel's wifi as well as another free wifi. Ihave been traveling to Venice for several years (40 plus) and the Hotel Regina and Europa is my favorite. They recently acquired and renovated the neighboring Casa Borlozzi and legend has it that the countess still lives there and has all of the front rooms facing the Grand Canal. It is rumored that the countess still lives there and has an apartment at the Excelsior Lido hotel (no longer a Westin). In any case, my favorite pastime in Venice is sitting outside at Tiepolo, the hotel's terrace bar, for a glimpse of the infamous 90 year old countess to show up as well as use my SLR camera to take thousands of pictures of gondolas and S Maria Della Salute. If you are driving, I recommend you leave your car at piazza Roma. This hotel only has gondola parking and I doubt you will be arriving in one. .late breaking news. Aldo from the bar whom has been working here for 33 years indicated the Countess has died and that a Baroness lives next door. Just think, you too can be living like royalty at this hotel or more like casanova. Iprefer Casanova and so does my wife. :) this hotel was recently renovated and everything is new and tvs are large flat screens. If traveling from the train station to this hotel, take vaporetto number 1 or 2 and get off at the first st. Mark's stop. When you get off, you will see Harry's Bar. Go straight to the major walkway and turn left and walk straight. You will see a baroque church to your left. This is your clue that you will need to pickup your bags and cross the bridge where the gondoliers are. You should see a small gold sign for the hotel above and to the left I dictating that you are to go down the alley and follow the signs for the hotel. The hotel is on the Grand Canal and perhaps you are fortunate to get a room with a view. Ask for Roberta when checking in. She is efficient and very nice and I really enjoyed talking to her when checking in. Please experience two things when coming here. One is the Tiepolo terrace bar. The drink menu is extensive and if you do not drink, you have to try their iced coffee, cafe shakerato. It is better than anything you will have in Italy and it is the best. My favorite drinks are the Venetian Spritz or Champagne cocktail. the champagne cocktail comes in champagne glasses modeled after Marie Antoinette's breasts and I o ly wish she were a 42EEE. :) when going to the bar, be sure Luianna serves you or Aldo whom has defined bar service. The second thing to try here is the breakfast buffet. Go back and change your reservation to have breakfast included. You have everything from omelets made to order to salmon, prosciutto, ham, French fries, stewed tomatoes, pastries, cappuccino, teas, yogurts, cereal, fresh squeezed orange juice and an assortment of juices and bacon and sausage and many more things including cereal. You cannot go wrong and breakfast is one of the most important meals of the day....What I did not mention is that the breakfast area is also outside on the Grand Canal and you can partake of gondolas and other boat traffic whilethesun rises on Santa Maria. Della Salute. What better way to start your day. I think that when you get here, you will not want to leave the beauty of the hotel. I only wish I discovered this hidden gem earlier. I also like the Danieli and Gritti Palace but find the terrace bar and breakfast area the best. I also thi k your kids will enjoy feeding the little finches (birds) At both locations. :)", "Date": "August 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "franklin lakes New Jersey, USA", "Title": "\u201cFairy tale experience\u201d", "Author": "jackandmary1", "ReviewID": "UR74394245", "Content": "We arrived in Venice after a long journey for a three night stay prior to embarking on a cruise.

So I expected something wonderful, but what a disappointment. We walked into our room, the room was rather large as there was a hallway leading into the room, with a closet, bathroom, and then a room w/ the bed. Expecting a beautiful view of the canal, or something similar, I opened the window to find another building about 4 feet away. There was no view at all. Further, the room was rundown. The paint was chipping off the walls, the decor was extremely dated, and the bed was no \"heavenly bed\" as Westin advertises. Further, our room smelled like mold. It was awful, so we told the hotel staff. They said they would take care of it. When we returned to the room, it appeared that they just sprayed something minty in the room to cover the awful odor. We attempted to open the window to perhaps neutralize the odor, but there were people smoking outside and the smoke smell came into our room. We went to the bar one evening and ordered a bottle of wine. There was a lot of flies in the room, and a fly landed in my husband's full glass. When we told the waiter, he took the glass of win and gave my husband a new empty glass. This happened once again, and this time, the waiter just drained the fly out and gave my husband the glass of wine back. I was completely appalled.

The hotel has a great location, just a very short yet very pleasant stroll from St. Mark's Square. It's also right on the Grand Canal, directly across from the Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute. Great views can be had from the hotel cafe's seating areas right on the canal, or canal facing rooms, of the Basilica, Venetian architecture, the Grand Canal, passing boats and gondolas, etc! Venice's walkways are quite narrow and maze-like (which is a big part of their charm), but it can make finding this hotel difficult were you to attempt to find it on foot after getting a water bus from the train station. We took a water taxi, though, which dropped us off right at the hotel's dock and so that was not an issue. There is some signage out and about to direct you to the hotel if you're walking (bronze plaques they've placed in the surrounding area to send you in the right direction) but familiarizing oneself with google maps or even asking directions would probably be a good idea if you were to attempt to walk from a bus stop to the hotel's entry (in a small, quiet and cute square) when first arriving. As the name of the hotel suggests, it's actually 2 different palaces joined together in to a single hotel. You can still detect this in the facade and some of the interior layout, but they've done quite a nice job making common areas spacious and quite opulent and combining what used to be two structures in to one large hotel. Venice is not cheap, and the same goes for this hotel. While pricey, though, I gathered it was comparable to other similar hotels nearby (if not even better priced in many respects). Our room was very spacious, had a canal view, though was somewhat sparsely appointed. No real work station or area, limited storage to unpack in to, but a comfy bed and a very nice bathroom. By all means, a pleasant room to stay in. A chilled Bellini bottle, complements of the hotel, welcomed us to our room upon arrival, along with fresh fruit and a friendly note from the manager. Throughout the stay, service was good. We did use the concierge a couple of times for suggestions and advice and they were quite helpful (it did seem that their first instinct was to suggest tours and activities for which the hotel would get a kickback or would make a little money on as well, but they were by no means pushy about this and whenever I inquired about alternates to those first suggestions, they were more than happy to oblige). We spent many a quiet moment out along the Grand Canal, sipping espresso at the hotel's cafe. Service there was great and very friendly, food was good, and the view could not be beat. Again, the hotel is very well-situated. It does not open directly up on to a busy walkway or crowded area, and the front door is in a quiet, small, quaint little piazza you must go down a couple winding and narrow walkways to get to. This was perfectly fine by us, though, as it felt like a nice respite and escape, yet no more than a very short (literally a minute or two, if even) stroll to more hustle and bustle (whatever hustle and bustle exists in Venice, that is!). St. Mark's is a very short stroll away, passing by tons of great shops and restaurants along the way. You can walk out of the hotel's front doors and go any direction, strolling down any walkway you choose, and be treated to beautiful sights and images. It was convenient to everything we wanted to see and do. I did use Starwood points to pay for our stay, so can't really comment on room pricing beyond saying that initial research suggested it was a great option, price-wise, for the location. Incidentals (food, drink, room service, and even laundry) were priced as expected. All in all, a very satisfying stay.l", "Date": "June 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel!!!\u201d", "Author": "ChrisHill_9", "ReviewID": "UR67977137", "Content": "What an amazing hotel!

My review will likely perpetuate what seems to be a common occurrence in this forum over the past several years. I will complain about the attitude and poor service received at the front desk, the hotel management will reply to this review by apologizing, assuring me that this is not normal practice and that my valuable input will help them improve service and then many more reviews after mine will probably make the same comments, because based on my recent visit, the hotel has done nothing to improve service. This is really too bad, because the hotel's location can't be beat, right on the Grand Canal, a stones throw from San Marco and yet in an out of the way quiet spot. It would be hard to beat the bar and breakfast restaurant location, literally floating on the Grand Canal and the breakfast buffet was the best we had in Italy, you have to try the mango smoothie. We booked a Grand Canal View room for almost $900 CDN a night and received a small, but nice room but in a partial alcove with a full wall on one side of the window and a partial wall on the other which resulted in little more than a straight ahead view of the canal, there was no view up and down the canal, which was the greatest disappointment of the entire trip, especially since my travel agent tried several times to contact the hotel to ensure a view, but received no cooperation. From the moment we arrived, even before complaining about the room we were treated with disinterest and an underlying attitude that because we booked through a travel agent and not directly with the hotel, we were second-class citizens and our Starwood membership meant nothing. When we asked to be moved, I even offered to pay extra, a 5-minute discussion in Italian in the back room resulted in the hotel being suddenly and miraculously full. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really too bad they won't subject themselves to a much needed attitude adjustment because this is a great facility in a great location that could be a great hotel.", "Date": "June 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "los angeles", "Title": "\u201cGreat location - great room\u201d", "Author": "sanjali22", "ReviewID": "UR67541923", "Content": "Just returned from a trip to venice, vienna and prague.

We arrived by train and took the water buses. Unfortunately, there was some sort of competition going on so the water bus service was severely disrupted. We finally arrived at the San Marco Vallaresso station (the closest to the hotel) and found our hotel. The hotel is beside Hotel Bauer but you have to walk down the corridor towards Hotel Lisbona, take a right and then left. The signage to find the hotel was non-existent so we were lucky the gondola folks were quite helpful. Check-in was tortuous. There were about 3 people in line but the front desk people were severely understaffed. There is an overabundance of paper they need to fill out and then they usually personally escort you to your room. Problem is, that left a period of about 15 min where there was nobody at front desk. The lobby is incredibly luxurious and expansive. While walking towards the private boat dock, there's a huge sitting area to the right. My biggest surprise was that there were no shops in the hotel. I guess with all the high-end shops just outside, there probably isn't a need. As a SPG Platinum, I was upgraded to an unbelievable suite. Yes, we were personally shown the room by front desk. The E&R complex is made of several buildings so I got a room in the back building on the 7th (highest) floor. On this floor, there are only 3 suites that divide a 360 degree view. Luckily, I got the view facing the canal. The outdoor patio was large and had a sofa and table. We spent some time outside on the patio and it was great. Our sitting area was large and had 2 sofas with a coffee table. There was also a good-sized working desk. There was plenty of storage space for clothes. We had a large and comfy bed. The bathroom was large and luckily had a shower curtain. The shower head seems to have heavy hard water build-up so we couldn't get good water pressure. One funny thing is that both myself and my wife almost slipped in the bathtub. We never do that. Perhaps the type of enamel? The bathroom had Etro products which really seemed to matter to my wife. The towel rack was heated - nice touch. Given the nature of the rooms on my floor, noise was never a problem. For the TV, it states there's a Japanese channel but it never worked. It's small and not LCD so I was a little surprised. Internet was either 6 EUR/hr or 12 EUR/day, which is reasonable for Europe. The internet speeds were very decent. There was a free bottle of water every day but no bottle opener in the room. I had to call Service Express for it. On the topic of Service Express, I had to call them on 2 occasions. On the 2nd occasion, I had to call 4 times as nobody was answering the phone. The concierges were pretty good and asked what sites we had seen. Once known, they offered other suggestions. We did approach them for a free water taxi service to Murano. Of course, nothing is really free and we did pick up a piece at one of the glass factories. However, that piece was really nice and we were glad we went. We did go to Tiepolo Cafe - the hotel cafe that has the covered patio onto the Grand canal and beside the private boat dock. Yes, prices are expensive but service was excellent. Also, the view is priceless. Around the area, if you take a left once you hit the main drag, there was a nice little cafe that we went to most mornings. It's called \"Snack - Gi Bar\" and it had very decent prices with a good selection of pastries and sandwiches. There are 2 banks just across from the cafe - Banca Intesa and Deutsche Bank. For some unknown reason, my bank card wouldn't work with Deutsche Bank but worked fine with Banca Intesa. Around the San Marco Piazza area, just behind and to the left of the Basilica, we found a resto called Falciano. Prices were ok but food was superb. Honestly, we ate all over Venice but this was probably the best resto we found. Leaving for the airport, we decided to take the Alilaguna. It was pretty convenient as it was pretty close to the San Marco Vallaresso station. I strongly suggest to pay for the Linea Oro. It costs a bit more but there's only 1 stop at San Marco Zaccaria and it's straight to the airport. Because it costs a bit more, most people don't pay for it so there were only 3 couples on the entire boat! There was plenty of room for everyone. I mention this because it was just as fast as a water taxi. In fact, for most of the trip, there was a water taxi beside us who was going at the same speed. Lastly, I should mention Venice is a shopping paradise. It seems 99.9% of folks are there for sight-seeing. We found the stores had stocks for stuff that we couldn't find in Singapore, Vienna, Milan, and Paris. Overall, it seems one's experience highly depends on the room you get. This is my 2nd time to Venice and my previous hotel had tiny rooms. However, considering the experience I received, I was more than satisfied with my stay - even with the few glitches encountered. The service offered by front desk and the concierges cannot be faulted. I will definitely return the next time I'm in Venice.", "Date": "June 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, average hotel\u201d", "Author": "Urban_Traveler_100", "ReviewID": "UR67262657", "Content": "The best thing about this Westin is the location -- it's just a few blocks off of St. Mark's Square in an upscale shopping district (Tod's, Ferragamo, Bottega Veneta, LV, etc all outside your door - my husband was less than thrilled about that!). Other than that, it's an average hotel. The room we got was very small - the bed took up most of the room, and I could barely open the closet door, which swung out. The bathroom was very large and luxurious by comparison, with it's own window, large marble countertop and towel warmer! As with all Westin's, the bed itself was great. We had a room tucked away from the hallway, so no sound issues, but as with all older hotels, I don't think the soundproofing is great. One thing to note is that they provide a large physical key (it's electronic, but made to look like an old-fashioned key), which you leave with the concierge each time you go out, and pick-up as you come in. Overall, it didn't really bother us, but it was a little annoying on days when we came in and out a lot. The service was okay -- the concierges answered all of our questions, but they gave the collective impression that we were disturbing them. One nice service touch was that they left a bottle of sparkling wine for us as a welcome gift, as we booked under my mother's name, who has stayed here in the past before. Definitely have a drink at the waterfront bar -- it's pricey, but great view and very relaxing. Overall the hotel was okay -- I realize European hotels are generally smaller, pricier, and older than American ones, so this one may be very representative.

For instance, the fact that breakfast wasn't included in the rate, free internet wasn't offered, etc. Perhaps it's that the hotel is more geared towards the well-heeled clients, but charging for internet when you are already spending so much on the room seems petty.

The deal included 3 nights for the price of 2, and frankly I didn't expect much in terms of the room from this deal, expecting to be at the 'bottom end' of the E&R experience. We are familiar with Venice, and arrived at the hotel via Vaporetto without too much searching, although the entrance is a little off the beaten track (but signed). Check-in was easy and our BA voucher was accepted without a problem. We were shown to our 6th floor room by the check-in receptionist, a nice touch. Our room was superb - one of the best we've stayed in anywhere in the world. The main room was huge and sumptious, with tasteful furnishings, flat screen TV, sofa and chairs, mini-bar and huge bed. I was pleased to see that a big comfy Z bed for our 9 year old daughter had been installed and made up ( I've known hotels to fail that particular test). The room had a large balcony with table and chairs overlooking the Venice skyline. We had a partial view of the Grand Canal. The room had a separate dressing room and a massive marble bathroom, with twin sinks, snazzy double headed shower, robes and plentiful toiletries. Breakfast was included in our rate, and was a superb extensive buffet, taken each morning looking over the Grand Canal. Perfect. The communal areas of the hotel are beautiful, marbled affairs, and it well worth a look around the ground floor. Staff were at all times extremely polite and attentive. The hotel is convenient for San Marco and a couple of Vaporetto stops - Giglio and San Marco Valloressa. Don't be put off by the proximity to the crowds - they disappear as soon as you turn down the side alleys for the hotel. The only downside to the E&R is the staggering price of additional items. We paid 10 Euros for each minibar beer, and a staggering 149 Euros for room service the first night which apart from a bottle of wine, was a simple affair (but beautifully presented on a wheeled table brought to our room). We had lunch on the terrace on our departure day; 2 sandwiches, a couple of beers and coffees - 100 Euros!! Sure, we knew the cost, but I've never experienced prices like these! However, the stay was so special that the withering prices were soon forgotten. If you can stay here, do so. It is memorable. And if you can afford to arrive/depart by water taxi, at the E&R's own jetty, do that as well.

As I see again and again in these reviews, the lesson is that you must prevail and (courteously) request a different room. This experience was no exception, as we used Starwood points to book. The desk clerk personally showed us to our room, which \u00e2\u20ac\u201c though we had booked an upgraded partial canal view \u00e2\u20ac\u201c had a view of a flat tar-paper roof and a strongly stale, wet carpet smell. We were surprised that she did not seem to notice the smell of the room. I asked if there was another option, with a view of something other than a roof, since we had after all booked a partial canal view. After bringing us back to the lobby and checking, she found another room for us. This one was a huge improvement over the first, and we were quite pleased. It evidently was a handicapped-accessible room, as it had a second shower in the very huge bathroom, and had more open area in the bedroom area. We thought that they must keep this room available in the event someone needed it; but we were staying only 2 nights and it was not the height of the season (late April). We were glad that they gave us use of it for our time here. That said, it had a straight-on view of the grand canal, but from a building set back between two other buildings, sort of a corridor-type view. There were two small step-out balconies in the main room, and two in the bathroom that faced into a courtyard with views of pretty terra-cotta roofs. There was also a small separate room upon entrance that was a dressing area with closet and cabinets. The bathroom really was huge, with an accessible shower (curtain around an open area), as well as a regular tub shower with dual shower heads, and twin sinks. We printed the directions to the hotel from the website and had no problems finding it. If you take the regular Alilaguna ferry from the airport, you will have to hoist your luggage over one small bridge before you get to the hotel. There is also a private dock for water taxi arrival that looked like a very nice way to arrive at the hotel.

We had a room on the Grand Canal and the room was beautiful and the view perfect, we had 2 small balconies and my husband would get coffee sent up each morning and would stand on the balcony watching the Gondolier's get ready for the day. It was like living someone elses life! We booked the room well in advance on a deal with Starwood \"pay 3 get 4 nights\". Breakfast however was not in the tariff, but we had breakfast most days in the hotel as the restaurant was beautiful and again a view of the Grand Canal, this was an extravagance but the staff only charged us for what we had, so instead 60 euro it was generally about 35 euros each. It is a great experience if you can run to it. The staff in hotel were all very good, of course there is always an exception and the Concierge staff were the exception \"useless\". I emailed prior to our arrival in Venice and asked them to give me some suggestions and what was on over christmas. I would have thought that they had a standard email with links for different sites, events,tours and customised it to the time of year....oooohhh no... I got an email back aking me to email them closer to the date and they may have something for me, to add insult to injury i booked a musical evening \"an opera in a plazzo\" and when we asked for direction they told us they could have booked for us. They were really second rate at this first class hotel. I did find and book a guide with no thanks to the hotel and I would highly recommend her she is fourth generation Venetian Luisella Romeo her email is [--] ..she tailored the tour to our requirements and we were both delighted this really added to our experience of the Venice.

That alone is worth a lot. Our room had a partial view of the Grand Canal which is priceless in itself. The room was a large size compared to European hotels. Our room had a double bed fused together. Unfortunately we weren't staying too long. Wall to wall carpet with a tapestry type of fabric on the walls. No detail spared for the crown molding in the room. Gives you the feel of an upper end hotel. You pay a hefty sum for hotel accomodations in Venice but this place helps to justify what you are paying. The entryway and hallways to the restaurant are adorned with paintings, sculptures and other artwork that describes Venice and the glasswork from nearby Murano. Architecture is excellent throughout the hotel. I would love to come back here. Bathroom in room is spacious, adorned with granite and more shower and bath spiquets than us Americans are use to. A safe was in the room as well. Great service as well. Banquet room were available and in use. The Not So Good Although near Piazza San Marco, it is not the easiest place to find. Near the Vaparetto (Water Bus) stop next to the main Vaparetto stop for Piazza San Marco. Gondola are parked nearby and the hotel can arrange a water taxi if needed. Take the Vaparetto, it's cheaper. If I didn't see the sign pointing to the alleyway, I wouldn't have found the place. However most places in Venice for the first time traveller is not easy to find. Easy to get lost in the Hotel. Make sure you pay attention when they are showing you the room. Also noticed some mildew in the bathroom just above the shower (not much, just a little). It is average to pay at least $300 a night in Venice so factor that in your budget and this place is no exception. Fortunately our travel points took care of our stay.

I highly recommend this hotel for its location and comfort, especially if you get a good rate (< $300 USD) or have points for a free night. I wouldn't pay $600 per night since it's not luxurious, but at the right price it's a lovely, quiet hotel with a very nice staff.

I've been to Venice 5+ times and would definitely recommend this hotel if you can get a decent price (Venice hotels are very expensive and often have worn old-world decor).

This is a jaw dropping ride, as no matter what image you had in your mind as to what the canals would be like, actually being in the canals is an experience unto itself. The 15 minute ride led us to the Canal entrance of the hotel, which is equally jaw-dropping. The entire staff including housekeeping, front desk, concierge, waiters and bell-hops all were first class.

A suggestion if you are renting a car to travel to Venice, do not rent from Alamo/National/Maggiore, as the reservation indicated the drop-off was in Venice, but was actually in a town a few miles West of the island of Venice itself.

On my recent visit, Roberto and Massimo were the perfect concierges and gentlemen, helping with everything from arranging a massage, to dinner reservations and transportation. Really helpful and pleasant. The only staff drawback were some of the guys in the restaurant.

We stayed for 3 nights on SPG Points and Cash. We arrived to the hotel at about 4:30 PM by water taxi. If you are staying at this hotel, take a water taxi. The taxi pulls up directly in front of the hotel on the water and the bellman immeditaley greets you and takes your bags. Way cool. So we checked in and were in a standard room. We asked to be upgraded, the only thing they had was a suite with a view of the water. This certainly wasn't a typical upgrade, so I agreed to the 75Euro per night fee. We made our way to the room, and it was great. Huge bathroom, wonderful view of the canal, awesome bed, etc... The room was amazing. About two minutes after we checked in the Bellman had our bags and set them in the closet, on the ground. Didn't bother to use the TWO luggage racks that we're in the room. I thought that was rather odd. Didn't ask us if we needed anything, rude, etc. We went and had drinks and a small appetizer at the bar, which were amazing. You're literally on the water. In my opinion, it's the best view in Venice. Without making this review a novel, I will discuss what I liked and what I really didn't like. DISLIKED: 1. I'm not sure I would of agreed to stay in this room, had I known I would be waking up each morning to the noise of construction directly above our room. Of course, nobody told us this at check-in, on their website, etc. Certainly, our room was not the only room affected by this noise. It was really loud, and from 8 to 5. I don't like the hotel telling me what time I will be woken up at. 2. The TV didn't work, when we got to the room. It took them 24 hours to get it work. They needed to bring us a new TV. 3. Internet, didn't work either the second day. 4. Shower didn't work for 6 hours one day. We were advised the night before, they would be doing work on the plumbing, 5. Didn't credit the right amount of starpoints to our account. Don't want to get into all the details of the negatives, but they were some major issues, and weren't handled as well as I would of liked. LIKED 1. The location is amazing. On the water, two minute walk to St. Marks 2. The room was huge and newly renovated, if there's no construction going on, request room 419. 3. The food was pretty good, with the exception of the room service we ordered for lunch one day. Although their breakfast buffet is 52 euro, that's like 70 US people. 4. MOST of the staff was great. The bartenders were very cool. Servers needed some help, specifically at breakfast. 5. Furnishings throughout the hotel were great. At the end of the day I would definitely return to this property as the issues we had are correctable. Put our bags on the luggage racks, make sure the tv and internet work, finish your construction and let guests know about it. Compensation for the issues: internet was comped for the two days we used it, free dinner at the restaurant, and 3000 starpoints. i'm not sure if I'm happy with what we recieved, but that's what we were offered. I just thought the construction was a slap in the face to its guests. The GM was nice enough to call the St. Regis in Rome and tell them we would be checking in the next day, I'm glad he did as we were upgraded at check-in, met the gm, and had fruit basket waiting in the room for us.

Never mind 5 star, it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even be acceptable in a 4 star! The room had a partial canal view and small balcony, which we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect given the cheap price paid for the room and no SPG status. The interior of the hotel was extremely\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.well\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.bling, in a European style. Lots of antique furniture, gold leaf, chandeliers etc. The bar looked nice, as did the restaurant, but with commensurately high prices, as is the norm for Venice and as a result we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t try either, preferring to eat out. The reception staff and concierge were friendly and professional and willing to help at all times. The best thing about the hotel is its location. Not only the view onto the Grand Canal/Lagoon, but the fact its only a stone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s throw from San Marco, the main designer shopping area, and the nearest waterbus stop. Although very central, the hotel is tucked away and doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get any passing traffic, and we were able to sleep soundly at night, even with the balcony doors open slightly. So the best of both worlds. One (semi) regret is deciding not to splash out and take a water taxi from the airport. Not only does the waterbus take a long time, but the Europa, like many canal hotels, has its own grand water entrance on the Grand Canal, which is a much more glamorous way to arrive that wheeling suitcases down a dark alley. Obviously different rules apply in Venice when it comes to hotels, you pay a lot for less than you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d get pretty much anywhere in the world and if you take this into account, then the Europa comes recommended. Its hard to find a better located hotel in Venice. That said, personally I certainly wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac500 or \u00e2\u201a\u00ac600 rack rate in the summer, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d definitely consider going back in the winter when the comparatively quiet streets, fog and cold weather make Venice a really romantic destination.", "Date": "April 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cA wonderful hotel in a beautiful location\u201d", "Author": "Jacktor31623", "ReviewID": "UR28021745", "Content": "Our stay at The Westin Europa and Regina was extremely satisfying.

If you are navigating the narrow streets of Venice for the first time, the hotel can be somewhat tricky to find. But all you need to do is pop into a local business or hotel and kindly ask for directions to the Europa and Regina.

The staff there was very friendly and the bar offers a wide variety of drinks.

We reserved two rooms. One for my wife and I and another for my two boys (11 and 15). The hotel accomodated our request for adjoining rooms. In our opinion the hotel was in an excellent location right along the beginning (or end depending how you are going) of the Grand Canal. In terms of rates we thought we did OK because Starwood was running a special - pay for two nights get the third free. Our room rate also included the sumptuous buffet breakfast (57 euros per person per day). It had everything you could want and more. Utilizing this promotion we thought the hotel was a good value. It is important to remember that you are paying a good deal for Grand Canal frontage, as you do with all the hotels that front on the canal. The rooms were large and well appointed. The bathrooms had both a stall shower and a tub and were also large. The bathrooms were marble, floor to ceiling. A few rooms front on the Grand Canal. We had a side view of the canal off a small balcony which was very nice. As stated we found the hotel location very good and only a few blocks from St. Marx square, many restaurants, Harrys Bar, a vaporetto stop and great shopping. Other than breakfast we did not eat in the hotel. Generally, the Concierge Staff was friendly and polite, except for a short fellow (the hotel will know who I am referring to as they read this site often) who seemed to not want to be bothered and was generally unfriendly. It may be that he was uncomfortable speaking english, however, with so many Americans and Brits staying as guests this was surprising. We simply waited until someone else could help us. The night we arrived was unseasonably warm. No air conditioning was available because the hotel had not turned it on yet. Unfortunately, when we first inquired about it that evening, we were NOT told that it was not available yet and to the contrary were told that someone would be by to fix it. It was not until the morning that we learned that it was yet \"turned on\" for the season. The weather was beautiful the remainder of our stay and no A/C was needed. The remainder of the hotel was very nice, however, keep in mind it is made up of 5 different buildings so is somewhat fragmented. The salon on the first floor was very nice and it was great to eat breakfast every morning immediately on the Grand Canal looking at the traffic. The beds were very comfortable and I would describe the rooms as clean. Some construction was going on at one of the 5 buildings but it did not bother us at all. I suspect that this will be going on for some time. Only one minor mishap. We arrived back at the hotel from a day of sightseeing and found my kids room door ajar so that someone could walk right in. Fortunately nothing was taken. When we notified the front desk they responded quickly but did not seem to be as concerned as we were.

I booked a very good deal; otherwise i would not have chosen to stay at this hotel because it is so overpriced for what you get (even in the low season). I was upgraded to a nicer room than i had booked which was really the only positive thing I have to say about this hotel. The beds are definitely not \"heavenly beds\" and the rooms need a lot of upgrades, however, the bathroom was nice. The staff is rude and unless you are dripping with money, and they aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t willing to help you. The hotel was definitely not fully booked but the staff seemed bothered by anything you asked of them. One concierge wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give me the public waterbus schedule for an early flight I had because \"he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to be wrong and be the one responsible for me missing my flight\". i have never encountered a concierge that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have schedules for the local transportation or isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t willing to find out for a hotel guest. When I asked about private transportation to the airport, he quoted me a higher price than the concierge did the morning I left. He also quoted me the incorrect prices for the internet. After my first day of sightseeing, I came back to a room that was half cleaned. The bed wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t made, the dirty glasses weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t taken away and I had no new towels. The maid had only come in and taken the dirty towels but hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t done anything else. This was at 3 PM. When I told the front desk about this, they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t apologize and acted like this was normal and the maids come around in 2 shifts.

The room next to me was clearly smoking and it was a non-smoking wing, however, the hotel staff didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do anything about it and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t try to get rid of the smell.

Venice isn't my favorite place in the world, partly because it's one of the most expensive and partly because it's impossible to find one square centimeter of it that isn't a tourist trap...but everyone should visit Venice at least once. There's only one way to do Venice right, and that's to actually stay in the city, because it's much, much nicer after the daytrippers leave at night . Stay for at least three nights. We did two, and came up a little short on what we wanted to do and see. Once you've reconciled yourself to the cost, it goes back to my dad's saying \"for a nickel more, you go first class\". So we splurged on the Europa. We got a room with two tiny balconies hanging over the grand canal, looking across at Santa Maria De La Salute, or just \"Salute\". The view alone was worth the price of the room. Waking up in the foggy dawn and standing out on the balcony, watching one gondolier \"gondola-pool\" a boatload of his buddies to their gondolas to prepare them for the day, private speedboats and taxis zipping around, the water bus passing by, and barges of food and other goods drifting up the canal was probably the best experience of all. If you stay in Venice, stay on the Grand Canal, and make sure you have a window, if not a balcony, over the canal. The only thing that would have made it better would have been a steaming mug of coffee...but of course you don't drink coffee in Venice, you drink espresso. And calling room service for a $$$ doppio would have been ridiculous. We didn't eat at the hotel restaraunt, so I can't comment on it, other than to say that the location is prime, with the terrace having pretty much the same view as our room, only from water level. You'll get lost trying to find the exit if you arrived by water taxi. The hotel sprawls over about four different buildings, and the ground floor is a maze. The exit, we eventually discovered (too embarrased to ask), is to the right of the front desk. As you leave, bear to the right to get to San Marco, and to the left to get to relatively less touristy areas. You can engage a gondola about 50 meters from the exit at the first bridge that you'd cross to reach the square. The furniture was top-notch, the bed extremely comfortable, the bathroom fixtures perfect, there is really nothing I would improve about the room. Given that it was October, I can't comment on the efficiency of the climate control system. The staff were extremely helpful when approached, and did not intrude otherwise. This is one of the hotels that has the room key on a hefty fob to encourage you to leave the key at the desk when you go out...could have something to do with the pickpockets that San Marco is so famous for? Oh, one more thing. The streets near the hotel, at least in the direction of San Marco, are full of street vendors hawking counterfeit luxury goods after about 8PM. Kind of annoying, and from what I hear, YOU are the one who risks getting heavilly fined by the police, not the vendor, if you buy the knockoffs. If expense weren't a factor, I'd stay in the same room every time I visit Venice (assuming I came back to Venice). I highly recommend the Europa (by the way, skip the long name, the locals just call it the Europa, as did a Brit that I met on the train, and he hadn't even stayed there before, just knew of the hotel)!", "Date": "January 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, great hotel\u201d", "Author": "travLer2009", "ReviewID": "UR23142545", "Content": "We were only here for a night, but we had an enjoyable stay at this hotel.

I booked a 12 night cruise with Celebrity Cruises for the 27th August. I flew to Venice on the 26th as there was no flight on the 27th from Leeds/Bradford. I booked the Westin hotel based on the reviews on Trip Advisor. I made the booking with Travel Republic as the price was the most favourable and included full breakfast. This was my 4th visit to Venice and it is a city that I absolutely love. The Westin Europa Regina Hotel is within the pedestrian area of the city Due to the proximity of the Hotel the only way to arrive with the least inconvenience is by Water Taxi. Taking the public water transport would leave me at St Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Square and not really suitable as this would involve pulling bags over cobbled street and alley to reach the hotel entrance. The journey took about 30 minutes. I walked the short distance to where the water taxi terminal was and was immediately assisted with bags etc and we were off. It is in my opinion a wonderful way to arrive in Venice. Felt a bit like a Bond Movie as we were fairly zipping along! The taxi fare was 95 euro and this was clearly marked on the taxi jetty. On arrival at the hotel jetty we were met by 2 people who dealt with the baggage and a hotel Receptionist who escorted me to the check in desk. As I walked from the hotel jetty to the Reception I noted the grandeur of the hotel and it certainly was very impressive. The check in completed I was escorted to my room. I was taken aback by the size of the room it was very small and had expected more from what I had paid. I noted from the Trip Advisor that many guests stayed here with Starwood points but as we had paid a lot of money I felt that this was a bit of a let down. Yes the hotel was beautiful but I was going to spend the night in a less than impressive room. I called down to the desk and was told they would call me back. After some time and being anxious to get out and around Venice I went to the Reception and once again told them of my disappointment. I was told to call back later and to speak to the Receptionist on duty. I went out for some time to drink in the atmosphere of this truly wonderul city On my return to the Hotel I were told that They would offer me an upgraded my room. I asked to look at the room before I accepted the offer. This room was large with double aspect windows and a wonderful view of the Canal. It had a view of San Marco and so was delighted to move to this beautiful room. This large room had painted furniture and the walls were lined with a pale blue striped silk. There was a huge bed and a very large TV. The bathrooms are marble with a shower over the bath. The shower had a twin head and there had a very good pressure. The carpets were a little worn in all areas but this did not detract from my overall impression of the hotel. My booking included breakfast which if not included cost 50 euros. There was an excellent buffet which included fresh orange juice as well as many others, several smoothies. Many types of fresh fruit, cereals, cheeses, ham, smoked salmon, etc. There was also a hot plate with the usual bacon sausages egg etc. There was a great variety of breads cakes pastries etc. I ate breakfast on the terrace restaurant which is right on the canal side. It was wonderful to sit here and watch the various boats on the canal. It is such a romantic city and I would encourage anyone to book a hotel on the canal side. There were many little birds around and they flitted on and off the tables as people left. I went to the buffet and my cups etc were all changed as the birds had been at my table. The staff were attentive and efficient both at the Reception, the Porters, Concierge and the Dining room staff.

I do agree with the other reviews that the food/alcohol is expensive (Venice is NOT cheap regardless of where you stay).

The Westin was the second of two hotels we stayed at while in this beautiful city. What can I say? We were simply blown away by this hotel. The staff, the service, the restaurant on the canal (the best part of the canal in my opinion, I might add), the fact that we were actually taken to our room when we were checked in by the front desk clerk to see if we approved, the sparkling wine and hand made sweets on the first night's turndown, the note from the manager wishing us a wonderful stay...ok, I could go on, you get the point, it was fantastic. The room was in a word: stunning. Since this is an ancient building (like most in Venice) it has been renovated but the old-world charm remains. I personally like more modern hotels myself, but I have to say this hotel was the exception. From the Murano glass chandelier in our room to the plush sky blue material on the walls, to the old, tall balcony doors (three of them) opening directly onto the canal, the place was a dream. We paid about $500 for this room through Expedia BUT I am positive that was some kind of deal because it's worth 3 times that. I would advise that if you are in Venice for your honeymoon or any other special occasion - try to get a room on the canal for at least part of your stay. It makes the city so much more memorable. It's a very good idea to let the hotel know in advance if you are coming for your honeymoon, etc - they really go out of their way to make you feel special.

I have have traveled a great deal on business in my 30 year career and have a good sense for travel expectations. First , Venice is a wonderful place to visit. Many opportunities to see and enjoy this delightful city. One of the more expensive places I have travel to but for a few days well worth the trip. The Westin Hotel was selected after reading many on line trip reports for many hotels, primaraly for it's location and preceived four star rating. We took a private boat from the airport to the hotel for 90 Euros. There is a desk outside baggage at the airport that you can walk up to and book one for immediate departure to the hotel dock. The trip is about 20 minutes across the open water.... Following check in we we taken to our room on the fifth flloor with a \"panaramic view\" the view consisted of a water view across a side alley to the canal. Not great but OK. I quickly noticed that the room was warm...Was told that the hotel system is old and the room will cool in time. We unpacked and closed the drapes and lightsand went out to view the city. Returning 4 hours later the room did cool down a bit but was still warm. Since we havd unpacked we dicided to keep the room since the entire hotel is on the same air conditining system and the forced air was very very weak. The room had nice but very old furnishings and the carpet was worn and ripped from wear by the closet. The bath was large but the shower was very small and the water did not drain well creating a pool of water at your feet during use. The bigist issue we had was using my starwood points to cover the breakfast . For 1500 points would cover breatkast for the cost 104 Euros. We used this system the first day and decided to do the same on day two of our stay. I was told I did not have enought points to cover the second day when I knew I did and after much discussion and my showing the m documentation about my point total they admitted to over charging my starwood account by four times! Not that that was enough when we were checking out they charged me 104 Euros for the second days breakfast on my hotel bill. We did get it corrected but the attitude was one of indifference. As if I was putting them out of their way to correct their billing errors. By the way..if you order a drink be prepared to be charged alot...I oreded a standeded 7 and 7 (wiskey and ginger ale) and was billed 15 euros for the wiskey and another 6 euros for the ginger ale for a total of 21 euros plus a 10 % VAT which is about $35 US dollars....I shouold have ordered wine! Finally, when we were ready to leave I requested a bellman to take our baggage down from the room so we could meet our transportation at the dock. After 15 minutes we decided to do it ourselves since they did not show. This hotel is in a great location to St. Marks Square but I honestly would look at other options for the cost .

We found the concierge very helpful and all staff extremely obliging. We were greeted well by the reception staff. We would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again if we were to visit Venice again. DO NOT take a map, Venice is smaller than you think and the best part is just seeing where your feet take you. We struggled to find somewhere to eat but would recommend eating / drinking at the 'Bacaro' lounge, which is on the same street as Prada etc that you walked past to get to the hotel. It was modern and contemporary, good food, great atmosphere and great service. We also treated ourselves to a drink at Harrys Bar - it is very expensive....go if you feel the need to say that you have experienced Harrys Bar but there are better bars with more atmosphere.", "Date": "August 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Hotel\u201d", "Author": "CosSwitzerland", "ReviewID": "UR18490181", "Content": "We stayed at the Westin in Venice for 5 nights this past July. We booked directly through Starwood website. Following what others recommended, we booked a private water taxi through the hotel for our arrival and I will echo the recommendations of the others in saying Do it! It is a magical and wonderful way to arrive in Venice. We booked the arrival through the hotel which was 180 euros (it includes being greeted at the airport by a hostess, a private transfer to the docks and the water taxi to the hotel) but for the return to the airport we took a private water taxi which the concierge booked for us for 95 euros. A terrific way to arrive and takes the sting out of having to leave Venice! The check in procedure took a very long time and we were just hanging around waiting behind a mass of people at the front desk, felt that this was disorganized. We were given room 256, described on the website as a grand deluxe dream room with a view of the Grand Canal, in the Regina side, in my view the best side as the view from that side of the hotel was of the Church of Salute. In fact lying on the bed I could see the church, the tourists milling around the steps of the Church. I threw open the windows and heard O Sole Mio being belted out by a singer on the gondolas...the water lapping against the docks...It was truly the perfect room. The bed was in fact heavenly and the slippers and bathrobes top notch. We were given champagne and fruit jelly candies on arrival. (The jelly candies made an appearance each night on our bed). The bathroom itself was marble and new. Mirrors on all sides. There was a bath tub and a separate shower. The shower stall was a bit squeezed...just don't drop any soap! There is no room to bend down to pick it up. The complimentary shampoo and conditioner was not great, so the ladies may want to bring their own. The body lotion was wonderful. The view being so great I would have liked to keep the windows open but in July there were mosquitos. The first night I got bitten in three places. Luckily I had brought the anti mosquito tablets that you stick in the electric socket. This and the fact that we kept the windows closed in the evenings seems to have done the trick. I would recommend booking a room with breakfast. The area is near San Marco and full of tourist traps, I think it would have been difficult for us to walk out and find a place for breakfast before having any coffee each morning. The buffet is 52 euros which seems alot but if you went for the A la carte breakfast menu, you could easily reach that if you wanted, OJ, eggs, toast and fruit. The buffet was a huge spread with plum, tomato, OJ, apple, grapefruit juice further there was mango, banana and strawberry smoothies. Breads, toast, tarts, cereals, eggs, bacon, sausages, grilled tomatos (these were fantastic by the way) and home fries. There were cold cuts, smoked salmon and a cheese trolley. You could also order buttermilk pancakes as part of the buffet or a three egg omelette to order. Breakfast is until a welcome 11am. We didn't need to eat lunch due to the extensive breakfast each morning. The location of the hotel is perfect. We ended up walking everywhere and only took the vaporetto twice, once to go to Murano on our own and once to go out for dinner on the Dorsoduro side. The location, next door basically to San Marco meant that after a half day of sight seeing (Doge's Palace, the Campanile, Bridge of Sighs...) you could easily swing by the hotel for a refreshing shower and a little nap before getting on with the rest of your day. After dinner you can grab a gelato on your way home! The only negative thing I can say is that the entire concierge team, in general was unhelpful. I asked about Murano and he told me that the best thing was to go on a free factory tour although my question was how do I get there? I asked about the Secret Itineraries tour and his reply was come tomorrow and we will call them to see. I replied I wanted to see if I can do it today and he said that you cannot book the same day...so how does going tomorrow to book make any sense? It seemed to me as if they just put things off. I understand that there are many tourists asking the same questions. Maybe they could do a FAQ sheet for the guests... Finally, I had a guidebook from 2006 (Lonely Planet) I don't know when it was researched but the prices have pretty much doubled since then... I would recommend this hotel highly. It is expensive but for us it was definetly worth it!", "Date": "August 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cranford, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cBeware Booking with SPG Points\u201d", "Author": "zadar", "ReviewID": "UR18454617", "Content": "I was completely disappointed with the Westin.

We particularly liked that we were less than a 5 minute walk to St Marks Square, and the walk took us past the top European Designer boutiques including Prada, Gucci, Cavali, Feragamo and more. Not a bad walk! The hotel had its own water taxi stand, but except for our arrival we never used this very expensive form of transportation. We bought a 3 day Vaporetta pass and learned to enjoy the far less expensive \"water bus\" to get everywhere we wanted to go. The stop was a quick 3 minute walk from the Westin, located near the St Marks Royal Gardens. The hotel had a classic architecture and the room was very large for European standards. We liked the padded fabric covered walls and marble clad bathroom, as well as 32\" flat screen TV (although there were only a couple of English channels). If breakfast is not included in yoyr rate, walk to a near by cafe to avoid spending more than $90 on breakfast in the hotel. A word of advice: skip the temptation to book a canal front room. We spent $200 a night extra for this view and quickly learned that after spending every moment on the canals or looking at them, the last thing we cared about was looking at it some more through our window. Since most Venice hotels don't have balconies, you will only be paying for a window view - truly not worth it. Trust me and save the money. Except for the moment that you first arrive and look out the window, you'll never even care about the view. Service was personal and truly top notch and the staff at the front desk remembered us when we walked by.

The prices are high everywhere and this hotel is no exception.

The restaurant overlooks the Grand canal and having breakfast (52 Euros for the full buffet breakfast - and no that's not a typo its five two) watching early morning Venice go about its work is wonderful. Our package included breakfast - I'd recommend yours does as well. The buffet is reasonable. Nothing special but adequate. The bar is very pleasant with a deck area overlooking the canal (its adjacent to the restaurant) and to finish the evening with a glass of wine (only 8 Euros = good value considering prices elsewhere and location) looking out over the canal is, again, one of life's better experiences. So the location is wonderful. Is it hard to find? Answer not really if you have directions. We used the standard water taxi from the railway station to the St Marco (adjacent to the spot as the public water bus from the airport drops off) and found the hotel with ease following the directions. The only word of caution is that in the ~250m walk there is a bridge (one of the very many in Venice) you need to carry your luggage over. Its about 10-15 steps up and then down. We used the water bus back to the airport. Its highly recommend as you get a free tour of the outlying islands en route. It takes about 1hr 15 mins and costs 12 euro per head. Service was perfunctionary. I think that reflects Venice as a whole. There are so many tourists no-one has to try too hard. Hotel has a decent gym (didn't use it). Internet connection in room - again didn't use it. Room was OK. Unfortunately we had two single beds pushed together but didn't complain and managed. Everything else as expected.

After a difficult day of travel, it was nice to arrive to a beautiful hotel with professional, warm staff and clean rooms. Our first room was partially overlooking the grand canal on the Europa side, but was on the first floor directly overhead the piano bar. The noise level did not work for our family needs (but would have been fine if you were out for dinner at that time). The staff accomodated our move to a different floor quickly and efficiently, and also offered us a complimentary breakfast for our troubles. The breakfast was very expensive (52 euros!) considering what it was, and I would not pay to go there. Since it was free, we did take advantage of it. There was plenty of fresh fruit and juices, scrambled eggs, meats, cold cuts and cheeses, breads, etc. There was also a small kids buffet that would have been great for an older child (3 or 4 and up). We found that asking the concierge for restaurant recommendations was the best way to go in terms of finding affordable, delicious food in Venice. We were pointed towards several good restaurants that were much better than the ones in our guidebook, most within 10-20 minutes walking. The concierge were also excellent at answering a variety of questions and directing you. The hotel is in an excellent location to a variety of sights, but it is in a touristy neighborhood. We did use the free boat to Murano, and while the free water taxi to and from the glass factory was fun, we found the intense sales pitch and lack of tour on the topic of Murano glass to be disappointing. If we had to do it again we would have just taken a vaporetto over and explored on our own. We stayed there with our two year old and they provided us with a portable crib. This was longer than a standard pack and play and had side walls that were mesh and a \"headboard\" and \"footboard\" that were fabric. While it was fine for our toddler, and I wouldn't want to lug a pack and play to Europe, I would have been slightly concerned about putting a younger child in it as our daughter rolled into the mesh and I would be fearful that a smaller baby could get stuck there. I am also not sure how firm the mattress was, as I didn't check and it was made up with sheets and a pillow for our daughter. Also, my daughter kept bumping her head into the metal bars at the top - the fabric was not padded.

We chosse to take a private water taxi from the airport to the hotel, this in my opinion is the only way to arrive and depart, its costly if there are just 2 of you, at 90 euros each way, however the taxi can accommodate up to 8 guests and as the hotel has its own dock its simply a must. Some guests have commented on how difficult the hotel is to find if you arrive by Vaperetto ( public water bus) if you follow the hotels instructions it realy isnt that difficult although a suitcase with wheels is a must as its a 10 min walk and you do have 2 small bridges with steps to cross, the downside of using the Vaperetto is that they are busy and can take over an hour to reach San Marco ( nearest stop to hotel), the private taxi gets you there within 30 mins and is obviously just for your use. When we arrived at the hotel our luggage was taken from the taxi into the foyer and then arrived just after us in our room. We had a deluxe room in the original part of the hotel overlooking the canal. The room was almost a junior suite in size, plesantly furnished in a Venitian style. The bathroom was an all marble affair and had both a bath and seperate shower, it had just one sink and a bidet and wasnt overly large but had character and certainly served its purpose. The view from our room over the canal was great although the buildings opposite including the famous Basilica S. Maria Della Salute were under going restoration so were covered in scaffolding which was a shame. The hotel is made up of 4/5 diffrent adjoining buildings, the foyer and room type you see on the hotels website are situated in the original part of the hotel, you will also find the reception, main bar with its canal terrace in this part of the hotel together with the Grand Salon which is a very ornate drawing/sitting room, the main restaurant is situated in an adjoining building although each building is connected so they tend to blend into each other. We found the front desk staff and the Duty Manager friendly as were the concierge team, the restaurant staff im afraid were indiffrent and at breakfast if you dint ask you didnt get. Breakfast was in fact a huge disappointment, not only was the quality and choice of food poor the buffet was priced at 52 euros per person, I am very well travelled and have stayed in some of the finest hotels in the world and never have i seen a breakfast so expensive. They even charged 5 euros for 1 piece of thinly sliced toast and coffee is around 6.50 euros, the tip here is if possible get your breakfast included in your room rate, otherwise just for the basics you will be spending 50 plus euros a day per couple. Whilst in Venice we visited a few other Hotels and even the famous Gritti Palace and The Daniele have a faded elegance about them. If its high tech luxury in modern rooms with excellent levels of service for a fair price, Venice isnt the place for you. The city and its high end hotels may have character and a certain charm but we found staff have mixed attitudes and the outrageous cost of accommodation, food and drink almost everywhere in the city bears no relation to what you actualy get. Our visit was as a Birthday treat for my partner, we had realised that we would be in Venice when the Carnival ended, I hadnt thought this a problem until we arrived to find enough people to sink the place. Getting around and sightseeing were almost impossible. You could not see St Mark's Square for people let alone the amazing architecture around it, our timing was bad, however after the last day of Carnival we almost had the place to ourselves the contrast couldnt have been more different. A drink or ice cream at a cafe in St Marks square is a must, however be prepared to pay a 5 euro cover per table to go towards the orchestra if they are playing.Our 2 cappucinos and 2 limon ice creams came to just under 50 euros, like everything else its far from cheap. That said just off the square there are some pizza/pasta restaurants that are much more reasonable, no frills and quickly cooked food for around 12 euros per head. Not far from the Europa & Regina is a restaurant called The Caravella it forms part of a Hotel and fronts onto Calle Larga XXII Marzo almost opposite Gucci. Be warned this has to be the worst place i have ever eaten a meal, the staff are pompous and the decor resembles a mix between a run down English countryside pub meets the inside of an old naval war ship, not good. The food is not just expensive, 36 euros for a main course, but poor quality and badly cooked, our main meal was so small we had to fill ourselves with the contents of the bread basket. The Europa & Regina is in a good position close to San Marco square and the surrounding designer shops. The cost of a room is about average for Venice, if possible pay for a Canal View and try and get your breakfast included in your room rate, otherwise budget another 50 plus euros a night. Room service food and drinks are expensive as are drinks from the bar, however it appeared to be the same everywhere and after all its a 5* hotel in an expensive European city. Private water taxi is a must otherwise follow the hotels directions exactly and be prepared for a bit of pushing and shoving on the public water bus. I would also add that when its busy you may not get on the first water bus and therefore would have to wait another 30 mins for the next to arrive. Remember that even when the sun is out in the colder months the crossing from the airport to the city, however you do it can be a chilly one so wrap up warm. Be prepared at busy times for large crowds, expect everything to be expensive, make sure you have plenty of euros or credit cards with you and just enjoy Venice for what it is. If you take the trip to Murano to vist the glass factories be warned they will show you their most expensive pieces of work first( most start from 500 euros) and then if your pockets arent deep enough as a last resort you will be shown the 'tourist' shop that sells much more affordable items from 5 euros up to 2000 euros. We found that the choice of glassware was as good if not better actualy in the city, you can negotiate with the retailers on price and in my opinion get a good deal.

We have stayed at many Westin and Starwood properties before getting Westin Europa in Venice. Our expectation was even higher due to $$$$ price tag per night, but how many times do you get to go to Venice \"for the first time\"? We booked our room through a consolidator and got a pretty good deal. We were told Italians come to Venice in Sept. when tourists leave. Contrary to some reviewers, it wasn't difficult to find this hotel. But it seems very easy to miss it all together. Once you get off the crowded water taxi, just follow your eyes from one Italian designer store to next, until you get to Bottega Venetta and turn left. If you see Gucci, you went to far (or was it Prada?). Check in was easy, though I am used to faster check in service. We had to pay extra money for a roll away for our daughter. I grumbled at this but, again we are getting used to European hotels. We loved the view from our hotel. Imagine seeing Grand Canal of Venice with taxi boats, gondolas... framed by two buildings on either side of Westin. Overall our room was roomy (wow) and comfortable. Even the rollaway was comfy, according to our daughter. The location of this hotel is awesome. It's a short walk to the St Mark's Square. A nice comfortable, roomy, gorgeous, clean hotel that we'll use again when we go back to Venice. This was an above average hotel for me.

The reception team was professional, but not overly gregarious. We had a standard room, that was decorated with standard venetian flair. If we were to stay here again, I would definately opt for an upgraded room, as the room did not reflect the bearing of the lobby. The furnishings were showing signs of wear, the carpet had a iron burn spot, and there was a definate need for attention to details in the repainting of trims and moldings. The first evening our room was equipped with 2 robes, but the next day, 1 robe was removed from the room. I requested a replacement of the robe, and never received the replacement. Also, upon check-in to our room, we did not receive bath slippers, and wore slippers from another hotel. Upon our return to the room on the SECOND day, we received 2 pair of slippers. These are small things, but small things make the difference between 4 and 5 star experiences. **One nice touch is the mask for sell in the room - saves you the trouble of looking for one, if you so choose. Overall, there are many hotels to select from in Venice. I have stayed in 6 different locations with varying price ranges. I found this to be a standard (non-charismatic) experience.

I was concerned about location because I had heard how expensive private taxis were. In fact the Concierge will get you a very expensive private taxi. I suspect they are getting a cut back. We chose to take the public water taxi after taking the bus to the stop at the top of the Grand Canal. We did not find the walk to the hotel difficult except that just before you turn left to the hotel walkway, there is a bridge we had to lug our luggage over. If you don't have roller luggage to get that far you may want to buy some. We had booked a partial canal view. The best part of the Canal view - the Church had scaffolding all over it. So the view was not as spectacular as it could have been. We had heard to request the older section which is closest to the front desk called \"Casa Tiepolo wing\". Also a prior post said 249 was a good room. We stayed in 107 in the Casa Tiepolo wing and liked our partial canal view. I forgot to ask if there was an upgrade suite in the newer section. I am glad I did not because this room had an elegant old world look with great marble and other amenities. A prior post had said room 415 was bad. As you may have heard from Samantha Brown on the travel channel when she was there, this hotel is the merger of 5 hotels over time. The breakfast was too expensive as we had heard. 50 Euro for an IHOP breakfast menu didn't seem worth it. No one seems to offer breakfast at non-hotel restaurants in Italy. All I can say is plan ahead or pay the ridiculous price or pack cereal. The best service we got was a free water taxi to a Murano Glass furnace. The glass factories pay for you in hopes you will buy glass from them. Marco the owner gave us a personal tour starting at the furnace. This factory specialized in Chandeliers and Mirrors. They had lots of other artists in their store. After our tour and after going through the gift shop we asked for where else we should go. He said the church and the Glass Museum. He didn't want us to go to other factories. We were not interested in any of their glass and ended up buying a few small items there and then went on to find our way to other places. He told us to be back by 4 pm to get a taxi back. I wish we had taken the public taxi back so we could stay longer. We did go to a large factory called Formia which has 50 glass blowers and does nice, but not as complicated work. We bought a nice glass piece from Formia. Back to the hotel - it has a nice restaurant on the canal (see attached photo). Although we did not eat there the view was great. I was not sure if we would like Venice and it turned out to be our favorite city for all of our Europe trip. We only stayed one night but had almost 2 full days in Venice - Murano. We would have stayed another night at this hotel and would recommend it to others. We did have a bad restaurant experience at Trattoria GiGi (not at the hotel) which is somewhat close to St. Marks Square. It looked nice and quaint but was terrible. I will never eat at a restaurant that several people here or Frommers, or Rick Steves or Zagat have recommended. The sitting room in this hotel is very elegant. The inside bar by the canal is very cozy and elegant. There is nice glass pieces in the hallway in display cases. There was a nice glass piece outside our room on the way to the stairs as well. This hotel is close to shopping. The gondoliers are right along the path about 50 yards from the entrance to the hotel. St. Marks square is close by as well. I would not spend less than 3 days in Venice - Murano when I go again. My wife bought a silk scarf for a good price. She also bought clothes at a shop close to St. Marks Square that was not a big noticeable name but was reasonably priced. If you must pay more, the big names are in the area as well, including Valentino, Versace and Prada. A very nice touch was a mask in our room that had a lot of character. It was next to the Mini Bar and was ~30 Euro so we bought it. It looked better than many we saw around Venice. Just across the canal is the Guggenheim Museum. It is interesting outside and inside. I would trade more time for not going if I had a choice. If you are taking a private taxi to and from the airport you need to at least take a taxi or public taxi all the way up the Grand Canal. The gondoliers simply won't go that far and it would take them too long. Whatever you do, plan your time wisely and enjoy the Elegance of Venice. The staff was polite and accommodate a 4 pm checkout consistent with my SPG gold status, and they were happy to hold our bags after we checked out to that we could do more before a late flight. We took the orange bus to and from the airport and feel now that I should have paid a little more and go on the blue bus.

This trip to Italy was our reward to ourselves for all the nights spent away from home on business. We took the water taxi to the hotel from the airport. It's an expensive means of transport (100 euros) but we heard it could be difficult to find the hotel from Piazza San Marco the first time and we had been up 24 hours at this point. It saved us 30-60 minutes as it went directly to the hotel. The hotel itself was lovely.The room was large with the signature heavenly bed and a flat screen tv.

We had 2 problems with the room - hot water wasn't working in the shower only and one light wasn't working properly. We called and someone came up immediately and the problems were both fixed within minutes. We used the concierge service to make a restaurant reservation for us and they did so. We didn't deal much with the concierge or front desk staff but they were professional, knowledgeable and friendly when we did deal with them.

It was pricey at almost u$s 1,000 per night. I've stayed in some amazing hotels before but really I found this to be the best place I ever stayed considering the amazing view of the canal from our room! At the check-in they said the room wasn't ready yet but they told me that based on their availability and considering my past business with the hotel chain they were providing an upgrade to me. To an even bigger room still with a Canal View. I'm not sure what the rate is on this room but their website shows 1,500 EUROS per night. We went to go out and they stored our bags for us and they told us to come back at 2 PM. I asked the concierge a good place to eat. Really the entire staff was always great and friendly. I used the concierge a lot throughout my stay to get friendly tips on good restaurants and they were always spot on and most of the times they made the reservations for us and that ensured us great service when we got to the restaurants sometimes with the owner of the restaurants greeting us. The room was incredible! The view was breathtaking. I'll attach some photos of the view from my room that I took. The ceilings were really high (probably 15 foot ceilings) and the room was very big with a living room as well. The bathroom was big and all marble. Talk about old world charm! The room had 3 huge windows with a balcony stretching across the room. From the outside we could see it took up the entire front of the building so we had the entire floor view it seems. The bathroom had a separate shower stall (a bit small but worked great with great pressure and hot water) and a bathtub as well. The room had heavy curtains and black out blinds to block out the sun and it was VERY quiet. The staff throughout the stay was really great. One day it rained and they came up and brought us up a nice umbrella to use during our stay. Everyone was great and I can't say enough great things about it. I'd recommend a Canal View room if you can afford it. The room also had a big LCD tv with a pretty extensive cable package. We watched a bit of TV late at night as we are night owls. Also, there was high speed internet connection (not wireless) and it was 12 Euros per day. It works flawlessly and they billed it to our room. Really a great stay in a true 5 star hotel.", "Date": "November 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cSimply Fabulous\u201d", "Author": "Charles S", "ReviewID": "UR10385043", "Content": "My wife & I finished our first trip to Italy (two weeks; Rome, Positano, Florence, and Venice) by spending five nights at Westin Europa and Regina Venice. Disclosure: I used 48000 Starwood points for this stay, under Starwood Preferred Guests' \"Fifth Night Free\" points offer (redeem points for four nights, and the fifth night is free). In advance of our stay, I contacted the hotel directly, to advise them we would require a rollaway bed for the first two nights of our stay (my sister had flown over from the US to spend some time with my wife & me during our trip to Italy), and to make a dinner reservation at La Cusina for my wife's birthday on 19 October. I received an email reply acknowledging both requests, and was advised that there would be a 125 Euros per night surcharge for the rollaway bed (exorbitant I thought, but apparently standard in many hotels across Italy, if not Europe). Following our arrival at Venice Stazione, we took a private water taxi directly to Westin Europa and Regina (60 Euros, plus 10 Euro tip). Though there were no porters to assist us with our bags from the water taxi, we thought this just a minor inconvenience, as we were soon assisted when we entered the hotel. Check in was fast, friendly, and efficient, with our reservation being in order. The rollaway bed was in the room and made up when we entered, and a complimentary bottle of Prosecco was chilling in an ice bucket for us. Our luggage was delivered soon afterwards. Though we had no view of the Grand Canal from our room, I believe that we did receive an upgrade, as the room was extra spacious, with a separate dressing room, and very large bathroom, with dual basins. However, unlike our room at Westin Excelsior Rome, the shower was over the bath, not separate. Service was consistently exceptional for the duration of our stay, far exceeding our expectations (especially considering what we had read in several TripAdvisor reviews of this property). If ever we phoned to request extra towels, ice, turndown service, etc., the staff were at our door so quickly that we felt they must have been expecting our call. When I asked the concierge if there was a business centre where I could copy my digital photos onto a disk for my sister, I was told no, and then nicely offered directions to a camera shop that would do this for me. We asked the concierge for recommendations on restaurants, and the advice was always excellent: lunches at Trattoria Alla Madonna, and Paradiso, both located near Rialto Bridge, with Paradiso being the better of the two. Antico Martini (located relatively close to the hotel) was the first recommendation from the concierge for a place to go for lunch with Italian friends who were coming to visit from Rome for the day, and we thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience (the house special risotto with scampi and rocket was quite nice and very filling). My wife's birthday dinner at La Cusina was outstanding, though extremely expensive, but worth the experience. We were given a corner table by the window, with a view across the Grand Canal to Santa Maria della Salute. Service was friendly and attentive. One of the waiters even took my wife's mobile phone and charged it for her during our dinner (her charger had stopped working earlier in the trip). Though I had not requested one, a birthday cake with candles was brought out, with four of the staff singing \"Happy Birthday\" in perfect English. A lady at the table opposite was also celebrating a birthday, and a cake was brought out for her earlier, though the singing was in Italian. Here is where the Westin Europa and Regina Venice really went out of their way in terms of \"service\": Within five minutes of checking out of the hotel, I received an SMS from British Airways, advising that our 11:25AM flight to London Gatwick had been cancelled. We were subsequently booked on a flight scheduled to depart at 10:25PM that evening. I advised the front desk clerk, who then granted my request to have our room back until the 4:00PM checkout time available to Starwood Gold Preferred Guests. Before actually staying at Westin Europa and Regina Venice, I told my wife there was no way that I would ever pay \"real money\" to stay there, given the rates the hotel charges. However, after spending five wonderful nights at Westin Europa and Regina Venice, and having experienced the service they provide, I would now gladly book a paid stay at this property should my wife & I ever be fortunate enough to return to Venice, which I found to be the most interesting, fascinating, and unusual city I have ever visited. I find it difficult to understand how some people who have written reviews about Westin Europa and Regina Venice did not enjoy their stay at this property, or could find fault with the service provided by the staff at this hotel.", "Date": "October 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fair Oaks, California", "Title": "\u201cStay Away\u201d", "Author": "Dave1024", "ReviewID": "UR10186923", "Content": "Just got back from an 8 city European holiday which was great.

It is a convenient location for walking in Venice...close to the Piazza San Marco, but tucked away off the main street so it was quiet and away from throngs of tourists. That was the best thing about the hotel... once you entered it, it did not feel touristy. The hotel arranges taxis to Murano, Lido, and other islands. I wanted to visit La Fenice, the opera house that was closed on my previous visits to Venice. The concierge organized a personal guide for us who was a former manager of the opera house.

St. Mark's Square is just a 5 minute walk from the hotel, through picturesque streets filled with beautiful boutiques and famous designer shops. Our experience with this hotel was a great one. Thankfully, we did not let our apprehensiveness over the negative reviews get in the way and booked this hotel. Since we have travelled extensively during our 23 years of marriage we already know that people staying at the very same hotel, within the same category room, can have a very different experience. Your resolve to not let minor things ruin your overall great experience at this beautiful and well situated hotel can make a big difference as well. Rooms: We were travelling with my parents and had booked 2 Grand Deluxe full canal view rooms that were equally priced. However, since we are Starwood Elite members, our room was upgraded to a master grand canal corner suite (room 250) which had five full windows that offered fantastic canal views, 3 of them with small step out balconies. I have to admit that considering the USD710.00 rate we had paid for our originally booked room, this is what I had expected our room to be like before the upgrade. Had we not been upgraded and been assigned the \"Grand Deluxe full canal view room\" my parents had (room 254), I would have felt I was not getting good value for the rates charged. Their room was indeed beautifully furnished with Murano glass accents everywhere and a large lavish marble bathroom offering all of the luxuries promised. However, since their \"grand deluxe full canal view room\" was recessed from the left and right side of the building, it was smaller than the standard size (still large in European standards) and their \"full canal view\" was limited, not offering the same full canal views that any one window in our room did. Dining: I know this is Venice and that overall Venice is very expensive, and we have been to other cities that can be quite more expensive, but this hotel's restaurant breakfast rate is gastronomical in comparison to any other. In any instance, I believe that paying over USD100.00 for a few simple pastries/rolls & two coffees is not good value for your money. However, I must admit that the magnificent setting of the hotel's restaurant, which offers beautiful 180* views of the grand canal makes it worth having dinner there at least once during your stay. The dinner menu is a little limited, the portions are very small and everything is a la carte, but every entree we tried was very delicious. Definitely better value for your money at dinner. Venture off the Beaten Path: Since we were travelling with my parents, we did not have a chance this time to walk off the beaten tourist path and try some of the restaurants in the more inset areas, but I highly recommend you do so, if possible. The food is significantly more traditional and of good quality, but most important the portion size is more adequate for the prices you are paying. In addition, it is nice to get to see other areas that offer a more authentic perspective of Venice and that are not so populated with tourists. I have to admit I missed that during this trip. Overall: In all fairness, I have to say that our overall experience with the Westin Europa & Regina was a fantastic one.

The first (and best) is its location: directly onto the Grand Canal, opposite Santa Maria della Salute and at the point where the Canal opens out into the lagoon. Breakfast, drinks, lunch and dinner can be taken on the terraces overlooking the mesmerising activity of a busy day and night on Venice\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main highway.

Your window will provide you with the very best in entertainment, both humorous and dramatic. Your water taxi drops you off at the landing at the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfront\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of the hotel. And you can leave by the discrete door at the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcback\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that leads onto a peaceful square with ivy-clad walls. The overall serenity is surprising considering that you are just a five-minute walk past eye-watering expensive designer shops to the mayhem of the Piazza St Marco. The next important aspect is the staff. We found them all to be friendly, helpful and polite. Our Italian is limited to menus and the usual greetings but the concierges and waiters answered our enquiries and orders clearly, correctly and, always, with plenty of Italian charm. Food is a particularly personal matter but the breakfasts offered something for every appetite from fruit and yoghurt to scrambled eggs, sausages, saut\u00c3\u00a9 potatoes and fried tomatoes. All washed down with freshly squeezed juices, powerful coffee or iced prosecco. Obviously we also tried Venice\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tempting cafes and restaurants but lunch and dinner at the hotel was an amazing experience: tasty, thoughtfully prepared food served up with that unbeatable view.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure other similar hotels offer most of what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve described and some may be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccooler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in decoration and attitude but very, very few offer the best luxury in Venice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a front row seat on the Grand Canal.", "Date": "May 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cNice stay, but some issues...\u201d", "Author": "v102377", "ReviewID": "UR7486094", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Westin Europa & Regina from April 20, 2007 through April 23, 2007. We cashed in our Starwood points for a three night stay. We took the vaporetto (water bus) into Venice from the airport and got off at St. Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Square. It took us a little while to find the hotel because it was our first time in Venice and the streets were a bit confusing to navigate.

The Good: The hotel is lovely, but the best thing is its terrific location! Minutes to St. Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s square, wonderful shopping, and the Rialto bridge area. Both the room and the bathroom were a good size for European standards. Also very close to vaporetto stops, Accademia bridge, and many restaurants. The Not so Good: We also had problems with temperature in our room like the previous reviewers. We learned that the hotels in Venice do not turn on the ACs in guestrooms until June 1st. This was fine since it was quite cool outside and we would not have minded just having our windows open. However, there are no screens on the windows in the hotel and we had a huge problem with mosquitoes coming into our room, which was no surprise since Venice is surrounded by water. After waking up with numerous mosquito bites after the first night, we opted to leave the windows closed for the remainder of our stay which made the room extremely stuffy. Another thing that bothered me a bit was the numerous dirty spots on the wall covering. Not something you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect from a pricey hotel. Overall, we did like this hotel.

So it should be some indication that I am contributing this review of the Westin Regina & Europe, Venice. It has motivated me to warn others of very poor value! I read the reviews prior to going and thought, \"but it is a Westin..it can't be that bad.\" It was, as long as you are in the wrong part of the hotel. My major issue: Value for the money. I had a 50% off discount and still paid 352EUR per night Dec 27-30. OK, it is Venice and a 5 star property. But what about a 50EUR breakfast (200 EUR for our little family of 4?!) or a 125EUR per night roll away bed charge? Outrageous. I have stayed in numerous Luxury Collection locations with Starwood around Europe (including the fabulous Hotel Grande Bretagne in Athens) and never run into rates like this, at a Westin brand no less. But what disappointed me most is that, despite being \"upgraded\" to an Executive Room via my Gold SPG status, we walked into a room that was as \"tired\" as any I have stayed in over the past 5 years, and we have been a lot of places around the world. It was large and the bathroom was splendid, but the paint had marks all over each wall, the carpet was extremely worn, and I can't even begin to describe the chairs in the room - they had sags in the seats that would put the Grand Canyon to shame! I stay with Starwood extensively and have never had an issue with the quality of a Westin, until now. After 2 nights in that room (415), I asked the desk yet again if they had something nicer. A nice lady at the front desk showed me to two other rooms, one with a partial view and another \"Executive Room.\" These rooms, however, were in a newly (10 yrs ago) refurbished wing of the hotel (something I had asked about twice and been told, no, the entire hotel is the same age). It was SO MUCH nicer. It was quality we were initially expecting and we were very pleased with that room (room 110), complete with its own sitting room with couch and separate bedroom. Yes, it was a bit smaller, but the quality fo the room was so much better. My advice: if you can qualify for an complimentary upgrade, ensure you get an Executive Room, at a minimum. And ask for a room in the wing \"Casa Tiepolo.\" Otherwise, the location is superb - literally steps from an uncrowded Gondola location, a beautiful little church, all the brands (Prada, etc.) you could ever want, and maybe 400 meters from Piazza San Marco. VERY quiet. A water taxi from the Communale parking garage was 60EUR each way and drops you right at Westin's dock on the Canal Grande (don't park on the top level at Communale for visitors - try to push to get on a \"private\" deck lower down where there are more cameras, much more space, and less traffic - seems much more safe).

So we opened the window to let some cooler air in. The next morning we woke up with terrible mosquito bites. We called downstairs and told them about the problem, but they said there was nothing they could do, because they couldn't turn the AC on. They did send someone up with bug spray. The next two nights there we kept the windows closed and had a tough time sleeping because it was so muggy inside. With that said, I don't think these problems are unique to this hotel. We talked to others in Venice who had similar problems at their hotels. I think it's the nature of Venice. On the positive side, the buffet breakfast at the hotel was fantastic, as was the location. I also worked out in their workout room, and it was clean and well-equipped. Bottom line: We loved Venice, but not the hotel -- although we readily admit that it was probably still as nice as we could find in Venice.

We checked out the following morning. It's important to note that the other floors did not have the smell because we would walk down the 5 floors instead of using the elevator. Additionally, you have to enter the hotel from a side street, which had the feel of an alley. Mainly because it was very dark and empty.

We immediately requested a new room, and they moved us to a renovated room in the Europa portion of the hotel. This made a huge difference. This difference in room quality was made clear when we learned that this used to be two separate hotels until Westin purchased them and made them into one property. The rooms in Europa have been renovated, whereas the rooms in Regina have not, and they are clearly inferior. Our new room was a corner room, and though there still wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much of a view, at least it was more spacious and more importantly, it was clean.

The room had a balcony with seats and a table, try sipping some wine in the evening and watch the boats go by, go on it's what you have worked so hard for!

This was good with coffee to die for, this seems to be a trademark of Italian hotels. Dinner in the restaurant looked pricey but only to be expected in this kind of establishment.

I'm pretty flexible and always try to find the good things to highlight, but this to me is unsatisfactory. Maybe it was because we were in the \"Europa\" side and not the \"Regina\", however this is very unlike Starwood hotels. One good note though, the concierge, (the only one in the hotel that talked to us) followed us outside and asked if we would like him to set up any tours. The bar with the views of the grand canal (beautiful views) was unnecessarily expensive. I've traveled extensively throughout Europe and have no problem with spending, but 25 dollars for a long island iced tea is a little excessive. To add insult to injury, you can get a free ride to the island of Moreno for a glass tour, which the hotel has an agreement with a glass factory and is about 15-20 minutes away, but its 50 bucks to take you 10 minutes down the river to the train, so you are stuck lugging luggage through the narrow streets to the public transport. Typical tourist nickel and dime hotel. On a lighter note, the location was very convenient to the main sites. Venice is, and always will be magical, but still I'm very disappointed in the hotel:( (This is the worst review I've ever had to write)", "Date": "September 4, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alexandria, VA", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel, Great Location, Expensive!\u201d", "Author": "Leoned", "ReviewID": "UR3810934", "Content": "Stayed for three nights in August of 2005 using Starwood Award Points. As a Platinum member (I travel for work approx. 100 nights per year), we were upgraded to a suite overlooking the Grand Canal. The rooms are very modern and bathrooms are marble with a tub, separate shower, sink, toilet and bidet. The entire facility was recently updated and it screams \"first class\" in the bar, the restaurant, on the Grand Canal patio and in the rooms. The hotel has a very nice patio on the Grand Canal and there was live music each night to set the tone. It was a beautiful location and naturally the drinks were not cheap. 8 euro for a ginger ale, 8 euro for a beer, and 12 - 15 euro for a mixed drink and a club sandwich was 22 euro. Yes, very expensive but to be away from the crowds and to have one of the best views in Venice you can almost, ALMOST, rationallize the prices. The view across the Canal to the San Maria della Salute is the icing on the cake. The hotel is about a four minute walk to San Marco and very convenient to all of the central sites in Venice. The hotel staff was very helpful and professional.

Special note that since our stay during July is very hot (temperature wise). It is very good to have hotel close by and you can always go back for refreshment in your own air conditioning room. There are not many cafe or restaurant in Venice hv aircon. service - It's great. From check-in, pepole in the front desk always very polite to our request.

Concierge people also very nice to give any guidence. Food - very nice breakfast with fresh orange juice with variety of food. Not to mention good view rightby Grand Canal every morning. No wonder they charge EUR 50 per person for breakfast. We booked the room with breakfast include which seems a good deal Room - hv to said I am disappoint on this. I have been stayed dozen 5 star hotels and not to mention we have been upgrade to suite category. The room itself looks very shabby consider the decoration. Not exactly according to the web-site picture. But don't mistake the room itself very clean and comforable, heavenly bed truly good, and bath+shower room is very large and hv to said 'heavenly shower' very nice.

We had only one night to stay in Venice and accomodations are very expensive, so we opted to use our Starwood Points at the Westin Europa. The staff on arrival was very welcoming; we inquired to make sure we got a king size bed as requested. While they had assigned us a twin room, without a pause, they upgraded us to a junior suite on the top floor as the remaining room with a king bed. This room was small but beautiful with a terrace over the city that probably went for $700-1000 US per night. We were thrilled. The bed was super comfy and the bathroom marble with great amenities. Our only morning in Venice was started with the best coffee I've had in my life in the breakfast room right on the Grand Canal. The breakfast buffet appeared very basic for 30 or so Euros per person. We checked our bags for a day of sightseeing; the bellmen were helpful and friendly with our many questions. Note that this place is very hard to find on foot the first time, but once you get acclimated to the Venice layout, it's no problem. Be prepared to spend a lot and deal with Disneyland-type crowds at every turn. We will definitely return to Venice but off-season when we can enjoy it's charm better. We recommend the Westin if money is no object and you want American-style comfort that's hard to come by in an ancient city. This is no \"palace\" for the rates they charge; it is on par with places that charge about $300 per night in US cities. Definitely have a glass of wine at the patio at the bar one late evening -- the view of the canal and the basillica opposite the hotel at night is one you will never forget.", "Date": "July 3, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winston-Salem, NC", "Title": "\u201cDoesn't Get any Better than this...\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3616667", "Content": "WOW!

Our room was on the 6 and 1/2 (7th really but they don't call it that!) floor and overlooked the grand canal, santa croce and in the distance you could see Lido. Our balcony was huge about 5 by 20.

It helps to mention you're on your honeymoon-- people become very interested in offering advice and become very patient!

We even ordered an \"american\" breakfast (we missed bacon and eggs after about 4 days of pastries) and were very pleased.

The room was beautifully and tastefully decorated, oozing Venetian charm. The only qualm about the room was the bed; for Westin lovers out there, this bed is, unfortunately, not heavenly. Not a king but two twins joined together with a top sheet, the bed is a bit of disappointment (especially if the purpose of your visit is of a romantic nature). The hotel's public areas are grand and inviting, with the Tiepolo bar a great setting for an aperitivo (expensive albeit). The concierge was generally helpful, but the night staff was hit or miss. Leave your work at home though; internet access (not in the room) will cost you 8 euros for 30 minutes and 15 euros for an hour in the hotel's business center. The hotel's location is perfect, a three minute walk from the San Marco Vallaresso vaporetto (water subway) stop and right in the heart of all that is Venice. A water taxi from Piazzale Roma (the last bastion of cars/buses on the island of Venice) will cost you about 50 euros. Be prepared to spend your euros if you plan on dining in the hotel's restaurant; however, the concierge is very helpful in doling out recommendations for local, value-oriented restaurants (Trattoria all Madonna near the Rialto bridge a tested favorite).
