{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Loved every minute at the Genesio! Last month (September, '08) I had the pleasure of spending several days at the Genesio, my third stay in four years there. My experience at the Genesio has been good every time I have stayed there (which is, obviously, the reason I continue going there!), but the most recent stay was my most enjoyable. Simone was such a wonderful help, advising me and my travel companion on good, affordable restaurants, providing us with directions to various places in Florence that we wanted to see, which were well within walking distance of the Genesio. When we checked out, we felt like we were saying goodbye to a longtime friend! I originally stayed at the Genesio because the price was right, but if I suddenly came into big money, I would return to the Genesio for the warm atmosphere, my warm and helpful friend Simone, and the feeling of experiencing an authentic piece of Florence.", "Date": "Oct 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR593905284", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Pattirac"}, {"Content": "Florence, I love you! I stayed at Hotel Genesio for 4 nights whilst i explored this beautiful city. Remembering that a hotel is just a base whilst sightseeing I was more than adequately pleased.The rooms were clean and fresh towels daily. The hosts Simone  Leonardo were just delightful and more than helpful. Simone's knowledge of the city and all of its amazing art  sculpture was better than any guide book written.

Stayed at the Hotel Genesio for 4 nights, overall it was an ok experience but not great. It was clean with fresh towels every day but quite worn, we had holes in the walls and the bathroom was not great. In some areas of the hotel there was a smell of sewage. I went together with a large group and some of us had an extremely rude welcoming by one staff member.

Room was smallish and the shower a bit cramped by the WC. Very clean with fresh towels each day.Breakfast consisted of juice/tea/coffee and muesli or cornflakes.There were also pre-packed biscuits and bread rolls with all the usual jams etc. Quite adequate but I didn't particularly like the rolls!Hotel was quite handy for the markets and touristy places and about a 15 minute walk from the station. In the same street is a grocery convenience store and a couple of pizza places.There is a bar on the corner of the next block and a tobacconist opposite.The weather was very cold and windy but the room was very well heated.The hotel is on the second floor so would be difficult for disabled people as there is no available lift.Staff were all helpful and friendly and all in all this hotel is excellent value for money.

There were plenty of towels.Breakfast was not very exciting but satisfactory.The Genesio is within easy walking distance of the major sites in Florence.The staff were all helpful and friendly.We paid 70 euro per night for our twin room and on balance I regard that as excellent value.

The city isnt very big so even the farthest point is still walkable. The workers were sooooooooo nice! they helped us book train tickets and gave us directions everytime we needed them. The cleaning lady was the nicest of all the hotels i stayed in during my trip. The rooms have quality air conditioning and are pretty roomy except the bathrooms where your toilet is in the shower. the only bad thing was our bed had a board in the middle of it to hold it up.

The reception staff were very pleasant and helpful and spoke good English. Breakfast was well presented and adequate. The only downside was that the hotel was on the 2nd floor with no lift - 56 steps - but my father managed it !! Also the hotel was completely uncarpeted and therefore there was a high degree of noise at certain times.Very good value for a 2 star hotel.", "Date": "May 9, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR867120433",
