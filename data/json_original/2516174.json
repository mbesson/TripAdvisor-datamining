We were travelling with parents and wanted to stay within walking distance of shops and restaurants. The Inn met our needs well. It's not really a hotel since it has only limited facilities. Breakfast is delivered to your door from Sweetie Pies a lovely little coffee shop. Literally steps from the hotel lobby. The rooms are quaint and country. A little dated but comfortable and well-appointed. Ours had a fireplace and I think all the rooms have Kuerig coffee makers. Staff were friendly and obliging. I guess the only negative for me is that although the hotel is \" on the river\", this is not a great plus. The centre of Napa is OK, but the river borders the downtown and the view across it is to parking lots, car dealerships and the wine train depot. We booked our parents a balcony room overlooking the river with the thought we would meet there for a glass of wine before dinner but never did so because the view is industrial. None of the rooms have a view; the othe side of the hotel looks out on the parking lot. This is not a complaint. Stay here if you would like convenience and a nice room. Go elsewhere if you want the beauty and peace of the valley. Make sure you eat at Oenotri. One of the best value restaurants we have ever been in (and we have been in a lot!).", "Date": "May 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saratoga, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Getaway\u201d", "Author": "curtbrown", "ReviewID": "UR129240063", "Content": "We love Napa. Living only 90 minutes away, we try to get up there at least once or twice a year to get our fix. When we saw a Living Social offer for a package to stay at the Napa River Inn, we couldn't pass it up. We had never stayed in the Downtown area in the past, and we were more than a little surprised to see how they have redeveloped the area. After reading some of the other TA reviews of the hotel, we were looking forward to our stay. Upon arrival, we were impressed with both the charm of the hotel and the location in the historical waterfront area of the city. There are lots of older brick buildings with dozens of amazing restaurants, clubs and tasting rooms all within walking distance. What a great location...!!! We checked in and were given a room on the 2nd floor of the Embarcadero Bldg. with a balcony overlooking the river. While the room was cozy, it had lots of first class amenities - gas fireplace, refrigerator, Keurig coffee maker, a room safe, granite counter top in the bathroom, etc... As part of the Living Social package, we were given a number of extras as well - there was a bottle of wine and glasses waiting in the room on our arrival, we were given a $50.00 credit that could be used at a selection of first class restaurants (Fish Story, Morimoto's and Angele), a $50.00 spa credit, breakfast in the room, etc... Additionally, we were given vouchers for evening wine tasting at one of the local tasting rooms. After looking at the menus online, my wife made a reservation at Angele several days before our stay. The food was delicious and the atmosphere was great. I will go into more details in a separate review of the restaurant. In the morning, Sweetie Pies Bakery (on site) delivered our breakfast right to the room. Delicious...!!! This was our first visit to the Napa River Inn and we weren't disappointed. The staff was very friendly and attentive. the rooms and public areas were immaculate, and the location can't be beat. After staying further up in the valley (St. Helena, Calistoga, Yountville) in the past, we have now found a place where we have everything within walking distance and can have wonderful 'home base' from which we can head out on our day trips into the valley. We will return. Thank you Napa River Inn.

The shower was inadequate pressure so it took a while but was ok. The room was very nice, however, and that made up for a bit. The spa services were just massages, no gym or pool but was ok.

A delicious breakfast was included with our room and there are several options for lunch/dinner near by. Great meals at each of the places. When our car had an electrical short the morning of the car show, Staff provided the number of a towing company who understood classic cars, and we were able to meet the sign-in deadline to participate in the car show! No matter what time of day or night, all staff was gracious and caring, and provided information or assistance needed in each instance. In addition to the car show, we enjoyed the River Walk view, wandered downtown, and had a special side trip on the Dinner Train. It was a combination car show/early birthday event and our stay was made extra special by each of the staff that we met.

From the moment you enter the lobby you are impressed with the quality and attentive service they pride themselves on. When I booked the room I selected the dining package which comes with a 100 credit for any of the fantastic restaurants that are available in the immediate area. Upon check-in the front desk staff took the time to welcome us and explain how everything works. We got our key and headed for our room. It was spacious, clean, quiet, and romantic! First class toiletries and even a great bottle of Napa Valley wine wishing my girlfriend a happy birthday from the staff!!! We unwound with a glass of wine while we freshened up and then headed over to Tyler Florence's restaurant \"Rotisserie and Wine\" for our dinner. All I can say is \"WOW\" Best rotisserie chicken I have ever tasted. First class friendly service, great menu, fun laid back style, and an excellent wine list. Exactly what you would expect here in Napa Valley!!! The following morning we were greeted with our complimentary in room breakfast basket which we had ordered the evening before. It was fresh, delicious, and delivered on time! I can't say enough good things about our experience. From the sweet smells of the fresh flowers outside off our balcony to the evening stroll along the riverwalk, the great comfortable room to the fantastic meals and super attentive staff members - a memorable birthday experience for years to come!!!

The modern annex is of the soul-less variety, the decor remains characterless despite being overblown (impossibly high narrow beds, heavily wooden furniture taking up much needed space, floral curtains), and the carpets looked worn - there is nothing 'boutique' about most of the accommodation in this hotel and it is misleading that it calls itself a boutique hotel. There are no staff in the annex and I worried about security - although the door to it requires a room key to enter, it was left propped open during part of the day. Our room was small (far smaller than rooms of the same price that we stayed in elsewhere in San Francisco), had no view, and the 'balcony' could hold one person standing only. We rang reception when we got to the room to ask whether the beds were in fact single beds because they were so small and were told they were not single and not queen and so yes they were double beds. My husband and I slept badly here, there was literally no room to turn over. We had breakfast both days but you are required to have it in your room, an odd arrangement given that there is no table, just a narrow desk, and not enough chairs. The 'workout' room is just the size of a small hotel room itself and has two or three treadmills etc in it and was overly warm when we were there.

Typical hotel construction means that the ceilings are thin so the jumping on the floor by folks upstairs was a little annoying for awhile but they eventually went to bed! Speaking of beds, the beds are a little overdone. ( I don't know why hotels think people want beds made out of the lightest feathers.) It must have had a pillow-top cover that was VERY fluffy and the pillows were very fluffy and light too so no support for those of us who are a little older and need support in all the right places! But, if you like that kind of thing - you'll LOVE their beds. Breakfast from Sweetie Pies was very nice. Great baked goods. The area is an up and coming part of Napa and a little over-fabricated for tourists. As folks who consider themselves almost locals (we live about 50mi away), it's not what we consider typical wine-country.

They make it very easy to get around as they will drop you somewhere in their lovely, luxury town car for free and collect you later. The rooms are larger than we had experienced in many cities in the US and the beds were huge. At the end of our stay we realised we had left the key to our hire car in the saddle bag of the bikes we hired and it was now back at the hire shop in the next town and they even called and got it found and took us to collect it. This hotel was nothing like I expected.

Hotel has lovely cute garden and great to have breakfast at the balcony. You can start a great day with YUMMY breakfast with wide range of selection you can decide from. Hotel service is superb too. We were from Japan and did not have any ideas about how far the each location is from the hotel. As a result we walked to the Napa Outlet Mall and took us more than 30 min. As you can imagine, we were too tired to go back again so we requested a support to the hotel and they actually sent us a car to pick us up (was free of charge). It was great and saved our night there! Front desk and Concierge, they all were friendly and very helpful. I had organized the wine tour on the second day through them and it was great.

Also the heater had been set to low heat, to keep the room at a comfortable temperature for when we arrived back at our room. We had a very nice dinner at a local seafood restaurant and then returned to our room. The next morning, a very friendly man from room service arrived with our breakfast and the newspaper, which he set on the edge of our bed so we could enjoy it in the comfort of the warm blankets. Upon checkout, the friendly front desk staff asked if there was anything else that they could do for us before our departure. We asked for a recommendation of a nice place to walk around town, for which they provided a map, and then we were off. Overall, we loved our stay!

On our second night after disembarking the wine train and walking back to the Inn and past Silo's, the owner saw us, and ushered us into Silo's, ushered us to a table, and told us to enjoy the music never mentioning the cover charge and even telling us to \"never mind' the two item/drink minimum.

We might stay here again in the future, but there were a couple of minor drawbacks that prevented this from being the perfect spot. For one, the hotel allows (welcomes, in fact) pets. This was fine with us, and we were relieved to hear very little barking or whining during our stay. The regular presence of animals does give the rooms a faint smell, however. One of our friends who suffers pet allergies needed to take some Claritin, and we all observed the slight dog odor upon arrival. We didn't really notice it after our first day, so it wasn't too bad.

In this case, gotta say should have avoided. Nice clean hotel, but too many other issues. Booked an \"executive\" double with 2 beds. First room was ground floor, not very nice at all, and worst of all had the place to hang your clothes in the BATHROOM. Yes you read that correctly. What where they thinking? The front desk was no help at all in getting a different room, but the bell man saved us with some quick thinking. He was the only real positive spot of the stay. We were moved to a much nicer room on the second floor (of three), but overlooking an outdoor cafe and the river. If you do stay, be SURE to book a third floor room otherwise you will hear your neighbor overhead everytime they walk. The \"river\" is only a river at night when the tides come in, otherwise during the day it is simply a mud hole with no water in it at all. Really. The cafe is of course noisy during the morning and at other times, so you cannot enjoy the miniscule balcony at any time. Other rooms also overlook the restaurent located adjacent to the hotel, which is a great restaurent but not meant to be looked on from your hotel room. Just awful placement of restaurents unfortunately. It was pretty hot when we where there so the AC had to run all the time, which helped drown out the noise since it was so noisy itself. These are old style in the wall AC units that have 2 speeds, useless and runway takeoff speed. I had to \"build\" a wall of cushions on a chair to keep the AC from blowing hard in my face all night. Dreadfull. Any positives at all? Yes it was very clean and had a good location and free parking. Bottom line, this on NOT a \"luxury\" hotel, and should be avoided by those looking for an upscale place to stay. Try the new AVIA, wish we had.

Strangely enough, the Napa River and downtown Napa are not two of them. The Napa River is a narrow tidal strand and is either filled with turgid brown water or, if the tide is out, there is a lot of unappealing moss and mud. That's the way tidal rivers are. On the opposite bank is a railroad storage yard and an auto repair place It's not pretty. There is a \"river walk\" but it's a lot of cold concrete and stairs with little activity except right at the inn. The river banks at low tide are frankly a bit disgusting. So don't go for romantic river views. They ain't there. Also, downtown Napa is very uneven. Some blocks are completely deserted. It looks like it is awaiting a second or third redevelopment. You can cover the whole area, in depth and on foot, as you walk past scores of vacant store fronts, in less than an hour. We had the impression that the whole downtown area was just hanging on. The Ox Bow Market is within walking distance (not in downtown) but is nothing special. Tourist traffic all over Napa was pretty light for the high summer season, even with great weather. All this negative stuff having been said, this is a very good place to stay. It's all first class really. The rooms are large, beautiful and fresh. The staff is very accommodating. Parking is free and check in is easy. The free morning breakfast is delivered to your room and is a real treat. The two restaurants adjoining the hotel are excellent. The Napa General Store is right in the building and is a fun stop. There is very little traffic congestion in Napa and it is at the beginning of two wine trails.

The main reason for booking there was that it was the most reasonably priced option for us, and we needed 3 rooms for our 40th anniversary trip with our children, their spouses and our 15 month old grandchild. We were in for a pleasant surprise. This was our 4th stay at different hotels in Napa Valley, and Napa River Inn was great. The staff was extraordinary, with each and every one going out of their way to accommodate us. (We took the walking tour of Napa and tour guide said staff is better paid than at most hotels and have all worked there for an extended period.) The rooms were large and lovely. They included all the amenities we wanted, including balcony, magnifying mirror and robes. No problem using air conditioning, or with its location. Breakfast was delicious but I would recommend ordering it to your room, even if you want to eat on the lovely patio. Found Sweetie Pie's staff got overwhelmed and confused, and reluctant to provide food to go, although there were no tables large enough for our group outside the bakery.

However, I was still disappointed in the room at the Napa River Inn for the price we paid. We chose the option of a river view and it's true that you can see the river but the rooms in the older building are fronted by the walkway along the river and the ramp that accesses the hotel. Because of this, you wouldn't want to fully open the curtains in rooms on the first floor of this hotel because literally people are walking within feet of your windows. It also means that you can hear average conversations as people walk by outside or everytime the bellhop goes by with the luggage cart. A second level room would provide at least more privacy although I would guess you can still hear the conversations outside - and those rooms cost another $50 for the priviledge. On the plus side, the bed was terrific with nice quality bedding, the room was very clean and had all the amenities you might need including bottles of water so great care was given to making sure guest are comfortable. The service at the front desk was friendly and efficient. The bakery next door provided great baked goods for the breakfast that comes with the room. We chose to stay at this hotel because it was located near downtown Napa, thinking we would like to take advantage of walking to stores and restaurants however Napa seems to be going through a downturn and many stores were empty and there really wasn't much to see.

Since we needed to be at the meeting point at 5:30am, I decided we should stay overnight nearby. The Napa River Inn was within walking distance of the meeting point for the balloon ride and looked like a great spot right on the river. Mark and the folks at the Napa River Inn helped me organize the activities and went above and beyond to make sure this was a memorable event for my wife. In fact, it sounded so good I took off work early so we could eat dinner in Napa and then go to see a blues band play at Silo's. Unknown to me, the staff placed a bottle of cabernet wine and a personalized birthday card in the room for my wife. (She made me call to verify this wasn't a chargable item!) The room itself was luxurious and had everything we needed, including soft sheets, terry cloth robes, jazz cds, and a small fridge. In the morning, after gliding in the balloon across the mist covered valley, we came back to the room and rested.

Not to mention, later on, I found out ppl were saying 2 rooms in this hotel were haunted.... @.@ But it has received so many good reviews, and I've never stayed in a \"haunted\" hotel before..... I decided to give it a try, and made a last minute reservation -- the night before our trip to Napa. And I am glad we stayed in Napa River Inn, the experience was great! Although the check-in time is 4pm, we were able to check in to our room when we arrived the hotel shortly after 2pm, and we were automatically upgraded from standard room to executive room with a king size bed, that's just perfect for me & my 6Y & 4Y kids. The front desk staff was very nice & detailed. Our room was at the corner of the 2nd floor at Embarcadero building. The room was roomy enough for my 2 girls to play in the room. One thing I especially love about Napa River Inn was we were able to leave the window opened during the stay to enjoy the fresh cool breeze in the room. Although the drawback of that was also hearing the noise of loud music from the drive-by cars... and the clinking sound from pushing the cart w/ glass bottles... that's probably from the hotel restaurant .... Luckily these noises quiet down quickly around 9 or 10pm without disturbing our sleep. The location of this hotel is another plus. The reason I wanted to stay in downtown Napa was so that I could experience the place by walking, but wouldn't tire my 2 young kids too much. There was a riverfront trail just behind Napa river inn, the girls loved walking up & down the stairs, and going thru the \"tunnels\"..... and seeing the 2 ducks/geese (I couldn't remember) near the hotel's restaurant patio. With being so concerned about the pet odor in the room prior to our stay.... I found myself over worried.... The reason I didn't give a 5 stars is the location of the a/c in the room -- yes, I am picky. Although we did not use it at all, thanks to the window & the spring breeze in April, I didn't like it's right next to the bed..... imagine I had to turn it on if staying during hot summer or cold winter... the air from the a/c would almost directly blow on my head when laying down on the bed.... it's just not a comfortable feeling.", "Date": "April 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "N J", "Title": "\u201cnice\u201d", "Author": "EstelleNJ", "ReviewID": "UR61112357", "Content": "Your staff is wonderful - you should give them all a raise!

Second, it's a very nice hotel that's stumbling distance from many restaurants in downtown Napa -- an important consideration after a long day of wine tasting. PROS Spend the extra few bucks to upgrade from their standard room and you'll get a fireplace, balcony, or both. Their rooms are very comfortable and well-appointed. The best part is the included breakfast from Sweetie Pies Bakery (delivery to your room included) and the nightly wine tasting coupons! We opt to go out to Sweetie Pies (it's in the complex) because locals stop in there, so it's a great place to meet a few people and get the local scoop. And, Silo's Wine and Jazz club is outstanding! Keith, the manager, is always happy to make a winery recommendation so you just might find yourself modifying your wine tasting plans for the next day!

We asked to be in the same building but got told that was not an option, weren't offered the option to upgrade, and we got put in the Embarcadero buidling.

We could hear the conversation in the next room, that night I mentioned this to the front desk but wasn't offered a change of room. The next night they found it necessary to put someone on the other side of us, our headboards must of shared a wall for I could hear everything going on in their room until late at night. I got our paper the next morning at 6:45 AM and looking up and down the hall I only saw 3 papers and you guessed it, ours and the rooms on either side of us. I'm not sure why they couldn't space guests out except maybe it is easier for the maids. Our friends in the main building noticed the same lack of papers up and down their hall.

The parking was free and they give you a ticket to pop in the front of your vehicle window with your departure date on. With a cafe and nice restuarant on your doorstep it was a great place to stay. We walked 5mins down the road to a bar called 'Downtown Joes' which was a great bar, very welcoming and friendly.

We went down to concierge and spoke with the friendly lady on the desk, we ended up booking a next day limo tour with Beau wine tours $125pp. It was such a great recommendation.

The pictures of the rooms on the hotel web site looked a little fussy and claustrophobic, but our room was very nicely designed and included a fireplace, a sitting area and a balcony overlooking the Napa River. We booked it on their site as part of their \"mustard package,\" which was $270 a night and included coupons for things like 10% discounts at the General Store and Sweetie Pies, coupons to a wine tasting, etc. The free breakfast was nice! They give you a room service tag to hang on your door by midnight, and in addition to pastries and things you can order things like a bacon/egg sandwich. This hotel worked out perfectly for us, and we'd stay again if we had plans in Napa. I wouldn't, however, consider this a \"destination,\" hotel--in other words I wouldn't drive up to Napa just to stay there for the weekend. Although the staff and hotel itself are nice, the immediate area is not what I would call 'scenic.' As others mentioned, there's a lot of construction going on, and although it was nice to have a balcony, the view of the Napa river from the hotel with a busy highway beyond and industrial buildings is not exactly breathtaking. Also, when we arrived we went out to our balcony to have a drink before going to dinner, there was a group of what appeared to be homeless men sitting on the ground below us on the river bank drinking liquor from brown bags and being pretty loud. Being from SF, we're no strangers to the homeless problem, but it seemed like an odd thing to encounter at a hotel in wine country.

The bathroom was huge, and they gave a big basket of spa products. The free breakfast was amazing... It was from the bakery Sweetie Pies, next door to the lobby of the hotel. You get a choice of items, like an egg sandwich or fruit with yogurt and granola, and danish or low-fat mini cake (it was icky), juice or coffee... ALL of the items were freshly made and delivered right to the room. The egg sandwiches were the best, though; they were more like omelets on a bagel... very good and fresh... People have mentioned construction, and it was this reason that we didn't pay for a river view room. We didn't hear any construction noise, so no problems there... All in all this was a really place, and wasn't super expensive either. It was a short walk to the \"center\" of Napa where all the restaurants are.

The hotel is just a short walk away from downtown Napa where you can find plenty of shops and places to eat. Not that you would need to go elsewhere to eat. Our complimentary breakfast was more than enough to get us going for the day. In fact the portions are more than we could eat. On Friday night, we enjoyed the free wine tasting in the hotel lobby. And the highly-rated Celadon Restaurant is located right onsite. It's a very easy drive to Highway 29, where you can drive for miles and miles and see all kinds of vineyards and wineries, or just enjoy the scenery. Our favorite was the Artesa Winery, which is actually a bit of a drive off the beaten path, but well worth the extra effort. We also enjoyed the Beringer Winery.

I had an American Express offer of an upgrade and we rec'd Rm. #231 on the 2nd floor of the River Plaza Bldg. It had been updated recently and was in perfect condition; spacious and done in earth colors with deep terracotta-colored wallpaper, traditional European-style furnishings (very nice, but not luxurious), extremely comfortable King bed, 2 large armchairs, \"fainting couch\", writing desk and chair, and widescreen flat panel TV above the gas fireplace (a very nice treat on a chilly day). The bathroom was also quite spacious and had a marble counter, marble walls and tub surround, a towel warmer, extra large showerhead, bath robes, a small refrig. and even a small safe. There was a nice selection of teas plus pretty standard coffee. The only complaint we had with the room was that there was no place for 2 people to sit to eat our ample breakfast. I know the Inn says it's \"breakfast in bed\" but it would have been nice to have a small table. During warmer weather we could have eaten out on our small balcony which looked directly out to the Napa River and had a bistro table and 2 chairs. From our balcony we could watch the Wine Train heading to and from the depot; saw ducks, geese, seagulls and an egret in the river, and were treated to gorgeous fluffy clouds overhead and a nearly full moon that night. Construction work is ongoing along the river and along Main St. and so the area between the Inn and the River was not nearly as scenic as it will be when construction of the flood protection wall and the paved riverwalkway with landscaping is completed (prob. sometime in 2009--it's a huge project). There is also temporary green fencing up along the construction area and it's not a pretty sight. For those visitors who wish to sleep in, our riverfront room would not have been a good choice as the heavy equipment with \"beep, beep, beep\" warning signals began a bit before 7:30 a.m. (we stayed on a Wed. night). For my husband and me, it wasn't a problem since we were up by then. It was actually pretty interesting to view the work in progress and we saw some parents with their kids who came down to watch the earthmovers in action. Back to our complimentary breakfast (from the on-premises bakery, Sweetie Pie): one is able to choose from a number of different items and categories. I had a bagel stuffed with fluffy egg and cheese, a wholegrain scone and fresh fruit. My husband had a croissant stuffed with egg and bacon, a Danish pastry and fresh orange juice. The portions were very large and both of us had something leftover. Along with choosing what to have, we were able to designate the time that we wanted the breakfast tray delivered to our room--and it arrived exactly on time. The front desk person and the person who delivered our breakfast tray and also worked in the lobby were friendly and very pleasant. We loved the entire historic Old Mill complex containing the 3 bldgs of the Napa River Inn, the restaurants Celadon, Angele and Napa General Store (we had meals and or wine at all 3 and were extremely pleased), excellent art gallery and a pretty lavendar products shop. It's a visually delightful place (the artistic mosaic fountain in the River Plaza is particularly fun). It was great to be able to leave our car in the lot (free parking, I might add) and take a nice, easy walk up Main St. to any number of great restaurants, wine bars and lounges. You'l see some interesting historic bldgs as you walk north. The acclaimed n.v. restaurant where we had dinner is only about 4-1/2 blocks from the Napa River Inn. We also passed Zuzu and Cole's Chop House. And yes, we found n.v. to be the perfect dining experience: ambience, service and superlative cuisine. I can't recommend a restaurant more highly.

When we arrived, they gave us room 111 in the Embarcadero building with a \"view\" of the river. The room was small, but nice, and they left us a bottle of wine that I am assuming was for our anniversary, which I thought was sweet. We left our room to walk into town, and upon our return to our room that evening, we discovered a very loud humming sound. Upon my investigation, I found out that they put us in the room that backed up to the electrical supply room! Now, I am not a nitpicky person, but we were there for a special occasion and I knew that it would be impossible to sleep. Plus, at $260 per night, I decided that we shouldn't have to put up with the noise. I called the front desk, and they said that they would call us back with another room that was available. It was about half an hour before they called us back, which frustrated us a bit because it was quite late and we were tired after a full day of wine tasting! After I called the front desk back when I ran out of patience, the clerk said that the phone must have been broken also, because she had been trying to call us. Anyway, they sent a bellboy over to collect our things, and we were moved into the main building, room 233. Now this was more like it! I was told that this room was their most recently renovated room, and it had a view of the river (not too much to look at, but a nice gesture), a balcony, a plasma tv, fireplace, and marble bathroom. The robes in the room and the towel warmer were very nice amenities. The only thing that was odd was that the mini fridge and safe were in the bathroom, and they placed them where there was no electrical access, so the fridge was mildewed and we couldn't use the safe. We figured that maybe with their recent renovation it was probably somehing they overlooked, so we didn't think much of it. A nice touch was the breakfast that was included from Sweetie Pies. It was very good, and more than what you would expect for a free breakfast. From what I had heard around town, Sweetie Pies is the best bakery in Napa. All in all, we probably would stay here again if we could get one of the newer rooms, so I would definitely make sure that you request one.

My husband and I had a short 3 day weekend getaway to Napa. The service was wonderful throughout! After our bellman asked and we told him we were celebrating our anniversary, he came back to give us two champagne flutes, a bottle of sparkling wine and a box of decadent truffles. Napa River Inn staff are among the best I've seen. The location of the inn being very close to the highway, the COPIA which is a must-see in Napa, the Wine Train and one block away from the free downtown trolley (which includes a stop at Copia) is a major plus. I'd say the only downside is that the views aren't spectacular from any angle. I wasn't sure what to expect with the photos showing a grain silo-type structure in the middle of the inn. The room itself was clean and nicely decorated with tasteful art depicting Napa vineyards. We had turn down service and chocolate mints on our pillows waiting for us each night. The bathroom walls and floors looked like marble and the sink was actually marble top. The history of the mill adds a lot to the Napa River Inn. Yes, they used to store feed in the buildings a long, long time ago, but the government also used it to store wines and other alcoholic drinks. There are lots of photos, plaques, memorials, and memorabilia on the grounds that explain the interesting history. It's a pet-friendly inn and I saw several guests had their little well-groomed toy dogs with them, the concierge looked like she was informally doggie-sitting when I checked in. I'm allergic and thought that might be a problem but it was not. However, I was sneezing each time I visited a winery, so was glad I brought the antihistamines along. I was worried when our toilet backed up as soon as we arrived but when we called maintenance, they arrived very promptly, fixed it and it was never a problem again! For an extremely quiet and peaceful getaway I would stay elsewhere but for the fairly quiet but centrally located inn with various amenities located nearby, I would definitely recommend the Napa River Inn. The Greenhaus European Spa is across the parking lot and is small but has some good massage therapists and estheticians use Decleor-the best facial product around! The inn is on the same lot as two very popular and bustling restaurants: Angele and Celadon. People will come from other parts of town to dine at these restaurants-and they will crowd the parking lots at night. There is also an art gallery which doubled as a small jazz/blues dance club ($7 cover) on Friday night, a spa supply store and a General Store which sold snacks and unique gift items--however the service of those running the General store (I don't think it's managed by the Inn) was horrendous! There is also a new candy shop on the grounds which has lots of chocolates, etc. to choose from. Many restaurants, wine bars and hangouts are within blocks and Zuzus is one block away for good tapas and sangria. We were willing to do some driving to take in a couple of wineries. Our best find for dining was Rutherford Grille in Rutherford--fantastic! REcommended by the fantastic winery and deli next door (V Sattui). Also, I'd recommend Bistro Jeanty in Yountville for a relaxed and unpretentious but spectacular French menu. Domaine Chandon is a must. And Julia's Kitchen at Copia was great! At the Napa River Inn, we stayed in one of the \"superior\" room with a terrace facing Southeast, a fireplace we didn't use and a river view. There was NO construction going on at all while we were there but the riverbank did look muddy and unattractive. I was surprised there was no greenery other than a few wildflowers across the river; however that is not Napa River Inn's property. I heard and saw a few ducks and geese along the river right outside our terrace and saw the sunrise over the hills and trees in the far distance but there is also a view of a major street and car lot in the distance too--I could barely hear the cars at night but it was still audible. The room itself was neither large nor small. Free bottled Calistoga water in the fridge and Fiji bottled water on the table for $4.50 a bottle. The breakfast in bed which was included with our room rate was superb! We had to choose from danish, bun or scone AND egg/ham or egg/bacon or just egg sandwich on bagel or croissant OR granola and yogurt OR something else AND a choice of juices or tea or coffee. First morning I ordered the scone and the egg/ham bagel sandwich with regular (free) coffee. Second morning, the same but for an extra $4 I ordered a delicious 16 oz. mocha coffee. All of it was piping hot when delivered--you tell them the night before what 30 minute time slot you want it delivered. One morning I changed my mind and wanted it earlier and they gladly obliged by bringing it within 10 minutes. All the breakfast is made at Sweetie Pies which is a delightful bakery that has a large selection of beautifully made gourmet pastries, cakes, cookies, berry crumbles, you name it-they have it all! Hope this helps--be sure you know which direction your room will be facing. I would have hated a room in the plaza building that faces the lobby building and the restaurant outdoor seating area. Basically your window would face another building.

Coffee is made yourself in your room, which I've done many times in other hotels. However, this was the weirdest tasting coffee! We added the cream supplied in our mini-fridge and sugar substitute, as this is the way we usually have our coffee, but could not stand the strange flavor.

We had a positive experience. The hotel gave us all of our requests except the \"River View\" room, but it was all right because the sight wasn't that scenic, but is of more industrial view. One thing to warn you is that the hotel is in a restored historial building, so there is no soundproof to speak of, our room is right next to a public parking lot and neighborhood streets, and the road next the river was under re-construction that produced noise loud and clear. When I called the front desk, he explained to me that the city doesn't notify the hotel for such work. The good thing is, if you are patient, the work would stop no later than 10 PM, which is the city policy. The hotel rooms are spread out between 3 buildings, with shops and 2 resturants on site, so when the Mill is occupied by many visitors, the parking would seem scarce. The \"complimentary\" breakfast was provided by the on-site Sweetie Pie Bakery (separately owned, but in the same restored Mill location). The food are generous in size and rich in flavor. The morning room delivery service at your chose time is a gracious gesture offered by the hotel, but I highly recommend taking a few steps to walk to the bakery to enjoy fresh egg/cheese sandwich, one of the offerings, for example. I've seen a few breakfast baskets waiting for a while for the only hotel staff to deliver them. The warm sandwich would be cold by then. The bakery is not big, but you have the choice of seating indoor or outdoor. I don't recommend ordering the \"fruit plate\" as they were pre-prepared and refrigerated so some of the fruits didn't tasty as fresh. The bakery makes tasty treats, so you get to see locals coming in the door as well. Convenient location: The hotel offers 2 quality restaurants and is in walking distance to some of the town's other excellent eateries. It's 5 minutes drive to the Wine Train and 6 minutes to Copia (where twice a week has Farmer's Market, but I wasn't impressed). It's 9 Miles south of the quaint town of Yountville, where the famed French Laundary restaurant is.

Hotel's location was ideal. Staff helpful with offering hotel shuttle to get us to a restaurant on outskirts of town--particularly helpful since I was hobbling around in a cast from a broken ankle. Wine tasting at Bounty Hunter several blocks away was a nice touch. We went back a second night. Hotel itself is a well designed renovation of an old mill and warehouse. Renovations appear to be ongoing and there was construction noise. Also noise from the construction on the 3rd Street/Avenue? bridge over the river. That isn't the hotel's fault, but if you want to sleep in I suggest asking for a room away from the construction. Although promised a room that looked out on a garden, ours (in the historic section) actually looked out on an unimproved lot across the street. Room was lovely with king bed, nice partial canopy and wonderful appointments and amenities in the bathroom. However, price even with AAA discount was $315. for a weeknight--well above the range listed on Trip Advisor. The Sweeties Pies bakery deserves all the kudos it has received in other reviews, but our second day the hotel didn't have enough people to get all the breakfast baskets delivered in a timely way. My husband finally went down to the bakery and picked ours up. Not a big deal, but not breakfast in bed, either. Historic section of the hotel was nice because there weren't very many rooms and there was a wonderful sitting room adjacent to the elevator where one could sit and relax. We had no problem with noise between rooms as has been mentioned. The restaurant Celedon, one of two full-service restaurants in the complex, had outstanding food which was well-priced, I thought. One nice touch--large plate and small plate entrees and no hassle about how one ordered. There is both inside and semi-covered courtyard seating. My husband preferred inside, which is what we did, but next time--the courtyard for sure. One thing about the river--it looks more like a canal. I wouldn't worry if you can't get a room with a view.

Place looks much nicer than pictures on the website - always a nice surprise which rarely seems to happen.", "Date": "July 30, 2003"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Napa River Inn at the Historic Napa Mill", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g32766-d81234-Reviews-Napa_River_Inn_at_the_Historic_Napa_Mill-Napa_Napa_Valley_California.html", "Price": "$259 - $406*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">500 Main Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Napa</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">94559</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "2516174", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/ec/6c/ec6c02d10776cc0b63534138161d5ee25large.jpg"}}
