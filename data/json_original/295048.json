Breakfast was disgusting. If you're european you won't be able to touch it. The only acceptable dish was some kind of pie with chocolate, but because it's the only tasty you can find there, it finishes immediately, so if you're thinking of having your breakfast at 8 thirty or so you won't find it. There were also some creepy/ perverts from Libya who touched the girls and tried to abuse us. Don't go there. The only positive thing is that it's close to Taksim square and the prices are logical.
