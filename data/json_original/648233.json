They offered lots of advice and suggestions about how to get around. As travelers who like nice accommodations during the even, but tend to budget, they did not try to oversell us on tours or experience tourist attractions. The breakfast was really nice -- a traditional Turkish buffet with a mixture of meats, olives, cheeses, eggs, breads and pastries, and other varieties of tasty treats. On nice days you can go upstairs to enjoy a view of the city. The hotel is very convenient to the Blue Mosque, Aya Sofya, and other attractions that are close by, but you need to travel a little further to get to the heart of the restaurant districts or other parts of town.

The location was the best possible as all the top places of interest like Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace, Hagia Sophia, Basilica Cistern, Grand Bazaar are 5 minutes of leisurely walk away. But an even greater highlight was the amazingly hospitable staff. We were on a 6 day stopover trip with only 2 days in Istanbul carrying 4 large suitcases and Mr Sadik on hearing our travel plans himself offered to store our luggage for us free of charge while we went touring the rest of Turkey. That was one big problem for us solved in less than 2 mins of checking in. As if that wasn't enough, when we returned to pick our bags after taking an overnight bus from Cappadocia and with a few hours to spare for our flight, he offered us breakfast and a room to freshen up and rest and later even refused to take any payment for that. Then he arranged our airport transfer and by the time we stepped out of the room, our bags were already loaded. I have travelled the world but never seen this level of hospitality or personal care and attention to the clients. I think it is that what makes Asmali hotel the best place to stay in Istanbul.

If you have a sensitivity to mold do not stay here. Mold issues notwithstanding, I wanted to write a very fair, honest account of the Asmali Hotel and their friendly, hardworking management staff. Unfortunately, I also have to agree with others who have written reviews here about the Asmali and expressed disappointment at this hotel after so many glowing reports. We stayed at the Asmali for 1 week, end of September 2010. The location is decent but the immediate neighborhood is not particularly charming or even attractive (see Alex_Jei review, Jan 7. 2010). There is a roof top terrace which is reasonably clean, though there is random clutter that\u00c2\u00b4s kept in one corner that\u00c2\u00b4s a real eye-sore. There is a semi-obstructed view of the Blue Mosque that faces the building and on the other side there is quite a nice view of the Sea of Marmara (You can also see clearly the roof top terraces of those who have spent a little more for their accommodations than you have...!). The hotel is essentially kept clean and the rooms have a/c and mini fridge but the walls are thin (easy to hear neighbors) and the doors are made of some sort of fortified plastic, not wood, and at night the motion sensors on the staircase activate at the absolute last moment, just nanoseconds before you think you\u00c2\u00b4re going to plunge head first down the staircase. The shower in our room defied basic principles of both logic and design: No shower door, water goes all over the bathroom and pools on the floor. Breakfast is OK but you don\u00c2\u00b4t have to look too hard to see that a minimal effort is made and that corners are regularly cut. None of the fruit juices are fresh, everything\u00c2\u00b4s canned, or worse. Some of the Turkish specialties served at breakfast are tasty but the breakfast, like the hotel, is unremarkable and basically needs an overhaul. The two managers of the hotel were very friendly and try to be helpful, but some of the ones working in the late evening had very limited English skills and didn\u00c2\u00b4t really seem to want to make an effort to understand what we were asking. Overall assessment: If you have a sensitivity to mold, DO NOT STAY HERE; if you do not have a sensitivity to mold, and are looking for a good location in Sultanahmet that\u00c2\u00b4s basically clean, in a quiet neighborhood, with a roof top terrace with a nice view, AND costs less than 100 euros per night, then you might like the Asmali.

Overall, the hotel has some good points, esp. the location and the staff. The location is quite good \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the hotel is is located in a relatively quite side street, close to the Sultanahmet Square (about 10 minutes walk, slightly uphill when heading towards the square), with the major sights of Agia Sofia, Blue Mosque, Basilica Cistern, and a variety of cafes and restaurants. At the square, there is also a tram stop (which will most probably become your major transportation system, as it takes you to the Grand Bazar in one direction and to other to Eminonu, where the Spice Bazar is and from where you can access ferry boats, as well as get to the station Kabatesh , from where you take the funicular to Taksim) . The Hop On Hop Off Bus also leaves from Sultanahmet. The staff of the hotel is incredibly nice and polite. Check in and check out went smoothly; we were also allowed to leave our suitcases till 1:30 pm in the room, until our pick-up service arrived. Now, to aspects that disappointed us and made us feel we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get value for money. The hotel is three floors high, with rooms also in the basement. The terrace is probably the only floor with a good view. The rooms towards the front side have an ok-ish view, of other houses \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but the back side rooms really offer a depressing view, namely of a wall. The first two days, we were given a room on the ground floor, back side. The room was tiny, not enough space to even open one suitcase, very problematic to put two suitcases even standing upright. Nothing like the pictures. Only a bed, two nightstands, one closet (relatively large, with safe inside, drawer underneath), a TV, telephone. Not even a chair. You felt like in a cell. Plus, as it is on the same floor as the reception, you kept walking up by phones ringing and people walking by the room to get to their rooms. On request, we were relocated to the second floor, but again back side. It was slightly more quiet, but again, when people go up to the breakfast room (and this is really the fault of the guests), you usually hear them, talking loudly and almost stomping up the stairs. The room was slightly larger, but again facing a wall, and not providing space for a chair (this time we also had a DVD player). The bathroom tiny again, just enough space for one person to fit in (shower is not like in the pictures, no door to close, so floor gets wet). Only little space to spread out your toothbrush etc. (though there is a cupboard under the sink). The only mirror in room is in the bathroom, no dressing table in room. The paint of one wall in the room is coming off, probably due to dampness. We took a peak at the front rooms and they did seem larger and more attractive, definitely more spacious and airier. It seems unfair to be charged the same price for so different rooms. Now, the rooms were overall clean, though the toilet seats in both rooms did require some cleaning when we first checked in \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on both, there was something like dust (in any case, the toilet paper I used to clean the seats turned yellowish-brown). Luckily, we had Dettol Antibacterial spray with us. Hotel provides ample usual toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, body lotion). Towels are changed if you place them on the shower floor. Another bad aspect: bathroom shares air duct with bathroom of other room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so you hear even the faintest noise from your neighbor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bathroom. Breakfast is quite ok (but not as great as I had expected). The breakfast room is on the top floor, about 6 tables are provided, some tables have views of the top of the Blue Mosque. It is only if you go to the terrace that you get a view of the sea (but not something you do in winter). Breakfast menu: spread of 3 cheese-sorts, some salami, ham, 3 different olive types, jam, honey, butter, bread (really not nice bread \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but I think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the general sort of bread to be found), milk, yoghurt, cornflakes, cheese pastry, cakes, cookies, and some dishes prepared each day. Different teas, Nescafe, and cappuccino/espresso. However, the staff is extremely friendly, and if you need something, they seem very happy to provide it (we asked daily for omelet, others asked for their bread slices to be toasted). Overall impression: we would have been very happy had we had a less depressing and cramped room (or had we paid less for the room); the hotel has quite a good location, is quite clean, breakfast ok, and staff very nice. As it is, we were slightly disappointed and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it was such good value for money spent.", "Date": "January 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "melbourne", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location and service\u201d", "Author": "selmah", "ReviewID": "UR51751974", "Content": "We are a young family with three children between the ages of 11 and 5.

The staff at the reception was again very friendly, with everyone being able to speak very good English and being very eager to help with advice whenever required. Another great point for this hotel is that it is situated so centrally in Sutlanahmet, having maybe one of the best positions there. It is both central as well as located on a quiet street, thus giving you an apportunity to rest. Let's not forget about the free parking which we enjoyed for the entire week that we spet there.

Also, I would recommend the Yani Marmara in the evening - it's just round the corner from the hotel and had a great atmostphere - we smoked nargile and played backgammon - very typically turkish!", "Date": "August 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cCheck which room you book!\u201d", "Author": "Gulliva", "ReviewID": "UR35123748", "Content": "1.

We were asked to pay for the total stay when we arrived - even though the booking form said we were to pay at the end. This was very inconvenient and we later realised was because they thought we would leave. 3. The room we spent the first two nights was very small. Two people couldn't stand on the floor at the same time. No room for cases. One side of the bed was against the wall; the other was a metre from the window. The room was below street level and next to the office - so very noisy during the night when the night staff were conversing with their friends just outside the door. 4.

Pls read my review before you act. Trust me! It totally dashed my honeymoon, and the prior good time we had in Greece. Turning up in Istanbul with this hotel made everything go south. Let me share my experience: 1. Pick-up did not turn up at airport. I had to beg some local there to use their mobile to call up the hotel. Then they conveniently got some partner who are there to pick other guests to pick us up, without even knowing our names. So can we trust him to board his transport? When we finally got to the hotel, staff- Ali did not bother to apologies, but blushed off saying that he is not a computer, he can forget things. (i.e. forget to arrange our pick-up). 2. The very next moment, Ali asked for full payment for our 4 nights stay (we have not even stepped into our room, still with him at reception). The bad stay only reaffirm my initial belief that they are not confident of their own hotel, they were afraid we would check out after 1 night. True enough! 3. They were so keen and eagar tro ask for full payment, but guess what! they owe my my change. I have to keep asking him for it and he just pushed it to another staff. Is this the right way? Finally we got back our change, but NOT in EURO, but in Lira and shortchanged!!!!!!!! 4. Safe in room can be moved, they are not fixed to the cupboard. Furthermore, you cannot operate it by pin code (battery compartments has melted mercury) I checked with Ali, he told me not to worry, his hotel is very very safe. Do you think you should feel at ease when its your 1st day, safe can be moved, and only operated by key (which you won't know if hotel has another set of the key). - see photos. 5. We booked the suite, but it turned out to me just like any normal room (Def. overcharged). Hot water only come on for 2-3 mins, then cold water will take over. Tables and chairs have cracks, we did not even dare to sit on them. Who knows the moneyminded hotel will ask us to compensate for any \"damages\". 6. Bathroom full of mosquitos and flies. (see photo) 7. Pillows provided can be as \"slim\" as a piece of paper, so i asked for 2 additional pillows. I was prepared to even settle for 1 since its a BnB hotel, knowing my expectation shouldn't be that high. Guess what! Ali told me he needs to check if the hotel has extra pillows, he will get back to me! To the very moment when i checked out, i did not hear from him regarding the pillows. 8. I agree with the other travellers who wrote that hotel staff were more keen to sell us travel package. 9. Although its a BnB, but guests should not be offered EXPIRED drinks in the fridge right? What more, a rusty bottle opener. (see photo) 10. Room door shows signs of past attempted break-in? (see photo) Overall, i can only conclude that choosing this hotel has total ruined my honeymoon, and i will strongly not recommend this hotel to anyone. I may be wrong, try it if you want, and correct me subsequently with your pleasant experience.

So the location is perfect for commuting around and as well as for anywhere in Istanbul! 2. The rooms are clean and cozy with tidy washrooms. The housekeeping is good enough and so is the breakfast that the hotel staff so affectionately takes care about. 3. What else, hm... great staff, very friendly, accommodative and supportive. Won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t turn your request down unless they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a choice! All of them are very considerate.

Cool views from the roof. The hotel's transportation from the airport and then to the ship we were catching to Kusadasi was smooth and comfortable.

To the hotel itself:- We were upgraded to a suite because of the length of our stay. Which meant we had another room where a small table & 2 chairs were positioned along with a small desk & chair, a spacious wardrobe & small tv & bar fridge. We appreciated having the extra space. The suite was spacious (by Istanbul standards), clean & pretty Ottoman decor (by anyone's standards). The staff were beyond reproach. One helpful young man, walked us to the restaurant for dinner when we asked directions, some 15mins away. He refused a tip. Breakfast was delicious & they specially prepared your choice of omelette on request. Breakfast could be served on the rooftop if you preferred but it was cool the days we stayed in Istanbul so we ate in the dining room. The position of Asmali is great because you only hear a feint 'call to prayer' & its near to a choice of restaurants without being in a bussling surround. They have double glazing on the windows for added insulation. Its a small boutique hotel which basically means you get individual attention making it a unique place to stay in a very busy city full of demanding tourists like ourselves. Nothing was too much trouble for them to fulfill. The owner drove us around to inspect alternative accommodation for our return visit.

Things didn't start off too well when we arrived tired from the airport at 7:30 pm looking forward to a rest, and were told that the room wasn't ready because of a late checkout. Although we ate on the plane, they suggested that we get some dinner. which we reluctantly did, and on returning at 8:20 we again found that it still wasn't ready. We were then bundled upstairs to the breakfast room and given a cup of tea to drink on their roof terrace, where we shivered for 10 minutes before coming back inside. We hung around the breakfast room till 9pm, and finally walked down to the room to see what was happenning to find it still being cleaned. Finally at 9:15 we got the room! We then realised that we had made a mistake booking here. The \"suite\" was no more than 24 sq metres (240 sq ft) including the bathroom with big, chunky furniture, so that with 2 suitcases on the floor there was hardly any room to walk around. There was also a faint smell of cigarette smoke, and at times the bathroom smelled musty. But worst of all for me was the bed. Far from being \"at least 2.1 metres\" (as we were promised) it was a small double bed, no more than 2 metres long (6ft 6in) with both head- & footboards. When I tried to stretch out, with my toes touching the footboard, my head hit the headboard. Needless to say I didn't sleep well that night. The next morning we found a much nicer hotel with a big room and large bed in a better location for the remaining 4 nights for 20 euros more, and worth every cent.

I had a little problem with the room booking (done via a website) and Mr. Saadettin Cesmeci, the owner, helped me sort it out. In fact, he upgraded our room while at the same time gave us a discount! He also helped us arrange the transportation from/to the airport & hire a tourist guide, a car, and a driver. My family was very pleased with his recommendation (if you ever need a tourist guide in Istanbul, ask for Hasan Bozacioglu). Asmali Konak is perfectly located at the heart of Sultanahmet District. It's a 10-minute walk from Aya Sofya, Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace, and the Marmara Sea. A quick jog in the neighborhood is a wonderful way to start a day. The hotel consists of 8 rooms. The ones with balcony are facing another building behind the hotel while the ones without balcony are facing the street. The best view, however, is from the roof top where you can see the Blue Mosque and the sea. There is no elevator in the hotel. No need to worry about your luggages, though. The staff will help you carry your stuff upstairs. If you have problems climbing the stairs up and down, book a room on the lower floors. There reception area on the ground floor is very small. Thus, whenever we needed to wait for somebody, we had to wait in our room or the breakfast room upstairs. I stayed in room 302. The room is small but if you utilize all the closets and cabinets in the room to store your stuff, you will have more space. I shared the room with my Mom and Dad. Thus, we put an extra bed in the room. Additionally, each of us carried a medium size luggage and a duffel bag. We managed to fit everything in our room and still felt comfortable enough. We spent most of our time exploring the city anyway. The bathroom is small but clean and modern (the towels were changed every day). There is not much space to hang our clothes, though. I resolved the problem by using the cabinet under the sink to store the clothes. The water temperature in the shower is unpredictable. It could go from really cold to really hot. The trick is to do a quick shower while the temperature is \"right.\" Breakfast is modest but sufficient. I don't usually eat much breakfast but surprisingly I ate too much every day I was in Asmali Konak. My favorite: warm baguette with honey and butter, fried spring roll with Feta cheese inside, cherry juice, Turkish tea (chay), Saadettin's omellete (yes, he prepared it himself), and fried potato/sausage mix (prepared by Saadettin's daughter). The staff are very friendly and helpful. They would go out of their way to help you. Saadettin is quiet man but the 3 words he utters the most are the ones that brought a big relief whenever I requested his help: \"Yes, of course.\" It was absolutely great that we got to enjoy our holiday while somebody else took care of the other details. We stayed in Asmali Konak on March 17-21, 2008 and my parents are already talking about coming back.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a small hotel with lots of atmosphere -good breakfast too and a great roof terrace to admire the cityscape from!", "Date": "March 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "netherlands", "Title": "\u201cGreat Service\u201d", "Author": "Vraagteken", "ReviewID": "UR14205017", "Content": "We had to be in Istanbul partly for pleasure and partly for Business. After a long search of hotels we came via tripadvisor to the asmali hotel. It is a small hotel not far away from the blue mosque and the hippodrome. ( 5 min) Our room was bigger than the standard rooms in other hotels and all was very clean and had nice furniture. The service of the hotel is excellent. One day I was to a meeting about 15 km from the center and my wife got sick. They threated her very kindly, made thee etc. An other evening I had a dinner in the other hotel. They insisted to bring her by car to the hotel because off safety. We would recommend this hotel because off his service, rooms, price and location. I would advise to let them pick you up from the airport like we did. I saves money and much time. We wish you an nice stay in Istanbul.

Before anything else I would just like to say an enormous 'thank-you' to all those at the hotel for making our trip so special! What makes it so wonderful? Well, where to begin? The owner, Saadettin and his staff made us extremely welcome. They were happy to spend time talking with us on an evening over tea, offer us help and guidance and book restaurants and events for us too. The location is ideal as it is literally 5 minutes walk to 2 of the most famous sights- The Blue Mosque and Haghia Sofia, however, as it is located on a quiet side street, that is well lit and clean, in a friendly neighbourhood, you are able to relax and get a very peaceful night's sleep. The rooms are extremely clean and comfortable and are attended to every morning with fresh towels provided. Upon arrival we found a lovely plate of fresh fruit and dessert awaiting us, which was a very pleasant surprise. There are tea and coffee facilities in the room and these are amply stocked with lots of different teas. The free transfer from the airport is also excellent too, and waited over an hour for us with no complaint. Breakfasts are appetising and offer a wide range of choice, from cereals to scrambled eggs and hot food, through to the more tradiional Turkish fayre of olives, cheese, jam and bread, all of which was delicious and in plentiful supply. The staff also cooked us an omelette each morning, without us even having to ask! In addition to the above, what makes this hotel such a wonderful place to stay is the fact that you are treated as so much more than just an anonymous traveller. At the Asmali Konak you are a very welcome and welcomed guest, and made to feel that you are valued. I have stayed in 5 Star Sandals resorts in the Caribbean, and 5 star hotels in London, but never have I been made to feel as welcome, cared for and as special as I was here. Saadettin and his staff cannot do enough for you- he even posted our postcards when we ran out of time! He is a most kind and generous host, who also has excellent taste, so if he recommends any restaurants, then I recommend you follow his advice! Ender- one of the night staff- made us cups of tea and chatted with us when we came back and told us lots of interesting things about this wonderful country and the city of Istanbul. The warm tea and friendly chat was especially welcome after a long day out. It snowed heavily while we were there, and we were always grateful to come back to our warm romantic rooms. I would thorughly recommend this hotel to any one who wants to stay in comfort, feel very special and looked after, and who, most importantly, wishes to experience true Turkish hospitality, and to not just be an anonymous guest in a impersonal chain hotel. Istanbul is a magical and exciting city and The Asmali Konak is definitely the place to stay. I will certainly be returning very soon!", "Date": "February 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Georgetown", "Title": "\u201cHighly recommended special Sultanahmet hotel\u201d", "Author": "Georgetown83", "ReviewID": "UR13695823", "Content": "The Asmali Konak Hotel is a splendid place to stay within the historic district of Sultanahmet, Istanbul. Unlike most of the other Sultanahmet hotels, the Asmali Konak is located in a quiet residential area away from ceramic shops and carpet stores. However, you will still be close by to all the historic sites (and shops); but you will be spared the sometimes unnerving experience of running the gauntlet of hard working merchants dedicated to the tourist trade every time you leave or return to your hotel. The Asmali Konak is a recently (1 year ago) rebuilt family house that stands in a row of family dwellings that date back to the 1940s. The conversion has been done sensitively to create an intimate hotel of just 8 rooms. The hotel's website (http://www.asmalikonakhotel.com) gives you a good idea of how most of the rooms look like. However, the website does not include pictures of the two single rooms. I have discussed these singles below and you can see my pictures of them here as well. The double rooms are spacious by Turkish and European standards. American travellers used to the sizes of motels back home may find these rooms smaller than what they are familiar with. Two of the double rooms face a lightly travelled road. The other four double rooms face the next house. The advantage of not having a street view is that you will not be woken by the 5.30 am call to prayers issued every morning by the mosques in the neighbourhood. (By the way you can see the dome and minarets of the Blue Mosque from the breakfast room.) The double glazing on the windows muffles most of the street noise for the rooms that do face the street. It is a quiet street with only the noise of the occasional passing car. Traffic stops after about 10.30 pm. The families who live along the street go about their chores silently... there is a small playground at the end of the street and the children who play there are some the most well behaved I have seen anywhere. The double rooms are suite-like in providing a discrete seating area away from the bed(s) and bathroom. I recommend Room 201 to single travellers. It's a cosy room that receives good connection from the free hotel WiFi. I managed to stay in touch with my colleagues around the world right through my 11-day stay, thanks to their stable WiFi. The only \"comment\" one may have about Room 201 is that the glass-panelled shower stall does not have a door. As a result the floor of the bathroom does get damp. It's an easy problem to fix. Just lay your bath towel on the floor (like a rug) after your shower and the floor will be dry again in no time. I stayed in Room 101 for three nights. It's a nice enough room. It is what's called a \"promotional room\" in Istanbul. It's small and only suitable if you do not travel with a large suitcase. There's not much spare space for you to place big pieces of baggage here. The impressive feature about 101 is its bathroom which is large and well designed. The bed is placed right beside the windows which open out to the street level. You will see the wheels of cars parked outside if you were to stand in front of the windows and look out. The street noise however is manageable, and the neighbourhood does go still after midnight. The sounds that may bother you in this room come from the hotel office which is right outside its room door. Towels were in ample supply throughout my 11-day stay. The house keeping was first class; thanks to the very capable and gracious housekeeper. She also makes the hearty breakfast in the mornings for the guests. Breakfast is a very consistent offering of scrambled eggs, sausages, and mini cheese rolls. The house keeper will make you a special omelette is you ask for it. She is also wonderful in offering every guest a basket of fresh hot toast. There is an endless supply of Turkish tea and instant coffee. The Asmali Konak is also special in that it has a small espresso machine where guests can percolate their own fresh cup of caffeine if Nescafe is not your preferred brew. The hotel is very efficiently managed by its director, Mr.Saadettin \u00c3\u2021e\u00c5\u0178meci (Email: <[--]> or <[--]>). He speaks fluent English and is most prompt with his replies to emails. If you are staying for more than three days, the hotel may offer to meet you at the airport upon arrival if you are flying into Attartuk. The person who will meet you is most likely Mr. Saadetttin's nephew. He does not speak English but is a most gracious man. In one of the pictures taken outside the hotel after one of the rare snowfalls in Istanbul you will see Mr. Saadettin on the left with his cousin next to him. I am happy to recommend the Asmali Konak Mansion to you for a comfortable stay in one of the most authentic residential quarters of historic Istanbul.", "Date": "February 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seoul", "Title": "\u201cReview from Korea\u201d", "Author": "jdrules", "ReviewID": "UR13446386", "Content": "Awesome place to stay in Instanbul!
