This year, the Tamarindo public beach nearby provided fantastic snorkeling with many, many turtles in various sizes, lots of stingrays and fantastic fishes in every possible size and color. The new caretakers were lovely and immediately provided whatever was needed. We often cook in our kitchen and enjoy the view from the terrace, the view has to be seen and I will look for a pic to post. We often think we should be trying a new place, but then in the fall our kids say: let's go back again. With the nearby Flamenco Beach, the drive to Zoni Beach, the usual dinner at Mamacita's and kayak rentals we might return again next year.As the kids will be off to college, we plan to invite my sister and brother in-law to join us instead. I can only think of one thing that could possibly be improved at this wonderful place; having wider beds, the nightstands should be tossed out and queen beds added.

This is a very special place - you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find anything else like it on Culebra. No wonder people return here year after year! This was our first time, but we will be back. When we arrived for a week in February, the place had been undergoing a process of rejuvenation. Everything was newly painted; repairs had been made; things looked fresh and clean. The new resident caretakers welcomed us and made us feel right at home. They were eager to accommodate our needs, and asked for our feedback. The atmosphere was friendly and relaxed. The three cottages on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153estate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are spread out on a hillside facing Luis Pena Cay and the mountains of Puerto Rico beyond. It is a beautiful natural setting: quiet and peaceful. The sunsets and starry skies at night are spectacular. Each cottage has three units with (mostly) covered decks facing the water. The units are simple, but clean and adequate for two people. The covered deck is spacious and comfortable, with table, chairs and a charcoal grill. The bed is a standard double, and there is no hot water except in the shower, (which was not a problem for us, but something to be aware of). There are no cooking supplies provided (except coffee filters), but we found plenty of provisions at the local grocery stores and cooked most of our meals, with occasional forays out for dinner. The small freshwater pool down by the beach is a little oasis \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a place to relax, read and cool off after a day in the sun and saltwater. Although the beach at Tamarindo is rough coral, and getting into the water at low tide takes some practice (there is one good spot at the north end by the pool), the snorkeling is incredible. Green turtles feed in the eelgrass just off the beach, and a colorful variety of reef fish make their home in the coral. There are several other good snorkeling spots, notably Carlos Rosario, and the wonderful sandy beach at Flamenco, very near by. Tamarindo is not a resort and Culebra is not a resort island. For those like us, who avoid resorts and instead seek simple, unpretentious places to explore, swim, snorkel, walk, read and relax in beauty and tranquility, it was perfect! Thank you, Dennis and Gail, for your wonderful hospitality.

We have enjoyed visiting Culebra eight times, staying at Tamarindo Estates the last six times. A special place to which we will surely return. Tamarindo Estates is a modest, well-maintained, gated refuge. The twelve house-keeping units are small but adequate---simple but clean. The kitchens are OK for breakfasts and lunches; we have not tried to cook dinners. The terraces provide spectacular views of sunsets and starry, night-time skies. The management is friendly and responsive to all requests. The Tamarindo Estates private waterfront is broken coral, not sand, and access to the water is difficult (enter at the north end), but once in one finds wonderful snorkeling (turn south, left, along the outer edge of the coral heads). A quarter-mile walk distant is Tamarindo Beach, which provides sand and easy access for less spectacular snorkeling. Difficult to reach Carlos Rosario Beach may offer snorkeling better or equal to that at Tamarindo Estates, but there is no other equal on the island or perhaps elsewhere in the Caribbean. Also on the Tamarindo Estates waterfront is a small, well-maintained, fresh-water swimming pool. A Jeep is essential on Culebra. We have rented from Carlos. Three colmados in town provide adequate grocery selections. Restaurants change from year to year, with Mamacitas, Dinghy Dock, and Barbara Rosa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perennial and enduring favorites. Flamenco Beach is spectacular. It is crowded on weekends, as is much of the island, which makes one appreciate even more the privacy of Tamarindo Estates.

The town itself is either humble or unimpressive, depending on your point of view, but there are some good places to eat: I'd rate Susie's, Club Seabourne, El Eden, and Zacos Tacos as by far the best.

So I am very hesitant to share our favorite spot. If you are the kind of person that wants the caviar to burst in your mouth in a precise moment, stop reading, go elsewhere. This is not Ritz Carlton style. The cottages are small and simple. You get a small bedroom and a kitchen with all utilities. The equipment is old, but clean and it works. It gets pretty hot in the summer and you need to run AC all the time you are inside. The AC is window type in the bedroom only. In winter nights are cool, so you generally do not need it. The unt is adequate for two and may be one child, no more than that. Although ther are 12 units, we rarely met more than a couple people at a time. The grounds are large. Practically all units have a beatiful view of the beach. You have to walk to the beach for 3-4 minutes. It is a private beach with great snorkelling that begins at less than a foot of water depth. It is all coral, there is no sand, lots of sea urchins, you have to be carefull. There is another beach within 5 minutes walk where you can always find turtles feeding on turtle grass. For sunbathing and swimming you can ride (5 minutes) or walk (25 minutes) to the Flamenko beach. Plenty of sand and coladas there. You can find light fare on Flamenko or go to the town for a restaurant. Alternatively you cook in your room. Tamarindo also has a small freswater pool next to the beach. It is surronded by the walls, very private and for most part you will be the only one there. The quiet and serenity is a trademark of the place, If you like simple and very relaxed vacation - this is for you. The groundkeepers there are very friendly and are ready to attend your needs and give you a nice advice. If you want to move around the island, it is best to rent a car. Taxi is easy to get during the day and is cheap, but forget about it if you want to go for a dinner. For SCUBA divers there is a SCUBA shop in town, but I have a mixed experience with it. As long as this place remains peaceful and quiet, we will be coming there again and again. If you decide to come too, please come in small numbers so that we preserve its beaty and serenty.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m assuming the cottages were originally built to house the plantation workers and therefore were probably never designed to be particularly nice. The owners apparently want to maintain the apartments in the same spirit, because our apartment was beat up, run down, and shabby all over. Just setting foot in the place I knew I had made a huge mistake, and when the property manager pointed to the shower and said, \"the stronger you run the water, the colder it gets,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that confirmed it. The soft, saggy, full-sized bed and both pillows are sealed in plastic bags, which you will feel and hear just beneath the thin sheets all night long.

Bottom line: the point of a Culebra vacation is to enjoy the outdoor beauty and attractions, not hole up in your hotel room.

My boyfriend and I bought charcoal and had a cookout one night under the stars with the ocean as our soundtrack...incredible. The cottage itself and the grounds were very well maintained. We had a few roosters and chickens, but none of them crowed and woke us up, which was nice. The managers that greeted us, Karen and John, a married couple, gave us such a nice, warm welcome, it was really great. Karen helped us with restaurants and beaches for snorkeling and how to get places....basically like having our very own travel guide. I would visit again just to say hey to them. I would suggest renting a car or scooter if you stay here because it's a little out of the way. That said, the island is so small that means 7 minutes from town instead of 4.

Each small apartment has a balcony with tables and chairs. There is a shower outside to clean up before going to the apartment. There is a barbecue pit in front of the villas with tables. The place was clean and comfortable. The walk to the beach is a long one but once you get there the view is fabulous. The pool is a good size and the pool house is equipmed with bathrooms and shower. The beach house has tables and you can also barbecue there. The property manager was very helpful and was always there when we needed him. Adults and kids enjoyed the place. The best snorkling in the island is right in front of this property, we found out it is a natural reserve. The only problem we found is that you must bring your food supplies from the main island or be prepared to pay the prices of culebra. They do not have supermarkets but small stores. We found everything we needed but not always in the same place. Make sure that you rent a jeep (we did) or you will not be able to move around at wish. We did find that taxi drivers are easy to find and during off hours if you make previous arrangements they will pick you up and wait for you to take you back to the hotel. There are many restaurants in town. Recommendations: The most beautiful beach is Flamenco beach - a taxi ride away. You can walk it but there are no side walks and you can not always see the cars coming so we decided it was safer to drive there. There you will find kiosks with food and beverages. Make sure you get your ferry tickets early as they sold out fast and be on line at least an hour before if you are traveling with luggage. There is a car transport that works from Monday to Friday, if you want to take your car from the mainland a reservation is needed but it does not work on Saturday and Sundays.

Since we spent a lot of time looking into the accommodations in Culebra, we are puzzled by the negative reviews of Tamarindo. There are 2 things to remember about accomodations on this quiet, rural island: 1) the options of where to stay are limited and 2) the typical resort type hotels are rare. Most decent places charge $200/night because they can. Culebra is for people who need peace and quiet, want to unwind and clear their mind at the beach, and can live in comfortable but not luxurious resort type hotels. Tamarindo Estates is efficiently and very well run. We stayed in a 1 bedroom cottage that was well kept, comfortable, very clean, and had a lovely deck facing the ocean. All the cottages at Tamarindo should afford great views. There is a lovely pool right on the ocean and you are steps away from Tamarindo beach. True, you will not be brought a stack of clean towels nor will your sheets be changed daily. There is no room service or a luxurious on site spa. However, all you have to do is make a quick call to request new linens, and towels. (There is apparently a restaurant on site, but we never used it). We cooked simple meals in our kitchen, which was well equipped. There was no oven, but a bbq grill with charcoal is provided on the deck on which you can grill to your heart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s content. There are a few things that Tamarindo can easily upgrade that would improve the experience -- they could provide better bed sheets and linens, and use real and not tacky plastic flower arrangements. To us, these were minor issues given the lovely surroundings and views and pretty comfortable accommodations. (Another plus is that Tamarindo, because it is off the main road and not in town) seems to lack those famous roosters that people have complained about keeping them awake. However if you stay in town (see our review of Casita Linda, which we do not recommend, particularly for people in our 30-40 year old demographic) the roosters will keep you awake most of the night.

Since it is located on a 60 acre estate right next to the ocean, it makes for a fantastic view from the front porch. The website was deceiving though, because we expected the cottages to be right on the beach when in actuality they are located up a hill a few hundred yards from the beach with access only from the road. We were there during the week, and there did not seem to be any other guests, so it was very quiet. But I think that if the cottages were full, it would not be quiet at all because the cottages are located so close together. I was not too impressed with the rooms. There is an old window a/c unit in the bedroom that blew directly on the bed, so when it was on, it was freezing, but when it cut off, it got hot. The bedroom is in the back of the cottage, so opening the windows would have been warm. We were given 4 towels to start, and it seemed to be a problem to request clean ones when we had used the other ones at the beach. The beach at Tamarindo is reportedly best for snorkeling, certainly not a good beach for swimming or lounging. Flamenco beach (one of the world's top beaches) is located only 5 minutes down the road, so it is best to do your swimming there. Overall, if a view is all that matters to you, then Tamarindo Estates is the place to stay, but since the cost is more than other places in Culebra, I would have expected more from the accommodations.
