There was hair and possible mice droppings on the sink, and the smoke alarm was gone, leaving only wires exposed. I have a 6 month old, and there was no way my wife and I were going to stay.

When we arrived the price was $49. Even the clerk seemed apologetic at the misinformation. The room was dingy and in need of upgrades. The light from the hall shown in through the curtains so the room was never dark. I woke up in the middle of the night realizing I hadn't checked for bedbugs. Big Mistake. They were all over my pillow and sheets. Three days later I have over 2 dozen bites all over my body. When we went downstairs the night clerk said he didn't have the ability to give us a refund but the manager would be in by 8/9. He gave us another room to shower and let us use the hotel facilities to wash our clothes. The new room also had bedbugs. By the time we washed all our clothes and checked our luggage, it was 8:30 and the day clerk had arrived (who spoke very poor English), but no manager. We were finally told he wasn't getting in until 11. We needed to get on the road so we tried calling him and leaving a message, but we were never even told the manager's name. Based on previous reviews, I don't have much hope of resolving this simply. In all this time I noticed that the continental breakfast was not restocked once in the 3 hours it was supposed to be available, with only one slice of bread available as early as 6:30 (breakfast was from 6-9), even though I saw granola bars, etc in the back while we did our laundry.

I realized before I even walked in that this wasn't going to be such a great place, because the man behind the desk was looking at me through a window...

He booked through their web-site which is typically a little more friendly and because he stayed a few months prior for business and had an alright experience for the price. Our situation changed and we had to bring our dog with us so we had to cancel our reservation two days prior to checking in. Two days prior during a busy Memorial day weekend. Typically Day's Inn takes dogs but this one doesn't. After a day wasted on the phone with a horrible receptionist who refused to put us through to a manager and a manager, Andy, who refused to call us even though we requested several times, we are still being told that the charges won't be dropped. My husband explained that unfortunately the situation changed which isn't typical and a two day notice should be sufficient as it is with most hotels. And by the way, we never even received a confirmation number or e-mail which is also very suspicious. He's had to call corporate, has been tossed back and forth, and has been nothing but professional, but they are now saying they will charge our card for all four days when originally we were told we would be charged for one. Finally we called Day's Inn customer service headquarters and spoke with John and were told that because we had a contract we are not going to be let out of it and therefore does not indicate poor customer service, that the original quote of being charged only for one day was the hotel mispeaking, and that he has no problems with it reflecting poorly on Day's Inn. Now, you would think in order to keep a customer for the future they would be willing to extend some good customer service but this hotel, the manager Andy, and Day's Inn customer service must have a bad track record and must really fear the empty room so they are trying to get money any way they can-by taking it from people who aren't even using their service. How this is different from theft I do not know. Unfortunately for all Day's Inn we will never stay at one again. We go to Indianapolis often for business and they have lost us as future customers. In a service industry, which my husband and I are both in, there should be some flexibility for the customer if you want them to return and spread the good word about their business. But I guess to Day's Inn policy is more important than people and service. I cannot urge people strongly enough to stay far away from this place. We stay at a lot of hotels throughout the year and this is by far the worst we have ever been treated. I have never heard of a manager who refuses to call customers to smooth over an issue or a customer service representative who is okay with ripping people off to the tune of $500.

Very cheap with one of the coupons from the welcome centre, but not worth it. The list of problems goes on and on. 1. the bathtub was broken on the bottom, and looked like it had been patched with something. the patch wasn't solid, so we could not shower as it looked like it wasn't at all hygenic, and bacteria etc. were likely present in the crack 2. there was mucous from someones nose on the wall near the sink 3. the toilet had dried feces on the inside of the bowl, so it was apparent that it had not been cleaned. There was also what appeared to be feces smears on the wall beside the toilet. 4. the air conditioner in the room was not working enough to actually cool the room off. it was so hot and stuffy in the morning that we just opened the door to get some air once we were dressed. We didn't feel well we were so hot and the air was so stale in the room. 5. the free daybreak breakfast had no fresh fruit (as guaranteed by the president on the web page), to make tea we had to heat water in a dirty microwave in styrofoam cups (health practitioners tell you not to heat things in styrofoam), the pastries consisted of a few pre-packaged sugar donuts. we chose to eat our breakfast elsewhere. 6. when I informed the front desk of our complaints he wrote some of them down, and then just stood and looked at me. no other comments or apologies were made. I emailed a compaint to days inn when I got home, and was told to wait and the hotel would contact me directly to resolve the situation. When I didn't hear from the hotel, I contacted the phone number they gave me in the email, and was told they would mail me a cheque for half of the cost of the nights stay. The room wasn't even worth half what I paid for it however. This is the second time I've had a problem with a days inn that I've directed to customer service. The first time a hotel charged me twice for the same night. It took several months of dealing with the hotel directly to get them to reverse the charge. The days inn head office would not help me because the hotels are all independently owned and operated. I've had enough of this chain, and will never stay at one again. If I pull into a chain hotels parking lot I expect a basic level of service and cleanliness.
