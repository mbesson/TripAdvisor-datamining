{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great, affordable style at the Storrier We stayed at the Storrier on Nov 22-23, 2008. We booked directly with the hotel for a petite studio for 140 AUS/ 98 US per night, and were very happy with our decision. We took the Skybus from the airport, which was great because it dropped us right in front of the hotel, but the place is really close to the King's Cross subway station but a little tricky to find, especially if you are jetlagged! The room was tiny but well appointed and pristine. Although it was so small, it felt luxurious anyway because they really got it right with the details. The bed was comfy and the bathroom very clean. There's a minibar plus a microwave and plates, glassses, and cutlery, and a small table, so if you want, you can dine in. I was pleasantly surprised with the kitchen stuff and the other amenities, which included Molton Brown bath products. There's also a large Storrier print (duh) on the wall and a matching wine bottle. The staff was friendly and helpful too ( especially one desk clerk who printed off directions for us). Points off for the shower (there's no door or separator, just a curtain so things get messy) and the bathroom is really really small. It can get pretty noisy at night and in the early morning, but it was charming to hear birds (as well as trucks) at 8 AM. Unfortunately, we didn't get to see the roofdeck because it was booked for a private function one night and it was rainy the next night. They have a restaurant, The Red Belly, but we ended up eating at a great casual Japanese restaurant across the street from King's Cross station. The location has its pros and cons - it's a young, cool neighborhood with loads of bars and restaurants and really lively on Saturday night (the hotel is right by a dance club). It's about 20 minutes' walking distance from the harbor, if you don't get lost, and right by the subway, which takes you everywhere. Problem is, the subway isn't as frequent as other big cities, so it can take up to 45 minutes to an hour to get to the Rocks or the Circular Quay if you are unlucky. We didn't mind it so much, but if you're keen in being close to the sights, the Storrier may not be for you. We were extremely satisfied with it, though - they used every inch of space wisely and include everything you need in the room. What else can you ask for?", "Date": "Nov 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR432654161", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "PT1976"}, {"Content": "Great location, minor problem but enjoyable stay.... We stayed 4 nights at this hotel. We loved the location of the hotel. Easy access to city rail and it is the middle op hip neighbourhood with lots great restaurants, delli kind food stores. In the hotel room there is kitchenette with everything you need to cook breakfast or warm up delicious food from local dellis. The bed is comfy and we had inner courtyard room without nice view but very quiet. Rooms are on smaller side but not so small as mentioned in the earlier reviews. The bathroom was indeed quite small but we managed to shower and shave there;) The hotel staff is very friendlyThe only problem we had was mini bar charges incuring twice for the things we did not take. But on the other hand, reception corrected that right away.I did not like though the fact that they charge you for WIFI. Come on, it is 21st age, even some big business chain hotels changing their policy and provide internet free of charge ( or as a part of their total service) and to my opinion, smaller, boutique hotels really should have it available without any extra cost.I would definately return to this hotel if WIFI is free of charge. This is actually the only reason I am not giving excellent rate for this hotel", "Date": "Oct 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR804231560", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Arturas"}, {"Content": "Dodgy alley I stayed at the Storrier for 4 nights in October. There are good and bad points about the hotel. The good: the hotel itself is very nice. The rooms were a little small, nice and clean. The interior decor is very funky. There are heaps of restaurants, bars and nightlife nearby. The Kings Cross subway station is only a minute walk away.The bad: To get to the hotel you have to walk either along an alley or a past a dodgy street area. It may be called Potts Point, but the other side of the street is Kings Cross. It didn't feel very safe walking to the hotel late at night. The Holiday Inn Potts Point is about 50m away, but it's a very important 50m. It felt a lot safer walking to the Holiday Inn, we would walk to the Holiday Inn and the catch a taxi for the last 50m to the hotel door.", "Date": "Oct 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR555074991", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "aussie_h"}, {"Content": "Disappointing but not terrible WE stayed three nights in a Petite Studio at $140 a night, which was a reasonable price comparatively. The room was very small, which we expected, and stylishly furnished. We found the staff to be very efficient and friendly.On the down side, the worst thing about the hotel was the area. Not being from Sydney, we didn't realise Potts Point (or Kings Cross) is as bad as it really is. The hotel is smack in the middle of the red light district and, although we like some urban grunge, the drug activity is scary and right in your face. We didn't feel safe walking around after dark. The second major complaint we had was the shower. It's hard to believe a hotel could have such a poor hot water system. In the end, I only used the hot tap for showering and the temperature alternated between hot and freezing cold. My partner didn't have any luck either.There were a few other disappointments worth mentioning. 1) There was a black pillow on our bed which was filthy dirty. I put it aside so it could be changed with the other linen but the next day it appeared again on our bed- just as dirty.2) Our room was on the ground floor and quite noisy. We got woken up, not just by outside noise, but noise from the lobby and corridor (like people vacuuming outside our door early in the morning).All of that said, our stay was okay and not terrible. THe price was quite reasonable compared to others we looked at. We did look at moving hotel but there was no vacancy where we wanted, so in the end we decided it was easier to stay.", "Date": "Aug 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR196082768", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "ashgirlMelbourne"}, {"Content": "Fantastic We recently stayed in Sydney at The Storrier and found it to be one of the best Hotels we've stayed at. We live in a regional area and are known for our friendliness so when staying at the Storrier we found it was like staying at a Hotel at home.Im jealous though, the rooms were better than my own bedroom. Staff were great and very helpful especially allowing us to leavew our car earlier than check-in time so we could relax and see the sites of the city without woorying about the car. Great access to buses, taxis, trains and walking distance to shops and restaurants. Will definetly recommend it and would love to stay again.

The reception staff were very friendly too. Nothing was too much trouble.I had breakfast every morning at the hotel's restaurant Red Belly and dinner there a couple of times too.

They were having problems with their reservation system on line, but I was able to email the reservations desk and make the reservation. I had read so many good reviews about the hotel that I was really looking forward to my visit. I actually liked the location as it is close to many other hotels and restaurants and the Potts Point area is lovely and Kings Cross very interesting. My biggest problem was that the website indicated the rooms 'come with high speed internet access'. I discovered that the rooms have access available but the cost was $10/hour, $20 for 4 hours or $30/day. I did complain to the front desk and they said that they were aware that the website said this but that the internet was provided by an outside server and they had no control over the cost. The cost was added to my bill through the hotel, so I wondered about this. I wrote an email to the hotel while I was there reiterating my objection and did not receive a response. This really coloured my impression of the hotel. I didn't mind so much that the room was very tiny as it was in the back of the hotel and pretty quiet, or that 2 lightbulbs were burned out, or even that the sink was leaking all over the floor, as these issues were addressed immediately. I found the staff to be extremely friendly and helpful, in all respects, except for the internet issue. Most hotels do seem to include this free of charge, and I wouldn't have objected if the website did not suggest that it was free. As long as you are prepared for the extra cost and can get a good deal, this is a pretty fair place to stay I reckon, but there are many other hotels in the same area where internet access is free.", "Date": "Apr 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR191540986", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "peleer"}, {"Content": "Inner city oasis - Charm and Cheer       Bed - queen size  very comfy", "Date": "Apr 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR539572333", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "40ishcouple"}, {"Content": "7th Heaven Oh my god. What a slice of heaven in the middle of the cross. The hotel is beautiful, art deco building with fabulous good sized rooms all new amenities and brand new divine soft beds. There is a fabulous rooftop terrace with a great view perfect for a bottle of wine on a clear night. It was altogether perfect. We ended up there again after a horrible experience at The Kirketon nearby. We arrived and the staff remembered us and even the details of our trip. They upgraded our room and booked us into dinner at the restaurant. The food was wonderful as was the service.
