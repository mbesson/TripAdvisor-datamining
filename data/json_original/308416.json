{"Reviews": [{"Content": "My favorite hotel ever! I stayed here for 4 nights in late April with my 3 kids. It was my favorite hotel of all my trips. I stayed 2 nights at the Nikko Bali but the Taman Harum was the best. I had a villa which was spotless and I loved the open air shower. The grounds are a feast for the eyes. The staff was very friendly and it was no problem catching the free transportation to and from the hotel. The included breakfast was delicious and the restaurant was very cheap for other meals. The only area of opportunity I would say is that massages/activities were not readily available and would usually need to be prebooked at least 24 hours before. It is a great value for the money-and I will be back. Bali is amazing!!!", "Date": "Jun 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR476426270", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "jahmama"}, {"Content": "Ugh. Look elsewhere... As other reviewers have indicated, the exterior (gardens, pool and buildings) is delightful. Unfortunately, the attention to detail stops there. I was given a 2nd floor room on the side nearest the road. It looked nothing like the charming photos on the hotel's website. There was no mosquito netting and the bathroom was industrial looking. I had no private veranda, no view of the rice paddies or even the hotel gardens. The room had no windows, period. The closet doors were broken, the shower was cold, and there were no mattress pads on the bed. The website misrepresents the Taman Harum Cottages showing only the villa and only the view from the second floor of the villa. It does not show the drab and dreary rooms that face the villa.The website indicates each room comes with a hair dryer. This was not the case. I used my own but had to hold the plug in the socket with one hand because it would not stay in otherwise.The worst thing about the room I was in is that the bedroom shared a wall with the bathroom of the adjacent room. The upper part of this wall is constructed only of woven palm fronds and one piece of plywood, so when the neighbors get frisky in the shower it sounds like they are in your room.I checked out after one night because a) it was too far from Ubud, b) I didn't want to listen to the private life of my neighbors, c) I didn't want to spend any time AT ALL in the miserable room, and d) there are plenty of better places for less money available. I disagree with the others who say you get value for your money. I paid about $33 US at Taman Harum, then moved to Ketut's Place where I paid $23 US and had a much more enjoyable stay. Bottom line....look around. There are much better deals to be found, much nicer places to stay. Take a look at Madrigal Guesthouse or Ketut's Place. In the low season you don't need to book ahead. You can afford to look around until you find something that suits you.", "Date": "Apr 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR452737889", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "roadlesstakin"}, {"Content": "Loved the atmosphere       Pathway to villas", "Date": "Jan 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR504864080", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "AJayKL"}, {"Content": "Unassuming upon first impression but slowly grows on you My fiance and I booked into this quiet hotel in early august this year. On first impressions, it seemed dark and a bit too quiet, the outdoor bathroom looked a little dated as well.However, as we stayed longer, the cottages grew on us and the ultra-friendly staff always made us feel welcome. Each staff greeted us by name (something that even the top hotels like the Ritz may not be consistent at doing) everyday when we were there. The personal touch that they exuded in catering to our requests more than made up for the small room which we stayed in. On our last night there, we ordered some sandwiches for dinner. When it took longer than usual, the staff gave us some warm bread pieces to munch on so we won't be left too hungry. Talk about great service!We enjoyed everyday when we were there, especially the lush green padi fields just on the other side of the swimming pool complex. It was a pity we never got to swim and laze by the pool due to our shorttime there.The previous reviews which rated this hotel a '1' was a little unfair. While the hotel does look dark at night, the staff's warm attitude and welcoming atmosphere more than made up for it.", "Date": "Sep 1, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR447858206", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "opalz2"}, {"Content": "Friendly and down-to-earth We've just come back from Taman Harum. It was a great experience and we wish we had more time to stay a little longer (only 4d/3n). The standard garden view room in which we stayed was quite dingy, furniture and fittings a bit worn and run down, with the garden furniture neglected and water feature non-functional. The other rooms i.e. the villas looked newer and they were the ones with the fantastic views of the rice fields. However, as we did not spend that much time in the room we didn't bother to change it; and the friendliness of the staff, nice green settings (lots of plants/trees on the grounds) and down-to-earth minus-the-glitz close-to-the-locals environment made up for that. Also, it's location on the Mas-Ubud road was quite strategic for us, being near to art galleries and woodcarving in Mas, dances in Batubulan and food in Ubud. The free on-demand shuttle into Ubud provided by the hotel runs from 8am to 10pm and was very handy - didn't really need to book in advance or wait long, and they would drop anywhere in Ubud, and similarly for pickups which could be notified with a 15 min advance phone call). Didn't get much time to try out the activities at the hotel except the massage which was alright. Staff were very friendly and helpful, always ready to chat and we learnt a lot about culture and day-to-day life in Ubud through informal conversations with them (most conversant in English, although we perhaps got slightly more mileage being a little conversant in Malay). The on-site gallery was quite ordinary, and we found better deals and variety outside. Good value overall, somewhere in between 3 and 4 stars but closer to the higher.", "Date": "Aug 25, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR292186837", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "gwkchin"}, {"Content": "great Family place We went there with our 2 children this year, there were couples singles, families there. A very peaceful place, fantastic staff, like a village in itself. A very good place to stay in the Ubud area with a very friendly and fun staff. They are particularly solicitous of how you're doing. If you are into art, this is a wonderful place to get involved in a few classes. We took the batik painting class, which was great. My husband took the cooking class. They do classes for 1 person which is great. A free, on-demand shuttle whisks you to Ubud, 10 minutes away. They have a couple of cars to shuttle you back and forth to Ubud and this service was very reliable.Private island day tours, standard or customized, are easily arranged if you want to explore -- but you may never want to leave the grounds. One of the best value places in the Ubud area, in my recent experience.If you were looking to meet other single people this would not be the place. Even though the place was full when we were there we had the pool to ourselves most of the time and you would only see 1 or 2 other people around on other occasions. If you would like a beautiful tranquil place, that is a little different from any other hotel, I would recommend the Taman Harum cottages to anyone. In fact next time we go to Bali we will spend most of our time there and just a few days in Legian.Hope I was of some help", "Date": "Aug 21, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR698814308", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "michCalifornia"}, {"Content": "Escape from Mas Taman Harum promises a unique local experience on its website with daily activities and a shuttle service into Ubud on request. It is 10-15 minutes out of town in the well-known village of Mas. However once there, there is nothing to do other than sit disconsolately in your dark room, or take the shuttle to Ubud if it is running and then hope you can get it to bring you back again. The bad news started when the pick-up which was supposed to meet us at 12 noon was put back until well after 3.00, so having checked out of the previous hotel we had to sit there and wait for hours. When the driver arrived there was no apology just muttering about the heavy traffic - which was certainly true. By the time we got to Mas it was late in the afternoon and the day had passed. Inside the cottage which is a two-storey affair with a steep staircase and one bed up, one down, there were no screens on the windows which were made of solid wood, and the two or three lightbulb were maybe 20 watts. Of course there was no jug for hot water/tea/coffee. There was also no hot water in the mosquito-ridden bathroom, which they had not mentioned on the website. There was no desk or chair, nowhere to sit except on the bed (the mattress being ancient and shapeless) or outside in the garden, a lacklustre restaurant, almost no other guests and a creepy silence. There is no outside phone connection so all calls have to go through the main desk. There is nowhere to go out on the road, no other restaurants or entertainment, and although the proprietor and staff tried to be friendly - sort of - it was dingy, dark and depressing. But there was indeed a lovely terrace with a great ricefield view. We decided to escape as soon as possible and pay the cancellation fee. The website is completely misleading, and while it might be interesting for a day or two - there was in fact a big ceremony on in the nearby village on the night we were there but they didn't bother to mention it - any longer than that would be hard to imagine, and why would you go there when there are hundreds of great places at half the price in Ubud?", "Date": "Jul 24, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR120653946", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "Ann-de-Mot"}, {"Content": "Accommodation was dark and run down My family and I were looking forward to our short stay in Ubud but, unfortunately, our initial impression was tarnished due to the accommodation at Taman Harum Cottages.We booked the accommodation via their website and were impressed by the photos. In reality, though, the family cottage looked quite different and needs to be renovated. It seemed very run down, dark and a bit dirty. Not how we envisaged our stay to be in Ubud.We organised to have massages on the premises and would have to say that they were VERY average - even the massage room was unappealing.The other inconvenience was the location. The cottages are about 15 min's out of central Ubud which means you always need to rely on transport to get you into town.The only positive thing I have to say about Taman Harum is that the grounds were impeccable and the staff friendly enough.

What a unique place. We stayed in the Honeymoon Cottage for $48.00++ or $58.08 USD per night, including breakfast. The cottage had a living room with sunken conversation pit, kitchenette, bedroom, completely open air bathroom and a raised bale overlooking the rice fields and Mt. Agung (when there were no clouds) Breakfast, though not gourmet, was still satisfying. The pool was quite nice, also overlooking the rice field and volcano. As there is a Temple on the premises, offerings are made all day long, which only adds to the experience. The staff were very accommodating, and barly raised an eyebrow when my partner and I checked in. They also run a shuttle into Ubud until 10PM, which was quite convenient. For a relatively small fee, you can partake in wood-carving classes, batik making, etc. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, we were unable to take any of the classes offered. Though not a five-star resort by any stretch of the imagination, we both became enamoured with the place,and did not want to leave. During our trip, we stayed at the Bali Cliff Resort and the Hotel Imperial Bali, but the Taman Harum was by far the most interesting of the three places. They also have a restaurant which provides basic Indonesian food at very reasonable prices. All in all, we would definitely go back.Hope this is of some helpDan and Bob", "Date": "Sep 22, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR859566630", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Value for money       Another view of rice fields from balcony", "Date": "Aug 24, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR699654352", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Strabo"}, {"Content": "Could do with some TLC A small complex with rooms and cottages in a garden setting.However the complex was in need of some tender loving care as it was somewhat rundown.Expect charming, helpful and attentive staff, reasonable food in the small restaurant and all at a very reasonable price.Wel worth a visit but the price reflects the standard.", "Date": "Mar 29, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR285536601", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "A little disssapointed I wasn\u9225\u6a9b overly impressed with the Tuman Harum cottages as far as accommodation is concerned.
