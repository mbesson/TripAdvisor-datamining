Although parking at the road side was free, it was a bit full especially when it was night. The price for parking at the hotel was clearly stated as 5 Euros in the booking but the reception charged me 8 Euros instead even after I showed her the statement in the booking. The room was big with a King size bed, two bunkers, sofa, coffe table and cupborad. It was very clean and comfortable. But I do no tunderstand why there was no kettle for boiling water. The S-Bahn station is easy to find and reasonably close but may be a bit worrying to walk back alone in the night. Going to the ciyt by S-Bahn is also easy. Overall this is an excellent hotel having taken into account its price. I highly recommend it.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAlecsa Hotel,\u201d", "Author": "Elizabeth F Posted by an Easytobook.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR127865684", "Content": "The room and bathroom were very clean and spacious. However, we did not get a double bed, as described, but two single beds pushed together - complete with two single duvets. Additionally, I was disappointed that no shampoo was provided in the bathroom, and the towels were tiny! The staff were extremely polite and helpful, they allowed me to print off my plane tickets for free and even offered to send a parcel home after I left something in the room after checking out. I really couldn't fault their manner. One suggestion I have for the hotel is to decrease the price of the breakfast. It looked lovely, and I probably would have indulged in it, but 9 euros is more than 3 times what you would pay in the rest of Berlin for breakfast. Finally, for us the location was not ideal. It is probably a 10 -15 minute walk to the train station, and in the dark it is very difficult to find the hotel so I wouldn't recommend arriving after dark. It took around 45 minutes to get into the centre of town once on the train, but trains are only every 10 mins, and at night this reduces to every 30 mins. Obviously this would not be a problem for everyone, but if you want to experience some of Berlins nightlife then it is irritating. Additionally, the hotel is in a very residential area, with no shops or cafes, so if you do give the expensive breakfast a miss, you'll likely be very hungry by the time you get to the centre. Overall, the hotel was clean and good value for money once inside, and had wonderful staff, but I probably wouldn't stay here again as the location was not what we wanted for our trip to Berlin.", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Albertslund, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cvery good hotel\u201d", "Author": "runip", "ReviewID": "UR122423211", "Content": "I really liked my stay in this Hotel... I took it because it was so cheap. so i was positive surprised how good it was... large room. good bed, bathtub. lots of tv channels. balcony... the breakfast was almost perfect, staff was very nice... only thing that could have been better was the wifi, it cost 2 euro per day, but the signal on the 10th floor (where our room was) was very bad... but i could live without.. so that will not affect my positive experience at the hotel...

Just take a taxi which costs only 19 Euro and the whole trip takes only 15 minutes. The hotel offers warm and hospitable atmosphere. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Breakfast is servide in the nice and cozy room and is just perfect! Breakfast buffet is not icluded in the hotel bill by default, but it's worth 9 Euro per person! Location: to get to the nearest S-Bahn station you need just 5 min. German public transport system is excellent! Your can by 24-hour or 48-hours ticket in the automat on the station and use any kind of public transport in the city. Trip from our station to the center of the city (Hauptbahnhof Station) took 20 min. Internet connection: we missed a bit free WI-FI in the rooms (you need to by wi-fi access cards for it), there are 2 PCs with internet in the lobby with free access. Bar: hotel does not offer meal in the evening or diring the day, but you can have coffee, tea, some snacks.

I was quite shocked at this as having been to Berlin before I know how good their transport system is. I became quite worried that I had chosen to stay in the back of beyond with no links into the city centre! We took their advice and got a taxi to our hotel at a cost of 18 Euros. As soon as we arrived we were greeted by the young staff on reception and were made to feel very welcome. We had arrived early, before official check-in and only one of our rooms was ready, they said we were very welcome to go to that one and leave our luggage. We then decided to ask the question of how to get from the hotel to Berlin centre. There happened to be an S-Bahn (land train) station just 5 minutes walk from the hotel! This had a direct link to all the central stations and only took 15 mins. We were no longer worried. Our holiday was fantastic, the hotel was clean and very nicely decorated, the staff were friendly and the local area was lovely too. There is a supermarket, local cafe, a couple of pubs and a restaurant, 2 mins from the hotel, all of which we were made to feel extremely welcome. The only thing the hotel didn't have is tea and coffee making facilities in the room. They do have a 24 hour service in reception though at a cost of around 2 euro's a large cup. I would very much recommend this hotel to anyone who likes to experience the real Berlin, we had a brilliant time!", "Date": "November 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hinckley", "Title": "\u201cBig but dirty room\u201d", "Author": "SuperiorChimp3", "ReviewID": "UR16900140", "Content": "This hotel was very old and dirty. Our room was on the 7th floor and the lift was teeny tiny so when we had all our stuff and the buggy we couldnt breathe (we ended up going up seperatley) the room was very big and airy with floor length windows and we had a private balcony. The room had a big bed and lots of room for a travel cot plus 2 extra bunk beds (think we had been given a family room) . Unfortunately this room had a wooden floor which was filthy. i took my shoes off for about 10 mins and my feet were BLACK. Also when you opened the patio door the inside was all black and grimy so of course i couldnt let the baby play on the floor or anything, Yuck! The balcony floor for some reason was also blacky and grimy. The bathroom was ok but again wasnt the cleanest ive been in.

Stay in an hotel in the centre of Berlin, or one on the outskirts. Like for like an hotel in the thick of things is expensive especially in Berlin. Hotels on the fringe are cheaper if you see my point. We visited Berlin for the first time last May bank holiday weekend. Of course we wanted a decent hotel, but I admit I wasn't sure that we would be happy with The Alecsa Hotel, as it was so far from the hubub. We couldn't have picked a better place to stay. The S Bahn takes 20 mins the the main station (I timed it) or 15 mins to the Zoo. The German transport system is beautiful and tuned to perfection. Consequently we didn't have to wait long for the S Bahn. Incidentally, we bought a 48 hr ticket for all forms of transport for 16 euros. So our travel costs worked out very low. We booked the hotel direct via e-mail. I found this no problem and they were able to answer all our queries promptly and efficiently. All the staff were very friendly and helpful and spoke good English. When we came back in the late evening the porter was on duty and served tea and coffee, or drinks from the bar with a smile. Very welcoming after a long day of sightseeing. We booked a double room, which was very comfortable. The bathroom was clean, the room was ok. In fact, this is one area that could be improved upon. The decor was pleasing, and our room was light and spacious. The hotel is situated in what I would describe a peacful select suburb. We felt safe walking to the S bahn station (about 4 mins walk from the hotel.) The hotel would not have won any awards for architectural design. It was a typically styled 70s block. But, you can't have everything. On the whole, superb customer service. If you want a reasonablely priced good standard hotel, with frendly staff in a nice area in Berlin and don't mind a 20min journey to the centre then The Alecsa is a great hotel.", "Date": "May 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hamburg, Germany", "Title": "\u201cA hotel for misers\u201d", "Author": "HHBenfica", "ReviewID": "UR15202255", "Content": "The hotel is in the near from the Olympia Stadium Berlin(Hertha BSC) and the open air place \"Waldb\u00fchne\".
