We needed to stay close to this neighoborhood and thus arrived without reservations which was fine. The decor is outdated but the hotel is clean, the staff was friendly and they have internet access in the lobby for 25 pesos an hour. They also have a restaurant which was a bit overpriced for the area but turned out to be convenient since they have room service. The rooms have color television with basic cable and remote control and the bathroom had a clean bathtub. It is one block from the metro stop Hidalgo. I paid about $63 US dollars each night for three nights from Friday night to Sunday. The hotel is six stories. We were given a room next to the elevator which should be avoided in any hotel. Some friends were given a room for the same price accross from us which had a seperate second TV/sitting area! On the second night at the hotel my girlfriend got really sick (not related to the hotel or the trip). We were really worried and scarred that she might need to be hospitalized. She was in agonizing pain and then I noticed that the hotel offered medical services. I called the front desk and they connected me to a clinic. I spoke to a nurse who also had me talk to a Doctor. For 500 pesos (about $50 U.S. dollars) they came to the hotel room. I was told that the bill would be higher if they had to administer any medications. The Doctor and the nurse were very professional, knowledgeable and friendly. They told me they would arrive in 15 minutes and they did. The Doctor correctly diagnosed my girlfriend and the nurse administered two shots which almost immediately took away her pain (one was a pain reliever and one was an antibiotic for her condition). The bill turned out to be $180 dollars due to the medications but worth it. If she needed to, they told me they could also arrange for her to get an ultrasound at the hotel! If she needed to be taken to the hospital then they would have arranged for that. Fortunately she responded well to the shots and the Doctor also gave her prescription medications which were effective. I should also mention that we are two women and this did not seem to be an issue with the hotel staff, the doctor or the nurse. Thus, I am rating this hotel as Excellent since I am very grateful for their services, in addition to it being reasonably priced, clean, nice, and not far from the Zocalo. We walked to our hotel from the Zocalo in about 15-20 minutes and I am a slow walker!", "Date": "Mar 29, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR931173399", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Convenient, Quiet, Inexpensive I have stayed at the Hotel Jena a few times over the last few years, and have always found it to be more than acceptable. The rooms are clean, the place is generally quiet, and it is conveniently located. It is quite close to Metro Hidlago, and within walking distance of Alemeda Park, the Monument to the Revolution, and the National Lottery Building (plus lots of other places). BTW, it is close to one of my favorite places to eat in all of Mexico City - Tacos al Caminero. As you leave the Hotel Jena, head towards the Monument to the Revolution. Walk to the Monument, and once you get there head to the left. You'll find Tacos al Caminero nearby. In any case, ask at the hotel if these directions don't make sense. BTW, most of the staff don't speak English too well, so a little Spanish helps. The restaurant at the Hotel Jena is ok, although better options are nearby, including the previously mentioned Tacos al C. and there is are VIPS and Sandborns quite near by as well. Prices at the Hotel Jena have been around 40-50 dollars (US) per night in recent years, which is higher than some of the smaller hotels nearby, but must less than some of the more popular places in that area (Hotel Melia, for example). I have never made reservations and they always seem to have a room for me, but they certainly will take reservations. All in all a very pleasant place in a convenient and interesting location.", "Date": "Jan 31, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR669310919", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Buen trato pero mala ubicaci\u8d38n   showReview(5652491, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 21, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR802156833", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "yasming"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d252622-r21159722-Hotel_Jena-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "HotelID": "252622", "Price": "$66"}}
