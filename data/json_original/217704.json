I would definately stay here again the night before going on a cruise. We prepaid $10 per person for a shuttle to pick us up at the port and take us directly to Miami Airport which was a bad idea.

The reason we chose this hotel was because of the proximity to the port and for the free shuttle service to the hotel and to the pier. We were satisfied with this service. However, because the inn is literally right beside the airport, it gets to be a bit loud. Miami airport is a busy place and there are planes coming and going throughout the night. The room was average at best and I thought the bed wasn't too bad. My friend, however, woke up with a sore back. Furthermore, if free breakfast is a reason you are considering La Quinta, please reconsider. The continental breakfast (although not usually great anywhere you stay) is below standards with little variety, warm juice and weak coffee. Finally, La Quinta is located in the middle of nowhere. If you did not rent a car, expect to eat Bennigan's which is the only restaurant that is accessible by foot, unless you want to run across a 6 lane highway to get to Burger King. If you're not too picky about hotels, La Quinta is probably acceptable for a short stay before your cruise, but don't expect anything fancy, especially for what you pay. Personally, I would pick something closer to downtown like the Hilton, and pay your ten dollar fare to taxi it to the pier. It's a bit more expensive (look for a sale), but a lot more comfortable. Note: If you plan on staying at La Quinta after your cruise, and you require transportation, La Quinta offers a shuttle back to the hotel for a price.

I was very pleased with this selection. We arrived on a Thursday night after a long drive down from Lakeland, FL. Were checked in promptly and courteously. Parking for our rental car was free. Our room was perfectly fine, two comfy beds, very clean room in all (although as other reviewers have said, the carpet could use a cleaning). Decent towels and good water pressure in the room, and the soap they provided smelled very nice. It was not a humongous room but it met our needs, not feeling cramped. The TV was newer and nice. Yes, we could hear the planes take off - frequently - but it was not deafening or bothersome, more like a background noise, and it was not a problem for us, even for my husband who is a very light sleeper. The breakfasts were fine. Nothing exotic but we didn't go away hungry. We had hard boiled eggs, cereal, coffee, bagels/cream cheese, fresh fruit, and juice. There was also a waffle machine but as we are hard core Vermonters we refuse to eat waffles or pancakes without 100% real maple syrup which of course they didn't have... so we can't say if the waffles were good or not. They have a very tiny \"gym\", inclusive of one treadmill, one elliptical, one recumbent bike. I did a workout on each machine - no problems although one of the pedals on the bike was partially broken. They also did not have any cleaning solution/towels located in the gym area, which was a nuisance. But it was nice to have that equipment available nonetheless. Our daughter enjoyed swimming in the pool which was nicely maintained. We had dinner one night at the next door Bennigan's and while our food was okay, service was indeed VERRRRRY SLOOOOOOOW and they do see fit to add a 15% tip to the bill - which in my opinion is stupid and they ripped themselves off because I usually tip a minimum of 20%. One downside was the airport shuttle, we returned our rental car on a Friday afternoon and waited quite a while at the airport for the shuttle to pick us up. Free, yes, but a PITA. However, one great spot was the free cruise port shuttle on Saturday AM - prompt, courteous service delivered on a giant comfy tour bus, we thought that was great. Strangely, we could not sign up for this until Friday afternoon - I was told Thursday night and Friday morning that we needed to check back after noon on Friday to sign up for Saturday's shuttle. Strange. One thing I did find peculiar was that at check in, the desk person told us to be sure NOT to order from the flyers under the door/in the hallway... scam artists. I found it unsettling that whatever sort of shady characters are allowed free reign of the hotel grounds to deliver these papers. We were not bothered by anyone... I don't understand why the hotel doesn't work harder to prevent those companies from getting in though. On Saturday morning, I realized I'd forgotten to pack my shipping tape (which I use to secure the cruise line luggage tags). Although the lobby area was mobbed with cruisers the desk staff person was kind enough to let me borrow their stapler, take it back to our room to staple the tags on. In all I would most definitely stay here again pre-cruise. Not perfect but definitely has the basic amenities and comfort required for a brief stay in the Miami area - at a much better price point than any other comparable hotel.", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Georgia", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel!\u201d", "Author": "kydd04", "ReviewID": "UR125296991", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel 2 days prior to my cruise and had a great time! hotel offers free airport shuttle and transportation to and from Miami port, rooms are clean wireless internet works great, also has a pool and free continental breakfast.", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Antonio, Texas", "Title": "\u201cRude front desk\u201d", "Author": "Texasgirlontheroad", "ReviewID": "UR125204115", "Content": "My husband and I checked into this La Quinta with our corgi, Sailor, and were put on the fourth floor, nice room and very spacious.

So beforehand, I mailed my \"non-flyables\" sun blocks, shampoos, and large liquids I could not take on a plane. The front desk had my package when I got there. So first, the shuttle. We used the courtesy phone at the airport and had maybe a 20 minute wait. Not bad! I also called at noon that day to reserve a spot on the shuttle to the port the next day as per a suggestion here on another review. Next, check in. Took about 5 minutes. The front desk girls were very friendly. If you are using a AAA discount take your card. They do ask for it. We were on the 2nd floor. Room was very clean and fresh smelling as was the bathroom. A/C had the room nice and cool and the beds were really comfy. Loved the soft comforters on them. The A/C made enough \"white noise\" that the airplanes were a non issue. There was a soda machine down the hall by the elevators, also an ice machine. We did not use the pool. Dinner we went across the parking lot to Bennigans. Now since the gratuities are built into your check is probably why the service is so/so. We did have a little bit of a wait. We had nowhere to be though. I can say our food was very good. I had the appetizer sampler and my daughter had a bacon cheese burger w/fries. Portions were big and it was delicious. We did get the pizza flyers under our door, looked over them and the prices were very reasonable. I think we paid about $35 at Bennigans, that was our 2 meals, sodas w/refills plus tip. Breakfast the next morning was adequate. Hey, its free! Waffles you make yourself, cold cereals, fruit, yogurts, bagels and breads, boiled eggs and instant oatmeal. Coffee/tea, milks and juices. Fine to tide you over. Check out was easy. They slipped the bill under your door in the morning and you just called the front desk if the bill is as its suppose to be..

We were attracted by the free airport shuttle and the free shuttle to the cruise port. Overall we found this hotel offered good value. There were 10 of us (in 3 rooms, 6 adults & 4 children), so we saved quite a bit of money we would have otherwise spent on taxis or shuttles, and breakfast was also included. However, we did find that we got what we paid for with the free shuttles... When we arrived at the shuttle pick up at the airport my dad called the hotel and was told we had just missed the shuttle and the next would be along in approximately 20 minutes. We stood on the curb watching & waiting, with 4 wiggly kids and a heap of suitcases, car seats, strollers, etc. However, we waited over 45 minutes before the shuttle came back. We saw other hotel's shuttles come twice before we saw ours. And we were very disappointed when the shuttle driver passed us by, saying he was too full for us, but he'd be back soon. We waited AT LEAST another 30 minutes before he came back! Luckily we did get on that shuttle. And weren't we even more suprised to find the drive from the airport to the hotel took only 5 minutes. So we're not exactly sure why only 2 shuttles came in almost an hour and a half?! Once we got to the hotel, everything was ok. Luckily we were second in line for check in; others behind us waited a while. Everything was satisfactory in our rooms, beds & bathrooms were clean, beds comfortable. We had at least 6 different pizza delivery flyers under our door, which was slightly annoying, but not really a big deal. My husband and brother-in-law took the kids swimming, the pool was fine, but water was quite cold. We could hear planes taking off overhead, but were tired, so it didn't keep us awake and there weren't any during the night - the first one I heard in the morning was after 7am. The front desk staff were helpful. We wanted to go shopping for a few last minute things and they gave us some recomendations and helped us get a cab. Breakfast in the morning was good, there were quite a few options - cereals, waffles, toast, bagels, yogurt & fruit, hard boiled eggs, coffee, tea & juice. Breakfast was busy between 9-10 am, but most of us ate earlier and didn't find it too bad and my mom and I ate after 10 and there was still lots available and not too busy then either. We booked our shuttle to the port when we checked in and the first available time for our group was 11am. We were asked to be ready in the lobby 15 minutes early. We were, but the shuttle was about 20 minutes late, so that was quite a wait again, but we didn't have anything else to do anyway . We were still at the port with plenty of time. If we were travelling to Miami to stay more than 1 night, I wouldn't stay here. It was in an industrial area near the airport - nothing to do there, however if you want to be near the airport, this is a good choice.

The WiFi was free, breakfast was good, the price of the hotel was very good, the shuttle to the cruise port was free, and the hotel even had $10 vouchers that could be purchased to travel from the cruise port to the airport when the cruise ended.

The only issues I had was more of a security thing. The curtains of the outside type room did not close completely and the guests in the room next door were sort of hanging out on the shared balcony area. As a single female traveller it didn't really make me feel at ease. The location was ok if you have a car. There doesn't seem like its much to do in the immediate area. I was hoping for something a bit closer to the Dolphin Mall /Miami International Mall area but that was my fault for not really doing my homework.

It consisted of waffles, hard boiled eggs, toast, bagels, yogurts, 2 kinds of cereal, and 2 kinds of juice. There was some fresh fruit, but it was typically gone by the time we went down there. On the weekends, the breakfast is open until 10, but it is only open until 9 on the weekdays. There are not enough tables to eat at, so people are spilling into the lobby. The tables they do have are round, so it is impossible to put them together if you're in a group larger than 2. The cruise shuttle is great, especially since it is free (only one way). To get back to either MIA or La Quinta after your cruise, it is only $10 per person. This is significantly cheaper than calling a cab or paying for transfers through your cruise line.

We stayed at the La Quinta in Tillman's Corner over the Christmas holiday, and it had scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, biscuits, gravy, donuts, and danish. The Miami Airport East location has none of those--just hard boiled eggs (which I hate), cereal, bread, waffles, and packages of oatmeal. It's a shame that the breakfast offerings are not standardized throughout the chain. Also, we encountered several rude people in the very small breakfast area, including one man who refused to move from the toaster area, blocking everyone else from using it. It's not rocket science--put your bread in the toaster and step back so that others can use the other slots on the two toasters that are there. Also, guard your chairs with your life. My roommate got up to get something, and someone grabbed his chair without asking if were done with it. Also, we saw the same little girl on the sole computer in the business center every time we passed by. Based upon another post I made, readers should know that this is one of my pet peeves.

This is great because you can come in the night before, extend your vacation a day, and leave your car, virtually for free. Everybody wins.

But if you stay one night here you can leave your car for up to 7 days for FREE! On top of that they have a shuttle that takes you to the Port! You cant loose. The shuttle was early, & got us there in more than enough time. They also have a service via the hotel that will arrage for you to be picked up but we decided on a taxi back from the port. It seemed quicker for about the same amount. Checking into the hotel was quick and easy. We were given a nice room with 2 queen beds. Very clean, standard bathroom.

I did tons of research making sure which hotels have had reports of bed bugs and this one was the best deal in a decent location and the best part was: they have a free shuttle from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the port of miami. Unfortunately, I called for a shuttle and the phone just rang constantly and no one EVER picked up. Luckily my friend had a different flight and had taken a different shuttle from Ft. Lauderdale and was at the hotel when I called so she had me talk to the lady at the front desk on her cellphone. (Who was amazingly nice by the way). When the shuttle got to the airport the driver was on the complete opposite side from where all the passengers were standing and even though I was waving him down he did not stop and drove past me causing me to have to wait 45 minutes for a return trip. Not cool. Finally I got to the hotel and check-in didnt take too long even though I was last in line. Be sure to book your port shuttle when you check in! Its really important because the next morning is complete chaos. The hotel itself was clean enough. Nothing spectacular. Just do yourself a favor and dont look at the mattressess under the sheets or you'll gross yourself out. :) The sheets themselves were clean though luckily. (Being the germaphobe I am, I always bring my own sheets) I did my bed bug check (using a blow dryer, check the internet for directions, lol) it came out clean and we got settled in. Our remote didnt work but they replaced it immediately. Other then that, the room was pretty good. Black out curtains were perfect. There's literally nothing around the hotel except the highway and a Bennigans which is awesome because all the ones I know of had closed down so we went there for dinner. They recommend not eating at the places that put fliers under your door. And trust me, you will get some. We got about 8 of them. Just eat at Bennigans and call it a night. As for the continental breakfast.. It was crowded but the lines moved quickly. Nearly everyone there we later learned, was there for a cruise. They had cereal, fruit, a waffle maker!!, bagels, bread, etc. Pretty standard. It would've been awesome if they had lactose free milk but I guess you cant win em all. :) We checked in and signed up for the 12 o'clock port shuttle and we were the first on the list for that time. It was so very unorganized and chaotic that they never called our names out and we missed the shuttle leaving us to wait an hour I think for the next one. I was pretty angry seeing as how I had talked to the guy about the shuttle less than 10 minutes prior to finding out we missed it. He was super apologetic though at least. Overall, just be patient with the shuttles and you'll be fine. If youre looking for some night life, stay in SoBe.

The pre-cruise stay was fine. I arrived much later than expected due to a delay in my flight, and mom arrived first. Evy at the front desk was very helpful and allowed mom to check in without me (I had the credit card). They gave us a standard double rather than the superior king I had pre-booked, but said nothing about the change, so I had to take initiative to speak to the front desk the next morning and they adjusted the rate. Breakfast is quite substantial, and the transportation to the port (the primary reason we booked) is well-handled. On the basis of just this night, I would have rated the hotel higher. We took the advice of previous reviewers and took a cab from the port to the hotel following disembarkation, so I can't speak to the efficiency of the post-cruise transportation for which there is a fee. We arrived at the hotel mid-morning, and by noon they were able to check us in, which was nice. There were 3 things that soured me on this hotel: (1) In this room the carpet was filthy, as the bottoms of my feet (and socks after I realized how dirty the carpet was and put them on) picked up the dirt; (2) The toilet paper roll had not been replaced and quickly ran out, nor was a spare roll available. When I called the front desk, they said I had to come down and get one (???!!!); (3) After checking out and returning home, later that day I developed itchy bites on my toes, the last vestiges of which are still there 1-1/2 weeks later. I don't think they were mosquito bites. We had to leave much too early for breakfast, so the overall value of that final night for the price was just not there. With regard to customer service, one of my pet peeves is being asked for a high rating on a survey. This hotel has permanent signs in several places saying that they strive to provide the highest service and if a post-stay survey is received to please rate them a 10. I don't know about you, but making a guest come down to the front desk for a roll of toilet paper doesn't strike me as a high level of service! Regarding dining, again at the recommendation of previous reviewers, we walked over to the Embassy Suites for an early dinner rather than to Bennigan's. (I don't think I'd do this in the dark.) Although the service was very good and the food was tasty (albeit swimming in butter), the prices were outrageously high. Portions are huge, so unless you are very hungry, I'd recommend splitting a salad and an entree between two people. Note: We tried calling the Cuban/American place to pick us up as suggested by one person, but they were short-staffed and could not provide transportation.

For the airport, all I had to do was return the car, take the rental car shuttle bus to the airport, and then catch the La Quinta bus back to the hotel. For the port shuttle, you MUST tell them when you check in that you need a shuttle to the port. They're familiar with all the regular cruise schedules and will get you to the port in plenty of time. As far as the hotel, the public areas and rooms were well maintained and comfortable. They include a free breakfast too, so that was a real money saver. The hotel is not in a particulary attractive area and is pretty much wedged in between a number of highway ramps and access roads, but that's what you get at airport hotels.

Included in the hotel rate is a free airport shuttle, free continental breakfast (including fresh waffles, cereals, fruit, yogurt, toast, bagels, muffins, fresh fruit, coffee, juice, etc.), and most importantly: free shuttle from the hotel to the cruise ship AND the ability to leave your car parked on the hotel property for FREE for up to a week if you stayed at the hotel. This deal absolutely could not be beat. Regarding the hotel itself: PROS: --Comfortable, updated, super clean, spacious rooms (see cons also). --Outdoor swimming pool (nice to unwind pre-cruise after long flight/drive). --Friendly, patient, accomodating staff (see cons below). --Good selection for continental breakfast and staff member quickly cleaning all tables and replenishing food selection. ---Free shuttle to cruise ship was fairly well organized and very punctual. CONS: --Room had that distinct \"this is NOT a non-smoking room\" smell. But this was my fault as I had not specified in the booking and the hotel was sold-out. --Front desk was completely under-staffed during check-in. One employee was responsible for checking in a line about 10-20 people long, directing housekeeping staff via walkie-talkie, accepting deliveries from vendors, answering the switchboard phone, answering questions from current guests walking up to the counter, and booking day tours. As ridiculous as this sounds (hotel management, please give this girl a break), the employee performing these tasks (Ana I believe) could not have been more pleasant, professional, courteous and accomodating. She worked as quickly as she could and everyone in line could see that it was beyond her control, so luckily there were no tempers flaring. --The hotel allows local \"restaurants\" (I say this sarcastically) to deliver menus under the room doors in the evenings. These menus (many of which look suspiciously similar to one another), tout the fact that they deliver. We assumed this was with the hotel's blessing as six to ten of these so-called menus were slid under our doors over the course of an hour or two. So we ordered a pizza. This 'large' pizza was about the size of a small dinner plate and we were charged a ridiculous amount of money for it (approximately $20 including tip). The flavor was non-existant and the crust was barely cooked. I spoke to another guest who said they called the front desk and asked about these menus before ordering (lesson learned for me) and they were told the hotel does not recommend ordering from these establishments. This is something the guests should know. The hotel should either 1.) prevent unauthorized distribution of these menus or 2.) notify guests at check-in that they do not recommend ordering from them. At the very least this should be noted in the hotel information binder in the rooms. ---Dinner options are limited. There is a Bennigan's right next door. However, the Bennigan's chain has closed. This is apparently one of only two left open in the country as they were owned by a franchisee. Unfortunately, it shows. The wait staff could not speak English (I am bilingual and could not get my point across in English or Spanish), the cleanliness was NOT acceptable, and the food was a cheap imitation of what I remember as Bennigan's food (which doesn't say much). Unfortunately, if you don't have a car, there isn't much other choice. If I had to do it all over again, I'd order from Pizza Hut, Domino's, or Papa John's online. At least you know what you're getting. ---Location is literally on the perimeter of the airport. When using the pool, you will be able to waive to the people's faces you can see on the plane as they are so close. As a result, holding a conversation is next to impossible. And they take off about once every other minute. This fact doesn't bother me personally, but it may bother some. However -- the rooms are pretty well sound-proofed and I could barely hear them at night. Overall, the pros of this hotel far outweighed the cons. Every place has some areas they can improve upon. However, the relatively low price, comfortable, updated rooms, and cruise-related bonuses that are included in the rate make it definitely worthwhile.

But what really impressed me with this hotel was the response that I received after I did a online survey giving my overall experience and recommendations: 'First and foremost please accept my sincere apologies for the inconvenience you received during your stay, and for not receiving the proper services you surely deserve. I want to thank you for your suggestions on the breakfast items and I would like to apologize for the lack of variety with the fruits. I will be sure to look into that issue myself. I would also like to thank you for giving me your perspective on our shuttle service. You make very valid points and I will make sure to make some improvements in that area. At this time I would like to offer you 10% off your room rate as a token of my appreciation. I have refunded the MasterCard ending in .....in the amount of $ 12.11. You should see a credit to your account within 2-3 business days. I know this does not justify any discomforts you may have experienced, but I do hope you can accept this as a good faith gesture in our part. If you are in the area again I do hope you can stay with us and give us a second chance to make things right. Again, my apologies, and thank you for letting me know of our shortcomings so I may rectify the issues.\" It wasn't that my hotel stay was horrible and the few complaints I had were about simple things but the fact that they took my survey and my comments to such an extent that they refunded 10% off my room rate back to me really impressed me to an extent that I would stay at this hotel again if I am ever back in Miami for a cruise.

Although many people were taking the free shuttle to the docks, our ride was right on time, and we enjoyed the trip, getting to see a little of Miami. Be sure to make a reservation for the shuttle the night before! Two of us stayed at La Quinta for one night after the cruise, while the other two chose a Days Inn (NOT a good choice). Note that there is no free shuttle from the port to the hotel. Again, our room was clean but run-down. We had rented a car for sightseeing and so did not need the free shuttle back to the airport. There is a computer and printer in the lobby that I used for flight check-in at a small cost. I later found out from the front desk that I could have done that for free, but there were no signs at the computer indicating that service (annoying).

However, this was the very first time we have had to pay extra to park our car there because our cruise was more than 7 days which has now become the maximum FREE car parking length allowed. Last year we had left our car parked in the lot there for THREE full weeks and there was no extra charge. Beyond the free seven days the parking charge is now $5. per day. Still a good deal, but not the GREAT deal we have experienced at La Quinta East in the past! We were fortunate to arrive at the hotel about 1:30 pm and there was no one in line at reception in front of us. Later in the afternoon I happened to walk by and the queue at the front desk was several layers deep and there were still only just the two women at reception who had been on duty when we checked in earlier. We felt very fortunate to have been able to register quickly when we arrived and were the very first names on the list for the earliest complimentary van to our cruise ship at the port the next morning. DO ask to be placed on the shuttle list for the port as you are registering as there is a limited number of seats available for each shuttle run. We booked one of the less expensive rooms with two beds near the front of the hotel on the 3rd floor. We have had the larger deluxe room in the past which has a fridge and a king sized bed, but his time we were using La Quinta points to pay for most of our room charges and the smaller was completely adequate for our one night pre-cruise stay. I spent the afternoon reading out by their very pleasant pool area while my husband watched sports upstairs in our room. We got up early the next morning and there was still plenty of room in the breakfast room downstairs - but not for long! We found the complimentary breakfast quite adequate and a great way to start our vacation! DH enjoys the make-your-own waffle station and I just had my usual oatmeal and a banana plus tea or coffee and juice. When we returned on a flight from Europe 19 days later we found the La Quinta East van waiting for passengers outside the 2nd floor of the airport above the baggage claim area with absolutely no need to call for the van.

The motel front desk is severely under-staffed and needs more help there. The motel does have a FREE airport shuttle and also provides a FREE shuttle to the Port of Miami. We used both as we had a Trans-Atlantic cruise to get to. Parking in their parking lot is FREE, but ONLY for a period of 7 days. Beyond 7 days, you must pay $5 per day for parking. The parking lot does have cameras and security. We left our car there for a period of about 17 days, without incident. The room we were given which was 2 Queen beds was a small room, but the room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s condition was clean and orderly. The TV could have sat higher up, though.

Originally we chose Regency Airport Hotel Miami and were very disappointed. We saw a add on a Miami tv channel and I breifly remembered reading reviews so we cancelled our after cruise booking and booked at La Quinta. Firstly, we saw no bugs. This is a biggy for me, the last thing I want to do after a vacation is fumigare our luggage. The pool was nice and I enjoyed sitting out watching the planes come off the runway. That being said if you don't want to hear them 24/7 this is not the hotel for you. The breakfast was basic, make your own waffles, toast, muffin or cold cereal. On the second day fresh fruit was aslo available. The rooms were basic, nothing fancy, but the beds were comfortable. We found that the value was in having free airport shuttle ( $25 for a cab) and free port miami shuttle ( again $25.00 for a cab) , the convience of having breakfast there ( a $30 value for our family of 3) The room paid for itself. However every time we asked for something we were referred to go to the hotel next to us ( Embassy Suites) . When we walked over to this hotel we were blown away! The concierge told us that should we want a room go to hotwire and put a bid in as they have ppl staying there for $80 a night all the time, we will do this the next time we are in Miami!!!) Lastly, if your a avid non smoker, don't go to this hotel. Our daughter is a severe asthmatic and we had to check out early because someone was smoking on our floor (both nights) and would leave their door open to the hallway. Our daughter was congested and we had to leave. When we told them at the Front Desk the girl said it happens often and there is nothing they can do about it.

That was a mistake! The room had an awful stale musty odor, the T.V didn't work so I called the front desk only to be told that I needed to turn it off & on which didn't work I was then told to make sure the game system that they have was unplugged and that also didn't work. They still offered to send no one so I gave up and began taking everything off the tv (wires) and replacing them again, apparently one was loose because I got it working. UGH! The continental breakfast was ok (the waitress that refilled and cleaned up was fantastic) but it was very crowded and not nearly enough seating. At breakfast (7 am) we spoke to the front desk to remind them we had a stroller, a scooter for my elderly grandmother and all 5 of us had 1 large piece of luggage and 1 carry on each in which they assured us that it was no problem to get a van large enough to transport all of us. When the van finally came (9:30am) we were told the small scooter now doesn't fit so we could leave it and my 93 yr. old grandmother until they would have an empty van at 1pm?! WHAT?! My mother was going to wait with the scooter and get brought to the boat at 1pm and we loaded all the luggage and the driver then said the stroller won't fit now either because he had another large family with all of their stuff so ours all can't fit. He said we would have to leave it also. Well I can't leave my mom with her luggage, a scooter, and a stroller so I did get a bit aggravated and just told the driver to unload ALL of our things and we will all just wait together for the 1 pm van. I did return back inside to ask the lady that seemed to be a supervisor what happened since we signed up to be shuttled the day before at check in and we also told them then what we had to be taken and was again told it wouldn't be a problem. All I could get from her was an I'm sorry, she did not even try to get us on the next van/bus. We ended up taking a taxi for $30 to the pier just to get out of the hotel.

So we took a cab which ended only costing a flat rate of $10 for all 5 of us, and it only took 5 minutes to get there. Should have done that in the first place. Anyways the rest of the stay was great. Check in was a breeze, the hotel served its purpose as we were staying the night before our cruise the next morning. The room was nice and the beds comfortable. The shuttle to the cruise ship was great (By far the best feature). We went to the Marlins game that night, and cab was $50 each way. I would stay away from the Bennigan's next door. I eat at Bennigan's all the time, and love the restaurant, but this one was dirty and had very poor service. No internet at this hotel, we were told to go to the Red Roof Inn next door. We should have used there shuttle too.", "Date": "May 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Bend, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cGreat place overnight before a cruise\u201d", "Author": "bambam26", "ReviewID": "UR15428000", "Content": "My husband and 2 boys stayed here the night before our cruise and it was perfect.

The reason I chose this hotel is its great location. we rent a car to visit Everglade nation park the day before the cruise. it is very close to many car rental companys, enterprise car rental office is within walking distance . we took the enterprise shuttle from the airport to rent the car upon arriving Miami at 10: 30pm . it only take 2 minute drive from enterprise office to the hotel. there is a good restaraunt right next door and its kitchen closed at 12am . if you arrive late in Miami and just want a one night stay . this hotel will be a good choice. We had a room on 4th floor for the first night. it was a horrible experience. The airplanes were flying over our room every 5 min from 6 am. we can hear the the thunderstorm very loud at night too.( I think the insulation under the roof is way too thin) I requested to switch to 2nd floor next morning. I had much better sleep the 2nd night but you can still hear the airplane noise though. the breakfast is quite good , waffle, bagle ,yogurt and boil eggs , juice coffee, milk cerel. the shuttle to the Miami port came right on time( 11; 15 am ). it is free and you have to register when you check in.", "Date": "April 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lansing, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for a one nighter\u201d", "Author": "JWestShuh", "ReviewID": "UR14454769", "Content": "My husband and I needed a clean hotel for one night prior to taking a cruise out of the Port of Miami.

I think we left around 10am if memory serves. We felt very safe parking and leaving our car for 9 days (with no extra charge of course). When we returned our car was just as we left it. The only item that dropped the rating from Excellent to Above Average was the plane noise. I knew it was basically next to the airport so I was expecting this - but it was a bit noisier than I had imagined - I don't do much traveling by air.
