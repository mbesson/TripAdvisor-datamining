The hotel is situated about two minutes walk from Paddington Station and is therefore convenient for both Tube and mainline services. It is a Regency style town house that has been converted into a hotel. I arrived in mid evening and was met by a male receptionist with poor spoken English and a rather long registration form. I was then advised that my room was on the fourth floor. It was fortunate that I was only carrying a small overnight bag as there are no lifts in the Ashley Hotel. There was no offer of a wake up call or provision of a daily paper for the morning. The hotel and the booking agent, Last Minute, make no mention of these matters in their descriptions of hotel amenities. I had also booked breakfast as part of the package but the hotel does not start serving until 7.30 am which was too late for me as my business in London called for an 8 am start at venue. The late start is mentioned neither by the hotel or the booking agent, Last Minute. As I left the hotel the following morning at 7am most of the surrounding hotels\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 breakfast rooms were in full swing. The receptionist gave me little further instruction and I had to find my way to the stairs along various corridors. The stairs were small, narrow, winding and steep with doors immediately at the top of each floor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c some open inwards and some the other way. Attaining the fourth floor feels like reaching the base camp for an attempt on Everest! The d\u00c3\u00a9cor is pretty grim and the management has not been troubled with a decorator\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s invoice for a couple of decades or more. Paint is worn and chipped and there is a slight musty smell to the corridors. The corridors are dimly lit and depressing. Still, from experience, sometimes the hotel is saved by a gem of a room. Sadly not on this occasion, One wall slanted at a sickening twenty degrees (see photo) and the room was adorned in a faded puke yellow with an old fashioned pattern. Most of the buttons on the room radio/intercom were missing and it had a very 70\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s look to it. The bed was very comfortable but the room suffered from lots of noise from the surrounding area (mostly fireworks during my stay). Then as I lay down I noted there was what appeared to be a map of the African Rift Valley on the ceiling \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no I was wrong, it was just a huge crack and damp patch \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it will fall soon so watch out if you have the dreaded Room 411. The electrics connecting the TV were interesting and wires and junction boxes hung from the wall (see photo). The waste paper bin appeared, at first glance, to have been emptied but then I noticed second hand chewing gum in the bottom. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcen suite\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 was rather sad. I recently stayed at a hostel recently where the toilet/bathroom was advertised accurately as a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwet room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. That room was larger than the one provided in the Ashley Hotel (see photo). The room provided by the Ashley Hotel should be described as a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwet room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. It is incredibly small (see photo) with little delineation between the facilities. Additionally there was no plug in the sink and water ran from the rear of the toilet over the floor when flushed! Reassuringly (I hope) the water was clear and was from the cistern. On leaving the Ashley Hotel I reported the missing plug and cistern issue to the two staff at reception. The male just said \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and the female remained fixated with her nails. There was no apology \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but then I did not expect one. All in all the hotel is convenient but was not worth the \u00c2\u00a370 I paid (and that was a discount rate). It epitomises so many London hotels; there is enough passing trade that we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to try too hard and do not need repeat custom. A Travelodge would provide a far superior hotel experience on so many levels.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA lovely welcome to London\u201d", "Author": "EclipseV", "ReviewID": "UR119829035", "Content": "I arrived in London from South Africa in September on a business trip, never having been in UK before.

There are a few decent restaurants in the neighborhood, which is pleasant in general. As others reported, you have to climb steep and narrow stairs to get to majority of the rooms.

The room was exceptionally tiny and reasonably clean, but the common bath facilities were inconvenient (no sink to wash hands in the bathroom) and the shower didn't drain well.

He then insisted I pay for the 4 nights upfront before I was even given an opportunity to see the room. I told him I would not be paying until I was shown the room. He eventually agreed to let us see the room. My family and I climbed an endless, narrow, dirty staircase (there is no lift) to the room. Trying to get out of the building quickly in an emergency situation would be impossible! The room was tiny and very unsafe. The windows were open and could not be closed/locked. All of the windows along the staircase were wide open, not something you want when you're asleep at night. The hotel was so horrible that we ended up leaving as soon as we got back downstairs (despite having already paid the deposit- 1 night). I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. I would not even let my dog sleep in it. The staff were incredibly rude and unprofessional. We slept in a nearby hotel which was much nicer for the same price.

I have read all my fellow travellers reviews of this hotel, and they are very mixed and quite harsh sometimes, which in my opinion is totally unjustified. The hotel location is superb, just off Paddington station (e.g. Heathrow Express - very handy) and you are literally minutes away (by bus) from Oxford Street, the British Museum, Madame Tussauds etc. Now there is a Hilton around the corner but if, like us, you prefer to spend your money on shopping, then Ashley is a very good choice. OK, the rooms are small (not handy if you have a lot of luggage) and the bathroom is the size of a shoebox. I have never seen one so small, actually. BUT! Everything is clean, safe, the breakfast is ok and there is a lovely park just outside the hotel. And there is wi/fi thoroughout the hotel. You just have to be realistic about your expectations.

The first complaint I had was that they insisted I pay for my stay immediately upon arrival. I refused on the grounds that I was a regular customer and that I would pay on departure as i do in all other hotels and as I have always done in the Ashley. They finally relented and agreed I could pay on departure. My second complaint concerned the breakfast. As a Bed and Breakfast establishment they really only have to get 2 things right i.e. the bed and the breakfast! The Ashley advertises a full English breakfast. The most important feature of the English breakfast is a large pot of tea ( or coffee if you're that way inclined). Imagine my surprise, therefore to find that the breakfast table had been set with no cups - just the saucers. When I enquired about the apparent oversight I was told that the cups were available at the buffet bar and that I had to make my own tea from a boiler located outside the breakfast room. If I needed a second or third cup of tea, I would have to go through the same ritual. That, to my mind is not a breakfast, much less an English breakfast.

We asked the receptionist to suggest a Restaurant late in the evening when we arrived that was within walking distance. We were directed to ASK, an Italian Restaurant on Spring Street which served Pizza/Pasta/ Salads at a reasonable price. It was just around the block and was an excellent recommendation. We dined there on two occassions. Our room was located on the third floor and contained a small seperate ensuite formed in the corner of the bedroom in which the shower and WC were to be found. The associated wash hand basin was located in the bedroom itself. Simple accommodation, some would say basic, but most importantly clean. There was plenty of hot water at all times. The Hotel is a labyrinth of staircases leading up four floors and it looks as though it was originally three town houses which are now joined together. A kettle was provided with tea/coffee etc. There was also a small TV in the bedroom with remote control. Breakfast was served from 7.30am to 9.00am in the basement dining room. This is not as grim a location as it initially sounds as the Ashley Hotel is a Victorian Townhouse and its basement, whilst below street level, receives natural daylight light from it basement windows set back from the street. Breakfast consisted of help yourself fruit juice and cereals, followed by an 'English Breakfast' of two slices of Bacon, a fried Egg and a Sausage and was quickly served by the waitress. The Bacon was particularly of good quality. (No white stuff ) Several customers asked for scrambled eggs instead of the fried egg and this again was no problem. A rack of Hot toast, white and wholemeal, was served at the table together with a pot of Tea/ Cafetiere of Coffee etc. When we asked for a refill, this was again quickly served. A good basic filling breakfast. Check out time was 10.00am. As we had a late afternoon train, we asked if we could leave our bags.

With that in mind the small room is not such a hassle and in fact is what most tourists will find unless you want to pay mega bucks at a big name hotel for the luxury of walking through a grand lobby before your get to your tiny room. The service was excellent and the staff very keen to please.

On my first morning, I found that my travel alarm wasn't working, so for the remainder of the visit, I especially appreciated the automated wake-up call system. I recall noticing on a visit several years ago that they had installed it, but I had never really needed it before. All I had to do was let the receptionist know sometime between 8:00 AM and 10:00 PM what time I needed a call, and he or she programmed the system. It worked perfectly reliably every day. The staff and management are friendly and helpful. The Managing Director is in the breakfast room each morning to offer touring advice to guests who ask, or to ask guests what they're planning for that day. If the plans are for something that he isn't familiar with, the next day he'll ask how it was so he'll know whether or not to recommend it to others. On the rare occasions when I've discovered a problem in my room, it has been taken care of promptly, thoroughly and with a smile. For example, on one of my recent stays (can't remember if it was in August or earlier last year), I discovered upon arrival that I couldn't open the window. I phoned the desk and a few minutes later the handyman appeared at the door. He had the window open and easily operable in no time flat. I've stayed at the Ashley for a week or longer each year since 1995, and will return twice this year. It has become my \"home-from-home\" in London.

The staff was very friendly and helpful. They assisted in recommending some restaurants and tourist spots. The entire hotel and my room was very clean. Their are no elevators therefore you should request a room on the first floor if you have plenty of luggage. The beds and pillows were firm and soft. The staff will fulfill your requests for extra sheets, towels, and pillows when needed. My room was facing the street where I heard plenty of noise throughout the night. Be aware that their is no receptionist between 10 PM and 8 AM. Therefore if you need an early wake up call you must bring your own battery operated alarm clock since the room I stayed in had no alarm clock and no electrical outlet. The location of this hotel was excellent. Paddington station is only 2 blocks to the left of the hotel. From there you can catch a 15 minute express train to the Heathrow airport. The area is also filled with restaurants, internet cafes, shops, and grocery strores for any late nite bites. The breakfast is was small but filling. It included one fried egg, bacon and sausage along with unlimited toast, juice, cereals, and coffee. I did'nt like that they served breakfast until 9 AM, being that you must be up early in order to have the free breakfast. Most hotels I stayed at served breakfast until 11 AM. Some suggestions- When travelling in London, avoid the cabs as they are extremelly expensive. Take the train from the Paddington station. Their are bus stops around the corner from the hotel as well. Also check out the brochures in the lower level of the hotel where you can find discounts on sightseeing tours.", "Date": "October 26, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cAn excellent value for money in London.\u201d", "Author": "Eric M", "ReviewID": "UR3911703", "Content": "The Ashley Hotel is a charming little hotel on a quiet square that is very conveniently located one block away from Paddington Station, giving guests easy access to Heathrow airport in 15 minutes, as well as access to the Underground and multiple bus lines. I stayed at this hotel from 7-11 September. I had booked a single room and upon my arrival, they put me in a larger double room as I had a large amount of luggage and they said the single room would be too small for me and my bags. They put me in a double room for the same price as I had reserved for the single room! This impressed me right from the start. The room was on the small side for a double, but more than adequate for one person. It was nicely furnished and had all the amenities a budget traveler could possibly need. TV, electric kettle with plenty of coffee and tea supplies, a small but perfectly functional bathroom with shower ensuite, and a small desk. If you need a hair dryer or an iron and ironing board they will loan them to you for the remainder of your stay. The mattress was soft and comfortable. They have a large delicious breakfast included in the price which includes plenty of juice and cereal, coffee and tea, sausage, bacon, eggs, and toast. At all times, the staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Closeby there are many restaurants, pubs, convenience stores, currency exchange , and a laundrette, and Paddington Station has many shops and supermarkets. I give this hotel 4 out of 5 because the hotel does not have an elevator and the stairs are narrow and steep, as in most buildings from this era. Still, they give discounts for rooms on the top floors if you are willing to get some exercise. Also, the water in the showers only got adequately hot in the mornings, the rest of the day if you wanted to take a shower the water only got lukewarm but still adequate for bathing, and the water temp did tend to fluctuate at times while showering. Overall however, the Ashley hotel is an excellent budget hotel and a great bargain for central London.", "Date": "September 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Castle Rock, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cGreat for families\u201d", "Author": "teacher0fmany", "ReviewID": "UR3677150", "Content": "Our family thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Ashley Hotel.
