The kitchenette has a sink, cupboards, hot plate and microwave oven - which is more than adequate to cook meals with. The service is good.

There were a couple of loud moments when our surrounding guests were not being aware that there is a quite time after ten. But the staff took care of every problem. We spent a two week stay that included Christmas and New Years. We were welcomed one night to a small gift from the hotel to show thanks for choosing Suites del Angel for our Holiday stay. We were even welcomed by Mari to join her and friend to go to the New Years Eve celebration that was happening right in front of the Angel. Which was a free concert of Los Tigers del Norte. I can't write enough about how great the room and the staff was.

The bathroom was modern and nice. I slept in the king size bed in the separate bedroom, with yet another TV. The connecting kitchen area had burners, plates, etc., including a water filter tap for drinking water. The cable TV had at least two, maybe three, english language stations with spanish sub-titles. Watched a little bit of \"Friends\" on the Warner channel. There is a really busy restaurant right around the corner, which fronted on Tiber street, which looked nice and was really crowded with locals for lunch and supper, but unfortunately we did not get the chance to eat there (go out the front entrance of Suites del Angel and turn right, and then right again on Rio Tiber, and it is there at Rio Lerma at Rio Tiber). The staff at Suites del Angel was really friendly and helpful, especially Gustavo. The maintenance man even fixed my eye glasses with a precision screwdriver when the lens popped out. There was an interesting mix of people staying at Suites del Angel - quite a few Mexican nationals I believe, as well as those from other countries. It seemed to be a good central location in Mexico City. I believe we paid around $69 a night, with booking through the AARP travel website. The Sanborns around the corner at the Monument to Independence, at Rio Tiber and La Reforma, is good for a late night desert and coffee. There was also a really popular (with locals) and interesting looking Catina if you turn left out of the hotel entrance on Rio Lerma , and go about 50 yards, on your left.
