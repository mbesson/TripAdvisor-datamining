We usually stay nearer to Times Square but I had business meetings to attend on the upper east side and the subway local #6 station is on Lexington Avenue only 3 blocks from the hotel. We got a king suite for about the same price as we usually pay for a nice king room near Times Square. The room was very spacious, clean, and nicely appointed. We were on the 16th floor facing Lexington Ave and my only complaint was street noise. When I go back, I may ask for a rear facing room. Service was good and the adjoining restaurant was a pleasant surprise. The location was perfect; easy subway access, in the middle of great shopping and still close enough to the theater district to walk.

The huge factor in this hotel is that you are simply in the heart of everything- a short walk about 10 mins takes you the corner of 5th Ave to Tiffanys- Central Park is about 15 mins walk - and its just beside Bloomingdales Department store if you can afford it. Didnt partake of the breakfast in the hotel mainly because it was like taking breakfast in any Irish Hotel, went to the local diners very cheap, great athmosphere. Metro nearby to take you to Ground Zero and Wall St , althought only used the bar once while there and there was in fairness a great athmosphere in it, the reception staff were fantastic - including the bell captian , we were particulary grateful to them for arranging a car to JFK on the return as it was the Eve of Thanksgiving and none of the yellow cabs wanted to go to JFKGreat City - Great Hotel!", "Date": "Dec 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR876485742", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "westone31"}, {"Content": "Highly recommend Irish breakfast Highly recommend the Irish or American breakfast at the Fitzpatrick.

We had stayed in the sister hotel, Fitzpatrick's Grand Central,2 years ago but couldn't get booked in there this time. We arrived mid afternoon and the helpful front of house staff soon had us checked in and dispatched to our 12th floor room. Minor disappointment as the room was to the rear of the hotel rather than to the front as we had requested on our booking some months before. But the room was nice and warm with the air con already blowing warm air- welcome as it was about -5c outside. The hotel is a lot smaller than a lot of NYC hotels, one reason why we choose it. The room had all the basic requirements- coffee maker, foc safe and a lovely big soft bed, upholstered to give a 4 poster feel. Not the biggest room and slightly smaller than the one we had in the sister hotel but plenty big for us. En-suite bathroom/shower + built-in wardrobe gave us ample space. There was a flat screen TV, but with v poor reception but we never used it much anyway. After storing our stuff we had a quick drink in the hotel bar, `Fitzers`. Apparently it has been recently refurbished but we felt it was a bit dull and lifeless. The main reason we choose this hotel was its location. At the uptown end of Lexington Avenue, an awful lot of real estate was within easy walking distance- 10 minutes to Central Park, Rockefeller Centre; about 30 minutes to Broadway/Times Square etc. And it is very to walk around and not get lost- the whole area is laid out in a big grid, all well signposted. In all our time there we never had to use a taxi or the subway. We prebooked a Grays Uptown and Downtown Loop bus tour to get round the city,which has hop on/off stops at about 45 major tourist sites the length of Manhattan.We didn't eat in the hotel at all- no atmosphere, as stated and overpriced. For breakfast each morning we went round the corner onto East 56th Street to `Madelines` Diner and had very nice breakfast rolls (eggs- over easy + bacon/sausage) coffee and orange all for an excellent price and the staff were as friendly as you could get anywhere. Other places we ate were Outback - an Australian themed steakhouse on 3rd Avenue (about 10 minutes away). OK food at a reasonable price. Also `Bubbagumps` on Broadway/Times Square- some critics label this place a tourist trap but we have been here twice and loved it - Forest Gump themed restaurant specializing mostly on shrimp dishes with great 1st floor views over Times Square. Very friendly and good craic - and you most probably will be tourists so why not! Another nice place was `PJ Carneys` bar on East 56th Street, on the other side of Lexington Ave from Madeline`s. A wee Irish bar with mostly Irish staff. Lovely cold beers and they were doing an afternoon/evening special of a pint and a burger or wings for $9.95- about \u62e25.10 when we were there. You could hardly get value like that at home and this was in the heart of NYC! Don't forget to tip, at those prices!!In summary, the hotel may not be the most exciting or the cheapest place to stay in NYC and but it is reliable and has a wonderful location for touring about.", "Date": "Feb 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR107513986", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "PartimeHolidaymaker"}, {"Content": "Holiday in New York We stayed here for 4 night in April 2006 as part of our holiday.

When we checked in, the lobby  restaurant were undergoing refurbishment, which we weren't warned about, however there was a big notice to say that for the inconvenience, a complimentary continental breakfast would be available in the bar.

There is a subway station two blocks north of the hotel at bloomingdales (which was perhaps too close, given that my fiancee loved the shops). The subway was a lot safer than you would be led to believe and an inexpensive way to travel around after your ticket for the sightseeing bus runs out! Also nearby is central park and a few blocks away from tiffany (too close again!).

We have stayed there twice with a young child. If you stay for a good number of nights in a row, you get a good discount. So, for a week this past July, it cost around $250 a night for a REAL two room suite- (not a fake suite that just has an alcove) It was really like a decent sized apartment. That is unbeatable in New York. This is a great option for a family where you want to put the kids to bed before you have to go to bed.The staff is very nice. Many employees from Ireland. It is a nice small hotel feel. The location is great. Right in midtown- a bit more of an upscale area. And, away from the lunacy of Times Square. If you are brining kids to NY- this is a great option- don't stay in Times Square!and the bad:Two visits in a row we got to the hotel late at night and they gave us a key. We opened the door only to find the room not ready for us. First time we opened the door to find someone else's clothes still in the closet. I closed the door quickly- they may have been in there. On the second visit, we opened the door to find dirty wine glasses and garbage on the table, and a used shower with wet towels on the floor.The housekeeping and front desk staff REALLY need to get their act together to know if people have indeed really checked out.Both of these were shocking and unforgivable for any hotel.On both ocassions we had this problem only on checkin.

True, the room did overlook the light-well, but was reasonably bright and most importantly had no noise from street, kitchens or elevator. In fact, the best surprise was that the room was HUGE by NYC standards, with a small kitchen area, lobby and walk in closet, as well as the queen sized bed and full bathroom (great toiletries by the way as well). Only criticism of the room would be the traditional floral decor which might not be everyone's taste (including mine).We found the bar to be a bit dingy, but with very friendly Irish staff, as well as live rugby. The concierge (also Irish) gave us a great recommendation for going out of the hotel for a drink as well, and when it poured with rain, the bell-boy was happy to lend us his umbrella.Finally, location was perfect for shopping (especially Bloomingdales) and had lots of reasonably priced eateries for breakfast and lunch nearby.

The accomodations for us were perfect, in that my husband and I shared the king-sized bed in the bedroom and my children all slept on the oversized pull-out sofa in the living room. All weekend the staff greeted my boys by name, provided information as quickly as we could ask it, and greeted us regularly with a smile and our names.

Overall I would stay again if the Waldorf or Sheraton Manhattan was not available.", "Date": "Mar 28, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR210372548", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "corkgurl"}, {"Content": "Good, Not Great.   showReview(3234768, 'full');", "Date": "Feb 28, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR183200518", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "juicyjules"}, {"Content": "Excellent hotel   showReview(3012962, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 17, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR703628416", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "techman56"}, {"Content": "Great location   showReview(2262422, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 2, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR953951496", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "bushkangar"}, {"Content": "Nice Hotel, Great location   showReview(2205983, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 19, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR796051483", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "HT1"}, {"Content": "Loved the Fitzpatrick!   showReview(2124010, 'full');", "Date": "May 27, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR526362615", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "great hotel   showReview(2113528, 'full');", "Date": "May 24, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR250682162", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Top notch!   showReview(1619708, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 29, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR936962298", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Even if money was no object, the Fitzpatrick is still the hotel I'd choose   showReview(1552090, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 14, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR159976609", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "ClassEClown"}, {"Content": "There is no fireside...   showReview(1481887, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 11, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR963317574", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Great Family Hotel   showReview(1439855, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 6, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR697355853", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "wild_john"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelID": "113309", "Price": "$409"}}
