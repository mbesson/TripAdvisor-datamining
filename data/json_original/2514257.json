On reading the details on the website and looking at the photo's, the hotel seemed a value for money option. The photo's made the hotel rooms to look very much like Premier Inn or Travelodge. The reality was very different, our room was only slightly wider than the double bed and was very cramped. The door was hanging off of the single wardrobe and each curtain was holding on for dear life by about 3 hooks and I'm surprised they didn't come down with the weight of the dust on them. All the walls were badly scuffed and marked and looked in desperate need of a lick of paint. As mentioned in other reviews, there was no remote control for the tv, the walls were very thin and we could hear next doors conversation and no doubt they could hear ours. The carpet was not clean especially around the edges and there was at least 3 cobwebs hanging from the ceiling. The breakfast was very basic, just Cornflakes and toast - which was made with soggy bread which must of been frozen. You could have a cooked breakfast for an extra \u00a34.95, but after seeing the state of our room we decided that we'd give it a miss. We appreciate that this is a more budget hotel but I've stayed in this type of rated hotel before and they have never been like this.

I'm sure those on the continent would be proud!! the juices are plentiful though not surprising considering the apple juice which i gave to my son tasted like urine?? While talking to the manager in the morning regarding the shower, I mentioned that the bed was completely knackered as we were basically sleeping on the broken divan base. He said straight away don't worry we'll change it, and guess what coming back from a long day visiting sites in London nothing had been done. Overall the location was perfect for Wembley, visiting London which was less than 20minutes on the tube. However the \u00a350 per night price tag, considering where you can stay in the country for the same is a mistake i won't make again in London.

We checked into a twin room and the receptionist (who was European - though why other reviewers see this as a negative thing I will never know as she spoke good English and was very friendly and helpful) gave us our keys and gave us a few tips. We went up to our room which was perfectly clean. The room looks a little dated but the beds were comfortable and the room was warm. The bathroom was on the smaller side but wasn't claustrophobic. I didn't eat at the breakfast but I grabbed some juice while there and the staff were very friendly and more than happy to help and it looked nice from what I could see - standard cereal / toast sort of thing. We even checked out a little late and there was no problem at all. Cons : The walls are quite thin. This didn't stop us from sleeping at all but in the morning we enjoyed a rendition of 'fight for this love' from one of our neighbours. Pros : On the website it says it is one mile from Wembley stadium - I wouldn't say it was a mile and it's very simple to get to from there. Very friendly staff who are interested in their guests. Lots of amenities near by. Close to the tube station. Good price. On the whole I think the hotel is great for what it is.

I get into my room to find three beds an old style tv looks about 20 years old, some towels on my bed and some drawers and a cupboard. Take a look in the bathroom and it is filthy you could see the dirt all over the tiles and in between the grout in the shower, there were no toiletries as advertised when i booked the room. The carpet was filthy and you could see a build up of dirt where it had never been hoovered, there were cobwebs all over the ceiling, the bed sheets were no better either i ended up throwing my bed sheet on the floor as i refused to lie in a flithy bed cover. The heating wasn't on when we arrived and after checking the raditors to see how to turn them on i discovered that there was no way of turning them on or even turning them down if it got to hot, decided to watch some tv only to discover the tv channels were not tuned in properly so when you thought i'll watch BBC 1 you had to spend 5 minutes working out which channel it was on as they were all muddled up and it did not have a proper arial signal. Never got any sleep as there were a lot of parties going on in the room next to us which they done nothing about, i refused to eat breakfast the next day because all i kept thinking was if the rooms were that bad imagine what was happening in the kitchen.
