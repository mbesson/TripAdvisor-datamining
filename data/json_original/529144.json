One vaporetto stop is nearby and the one to the islands is not too far away. The Old Ghetto historic area is just around the corner. The hotel offers a starter breakfast but having said that, you'll probably need to eat again 2 hours later. In busy season prices get steep and the hotel uses a nearby building with additional flats. If staying in Venice in a basic accommodation suits your style, and you accept the challenge of walking or taking a vaporetto (buy a pass) to the major attractions, then you might choose to stay here.

I was shown my room and deposited my luggage, although my room wasn't quite ready yet as I did arrive at 11:30 am. Breakfast, I must admit wasn't spectacular but when you've saved on the hotel you can afford to buy a coffee somewhere else if your that bothered!
