{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Love the LOKHA !! We stayed at the Lokha for 8 nights and it was great ! Our room was on the 3rd floor overlooking the pool all the rooms have a good view of the pool, the restaurant was lovely really good breakfast and delicious room service especially after a long hot day shopping !! The staff were all very friendly and nothing was to much trouble. The location is great all the shops are near by and the beach is just down the road a 5 min walk at the most. The rooms the pool and the garden are well looked after, I liked it so much I am returning again just after Christmas !! I would recommend the LOKHA to anyone.", "Date": "Dec 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR770290150", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "MichelleW"}, {"Content": "Loved it! I stayed at the Lokha in July 2008 for 7 nights and had a great time. I travelled with a group of teachers so we went during the school holidays, which was fine but slightly more expensive.The hotel check in was great, we got a free cocktail and didn't have to wait for our room even though we were over an hour early for check in. The room was slightly smaller than the website pictures make out but very comfy none the less.The air con was great, beds were so comfy and the clearer/maid service was fantastic. The staff were great, very friendly and helpful. The only complaint I have about our room was that our bath/shower leaked water all over the floor.The breakfast we had was amazing, so many choices with something new every day. I wouldn't recommend eating dinner at the hotel because there are so many other places close by that are cheaper and better. Drinks at the hotel were a bit pricey and it took a long time for them to organise any food and drink bills.Location was also good, close to shops and the beach. The pool at the hotel was also nice with a swim-up bar. Plenty of sun lounges and no screaming kids.Overall, the Lokha was great value for money, I would stay there again!", "Date": "Dec 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR161645157", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "kymb88"}, {"Content": "Noisy at the Lokha My wife and I recently stayed for 21days at the Lokha. Our booking was for a super deluxe room which is what we paid for, and knowing there were only 8 of them we booked one year in advance. However two of the 8 rooms are different in size and facilities, we were given one of these rooms and we were then moved a week later because they are alot smaller and are not the same as the others, this was annoying particularly as staff are aware of this. The hotel staff were very friendly and try to please where possible. The biggest problem was this is a boutique hotel very quiet with an older group of people staying there, unfortunately in the three weeks we were they we had three groups of loud rude unpleasant people, who had no consideration for other guests and the hotel did little about them despite lots of complaints. So despite reviews that we read previously saying it was quiet, this definitively was not the case..loud, loud loud. Rooms were clean, air con not so good, pool nice, pool bar slightly more expensive than others, you are not allowed your own drinks at the pool but people seem to ignore this rule and take there own. Asked for a quote for two weeks in March 09 thinking it would be cheaper direct, but the price was $600 more than booking with an agent here for a room on the second floor not like what we had this time.", "Date": "Nov 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR513371432", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "kartika"}, {"Content": "highly recomended we, a young couple from england, stayed at the lokha back in june and I've felt obliged to write a positive review ever since.

Not too far from the beach (maybe 250m?). Good shopping and restaurants in the neighbourhood. No drunken bogans wandering around.Check-in was average - our room wasn't ready so we had to wait about 40 mins to get in. Nice pool which we didn't use. Swim up bar and a few dozen pool side lounges. The room had two queen beds and was quite large. No furniture on our balcony so we had to drag the day-bed out which wouldn't fit but was ok hanging half in half out. TV - 60 channels which was quite good. No DVD player but. Beds were comfy enough. Bathroom was the let down. Average shower - fancy sink which looked nice but wasn't practical. Toilet right up against the bathroom door with the toilet paper right in your ribs. And the worst design feature I have ever seen in any hotel - an open window to the bathroom so that you can see the toilet from the bed. Weird. There is a little blind to obscure the view but nothing to stop the smell or sound. Stupidest thing I have ever seen.
