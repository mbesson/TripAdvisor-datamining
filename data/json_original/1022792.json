This was my first time going to this resort but I have travelled to Mexico many times in the past. We had previously attended a timeshare presentation for this resort before they had built it. I am glad I didn't buy into it. First, let me mention the NEGATIVES: - Our reservation was completely messed up. We were promised a 2 bedroom suite and complimentary Swedish massages for everyone in our party (6) during our stay by the booking agent at the resort (we had hard copy proof of this). When we got there, we were told that we could not get the promised room and were instead given 2 junior suites for 6 people + baby. In fact, they said they had no record of any of the promises that were made to us. We provided the proof of our reservation and they even talked to the booking agent we had booked it through (and she admitted to giving us this deal), yet we got no where with our arguments. The front desk manager (Jorge Nolasco and ?Jose...I can't recall his name)) was for the most part unhelpful nor sympathetic to our problem initially (he eventually came around but we still did not get our promised room). I must mention that we were not the only ones with reservation problems as there was one day when there was a long lineup of vacationers outside the managers office waiting to discuss reservation errors. In my opinion, this resort has a problem with communication between the various departments. One hand has no idea what the other hand is doing. They really need to get their act together on this. - The beach is a huge letdown. No one ever swam in the water as it was very muddy looking and unpleasant. The river side of the beach was more calm and amenable to snorkelling and canoeing. However, the snorkelling isn't very good as there are very few fish to see and the water is contaminated with debris from the plants below. If you want to go to a beach, take the shuttle to the sister resort (Fisherman's Village) for a day...there's a fantastic beach there. - The entertainment is incredibly dull and boring. If you want a completely dull, yet relaxing vacation then this place might do. But if you want any form of entertainment, this place just does not cut it. The entertainment that was provided was boring and tacky. They had a few dinners in the conference hall with live mexican bands that struggle to keep you entertained (barely anyone showed up for the dinner nor actually danced). There's also a random Michael Jackson tribute that just doesn't fit any theme. This place is boring during the day and gets even more boring at night. - This resort could benefit from providing more frequent service during busy times. For instance, during a packed March break week, there should be more shuttles to 5th Avenue (shopping/entertainment district) and Fisherman's Village while also providing more frequent snorkelling tours (only 1 per day!!). We found it difficult at times to book activities as there were limited spots and were often booked way in advance. Now to the POSITIVES: - Service in general is great. Right from the beginning, our bellboy (Ivan) was great and very patient. He moved our luggage himself from room to room as we were sorting our room situation out. He was also very informed and gave us a lot of advice about the resort, etc. The dining staff are for the most part good as well. By far the best waiter we ran into was Francisco at the asian fusion restaurant. He's the guy you want serving you every night as he's lively and really knows the food well (I think he used to be a chef). Room service is quick and pleasant while the housekeeping staff are extremely hardworking and creative. You certainly won't find it difficult to keep your hunger and thirst satisfied as staff are everywhere offering to get you a drink or bring you food (even by the pool and beach). Our VIP concierge guy (Luis) was also fantastic as he was always on the ball and helped take care of our issues. He also arranged for our massages and helped book our trips and activities. - We eventually got our complimentary massages and boy were they relaxing. The staff are very professional and provide helpful recommendations. - The food at the a la carte restaurants are generally good. Much of the menu items have an interesting Mexican twist to it so it's a nice break from the norm. I highly recommend trying all the restaurants during your stay. The buffet...well, it's a buffet...nothing special. We mainly had the breakfast buffet which has all your basics such as eggs/omelettes, bacon, sausage, some form of potatoes, etc. Room service is available 24/7 and the selection is decent and tasty. - This place is certainly clean for the most part. It is well maintained and kept and staff work hard to keep it like that. OVERALL: If you want to purely relax and do nothing during your vacation, then this is the place (minus a nice beach to swim in). Great food and good service, clean environment and far away from any form of rowdy activities. However, if you want a nice beach to swim in or to be entertained in any way, then look elsewhere. Be weary of your reservations and always carry hard copies of what you were promised during your vacation as communication between departments at this resort is lacking. Hope this helps.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "fort worth", "Title": "\u201cRelaxation in a beautiful setting\u201d", "Author": "fort4", "ReviewID": "UR126470272", "Content": "Hacienda Tres Rios offers a beautiful setting for relaxation in a secluded area.

Even though the beach is not the best for swimming, the pools and the two rivers will keep you busy for a while. Do not miss the opportunity to use their kayaks and catamarans. Also, make sure you snorkel in the two rivers, you'll see some crabs, fish and caves. On a week stay, probably a good idea to plan a couple of outings. The staff was always very courteous, and hard at work. Once in a while they may not follow through with your request, but overall they try hard. The food in general was OK. If your stay is all inclusive, favor the restaurants over the buffet: Kotori and Porto Bello offered better quality (Porto Bello did not allow children younger than 12 though). The 2 bedroom suite was very spacious, clean, and comfortable. The water pressure in the shower is low for water conservation purposes, so it is justifiable. Hands up for the ecofriendly approach!! Housekeeping was excellent, thanks Eduardo !! Bring your earplugs, we used them one evening when they were hosting a wedding at the beach with loud music until late hours... It comes handy to have small $ denomination for tips and small purchases. Bring your own hair conditioner since it is not provided.

Yes, there was a time share presentation, however the young lady who gave us the tour was delightful and knowledgable. We did have the nuisance of a very pushy guy for the last 10 minutes, who finally desisted when my husband did his demented Bill Murray/Jack Nicholson impression. However that was a really small price to pay for an otherwise amazing and affordable experience. The staff at the resort were, without exception, friendly and helpful at all times. This is not the place for people who want to party, which makes it perfect for those of us who enjoy the tranquil beauty of a place that truly embraces nature. Exploring the cenotes, lounging on beach beds, dining and drinking the beautiful pool... there was no shortage of delightful ways to pass the time. On a Mexican evening we chatted with a lovely man from an area near Mexico City who was celebrating his son's 9th birthday at this resort. The fact that Mexican people choose to vacation here - and have traditional Mexican weddings here, too - is a testament to this genuinely lovely resort. As a vegetarian, I found a multitude of delicious dishes. My carnivorous mate raved about the hamburgers at the poolside grill and we both loved the thin-crust pizzas made in a wood-fire oven. The culinary highlight, though, was the Portabella Restaurant. We've dined in Italy and France, but never had any meals as tasty as the ones we had here. The flambe dessert is extraordinary. Our hostess, Montjuith Robledo, was so warm and welcoming (she also hosted a terrific tequila tasting in the Sports Bar one afternoon) and the manager Rene Serrano does an impeccable job running a first-class restaurant. The dress code here is \"Caribbean formal\", which basically means long pants for guys, no shorts. . .comfortable but a little classier than beachwear.

Very clean hotel. Food was quite good. Beautiful grounds. 24-7 room service. And even though the resort was booked to capacity (March break), it was never \"busy\".

We had booked this by doing a trade through The Registry Collection using some of our fractional ownership time. We've come to expect first-class accomodations through The Registry and this was no exception. From the moment we arrived, where we were met by our butler (no normal check-in for us), who personally walked us to our unit, while pointing out the facilities of the resort, to our own personal \"check in\" handled by the butler (who was actually one of a team of 3, comprised of Julio, Francisco and Benito), they catered to our every need. An example was when they came in with a larger refrigerator on a dolly to give us some more room to store the food we had brought. Since the resort had just converted from being strickly all-inclusive to all-inclusive optional and we were there that way, the units weren't really set up for someone who wanted to use the kitchens and actually prepare a few meals, so our butlers merely provided the means for us to do so, bringing in the fridge, cooking utensils, dishes and silverware. La Harencia is a separate building from the rest of the resort and is the only one with butler service. On the top of the building is an open sun deck with 2 hot tubs, numerous lounges, tables and chairs. There is a great view of the property from up there, in fact, some may be happy to get their sun and r and r up there and never even go to the beach. The rest of the resort is beautiful! One small negative is that the pools, along with the hot tubs were not very warm and the water on the beach is a bit dirty-looking as there is a lot of organic material due to the discharge from the 3 rivers emptying into the ocean on the property. On the plus side, these 3 rivers connect to a number of \"cenotes\" upstream and the cool, clear water in them is fun to swim and snorkel in. It makes for a unique experience so don't miss it. The beach itself is very nice with numerous beds with sheets and pillows for those who want them. We also took advantage of the complimentary use of the catamarans and kayaks, which were a lot of fun when exploring the rivers and cenotes. The food in the numerous restaurants on the property was quite good, in general. We did have a bad experience in the eurasian restaurant one night, but management did what they could to make it right by picking up our dinner tab at the Mexican gourmet restaurant a few nights later.

Everything about our stay was exceptional\u2014from the food to the beaches, the activities, etc., but what makes this place really shine is the people who work here! Everyone we encountered was very friendly and extremely helpful...if you really want to see them smile, try some Spanish and ask them if you're saying it right! There are legions of willing Spanish teachers eager to help with words and accents! As it's an Eco-Resort, we were quite pleased to hear about and then be able to see for ourselves the wind and solar energy in use, how they are preserving and maintaining the mangroves and beaches, and the different ways they are using energy more efficiently and to great effect. Lighting, air conditioning, pool heating...you name it, they're figuring out ways to do it more efficiently, and with less harm to the environment. There is something for everyone here...we saw many people with little babies, toddlers, young children, tweens and teens, and not one of them seemed bored or out of place. There were young couples, elderly couples, families, people with disabilities (the entire resort is handicap accessible!), and though it was nearly at capacity, we never felt as if there was no place to go to get some quiet time, or as if we were tripping over other people, and if you want social-time, there were always friendly people anywhere you went! And as to food? Well, with five different restaurants and a caf\u00e9, plus 24-hour room service, there really is something to please every palate\u2014from casual buffet-style dining well-suited for families and kids, to an Italian, adults-only restaurant with superior service and incredibly personable servers (Guillermo was awesome!). One really can't go wrong with any of the choices, and with so many different choices, even after a whole week, I had yet to become bored with the offerings. But, I think what I enjoyed most was being able to connect with nature...if you want pristine, perfect white beaches and Caribbean blue waters, you may find yourself disappointed. But if you love an abundance of water and sea birds, 3 kinds of crabs, and a multitude of fresh/salt water fish, you will find yourself as thrilled as I was. Don;t get me wrong, the beaches are beautiful, but because of the three rivers, there will be some run-off, so the waters are crystal clear, but many-coloured, from deep aquas to the lightest greens to clear and sweet, there are no dead waters here, folks; this place teems with life and beauty! We saw coatis, raccoons, spider monkeys, parrots, Mexican blue jays, pelicans, cormorants, plovers, sandpipers, terns, vultures...I could go on and on! And with the opportunity to snorkel, kayak, sail or just swim, there are many ways to enjoy the natural wonders of this resort!

Great swimming pools and activities if you want, but also peaceful areas to relax, especially the super-comfortable 4-poster beachbeds - somehow, there was always at least one available! Although the sand is darkened by the silt from the rivers (well, one of the attractions is the three rivers!), it is beautifully clean, as is the water (although silty in patches). If you prefer cooler water you can swim closer to the river - delightful! We were constantly amazed by the wildlife around the complex and the nature reserve - well done, Tres Rios, for culturing this kind of environment. We had a great time on the kayaks - I'm surprised to read a review saying they weren't available, as they were when we were there, within reason. The gym is another plus point of this place - if you feel as though you've overfed a bit (as you will with all the lovely restaurants on offer here) you can get pumping in the gym. My favourite was the exercise bike in front of a large picture window overlooking the mangrove. The food was mostly excellent, and all the waiters were very happy to accommodate (I like a nice soft-boiled egg in the morning, which wasn't on the menu). The buffet was surprisingly healthy, delicious and fresh, especially breakfast and lunch...dinner could be a bit iffy, but then we spent most dinners at the Mexican restaurant or the Hacienda Grill amongst the swimming pools. The staff were excellent, and this is from an English woman who didn't realise about tipping for a few days. The staff were all clearly very happy to be working there, from the lowliest chambermaids to the Head Chef, Oscar, who is hilarious, but also very professional and extremely hardworking. He would always have one eye on the running of the place, and clearly only accepts the best from his staff, who seem eager to please their boss. The activities were well run by English speaking staff, fun, safe and educational all at once. One tip - make sure you bring proper shoes: I couldn't go on the cycle tour of the cenotes in sandal, gutted! I did, however manage to make a kayak-trip up the river from the sea to one of the cenotes, what a great experience! As a honeymooning couple without kids, we avoided the 'family fun' evenings, but the children and families there seemed to be having a whale of a time whenever we saw them. We enjoyed quiet evening walks along the beaches, and also a couple of outings to Playa del Carmen (let off a bit of steam at Coco Bongo, definitely worth a visit if you enjoy dancing and shows!).

The hotel and all of its rooms are marbled floored with nice artwork. All rooms have good views of the river, pools and ocean. Rooms are larger than most other hotels rooms and since they opened in 2010 are all newly appointed. The pools separate the hotel from the ocean. The kid's pool is freshwater while the three other pools are saltwater. You have two outdoor facilities to eat. The outdoor pizza oven makes thin and crispy delicious individual pizzas. The outdoor Grill serves lunch and dinner with the dinner meals being very very good. The indoor restaurants are Mexican, Asian or Italian. Long pants and a collared shirt are the dress codes. The meals are beautifully set with equaling taste. The service from all staff is excellent as they are fast and everywhere. There is a coffee/dessert room open most any daylight hour until late in the night. Small venues of entertainment alternates between Karaoke, Singers with accompanying keyboard for dancing, Mexican singers and dancers, Brazilian drummers and dancers and other small groups in different parts of the complex. Larger entertainment on the big stage consisted of a circus performance group, a Michael Jackson dance group, a Mariachi band, all doing fine jobs on a professional local level. The beach is not as large as beaches closer to Playa del Carmen and the ocean is clouded by the rivers emptying into the ocean. Yet One of the greatest attributes of this resort is the rivers. You can snorkel down to the river or kayak up and down them. You can simply let the fairly strong current glide you into the ocean allowing you to walk ankle deep back to do it all over again. They have added more beach accessing a second river since 2010. Improvements will continue as they have the first of 20 towers for their future Zip line along with another complex of rooms. Eventually the resort beach will be just under one mile long when they add the yacht basin. Our friends who have been to 114 countries said they put Hacienda Tres Rios in their top five resorts. If you want nicer beaches and water take their van to their sister resort \"Fisherman's Village\". It is just South of Playa del Carmen. Try their cream corned soup, mixed seafood grill and Riviera Mayan drink made in layers of Melon liquor, orange juice, and topped by a frozen mixture of vodka and strawberries. I loved anything with tomato sauce and all of their pepper dishes. Other things to do: Shop Playa del Carmen. Take a tour of CHICHEN ITZA but use a guide as they explain the ruins. Without the guide you would loose the flavor of the entire culture. The guided bus trip is too long as it goes first back to Cancun and then Westward to the ruins. It takes 3.5 hours one way. Along the way you have lunch and are treated to authentic Mexican dancers. As top to artisans making tourist items will be another short stop. Quality is assured but if you don't care about quality or authentic items you can buy them much cheaper inside Chitzen Itza. Vendors are said to have to support the Mexican Mafia but believe what you wish. Relatives have told us not to miss XEL-HA and XCARET. We will catch them next time. We visited sister resorts of Sunset Lagoon and the Royal Sunset in Cancun. The rooms and hotels were handsomely designed. Both have been totally redone since 2010. We also visited the Isla Mujeres. The Northern beach was nice as was traveling the entire island in a self driven golf cart. Expect rows of tourist shops in town and a Cuba like 1950's residential ghetto everywhere else. While an experience to see it is not our first choice of a place to visit. Although we didn't do it the snorkeling boats looked like they were having a very good time.

Unable to get a loan to rebuild Tres Rios stepped up financially to build on the 300 plus acres and provide the necessary funds to rebuild the eco park. There are many beautiful marble filled all inclusive resorts within the riviera Maya but what distinguishes this is it's ties with nature. There are three rivers on the property that empty into the ocean that you are able to explore. You can swim , snorkel , or kayak these beautiful waters. Be sure to bring an underwater camera so you can capture the beauty that lies beneath the waters surface. Many people pay to go on an exursion to partake in these activities which are complimentary at this resort.

I must say, the hotel room was amazing -- we had the family suite through my parents-in-law timeshare which consisted of a huge living/dinning room off which are a master bedroom suite (king bed, sitting room area, Jacuzzi bath) and a second bedroom (two queen beds, sitting room area). In addition, the room had three full bathrooms. Everything looked very new, tv's were all flat panel, etc. Now for the food. For an all inclusive resort, I would say the food is what one might expect. Not great, but not bad either. So far so good. Now the things we didn't like about the resort. The pool. Looked very nice and there was always plenty of seating. However, it was really cool, primarily because the nearby fresh water from the close by underground rivers are used to maintain the water in the pool. Such a shame, because my daughter and wife simply decided not to use the pool itself. The beach. Not much to say here, except the ocean water is full of dark stuff (seaweed??) and so you really don't want to go in the water. This presented more of an issue for me, because we found the swimming pool too cool to enjoy. Also, the beach itself, while it looked like white sand, was rock hard underfoot so not nice for the kids to play on. NOW THE WORST -- the timeshare scammers. As soon as you check in there's pressure from the concierge, the check-in people, basically everyone to go to a timeshare presentation. They couch it in terms of an orientation presentation, although it's pretty clear what they are trying to do -- sell timeshares. In fact, we weren't permitted to check-in until we sat through 30 mins of one of the concierges trying to convince us to attend one of the presentations. Later that same day, my parents-in-laws checked in and agreed to go to the presentation even though they already own a time share with the group operating the hotel. They were told that they would receive \"IMPORTANT\" information about their current time share. During the presentation they were pressured into agreeing to upgrade their timeshare into a \"fractional ownership\" by which they were told they would have part ownership in the property. That was a complete lie. When I reviewed the contract, they had been duped into signing a contract for a timeshare exactly the same as they already had except the annual fees were considerably higher. They also duped into giving up their previous timeshare as part of the \"deal.\" The only reason they agreed to this was because they were told they would be part owners of the property and so it would be a good investment which they \"guaranteed\" would quadruple in value within two years. Clearly, the contract bore no resemblance to what they had been told they were purchasing. Luckily under Mexican law, all time share contracts must have a clause by which you can change your mind within 5 days (i.e., to revocate the contract). We immediately did that for my parents-in-law, following the instructions within the contract exactly. Within 15 days of that, the timeshare company (Sunset Group) was required to return the deposit. Guess what -- that didn't happen. Luckily, the deposit was made by credit card, so they were able to dispute it. However, since November, the Sunset Group has been pestering them for the money threatening the use of a collections agency. My Advice -- PLEASE PLEASE do not let yourself be scammed into purchasing a timeshare at any of the Sunset Group Hotels (including the Hacienda Tres Rios). If you are inclined to buy a timeshare at one of their resorts, do yourself a favor and look online for others trying to sell theirs -- they cost considerably less than buying direct from the hotels. Also, don't believe them if they try to tell you that what you're buying is an investment or some sort of fractional ownership in the property -- it simply is not. Oh by they way, I confronted the management and asked them put in writing that they would buy back the timeshare for the \"guaranteed\" amount they said it would be worth in the future. Surprise, surprise they would not.", "Date": "February 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amherst, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNothing is perfect, but this was close.

We are still here and are sad to leace on Wednesday. The staff here goes above and beyond to make sure your experience is perfect. I love that there are kayaks, cenotes right on property. Typically, you would have to spend $100's of dollars for an entrance fee to another park in order to have the same experiences that you can have right here at the Rios. Room service is fast. Make sure if you need your mini bar stocked to call room service. They are happy to do this. I love that the property has its own water filtration systems. The tap water here tastes better than the bottled water that is served all over Mexico. There is no funny \"aftertaste\" in their food. The food, well, its \"All Inclusive\". I learned early on that if you choose to stay at an all inclusive, cut them some slack. It's no chop house, but over all, very enjoyable. What I love most about the food is that you can essentially ask them to prepare anything special, and they will do it. If you are on a diet, this is your plave. They serve steamed chicken and veggies EVERY day. When I say steamed, I mean steamed, no oil, no seasoning. When we 1st arrived, we stayed on the bottom floor in a jacuzzi suite, very lovely room, however there was an ant problem. We paid to upgrade, it would have been nice to be upgraded without a charge, since there were ants. I do, however, understand this property is on a lush/tropical resort. Nature will be nature. There are DVD's in every room, and I recommend bringing your own DVD's as the ones to rent on property are very out-dated. The beach is not the best, but everything in this hotel is super clean.

They have a nursery which is being used in part to reforest the parts of the mangrove which suffered damage, and the environment of the property as a whole is very healthy, as is evidenced by the vast numbers of fish living in the small rivers. They take being \"green\" to a whole new level; for example, the heat generated by the air conditioning units is used to heat the water in your shower, and they have their own desalinization system to minimize the amount of water taken from the natural environment. That said, you'll never think about ecology once you sit down at the dinner table - wow! The food at H3R is as gourmet as you'll find anywhere, and unlike some all-inclusives you could stay here for weeks and not eat the same dish twice. I highly recommend finishing dinner with a Mayan coffee - it's great for settling the stomach after over-indulging! (Gabriel at the Italian restaurant makes it the best!) As for the beverages, I can vouch for their mojitos being the best I've ever had, and sipping cappucinos by the river in the morning or martinis on the terrace in the evening feels incredibly decadent. The staff were all friendly and gave excellent service, with each one taking pride in doing their job well. The luxurious decor of this hotel seems to blend seemlessly and tastefully with the natural environment around it, using soft earth tones, mahogany wood, and an abundance of marble. If there is a drawback, it's just that at times a dark \"sludge\" washes up on parts (not all) of the beach, making thoses areas unappealing for bathing. (It's just organic material which washes out from the rivers into the sea, nothing harmful.)

We had to reschedule because Hurricane Irene grounded all flights out of Newark, NJ but HTR was excellent in changing our original booking. They arranged for transportation to pick us up at the airport and it took us straight to the hotel. The hotel/resort is only a year old and it definitely felt that way. The one thing that kind of put me off was the intro our \"concierge\" gave us when we arrived. Yes, she acquainted us with the resort and told us all we needed to know but then came the sell to have us tour the timeshares so we could get free massages or a free dinner as an incentive. It was a clever way to rope us in. The resort is great for families who like outdoor activities. You can run along the walking trails or the beach. You can kayak up 3 of the rivers that run through the 300+ acres that make up the resort property. There's snorkeling in the rivers and the ocean and much more. They also have a biking tour throughout the property and they even let you tour their nursery where they're growing more indigenous species to continue planting on the eco-friendly resort. The letdowns were the food and the drinks. I'm a bit of a foodie and I like my swim-up pool bars. There are 2 pools but they're not much to look at and they don't have swim up bars. There are 5 restaurants to eat at for dinner and the Asian one was by far the best. They have a nice selection of food to eat but nothing stood out as exemplary. The beach isn't the best but it's still relaxing to grab a cabana on the beach and listen to the waves. The nightlife is so-so, since the resort is more family-friendly. Also, the walls of the rooms are a bit thin, so if you have noisy neighbors who want to continue partying past closing time, bring earplugs (something I needed to use).

The resort is gorgeous but not THE most beautiful resort we have ever seen. The night life is almost none existent but we weren't there to party into the wee hours. The service is undeninably the best we have ever encountered in the 30 years we have been travelling. ANYTHING you want gets done and it gets done with a huge smile followed by perfectly spoken English and a willingness to do even more. We stayed in the Los Hodas building which came with its own Butler and our 2 bedroom room was 2000 sq ft with a massive patio. The resort itself is on a nature preserve and they have won awards for being so ecologically cognisent of their surroundings. There are many cenotes (swimming holes) with rivers that have a nice soft current that allows you to effortlessly snorkel all the way to the ocean. They give you a life jacket and away you go. There are 2 rivers...take them both...this is a MUST do. The beach itself is at the end of many miles of beach and yes, it's not the nicest section because of the mirkiness of the mangos that are beside this resort for a few miles. A small walk up the beach and you have the water you most like to see while vacationing in this region. A couple of other MUST DO's while here; have the chef's dinner which is a private meal in the kitchen prepared personally for you by their head chef. Sounds unappealing but you have to spoil yourself with this. It's free, but they ask you to buy a bottle of wine which will run you $100. The next must do is having a private dinner in your room. Anything you want will be brought to you and served to you all the time of your meal with every aspect of a $500 meal taken care of....free. The food anywhere in this resort is probably some of the best food we have had anywhere...and I'm very picky about my food. Order your drinks with the best booze of your choice and they have it...don't be shy to ask every time. The most expensive Rye, Rum Vodka, Scotch etc etc is all for the asking...no extra charge. Upstairs in the Mexican restaurant is a wonderful area with a Tequila Bar. The bartender's name is Jose and he knows everything there is to know about Tequila. You'll sample the best Tequila in the country and this isn't the stuff you throw back and suck a lime. This is par to some of the world's best Scotch's, so treat it accordingly. There are time-shares here....and I never thought I would ever say this in my life, but take the tour.

The person checking us in told us we were the last of the wedding party to arrive and that the hotel was 80% booked (he said this with so much pride that i gather they rarely get to this level of capacity). We went to our room which had two beds, when we specifically asked for one king. We walked back to the check in desk which was in a separate building (thus requiring us to once again traipse accross a bridge over a lagoon that smelled distinctly of diarrhea in the pouring rain). At that point, the manager told us they were at capacity and that even if we had booked a king room, what we were given was all they had. When I pointed out that the snide gentleman who had checked us in mentioned that they were at 80% capacity she retorted that \"we have a limited number of king beds\". Well, then don't guaratnee people king beds. At that point, after having traveled for 12 hours we were in no mood to argue and returned to our rooms in the pouring rain over the lagoon that smelled of diarrhea. Some of the light bulbs in the room didn't work. We were at the resort for two nights and our room was not cleaned once. The housekeeper did knock on our door on our first full day at 5pm (after we had been out all day, giving her ample time to clean) and we told her to come back at 6pm. We made sure we were gone by then. When we came back, the room was never cleaned. The resort was beautiful, but it all seemed very surface. The resort is a giant \"Monet\". The closer you get to anything, the more you notice it is crumbling, there are little ants crawling around everywhere, and dishes are cleaned by hand outdoors with no soap. The beach was nice and the service personnel were extremely hard working, and attentive. They deserve all the credit for making the stay bearable. The front desk people were completely rude, disorganized and uninterested. They also cursed at me in spanish under their breath. But, luckily I understood them and cursed right back. Now, the icing on the proverbial cake. The FOOD: As I mentioned, the servers were amazing. But the food they served, awful. The pasta with tomato sauce that we ordered in room service was actually pasta with tobasco sauce. The pizza was inedible, even after 15 tequila shots. The Buffet restaurant was equally terrible and frustrating. The \"cold cuts\", I kid you not, was spam, and turkey spam (at least they gave a choice). The breakfast consisted of runny eggs that were clearly powdered, and french toast, waffles and pancakes that were so hard they would literally shatter if you banged them on your plate. Even though the resort is all inclusive, they wouldnt let us bring any snacks from the buffet to the bar to watch the Giants/Packers playoff game. Even though EVERYONE IN THERE WAS PAYING THE ALL INCLUSIVE. No one I spoke to out of the 150 person party I was with had anything good to say about the food. It was literally inedible. If we had been there for a week I don't know what we would have done, other than lose weight (a secret benefit!). Do yourself a favor, avoid this place, unless you are on a diet.

I brought my own bottle of water from my hotel room. I wasn't drinking at this point and next thing I remember after the older couple left and after I was having a few shots at the pool table was blacked out and I'm on the beach being held from behind by someone. Scary as all hell. The only reason I knew it was a wait staff/hotel employee was due to the fact that I spotted another man to the side with their hotel uniform on and the one behind me holding me, just kept repeating, it's okay, seniorita.... okayyyyyy seniorita, as i was fondled below. Coming to at that point was extremely frightening and I bolted for the hotel lobby. I have blood all over my jean capris.... which have been thrown out due to the memory of it all, and am recovering from a large gash going from my knee up my thigh..... possibly from falling upon escape. I did look up on google and found similar other stories horror stories from Mexico Mayan Riviera area. This was reported to my booking agency, as I do not want this to happen to anyone else. I'm traumatized. And it was my honeymoon. The best they could do at the front desk was offer me tea.... I got no check up by a doctor (they claim to have one on site) and that's when I went back out to the front desk to try to get somewhere. Pretty much nothing happened. I barely wrote anything about it on a generic comment sheet they make you sign on the way out..... because who the hell wants to relive that the day after the event!?! I was told the employee would be found and fired and I'd receive an email shortly from them about what was happening. NO EMAIL..... I'm sure it wasn't reported. This is a \"5 star resort\" - they must want to keep up their good appearance. Now let me tell you about the resort..... it was beautiful, sterile like a hospital inside but beautiful. Stocked fridges in rooms w soda and corona. I preferred the coca cola. The entrance LOOKS heavily secured, they check all in going and out going vehicles and room #s. But that doesn't mean that they check their employees with the same security so watch out. Also if you are a female.....( with curves, or even with just 2 legs and 2 arms I'd say), several of the male staff will look you up and down - very uncomfortable. Word of advice, do not leave your hotel room after 11pm as most people have gone to bed and it's like a ghost town on the premises. With it being a so called 5 star hotel, and the appearance of security and the fact that you're on a gated in community, you'd think you'd be safe. But please please don't take your chances..... I can say as many great things as I can think of about their food, the bed, the shower, etc...... but it doesn't change the fact that it doesn't feel safe after 11 when restaurants are closed, etc. Now, for the rest of my review on the hotel itself......... Hotel inside was always freezing...... beach looks nothing like the web pictures.... it's pretty but not swimable for the most part. The pools are freezing..... hot tubs aren't hot enough in the pool area. Drinks aren't blended well enough by 8/10 of the staff and you get big ice chunks in a smoothie/slush drink. Other hand, drinks were never watered down - good ratio of alcohol to non alcoholic contents. There was one lady with a blue skirt always walking around pool area but mainly beach waiting on people out on the beds..... she was excellent - quick, friendly, even took me and showed me where I could find a bathroom - ps. no close bathroom to the pool - gotta hitch it to your room or inside the lobby - imagine that with a kid!!! I don't want to imagine that. Food= Buffet..... if you're a vegetarian like myself, plan on eating meat, eggs and stuff with cream in it all week - you can't survive on just melons & local fruits at breakfast and you'll find only a weak flavored salad at the Grill restaurant outside at night. Or you could eat guacamole 24-7. So anyway, not being a strict strict vegetarian, I went down the seafood route - I do eat some seafood - and had omellettes in the morning. Omellette lady's awesome. So is the lady in the coffee shop. So, this resort offers very few seafood dishes.... no shrimp cocktails!!!!!!! WHAT?!!!! Kotori was amazing and probably had the BEST service of all places, that goes for the pizza place outside as well. The outdoor grille was good on service, average on food. Buffet food for 8/10ths was a complete joke - barely ever changing. My husband tried the kiddie nuggets they have there and couldn't eat them because they were rock hard. Juice therapy is a joke - they make everything seem a gazillion times better on the site. And I was promised champagne, etc in room for honeymoon - NEVER got it and never got it after talking to concierge. If they want to tell you about the resort - tell them you have to go to the bathroom or meet someone, because it's a half hour of them trying to sell you tours ranging from 60 to 100 ea outside of the resort and by the way - we did the tour in Tulum Ruins for $6 American Dollars a head & walked at our own pace. Those tours were so large, I'm guessing most except those directly next to the speaker would be disappointed. Must warn you about the guys on Sun/Tues nights..... selling stuff there - local vendors - they WILL harrass you as you walk through the main area. Nothing is priced. A man tried to hock off a $35 gift store mask to us for $140 USD! WOW! We took it for $40.... he wouldn't stop hassling us, threatened us about his kids and family and had his vendor-mates circle around us. Avoid the main walk way on those nights like the plague or walk through without looking up or side to side. I'm going to give major thumbs up to the 2 or 3 youngest tour guys and gal for the little on site free expeditions...... speak English extremely well, one was FROM the states, extremely nice.... give thumbs up to the pregnant coffee barista in the coffee shop (ps coffee shop is similar to a large Keurig & snacks on plates comparable to vending machine or cafeteria food. Give a thumbs up to the lady at concierge we dealt with.... tall blonde haired lady - very nice...... Angelese in the Spa she was amazing....... our waiter in the Kotori Japanese restaurant. Mariaches on Mexican Party night were awesome. They make some good martinis, AWESOME Mojitos & strawberry daquiris and requested drinks. Request your drink, cause most often if you don't they'll put this white cream looking stuff in it and it's very milky.... they try to put the Pina Colada in everything! Burgers suck..... nachos were great and I ate probably 20 lbs of guacamole.

The sand beach was well maintained with plenty of places to relax. We also took a walk down the beach that seemed to stretch forever - we could have walked for hours - not rocky, just sand.

When I asked for bottled water in the lobby, I was told to treck across the resort to my room and order from room service.

When I ordered food from the Pizza Fire Grill, and was told 15 minutes , when I returned to get it I waited a further 25 minutes, asking the waitress if it had even been made, which I kept being told yes., After a total of 45 minutes, they finally made my order, but had made at least 15 others which were placed as I stood there, while I was waiting, which was fifteen minutes after my order was placed.

I am writing this review as we just booked a return trip. Between our first trip and now, we have stayed at other resorts in the area. We now know our way around, up and down the coast and are looking forward to coming back, this time, to HTR for a second time. There are a few things we learned on our first visit to HTR that will prepare us for our next trip...and may be helpful to others who visit. I would say the first trip was really a good overall experience. Now that we have been to HTR, and have learned a few things the hard way about the place, we are hoping for a better vacation and overall experience at HTR. First trip: we checked in and were taken to our room without our bags. We were told they are on the way. One hour and two calls to the front desk later, they had not arrived. We went to the lobby to see our bags unattended by the door. We grabbed our bags and went back to the room. We wanted to get changed and get outside...not wait for our bags that may never have shown up! Next trip: we will hold on to our bags! Keep a firm grip and elbows out! First trip: the nice girl that showed us our room identified herself as our personal concierge. Then she pressured us to sit in on a time share presentation. She seemed hurt when we told her we just want our bags (see above), get outside and begin relaxing. After more pressure for a time share and more refusals, she asked if there was anything else she could do. We requested more hair conditioner and bottled water. She never did arrange more water or conditioner. Actually, we never saw our \"personal concierge\" again the rest of the week. This trip: be firm about no time share. It is our vacation. We are not buying a time share. One little push from them gets a bigger push back. First trip: surly guy that is in charge of pool towels. Did I say he was surly? He really takes the towel count seriously and is quick to blame you for a lost or damaged towel or towel card. We did not lose or damage a towel, nor did we lose a towel card. However, it is a bother, when on vacation, to be reminded of this several times each day. This trip: we are actually packing some of our own towels. Kind of silly to do at at all-inclusive, but it will get us out of dealing with surly towel guy. First trip: food was overall very good. We did enjoy local fruits and many good dishes. Some of the entrees did get a bit redundant, particularly the shrimp, which was the only seafood available during our visit, unless you paid a ton of money for the \"lobster dinner\", or attended a time share, where one of the gifts was.....a \"lobster dinner\". Apparently the shrimp can only be prepared one way. It was good, but got tiresome the third time around. It was not until later in our trip, faced with shrimp the same way for the lousyeth time, that we were informed that they could do some special items for us that were not on the menu. This trip: we tell them what we want if it is not on the menu. First trip: The beach is not the greatest in the area. As the name would imply, there are a few rivers that all empty near the beach. The water is a bit murky and the beach a bit more eroded than others. The area off to the left and down just a few minutes walk seems to be someone's special trash dump. Someone should go in and clean it up. Maybe it will be clean by our next visit. The area off to the right leads to other resorts, nicer beaches, clear water and no trash dumps. Other resorts we have stayed at in the area, we have seen sea turtles and beautiful fish just off the beach. Not really happening at HTR. Next trip: Maybe someone will read this and do something. Otherwise, we will avoid the trash off to the left and venture down the beach to the right. Last trip: We were placed in a handicap room. We do not require such facilities. The room was located on the ground floor where everyone goes to and from the main areas. It did get a bit noisy at times. We did have people hanging out in front of our room smoking and we had dishes left at our door a few times. This was all on account of where our room was located. We were told the only other rooms available would be an upgrade that we would have to pay a ton more money for. Next time: we will be more choosy about the room when we first arrive and get it sorted before we unpack and settle in. First trip: Drink service at the beach was spotty. Service got bad to non-existent when they were setting up for events. We just eventually gave up and went to the bar and got our own drinks. Next trip: We get our own drinks if it seems like the service will be the same as last time. First trip: The touch screen system was malfunctioning. This affected using internet through the system and we were unable to order room service through that system as well. We were told they were working out some issues and we could order room service by phone. Next trip: hopefully the touch screen system is sorted out. If not, I will not waste a minute feeling silly trying to make it do something. Pros: -Many individuals really seemed to care about us having a good time and enjoying our stay. -The room and the hotel overall, except as described above, was clean. -Nice little goodies on our pillow each night. -The entertainment was very good. Much better than other resorts we have stayed at. It was not nightly, but it was very entertaining. -Coffee shop was nice. Good quality coffee, nice little treats. Friendly staff. You may be surprised at how other resorts miss the mark on coffee. -Plenty of fresh tropical fruit. Again, you may surprised at how other resorts miss the mark on this as well. Why come to Mexico and not have a nice bowl of fruit? HTR seems to understand! -Good quality cocktails and ingredients. Top shelf booze freely poured. We are the type that would prefer to enjoy a quality drink, not guzzle several cheap ones. Thumbs up to HTR. -Nice walk on property to cenotes. -Brick oven pizzas and calzones by the pool. Cons: As described above. -Avoid time share like the plague. Unless it is your thing. -Less than optimal beach and ocean at this location. -Surly towel guy in his towel czar hut giving you the stink eye with his surly towel beady eye.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cNice December getaway\u201d", "Author": "CRAE0457", "ReviewID": "UR122256876", "Content": "The Hacienda Tres Rios resort was very nice.

Wanted to get an honest review out as things are fresh on my mind. So you understand my view point my wife and I travel outside of the US more than 3 times a year, so we are tough but fair when rating a place. Lets get started..... Food is excellent, we have eaten at places around the world and spent over $1,000 on a dinner for 4 in places like Dubai, and Europe.....the food here is excellent. Room service is average as it is not unusual to wait 30 - 40 minutes........most important is the order has always been accurate. Grounds are well maintained with plenty of ocean access and pools. Rooms are average in size, well maintained. Issues......as I type Texas is playing Cal in a NCAA football game on ESPN......however we are getting soccer on ESPN. The Sports Bar here is a joke; they get the same channels we get in our room. American TV selection is average at best, not uncommon as you travel but usually a sports bar will have Direct TV or a satellite to get guests multiple options........ One concern is there is no ethernet connectivity in the room, nor a true business center. I needed to log into some brokerage accounts and check some financials, and was told to pay 5 bucks for 30 minutes to gain secured access.........not only is the wireless unsecured but the signal is very weak. If the rooms were equipped with DSL that would solve my Texas problem as the game is on ESPN 3 (internet). Shuttle service was not booked 3 of the 4 days we requested it; disappointing as we are not only guests but members since 2008 prior to consruction completion. I will end with the staff is GREAT......they are always helpful and friendly, as you would expect.

I have read the reviews and the positive ones are right on, the negative ones are short sided. It is obvious people did not do their homework while at the resort. This is phase 1 of a 4 phase project. When complete there will be a beach bar, adults only section, marina, private residence capabilities and much more. This area was hit hard by a hurricane. The Tres Rios team is doing all the right things to ensure the beach becomes as pristine as it once was and that areas hit by the hurricane are brought back to their original state. They respect the area, history and the environment. The nature preserve is awesome. Taking a walk through the jungle in the morning is a highlight. There are 10 cenotes on the property and some of them you can swim, snorkel and kayak. This is a \u201cgreen\u201d resort which was very attractive to us. While a lot of hotels call themselves green this resort takes it to a new level, a level that other hotels worldwide should strive to achieve. They have won and been nominated for numerous awards not just in Mexico but globally. The food at all the restaurants was top notch. The grouper and red snapper was to die for as was the lobster, lamb, seafood risotto and so much more. The portions were perfect, not too much and always presented exquisitely. As far as the staff goes, there is not much to say but wow. We felt pampered every step of the way. Everyone you pass will say hola, buenos dias, buenos noches, etc. , from the housecleaners to the managers. We were assigned a private concierge when we began our stay, Andreina, who was wonderful. Every step of the way she answered questions we had, made sure we had reservations, transportation, anything we needed. She always did so with sincerity and a smile on her face. We felt like we found a new friend. The restaurant and bar staff are all excellent, but we wanted to point out a few who went above and beyond. Antonio was our waiter on the beach one day. He brought us appetizers and water when we first laid out on the beach chairs and kept bringing drinks even though we never asked for them. As the week went on he remembered us whether he was in the Grill or the Buffet and always made a point to hi to us and ask how we were doing. Jaime was our waiter twice in the Grill and he had the same attentive, personal style. Solomon was our waiter one very special night that we will describe a bit later in the Asian restaurant. He was full of class and dignity. He certainly knew his wine and food. He was excellent. Oswaldo is the manager in the Asian restaurant and fantastic is all we can say about Oswaldo. Like Andreina, we felt like we found a new friend. He made us Mayan coffee every night (if you haven\u2019t had it you have too, it\u2019s the perfect nightcap). This is time consuming drink made table side but he was always more than happy to make it for us even if the restaurant was busy. Oswaldo also gave us one of the highlights of our trip. They had just put in a wine cellar in a corner of the restaurant and had two tables in the room closed off from the rest of the restaurant. They had come up with the idea of having \u201cspecial\u201d dinners in the cellar with wine petals on the tables, great wine and the best of the menu. We were guinea pigs so to speak but we felt so incredibly special. I\u2019m sure through time they will tweak this until it becomes something really special. They need mood lighting, music and other things but for one night we had the time of our life. Solomon was the waiter and he was great. We met the executive chef, Oscar, also a wonderful, fun person. Oswaldo always came in to make sure we were enjoying our selves. Truly a memorable experience. There are improvements to be made. The internet service is iffy at best especially during peak times morning and evening. The house wine and champagne need to be upgraded to match the resort. There are dead times when you cant find food anywhere. There is no bar you can belly up to either at the beach, pool or inside, which is a no no at a beach resort. I am confident all these things will improve as the resort continues with their expansion. We look forward to coming back when phase 2 is done and many more times in the future.

Recently, we received a weeks long stay at the Tres Rios as a gift, and to tell you the truth, we would have probably had a better stay at a Motel Six in South Central LA, I kid you not. It may seem I'm being a bit harsh on Tres Rios, however I must admit there were several high points worth mentioning.The room was simple and clean with comfortable beds. Additionally, the wait-staff here is incredible, all pleasant and helpful, and...and that's it. Here's a small taste of our week at Tres Rios. We arrived at the main lobby and were directed to the front desk, and then asked to take a seat where we would be formally greeted by our own \"personal concierge.\" We sat waiting for 45 minutes until our \"personal concierge\" presented herself. After formal introductions, she told us about various activities packages available to us as guests. Only there was one little thing to gain access to these activities. That one little thing? Do a forty-five minute breakfast, on them (our trip was all inclusive), with one of their reps to let us know all Hacienda Tres Rios has to offer, then, we free to enjoy nirvanah. Now, neither me nor my girlfriend just fell off the back of a turnip truck. We knew the breakfast was a time-share pitch. So we figured we'll sit down with the rep for breakfast tell him no thanks to the time-share pitch, and we're on our way. Not-a-chance! Four and one half hours and two pitchmen later, we left at our wits end. These guys were relentless. We had to actually walk out. The front desk consierge had all the personality of a chair and seemed to be put out by the smallest request, like making arrangements for transportation to the airport , or printing out a boarding pass, to name a few. The activities desk was another area of excellence. If they didn't offer the activity, then they didn't go out of their way to point us in a direction to find it on our own. The ecopark, basically two small streams and a mudhole that's suppose to be a beach. I've seen cleaner back-washes, no exageration. The main beach itself was horrid. If you don't own a timeshare then the shuttle is not available to you, which means a $40.00 USD minimum roundtrip cab ride to the closest town. The food was mediocre at best.

I have been to many caribbean locations as well as Hawaii and can't say I prefer any other to Riviera Maya. This trip is my 5th time to this region and this was my favorite Hotel/Resort by far. The food and drink were top notch and there was always somewhere new to eat and something to try somewhere (my kids loved the pizza and we all loved the food at the grill next to the pool). We had so much fun in the pool, which is clean and beautiful, both with and without Maya (the super-friendly pool activity director). We enjoyed the bikes and kayaks(both guided and independently). We went out on the catamaran with a guide and it was great. We never felt pressured into buying a timeshare (I just wanted to comment on this since some people claim the contrary), someone asked if we would be interested and when we declined it was never brought up again. If there is a negative about this place it's the \"beach\", don't get me wrong it's beautiful, but the water is not super clear so if you are looking for that you might upset. The upside of the beaches are the cenotes. We spent hours and hours exploring and swimming in them and they are so pretty and unique. Make sure you visit the sister hotel Sunset Fisherman at least once for a memorable day in Playa Del Carmen. We went there twice and had a ball both times. The beach there is picture book pretty and the pool is quite unique. Overall, I think they could do a better job communicating everything that's available and I wish we had known they no longer offered snorkeling equipment to guests so we could have brought our stuff from home but those are tiny nitpicks and we had an amazing vacation that I can re-live in my fondest memories.", "Date": "December 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAwsome time service even better.

So they sent in this hot girl in to try to do the job. but that didn't work either. This place had the best room service out of any hotel I've ever been to. all i can say is wow!!! tequila shots and club sandwiches at 4 in the morning and as much beer as we wanted to refill our minibar! that's what I'm talking about! The staff were incredible, the bar tenders were on top of there game, drink ready before i even reached the bar. But my favorite was Jennifer she is the party organizer and does all the tours.she was a blast!! We did the kayak tour, hobby cats and played volleyball until the sun went down with all the activities staff. They made a great team but a lot of them are not there anymore.:-( We all partied at the clubs in Playa Del Carmen and they showed me a unique side of that place that I never did when I was there in 2004. i love this place, I'm coming back to the Riviera Maya February 2012!!!!!! Ya this resort its a little quieter then others but the staff, service, hospitality, food and top notch alcohol make up for it!

We went down for a friend's wedding that was at a resort 40 min away. We shoulda just stayed at my friend's resort instead of H3R but we were pulled in by a marketing call that offered us a much lower rate in exchange for attending a timeshare presentation. In the end, we did not ending up saving much in comparison and could've avoided the whole timeshare fiasco. Check in: When we got there the room was not ready but we were an hour early for check-in. They let us go to one of the restaurants and we had a meal at the buffet. The food was sub-par. Definitely not 5-star, I could get this at any of the buffets back home that I tend to avoid anyway since buffet food is dry after being left out too long under the heaters. Our concierge, Maria was nice, but then again she had to be and kept reminding us that we had a meeting the next morning for our presentation. The front desk had a trainee who was super apologetic for the wait, we only had to wait an extra 20 min after eating to get our room. The room: The room is gorgeous!! And after having stayed at our friend's resort for wedding for a night, the H3R room and resort in general far outclassed it. We got a Junior studio with two queen beds, no jacuzzi. The bathroom was the size of the 3/4 of the room and had the best shower I've ever been in. Beautiful and large and luxurious. However, the bathroom did not have a fan and so after a shower, of which we took many, you have to leave the door open to let out the humidity. The beds were so comfortable, my boyfriend and I completely dozed off everytime we got on them and had some of the best sleep of our lives, and we are difficult sleepers. The 500-thread count sheets felt heavenly, but I did spy one or two holes in the sheets, the bathrobe and the comforter. The down comforter had feathers that every-so often would poke out. TV had english channels as well as spanish and we didn't lack for movies to watch. We had a room in the 3000's but it was situated right outside the main floor and near the entertaining area across a cenote, so at night you could hear the entertainment if there was any. Also, you could hear everything that was going on in the hallways at all times and in the rooms adjacent to us. Soundproofing was horrible. One morning just before heading out to the beach, they decided to fix the tiles in front of our room, it was so loud I thought they were tearing down the next room! Whenever we put up the sign to get our room cleaned, we would come back to a perfectly made room during the few hours we were gone. We left tip for the maid each time. Internet connection was shaky, it would often cut out. But it was enough for my bf to get some work done. Yes, on vacation but we didn't pick the time period. There are computers in the coffee shop, but you need to insert cash or a credit card. Food: The international buffet, like I said was mediocre. But my boyfriend kept wanting to go there. I loved the Asian restaurant, the beef was cooked to perfection. The Italian was decent, my food was pretty good, I had the grilled seafood and my bf had the risotto, which he hated but I thought wasn't so bad. One of the nights was mexican night, it was rained out so they moved it into the buffet, the food was decent but definitely not 5-star. I tired the Caf\u00e9 de Paris, the coffee was not something I'd ever have again, it was worst than Starbucks coffee and made from the kind of espresso machine I have at home. The pastries were hit or miss, some were great and some not, depends on your taste. Lots of times, kids would be hanging out in there or in the computer room next to it watching TV, it seems that besides the pool, there wasn't much for kids to do, and many families brought kids along. We loved the pizza place outside near the adult pool, service was friendly and prompt. One of the raccoon-like creatures kept coming to me to try to get food, I was scared it was claw me with its long claws but my boyfriend would throw pizza crusts into the bushes to make it go away or our friendly waiter would come shoo it away. The creature's name was Pancho, according to our waiter. Cute but a bit too friendly. Service: we tipped all our waiters about 2$ each meal, and they appreciated it but never acted like we had to. All wait staff was friendly, we never had to wait long for our food. We had silver bracelets on (will explain after) but we noticed that no one was treated differently no matter what color bracelet you had on. Everyone had the same service, I was keen on observing treatment at all tables and everyone was treated just like us. Casa Las Islas: we had breakfast here with the salesperson the day of the presentation. Nothing special, regular breakfast buffet with an omelette station and typical breakfast fare. Nothing outstanding. We had drinks at the Sports Bar, they have a pool table there and karaoke night there that some people seemed to enjoy. We had pretty good drinks at resort, I don't know why one lady said the drinks were never cold, ours were always iced and refilled promptly whether at the restaurant or by the beach. We never tried the Mexican restaurant since we went to Mexican food night. We did room service 3 times due to laziness, the food wasn't as good as what you could get outside the rooms. I recommend getting food in the restaurants as much as possible. If you do get room service, the Norwegian salmon for dinner and the breakfasts are great. Service was prompt and very friendly though. They aren't good about collecting our plates after, but a quick call and they come fast enough. If you leave your plates in the room, teeny weeny ants appear and start crawling around wherever you leave and food or drink. They are nowhere to be seen if the plates are gone though, never saw them in the bed or suitcases etc. Food poisoning: we are not sure where we got it as we did not stay at the resort the entire time, but we did get food poisoning and spent a good amount of time in the bathroom. I had brought along some anti-diarrheals but needless to say, some food or water somewhere did not agree with us. Timeshare presentation: If it weren't for this part, we would've had a much more enjoyable time at the resort. We were stuck from 9:30AM to 3:30PM!!!!!! with our salesperson. He was pushy but not unfriendly, all the salepeople treated us decently, but probably because we agreed to buy. SOOOO stupid, I know!! Even after I had read all the reviews here before going, it came down to us being so tired after the long day and our salesguy's non-stop pitch that somehow we convinced ourselves that it was a good deal. It did sound like a good deal. But after signing, and getting our hot pink bracelets traded for silver, we went back to our hotel room and read over the documents, it was then that we realized that we could not afford the deal. Even though it wasn't very much to pay, I'm going back to school soon and so we'd be down to just my bf's income. So since we had 5 days to cancel, we handwrote out two documents about canceling the contract. THE VERY NEXT DAY, we went back to the salesroom and had the contract canceled. We expected to have to fight, but the manager was very courteous, understood our situation and although he tried to bargain down the price even further, freeze the deal for 2 years and offer us another trip down there for a bargain price, we refused. We got a refund receipt on our credit card and a contract saying we cancelled the whole deal. The manager was very understanding but did ask that we give a tip for the waiters. We gave 3$. Then we left and for the next 5 days were never bothered again. Although we kept an eye out for the concierge and the salespeople, afraid that someone would treat us badly or come try to sell to us again. My credit card company says the refund won't be in for another 2 weeks, and if it does not come in, to send the refund receipt and the contract cancellation and they'd block the resort and get us out credit back no problem. Bottom line, just say no if you do not have the money and are not interested. We were stupid, period. One couple we talked to upon leaving said they were only in the presentation for 2.5 hours, said no and were outta there. Bracelets: Our salesguy said that people were treated a bit differently depending on their bracelet color. I was keen on watching people, and no one was ever treated any differently depending on their bracelets. Even though we never went back to get our bracelets changed. There were bracelets of all different colors on everyone and we saw people with our old pink bracelets getting the same service from the same wait staff as us. Tours: We only had time after the presentation to do a kayak tour. We were the only ones on the tour, it was great except I forgot the bug spray in the room and got bit 13 times by mosquitoes. My bf and the guides did not get bit once. It was fun, our first time kayaking and we were horrible so it was hilarious the entire time. Our guides were awesome. On the day we left some ladies were going around trying to get people signed up for bike tours, senseadventure tours etc. We saw people on other tours, it seemed like a fun for those with kids on the bike tours. Pool: Towel service was quick. Drink service on the beach was good. The family pool has three jacuzzis with different temps marked depending on how hot you like it. I loved all three. Both pools were huge and beautiful and I swam in both. Beach: Like all reviews, it was not swimmable. Black water and a bit cold. But if you walk further down, you get patches of clear water,. We still did not go in. I went to the beach in Playa del Carmen one of the days (20$cab ride each way, you do not need to tip the drivers) and the beach there was great, blue water, white sand. We also went to Tulum on a fun tour zip-lining, rappeling, bungee-jumping and snorkeling in an underwater cave tour (we loved that day), the beach by the ruins is the most perfect beach. Clear blue waters, soft white sand and not many people, but we were limited on time during the tour and could not go into it save for a few pictures of us getting our feet wet. Besides the day in Tulum, day in Playa del Carmen, two days at our friend's wedding, we were not at H3R for many days. Mostly there to eat, and we sunbathed by the beach which had wonderful beach beds and beach chairs. We noticed that people from the resort next door, Blue Bay kept wandering over to our beach to use the beds and the chairs. Airport transport went smoothly, no hassle, no wait, no crowds. We never went to the spa, had no time. Or the gym. I wanted to do the yoga classes offered each day but we never made it to one. Overall, besides the timeshare stupidity, we could've have a much better time. 5-star rooms and service, 2-3 star food. Wish we had time for more of the tours and activities. If we had only stayed at the resort though, I think we would've been too bored and could've saved more money and hassle staying elsewhere.", "Date": "December 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maple Grove, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cService, above and beyond\u201d", "Author": "Todd L", "ReviewID": "UR121180042", "Content": "The people that work at this resort are the best.

In Playa Del Carmen the sea is so beautiful and the beaches are beyond glorious. When we arrived at HTR after a chaotic shuttle transfer from the airport I just sprinted to the beach. The photos used by HTR to sell the place are very misleading. The photos of clear blue water are taken on the river that flows into the sea next to the resort. There is no beach to enjoy or get into the water. It is contaminated with Mangrove and basically looks like an oil spill happened. I will include photos. The water is black.and they stopped cleaning it up due to the costly effort, so they say. I also love great food. The food schedule is almost laughable. At night you can enjoy the Japanese, Italian, and Mexican restaurants which were all decent.The standard and sub par buffet that is supposed to be available \"all the time\" is not. My husband and I are not big drinkers, but I have never been to an all inclusive that made it so difficult to get a drink, soft drink, even water throughout the day.There is a Sports Bar that I think is a great concept. except that drinks are only available at night. We are always very polite and gracious people and we are offended when staff is rude. I have never heard the words \"we are closed\" and \"no\" anywhere (so much) ever. The positive things, would be comfortable beds and clean rooms and linen all the time. The maids are great. The critters that roam the place were a huge highlight for me. The nature park is 90% swamp but there is one Cenote (Natural spring type pond) that is very cool and you can swim in it. There is no snorkeling anymore provided by HTR because they said people took all the snorkeling gear and they no longer have it.... : ( The cenote would have been great to snorkel in.) The Time share/ownership presentation was fairly professional in my view. I was honest about my reasons for saying no- you have no beach! Your service is moderately bad, why would I buy here? Another crazy issue, sunrise is at 5:45 AM this time of year and the curtains in the room are sheer white- so rise and shine, like it or not. We were also given two full size beds rather than a king size bed which we found annoying because we are a married couple, and generally like to sleep together. We called the front desk and they said nothing was available. My husband and I took the Chitchen Iza tour and very much recommend it. It was a long but amazing day. We also went downtown to the beautiful beaches 2 different days. HTR is pretty far from the downtown area and you will pay $19 each way to go- pretty pricey.My advice- determine what is important to you in your vacation and plan accordingly. My expectations from an all inclusive are very realistic. I don't expect perfection but this place falls short, and a presentation asking me to purchase a $250,000 Villa that does not exist, but they promise it will....at some point is pretty darn funny.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Island, NY", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Vacation\u201d", "Author": "gpmcbride", "ReviewID": "UR121144681", "Content": "We recently visited during Thanksgiving week and had a truly wonderful vacation. My family of 4 shared a deluxe suite which was comfortable, clean and luxurious. My in-laws had a studio with a king bed which was equally as nice. The staff is friendly and hospitable and most of the food was excellent. We ate in all of the restaurants and did not get bored with the food. I think it would be boring if you only ate at the buffet, but with all the restaurants, there is no reason to stick to the buffet. Room service is also popular and there are so many choices. Drinks and snacks were also available poolside so I enjoyed ordering a mojito along with grilled shrimp for lunch. You can also get personal pizzas and calzones served poolside and on the beach as well. I was extremely annoyed by people who put their belongings on the beds on the beach and then left for hours at a time, which is very rude. The resort cannot be held responsible for the selfishness of some of their guests. We took the shuttle to Fisherman's which is right on the ocean and enjoyed that. I have two reasons for not giving this resort an excellent. First, the location is great if you are really into outdoor sports such as kayaking, biking and snorkeling, but they did not allow you to take a bicycle and explore the cenotes on your own. Big mistake, especially if you have teenage boys who just want to go off on their own. They should have half and full day snorkeling and kayaking tours as well. I just cannot understand why their activities were so limited. I ended up buying my boys snorkeling equipment from Walmart in Playa del Carmen, so they could do some exploring on their own. Had I known the resort did not have snorkeling equipment, I have have brought it from home. Second, the staff is excellent, but the management needs some help. Some meals just took too long and it was really due to poor management of the restaurants. I'm used to meals taking longer in other countries, but two evening meals and one lunch at the Hacienda Grill just took way too long.

It was frustrating and we eventually avoided the front desk. The shuttle service was spotty. I envisioned a person waiting for us with a van or car. What we received was a mob(30-40) of people waiting for transport for 30-60 min. all going to different resorts. The return was better but not great. Beach is as most reviews suggest. The water is dark brown in certain area. To the resorts credit they worked very hard to keep the shore as clean as possible. Beach is clean with nice beds and chairs. Crystal clear water could be found in the Cenote river area. Now the very good. Wait staff and housekeeping are the stars of the show at this place. Excellent at every turn.

Although reserving a two bedroom timeshare we were told upon check in that wasn't available and we were downgraded to a one bedroom for the first night then got two studios for the rest of the stay. There were no sheets, pillows or blankets for the pull out couch on the first night. No drinks in the mini bar. No coffee or water. Food in most of the restaurants was either mediocre or so adventurous that it was just not hitting the mark. The chefs need to rework the menus. Activities on the property are ok, from biking to kayaking but there is no warning that the hungry mosquitos will eat you alive in the river. Or you will be going upstream for the return trip which is very exhausting in the hot weather. Our kayak was leaky and taking on water which made it twice as hard to manuver back up the river. Pool area is nice with plenty of chairs and towels. Staff very attentive offering drinks. Nice wildlife including exotic birds and coati mundis. Not much to do after 8 pm unless you like hanging in a sports bar with random karaoke singers. Service in all of the restaurants was excellent though the welcome party dinner played music so loud most of the families with kids left covering their ears. Caribbean night could have had a more authentic menu rather than repeat of the daily dinner buffet. Finally the resort does not offer any evening transportation to Playa Del Carmen and it is a $25 (w/tip) taxi ride each way which makes for an expensive time nightly if you want off the property. Definitely not a five star, more like three and a half star resort.", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Panama City Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful\u201d", "Author": "JayMoney850", "ReviewID": "UR120801328", "Content": "The property sits in a great location for a couple looking for well needed \"R&R\".

I have been traveling to Mexico twice a year for the past 20 years and this was undoubtably the worst experience I have ever had. Upon landing in Cancun and being told transportation would be waiting for us at the airport to take us to the resort we waited 3 hours {with many phone calls to the resort). We ended up taking a taxi that was being shared with other travelers to other resorts. Our arrival at the resort was delayed an additional hour because of this. Upon arrival at the resort we were again delayed access to our rooms until we listened to a 30 minute presentation about the hotel. Though we paid for a 2 bedroom suite we were given two separate rooms with an adjoining door. When we questioned this we were told it was a computer glich, though we had our copy of the confirmation, and there was nothing they could do to help us. The service in the restaurants was very pleasant and there were a couple of real bright stars who seemed to really enjoy there job. The service at the pool was always questionable...and sometimes down right rude, like they were doing us a favor...Though management seemed to be around they did not seem to have a purpose except to walk by rapidly as though they were really busy. The front desk was unhelpful in all respects from answering the phone to providing any information about anything. All in all it was a very poorly run, expensive resort!

Before going I had read several reviews that gave this property bad comments so I felt compelled to write a review upon our return. We were there the first week of November a hurricane had come through the week before so the weather was ideal. Upon landing we rented a car and were on our way. Upon our arrival we quickly checked in but then had to meet with a concierge (ours was Louis who was pretty flaky) to discuss tours, the lay out, and timeshare presentations. That only took about 20 minutes upon arrival so it wasn't that bad but I think the resort should have you do that after you get settled, it's too much to take in immediatetly upon arrival. One person in our party had to spend 2 hours with a timeshare representative but did recieve a massage in return as well as a secocnd one for another member of our party. Food: We ate at every restaurant on property (except dinner at the Hacienda Grill because that menu looked like a hodgepodge of all the others). Breakfast: Buffet. This was good. A pretty decent assortment of food. Fruits, cheeses, american style waffles and stuff, and mexican entrees like beans or tortillas. Also there is an omelet maker and a tortilla/quesadilla maker. Recommend picking your items for the omelet and having them heat your tortillas and then making your own version of a breafast wrap. Service is good but the staff comes around about every 10 seconds trying to take your plates so that can be a little annoying as you are still eating. The Grill -- The Grill is also open for breakfast as ala carte not buffet. They had a very good black bean egg type tortilla dish. This place was also good for daytime snacks while laying at the pool. Recommend the shrimp and the ceviche. Don't get the spinach dip. Be careful some items don't translate well when they come out, not what you would expect. Service was very good. Pizza - good for lounging at the pool, dinner, or lunch. Pizzas and Calzones were made quickly and were quite tasty. Service was very good, watch out for the odd cat/ardvark animals that run the whole property (they call them ponchos) they can be aggressive with going after your food. The Italian Place -- it is along the side of the resort and looks like it is in a church. The food here was very good, this may have been my favorite place. We shared several appetizers (entrees) and a parta dish or two. The Carbonara was divine and we had risotto in squid ink (ordered by accident) which was good if you like that flavor. The main dishes were good and the deserts were good too. Again very nice staff and good service. Mexican Restaurant -- Good. Asian Restaurant -- this was just ok for me. They do have a small sampling of sushi but we had to ask for it, it wasn't on the menu. Drinks - pretty good. The wine selection was decent. If you like bananas ask for the crazy monkey by the main pool. Entertainment: The Sports Bar was open most nights and had activites in it. They also have a couple of games of Jenga for those that like that sort of thing. We attended a wine tasting in there whihc was just ok, the wines weren't that great. We also attending the animal towel making class which was fun and we learned how to make elephants and turtles. We took a catamaran trip one day out of Cancun which had snorkeling, shopping, and beachtime. That was a good day. We went on a kayak tour on the resort but I was not that impressed. The tour itself was pretty short, or it seemed that way, and at the end you can swim in one of the cenotes but there wasn't much to see. I would recommend taking kayaks out on your own if you like to kayak and just head down the river. Also we took a Hobie cat out with the help of one of the guys down on the beach which was fun, free, and worth it. We had a car so we went to Playa Del Carmen one day and spent the day on the beach and walked around, I recommend checking that out. The Property: Tres Rios is on a habitat that is kind of like being in the jungle. They advertise about the cenotes but from what I saw when we walked around if you are going to this property to see those don't bother. Most of them are in bug infested trees and look like these black mucky holes with random ladders sticking out. Me, no way I am crawling into the unknown! The pools were good, there is an adults only pool which was appreciated. There is a gym on site which was pretty decent, not your usual one treadmill (maybe that works) and a weight in a room. It is in the spa area. THE BEACH -- I read alot of reviews slamming the beaches at Tres Rios. Yes, if you are looking for pristine waters you are better off going into Playa Del Carmen. Due to the weather and the mangroves there is a mucky substance that is in the water making it a dull in appearance. But the pools are right there is you want to go in clear water. The beach has really comfortable beds set up and it's nice to hang out at sunset. Very pretty. Rooms: The rooms were nice but I will say that if you are staying in the studio rooms with an adjoining room that does not belong to you it can be very LOUD at night. Also for some unknown reason the last 3 days we were there there was a constant sound of dragging furniture and slamming something all night.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ocean Park, Washington", "Title": "\u201cWelcome Home\u201d", "Author": "snady1955", "ReviewID": "UR120648352", "Content": "Just got back from 2 glorious weeks at Hacienda Tres Rios.

We have been to several properties (Cancun, Cozumel, Riviera Maya, Playa Del Carmen and Puerto Vallarta) and the food and service in Mexico is fantastic and I've never had a complaint. Hacienda was awful. We were suppose to have transportation from the airport and was left there for 3 hours and then ended up taking a taxi anyway. The front desk was not concerned whatsoever with the delay, they're main interest was selling time shares even though they claim they don't do that. They would not give us our room keys until we sat down and listened to the thirty minute presentation about the hotel (after already being delayed several hours). We were were suppose to have a two bedroom suite with a dining room and they put us in two separate rooms, like we wouldn't notice and when we told them this wasn't right, they said there was nothing they could do, the hotel was booked for the week. Again, no concern or \"I'm sorry, let's make this right for you\". They gave us a blank piece of paper and said to write it down?!? Later in the week we talked to some residence and found out that everyone is given different bracelets based on whether you have a time share or not, if you are looking to buy a time share or if you've just purchashed a time share (or residence as they call it) and you are treated accordingly. We had another couple join us later in the week that booked their vacation through an on-line vacation site so were assigned a different color bracelet, the servers at the restaurant actually commented that our two groups shoudn't be sitting together based on our bracelets. Unreal. I can say that for the most part, the servers in the resturants were very pleasant, the servers at the pool were a crap shoot, one day you would get a great one, the next you wouldn't see her for hours and it doesn't matter how much you tip. We were actually told at one point a manager instructed one of your servers to leave and go fold napkins instead of wait on customers at the pool. The whole area was lining up in the grill resturant for drinks. The staff never really knew what was going on, you could ask a question to three different people and get three different answers. The staff at the front desk were rude, the managers walked around all day but were rude and the service in the rest of the resort is sporatic. This was a bad experience and unfortunately, two in our group will probably never go back to the Cancun/Playa/Riviera area because of this experience.

We were supposed to stay there for 5 nights but packed our bags and got the heck out of there after 2 nights. Here is a list of complaints we have. 1- From the beginning the reception staff was not very friendly nor did they smile at their guests. 2- Rooms were given late to us. We arrived tired from our flight around 1pm at the hotel and they said the rooms would be available by 3pm. We did not get our room until 3:45 after we yelling at the reception staff to give us a room 3- We were promised an ocean view but this hotel is not on the ocean. The ocean is a five minute walk away from the hotel itself. We enjoy looking at the ocean from our rooms but all we could see was a bunch of trees. 4- We were told that there would be snorkeling provided for at this hotel but they have not finished that section of the hotel grounds and even told us that they have quit make a snorkeling section because of the expenses. 5- The food was below par. We have stayed at other all-inclusive hotels in cancun and the buffets at these other hotels were amazing. When we got to this hotel we were shocked to see the limited variety of food at this buffet even though they claim that it is a five star hotel. 6- The raccoons and coatimundi were everywhere. The most shocking thing we witnessed at this hotel was at night while we walked around the empty hotel grounds, we witnessed around 10 of these animals eating leftover bits on the countertops where chefs and bartendars prepare food and drinks. These animals may have diseases like rabies and this is a great health violation. When we asked the receptionist about this, she said 'What do you expect? We are in the middle of a jungle'. I did not know that I can stay at a five star hotel in the middle of the jungle. 7- We decided to take part in the bicycle tour around the hotel grounds. The 'mountain' bikes that they provided us with were in the worst condition possible. The bikes looked like they were from the year 1900. They were dirty, rusty, not taken care of, very uncomfortable to sit on, and extremely unsafe to ride. One of our friends fell off the bike twice because of how horrible the bikes were. She got a huge bruise on her thigh which pained her for the rest of our vacation. 8- The hairdryers are worst hairdryers I have ever seen in my life. They are very weird shaped, turn on in a very weird fashion, and do not dry hair properly. 9- This hotel felt like a prison. The security guards at the entrance make you feel like you are entering a jail when they inspect the vehicle and none of them speak English. 10- This hotel is for really old people. The hotel does not feel alive. There is no one to be seen at many times in the day and was not a fun atmosphere for kids. 11- The hotel is far from the city where all the shops are located. Each way to and from the hotel costs $20. 12- When checking out, they made a big deal because my bracelet got ripped off while canoeing. Apparently we have to return the bracelet to them at check out and were going to charge us $20 since I didn't have it but I got into an argument with the receptionist and they waived the bogus fee. We really could not take it at this hotel more than two nights. We called the booking company, complained about the hotel and they switched us to an amazing hotel in Cancun named Riu Palace. With the money you pay at this hotel, you can have a much better stay at a different hotel. The manager really seems like he has no idea what's going on in the hotel and it is a very badly managed hotel.

Our reasoning for staying here was simple--you get beach and pool at every resort in Mexico, but here you get beach/pool PLUS rivers to explore, a nature park, and several cenotes, along with some tours you can sign up for. So it was an easy decision for us. There are several restaurants opened at different times--the Italian restaurant PortoBello really is the best one, like others have said. My personal favorite was Cafe de Paris, and my favorite member of staff, was Marco who runs the Cafe. The Cafe is open every evening and simply has fantastic coffee, and little desserts. Marco knows his coffee and will give recommendations about the desserts. The unique thing here is the three rivers and cenotes that are located on the property. You can kayak to one cenote from one river, and then Kayak to several others via the second river (actually kayak to one and then goto others on foot). We only snorkeled in one when we were there, but it all depends on the season, since some of the clarity of the cenotes depend on this. The third river contains no cenotes, and is sometimes inaccessible if the water is too low. We kayaked the third river, but almost got stuck a few times since it was pretty low. There is also a nature park on the premises too. I meant to get up early each morning and hike to the front of the park as there are supposedly monkeys that can be seen early. They have very nice large pools, but I preferred to swim where the rivers met the ocean, as the water was ALOT cooler than the pools. My highest praises to this resort go to the staff and waiters. They are very eager to earn a small tip, and will really go out of there way to accomodate you in any way. I will address two of the issues that i had before I got there and that seems to come up--the beach/ocean and the time share presentation. I was very worried about both of these before arriving. The ocean RIGHT OUT FRONT of the hotel is very brackish because of the organics coming from the rivers. But if you goto either side, the water improves and is very swimmable. We were greeted at the hotel by a staffer, and the time share presentation was brought up, but I declined once, and it wasn't brought back up, so that was relief. Overall, we loved it, and I just think we would bored not having cenotes and kayaking in rivers. It's a big deal for us, which is why we loved this resort. They also had extra stuff like mariachis, brazlian fire dancing, on certain nights that wasn't even announced.

When we asked to be placed in adjoining rooms, we were told that we should have asked for \"connecting rooms\" and because we only asked for \"adjoining\", they would not change our rooms even though there were rooms available!

The bath tub in the room didn't work - there were cracks in the sliding glass doors and windows. The concierges weren't interested in helping you unless you wanted to purchase a timeshare. When you had a question at the front desk, they gave you five different answers. The restaurants were okay - the food and service were hit-or-miss. The beach was HORRIBLE so we went back to Playa del Carmen for swimming and laying out. There was nothing to do when it rained - the only indoor activities consisted of hanging out in the crappy sports bar or spending a fortune at the spa. The timeshare presentation was overly aggressive. I spent a week here and I'm pretty sure I will never come back to any all inclusive resort in Mexico. This resort damaged any positive attitude I might have had about visiting this area!!", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fullerton, California, United States", "Title": "\u201cMarketing pitch left me with a bad taste in my mouth\u201d", "Author": "Janet C", "ReviewID": "UR119339635", "Content": "When I heard that Hacienda Tres Rios was a eco-friendly, sustainable resort, I was so sold on the idea that I overlooked many of the bad reviews.

To be fair, there were some nice things about the resort - they have handmade sopes and quesadillas for breakfast, the service and food by the pool is amazing (pizzas in a wood burning oven, steak sandwiches), the cenotes on site are beautiful, rooms are ok. However, if you are going to do the presentation as part of the marking package, I would just say either pay the extra to not have to do it or just find a different resort. Although they initially told us it would be a 90 minute presentation and you can leave anytime after that, it was actually a three hour presentation and they DO NOT allow you to leave after 90 minutes. Regardless of whether we chose to buy it or not, we were still guests and I expected to be treated as such. They were very rude, made snarky comments about how we don't \"have any money\" and then stormed off and slammed the door in our face when we told them we didn't want to buy. The food at the resort is not great, room service food is worse. If you're going to see the beautiful turquoise waters, this is not the hotel to see them from. Also the location of the hotel is about 15 min from Playa Del Carmen which equals a $20 cab ride each way that can really add up if you want to get away from the terrible food.

In addition to having everything picture perfect (from the presentation of food to the lit-up-dance-floor), the ambiance was a perfect mixture of laid back and warm, welcoming and luxurious. My partner and I come from two different backgrounds: Mexican and Jewish, and when we set out to identify a venue for our wedding we had the additional need of identifying a venue that could accommodate a kosher wedding for about 65 people or so. Though there seemed to be smaller venues that could accommodate a smaller number of people, Hacienda Tres Rios turned out to be the most viable, affordable, and accommodating option. We felt like we hit the lotto after doing a site visit and seeing the property (which is impressive in and of itself with lots of activity options including laying on a semi-secluded beach) and when we met the Chef. Chef Oscar is a real gem. He came with the experience of having worked at an exclusive hotel in Los Angeles that prepares a weekly kosher brunch, and unlike many in this region of Mexico, he already knew the intricacies of kashrut. He even had kosher wine on site for the wedding that we set aside far in advance of the wedding day! At destination weddings (and at weddings in general) the food can often be a toss-up in terms of quality, particularly for kosher events. We were relieved and beyond ecstatic with the feedback from our guests (many of whom were NYC foodies) who said that it was the best meal they had ever had at a wedding -- any wedding, kosher or not. Chef Oscar worked with us to prepare a menu that stayed true to the cuisine of the region while adhering to the strictest standards of kashrut. Allibe, our thoughtful and sweet wedding coordinator from Hacienda Tres Rios, guided us through all aspects of planning our kosher destination wedding, including guidance through the process of choosing credible and affordable local vendors to get all of the details right for the day of our wedding. We had a beautiful chupa complete with music selections of our choosing, wonderful flowers and centerpieces, a traditional Mexican Trio, and a phenomenal photography crew with Rodrigo del Rio Lozano. Allibe was there for every moment of our wedding (including the events before and after our wedding day), making sure that every detail was perfect -- she is truly a consummate professional. Planning a wedding, let alone a destination wedding, can be a challenging, stressful, and difficult undertaking; thanks to Allibe, Luis, and the staff at Hacienda Tres Rios, our planning process was as stress-free as possible, and our wedding was more than we (and our guests) could have possibly hoped for.

I can't say enough good things about this resort! From the moment we got out of the shuttle we were greeted with warm smiles, beautiful weather and an incredible resort. My husband and I are very much into the green aspect of Tres Rios, we were beyond impressed with the extent that this resort has made to not have a negative impact on the environment. There's really nothing bad I can say about the grounds. No, the beach isn't what you see when you open up a tourism booklet for Mexico. That's not to say that the beach is bad though! More like the lakes that we are used to from back home. What the beach lacks, the rest of the resort makes up in spades. There is so much to do there that is included in the all inclusive package that you almost don't need to leave the grounds for any reason! We kayaked through mangroves, played beach volleyball with the staff, swam in the many pools and was always given exceptional service whatever we did. I highly recommend doing the 7 course Chef's Special if you have the extra money for it. Our waiter Martin was amazing and even though I dislike seafood they made a separate menu for me so I could still enjoy my courses. They even topped it off with a cake at the end of it wishing us a happy honeymoon. :) The breakfast buffet was an interesting blend of regular choices alongside traditional mexican fare. Our one waiter Eidgh (I'm sure I'm spelling that wrong, I'm so sorry!!!) was exceptional and made our meals so enjoyable. We had a 1 bedroom suite with a studio off the side and couldn't get over the luxury of the rooms. From the enormous bathroom (almost as large as our living room back home!) to the king sized bed, jacuzzi and huge balcony with a view of the water was the best thing to look at when waking up.

Overall, this was a disappointing experience, although not all together unpleasant. First, the reason we chose the resort was because of our interest in nature and its location on eco preserve. However, the staff did all possible to discourage us from exploring the nature park (by threatening with wild animals). After we took a couple of cenote tours (which were wonderful), I figured out how to get around on my own, but by that time it was almost our day to leave. Similarly with the beach. Not only is the beach not of your typical turquoise color (which is understandable - it is an eco park after all), but they forbid swimming on the beach (stating waves or something else). You are allowed to swim where the river meets the ocean, but the water is much colder there and it is very shallow, so it would not be real swimming. It is a very unique beach , though, because you can snorkel around mangroves there and see some birds and fish. The pool is nice, but not glamorous. And, there is no bathrooms close to the beach or the pool nearest to the beach. So, try drinking a few margaritas, and then going for the bathroom. Also, clean towels are only located in one place, away from the beach and the family pool. The food is nice in terms that although it was all inclusive and unlimited, it was a la carte, so you did not tend to over eat as much. Our favorites were the grill, the pizza, and the Mexican. Asian - not so much. They definitely take spanish speaking people out of turn if you are not looking, so pay attention. The drinks were definitely diluted, but still enjoyable. The amenities: we took advantage of the nature tours. Our package included a free 30 minute massage per person. However, there was still a $12 tax. Not really a lot of money, but not free either. The spa was very nice. The gift shop is super overpriced. The staff: Mostly nice and helpful, but hopeful for a tip. A few dollars goes a long away. especially at the pool. The whole thing with concierge and time shares is really out of control. They would do so much better trying to impress us with the service and the amenities, instead of a sales pitch. Do they think Americans are stupid? When we arrived at the hotel after a 2.5 hour flight, and 45 minute drive, they wanted to give us a 30 minute presentation on the hotel in broken English. Really? With a two year old running around like a maniac? May be you should let us eat lunch first. They try to sell you a time share by inviting you to a \"special\" breakfast and promising you freebies, such as 1 hour massage, lobster dinner, free transportation to town, etc. We did not agree to it. There is a very poor communication of the hotel events: they need a communication board in the lobby. Otherwise, you never know what is about to happen. The clients were also very interesting. There were some people who owned a timeshare, some mexicans on conference or business trips, some mexican families with their children on vacation, and a lot of people from US who paid super low rates in exchange for agreeing to attend a timeshare presentation, but who had no recollection of signing up for anything like that. The room was nice, and fairly comfortable. We had an \"ocean view\", but the water was very far, so I would not recommend paying extra. We basically just had a glimpse of water. The furniture in community spaces was worn out and not comfortable. Hard to imagine that this is a new hotel.

Jesus, the bar tender in the sports bar was GREAT and super funny! The pool staff is Amazing, especially Marvilla and Silverio. Marvin told us that there was transportation to their sister hotel Fishermans through out the day but everytime we asked for it, they would say it was booked. When we would pay for our own cab to get there, we were the only ones there. So, who booked the transportation? Also, we paid for the MEXICAN FIESTA on Thursday night and the pick up time was at 5:30pm in the lobby. We waited until 5:50 until my brother decided to ask where the transportation was and we were told the Mexican Fiesta was cancelled. They were very unapologetic for not letting us know in advance and then they said they could not reimburse us but we could get our money applied towards spa services. When we ate at the Mexican restaurant, the food made my brother and husband sick. We cancelled our timeshare presentation because we got food poisoning and Marvin threw a fit. I told him we would reschedule for monday. We still were feeling ill so I offered to come alone to the presentation and Marvin quickly gave me attitude. He said my husband NEEDED to be there and that I could not come alone. I told him that I was going to get a massage and then we can discuss rescheduling and he said\" you can forget about the spa services, if you don't go to the presentation.\" I thought my spa services were for the Mexican FIesta? Well he made it clear to the spa that my services were not to be comped. Also, when I requested transportation to fishermans he told me that they were booked and then hung up on me. I can not believe that they have an individual such as this working with the guests. He was great and all smiles until we cancelled the timeshare presentation and then made our stay a living hell.

Negatives: - Really poor choice of food - very basic breakfast and lunch (far worse than options at similarly priced all-inclusive resorts) - For dinner - only 1-2 restaurants are open, dining options are very basic - One kitchen serves all restaurants and it shows; food at the asian restaurant was very poor - The staff often do not know what restaurants / activities are open; would give contradicting or incorrect information Recommendations: The resort is built well and could really compete with the premium resorts in the area. The owners should \"steal\" experienced management from well-run resorts (Secrets, Excellence, etc) to make things run better, improve food options (variety and quality), improve service, even if it means charging more.

If you're looking for crystal blue waters and a great beach, this ain't the place. If you want a lot of night life at the resort, like shows, nightclub, comedy, etc., this ain't the place for that either. However, the pools and restaurants make up for everything that is lacking otherwise. The buffet is good, especially for breakfast. The lobster (you must tell them you want lobster by 2:00 the same day) is fabulous. The Asian restaurant is top notch, as is the Italian and Mexican. The outside Grille, poolside, serves everything from Sea Bass to Hamburgers all day long. There's a brick oven pizzeria that you can dine at or order poolside. Great calzones too! Men must wear slacks in the Asian and Italian Restaurants and no kids allowed in the Italian. The Wine list is adequate, yet falls short of top notch. There is a Coffee Shop just off the lobby that serves wonderful capucinno and expresso as well as an outstanding array of desserts, pastries and chocolates. The gift shop is nice, but overpriced. The Sports Bar is sub par, but no real activities there during the evening, other than an occasional karaoke night. No night life worth mentioning. One night was a Beach Fiesta which was nice with a live band and the welcome party offered a good Mariacchi Band as well. The Kids Club is great for kiddos 4-12 and they can be entertained all day from 10a.m. til 6p.m. with games, crafts and pool and beach activities. The rooms are nice and updated, especially the 2 bedroom suites which we enjoyed and highly recommend if more than 3 in your party. The internet wireless connection is hit and miss, especially poolside, but even as I write this in the room it sometimes loses connectivity. Don't bother bringing your Region 1 DVDs as they probably won't work in the in room dvd players. Expect to walk quite a bit from your room to the lobby and/or pool area but it's not too bad. Most rooms do not have much of an ocean view, but the grounds and pool offer more than an adequate view. You will not be close to anything and unless you rent a car you must take at least a $20 taxi ride to any place. We did not rent a car and unless you plan on doing a lot of site seeing outside arranged excursions which provide transportation), you probably wont miss having one. Back to the pools: There is an adult only section as well as acres of other pools for either quite time or volleyball. The poolside lacks any sort of music and one guy in our party had a boom box which I would suggest bringing. Poolside bar service was great.

Just can't understand some of the negative reviews related to this resort. Yes, we were prepared for the poor ocean/beach quality. But people did swim in it. (It's actually pulp from Mangroves. Feels like mush when you walk in it.) It doesn't smell, as some reviews state. Plus there is a wonderfully refreshing area to swim in at the North end of the resort. Plenty big enough for everyone. And with the two wonderful pools on the resort, who could ask for more? The resort grounds are so clean and beautifully well-manicured. The service was impeccable. Everyone was so friendly. Always an \u201chola\u201d or \u201cBuenos dias\u201d. We didn\u2019t want for anything. The pillow menu was great. The food at all of the restaurants was fabulous\u2026so many choices that were terrific\u2026it was hard to make decisions on what to order. Our favorite was the Italian restaurant. We ordered late night room service several times. Loved the cheesecake. The nachos from the Hacienda Grill were so yummy. Great to eat on the Beach beds while enjoying the ocean view and breeze. Do check out the margharita pizza from the Il Forno grill. We do want to recognize the BEST beach waiter: Jose Luis. That man works so hard\u2026always running! He remembered our drinks preferences from one day to the next. Also asked about the others in our party if they weren\u2019t with us. Jose Luis is AWESOME. We would move to the other side of the beach, if we weren\u2019t in Jose Luis\u2019s service area\u2026he\u2019s that good. Bali is a good second. Very friendly and talkative. We took several of the tours. The Senses Tour is relaxing and enjoyable. A must-do is the Jaguar Tour. Mo and Andres were our tour guides for that tour. They are terrific\u2026very fun! Seem to love their job. Mo also was one of our tour guides for our Kayak Tour, as was David. Can\u2019t say enough good things about these three men. They always had a friendly, warm thing to say when we would run into them around the resort. Zena took us on our Bicycle Tour. It was warm, keep in mind it\u2019s the rainy season and very humid. But she made the tour fun and very informative. Mauricio (Mauw) (sp?) gave us our ride on the catamaran. He definitely loves his job. Thanks for allowing us to jump off and swim around out in the ocean, awhile. Frequently saw Chef Oscar out and about making sure everything was running smoothly. We attended several of the resort activities\u2026cocktail lessons, sushi lessons etc. They were all fun\u2026and tasty. But our favorite was the Tequila Tastings. WOW! We learned so much about different tequilas and how to properly judge them. Chef Oscar taught that class and was such an entertainer. What fun we had! You MUST do the Tequila Tasting! The only negative thing I can say is that we wish we had more time at the resort. Would have loved to spend more time walking around the park\u2026and swimming in the cenotes.

There were 29 of us, ranging in age from 3-80. We had a wonderful time! The staff at this resort are excellent. The grounds are very clean. The rooms were nice, and were cleaned thoroughly every day. I left my watch out on the table one morning while I went to the pool. When I returned to my freshly cleaned room, instead of finding my watch stolen, It was placed on top of a note asking me to please secure my valuables in the complimentary safe. I have read reviews of people at other resorts getting their valuables stolen. SO this was a nice surprise. The pools are great. We spent a lot of time lounging at the pool and relaxing. The workers are always stopping by to see if you need anything. We ordered dozens of drinks at a time and always got we ordered in a timely manner. You can even have them bring you food. Whatever you want, sometimes even if its not on the menu. The food was amazing. There are a few high end restaurants, a buffet, a pizza hut, and an outdoor grill. Make sure to bring some nice clothes, as there is a dress code for the nicer restaurants. I was always extremely satisfied with what I ordered every single time. The only real downside was the ocean. The beach was not very nice. Instead of sand under the water it was a sort of mucky clay. We only went in the ocean once when I was there. BUT...there is a nice area where the river meets the ocean. You can hop in here to cool off, or get in a kayak and paddle to one of the many cenotes on site. I wish they had a swim-up bar as well. But the staff will serve you drinks while you are in the pool, so I suppose it wasnt really necessary. Overall, this is a nice, small, quiet resort. There is no waiting in lines to eat, or waking up early to save a spot by the pool or ocean. That has been a VERY annoying issue at other resorts I have stayed at in Riviera Maya. I would recommend this resort for family's or anyone that wants to relax and be pampered. ADVICE: Although tips are included in the all inclusive package, its always nice to reward the workers with a few dollars when they are going above and beyond. They will remember your tips and give you special attention for the rest of your stay.

It seems to me that the owners ran out of money when developing this hotel or did not spend enough time looking at their competition. It is lacking a decent swimming pool and nice restaurants. There is only one decent Italian restaurant, a buffet, Chinese and a small outdoor grill. I was not impressed with the food at all except for the 7 course meal we had comped from all of our complaints. I have to say that Chef Oscar is amazing and Jose Luis is a real stand up guy. When we arrived we were told that we had a Jacuzzi room, but we ended up with a crappy studio. Once I told Jose Luis about the problem he actually made it right and upgraded us to a nice one bedroom. The best part about this resort is the quality of their rooms, but other than that I was very disappointed in the place. It lacked character and activities. When you read about the 300+ acres and the cenotes it seems like it has this wonderful jungle that you can explore and swim in the cenotes. Not at all, there are 300+ acres of unusable land. The small cenotes takes about 20 minutes to swim through and you will have about 50 mosquito bites by the time you get to the end. Other than that there is nothing to do in this resort. There are only two small pools with a very small bar that is overcrowded so it takes way too long to even get a drink. No swim-up bar like most resorts in that area and you can only see the water from one of the pools. The hotel is located about 1/2 mile back from the beach so there are NO ocean front rooms and the beach is unusable. The spa is extremely small and does not offer much, especially for the price. After Tres Rios, I spent a 2nd week at El Dorado Royal and this was an amazing resort. You have to stay in an ocean front Casita!!

Our first stay in May 2010 was thoroughly enjoyable but this stay was even better. We would unhesitantly recommend this resort for anyone wanting a five crown resort experience. We were celebrating our 20th anniversary with family and close friends. We had a party of fourteen occupying one two bedroom and four studios. Our experience exceeded our expectations. Everyone rated the Tres Rios as a 10 or better. The lodging facilities were the same quality as on our previous experience but the housekeeping seemed more detailed. The rooms and suite were comfortable and provided a private meeting place for everyone to interact. The room service was reliable and the menu exotic and tasty. Having 24 hour room service is a definite plus. Our compliments to Oscar, the head chef, and Sammy, the manager of food services. You are doing a superb job. The menus are varied, complicated, and extensive. Each and every night we had a reserved table waiting for our party of fourteen. We usually had their suggested menu and every meal was delicious. We appreciated not having to split up our party. We were welcomed and made to feel special. Our servers were attentive, hospitable, reliable, and conscientious. Trinidad, Gregorio, and Claudia are a superb wait staff. Twice we had Mayan Coffee made by Justine. It was quite a treat. On our final night we had a special dinner by the river made by Becky. It was a memorable farewell. We appreciated Oscar and Sammy regularly checking in with us. The food was fabulous. Further kudos go to Jose Luis - Customer Service, Yadira - Head Concierge, Paula Talavera - Member Service Manager, and Juan - Tours. They did everything to make our stay enjoyable and satisfying. Finally, our compliments go to German Fayad, Director of Operations. It was refreshing to see the director constantly supervising the staff and facilities. It communicated the impression that management took pride in Tres Rios, and were always striving to make improvements. This was evident when we suggested to German Fayed that there should be a dedicated phone line for guests who had medical emergencies. Within 24 hours, he communicated with us that they were already working on establishing a dedicated medical emergency line directly to the on site infirmary. It was reassuring to learn that there are on site medical facilities. If you want a unique experience, we suggest that you book a yacht and go to Isla Mujeres. The water was an exquisite array of colors. We went out on the yacht, The Dreamer, to renew our vows.

Every single aspect of the infrastructure of this place is well thought of. Positives: rooms are AMAZING!!! Perfection is the word to describe the rooms. The spa was by far the greatest spa in the world! The cenotes and kayaking were top of the line... it was a great combination wild life and luxury... The people were great. The managers, especially, Martin Mendicta. He totally went out of his way to help us. We lost our camera and he assisted us in every way he can to search for our camera including calling it in his walkie-talkie radio. He greeted us everytime we saw him. He is a manager but yet everytime we saw him, he was helping someone... He gave every person on vacation the best possible service one can give. We commend him for his work ethics. Another person worth mentioning is Carlos Pritondo (spelling unsure) - the manager of the Mexican restaurant. The management of this resort did not invest in soda machines and serves soda from 2L bottles.. usually, it is flat by the time it gets to the table. We asked Carlos if he would give us canned soda. He went out of his way to ensure we got our canned sodas... Everytime we came in to eat, he made sure we had canned sodas. Exceptional service. he treated us like royalty and made our dining experience suberb. The facilities in the resort are top of the line... everything is first class. Negative: 1. The biggest problem I didn't like is the fact that breakfast sucked. If you want omelette, they lady that cooked it flipped the egg with her bare hands - she touched food without any gloves and quite frankly looked unsanitary. Management should at least issue these employees cooking in front of customers gloves. Breakfast was served only buffet style... half the time, the food is cold. The only thing you can get hot is the omelette which takes 10 minutes to get and you get a omelette cooked by a girl who is not wearing gloves. 2. easy fix - Front desk does not have change for $20. At this resort, we like to tip our servers for their hard work and great service - naturally, we like change for bigger bills to allow us to tip properly... today, we cannot get change for $20. We overheard another customer who ended up tipping his cab driver more than he wanted because the front desk does not have change fo $50 dollars. with all the investment they put on the property, i suggest that they put ONE change machine in the lobby 3. soda - they should get soda fountain machines or just serve canned sodas... the soda was flat all the time. these are cheap investments that would satisfy and eliminate a lot of complains.. 4. sales people - be prepared to get sales talked by a time share representative. avoid it at all possible cause. it's a total waste of time. 5. Room service - horrible. very slow and food is ALWAYS cold. suggestion to management - if you expect room service to take at least 30 minutes, usually 1 hour (even for just drinks), put a microwave in the room so we can heat up our food.

It is still pretty new, so the whole resort is in great condition and well-maintained. We were welcomed in the lobby with a fresh fruit drink and a damp washcloth after the drive from the airport. Check in was quick, and our luggage was taken straight to our room. They did want us to see the concierge first to \"tell us more about the resort\", but from the reviews I knew this was only to set up the timeshare presentation. Luckily, they were going home for the day, so when we did stop by the next day we just declined the things they were offering for us to go to the timeshare presentation, and they really didn't push us any further. Timeshares just aren't for us. The room we were given was very nice and big! We had the mangrove view, which was fine by me and we could see the ocean also. The beds were comfy, there was a flat screen TV, the bathroom area was nice, and there was free wi-fi too! We didn't spend too much time in the room, but it was very comfortable! There is a stocked mini fridge too, which was handy. The pool area is awesome!! Two large free-form pools, and plenty of pool lounges. No getting up at 7 am to \"reserve\" your chairs!! It never felt crowded at all during our stay, and the pool by the outdoor Hacienda Grill restaurant was more quiet than the one closer to the beach. There was no swim up bar, which was OK by me as drunk people tend to congregate by them in my experience. But the waiters and waitresses who bring drinks to you work very hard and are really awesome! They will also bring food to you from either the Hacienda Grill or the brick oven pizza restaurant nearby!!! The ultimate for relaxation!! The restaurants were very, very good in my opinion. We ate breakfast in either the buffet or the Hacienda Grill, and both were great. The lady in the buffet restaurant making omelets, sopes, etc was fantastic! The food at the buffet was good and the selection was diverse. Hacienda Grill was a nice breakfast spot too, next to the pool. For lunch we ate at either the Hacienda Grill or had a pizza/calzone from the brick oven restaurant. The Mexican specialty restaurant above the lobby also has lunch, buffet style, and I recommend it also! The dinner restaurants were great - the Asian restaurant, the Mexican specialty restaurant and the Italian restaurant. I thought the food, presentation, and service was very good in all of them. It may not be 5-star gourmet, but very good all the same! (And I'm a bit picky about resort food after having one bad experience at another resort.) Not all the restaurants are open every night, so check with the concierge. Guys have to wear long pants and no sandals. They also have two outdoor buffets during the week. We really liked the bakery/ coffee shop off the lobby that was open in the afternoon and evening and served pastries, cookies, etc. It was fun to pop in a grab a few treats! There's not a lot to do in the evening, so if you are expecting a party place you will be disappointed. They had a few shows to see (the \"Cirque de Soleil\" type show was pretty cool), and there is a sports bar with a pool table and flat screens. They had a casino night one evening also. This really is mainly a family resort, not the get drunk and party every night resort. The beach, as others have said, is OK for hanging out, especially with the beach beds, but the water is not the crystal clear blue of other places. They did have a guy to take you out on the catamaran, which was fun. And the snorkeling in the cenotes on the property is a must do! Overall, this is a great resort in my opinion. Everyone that works there is great, always a smile and a greeting, and always helpful. We took about $140 in ones for tips, I believe that a nice tip goes a long way, and is appreciated because many people think tips are included somehow. Everyone works so hard, and I can't believe they get paid too much, so it is the right thing to do!

He may even show you some table magic tricks :). We enjoyed dining with him on several occassions. The Ilforno Pizzeria by the pool makes exceptional calzones and pizza. Casamrio, poolside bartender, makes a great beachcomber and pina colada. He has a great sense of humor and always remembered what we liked. He was a pleasure to chat with each day. Valerino and Oscar were poolside waiters who worked diligently to make sure we always had what we needed. Their smiles and daily banter were great!

We were so busy we missed many of the All Inclusive activities included in the package, which we hope to take advantage of if we return someday. We did utilize the Jaguar tour which included a visit to the nursery, where they raise exotic plants for this and future resorts, kayaking. and a swim in a smaller Cenote. We missed all the shows provided, as they tended to occur when we were on a tour or having a delightful dinner. We especially enjoyed the Kotori restaurant, also known as the Asian Fusion. The Sushi, sashimi, soups, and fresh seared Ahi Tuna was incredible. Our next favorite was the Hacienda Grill, noted for their tasty Rib Eye steaks, yum, yum, and for breakfast my favorite being Eggs Benedict! The buffets in the main dining room were always full of quality choices for all three meals. We thought the Italian restaurant needed a better menu selection. The Mexican restaurant had the best bar tender, Teo, specializing in an Ameretto Mango Margarita! The drinks and service everywhere were outstanding! Being a Grand Mayan member we were not interested in their fractional interest membership program, however, at the end of the presentation they invited us back with a similar attractive package. We declined because you had to use it within two years and pay up front and we did not want to be in that position to return in such a short time period, with so many other places to travel on our bucket list. Our biggest complaint is the trickery the IRC vacation marketing company used to force us in attending the presentation. After agreeing to the package offered, paying in full up front, and then being told they could not confirm our reservations until we booked our flights and provided them with our itinerary. After booking flights, they then sent us a notice to be signed indicating a \"Mandatory\" attendance to the presentation was required, otherwise our package price would be doubled? I was furious, no mention of this upfront and we were now pregnant with non refundable air fares and for the package price. I wrote a letter to the sales manager, who never replied, nor would any other executive of IRC? Listen I'm not naive, almost all resorts in Mexico have presentations, however, this is almost always optional to attend? To me and my wife this is an extremely poor marketing technique used to get us in to their resort, and certainly leaves you with a negative attitude toward any kind of purchase. Also the so called 90 minute presentation took over four hours, and 53 no's to get excused! They also put down the value of our Grand Mayan Luxxe program which is top of the line, anther turn off. The only other negative was despite making reservations nine months in advance, we got a low level room with a partial view and twin beds rather than a King bed as requested, although the room was spacious, attractive and comfortable. Despite the negatives which exist on all timeshare/fractional interest resorts we had a wonderful time, great food and plenty of drinks. P.S. we took two tours, both lasting most of the day. The Isla Mujeres tour which was fun, and the Chichin Itsa tour which was 13.5 hours long, very tiring, don't do it on your last day, as we did, but a once in a lifetime experience. We do hope to return to the area sometime in the future, and certainly it would be difficult to top this resort for quality and beauty.

Later in the week, we ventured down to Playa Del Carmen (about a 15 minute cab ride) and discovered that the beach could be even better. Actually, near perfect sand. The beach at Tres Rios actually accumulates a lot of black seaweed and crap that the crews are continuously raking up and carting away in wheelbarrows. The staff at Hacienda Tres Rios were all terrific. Very eager to please (with one exception, but every place has one of them). The restaurants didn't offer a full assortment of what we consider to be traditional Mexican food. There were no burritos, tacos, enchiladas, etc. Our 7 year old daughter could spend every day split between the beach and the pools. Easy to please, that way.

The food was great from the poolside pizzeria and grill. The wait staff was very friendly and helpful. I recommend tipping the wait staff for a much more enjoyable service. Waiter Oscar was very good to us the entire stay. We enjoyed the pool every day. The massage in the salon was great. We recommend kayaking in the cenote on resort. Maya did a great job with the tour. The restaurant was great. The resort is absolutely beautiful top to bottom. The rooms are the nicest I have seen at a resort. There is alot of wildlife on the resort including fish in the waterway on the resort, iguanas on the pool deck and these awesome marsupials that look like raccoons. They have one named Pecho that hangs around the Pizzeria. Check him out. The only down side was the ocean water. It is not clear on the resort front. This is due to the levies installed to protect the cenote and mangroves. However, you can walk south 300 yards and have gorgeous beaches. The cenote has clear water where it meets the ocean and is accessible and refreshing. Overall we enjoyed our stay at HTR. Staff were great, food was great.

The rooms were clean and comfortable, as well as nicely decorated. We spent a lot of time out on the balcony of the room, I don't believe there are any bad views, mostly because of the fact that the grounds of the resort are so lush and beautiful. The customer service was exceptional. We had an activity day planned outside of the resort and and the company with whom we booked it failed to pick us up. We just went to the travel desk near the lobby and told them the situation. The instantly were able to find a couple of empty seats on a similar activity and we left fifteen minutes later. One tip is to bring a watch and set it to the right time zone, there aren't many clocks around the resort and we ended up asking the concierge multiple times what time it was. We went on the Jaguar Tour, which is free with an all inclusive package, and it was a great experience, made even better with an underwater camera....by the beach, there are kayaks that you may take out, and it's definitely worth it to schedule a ride on the Catamaran! It's not difficult to fit in and the guides are all wonderfully polite and personable. We took advantage of the adults-only pools because they were almost always empty and peaceful, while the kids pools were almost always busy. The food was all Great! We went to the buffet everyday for breakfast, the pizza place by the pools, Hacienda Grill, Kotori, El Alebrije, the sports bar, and got room service several times. Some things that stood out were the cheesecake and steak sandwiches on the room service menu, the French toast and fruit at the breakfast buffet and the Margerita pizza from Il Forno. All in all, the entire resort was beautiful and hospitality was definitely the main focus of the staff. Also, you get the opportunity to see iguanas, lizards, birds, and coatis daily.

It was just wonderful. This place is not for partiers. It is quiet, and romantic. The room was spacious and beautiful. We had a jacuzzi tub on our deck, which was fun. The grounds where lovely with foliage, and flowers everywhere. The pool just goes on forever. There are 2 beach areas. The main one has the beach beds on it. I recommend getting up early to snag one. we got up one morning at 6:30, and they where just putting the new sheets on them. we slept peacefully and luxuriously thre rest of the morning! I highly recommend it! The water here is not very clear and beautiful, but the quiet, and the beds make up for it. The other beach is across the bridge, and it is where the 2 rivers come out to thre sea. The water here is gorgeous, and this is where most people swam. It is shallow and calm and would be a good place for small children to get into the water. One day we took a kayak up the main river to the cenote where it originates, and back. That was very fun. One day we took the bicycle tour to see all of the cenotes on the property. One we knew how to get to them, we hiked back later and swam in them. they are beautiful, and refreshing on a hot day. The hotel web site made it sound like they have bikes, and snorkel gear readily available for use, but you can only use them on the tours. so bring your own snorkel gear if you want to do it on your own. The hotel tours are free, but not offered every day. There are basically 3 formal dining rooms, one open each night; Italian, Asian Fusion, and Gourmet Mexican. They are all pretty comparable inquality. I am a foody, and hold a high standard. with that in mind; the food was good. Not great, but we were not disappionted in any way, just didn't knock my socks off. The pizza place outside is very good, as is the poolside restaurant, which was definately better that expected. The property and rooms where very clean and always smelled fresh. One suggestion I have for the management however is that there were several beds on the beach that did not have mattresses or covers on them. Either repair them or remove them, as they make the place look a bit run down. everything else was great! oh, and our package came with 2 half hour massages.

Big thanks to Carisimo - he was awesome by the pool! The room itself was clean and beautiful. Housekeeping were so great - we needed hypoallergenic pillows and it was no problem at short notice. Bathrooms are lovely despite not having a bath tub in the mangrove view rooms. The resort goes to great lengths to organise activities and make the stay enjoyable for everyone. We didn't end up having time to do these but hear they were lovely. We did, however, attend all the dinners they hosted - including Carribean night on the beach. Go to these - they are great fun and the food is delicious. We had the all-inclusive package so tried almost all of the foods they had on offer. Breakfast buffet was top notch and the quesadilla/omelette station was awesome. Lunch at the wood fired pizza oven was great too. Hacienda Grill offers nice lunches or light dinners. One of the disappointing things was the dinner buffet - it was trying too hard to be American and I probably would have preferred more Mexican options there but I guess they have to cater to everyone. Bad things: Not many. Honest. When we booked we noted that it was our honeymoon and heard that they do 'special' things for you on your honeymoon so we were excited. When we arrived the fellow at the reception desk - who was quite arrogant - made no point of this so I reminded him that it was our honeymoon. He gave a very condescending smile and said 'OK'...and that was all. Nothing special in our room, no treats, etc. I guess I expected a bit more from a 5 star place.

We had booked a one week stay at a different resort (which was advertised \"5-Star\") and were headed there when we met a Rep from Tres Rios, who offered us several incentives to go on a tour of the Tres Rios property. What attracted me most to T.R. was learning that it is located on a huge Ecological Preserve. We checked into our so-called \"5-Star\" destination. We were disappointed! It turned out to be more like 3 Stars. It was noisy and crowded, the food was crappy and service was mediocre. We had pre-paid and there was no way to get out of it. A couple of days later, we went to Tres Rios for our tour/sales presentation. Based on the place where we were staying, I had no interest in buying, but we wanted to see what a different resort was like. Arriving at the gated entry of Tres Rios Resort, we were stopped by Security to be checked in (unlike the \"other\" place). We then drove through a jungle road for approximately 5 minutes before we actually saw the Resort. Driving up to the entrance, we immediately felt a huge difference. The Valets greeted us with big smiles as they rushed to open the car doors (the \"other\" resort had Self parking). They spoke English, which was helpful. I noticed the gorgeous, wide mahogany steps and porch as we entered. We were directed to some comfortable sofas and were offered a beverage. Within a few minutes, our Sales Rep, Daniel, came. He was tall, handsome and well-dressed, with a big beautiful smile. It was a pleasure to tour the property with Daniel (who spoke perfect English). He took us to one of the restaurants on the property where we had a delicious lunch. From that point on, we were impressed by everything we saw. The resort was beyond beautiful!! It was quiet and not crowded. The rooms were spacious and well appointed. The amenities were so wonderful - lovely landscapes, a \"Quiet\" pool, beds on the beach, several restaurants, 24-hour room service, the amazing rivers and cenotes and much more. All food, beverages, activities and amenities all-included for a surprisingly affordable rate. We decided to purchase a membership! Unlike a Time Share, you can reserve your time at Tres Rios any week(s) of the year. Skipping ahead, Daniel offered us a special room rate, so we decided to stay a few extra days in Playa del Carmen so that we could check out Tres Rios first hand. It was all we expected and more!

Right off the bat we were told that we would have to speak with a concierge AKA timeshare shark AARRGGHH! We knew this resort was going to pitch this so we told her that we had a timeshare before and dumped it 3 years ago she left us alone. Our first meal was the buffet which was clean with good service,but not alot of choices compared to other places I have been. Off to the beach beds what a great invention!! you can eat,sleep or just relax they were so comfortable we got one everyday. We ate that night at Portobella aka Italian restaurant food,atmosphere and presentation all were great! We ate lunch most days at the Hacienda Grill which was the only outdoor dining by the pools it was good,however by the end of the week the menu choices dry up and this is the only lunch besides the buffet that is available. I wish they had a regular evening restaurant open some days for variety's sake. We loved the Mexican restaurant and met our favorite waiter Daemo he is great reminicent of cruiseship or fine dining quality of attentiveness we followed him for the rest of our stay. The room was very nice we had 2206 which had a oceanview and was centrally located. The bed was great!! the best ever in Mexico the bathroom also received high marks as well. The overall staff was great always willing to do what you desired with a smile. The one downside is the color of the water at the beach brown due to river runoff I knew this prior to booking,but at the end of the week I missed the clear waters of Playa. Entertainment was a bust lame shows or the sports bar or go to bed early those are your choices. This resort is good to relax the kids will like the pools and the drinks are very good,however if you want to do more you will need to catch a cab to Playa or Cancun for something to do. One thing I noticed I know this is tips prepaid resort but we always tip the hardworking people wherever we go the $200 or so dollars we gave to these people means nothing to me but it goes a long way with them and it's appreciated.

Can't say anything bad about the staff either - I didn't have too many interactions with them, bur everytime we needed anything they were eager to help. Now - the negatives...The biggest one certainly is the beach. Unusable...I've read the reviews of course, but kept hoping people just were being picky and spoiled. It's not the case. The waves wash ashore this brownish matter that varies from an oil spill -like in some spots to a light brown mess in others. Nobody wants to swim in this, trust me... So, repeating the others - if you really want a nice beach - go somewhere else. Yes, you will have a river to swim in with a crystal clear water, but it's not the same. The beach issue affects other hotels in the area as well - I saw the same thing as I walked up the shore. It improves the furhter you get away from HTR , but it's a long walk... Another minor note.

When I was ready to go to the attraction and get the tickets I actually had to pay $36 each. Their answer was \"you just have to pay for the buffet\" When I got there I found every hotel offers the same discount and it was impossible for the 3 of us to eat $108 of breakfast and lunch in a Mexican amusement park. I was scammed the moment I walked in the door. The junior suite was quite junior, like a Marriot hotel room. The beach is a mess, it is not polluted but just a swampy mess compared to the other beaches. The explanation they give for this is they are an eco-park. And they must abide by regulations that do not allow for artificial removal of the marine life that live in the floating mess in the surf and on the sand in front of the property. The location is far enough from town (20 min) that it is inconvenient to go into town everyday where you can find the good food and the $25 an hour massages. (I got 6 hours in 3 days) I ate at 4 of the 6 food establishments on the property and they were mediocre at best but the price was like I was in Aspen. It was $17.50 for a hot dog at the pool. $8 -$9 drinks like a Vegas pool. $150 for 3 at the Italian restaurant. The spa has Beverly Hills prices. Although I hung the privacy sign on the door each day, for some reason the maid ignored it and changed the linens and turned the bed down each night. Once we were nude in the tub and 2 other times I was sleeping. I suspect it was to refill the minibar in hopes I would burn through a few hundred in high price mini bar treats. The time share presentation was miserable also, it was supposed to be 90 minutes but as soon as they found out I had an excursion scheduled for 2 hours after the meeting started they canceled it because they new they would trap us there for 5 hours. This was my first time to this area of Mexico, it was quite a bit different than the more primitive trips I have taken in this country and even Cabo. It is a tourist trap, literally. You are bombarded with \"representatives\" making grandiose offers that are too good to be true, and everyone has their hand out trying to get your money one way or another. My best experience on this trip was the scuba diving in Cozumel, take the ferry over and check that out. Also diving and snorkeling in the Cenotes was not to be missed.

At the presentation we were promised that the certificate is good for any time of year. The hotel manager refused to grant us drop off back at the Cancun airport. We were told at the presentation that the pickup and drop off is included. At presentation we were told that the certificate gives us the same benefits that we would get if we owned time share at the Hotel. That was not true since transportation to Playa Del Carmen was not granted to us - only for Time Shares. The same apply to tour discounts. Manager explained to us that this is agency's fault. I do not think that this is entirely true since the Hotel is using the Agency to feel the rooms. Speaking about Time Share deals that they have: They offered us a deal for 30 year, no maintenance, flexible week. For 20,000 USD. At best, we would probably visit the property half of the time (15 times). Considering average stock market return of 10% a year, the 20,000 over 30 year period would of return $200,000 inflation adjusted.

We have been exchanging for all-inclusives since 1989. This place reminded us of the very first few exchanges we made way back then when the concept of all-inclusive was a new one and everyone had to work it out. HTR has a lot to work out!!! 1.) Drinks - advertised international premium brands but even when you asked for Jack Daniel they still gave you the local brand, and that was true at every restaurant and bar. Their failure to produce as advertised caused you to continually confront and get into arguments. 2.) This is an all-inclusive that advertised tips included. But their workers all expect tips per duty performed even miner ones, which again is something we saw way back in the beginning of all-inclusives. Not to say through the years we haven' tipped at all-inclusives but it was for exemplary service, food and drinks. 3.) Food presentations were truly lovely but choices were really out there. My family eats simple meat and potato things. We all went to the Mexican Restaurant and no one could find anything that they wanted to order from the menu. I had to ask what could we have that was just plain simple beef? We were then offered beef fajitas and my kids were happy. We never ate at the Asian Restaurant because my husband and I scoped out the menu ahead of time and found nothing to order as written. The Italian restaurant entrees were our favorite, but we all created our own combos from the menu choices. Their desserts were the best!!!! Ask for Gabriel - he does a great flaubee. The Hacienda Grill was my husbands favorite cause you could dress casual there. 4.) The Mexican, Asian and Italian really make the men and the teenagers dress to eat there....but their flexibility is a little off. They insist on pants but jeans are accepted. As for tops, my guys got in with polo shirts, and even solid v-neck t-shirts. For shoes, dock-siders were allowed but not sandals or sneakers. 5.) The Paris Cafe was a favorite. Xavier could be bribbed to produce a plate of chocolate covered strawberries just for me for a $5 tip nightly. Well that were some highlights - all in all - the hassels that you had to go through all the time were frustrating!!! As for value this was the most expensive time share all inclusive we have ever spent. Definitely not worth the additional amount. Perhaps if it was like a $1,000 dollars cheaper than the others then maybe the shortfalls could be justified.

DON'T DO IT! it took 4hrs and they bring you to what I call the \"Torture room\" at the end. We were promised 2 people paid golfing and they even set up the tee time. The next day my husband and son excited to golf find out AFTER they get to the unpromised golf resort that it was going to not only cost them another $100 bucks but also $60 for shoes...now remember they were sent to another course that was not as good. I voiced respectfully my concerns and the resort did not care. I was once proud to be going to HTR but now realized they only want you to buy into them. Beach is horrible and steam hut not working and half the activities not available as they say on website. I am not a hard person to please but this trip was a very special trip for my family and I work hard for my money so when I spend that much I do expect quality and you don't get what you see on website.", "Date": "April 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Carolina, USA", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Resort\u201d", "Author": "lockwoodsam", "ReviewID": "UR103929209", "Content": "My wife and I are frequest travelers to Mexico and enjoy all-inclusive.

I will preface this review by telling you the dynamic of our party. I traveled with my wife (I am 31 and my wife is 28) and what was supposed to be another couple but turned out to just be one of them. By no means were we looking for a week long drunk fest but what we found here was not exactly what we were looking for which was a relaxing week in paradise. Rooms: The rooms are top notch. Definitely the highlight of the resort. The resorts website gives a pretty accurate description of the rooms. We had a huge suite (one of the biggest on the resort I believe) and an adjoining room for the other couple. We had a jetted jacuzzi overlooking the ocean literally 3 steps from my side of the California king size bed. The beds are pillow top and very comfortable. The bathrooms were the size of my bedroom at home and it featured a separate toilet area and a huge shower with beautiful tile everywhere. Maid service was excellent and they even come by nightly for turn down service. Unfortunately we didnt come to Mexico to spend a week in our room... Upon arrival we were greeted by Mariana at the front desk. We arrived around 7pm. She got us checked in and gave us our all inclusive bracelets. We immediately went to our room(s) and ordered room service. The room service was fabulous ( I will touch on the food more later) the first night. The next day as we were waiting for the rest of our party we hung out at the pool. There is an adult only pool which no one adhered to the \"adult only\" part. The other pool is clearly where all the action is. Daily water polo, water volleyball games etc. The pool side service is ok I guess. There is a slew of guys always coming around wanting to get you a drink. As another reviewer posted they use plastic cups that I personally witnessed not being washed. They dip just the rim in a sanitizer solution very briefly. I also witnessed them filter water out of cups with their hands to re-use the ice. I ALSO witnessed the waiters re-use limes that hadnt been squeezed. This became a reoccuring theme. The waiters (not all because I talked to a few and some of them are genuinely sweet and honest hard workers) are sleaze balls. I witnessed several of them just staring at girls in bikinis and giving preferential treatment to \"hot\" younger girls. In one instance they kept calling one of the ladies in our party \"lady\" so she responded by calling him \"guy\". Now I know we are \"gringos\" and dont know a ton of spanish but I clearly heard him call her a derogatory name. I dont need to know a bunch of spanish to know that it was the equivalent to a \"female dog\" in english. The timeshare presentation: So we were staying on an RCI exchange. There were no problems booking or exchanging. No issues checking in or different treatment being an exchange so that was good. I was supposed to attend the presentation one day but my wife wanted no part of it. The refused to let me do it because she wouldnt attend. Ok. Fine with me. lol. At this point it was a few days into our trip and I knew there was a zero chance of buying here because it just wasnt for us, so I was ok with this. I dont think they were. Our initial concierge Helen was nice. She greeted us the first day with a bunch of brochures and information about the resort etc. Everything else they did was with the obvious intention of getting us to that presentation. Helen was off for a couple days during our stay and we were helped by Nora. I found Nora to be very \"in your face\" and borderline rude (sorry Nora). Anyways, they were of no help during our stay. Upon initial meeting with Helen we were given \"gold bracelets\" on top of our all inclusive bracelets. These were supposed to be so we could experience what owners experience. Special perks etc. They were absolutely worthless. The concierges dont help you experience the area by GENUINELY helping you find the cheapest ways to get around or to go out to see the sites or what not. All they do is try to sell you the \"touristy\" packages for astronomical prices. For those of you who have been to mexico they are no different than the people that greet you at the airport and try to sell you things. I have a terrible fear of being taken advantage of and had hoped that our \"personal concierge\" would actually be of help. They were no different than the people that I spoke of. For instance we arranged with the entertainment staff to go out to Playa Del Carmen one night. Osirus was our chaperone from the hotel We went out with a group of people to Coco Bongo (fabuous by the way). The communication was terrible. We got to Playa and some people had bought tickets previously. One of the gentlemen in our group (an older guy, 50 or so) said he didnt realize that this was a loud club as opposed to a bar. He said he would like to return to the hotel. Osirus told him nope, sorry he couldnt take the free shuttle back and that he was on his own until 4am when the shuttle would return for everyone else. He brought no money with him and was just stranded. I honestly dont know what happened to him. We paid 60 dollars each to get in this place. Upon talking to a couple of women who rode into town with us I found out they paid 100 dollars each. Its this kind of lack of communication and that overwhelming sense of being taken advantage of that will prevent me from returning to this resort. Food: The first nights room service was excellent. The next evening we went to the italian restaurant. It was moderate. Every morning for breakfast we had the buffet. It was decent. Lots of fresh fruits but again nothing special. After a day or two we realized that all of the food comes from the same kitchen and to be honest by the end of our trip we couldnt stand the food anymore. None of it was outstanding. It was all just average. For $130/day or whatever the all inclusive works out to it was just not worth it. Not to mention the \"late night\" room service (after 11pm) was inedible. I wouldnt be surprised if housekeeping or the concierge made it. Of course this has nothing to do with the fact that my wife and her friend got food poisoning from the beef medallions from the grill. Food prep and sanitary practices are not top priority at all. Beach: Everyone else is right, the beach is not the clear blue water you find everywhere else in Cancun/surrounding areas. I think this might have to do with the long dock and rock jetty(?) that kind of creates a cove of sorts for the resort. I think a lot of sediment and rock gets washed up in this area. As a matter of fact I saw a hotel employee removing rocks from the beach one day for safety. It is a short walk down the beach to the next resort to experience a clear blue ocean that is swimable. This really wasnt. The \"sports bar\" is a joke. A few tvs and one bartender but it needs something. Not quite sure what but I didnt enjoy it. I feel like I have gone on long enough. I wanted to like this place. I really did. Normally I am not picky at all. I just assumed with all these 4 and 5 star reviews that I would be experiencing paradise. The grounds are immaculate. At least I can say that. If you are a young family with children under 15 or so, this may be for you. If you are a young couple or dont want to be tied down to the resort this place is not for you. A cab ride to Playa del Carmen is 200 pesos minimum and to Cancun it is closer to 500 pesos. EACH WAY! They say they have free shuttle service to Playa del Carmen. What they dont tell you is that it is free at designated times no later than like 12:30pm and you have to pay to come back. If you want to venture out, do a day trip to Cozumel or go out at night you will have to pay a pretty penny. One last thing, this place claims to be eco-friendly and \"green\" but it is far from it. Paper towels everywhere (as opposed to hand dryers). They ask you to hang your towels if you dont want them to be switched out so we did that. They still gave us new ones. We are from Seattle. I mean we know a little bit about this stuff. They didnt recycle or anything that I noticed. I dont know, it wasnt a big deal, just something I thought I should point out. I know this review is kind of sporadic and all over the place but you can see from my other reviews that I am not normally this negative.

I would like to mention the resort clean grounds, beautiful landscape, 90%polite employees ( liked a lot Miquel from the Oscar's team for his very fast and good services), good food, and very good showers. We had an awesome trip to Chichenitza with the very knowledgeable and friendly Orlando (he was probably the only one who indeed deserved a substantial tip!). One our way to Chichenitza, we stopped to a very unusual eating place that although was looking shabby, was clean and had real tomatoes and cheese, and lots of very tasty fresh vegetables so I could have a wonderful meal (they had also lots of cooked food, but that was in the resort too); there have been few kids dancing traditional dances while we had lunch and I liked their performance and costumes- that part of Mexico is very poor and it really impressed me to see those kids being so serious about their work ! Now back to the Hacienda resort, it helped me to take my dryer (thanks to the lady who wrote about this on tripadvisor!) and it would have helped me also to have some disposable paper cups because all the drinks outside the building were served in plastic cups which unfortunately were kind of dirty; few times I also noticed that the back of the plates were dirty and once I found a hair in my food ( I showed that to the person who served us without making too much fuss because I know accidents may happen but I didn't give any tip), and one day, as I was looking after a shoe in my room, I saw under a piece of furniture half of an apple that was looking kind of being there for a while, so definitely they have to be more careful with their cleaning and have disposable paper cups( that are recyclable). They should consider that the paper cups would be a better protection for everyone in case of a viral or bacterial infection in the resort (there are lots of kids!). There have been few employees that were far away from elementary politeness (doesn't want to recall those moments again to ruin my day!). In conclusion,I'll go again at Hacienda because overall I had a very good vacation, there have been employees that really made our vacation very enjoyable, I liked a lot Oscar's meals, the restaurants, the beach, the music (sometimes jazz in the afternoon), the cenotes, the river and the pools with ocean water.

Our goal was to go to Mexico for Spring Break without experiencing the Spring Breakers! :) We have 2 girls ages 10 and 13 so we were looking for something a little quieter. We did. This hotel is off the beaten path- about 15 minutes to Playa by cab, about 40 minutes to the airport. I used a transfer service from the airport to the hotel- playadelcarmentransfers.com, and it was cheaper than the $45 pp that BookIt wanted me to pay. It was $130 for an Expedition that met us at the airport and picked us up when we were ready to leave. We had Mauricio- what a great guyy! Anyway, the resort is cool but if you have been to Cancun and are expecting the same beach, it is not like that. The 3 rivers at the resort feed into the ocean here so the water is darker and at some points, stinky. Mind you, the kids still got in the water albeit cold. The red flags were up at the main beach and we did not swim there. The tours offered by the hotel were cool- we did the kayaking/snorkeling and the bike tour- we enjoyed them both. GIovanna was a sweetheart and the guy, I forget his name, well, my daughter's thought he was cute :) Service was awesome- best waiter/pool boy was Ignatio (Nacho) and we became quick friends with him.

It was fairly meager but it was free and came in very handy. I would recommend that you tell them what you would like in it if you do this. Another thing we thoroughly enjoyed were the \"beds\", yes beds they put on the beach for their guests to enjoy. There's a picture of them on the website. They had a canopy on the top. You can't imagine how nice it is to lay on the pillows, shaded from the sun, listening to the ocean crash on the shore. Take a book, take a nap, but don't miss enjoying those beds on the ocean, they were simply marvelous. Even better was the fact that occasionally a waiter would come by and ask if we'd like a drink. Would we like a drink?

We walked down 5 or so resorts and you're not just a few beaches away from something nice, although it gets nicer the farther away you get from HTR. I would recommend making it a shorter trip or taking a half-step down in hotel quality in order to stay at a hotel on a great beach.

I'll break down our experience for you: Food: We tried all of the restaurants except for the Italian. We ate breakfast at either the International Buffet or the Hacienda Grill each day. Both offered a wide variety of breakfast items. For lunch we enjoyed the Il Forno Pizzeria and the Hacienda Grill, both of which can be delivered to you poolside by one of the very attentive waiters. We ate at a different restaurant each night. On our arrival day there was a Welcoming Party outside that offered a buffet and live entertainment. Food, weather and music were all great! The second night we tried Kotori and were very pleased. The third night we tried the mexican cuisine, El Alebrije. This was the most unimpressive meal we had all week. However, after not eating much of our meal we wandered down to get some snacks from the buffet and were perfectly content. There was another party on the beach our fourth night which offered another buffet outside. The food was ok but the scenery and weather were better. We loved being able to eat outside on the beach and enjoy the warm breeze. Our last night we reserved a special lobster dinner (included in our all inclusive plan) at the Hacienda Grill. Delicous! I recommend doing this when you're there. You can choose which restaurant you want to have the dinner at except for Porto Bello, the Italian restaurant. Also, some late nights we would order room service which had a large selection and was delivered within 30-45 minutes. Service: All of the servers at the resort were timely, attentive and wanting the please the guests. We did not have any trouble getting good service. We did tip throughout the week but it didn't exceed $100. Everyone worked so hard to make sure we had everything we needed. We left very pleased. Spa: This was the only place where the service was not up to par. We had the 30 minute massages that were included in our package. Each person paid $12 that included tax and gratuity and can NOT be paid at the spa. It gets attached to your room and you pay when you check out. If you choose to pay with US Dollars you will receive change in Pesos. Unfortunately for us, our massage therapists whispered to each other throughout the entire massage. We were disappointed since you can't exactly relax when that's going on. This same experience happened to the couple we were traveling with. Cleanliness: The place was spotless. At one point we got into an elevator while the cracks of the floor were being scrubbed. Of course, if you choose to eat outside there will be flies nearby. I didn't notice it bothering me though. Also, keep in mind any food left unattended will be snached up by the birds that watch around the pool area. Room: Our room was just as the pictures looked. We had a Mangrove Junior Suite which included a jacuzzi on our balcony. We were on the corner of the building which looked over the parking lot. However, we also had a second balcony due to being on the corner. Both views were great with one overlooking the entire resort and the other looking over the forest and the ocean in the distance. The beds were so very comfortable and we were able to sleep great every night. We never received the \"pillow menu\" that the website talks about but found ourselves not needing it. The pillows on the bed were comfortable. Nature Park: We toured the nature park by bicycles one afternoon. We were shown the several cenotes on the property and also the nursery. We went on a short kayaking tour one afternoon which was enoyable. The water is crystal clear. We also took a 30 minute sailboat trip on the ocean where we could see straight to the bottom the whole time. The resort also offers snorkeling. We would recommend the resort to any families or singles that don't mind being around children. There is an adult only pool that is much quieter than the other pools.", "Date": "March 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Monroe, New York", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful place, friendly staff.\u201d", "Author": "bnd1", "ReviewID": "UR101735936", "Content": "Wonderful place.

At italian restaurant Gabriel with his flambe (fires up alcohol and pour it on cake) was a treat to see. The food was just great at the site.

When I booked through the representative from Sunset, he told me that this place would \"blow me away\", as he classed it as a 5 star resort. So of course, I went in with extremely high expectations, which may have been part of the problem, because I was hugely \"underwhelmed\" by the experience. First, for those wondering about the time share presentation, it did take about 3 hours, but by making it clear at the beginning, that we were not going to purchase anything, and that we had a really bad experience in the past, with over pushy sales people; I would say the whole ordeal was not that bad. As for the resort, there was nothing \"grab you\" about the place. The entrance, the foyer, the restaurants, were all very average in appearance. Nothing left us with the \"wow\" factor. The pools were nothing special at all. As for the main beach, it was sandy, and it did have the \"King Size Beds\", which I suppose was a nice touch . But the swimming was not great, as there was all this \"red debris we learned is a result of the mangroves, which the kids when they went into swim, they had it all over them. It went inside their bathing suits, and was a pain to clean off. However, there was a beach, which they don't talk about, and we stumbled across which was very clean. You had to go to the far side of the resort, and cross a small river flowing into the ocean. It was quite isolated, which actually made it quite nice. Yes, I am mentioning a good thing here. My kids acted as though we were on a deserted island. That's how private it was. We were the only people on that beach. Other really good features of the resort would be the 3 rivers, which do flow into the ocean, as well as the 10 Cenotes that are there. The kids had fun in the river where it met the ocean, as you could float and let the current carry you. This was big fun for them. Yes, another positive and new experience. As for the Cenotes, only one was where you could swim. This was also a lot of fun, and a unique experience for us all. This is a big positive for the resort. However, what was disappointing, we were told that there were some very unique caves to see, as well as other Cenotes, which were not actively available to guests, as they were not completed yet??? Of interest, I took my family on a hike in the trails and visited the other Cenotes. Only one other had the clean pristine water for swimming. The others were somewhat darker, and you couldn't see in the water. My kids wanted to go swimming, but I didn't think it was a good idea. And probably a good thought, as at our last dinner, we met with a guest who was a timeshare member, and last year he and his son went for a swim in the second Cenote, and were going to make their way all the way down the river to the ocean. They were on their way, when they looked up, and there was a 7 foot crocodile on the shore of the river. Both the son and father told this story, so I believe it to be true. (Not sure if Crocodiles are in that area, but I thought I should share this story) Okay, let's talk about our room . For the most part, our room was decent. We had the Junior Suite, which had the 2 Queen beds. The beds were fairly comfortable to sleep on. The only complaint about the room was the washroom area was right next to the door entrance to the room. So, whilst I was in the shower, which has a glass door, a maid knocked at the door, and when my wife answered, I looked out, and I could see the maid plain and clear from the shower, which meant she could see me. I hope she liked the surprise! :) So, that is an issue. As well, there is no door to the washroom area for privacy. This is a concern, as my girls are 7 and 9, and we think it not proper that they see Dad in his birthday suit. With the closet complete with glass doors, being right across from the washroom, you really couldn't help but see a person getting dressed in the washroom. May not be a big deal for some, but we felt the room needed more privacy. I'm sure my kids will survive. Okay, let's talk about our ugliest moment. We are from Toronto, Canada, and therefore we were up since 2:00am EST enroute to our holiday. We arrived at the resort at roughly noon hour, Mexican time. We did have a quick bite for lunch when we arrived. But for dinner, we thought as they \"bragged\" about their excellent room service, and in being that we were all so tired from our travels, that we would order from room service. Hence, I called room service prior to 7:00pm, and was told it would be 45 minutes for the food. It was 8:00pm, and still no food, so I called them again. I was told the food was on the way. Waited another 20 minutes, and still no food. I called again, and was told that they were having issues with their service on this night, but the food would for sure be there within 30 minutes. By this time, my first daughter had fallen to sleep. 30 minutes now passes, and I still don't have anything. And you guessed it, now daughter number 2 has fallen to sleep. Needless to say, both my wife and I were livid, as now our girls had gone to bed with nothing to eat. The food finally arrived at just before 10:00pm. It took 3 hours!!!!! We were both so upset, that we called to speak with a hotel manager, but were politely told that the manager currently on duty couldn't speak English. This experience was horrible. Of course, our girls were going to survive the experience, but this was not necessary. If I had not been told that the food was on the way, I would have just gone to the buffet, and picked up food. Anyway, that was our worst experience. Another thing that I had to complain about, but trust me, we were not the only ones, was the lack of activities during the day around the pool, and especially in the evening. You know, I am not one who enjoys resorts where it is extremely loud, and whistles blowing all the time, and where it is just none stop. But this was the complete opposite. There was very low music playing, and hardly any activities. I would score this resort very poor in this regard. As for the evening entertainment, I should call it lack of entertainment. We met several people who actually complained to management about this. And when entertainment was over, let's say around 8:30, there was absolutely nothing happening. This was not so bad for kids our girl's age, but being 7 and 9, they didn't stay up too late to begin with. But if you had older kids, like several friends we met down there, it was terrible. Pretty much everyone spent their evenings going back to their rooms watching DVD's. Can we all give a collective \"fun wow\". This is a major problem at this resort. They need someone to teach them what entertaining their guests is all about. It is really a shame. And even with the performances, there was always something lacking. The one night they had what they called a circus. The performers were decent enough, but they were lacking the flair and costumes you will find at other resorts. Actually, all of the uniforms on their staff were lacking. They didn't look as nice and professional as other resorts again we have been too. This was something I noticed as soon as we arrived. On a positive note, the food was quite good. The only complaints that I would agree with, would be that there wasn't enough variety. And it might be nice to have some cold treats somewhere in the resort. Something like ice cream, would have been nice. And they had ice cream, but you had to ask for it. I'm sure most people didn't even know that they had ice cream. Another positive thing to note here was the fact that you could ask for many items not on the menu, and they would get it for you. If you wanted a lobster dinner, they would provide one for you, as long as you gave them some notice. So, this definitely was a perk!!! Anyway, this is my own personal and honest opinion of the resort. The overall sad thing is that they do have a wondeful property, and I believe they could offer so much more, so that they don't have guests writing such negative reports on their stay.

I told them we were not interested in the time share, but we still had to go through a short dog and pony show (about five minutes) in which I again told them we were not interested. They did not press on. We were then taken to our room which was in building four and on the mangrove side. We could still see and hear the ocean from our room. The room was very nice and the bed was amazing with its feather bed topper. The resort is very laid back and since we went over spring break, we couldn't tell it was spring break! This may not be good for people wanting a more party atmosphere, but we loved it! Very relaxing. The beach is not all that pretty, but we spend most of our time around pools when we vacation, so that was not an issue. As for the food-outstanding! The drinks-sub par.

We were disgusted and concerned. We did not know how they got there, and thought that perhaps someone had been in our room. I immediately called the front desk to inform them of the situation and they sent someone to the room. Ten minutes later, still no one had arrived. I then received a phone call from the operator informing me that I needed to take the \"privacy please\" sign off the door knob so that the concierge could knock. Really?!?! I called you to tell you there is a problem, and you came all the way to the room, saw the sign, and turned around and went back to the desk? That is incredibly ridiculous and embarrassing to your service. Finally, the gentlemen came in, \"surveyed the situation\" and removed the item and apologized. We went to bed, angry, and disgusted. We checked out the following morning, and upon receiving our bill I inquired about what would be done to resolve the issue and what type of compensation the hotel would offer from this glaring problem. The front desk staff looked through the concierge log book from the evening before, and found no indication of the incident. Therefore, there is no proof (beyond my word) that it ever happened. I fought this for a short time, and was asked to fill out a comment card. I did this, and told them that I would never recommend this hotel. I was told I would be contacted about the situation after a manager could review it. Suffice to say - I have not heard from anyone over a week later. My main issue is that I was treated as though I was lying, and that I had to leap through hoops in order to get an apology or even a sniff of compensation (still nothing). Customer service is key in this industry, and you have proved that you hold no value in your customers experience. This situation could have been easily resolved. I felt disrespected and did not appreciate the resistance from your staff to rectify the situation. This will not be the final review I submit, and as a result I hope you appreciate the value of your customers input now.", "Date": "March 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oakland, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cRealistic Review!\u201d", "Author": "Safariman6262", "ReviewID": "UR99564874", "Content": "When you arrive at the airport you will be directed to purchase either a 95.00 cab ride, or pay 32.00 a piece for the shuttle. We took the shuttle. It was fairly quick, easy, and painless. Upon arrival check-in was interesting. We were told the room was ready, then told to sit in the lobby and wait for the key. Well after an hour of sitting I addressed the situation. Here the entire time we were waiting for someone from the hotel 'time share' staff to come and talk to us. Soon as I figured that out I demanded a key, told them no time share for me, and off we went. The grounds of the resort are pretty nice. All the staff was super friendly. They were always working to clean up or keep things looking nice. Rooms were pretty nice. Bedding, feather bed, was to die for. I especially enjoyed the balcony. TV was decent. AC worked very well. Shower and bath area was very nice. There is a hair dryer and safe in the room. One nice feature is there is FREE wireless internet everywhere. My girlfriend tried doing homework and uploading it, that didn't work well, but simple surfing of the net for emails worked well. Food, well, my experiences with most time shares is that food isn't so great. This was much the same. The breakfast buffet was ok, all other buffet meals were terrible. The Italian restaurant was ok, Asian restaurant was better, the grill out by the pool was pretty fair, pizza place was ok. Sports bar was a total joke. The pools are pretty nice. I liked the layout of the pools. There were lots of spots to relax in the pool away from others. Plenty of lounge chairs, drink service at the pool was good also. Please note there is NO swim up bar. The water at the beach, well, trust me, you'll never get in it. It is NASTY!!! Very dirty, ocean floor is spongy. When I tried walking through this area my feet sank in to above my ankles. We took a 15.00 cab ride to Playa del Carmen. It was a 22.00 cab ride to Xcaret. Would I stay here again, uh, no. There are too many other places out there I'd rather try.

The food is terribly disappointed, ocean front water area is terrible, I'd like to have a swim-up bar. I purchased my trip through a bid for site, so I paid only 90.00 per person per night.

As soon as we walked in the issues began. Although I had booked an Ocean View room months earlier, they did not have any available and did not want to tell me so. The room was booked as part of the wedding and all of the guests paid the higher rate for the ocean view, not the Mangrove. Turns out they are one in the same. all of the rooms in the hotel face inward and the hotel is shaped like a U. So only the rooms at the very end get a decent ocean view. For me to see the ocean i had to stick my head out of the balcony and turn it 90 degrees right. I go on many vacations to resorts or beachfront ans am very disappointed. The front desk staff was uncourteous. When i asked to speak with a manager, conveniently every manager was so tied up in a meeting that they couldn't break away to speak with a guest. So much for service. I have been managing restaurants for about a decade and have never been in such an important meeting that a customer had too wait. 30 minutes later and two managers appeared and said that they ha no other rooms which were ocean view. Their solution... get me a cab to take to a different hotel to stay there. How convenient considering I was staying there for a wedding which had about 30 rooms booked, with at least two persons per room. Also, many of the other guest didn't have any view at all nor were our rooms located in a centralized location. This may seem like silly complaining but I have been in the service industry long enough to know bad service when I see it. Our discounted rate shaved about $20 from regular nightly fare, nothing to write home about. I could have booked the Mangrove room directly from there website and saved a significant amount of money. Without getting into too many details, let's just say that the bride and groom were also not too happy when things that the had previously spoken about were not being taken care of. For example the hotel completely changed the menu for the rehearsal dinner. This was set up (at an additional charge to them although the hotel is all inclusive) and we were served the same food that was in the buffet pretty much every other evening. And the beach, well read any other review. It sucks. Specially considering Playa de Carmen it beautiful and only about 15 minutes away. P.S.

Everyone was fantastic. Housekeeping personnel will greet you as you pass them in hallways, restaurant staff are courteous, and other staff are willing to lend a helping hand whenever they can (even if it meant stopping what they were doing to show you the gym after-hours, simply because you asked where the gym was). - Free Wi-Fi in buildings and by pools. The speed was at times not great, but it was always sufficient. - Not too busy. We visited in February. It was rare to wait at a restaurant. It was easy to find a good spot by the pool or the beach. - Nice sandy beach (but see below for water/swimming in sea). - Nice pools. - Leave housekeeping a tip and get a surprise. Try it. ;-) - For inexpensive trips to/from Cancun and Play del Carmen use the Collectivo (i.e. public transit). Their vans are super-clean and air conditioned. The trip to Playa costs 20 pesos per person. The trip to Cancun costs 35 pesos per person (although you will have to take the bus if you want to go to the hotel district). From Playa, you can also take the Collectivo to Tulum and see the ruins there. We found it very easy to move around between towns on the freeway. WHAT'S NOT SO GOOD: - The beach is short and the water dirty. Not the best place for swimming. - Rooms are not soundproofed. You can easily hear people in the hallways. - Because it's still a small resort, there are few restaurants on site. The master project as was explained to us will include major expansions in the future, but until then, there are few places to eat.

This is a gorgeous resort set back off the highway and right on the beach..Large, beautiful, comfortable (especially the beds), clean rooms. Well landscaped and maintained grounds. Two very large and lovely pools. Friendly personnel. Great weather (but the hotel didn't have anything to do with that-just luck of draw). We arrived on a Thursday, and because of the warnings, were ready for the sales pitch. That was quick and painless since we knew what to expect. The rest of the stay we were not bothered about taking the tour. Though we arrived several hours early, our room was ready. I was surprised at how big it was and from the second floor had a pretty decent view. We were able to try out most of the restaurants while there even though I was confined to our room a couple of days due to a \"gift\" I believe I received from our grandchildren before we left the States, and not due to the food. Our traveling companions said the Mexican Restaurant was not good and they did not want to go back. From that observation, I believe the Hacienda grill has the best food. Wish we had more time to sample the menu. The resort went to a lot of trouble to set up, on two different evenings, a buffet outdoors complete with linen covered tables, chairs and china place settings. The beach left a little to be desired though the hotel staff was continually trying to keep it clean of debris. The water was not the clear blue you would expect so we didn't venture in at that location..Further down the beach it is much better. We stayed at the \"adults only\" pool the whole week. My complaint about the pool area is that the three hot tubs are at the \"non\" adults only pool and the kids monopolized them. It would have been nice to have at least one hot tub for just adults. There are several tours you can take on the property (all free). I would encourage anyone who goes to Hacienda Tres Rios to take at least one of them. They are short. The kayak/snorkel/swim tour was enjoyable and not strenuous. There were a couple small things that could have been improved. The TV in our room had very poor sound and on one of the channels (which happened to be the one we were most interested in) about one fourth of the screen was cut off. We never mentioned it to the front desk so I don't know how quickly (of if) it would have been resolved. The room attendant didn't always restock needed items. Room service was usually a 35-45 minute wait and the food didn't always arrive hot. Be sure to get your free massage. The $12 tax is worth it.

Be aware that the snorkeling equipment is only provided when you take the free formal tours so if you want to do it on your own, bring your equipment. There are about 270 acres and lots of lounges, seats and beach beds so there are always choices available. One down side is that there aren't enough bathrooms, especially by the beach.

I was with my husband and people I work with, the trip was paid for by my company so I can't attest to the \"value\" because I don't know what it actually cost. As an all-inclusive, we did not have to wear wrist bands, other packages did. We were not approached by a time share person at all. Our trip was booked through Apple Vacations and I've been to resorts where Apple reps were always onsite. This is not the case here, the Apple rep only comes once a day early in the morning. We weren't planning to do any excursions, so that didn't bother us. The room was very clean. We did end up in a room with two queen beds, no jacuzzi, but we survived. I was skeptical that one bed might have or had at one time bed bugs, so we slept in the other bed. (I inspected every inch of both beds/mattresses) We did not have any bed bug bites. There really isn't an \"ocean view\" room because the hotel is set far back from the beach. Other reviews of the beach are spot on. The Gulf waters were brown and murky but the little river sections were as clear as can be. There were beds and lounge chairs on the beach and it seemed very peaceful. We spent most of our time at the \"adult\" pool which is by one of the outdoor restaurants. We always had service for drinks, the water was clear and it was very peaceful. This is not a party place. There is no swim up bar, or party music and entertainers. It was truly a place to relax and enjoy the sun. Food: I would describe the food as \"eclectic/fusion\". If you are expecting tacos or fajitas at the Mexican restaurant or chicken parm at the Italian restaurant, think again. I enjoyed trying other foods, but my husband was a bit more picky. He's a meat and potatoes man and he ended up eating a lot of potatoes. The Italian and Japanese restaurants were fantastic. The Mexican restaurant, not so much. The buffet at lunch was average, breakfast was good. The breakfast offered an omlette station and a quesadilla station. I wished they had the quesadilla station at lunch...they were very yummy. The beach \"carribean\" buffet on Wed. night was not good. We ordered room service pizza that night and it was very good.

We decided to use one of our timeshare weeks there and are glad we did. We had spent the week before in Akumal, so we arrived at HTR around noon. Our room wasn't ready (check-in isn't until 3:00), so we wandered, had lunch, and went to the pool. We were told the room would be ready in about 30 minutes, but we were told that several times. Eventually (after checking and checking and checking) our room was ready around 3:00. It would be good if they could come up with a system to notify you when your room is ready so you don't have to keep going to the desk and asking. Maybe a pager system? The hotel grounds are gorgeous with beautiful landscaping and a large pool area that feels smaller than it is because of the wandering shape of the pools. We spent our week lounging by the adult pool, so I can't speak to the activity staff at the busier pool. But it was lovely to walk out to the pool in the mornings and have the chairs ready with towels waiting and smiling faces at the grill restaurant for breakfast. We ate breakfast there and at the buffet and both were fine--lots of good food. We had lunch there every day--the shrimp was great, and they brought us more when we asked for it. I enjoyed the chilled fruit soup, too. Both of us were glad that the gym is so well-equipped--even two bikes which can be rare in hotel gyms. The equipment was all in working order--another rarity! It was extremely busy in the mornings. We took the bike tour one morning to see the eco-park. It would have been nice to be able to check out a bike to ride on our own, but I'm guessing insurance liability prevents that. The park is impressive--but we had fun seeing a coati around the pool. That was all the wildlife we saw during the week. Our room was gorgeous with a view out across the property to the ocean. It was immaculate. We had to ask for foam pillows since we have an allergy to feathers. They showed up quickly, but somehow disappeared our last night. The walk-in shower was big enough for two which is always fun! It was nice to get up in the morning and sit on the balcony and watch the resort \"wake up\". Food--it was great! We enjoyed the Italian, Asian and Mexican restaurants at night. Didn't try the pool grill at night but heard they do terrific rib-eye steaks, so maybe on our next trip there we'll try that. We asked for extra sushi at the Asian restaurant and were given all we wanted. It was nice not to have to make a reservation. My husband had closed-toed dress Merrell sandals but had to go put on his gym shoes to eat in the Asian and Italian restaurants. He did, but it seemed a bit silly to see the women in flip-flops. Maybe they can rethink that part of the dress code? Drinks were very good with top-shelf liquor openly available. At other AI resorts we have had to ask for top-shelf liquor since it is often hidden from view. We were there for Super Bowl Sunday. The staff worked hard to put on a Super Bowl party in the Sports Bar. They set up lots of chairs and tables and provided plates of appetizer/snack foods. I imagine room service was busy after the game! The highlight was the Chef's Table. We had reserved before we arrived at the HTR. Chef Oscar cooked and served our seven course dinner, and it was possibly the best meal I've had any where. He is a gem. When you purchase the AI for the week you receive a free 30 minute massage. We upped it to an hour, and wound up have two hour-long massages during the week. The spa was well-managed and the massages were excellent. I'd recommend it.

The grounds, the service, the pools, the beach, the rooms, you could not ask for anything more. There are all these walk ways and bridges that lead you to hide away places to just relax on a lounge chair or a hammock or just walk around towards the beach. Very easy to find your way around. The HRT was full the week we were there and you would have never known it. There is always a place to sit at the pools. There are also beach beds, but there are people that go down early in the morning and put there towels and books there to save there special bed. They do ask you not to do it, but some people just don't care. But, by the afternoon, we always found a few empty ones. They do need more umbrellas at the pools, but that was not a deal breaker. As for the restaurants, this is one of our complaints. The service was great, everyone was willing to help you. But the problem was in the speciality restaurants. The buffet was great, as so the Mexican and Italian, and the food was good, but it was fancy. If you are picky, you might not like all the choices. But as we found out, they will make you something that is not on the menu, so that is were the great service comes in, they are so willing to please you. One more thing, Ladies take your own hair dryer. The ones in the rooms are the worst. They do have regular ones, that you can ask for, but I don't know how many they have, so bring your own. As for entertainment at night, it is quiet. They have a Mexican and a beach party night, where they have a band, and yes it is nice and you can dance and enjoy your self, but other than that it is quite there. There is a sports bar, where after 10:00 it gets lively, but that is it. And yes they do have a gambling night on Thursday night, which is fun. But if you like the sun and just want to lay back this is the place to go. Also sign up for the bike, and kayak tour. You are on the bike for 5 minutes and then you kayak for 2 hours, then you can also snorkle. The kayak ride is beautiful, and very relaxing. Over all I would go back. The people really try to make it a very nice vacation for you and your family. And no you don't have to take the timeshare tour. We got in and had to wait for our room for 10 minutes and they wanted us to talk to someone, but we said no thank you and that was it, no pressure.

The food is always up to par and Oscar the Chef comes up w new ideas for us everytime we visit! We had a special anniversary dinner on the Terrace of our condo it was a breath taking experience overlooking the Carribean lights of the Cozumel coastline and our lighted resort! Sammy & Miguel!! We cannot express enough about their consistent quality of service they provide our family. We belong to the Yacht club and take a trip on every visit , Sammy & Miguel put a Lunch together along w beverages both alcohol & non for our day on the Yacht. We travel to Isla Mujeres, dock off shore about 100 yards and swim to the white sandy beach for a cold drink and relax in the beautiful sun.We just love the different shades of Blue water and how crystal clear it is to an all white sand bottom! Our girls love to go and hate to leave! A typical day for us starts at sitting on our balcony watching the sunrise w a coffee & fruit tray , we then head to the gym for an hour. Then it is time for breakfast as usual! From there it is to the Poolside where we have our comfortable lounge chairs . Reading , swimming, cocktails , walk on the beach, or a swim at the Cenote is always fun. Come 4 pm we finish off the day on the quiet terrace of our condo for a jacuzzi, cocktail & snack.

This resort by far is our best trip. We stayed at other 5 star all inclusives including Royal Hideaway and my husband and myself both agree with had the best time at HTR. Not that we did not enjoy the others. We never lost power and always had hot water. Pros: I want to point out that I disagree on others posts that the employees of HTR are not friendly. I NEVER once met and employee from and part of the resort who did not have a great smile and a Hola everytime we met. Check in was a breeze with Ricardo. He is such a friendly, ready to please employee. Our bell hop was prompt with our bags and explained things about the room. All of the servers in all of the restaurants were great and knowledgeable about the menus. We NEVER had to wait to be seated. We especially loved the Mexican Restaurant. The employees go out of their way to please the guests. We loved our servers especially the ones that we had everyday - Ignacio, Imelda, and Ramon. They quickly got to know our likes and were there almost without asking. They (and all the other HTR employees) are truly an asset to the hotel. Chef Oscar was everywhere! He was hands on and making sure everyone was happy. He even moved our umbrella so that it was shading my husband. There is no way you will not be able to find food to your liking. They have everything you can think of. If you don't see it ask more than likely they will be able to make it for you. My husbands favorite lunch was grilled shrimp with garlic butter at the Grill. Also, the beef medallions are fantastic at the grill for lunch (or dinner). My husband tried the cricket empanadas and said they were good. I am not that adventurous. Rooms are very large and comfortable beds. The shower is huge. Great oceanview. The grounds are beautiful! They are ALWAYS working on keeping the resort in spic and span shape. There is a running/walking trail that goes through the jungle and past the nursery. My husband and I would walk the length of it each morning before breakfast. it was beautiful walking the trail so peaceful. The cenotes and rivers are beautiful take a ride kayak down the river it is a great experience. The resorts bathrooms, public areas, restaurants, lobby area are kept in immaculate condition. The area around the pool and beach are always kept clean. The servers pick up the dishes, cups, etc. so that the area is never messy. The guest rooms are cleaned better than any hotel I have ever stayed in anywhere in the world. They pull out the dressers and clean behind them everyday. Bathrooms sparkle! Don't forget to say hello to \"Poncho\" the resorts friendly Coati. I love that this is truly an \"Eco\" friendly resort. This resort is a little bit of heaven on earth. Cons: The door latch's on the public restroom doors. They are very small and I have trouble turning the latch since I have arthritis in my fingers. But that does not distract from the hotel at all. I don't know of any other resort that we stayed in throughout the US, Mexico, caribbean and some of Europe that I could honestly say I only had such a small complaint. Wait Anguilla and the Cuisinart and Cap Juluca resorts were also top on my list. But they are not all inclusive and should not be compared. Also, we were married on Anguilla and have a passion for the Island.

If we wanted that, we would have sought them out. We call these people and those that show the time share, \"Land Sharks!\" Beware the land sharks!! Our \"concierge\" even told us that we couldn't even take the free shuttle to downtown Playa unless we signed up for the presentation! This is a beautiful resort! Rooms are amazing! Grounds are wonderfully kept. If you want constant service you will need to hang out by the pool. Down at the beach you will see staff at 10 a.m. but then they concentrate up by the pool area and infrequently by the beach. We even would give a tip and service was still spotty at best...we were down by the beach every day. Considering other all-inclusives we've stayed at, this one lacked in the number of people taking beverage and food orders around the pool and beach and this hotel was far from capacity the week we stayed. The rooms are amazing and well kept. Everyday they were cleaned. Sometimes lotion or shampoo wasn't replenished or bath mats were taken and not replaced, but overall, they did a wonderful job. \"Turn down\" services happened infrequently, with a knock at the door one night past 9 o'clock. For the cost of the All Inclusive, you do get some wonderful opportunities on the resort. Be sure to take advantage of them. Swimming in the cenote is refreshing. DO NOT MISS taking the bike or kayak trip with Cori! She is adorable! She has a constant smile and a true desire to interact with her guests! Israel out by the sail boats will give you a wonderful ride! He is also one of those employees with a constant smile and a genuine interest in you as a guest. Food: this seems to be quite the topic for discussion at this resort. We Chicagoans love our pizza and quality restaurants! After having visited a true culinary resort last year that was also All-Inclusive, for the money, we were disappointed in the food at Hacienda Tres Rios. Nothing horrible, but not at a level we expected...again, because of the overall cost of the All-Inclusive. Some of the best meals we ate (breakfast, lunch or dinner) were had at the Hacienda Grill and the brick oven pizza. You also will be entertained at the Brick oven pizza by the coatis! They love pizza! One huge word or warning: We have been to many resorts and read that proper attire is expected in the restaurants. At this one, the information sheet suggested men to wear closed toed shoes. MEN: BE AWARE you will be denied access to some of the restaurants no matter how nicely you are dressed if you aren't wearing close toed shoes! Not just nice dress sandals, but CLOSE TOED SHOES. Crazy...We saw people dressed in sloppy clothing but because they had \"the right shoes\" they were allowed in. You can always eat at the buffet or Hacienda or the Brick oven pizza restaurants dressed just about anyway you like! We are beach, not pool, people. The beds down by the beach are wonderful. Even though the hotel says not to reserve them, people get up at 6:30 to lay their towels and books out on the beds right in front of the hotel. There are more beds on the other side of the small river, but we never saw service offered over there, hence the rush to get these beds early in the morning. And, \"yes\" the beach isn't quite the beautiful blue Caribbean waters you may think. But then again, you are at a beach where 3 rivers spill into the ocean! It is still a great beach! Again, this is an amazing place. There is a lot to see and do at this beautiful resort, but we felt the All-Inclusive fees were too high especially when the quality of the food didn't meet the expectations for the money paid.

Easy Access to all facilities. Room service is great. My favorite item on the menu: beef skirt sandwich on a baquette. Free Wi-fi. What's bad: Not enough staff. Be prepared to wait in line for everything. From checking in, getting served in a restaurant, to getting drinks at a bar. Also, very few bars - no stools by the bars. Not enough public restrooms. Kids club is a plastic table next to the kiddie pool. Overall, I was really annoyed at how long it takes to get any kind of service in this place. There are a bunch of timeshare salespeople hanging out in the lobby doing nothing- while there is a line 20 people deep at the concierge desk. I wont be coming back to this place.

First, what everyone says about the service is true! The staff aims to please and please they do! We were always asked if we needed anything, drinks were brought to us frequently, often without asking. Guac/salsa at the pool is the BEST. Add a pizza and it was lunch every day! The beds are soft and cozy, the rooms are large, there are activities for the adventurous and good times are had by all! In a nutshell \u2013 excellent! As with any vacation, there are minor annoyances, but hey, you\u2019re on vacation\u2026.why let those little things ruin an otherwise great time?! Where to begin with the detail?? How about the beginning? Check-in was a little trying. We arrived just before 3pm, so I thought we\u2019d be ok. We were greeted at the front door by a waiter asking if we wanted anything\u2026.he prompted brought us tasty margaritas! The front desk said our rooms (3) weren\u2019t ready yet, so we opted to visit the buffet for some much needed food. I\u2019d guess we ate for around an hour and by then only one of our three rooms was ready. It took another 2 hours for the others to become available. They may have been available sooner, but we waited in the lobby and no one came to get us so we only knew they were ready because we finally asked. Annoying \u2013 yes, did it ruin my vacation, absolutely not! Check-out was very simple and they front desk was otherwise very helpful. I chalked it up to a Saturday check-in. We were never once approached by the timeshare folk, guess we musta looked poor! Our rooms were just as in the pictures. Very spacious and the beds are fluffy and comfortable. The pillows were fine with us, so we didn\u2019t even try the pillow menu (didn\u2019t even look for it). The information center never worked for any of us, so I can\u2019t comment on it. Our bellboy said it rarely works, so I\u2019m not really sure why it\u2019s there. Frig in the room is stocked with water, sodas and beer, which was fine for us. We did have a slight leak from somewhere (possibly the air conditioner) but we just put a towel on the floor and went on. The rooms are very nice! Overall, I\u2019d say that the food is good. We\u2019re not gourmet folk, but we don\u2019t want low end either. I thought the food was tasty and well presented. The portions are smaller than in the US, but this is by design. They try to reduce wasted food, so start with small portions and if you want more, they bring you more! We liked the Mexican restaurant best; the others were good too, but when in Rome\u2026\u2026 Breakfast at the buffet offers something for everyone. The omelet station also has breakfast quesadillas which are yummy. I took some things off the buffet to add to my omelet and they more than obliged! Lunch was always guac/salsa and a pizza pool-side. That is my definition of Heaven! The only comment that I\u2019ll make is that the website says that reservations are required for dinner at some places. This is NOT the case! We tried to make reservations with the concierge and were told none were necessary. Since we were a party of 6, we usually had a wait of around 30 minutes, but we sat under the stars and relaxed; hey, I\u2019m on vacation! We did discover that around 8 was a good time for us to eat. I will make a quick comment here about food. What they do, they do well; but try not to deviate from the menus \u2013 that throws them a bit. You can\u2019t order HGrill French Fries off room service; you get Caribbean Fries instead and each bartender makes the same drink differently, don\u2019t try to order a drink they\u2019ve never heard of, you never know what you\u2019ll get! The activities are fun. Definitely do the tours that they offer. We did the Jaguar tour and enjoyed it immensely! The Senses Tour is a MUST \u2013 a very spiritual experience. Go into it with an open mind and enjoy! The guy that leads the tour is great! We did a \u2018quickie\u2019 hobie trip. You DO need reservations for that (which we didn\u2019t know, but could have guessed). The Sunday Welcome party and the Wednesday buffet on the beach were fun. Music and food under the stars \u2013 I must be dreaming! I am not a gambler, but the casino night was fun. They give you resort cash to gamble with and an auction at the end. It was good fun. I will say that I was really looking forward to the Fire Show and the Mayan Show, but both have been replaced!! Not sure why, but I was bummed about that! The pools were beautiful \u2013 but chilly! Not sure how they can be hit all day by the sun and still be ice cold, but the beach water was warmer than the pools! There is a separate adult\u2019s pool and a family pool. The biggest problem was that all three hot tubs were in the family area, so they were overrun by kids most of the time; we were able to enjoy them later in the evening tho, but by then the beach bar was closed! A hot tub in the adult\u2019s area would have been nice. As with any resort, there are some areas of improvement. Somewhere I read a review saying that it was pretty beat up for only being 2 years old. I did notice a lot of structural cracks and broken floor tiles. Not sure if this was due to poor/quick building or because it is built on a marshy foundation. It didn\u2019t ruin my vacation, but it was something I noticed. The flipside was the vegetation \u2013 which was spectacular! Lots of quiet places where you could be alone if you wanted to. All in all, I\u2019d say it was a wonderful week, enough to do to keep you from being bored, but quiet enough to make sure you are totally relaxed.

Do not go to this resort if you are looking for culinary delights--it is about Perkins quality at best. I am so disappointed, that this is the first time I have ever taken steps to review a facility. We arrived late Sat night and had a full 15 hours of traveling behind us. Instead of being given our room keys, we were told to sit and wait for the concierge. The concierge turned out to be nothing more than a time share sell and a little info that they could (but don't) provide in a map. BTW- we paid full price, all-inclusive for this...no discount for the timeshare pitch deals. We finally said \"Enough\" and requested keys to our room. By the time we got unpacked and settled, there were not many dinner options. We requested a menu at the restaurant and were told buffet only. After eating an awful meal, we learned there were menus available but the server wanted us in his buffet section. The Asian fusion restaurant was OK, but not any better than the sushi we can get here in Wisconsin. We were treated rudely at the Mexican Restaurant. The Grill by the pool had by far the best food and the best service. The buffet was awful. They \"French bakery and coffee\" was nescafe with some frozen pastries heated up. Not kidding. If you aren't all inclusive, expect to pay a ridiculous amount of money for the food. We had to order breakfast room service one morning because we were leaving for a tour early before the restaurants opened. We ordered an $80 (US) breakfast, and were served 2 lousy scrambled eggs, refried beans, toast, coffee, and juice. It was ridiculous. The facility itself is beautiful, but to make it clear- it is set back into the mangroves. We loved the eco-friendly culture. We were very disappointed with some of the staff and the lousy food--2 or 3 star quality food. 4 star building.", "Date": "February 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxford, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFABULOUS HOLIDAY!

The short story is that this is an outstanding resort; clean, great food, amazing service and a great location. I put 'normal' in my title since after reading many reviews and then going to the resort, I wonder about some of the complaints -- my trip isn't ruined if there isn't a moist towel at check-in...or if they had a line of 2 people a head of me at the front desk. And yes, the resort is in the middle of a jungle -- ALL of them our there are in the jungle - that's the point of the 'eco park' theme! The key question is this the right type of resort for you -- they are not a lout-music-party-all night type of place. They do have fun events and live music, but not over the top type stuff that you see down-town cancun. There were a kids, but not crawling with them (but had a nice kids club). Great tours to swim in the cenotes and down the rivers, biking, etc. In short, better for folks not looking for the party scene. The big thing is service -- if you want it, they will get it for you. Resturant is closed? The waiter will find one that is open to get what you want. Need a bottle of water for a trip but none at the bar? They run to find a cold one for you. I've been all over and not found service to compare with this place (thanks to Claudia at the grill - great, great service!). Food is very good, and they will customize to your liking...don't want breaded shrimp that is on the menu? They will grill it for you...want extra shrimp? Just ask. Every employee had a smile and an a hello - far friendlier than some of the guests! We met some great people, but noticed more than a few with pretty bad manners - I suspect they are the source of some of the reviews that I read. The resort is in the jungle and you get to see coatimundi, racoons and the like crusing around the resort. They are really an eco-resort; I noticed the staff carefully separating trash and they compose the uneaten food as well. The tours from Memory Makers(?) were lots of fun, esp enjoyed the SenseAdventure tour -- they blindfold you and provide interesting experiences - definitely a must-do.

This was our second time to HTR-we were there March 2010 as well. With some 1-200 resorts in the area and our goal to try them all, we were so impressed last March that we decided to try this one for a second time. As before we were put in a very nice ocean view room with a private jacuzzi on our balcony. Again we passed on the sales presentation-the \"sharks\" were hard at it and most people told us the 90 minute presentation was more like 2-4 hours. Some had to get angry with the sales people just to end the sales show. While a lovely resort, we noticed some flaws (for a place barely 2 yrs old) The concrete around the pools and restaurants is showing some major cracking and heaving. The buildings also had many stress cracks. The was shocking to me and I can only fear what the long term effect could be. The place is built on a swamp so perhaps this will be a continuing problem. Also the adult pool is 3 ft deep. There are no hot tubs, no bar and no premium loungers at it. The family pool on the other hand is 4-5 feet deep, has 3 hot tubs, a bar and all the nicer padded loung chairs. Only resort I have ever been to in Mexico with no swim-up bar. Still no night life and while the resort was 50% full most nights by midnight there were only a handful of people out and about. The service and staff are amazing. Teo the bartender in the Mex restaurant is great. Gregory in the breakfast buffet and then working at the pool bar is great as well. You really could not ask for better. That being said, because the beach area is so dirty because of the outflow from the rivers, it is not good for those who want to swim or enjoy the ocean. Food quality was fine and you could have lobster every night if you wanted at no extra cost. Most of us agreed it is a very nice place but not likely to return. If you want a very quiet time with good food and a nice modern room, this place may be for you. However avoid the sales people at all costs. They may spoil your vacation.

The wait staff who provided beach service was so nice and attended to our every need. We further indulged ourselves at their spa which was tranquil and beautiful and the massages were exceptional ! The drinks were great at all the bars, particularly at the beach bar.

I guess you could say that the beach was somewhat of a minor drawback as there was a murkiness (staff worked hard cleaning it daily)close to the shore due to storms, however if you walked further down, it was much better. I also enjoyed dipping in the crystal clear, cool cenotes. One of the staff took us out on a catamaran and the water just a little further out was a clear aqua blue.

Re desserts, that if you had a great dessert one night and then tried it again another nite, it didn't taste the same. The staff were super accommodating but on the entertainment side, it was very disappointing- one show was just amateurish to the point of embarrassing and the others were OK. The casino nite was ridiculous with its 4 tables. We also found the walls in the rooms to be paper thin- and the lack of daytime activities a real detriment.

I found it very refreshing that the staff would not only bring you drinks to your chair, but also meals from hotel restaurants.

WITH A FEW THINGS....\u201d", "Author": "travelthetruth", "ReviewID": "UR91914579", "Content": "Let me start with saying were still staying at the hotel as I write this review. We've been in the Riviera Maya for a couple of weeks now, our last week here. We've been coming to this area for years. Our first introduction to this hotel was through a timeshare we attended. We, as some stated otherwise in their reviews, we did not find the timeshare to be too pressured... and we've been to a few...but it was not 90 min as stated, about 5hrs. I'll break the resort down with the positive first then move on to the negatives. Hotel overall appearance: Clean & Neat Rooms: Spacious rooms and comfortable soft beds. Beach Beds: Lots available and comfortable. Pizza Oven: Good Pizza Sorry that's about it.... Activities: Little to none....very quiet..great if you like to go to bed at 8:00pm. Service: Has been very, very dissapointing...lack of, as other reviews state...feels like your on your own for everything...were not high maintenance by any means but we've been to probably 50 resorts over the years in the Riviera Maya and this by far the worst for service base...sorry but true...if you like to be pampered or even thought of it won't happen here, has an isolated, no one around feeling... Staff Friendliness: Some staff say hi others pass you and clearly don't want to talk, period....no problem...but it does leave you with thinking about the negatives of this resort.....\"don't ask me\" feeling...so sad really... Food: By far the worst even out of the 3 stars we've visited...no variety, very poor setup for buffet service. Management better step up if this hotel is to survive it's critics and listen to what the reviews are telling you...the food is terrible...what little you have is wierd stuff...keep it simple and variety..this might make up for the lack of beach that clearly everyone is in agreeance on... All Inclusive: Well like other reviews, outrageous all inclusive price...they need to re-adjust this due to the terrible food offered....makes sense....again they need something to make up for that lack of beach...you'd think they'd compensate for this by offering something reasonable so you wouldn't really care to nit pick so much...but when all the negatives add up, it's not good, period... Beach: The sand is fine, the water is horrible...my niece got a rash and she just quickly went in and out, bad smell...ya, ya there's not much you can do with nature but you know what there is something your resort should offer to make up for it, lower your all inclusive plan and bring in better food, then maybe people can overlook the fact that you cant swim at your resort, no one swam in the ocean here, we've been here 6 dys...we haven't thats for sure... Small touches: Not that this is critical so much, but in every resort we've ever stayed in our little daughter loves the towel surprises the maids do when we come back to the room...every day she looked and hoped for some little made up surprise etc...nothing not 1 day...it's the small touches that this hotel lacks.... Overall we have been let down....again were not hard to please and go out of our way to find the positives...but really they're overpriced, the swamp part of the water sucks..Food is not that great and they lack organization all over...I think this is an outlet for timeshares and that's about it...Please get it together and save your resort....listen to your reviews instead of masking your return remarks...you need to compensate for what it lacks...this could be, even with the black water, a great resort.....GET ORGANIZED!", "Date": "January 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cOverrated and overpriced\u201d", "Author": "AZ_RN_2011", "ReviewID": "UR91912169", "Content": "Our first time in Cancun, stayed here with spouse, teenager and elderly aunt Christmas week 2010. The \"all-inclusive\" is a rip-off; food choices are limited (especially the buffet breakfast-UGH) and the \"beach\" is muddy and horrible for swimming. Everything related to this place is WAY overpriced (hotel-sponsored tours, car rentals, etc.). The resort does not have snorkel equipment or bikes you can use unless you go on their \"tours.\" The rooms were modern, clean, spacious and nicely furnished. But it took 20 minutes for the water to heat up enough to take a shower (no exaggeration) and the walls are PAPER THIN! If you are a light sleeper, this resort will be your worst nightmare. Every night someone in the room above us was moving something around, scraping the floor, and I could hear every word said in the next room, and people walking down the hallway echoed loudly into our room. The swimming pools were ice cold, and the spa closed every night @ 9pm for cleaning, so forget about that relaxing late-night soak. The service was good (not outstanding); but once again, the food was surprisingly mediocre and I am by no means a food snob. I will give them thumbs up for the generous amounts of alcohol (you have to beg for the good tequila). We had one server, Gregorio, who was exceptional; quick to refill drinks and suggest food choices that were available but not on the menu (otherwise, how would you know?) He always remembered what we liked and was quick to help us. Another thing we were not aware of is this resort is very isolated, no shopping or local restaurants close by. You have to take the resort shuttle or a taxi to get anywhere, and the shuttle does not run very often. Overall, the resort itself and the grounds are beautiful, but if you like spending time on the beach (why else would you even go to Cancun?) then this is not the resort to choose. We spent our last day at the sister resort, Sunset Fishermen, in Playa Del Carmen. It was much better, steps from the beautiful white sand beach, within walking distance to shops, restaurants, etc. Too bad we only had one day at Sunset Fishermen :(", "Date": "January 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAhhhh!

We traveled with our three teen-aged children and another family. I have been in Cancun close to 20 times, on cruises and on many Caribbean islands. We do adventure vacations and relax in a resort trips as well. As far as a resort vacation goes this stay was the best we have experienced. To start the setting is some what remote but in a beautiful setting amongst mangroves and not tucked between other high rise buildings. The facility is large enough to never feel crowded but not so you need a cart to get around. The rooms were spacious and immaculate. The food was good and the menu changed enough for a week's worth of variety. The four restaurants and two outdoor grills were enough to keep me interested in the menu all week. The service was tremendous, my drink was replaced at the 1/3 full stage without asking. I hardly touched a door handle. The one feature that sticks in my mind is the staff and how attentive they were. Not to stereotype but when I go to Mexico I expect the service to be slow, to wait a long time for everything and then sometimes get something other than what I wanted. Not here, our bags were brought to our room immediately, the bell hop was well informed. Room service was incredibly quick. The wait staff was there for our every need. The concierge new us by name by day two and was able to arrange anything we needed and immediately. While on the topic of staff accolades should be given to the sports and entertainment staff. They started with volleyball at 11:00 AM daily and kept us, but mostly the teens, busy until dinner. After volleyball it was soccer(football) and they kept it open and fun to everyone. They filled in with kayak, snorkeling and bicycle tours through the mangroves and rivers. Our children felt at home like playing with old friends right from the first day. Special thanks to Mariana, Carlos and Giovanna for working night and day to keep us all entertained and for the special way they have with the teens. The wait staff we ran into the most and who we appreciate deserve recognition as well, thanks to Yanira ( las Islas), Francisco (Rest. Alebrije), and Miguel. Our concierge was Dara and she was superb. Thank you to all the support staff and people who we did not get to know better, without a combined effort our stay would not be what it was. Nothing is perfect and to be honest there are a few things I would add or change. This resort is fairly isolated so to keep guests busy I would add tennis courts and a basketball court, maybe shuffle board, boccie. The beach is nice but there are no waves, a draw back from Cancun. There are plans for a marina and that will help. The only other improvement is the way the amenities are introduced. When we arrived we were early, no problem, we were made comfortable. We were approached by our \"personal concierge\" who would tell us all about the resort and arrange everything we need. Instead of doing this while we had time, and at the start of our stay, so we could take advantage of all the activities she put it off for two days. Then what we got was a few minutes on what the resort had to offer, which now we had to squeeze into 5 days, and a long expose on what we would receive for attending a presentation about the converting to ownership in the resort. After we made the appointment our \"personal concierge\" was done with us, we couldn't find her. The \"not a time share presentation\" time share presentation took 4 hours instead of 1 1/2, was typical time share and the couple we traveled with were not given what they were told they would receive. My recommendation, grab a schedule of events from the front desk concierge and get on with the fun. If you go to the presentation get up at the 1 1/2 hour mark, they won't be close to done and you preserved your precious time.

We have been coming to this area for 10 years and originally purchased a time share in Fishermans. From the first day we bought we cannot wait to go back each year. We are now up to four weeks and would spend the entire winter there if I could get my husband to fully retire. Several years ago when Tres Rios was being built we visited the resort and were overwhelmed with the beauty of the facility. Fishermen is small, quaint and the most breath taking view of the beach I have ever seen when walking out of the lobby. However, the two resorts are very different in size and proximity to the beach but the one thing that is consistent in both is the service and kindness of the staff in both. To start with Jose Luis Castenada, the member services representative has become like a part of our family and is always there to greet us and makes certain that our every need is met. I cannot imagine the hours he puts in and words alone cannot express how grateful we are to the way he has accomodated us over the years. At Fishermens, Luis, Marcial, Miguel the Capitain, MIguel the bartender, Elisio Gerinimo the waiter , Henry of the maintenance staff and Sandy in the spa have been there consistently, and wait on you hand and foot. They all deserve a raise and alot more tips from all of us who are fortunate enough to be guests in their resort. As for Tres Rios, there are more staff but no less attentive. The list could go on forever but specifically, Samuel, Miguel (now capitain and formerly ran the Mexican restaurant), and Francisco and Trini our concierge, and Chef Oscar are the best. All of the staff worked together to accomodate our every wish including a romantic lobster dinner for 2 on Christmas Eve which was no easy feat and much appreciated by us. From the wait staff Javier, Gregorio, Francisco, Justino, Imelda, Rigoroberto in the Pizza Restaurant,and Alfredo and Pedro in the Mexican Restaurant were super. Gorge of the bell staff is wonderful as well. The new addition to the resort is the sommelier, Manuel who is a delightful young man and very knowledgeable of all the wines. The wine tasting was superb and go prepared to drink a few glasses. The most amazing thing is how Sammy and Miguel seem to know where you are at any given moment anywhere in the Tres Rios resort and just pop in to see if you need anything. At Fishermens they know we will always be in our two favorite lobby chairs each day around 3 for a solara manhattan and a margarita and have them waiting when we get there.

Although we had a wonderful time we were disppointed with several of the services and the food. We did not have an all inclusive package because they wanted to charge us $150US per person, per day. This was ridiculous for us because I'm a vegetarian and we don't drink that much. We were really surprised by prices for food and drinks at the resort. (read more under negatives) Positives: The beach was quiet and in good condition because there are no resorts close on either side. They are working on extending the beach and hopefully cleaning up the sandy water. Our room was beautiful, clean and well stocked. We did leave a $5 tip daily, which some of the other guests seemed to think was too much but the cleaning staff worked hard. The shower was amazing and the jacuzzi on the patio was a nice touch. The grounds were really well kept and we enjoyed exploring the grounds. There are several paths to take and cenotes (swimming holes) on the property. Some of the cenotes are a little smelly but really neat to see. The adult pool was pretty quiet and the service was good at the pool. There are lots of seats and it was fairly empty. The one positive for food was the pizza cafe by the pool. Fresh oven roasted pizza that was very yummy. Negatives...where do I start... We seemed to be one of the only couples on the resort who were not all inclusive and felt that because of that we were treated differently. We did attend the free mexican buffet on Sunday but everything else cost us way too much money. We felt the food portions were very small ($35US for a steak, with 3 potato wedges and a bun and $14US for a starter size salad, I could go on) Drinks were $10US for a pina colada and $4US for a coke without free refills. After the first day and our unexpected $75US buffet breakfast we decided we were going to try and avoid breakfast and only eat lunch and dinner. The food wasn't even that good, we were very disappointed and felt like we were being taken advantage of because we can get better meals with bigger portions and for less money back home. We ended up taking a cab to Playa Del Carmen ($15US one way) to eat because the prices and the food was much better. Kids are everywhere. We did not realize how many families were there, which is fine but kids were running down the hotel hallways at 7am and waking us up. The kids pool had 3 hot tubs in it and none at the adult pool. We really wanted to go into the hot tub but there were always kids and families in there. We never did go into the hot tubs. At the beach people would go and put their stuff on the cabanas early in the morning so if you wanted to sit at the beach you had to go early. This was a little frustrating because we went to the beach one morning at 10am and there was no where for us to sit, so we went to the pool. The sports bar was a joke, 4 tables in a very large and empty lounge. No food, only drinks. 5 TV all showing soccer. Not our ideas of a typical sports bar. Because we were not all inclusive, they also wanted to charge us for activities on the resort. For example, $29US per person to use the Kayaks and $29US per day to use the gym. We would recommend this resort for families but if you want to relax and also have a good time this is not the place.", "Date": "December 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newport, Rhode Island", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Resort\u201d", "Author": "lis62", "ReviewID": "UR90753106", "Content": "I can not even begin to describe my experience at this resort.

We did enjoy the bike tour and tequila tasting also ;) I even had a minor emergency with an eye infection, the concierge staff promptly got me an appointment with an eye doctor in Playa del Carmen and the issue was resolved in a day. Will we go back to Tres Rios? Most Definitely!

Hacienda Tres Rios filled the bill perfectly. The food is excellent - if there is something you want, just ask! We wanted veal scallapini one night at the Italian restauran and asked our waiter (Sr Osbaldo) if they had it. He went to the chef and came back and asked if veal chops would be ok - no problem and they were great. Osbaldo remembered us when we ate in the restauranr 3 days later and even remembered our favorite drinks. We met the Chef (Oscar) by chance in the herb garden -we chatted and were invited for a tour of the kitchen. Quite impressive, exceptionally clean with all areas segregated by duties performed thus no chance of cross contamination. When checking into the hotel guests are assigned a \"main\" concierge - ours was Letty and she was very helpful all week. We never had to reserve chairs by the pool and the service was always excellent. Host/translator Motego from Maryland was everywhere and very accomadating. Especially enjoyed the wine tasting and tequilla tasting! The rooms are beautiful - great beds, lots of marble, flat screen tv with US channels and good wifi in the room. Everyone was very friendly and went out of their way to accomdate your evey wish. Lastly, if you do want to leave this hotel for any excursion, I recommend contacting Luis Enrique Cifuentes (cell 984 130 80 75), an honest cab driver who speaks english well and will take good care of you.

I cannot really address price because we did not pay what most would - as members, we receive DEEP discounts on vacations, under wholesale. First Impression - At first we were not \"wowed,\" as it is a low-key place, they don't do some of the hype that others do (like as one mentioned, you can help yourself to the moist towels, they don't put one in your hand, you can order a drink, they don't put a fruity cheap-booze one in your hand upon arrival). This is not a hyped-up place, it is not a place where people are playing silly games at the pool, no party music blaring there either, nor is there a wild disco at night (there are activities and even karaoke, just no wild and crazy anything). That\u2019s good for some, not so for others, know your own tastes. This place is more of a relaxing, wonderful easy-going time with incredible food and drinks and kind, genuine service. As time passed, ALL 40 OF US became more and more impressed... Resort Design - One in our group took a walk past many other resorts along the beach, and noted the others cram in the beach chairs & tables, the grounds are far more tightly packed to fit in more people. Tres Rios is roomy and plush, spread out, you never feel cramped by other guests. Food - The food at many higher-end all-inclusives looks great, but in our experience, it's often a bit bland, looking MUCH better than it tastes. Here, even the breads and pastries were actually wonderful! The meals in the restaurants were very gourmet, almost \"weird\" in description. But when we took a risk and ordered some things recommended, they were amazing in combo of tastes. Lime cream soup in the Mexican restaurant, mmm. We were perfectly happy with availability of food, there was always something somewhere, and room service 24/7. The PIZZA, oh wow, I do not even really like pizza. Do yourself a favor, go TO the pizza oven cafe (tables tucked under huge trees with big blue umbrellas and an open fire oven, it is as delightful an outdoor pizza cafe as we could find in any city) so it is fresh and hot when you eat it. It was light, thin dough with deliciously fresh and original ingredients. The raccoon and coatis beg there, which was a free show in itself. Pancho (a coati) steals pizza dough when he can right from the kitchen. More Food - The Pastry Shop off the lobby was a blast! It's espresso drinks to order, and pastries that rotate throughout the day. To have espresso, cappuccino, mochas etc available all day and evening was wonderful! Every time you stop in there's new pastries to try, and they really are tasty, which again is unusual. Booze - I am picky, I don't bother drinking cheap booze \u2013 bad taste and bad hangovers. All other all trips to Mexico all-inclusives I actually do not drink much because the quality of alcohol is so cheap, suspect the few brand-name bottles are replenished with cheaper booze, and drinks are notoriously weak. Here they have the real thing and no cheap brands to be found anywhere - Don Julio Reposado, 1800 Anejo, Grand Marnier, Jack Daniels, Crown, Chivas 12-year, Absolut in various flavors, Barcardi, actually GOOD red wine (never had that before at a resort in Mexico), etc etc. A review here mentions no Corona, but ironically, Corona in Mexico is like Bud in the states - it's known to be cheap not very good beer by the Mexicans. The have Tecate (great with lime) and one other in a green can, Coors Light, maybe more, I didn\u2019t order any. Room \u2013 We were first on the bottom floor Mangrove Jr. Suite. We really didn\u2019t like the view at all, so we asked NICELY for a change, and they accommodated at no extra charge since they had room. All rooms are huge, VERY clean, and classy. Loved the big glassed walk-in shower. Water was hot and plentiful, towels fluffy. The beds very comfortable, some sort of pillow top mattress. Fluffy pillows, crisp white sheets with a duvet cover, no old-style bed spreads! Flat screen TVs, a couple of English channels, HBO in English, in-room free wifi that worked fine for us. Turn-down service in the evening. We saw the cleaning lady early every morning in the halls, and our room was done each day when we were for breakfast. When we had a question about the a/c and also the safe, the staff came promptly, always with a wonderful, helpful attitude. Beach - WONDERFUL beds on the beach!!! The service there was lovely, they would bring whatever we wanted, and would warn us if it was an item that would take a long time to cook and deliver. Grounds - immaculate. Do take a walk down to the river end of the property along the beach, over the bridge, it's just beautiful over there. The staff is out early clearing debris to be sure if you feel like walking into the river water area, it is clean and safe on your bare feet. There is a hammock dock there that is picture-perfect for a photo with which to taunt your friends at home. Actually, there are great little seemingly private places to sit with various gorgeous views all over the property\u2026 Service - they have done a great job of training everyone to not only say hola, but to do so genuinely. Many places in the US clearly force employees to say hello, but here it did not ever feel forced. We loved that they act with friendliness and service, but do not act subservient. For example, on more than one occasion, we noted that a few of the the house keeping staff would walk through the hall giggling and having fun together, clearly having a good time at work, and then would of course all say hello as we passed. Other places they look solemn then say hello because they have been told to. Anything we asked for the staff seemed to take responsibility for and would pursue it, whether information, or cream for my coffee. One night a large table of us wanted to eat Italian - they told us it would be a long time to create a big table. At other places, that would be the end of it. But here they offered to seat us immediately in the main dining room, yet have us order off the same Italian menu. How delightful! Emmanuel at the front seemed to always be bustling about, from taking luggage, to making sure we were booked for a tour when the travel agency rep could not be found. Emmanuel then followed up with a voice mail to our room to verify completion of the task. NOTE: Saturday is their big check out/check in day, so expect a bit less attention if you are arriving that day. We came in on Wed and left on Sun, so we experienced great service and attention. Biz Service - We had arranged for 1 group dinner that was going to be outside. But we then decided it would be too cool at 7 pm. Most places would have balked at less than one day's notice. We thought at least we could have a conference room somewhere. With no fuss or push-back, they instead merely set us up in one of the restaurants that was closed for the evening - a much nicer option than we expected! The eco-friendly aspect of the resort is nice, yet not in-your-face; you do not feel you must be a tree hugger to be there. We did not do the cenote snorkeling and property tour but our son did, and he said it was amazing to see how deep and clear the cenotes are, with underwater cavernous areas that extend underground from what looks like a small river. Spa - We got a couples massage, very well done. Enjoyed both the sauna and steam before. The manager told us they would use a heated cinnamon rub, but I do not like that scent. So she insisted on bringing to me all their oils to decide what we wanted instead. I could tell she really wanted us to have a wonderful experience. In summary, we were not sure about the place when we arrived, as USA tourists have come to expect a lot of sizzle from a nice resort. This place was more of a warm, slow melting that left us ALL quite sad to leave by day 6, and realizing there was still so much more to taste and see, so many more places around the property to relax into, restaurants to try, free bikes to ride, kayaks to paddle, sailboats to sail, beach walks to take, hammocks to swing in, etc....!

We did not choose your hotel but the Wedding was taking place at your resort and the entire group was staying there and it was convenient to be in the same location as everyone. The positive about Hacienda Tres Rios is the beauty and cleanliness of the outdoor locations available to the guests. The pool area and the lounging beds on the beach were wonderful and the beachfront was kept clean and debris free. The bed in our hotel room, even though we did not receive a king bed was comfortable and provided a nice place to lay our head at night. The steps the management is taking to keep the hotel green and environmentally friendly are commendable and the staff was always quick with a \u201chola\u201d wherever you went. Unfortunately, that\u2019s where my positive comments end and my challenges begin. The remainder of our stay was very disappointing. I must first preface my comments with the fact that my husband and I returned from a trip to The Dreams Resort in Puerto Vallarta in February. The two hotels are on opposite ends of the spectrum which is certainly not what we expected, given the price we paid was comparable. That was the only thing Hacienda Tres Rios had in common with Dreams Puerto Vallarta. It all began at check-in when there was only one person at the front desk checking in guests when they should have been aware of the arrivals for the day and been staffed appropriately. We were expecting a welcome drink upon our arrival when exiting the vehicle, like we did at Dreams, but instead had to chase down a waiter that was walking aimlessly around the lobby with the signature drink. There were fresh moist towels behind the front desk that once again we were expecting to be handed upon check in (like Dreams) but they just sat there and never got offered to any guests. They must be for the Front Desk staff and Bellmen to use throughout their long exhausting day. All over the resort the service was non-existent unless you tipped heavily. We booked the Endless Luxury All-Inclusive plan for the value and convenience it offered and it clearly states on your website that service tips and taxes are included. We definitely are not against tipping when the service warrants it and in fact tipped heavily on our Dreams vacation, but at Hacienda Tres Rios we consistently got our own drinks and food no matter if we were at the pool or on the beach. In our book tips are earned, not expected! Service was consistently slow or non-existent in the outlets as well. One incident I remember vividly was during breakfast at the Casa Las Islas buffet at 8am when the restaurant was not even half full we were seated and waited 10 minutes without any servers approaching us. After getting frustrated, I proceeded to get up and pour my husband and me our own coffee and my own mimosa. When the server did arrive he didn\u2019t look surprised at all and didn\u2019t even apologize for the wait or lack of service. We had another disappointing encounter in the Mexican restaurant, El Alebrije on our last evening. We arrived at 6:30pm when the restaurant opened and there were only 4 other tables occupied by resort guests. We were seated and waited 15 minutes to even be approached by any servers to give us water and take our drink order. We finally ordered our three course dinner at 7pm, an appetizer, Soup and Main Entr\u00e9e. Our first course arrived 45 minutes later and was to be a hot appetizer and it was ice cold. Our second course was skipped completely (not at our request) perhaps it was just too much for them to handle. When the main course finally arrived the veal was overcooked, crispy and cold as well. At this point we left the restaurant and told the hostess of our disappointment. An hour later, we received a call from the Restaurant Manager apologizing and offering us a free dinner! Did you get that, A FREE DINNER . . . remember we booked an Endless Luxury All-Inclusive plan, how generous of him! Perhaps he could have taken a little time to research our reservation and not have made such a ridiculous offer to us the evening prior to our departure. All around the food was mediocre at best and honestly we get better Mexican food locally here in Colorado. However, we did have one spectacular dinner at the Porto Bello Italian restaurant. The service was good, the waiter was pleasant and the food was delicious. Unfortunately, it couldn\u2019t make up for the other unfortunate dinning experiences. The guest room halls were always littered with room service dishes and we often would see the same dishes in the halls for up to 24 hours. We had to get our own amenities from the housekeeping carts since they are strictly one use each due to their small size and the housekeeper did not replace daily. Our room was consistently not made-up until at least 4pm and one evening we came back from a day at the pool, showered, changed for dinner and had to go to the front desk at 6:30pm and request our room be cleaned. There was always a moldy stench in the air that we could not get rid of, and clothes never really dried due to the humidity. All of our clothes returned home with a horrible smell . It was just an all around disappointing trip. Perhaps the part that truly upsets me the most is during the wedding reception we attended, I glanced up to notice the Bride cutting her own wedding cake while the servers stood at the bar chatting. Please tell me this is not your policy. I am a Wedding Coordinator myself and was appalled at this site. I quickly took charge and cut and plated the cake as your servers ever so graciously held out plates for me \u2013 seriously? I finally put the knife down and politely asked they finish with serving the cake. I am from a Hospitality background of over 15 years and perhaps this is the reason I am so critical of service and attention to detail. Perhaps, we were unlucky and just caught your staff on a bad week, or maybe you were short staffed due to illness. I don\u2019t feel these to be true, but I do sincerely believe your hotel has some serious service issues and your employees need to be reprogrammed that no matter what kind of tips come their way (if any) each and every guest deserves to be treated equally, their needs met, and more importantly exceed all expectations! Being a Wedding Coordinator I frequently have brides that are looking for destination weddings and I am positive that Hacienda Tres Rios will not be one that they choose. I wish your property success in the future!", "Date": "November 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, MN", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful resort, friendly staff, relaxed elegance\u201d", "Author": "KTSunny", "ReviewID": "UR88641796", "Content": "We stayed at the Hacienda Tres Rios from Nov. 13 \u2013 Nov. 20. This was our first stay here, actually first stay at any resort associated with Sunset resorts, though we first purchased in 2002. That year we also bought into Palace Resorts, and have stayed at several of their resorts through the years, mainly because we spent more and had more incentives to use Palace. We first made our reservation last March and had decided to stay at the Royal Sunset on the beach in the hotel zone. A couple months after making the reservation and paying for our week, we were informed that Royal Sunset would be closed for renovations during the week of our vacation. We were offered a stay at either the Sunset Lagoon or Hacienda Tres Rios. We chose the latter since it was so new, and we weren\u2019t disappointed! We had requested an ocean view and a king size bed, but ended up with the view and 2 double beds. We called and requested a different room and were told that there wouldn\u2019t be any available until Monday, and that we would be moved at that point. However, after sleeping on the double bed, it was so very comfortable that we let them know the following day that we would keep the original room. I have a problem with hard, \u201ctoo firm\u201d beds, but their beds are great \u2013 fluffy feather beds on top of the mattress just lulled me to sleep. Also, the room didn\u2019t have the 2 person Jacuzzi that some rooms did, it had a sofa instead. This was fine with us as we are not huge fans of the Jacuzzi that Palace Resorts include in their rooms. We thought the sofa was a far more usable feature! The rooms are very comfortable with a table and chairs and a balcony with tables and chairs as well. There is a small refrig that is restocked daily, and the bathroom is well arranged with a separate little room with the toilet \u2013 a huge walk in shower and a sink and large mirror and vanity in between. There is a coffee maker and real cups, saucers and spoons. They do supply terry robes for each person. There is 24-hour room service, but we didn\u2019t use it, so can\u2019t comment on it. When you first check in, you are introduced to your personal \u201cconcierge\u201d. This person, ours was Tatiana, sits down with you and explains how things work. She told us the days that the Italian and Asian restaurants were open and that if we wanted to eat there we would need to make reservations the day before by 3:00 p.m. She also briefly went through the \u201ctours\u201d they offer (which are right on the grounds and include visiting their nursery, biking, snorkeling in their cenote, and/or kayaking in their rivers). She mentioned that we each were entitled to a lobster dinner at the restaurant of our choice, and a 30 minute massage (you need to pay the tax of $12 for this). She gave us the times of the daily (Monday \u2013 Friday) complementary van to and from Playa del Carmen and told us about the other tours that for members are 50% of the stated price. She then invited us to the sales presentation, to \u201clearn what is new about our membership\u201d. For going to this, she offered to make one of our massages a 50 minute one with no tax charge and give us tickets to the Thursday evening dinner and horse show. We agreed to attend, and were told that it would be Sunday morning and would begin with breakfast upstairs in the Mexican restaurant that is not open for breakfast except for the sales events. I know that many people have complained about how awful the sales presentations are, but I guess I need to say it wasn\u2019t so bad. Since we are owners at another \u201cvacation club\u201d in Mexico and multiple timeshares in the U.S., we are used to the idea of these updates, and have come to see the time as a way to find out what is going on and what is offered. They of course would like to take all your other timeshares in \u201ctrade\u201d and have you \u201cupgrade\u201d. They were surprised at how cheaply we got into the system \u2013 again the time we purchased, we had already bought into Palace and just kept saying \u201cno\u201d, until it got so cheap that we gave in. We listened to all they had to say and then simply said that we liked all our timeshares, enjoyed the variety, and were not interested in upgrading. The representative was disappointed, but polite, and we got our \u201cgifts\u201d and parted amicably. I also have read reviews complaining about everything, from the food to the service and frankly, those who complain about this place I believe won\u2019t be happy anywhere! We found the staff friendly and helpful and everything, everywhere spotlessly clean! The food was for the most part, excellent!. The only meal that we found just average was the first night. We ate dinner in Casa la Islas, the buffet restaurant, and the food again was average, as seems to be for buffets. The same place for breakfast was excellent, with custom made omelets, tasty side dishes, wonderful juices, fruits, breads, and pastries and friendly and helpful waiters. Dinner in the Italian restaurant was really good and also, we loved the steaks for dinner at the Hacienda Grill. Some people we talked to believed that the Grill \u2013 which doubles as the pool bar and restaurant during the day \u2013 was closed for dinner. Not true \u2013 they have a different menu, still serve the same great drinks and also wine with your meal. This was our favorite dinner restaurant. We had our lobster dinner at the Mexican restaurant ,and the lobster dinner is a set menu that is the same where ever you have it. The dinner menu at the Mexican restaurant looked really good, and we intended to get back there, but for some reason never did. On Sunday night they held a welcome Mexican fiesta with a great buffet, toasts of tequila when you first got there and unlimited drinks. We didn\u2019t get to the Asian restaurant as we first planned to go there on Thursday night, but then instead went to the dinner/horse show instead. With the fact that certain restaurants are only open certain nights, you really need to plan things out ahead of time. Usually when on vacation, we sleep in and then eat only 2 meals, a large breakfast and dinner. However, since we wanted to try lunch at the Pizza place by the pool, one day we just had fruit and pastries for breakfast and then pizza for lunch. Another \u201cdon\u2019t miss\u201d. There is a menu, but you can basically just tell them what you want on your pizza and they make it, cook it in the brick oven, and serve with your choice of drink, really great! E.g., pepperoni is not on any menu items, but it is available if requested. About the dinner/horse show \u2013 don\u2019t miss it! Whether you go to the sales presentation and get it as a gift, or you pay for it, just go. Unfortunately for us, Thursday was the only day it rained \u2013 and it poured! We thought they might cancel it, but they didn\u2019t. It is quite a ride \u2013 you go into Cancun and then turn off some road and go to the \u201cEquestrian Center\u201d. It is a large stable, with a large capacity to serve food, drinks, and entertainment. Normally you would eat outdoors and enjoy the entertainment following dinner. We ate indoors and then heard by word of mouth that we would simply eat and go back to the resort. We happened to be eating with a really nice Canadian couple we had met, and they said that in their van, they had been the only passengers, and if it stopped raining, they planned to stay for the show and invited us to ride back with them. So, we all went outside \u2013 up the stairs, past horses in their stalls to a large deck set up with tables and chairs, more food, enthusiastic and friendly drink servers and a stage show. And \u2013 it wasn\u2019t raining! So \u2013 we found our original van driver, who had the others in the van and was frantically looking for us. We told him we were staying for the show. The next day we found that others in the van would have preferred to stay as well. I think there was a bit of confusion going on. Anyway, the stage show had a lot of singing and dancing and costumes and was great. Then we went down to the arena to see the horse show. They gave us cushions to sit on (so you wouldn\u2019t get wet), and we began to watch the show. The rain began to pick up, and so we decided after the act to leave \u2013 everyone had the same idea. They directed us to a different part of the seating area that had a roof. So, we sat down again and saw a beautiful little girl \u2013 maybe 10 years old \u2013 riding a horse and singing like an angel. She sang as her horse made dressage moves, and it was enchanting! Then the rain picked up, and it began pouring and still the girl sang her heart out and finished her act. After that, it was raining continually, so we left. But, I\u2019m sure if not for the rain, the rest of the show would be well worth going! One day we took the Tigrillo tour. They take you on sort of a \u201ctrain\u201d pulled by a jeep and first you go to their nursery and hear about their efforts to grow various tropical plants used on the grounds. Then you go to their cenote, where everyone puts on a life preserver. If you want to snorkel, they will give you a mask and snorkel, and you can jump into the cenote. Evidently some people actually snorkel down the river to where it goes into the Gulf, but everyone in our group opted for a 10 minute snorkel and then got into kayaks. The kayaking was a very easy trip of maybe 10-15 minutes through a canopy of trees and bushes. The whole trip took about 1.5 hours, and we had a fun group of people. As others have reported, the beach right in front of the resort is not great as the river water mixing with the Gulf. The water looks a bit brown, but you can walk down the shore a bit and find very nice and inviting areas to swim. Twice we took the free van into Playa del Carmen. They will either drop you off on 5th Ave for shopping, or take you to their sister resort, the Sunset Fisherman. The first time, we had them drop us off at their closest point to the ferry dock and took the ferry to Cozumel and went SCUBA diving for the afternoon. Since the last van returning to Tres Rios leaves at 5:00, and we took the 6:00 ferry from Cozumel, we needed to take a taxi back \u2013 with tip it was $20. If you ferry to Cozumel, buy 1-way tickets. There are two ferry operators, each running every other hour, and a roundtrip ticket forces you to one operator\u2019s schedule, perhaps making you wait an extra hour for that ferry operator. While they are scheduled to leave every hour on the hour, they seem to leave about 10 minutes late. The second time we used the transportation to Playa, we went to the Sunset Fisherman Resort. We took the 9:30 van there and the 2:00 van back. That resort is older, much smaller, but is right on a beautiful beach. If you have experienced the very small stretch of sandy beach in Playa del Carmen in the past \u2013 you need to check out their great job of rehabbing the beach! It is now a wide area of beautiful white sand, just outstanding. Anyway, while there, you can use the beach, pool, lounges, etc. and can also have drinks and/or lunch there. You can also walk down the beach till you get to the ferry dock and then walk around the shopping area there. A really nice way to spend the day! Something that is offered, though not stressed nearly enough is their \u201cSensory Adventure\u201d. This is really different and involves a short walk into the jungle, where you close your eyes, put on blind folds and are led along and through things and experience different smells, sounds, sensations. I\u2019m not going to describe any more, as I don\u2019t want to ruin the adventure, but it was very different than anything we had experienced and kind of \u201cmind broadening\u201d. Don\u2019t miss it! If there is a problem with Hacienda Tres Rios, I believe it lies in their communications. I think they just haven\u2019t figured out how to help people get the most out of their weeks\u2019 stay, so with that idea in mind, here are my suggestions. \u2022 When you first arrive, plan out your week, considering what days different restaurants are open, when you may want to do the sensory adventure, tours, go to Playa del Carmen, etc. \u2022 Go to the Concierge desk \u2013 there will be one person sitting behind the sign Concierge. There will always be others sitting there, who may or may not ask if they can help, but wait until you can sit down and make your reservations. \u2022 Though you can make reservations as you go along, many times the vans going to Playa del Carmen (holds only 10 guests) may be full at the time you want to go or come back, so if you can make your reservations \u2013 both ways. You can always get a cab (about $14) but free is better. \u2022 Again, each couple is entitled to one lobster dinner. It can be served at any restaurant, but you must let them know a day ahead of time. \u2022 Our Concierge originally told us we were each to get a 30 minute massage and said that there would be two people at a certain desk in the lobby that could help us with that. When we tried that, we were told we needed to talk to our original Concierge, who wasn\u2019t there that day. What we found is if you go directly to the Spa \u2013 down the hall past the Sports bar and dessert place/business center, past the car rental desk and then up one flight, you can make your massage appointments. \u2022 When you want a drink during the day, the best plan is to walk over to the Hacienda Grill by the pool. If you are sitting by the pool, they will bring your drinks to you. \u2022 On the terrace outside Casa la Islas, they often have ethnic food demonstrations, so check the calendar for times and subjects. \u2022 Wi Fi service works well some times in your room. If you are having a problem, it always works in the lobby, and there are two computers in the business center that you can use. \u2022 They really don\u2019t want you to feed the animals, but there are 3 coatis, cute animals about the size of a raccoon, with long brown tails that sit up and beg, and many people feed them fruit. \u2022 Don\u2019t expect American efficiency; this is Mexico, and you are on vacation \u2013 smile and say \u201cHola\u201d to everyone and relax. You will have a great time!", "Date": "November 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cForget the bad reviews - this place is not perfect but still awesome\u201d", "Author": "CDR37", "ReviewID": "UR88216847", "Content": "Let me first start off by saying that I had a lot of apprehension about staying at this resort after I had paid for my entire 10 day stay at Tres Rios in advance. We travelled from January 2 to 12, 2010. The negative reviews of that time had to do with time share sales, the beach, and the food. Though it has been a few months, I remember the trip like it was yesterday and will share my experience. We arrived in Mexico after taking a connection on US Airways through Phoenix. Immigration was smooth. Duty free was lined up and was very slow so it is better to avoid that store until you are back at the airport for your return trip. We took the luggage on the free baggage carts and proceeded towards the exit. There are about 15 men who block the corridor leading to the exit. They have official looking badges saying something to the effect that they are Cancun transportation authority staff. One of them took us to a table, asked us if we needed transportation (I had arranged a private van in advance over the Internet) and then proceeded to try to pitch us on free tickets we could receive if we attended a time share presentation. At that point I said No thanks, grabbed my cart and headed for the door. Outside our driver was waiting with my name on a card and we made it to the hotel in about 30 minutes. Cost to the resort for a private shuttle was $50 each way. Well worth it over a share shuttle as you do not have to travel to many hotels as other people get dropped off first. I learned this the hard way in Hawaii. Once off the main highway, there is about a 1KM road through the jungle to the resort. We arrived at night and it was very cool to see the roadside lights leading a path to the resort. We checked in very quickly and made our way to our 3rd floor ocean view suite that had a king bed. Bed bugs were never a problem, nor mosquitos or any other bugs for that matter at any time during our stay. The only wildlife we saw was a raccoon who used to sneak around the outdoor Pizzeria from time to time. We nicknamed him Ricky, a name the staff loved. The next morning we awoke to a beautiful sunrise and a view that is really amazing. Well kept grounds and pools and the ocean as a backdrop. The room was very modern which is what we expected for a one year old hotel. The furniture was high end expresso, a nice couch and table with chairs, and LCD television, lots of storage space, a nice new mattress and lots of pillows. The bathroom was very nice with a 4x8 tile walk in shower, and a private room for a toilet. The safe in the closet worked well and we never had a problem with theft. The room was very spacious and about twice the size of a typical North American hotel room. Maid service was excellent and the sheets, towels, and garbage were changed each day. Our first meal was the buffet breakfast which was not a four seasons buffet but better than most. The people who stay here come from many different nationalities, so they try to serve food that meets everyone's tastes. As this resort was rated the top all-inclusive in Central America, we saw many rich and likely famous Mexican and Latin families eating around us. It is the place to travel to if you are among the elite in Mexico. A Mexican movie star was also there but as I do not watch Spanish movies I wouldn't have been able to pick him out of a police line-up. The breakfast was very good in that they have an omelette/waffle/cooked-to-order egg chef and a large variety of fruit and other items like hashbrowns and meats such as bacon. They also had a large selection of breads, pastries, and my favorite - croissants which were fresh. There was never a shortage of food or tables and we were eating within minutes of arrving each morning. The fresh orange and pineapple juice were also good. This is a very quiet resort and not the place to party. The sports bar is family orientated and more of a place to grab a drink if you are inside than anything else. On one day it rained and they had games planned in this lounge for families which included a pool table contest, a music trivia contest, and other types of games. Outside, there were a lot of lounge chairs to be had and we had our favorite place to sit everyday. We tried the beds on the beach one day and they were taken most of the time but very few chair hogs were at the resort. One group of three young ladies had put two towels on two beds and then proceeded to lie on chairs on the beach. This got me going so I asked them if they were using the beds. They said yes and then made a lame attempt to use one of the beds. I then took one of the towels off the second bed and threw it on their first bed. These chair cows as they were now labelled were the exception at the resort rather than the rule you often hear about at other resorts. As you have to sign in and out your beach towels at the outdoor cafe, people do not leave them lying around on chairs saving a spot for the whole day. We were there in January and the pool was on the chillier side, likely because the temperature drops off at night to the high 60s. It would take me about a minute to get used to the water but once I did I was fine. Most people I watched would dip their toe and then never go in so I had the pool to myself many times. The few I convinced to jump in were fine once they got used to it and would stay in the pool for hours. The few children that were at the pools also did not seem to have a problem with the temperature of the pool as they would play on floating toys for hours. Most were well behaved which was a reflection of their parents and the ambiance of the resort. This was not a McDonalds playland by any means. We did see the kids club group walking around and it looked like the kids where having fun doing what they were doing (crafts, ..) The beach is not the reason to go to this resort. The sand and beach chair are fine but the water not so much. The reason the water is murky is that the fresh water from the cenotes empties into the ocean creating a mixture that is a little briny. While we are not tree huggers we respected what the hotel was doing environmentally and accepted this natural occurance. We did travel to Playa Del Carmen once or twice to sit on the main beach and swim in the turqoise blue water which is picture perfect. That and you can get a massage for $20 an hour near the beach there which my wife took up. We did not do any of the hotel tours around the resort (scent tour, jaguar tour, ...) but we did take the two person kayak out on our own and travelled up the cenote. That was fun as you have to navigate through mangroves to finally get to a dock with a swimming hole. The water is crystal clear and it is fresh water which I prefer to salt water anyway. It was very refreshing. Speaking of saltwater, the pools are all salt water pools so you don't get that chlorine smell in your hair and swim suits. This was very popular in the Red Sea resorts we have stayed at so it was nice to see it adopted here as well. At night they have a show that varies. One night a musician, one night a fire dance show, ... We watched most from our balcony as it has nice chairs that you can sit and relax on. The front desk and concierge staff was excellent. They have a room full of DVDs that you can rent for free. You pick a box, take it to the concierge, and he asks you to sign it out and gives you the DVD which you return the next day. This was a favorite thing to do after dinner as there is no night life and no parties. For lunch they have an outdoor pizzeria which makes pan pizzas that have very fresh toppings. More european style than Pizza hut style, but a nice change. The main place to eat at lunch is the outdoor grill which has an excellent seletion of well presented and prepared foods. My favorites were the jumbo BBQ prawns on rice and the fresh baked tortilla chips and salsa. All the food is prepared on the outdoor grill so it is fresh. In terms of drinks, we never had a problem with poolside service. Often times I was given a new drink before I had even finished the previous one. Want a tip that will work for you in any country you travel to (and I have been to many). Tip both the waiter and bartender on the second day. If you tip on the first day they will expect it everyday. When you tip on the second you thank them for the excellent service the day before, ask them there name, introduce yourself, and give them a nice tip ($10 - $20) for their service the day before. At that point you become their best friend. Yes you paid for an all-inclusive trip but this will put you ahead of everybody else and get you top shelf all the time. By the end of the ten days I had a beverage waiting even before I walked up to say hello. The service was friendly, efficient, and they covered all areas outdoors, from the beach to the pools to the couches near the hotel doors. The food at night was the highlight. I am not sure what world other people live in but having eaten at some of the best hotels and on the best cruise ships in the world, this was up to that standard. It was truly five star. Well presented, always hot, and with sauces and seasonings to die for. Whether it was fish, chicken, steak, or sushi, it was excellent. The deserts were also incredible. Dinner was a highlight to the end of each day. We never ate at the buffet at night so I cannot comment on the food there. One night when the restaurent was at capacity we sat in the buffet area and ordered off the same menu as the restaurent. That was a nice bonus. There were two restaurents open when we were there, not including the buffet area. The spanish restaurent was open every day and served traditional spanish food. Then the main floor restaurent alternated between Italian and Japanese on alternate nights, with the menu changing each time. You can stay two weeks and never eat the same thing twice if you want as the menu is quite varied. They have appetizers, soups, salads, main courses, and desserts each day as well as a chef's special. We also did room service two nights and the quality was as good as the restaurent, though the menu was a little more basic and what you would normally get back home. The clam chowder in a bread bowl was great, as was the steak sandwich. Our room had 2-two litre bottles of water provided each day which we did not use unless we were in the room. The water at the restaurents and pool was fine and we did not get any type of stomach upset while we were there. That is mostly due to the on-site filtration plant the hotel has. In the room we used the ice from the machines as well as the bottled water. All was fine. The only negatives I had during the vacation was renting a car from the on-site vendor and being paranoid of the time share person finding us. First the car story. We wanted to rent a car for two days to check out the Costco in Cancun as well as travel to Chitzen-itcha where the pyramids were. I went downstairs to talk to the rep and he quoted me 80 bucks a day. I went back to my room to use my netbook (the free wireless internet works great in the rooms, around the pool, and even out to the beds on the beach) and booked with the same company on-line and called the company to confirm the car we wanted for $30 and that I could pick it up at the hotel where they had a branch. An hour later I went to the desk and the man there said he was busy and to come back in 30 minutes. When i came back, he could not find the reservation and that the car we wanted had just been rented. In its place he had a compact beater which was rusting out. He then had the gall to start negotiating price with me. Rather than waste a day, we rented it for $50 per day and then I almost lost it when the rental boy starting marking down every scratch on the windshield and body. The car might have been worth $500 bucks back home. I told him that if they tried to charge me a penny for any damage on this rust bucket, I would see that they were tossed out of the hotel. So we rented the car for two days and on return found that the price on the invoice was back to the $79 and they would not negotiate. At this point I lost it and it took everything in my power not to beat the guy across the desk. Instead I went to the front desk and they calmed me down with a couple of vouchers for a massage. If you do decide to rent a car, do not use these rounders. Instead catch the $12 taxi into Cancun where they have reputable car rental outlets. In terms of the time share folks, I had read a lot on this site about the sales people. We were never visited by them when we were outside by the pool but we could see them in the lobby so you never wanted to sit in the lobby for fear of being approached. We also had a person call us once each day to give us our orientation package and I never would call them back. Finally, I told the front desk to have them stop calling each day as I was hear for a vacation and if I wanted to buy a time share I would contact them on my own. In retrospect, I should have just did the five minute orientation and said no when they asked if I wanted to learn more about the resort. I will do this the next time I am there as we are going back for two weeks in January. It is just too beautiful of a resort to not want to stay and eat at. I would recommend this resort to those who want peace and quiet and excellent food and service in a very secluded, safe, and natural environment. Not recommended for those who like to party or need constant activities to keep them entertained. And by all means, do not take the time share tour unless you are prepared to shell out cash for a time share. Even the strongest can get sucked in to buying something they never planned on owning in the first place. If you want a time share, this is a beautiful place to own one and the tour will be worthwhile. Just make sure to keep saying no until you ge the price you want. Otherwise skip the 4 hour presentation as many have stated on here.

If we stayed any place else we would not have been able to 'hang out' other than the wedding activities, so since we didn't have much of a choice, we decided to stay here. Upon check in they had us in a king oceanview room which was fine but we requested a jacuzzi. Upon inspection of the jacuzzi suite room, we found two double beds. When we inquired about a king jacuzzi, they stated that the rooms with jacuzzis only have double beds. Which sort of confused us, but OK we settled on the king ocean view. The first morning my husband woke up with bites all over his stomach and chest. I quickly stripped the sheets to look for bed bugs. We went down to the front desk at 7:30am to ask them to change our sheets (Including the comforter) immediately. We originally were going to change rooms, but we got the 'last' king bed ocean view. We explained we were going to the spa, and would not be back until 10am, so if it could be done by then, that would be great. We arrived back in our room at 10:30am to find it just as we left it. It took them a second reminder to change everything out, and then they put the same comforter on the bed.. I called for a new one immediately and stripped the old one off the bed. The old comforter remained on the floor for the remainder of our stay (5 days). Thankfully no bugs after that. I found the food here a disappointment. The Italian resturant is the only place where I would suggest to eat. For the $185/nt per person, we paid, we did not come anywhere near that with the food due to the fact it was just poor quality. I will say the food that we had for the wedding related activites was very good. They had a welcome buffet on the beach with a bar-b-que theme which was very tasty and edible. I didn't care for the fact there was one bar on site, it was a sports bar, which is fine if you are a sports fan. They permit children in the bar, which was a bit of an inconvenience due to the fact they played with the pool table, thus leaving any adult wanting to play out of luck. There was no lounge/bar where you could just go relax have a quiet drink. We didn't like the fact that the jacuzzi's by the pool were in the 'children's pool' as well as the bar was in that area as well. So you had to make a trade off, either an easy walk to the jacuzzi and easy access to the bar, or an quieter pool. The ocean is as bad as every review states....brown..unappealing. We didn't even attempt going in. I have to say one huge plus was the spa service we recieved. The spa Director, Astrid was very pleasant and set up our appointments prior to arrival. We recieved hot stone massages, and I have to say they were the best I ever had. I am an Event Manager and I have traveled to many hotels with fancy spas, but this treatment was the best ever. I have to say the one 'upside' of the trip.

Instead, we started our stay with pure disappointment. We got to the resort early moving from another resort the previous week. I'm OK with not getting the room until 3pm but we waited for about 4 hours. The concierge gave us the whole rundown of the place and that if we wanted to eat at the restaurants, we have to make reservations by 3pm. And boy, are they strict on that! We didn't get to our room until 330 and when we tried make the reservation, they pretty much said tough luck. I guess I'll chalk that up to experience. We also asked for a single king bed for our room and we ended up getting 2 beds instead. So another zinger there. Even though technically all the restaurants are open, not all are open simultaneously. On some days, only 2 out of 3 are open. On others only 1 of 3. And you really had to get the schedule and book early so you don't forget in case you do a tour or something. We booked for the rest of the week after the first dinner to avoid having to go back and forth and/or make calls. The computers in the room aren't always right. The menu does not change between the days they are open during the week either. We did a short presentation even if we're not planning on buying. So much marketing spiel said to promote it but it's really just another BS story in the end. They pride themselves of having in-room dining 24 hours and can get you ANYTHING you want. We tested that by asking for just desert from one of the restaurants and the in-room dining folks said it's only off their menu. Kind off odd because some other guests said the same thing, but I suspect they did not actually try it and it was hearsay or they also did a presentation. That is why I think the Sunset Group has such a bad rap among lies and scams written about them. The staff is filled with many lies. Lastly, we wanted to have a drink while just waiting for some food by the pool. The bar tender by the other pool was conducting a drinks class. OK fine even though another American gives U.S. folks a bad rap by being such an asswipe by saying \"how about this for a lesson, jack and coke. And then looks at the crowd to try and get support as he's not taking a no for an answer.\" I go by the other out door grill and they said \"use the waiters.\" I'm like.. I\"m here? Why can't you just give me a simple lemonade and a soda? They are so understaffed and probably only have 2 total handling both pool areas. Other negatives. - we found a t-shirt under the sheets with it saying \"sorry\" in the front. thought it was a joke or something. but the shirt was used. We had to get the sheets changed. I'm not sure how this could happen but it did give me the hibbie jibbies. - you're locked in the resort. they do have 3 shuttles to down and pick you to bring you back. But they're not early enough if you wanted to do activities like go to Cozumel. Most of those tours usually want you at the dock like 8am. And the first shuttle does not leave until 8:30am. Taxi is $10-$20 from resort to Playa del Carmen. - If you don't buy the all-inclusive, it's VERY expensive to eat. I saw this was rated 4 stars and they got some awards for best all-inclusive. If you're familiar with Vegas, this place has nothing against Wynn, Bellagio and the Venetian. I mean.. nothing. It's over priced food that'll probably be $60-80 tops for both people sans alcoholic drinks for dinner. OK.. .maybe even $100 but that's really pushing it. There are some plusses but not much. - bed sheets are super high thread count and very comfortable. - there is a pillow service if you want different pillows of different firmness - they turn the beds during dinner time when you're out. They clean in the morning but you have to be very good on your door sign. Else, they can come knocking as early as 9am. - The beach is not as clear as most in Playacar and Playa del Carmen. Not even against Cancun. There is still another corner that has some dark crap floating around. It's not very clear water on the majority of the beach but the water is clearer on one portion on the left side. Not quite swimmable since it's shallow and quite a few reefs or rocks with lots of algae on top. - There are activities to do, but they repeat themselves daily. So again, you can be bored very quickly if you're not the sit by the pool/beach and lie down type. - We had 1 very attentive and very good waiter so far out of 3 dinners from 3 restaurants. The other 2 were just OK. - Tip is supposed to be included in the all-inclusive already, but you're still kinda guilted into giving by the concierge when we validated. I would've given anyway but just kind of sucks you are guilted into it by the concierge when they explain. I'll say if you're seasoned enough or do internet research, you can do just as well for a fraction of the price. Do searches on Sunset Fisherman, Sunset Royal, Tres Rios and you can read many horror stories on their scams on time shares selling. Now take those lies and apply them to when you're actually in the resort. It's too bad. The place is a little charming and does try. It's small compared to what they try to compete against like Mayakoba and the like.", "Date": "November 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tifton, GA", "Title": "\u201cDon't even think about it\u201d", "Author": "lever8651", "ReviewID": "UR86888792", "Content": "First off the bat, My wife and I and several other couples have been taking a fall vacation to the Cancun/Riviera Maya area for twelve years and haven't missed a year. So, I feel qualified to rate this resort in comparison to several others in the area. And, in fact, I felt so \"taken advantage of\" by Hacienda that I've waited over a week before writing this caveat and review. Now I've cooled off but I'm still disgusted with this place. 1. We paid well more than twice what we had ever paid for seven nights all-inc. 2. The food is very good but the restaurant schedule is more limited than anywhere we've ever been, partly due to the fact that the Mexican restaurant is never open for breakfast unless you're willing to sit through their time share/membership/vacation club sales presentation. There are no restaurants on the beach (I don't care what the web site says). 3. There are no bars on the beach. Beach service is pretty good -- limited number of lounges, beds and no palapas. But the drinks are very good -- better liquor than anywhere we've been all-inc. 4. Beach itself is worse than Cancun after the hurricane! Looks pretty good but a few steps into the water and there is debris all over the bottom, dead mangrove and other vegetation. They are literally trying to reclaim some of the eroded beach with trabajadors and wheel barrows, one load at a time dumped onto dead flora. 5. Now, trust me on this one; if you look at the photos on the web site you'll see the pools and you'll see what looks like one of the three rivers meandering through the manicured grounds. Well... not exactly... there are three little creek-like rivers on the property; however, what you see on the brochure is a man-made canal cut into the limestone. It does connect to what they call river number 1, circles through the grounds within the semicircle of buildings and rooms, and exits back into river number 1(rio numero uno). The hotel workers seem to be perpetually trying to vacuum up the silt from the bottom and sides of this \"artificial circle\" so at least half of the circle is so muddy/silty you can't see more than a few inches into the water -- and it stinks! Okay, you with me so far? Well the pristine cenote that you snorkel in and the little stream that flows -- maybe four hundred meters -- out to the sea is the same river number 1 that they draw water from and pump their trapped circle water, silt and sludge back into. If you happen to be enjoying your snorkel run down this pristine, eco park water way, it really is beautiful with Peacock Bass, Snook, Mullet, and colorful crabs until you get to where the filthy water from the inner circle is surging back into this little river. Now you can't see your own hand 12 inches in front of your mask and you'll notice that you smell like the dregs from your old aquarium that you should have cleaned out months before. Bottom line is this friends; I got dying dog sick the night after swimming/snorkling through this waste, was sick all the way home and now, after more than ten days I'm still under the weather. I'm a damn seasoned traveler, a backpacker, always carry doxycycline, and treat questionable water with iodine. Last time I was this sick was in the bush in Vietnam as a Recon Marine. My advise: don't trust Hacienda Tres Rios with your health. 6. We all thought we were hip to the time share pitches. Wrong! We got suckered in at check-in. The young concierge we were told would \"brief\" us on the resort and eco park and give us our armbands, actually sent us to a time share presentation (breakfast in the Mexican Restaurant) When we made it known that we were not interested, we had to almost become belligerent to get out of the room. Four different sales presenters cornered us. And we never got our armbands. We were also told -- and this is still on their website -- that guests at Tres Rios are welcome at any other Sunset Group Property. However, after a fifteen dollar cab ride into Playa to the Sunset Fisherman, we were asked for our armbands to be admitted to the property. We explained that we were not given any and would not need any. Wrong! We were not admitted; we walked back into Playa, and caught a $14 cab back to Hacienda Tres Rios. We confronted our \"personal\" conceriege about the situation. She checked with her supervisor who told her to tell us that the armbands and other facilities were for vacation club members only. In spite of our $1300 per person/per week we were commoners intruding on the elite. I felt like Rodney Dangerfield at the Groundhog Day Country Club -- think I've got my movies right? In all fairness to this resort, the food was great, the staff were the best we've ever been served by, the drinks are top notch, and the rooms are perfection. We had a good time, all in all.

We are owners and attended as members update and they tried to sell us an upgrade to the new buildings. We declined and enjoyed the free massages and the rest of our vacation.

What a delightful trip. Our check in went very quickly. The time share was mentioned by the young lady checking us in, but that was the end of that. We wore no bracelets during our week there and we really couldn\u2019t figure out why that was. We saw several people wearing bracelets and they had at least 4 or 5 different colors. The room we had was at the bottom of the U-Shaped resort on the third floor so we looked out on the pool area towards the beach and we could even see Cozumel most days. It was a very beautiful sight from our balcony looking out over the resort. The room was very spacious and very comfortable with the king size bed, sitting area, small table and chairs, large flat screen, refrigerator, walk in shower and separate toilet. We enjoyed sitting on the beach every day.. They had nice loungers and very nice beach beds. We had read about how bad the beach was. However, the dark material along the shoreline was organic matter that washed into the ocean from one of the rivers on the property and settled on the bottom close to shore. I went in the water several times a day and about 10 feet out the bottom turned white again. It was not mucky walking through the organic matter. We watched workers taking the organic matter out and carrying it away in wheelbarrows where they would dry it and then use it as compost for their large nursery. There were basically two pools that meandered through the property. Both were huge. From the beginning of the pool closest to the resort to the end of the second pool by the beach, it probably extended almost two blocks. The first pool was the quiet pool with little nooks and crannies. The pool closest to the beach was the active pool. This pool also had three hot tubs on one side of the pool that had cool, warm and hot water. A full service bar was set up at the end of the pool closest to the beach that served the pool and beach. At the center of the two pools was a nice restaurant for lunch and an ala carte at night that also had a full bar. The food and wine selection couldn\u2019t have been better. We went to an ala carte restaurant every night. Guests get lobster with their meal one night during the week and you pick the restaurant. We had our lobsters at the steak restaurant and it was a very nice meal. Some reports we read did not like the ala carte food. It sounded like they were complaining that you could not get spaghetti at the Italian restaurant or enchiladas at the Mexican restaurant. Neither one was on the menu but all you had to do was ask for a food item any place you were and they were more than glad to provide that food item even though it was not on the menu. Otherwise, the food at all the ala carte restaurants was very good with excellent presentations. The buffet we really enjoyed for breakfast and one or two lunches. The presentation was always impressive and the food was great. There may have been smaller portions on the buffet than some people liked but we didn\u2019t need large quantities so we could try different things. There was a brick oven pizza place where we ate lunch a couple of times. The pizza place was next to the pool about halfway to the beach with umbrellas and tables in it\u2019s own outside space. They had a number of pizzas on the menu but we ordered our pizzas with toppings we wanted and they were happy to do our special pizzas. Waiters were serving and taking orders at the pools and on the beach. They served a lot of pizza poolside for any and all that wanted one. Their entertainment every night was very good and enjoyable. One evening they had a Caribbean Night around the pool with a 7 piece band and two singers. They played while we ate from a buffet set up at the pool closest to the beach. The buffet was top notch with some great choices. The band was very good and made for a wonderful evening. We noticed a sign in the lobby one day advertising a world buffet and a show from Melissa in their show room. We decided to go and see what it was all about. Again, they did a fantastic job on the food in the buffet and the show that Melissa put on was one that you could see in Las Vegas. She is a very talented singer and dancer and had six dancers with her. It was a very fast pace show with lots of costume changes and some great dancing and singing. After the show we went to the lobby where they had a saxophone player playing. He was very good and it was a relaxing atmosphere in the evening breeze. We saw Melissa and her group come in the lobby and visited with her briefly and took pictures. She is delightful and a very talented lady. They had a fire show one night on the resort grounds that was very entertaining for the whole family. The service at Hacienda Tres Rios was exceptional. Every employee we encountered was pleasant, helpful and very service orientated. They were there to assist and make sure our time there was very enjoyable. One activity we really liked at the resort was the special activities in the afternoons. We attended three cooking classes put on by one of their chefs. We learned about the tastes of the Yucatan, three different moles and guacamole and salsas which we really enjoyed. Each chef would demonstrate how the foods are made, cooked, etc. and then we got to try them all. They also had a wine tasting one afternoon to try the eight different wines available at each of the restaurants provided from one Mexican winery. Tasting techniques and a little about each wine started the tasting. All of the wines were exceptional and very good and heads and shoulder above most resort house wines we have had. Another afternoon they had a tequila tasting. We tasted eleven different tequilas. Our tasting host told a little about each tequila and for each one we got a new glass. From the class we got an education in how different tequilas can be. Also while we were there we took their bicycle tour through the property where we saw several cenotes, their plant farm and the paths through the jungle. Another day we went on a tour of the plant farm operation and then jumped in one of the cenotes with mask and snorkel and drifted down one of the rivers into the ocean. It was a fun activity. All in all, the week at Hacienda Tres Rios was one of the most enjoyable weeks we have had in the Riviera Maya. The facility, room, food, service, drinks, etc. from start to finish were top notch. We would recommend this resort in a heart beat!!", "Date": "November 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Detroit, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay at a great resort\u201d", "Author": "Treeguy001", "ReviewID": "UR85147083", "Content": "We stayed here for 4 nights during a split stay.

The food could be better. We experienced a rather average buffet with food that had been sitting around too long. Most of the restaurants at night have a dress code. (The exception is the poolside restaurant - which also happens to have the best food.) It would have been nice to experience the Mexican restaurant, but we were there to relax and spend time on the beach, etc - so the thought of getting all dressed up for dinner just didn't sound like fun. The resort could really use a more casual, \"fun\" evening restaurant - maybe with live music or something to liven up the resort's evening atmosphere. Most evenings found us in the town of Playa del Carmen (highly recommended!) at some local place or another. Due to the location of HTR, we ended up spending quite a bit on cab fare back and forth from the resort to Playa del Carmen because althought the resort is lovely - there is *nothing* going on at night. It's very quiet and was too quiet for us personally. That said, the location of HTR is special because of the spectaular access to the cenotes. We took the \"Jaguar Tour\" our first day here and I highly recommend that - you spend some time snorkeling in the cenote, which is the clearest water you will ever see - and then you sea kayak all the way down the cenote to where it meets the ocean and back.

We all traveled from different places, so by the time I arrived at 9:30 pm, everyone was already there (due to my late plane). The trip from Cancun was pretty short...not quite 30 minutes, and as we turned off of the highway, we traveled down a secluded road, with security to check us in, the low jungle/mangroves all around us. By the time I got out of the vehicle, I was so excited and anxious to see all of my friends. Erick showed me around and helped me to locate my friends having dinner. I was absolutely in awe of the beauty of the hotel. I had done a great deal of research prior to my trip, but you have to see this place in person in order to completely appreciate it. Our rooms were incredible-3 bathrooms, 2 bedrooms, dining/living room, balconies, and roof-top jacuzzi overlooking the sea. The beds were sooo comfortable. There was plenty of space for all of us to hang our clothes and put them away. Our fridges were stocked with Dos XX, sodas, and bottled water all week. The in-room dining staff was absolutely wonderful! Thank you all so much! Even when we knew the hotel was a bit busy, we always got our food and beverages in a timely manner. The housekeepers were always available with fresh, clean towels--which we were always in need of. We would leave in the mornings and come back to wonderfully clean rooms! (How I miss that! :)) Oh, and the showers and bathrooms were very nice. Loved all of the marble! Now the food....well, it was five-star all-around. Being in a group of 6 people, I was pretty much able to taste everything. We went to the Asian-fusion restaurant twice (because we loved it so much!) We had incredible service there, as well. We loved the sushi! We also went to the Mexican restaurant once for brunch during our timeshare presentation (I'll tell you about that shortly) and it was great! I wasn't sure about Mexican food for breakfast, but there were omelet stations and fresh fruit--but the best part was watching a woman make fresh tortillas and cooking them to order. We had mimosas (and more mimosas) and it was great. Dinner there was also fabulous! We did try the cricket empenadas! (At least most of us :)) Our waiter recommended the Mexican specialty plate which wasn't on the menu for me---Thank you! Again, dinner here was wonderful! We also went to the Italian restaurant. It was my birthday and we had special reservations. The food was fantastic. But the best part was at the end of the meal. Everyone sang to me as an adorable and BIG cake was brought to our table. And that cake was HEAVENLY! Our waiter recommended the Mayan coffee for me--and what a great show! Thanks for a great birthday! :) Okay, so those were the fine-dining restaurants. Now my group and I...we love to eat! We spent a couple of long days at the pool and received spectacular service. It is hard to remember everyone's names, as they were all so wonderful! We loved the pizza place with all of their specialties and the grill---Loved the grilled shrimp. The customer service was top-notch. I was able to order a special salad and they even created large platters for us to munch on. Just watch out for the birds!! Drinks were always plentiful and service was even available to us out on the beach beds! Our last day was a Saturday and we had a great time at the pool--thank you, Sergio--wish you all the best! And thanks to all of the cooks who brought out the samples of the amazing food not available on the menu--coconut shrimp, sauteed crab tostadas.... The buffet was decent. I'm not much of a buffet fan, but it was nice to have a quick choice for breakfast. One morning we were in a rush and the hostesses let us go in and get breakfast to-go! They were so sweet! We managed to get to the cafe on our last night. What incredible desserts and pastries! I am a coffee drinker so having an espresso machine there was great! The two men working there were wonderful and even went to get me a Grand Marnier and recommended other liquors to try with my espresso. This was the night I met Chef Oscar. He was so very nice to us and I had to thank him for all of the wonderful food! Just wish we had had the chef's dinner :( I think I've reviewed all of the restaurants--and I hope I've been able to relate what a wonderful time we had EATING! Of course though, even though the food was fantastic--it was the service that made it so special!! I said I'd report on the time-share presentation. Well, I was pretty apprehensive about all of it, to be honest. I'd been looking forward to this trip for 6 months, so I'd read all of the reviews here on TripAdvisor. Some of them were pretty awful, especially in regards to the time share schpeel. It was my birthday, so my friend and I woke up ready to either cancel or reschedule our 9:30 appointment. But we all decided to tough it out. In all actuality, the demographics of our group may have been a deciding factor in the treatment from the presenters....but it really wasn't all that terrible. It did last longer than initially stated, but we knew we were getting free transportation to Playa del Carmen--and we got to eat. Some of the information was interesting and our salesman did his best (I told you it was my birthday, right? He ordered and we drank 2 bottles of champagne!) and yes, a couple of other sales managers came over to our table and tried different tactics...great deals waved in front of us...but all in all--i guess it could of been a lot worse according to the other reviewers. Four of my friends were able to get tickets to Xel-Ha/tour of Tulum out of it, as well. (Two were free--two highly discounted--and if the other two of us had wanted to go...well, it would of been a great deal more expensive--even after half-off). But that was fine--part of being a large group means we could do different things--I had already saw Tulum, and Akumal has the most AMAZING snorkeling!!! The beach was nice. We all loved the natural beauty of it and the entire resort. We went kayaking and saw of the damage from the hurricane 5 years ago so we understood why the beach wasn't like the beach at Playa, Tulum, or even Akumal. And we were okay with it. The first night I jumped in and a couple days later I explored the shallow waters of what looks like a lagoon with clear blue waters. My friends had a great time jumping off of the dock--I had fun seeing all of the tropical fish, giant jellyfish, and barracudas! :) Onto nightlife...I tried to make it to some of the shows....but ended up catching the very end of the Mayan fire show; everyone else said it was great. We listened and danced to Caribbean music in the sports bar, and some of us joined in on casino night and the auction. Mostly though, we sat outside of the sports bar and had drinks in the evenings when we were not in Playa. I knew beforehand that Tres Rios would be very luxurious and romantic. That was fine for all of us, and as one of the singles in our group, I enjoyed the peace and quiet. It was so relaxing and rejuvenating. (Thanks, Daniel, for the wonderful massage!) A couple of nights, though, we wanted to go out and see what the nights were like in Playa. We found out that the resort has an entertainment team. They will take you into town and to Coco Bongo, if you so wish. We decided against that and went out on our own. It probably equaled to be of the same expense, but we still had a great time! If you choose to go out you have to call a taxi, which is kind of expensive, but it is the safest way to travel at night. During the day, the collectivo is the way to go! Hacienda Tres Rios is a phenomenal resort! The Riviera Maya is paradise and Tres Rios is one of its hidden gems! I was sad to leave...but of course it is good to be home! Back to work I go!

The water is warm but it's about as red as they come, thanks to the ever growing mangrove all around. The beach are is rather small considering but it has a long way to go to be up to par. The big beds are a nice comodity and something different and thats good. But the water...\"Thumbs down for that\" You'll have to drive down to Playa de Carmen for better than that and if you do, stop by the Sunset Fishermen for a cool drink. Keep in mind, this is a rather new facility and staff and there's going to be new issues arising here and there. (hopefully not buit you can't get away from that) Take for instance, while we were there the first time in '09, all the facility power went out tempararly in the evening. No fun! ...This time the water main had gone out on two separate days. Fortunately the refrigeraters are well stocked with bottled water but don't try to take a shower or flush the toilets! ! ! So what do you do? Dwell on the negative or enjoy your vacation? ...Exactly! Overall, we had a great experience to say the least. This place is fabulous but don't tell everyone. It's our secret! Kudos to everyone on-board! I can't wait to get back in '11. Hope to see you there!

We arrived at approximately 3 pm, very tired and hungry from a day of travel, anxious to get to our suite which advertised 3 pm check in. We were met by our concierge, a nice young lady and offered a nice juice drink,. 2 hours later we were still trapped by the lady who was basically trying to sign us up for a time share sales presentation, which we repeatedly told her we had no interest in. Our reservation was not based on the requirement that we attend, and we did pay in addition to the exchange a considerable amount for the all inclusive. After getting a bit cranky with her we were \"released\" and allowed to go to our suite. It was insinuated that we would not be able to participate in the resort activities unless we attended the sales tour. This was not a positive start to our vacation. Our suite: Beautiful, marble everywhere, two bathrooms, wonderful balcony with a view of the pool area and the ocean. Crows nest up a circular staircase where you can sun bathe or look at the moon reflecting on the ocean. Best nights sleep ever in a resort, very comfortable. Service: Fantastic! Great attitudes, and willing to go out of their way to satisfy your needs. We became especially fond of Ivan a server at the Hacienda Grill, Food: Average to excellent depending on what you like and what was available. Anything prepared with fresh lime was terrific, wonderful sauces and fresh ingredients.The Tuna and Sea Bass Crevice was excellent, peach crepes, fried shrimp platter we got pool side was awesome, but not on the menu. The buffet was a disappointment , Nice fruit bar but I was disappointed in the lack of variety, and little local produce. Lots of cantaloupe, honey dew, watermelon, etc. average fare. They do have an omelet bar that is good. Dinner or lunch at the buffet was average food, like you might find at a U.S. cafeteria. The Mexican restaurant was good, interesting menu, and do try the Crickets. Meat is not of the quality we are used to in the U.S., but flavorful. Usually over cooked and a bit dry even when requesting medium rate. . Fish was wonderful, but not on the menu. Menus are very lacking, the best food available is not on a menu, its like hide and seek, but takes a few days to learn the ropes/ Desserts were a big disappointment. Very pretty but lacked flavor and often an odd consistency in cakes. The pastry shop has good coffee, but no pastry to speak of. Some little confections but again that spongy texture. No muffins, or croissants.And it does not open until 3 pm. Location: Not a good beach to swim off of, they have a lot of debris from the mangroves, they water is very dark brown. They work endlessly to keep the beach area clean, and have wonderful beds to nap on. A big plus is access to the rivers flowing from the cenotes. You can kayak up the rivers to a cenote, or walk over a bridge to a lovey platform with hammocks and enjoy the ocean breeze. Although they are a lovely park they have claimed less than 20 percent of the actual property, so your excursions are short and limited. The Jaguar Tour is great and a wonderful introduction to the area. However there are many resorts in the area that offer far more interaction with nature than Tres Rios can at this stage. Over all? They want to be a 5 star and in some ways they are. Then fall very short of it on food, providing information to guests, entertainment, and some conveniences. For example there is only one area to get towels for the pools. They have the Hacienda Grill by the first pool but nothing including bathrooms by the other pool There is an area coming off the beach to shower the sand off, but no bathhouse to change in. Waiters have to go back and forth a very long way to bring food and drinks. Drinks tend to melt very fast, usually before you get them. If you don't drink alcohol they offer limited choices for refreshment. I know they had some great fruit drinks but it was difficult to find out what they had unless you had the right waitress or waiter. Concerns or complaints: Watch out for head concierge, run for your life. She will batter you daily to sign up for the \"tour\" which is a sales presentation. If you do not comply she will do her best to make you feel threatened, you are not welcome to come back, you are not allowed to use the services such as the shuttle or tours without charge. We found her attitude unacceptable and threatening. I do not believe this is the attitude of the resort, they are a separate entity, I hope. The owners of the Hacienda need to reel them in before they run off more people. Complaints are common about the sales pressure, other guests shared their horror stories. It took us a few days (wasted) to find out our all inclusive fee did in fact include these services. Would I go back? I'm not sure, there a so many resorts to chose from in that area that offer the same cenote experience with out the negative side.

I will take one star away however for a couple of things that can be improved upon. There were some of their \"concierge\" staff that did not have good information on their own tours (for example the difference between the tigrillo tour and the jaguar tour was not explained well to us, even after repeated inquiries). My peeve during the stay though was the shabbiness of their on-premise car rental operation. They were friendly enough, but beyond that I am hard pressed to find good things to write about them. They were clueless about nearby attractions and were not much help at all. The car we rented from them was a pretty shabbily put together car that had markings both of Dodge and Hyundai, almost as if they assembled it from spare parts in somebody's garage. It also turned out to have a whole army of ants nestled in the back seat buckle holders and half way through our one-day trip, they swarmed out and we had to pull off the road and spend 30 minutes trying to get rid of as many of them as possible. I even took photos and a video of them. When we went back however, they treated us very poorly, and instead concentrated on 5 gallons of gas that we were \"low on\". In any other situation with some semblance of good customer service, I would have expected them to apologize to me and waive any \"low gas\" charges, especially because the gas station near the resort had closed for the night when we were coming back. Instead, they treated us like we were lying about the ants and trying to get those 5 gallons of gas free. They went and inspected the car and came back and said \"we don't see any ants in there\". Well of course they didn't see any critters - we had spent the time getting rid of them!

I was concerned about some of the reviews that I had previously read. My concerns were all allayed upon my arrival to HTR. I will start with the concierge desk. We were greeted by Hector who was helpful, informative and wonderful. Eric also was of great assistance. Thank you to both of these gentlemen and the other staff who are so gracious and helpful. Special thanks to Francisco who assisted me on one evening of my stay when I really needed some additional help. His kindness will not be long forgotten. He went above and beyond the call of duty. Truly, he was a gentleman. There were so many wonderful staff at this resort, that it was impossible for me to get all of their names. Customer service, customer service, customer service. Tres Rios has this in platinum. The food and beverage staff were wonderful. EVERY single meal was excellent. From the buffet, to room service, to the Mexican restaurant and the pizzaria. They were all noteworthy. The service was beyond reproach, the food beautifully presented and above all delicious to the palate. We enjoyed a private dinner twice while at Tres Rios. Once was a romantic dinner set beachside with a private Mariachi Band. It was both beautiful and romantic. The second dinner was provided by Chef Oscar due to a scheduling snafu. It was also fabulous and was held in the Mexican Restaurant. Chef Oscar definitely knows what he is doing...and he does it well. His staff are the hardest working, kindest and friendliest staff that I have met in the whole Caribbean..and I travel frequently. Special thanks to the following Food and Beverage Staff: Angel, Samuel (what a hard working man!) , Elba, Gregorio...these people were absolutely unbelievable. There were many others who also served us with excellence. Alas, I did not get everyone's names. However, Chef Oscar is a definite asset at Tres Rios and I hope that they keep him happy as his talent is definitely noticed and appreciated. The housekeeping staff were equally excellent. Aleesa decorated our room with such flair and natural talent. Thank you again! Our room was always spotless and we never had to request anything additional. We enjoyed a couples massage at the Spa, and were equally relaxed and refreshed. This had come after our Jaquar tour down one of Tres Rios rivers, whereby we swam in a cenote, visited the nursery and kayaked both up and down the river under the guidance of our patient and informative guide ( I am sorry, but I forgot his name, however he was wonderful). The beach water is brown colored from the mangroves as stated in other reviews, however the pools and the pool service were so beautiful that one couldn't complain. Besides, the hotel is working on removal of the mangrove roots which remained after Hurricane Wilma and are leaking dye into the water...and furthermore...it is a new resort which is very concerned about the environment, so these issues demand time and patience. The resort itself is beautiful. The grounds are impeccably manicured and presented in a subtle and beautiful manner. Even the valets were friendly and informative. Jorge was helpful to us on several occassions. I don't know what else to say about this resort. It is beautiful. The food is great. The service is unbelievable. I will return to Tres Rios hopefully sooner than later. We met some wonderful people, both guests and staff at this resort and had an absolutely fabulous time.

We like to visit and experience different AIs and have our own opions regarding this resort: Pro: Clean rooms, comfortable beds. Resor itself very clean and spotless. Unlike other AI resorts, had tons of help during all hours. Loved all the pool side staff who was always ready to help you with moving umbrellas, drinks, etc. unlike other AI who does not staff them adequately. Food: Unlike other large AIs, the variety is limited but what they do have is very good. Oscar, the executive chef of the resort: had his Chef's table dinner and it was outstanding. Wife and I are NYC food snobs at heart (own multiple restaurants in NYC) and thoroughly enjoyed Chef Oscar's tasting menu. Highly recommended. It would cost you probably more than $120. pp without the wine and for cost of bottle of wine, you can enjoy his delightful menu presented with style and flair. HIs tasting menu is worth the visit. Con: Not enough activity to keep you busy. Wish they had aerobic exercise each morning and afternoon in the pool to work off all the food. They need more comfortable pool chairs. They should provide at least one pen for the room with a writing stationary. Beach; not swimmable due to three rivers flowing into it and bringing down all the decayed vegetation with the flow especially after a heavy rainfall. Just this fact does not rate 5 star rating. Pool or beach towels: One towel per customer is not enough. Resort should look into changing this policy. Summary: if you like the beach and ocean swimming, this is not for you. Pool, yes. Food is very acceptable not limited in variety. Need to schedule more activities. Gets boring real quick. Surrounding mangrove jungle is conducive to insects especially mosquitoes in the evening. The resort's ecological mission statement is to be lauded but it can be a turnoff to the guests who do not really care for its mission and just want to be pampered in their vacation.

Cab drivers will take you to good beaches, towns, sites and fantastic activity centres. Fraction of the cost of organised trips booked with an agent. There's load of things to do, but at a cost. The best bits - very beautiful, spacious rooms (we had a 2 bedroom suite with sea views and a roof top jacuzzi). - lovely, friendly, attentive day-to-day staff who really want your stay to be special (cleaners, waiting staff, reception desk, activity hosts) - beautiful, uncrowded pools - very well maintained grounds - very clean - range of places to eat - we like Hacienda Grill and Italian best of all The not so good bits - food is beautifully presented but the menus don't change, so it does get monotonous. - with exception of canned dosxx larger, alcoholic drinks very watered down! - very inflated prices, and impossible to get value from AI ( which is not quite AI), especially if you leave the site for day trips. Horrendous prices for trips, in the shop and beauty salon - always empty as a result. Chef's table sounded fantastic but you have to buy a bottle of wine for 2 people - even if children - and cheapest bottle $80 for plonk! - nothing to do and advertised activities don't happen apart from beach volley ball twice daily, if enough people want to play. Cycle trip, cenote swim, canoes on site - very nice but can only be done as booked 1 hour sessions with same spiel each time. Souless evenings - most people eat in half full restaurants then watch dvds in their rooms. - Can't go anywhere without transport - hotel is on a highway, 35 minutes from nearest town. Hotel does 3 free daily shuttles for 13 passengers, which has to be booked at least a day in advance. Last return journey 5pm! - terrible beach - we felt controlled - you constantly have to give your room number to eat, go out in a taxi, return in a taxi...felt like hotel california \"you can check out anytime you like but you can never leave\". Lots of can't do's which staff manage through passive aggression - rude management and concierge staff who make false promises, then hide. - timeshare hard sell - awful experience, avoid at all costs.

We had a great time. It's slated to be a 5 star property, but I'd give it a solid 4 stars right now. It was wonderful, but could stand some improvements. Pros: incredible food in all restaurants Breakfast staff was incredible Location is ideal, close to playa del carmen Lots of activities to do straight on-site with very few limitations Cons: Service stellar by some, nonexistant by others. Poor drinks made by most bartenders Mosquitos, Moths, Other Bugs and creepy crawlies ROOMS We were first given a room with two queen beds, a shower that refused to train, and a water stained couch. We asked for a room with one king bed, and in 2 days our request was granted. My cousin, however, who stayed for a few days during our stay, received a king bed, and a jacuzzi on her balcony. The bathroom is beautiful and well appointed. The toilet is in a separate room from the sink and shower. The shower itself is spacious and has a glass door instead of a gross curtain. The room is very spacious with lots of areas to put your belongings. There is a fully stocked mini bar and fridge, as well as a coffee maker and teas. The beds are quite comfortable and the pillow menu is great for getting the type of pillow that would help you get the best night's sleep possible. The balcony has a table and two chairs, and is just big enough, not large and expansive though. ACTIVITIES We are adventurous and always rent a car and do activities independently outside of our resorts, but the great thing about Tres Rios is, if you don't want to leave the resort, you truly do not have to. There are a lot of on-site activities to be had. Snorkeling, Sailing, Kayaking, Swimming, in the cenotes and the rivers is right on site, and has no additional fee. All equipment is provided if you do not have your own. There are also tastings, and how-to type shows. You will not be bored here. As others have stated, the beach itself is not good water-wise, but the sand is cleaned and the beach beds are always clean and somehow were always dry! The cenote that feeds into the beach has 2 very clear areas for you to swim in if you prefer that to the pool. The pools were clean and not overcrowded which was nice. We always found a nice seat and often found a couch available. FOOD As all other reviews have stated the food here is incredible. Excellent! We are foodies and can be critical at times, but we had no food complaints at Hacienda Tres Rios. There is no wait at any of the restaurants or the buffet. There is excellent service in all restaurants and lots of variety. The buffets always had very hot hot food and very cold cold food, and were constantly being replenished. Dinner service at the restaurants could be a tiny bit slow at times, but the restaurants were always filled to capacity so it's to be understood and expected. What I really appreciated was that my random food requests, and picky little changes were honored with ease. It made my day. GROUNDS The grounds here are fabulous. Very beautiful and well appointed. The only negative to me was the amount of bugs, but it's to be expected on a natural reserve type area. The walks were beautiful, the pathways so well designed. The area is easily walkable and always something pretty to look at. The place is practically spotless. SERVICE From some staff we received 5 star service, from others, 2 star. No one was ever rude or ignored us, but some just seemed a bit frazzled or stressed. Most staff members were great and accommodating. Our requests were granted quickly. Service around the pool was fast, my annoying food requests were granted with no problem. We tip for good service and are unsure if we continued getting great service because we tipped or if the service would be the same had we not. We DID do the timeshare presentation. In return we got a $100 gift card, a sunset lobster dinner for 2 outside with a private waiter, and an hour long couples massage with champagne hot tub time after the massage. It was worth 2 hours of our time. The total price of that was about $500+ We just said no no no all the way through and got lovely gifts for our time.

Our stay at this incredible resort was August 12-19. We had a good flight down and our Cancun Transfer VIP driver was waiting with cold drinks in the vehicle for our 45 min. ride to the resort. Turning into the resort off the highway and clearing security, you immediately notice the extensive work that has been done to maintain the eco-friendly environment with construction of the long road back to the resort complex. We were greeted by the bellman, our luggage taken and escorted into the beautiful large lobby for registration. We had the pleasure of meeting with our receptionist Vanessa; she has the most beautiful smile that never seems to leave her face. Our assigned room was not ready and she suggested that we go grab a drink and some lunch and check back later. On our return to the desk the room wasn\u2019t ready yet but we meant Anim our concierge; she went over everything about the resort explaining the in\u2019s and out\u2019s very well. After receiving our room keys and towel cards (more on that later) we headed off to our Ceiba Junior Suite ocean-view room 1315. The resort room numbering system is 1st. # is building, 2nd is floor and 3rd is room. Although there are four stories the ground level is called PB, then 1 -2 &3 floors, so 3rd floor is actually the top floor. The room was fabulous, great view, well appointed and comfortable. After getting settled and reading the resort book, we realized that there was no resort map to show the locations of anything, restaurants, bars, etc. I mentioned this on Facebook and magically a resort map appeared in our room the next day. Including a map in the resort book would be a great help to the guests. Tired from our long day we ordered room service which was delivered promptly with a follow-up call to check on the service; nice touch. The beds are very comfortable so sleep was restful. We did experience a problem with our AC unit flooding the floor on nights 2&3 so we were moved to a Ceiba Junior Suite Jacuzzi. This is the same room only it has a Jacuzzi on the balcony. Thank you to Vanessa and her supervisor (sorry I can\u2019t remember his name) for the seamless move to our new room. They arranged to have the bellman transfer everything from one room to the other plus sent a beautiful fresh fruit-plate for our trouble. We spent most of our time at the \u201cRelax\u201d pool; there was never an issue with lounge chairs or shade umbrellas. This is where we meant Imelda, our server that took very good care of us our entire trip. She was always there to bring drinks, water or food and worked tirelessly throughout the day. There is also a larger \u201cActivity\u201d pool nearer the beach where different activity\u2019s happened throughout the day. There is only one location to get towels and you are allowed only one per person. There is a policy that if you don\u2019t return the towels you will be charged $80.00 for the loss. This is not a one star resort and personally I find the whole towel card and policy thing offensive. On our first day at the pool we noticed Chef Oscar strolling through the resort checking on each of the restaurants and staff he over-sees; he does this daily and multiple times. This man seems to be everywhere and takes time to be personal with the resorts guests too. I applaud his work and team from service, food prep and presentation all phases are outstanding! We had the pleasure meeting him one night at the Martini Terrace and dining at all of his theme restaurants, truly enjoying them all. They are like dining at an Iron Chef\u2019s table, ingenious blends of ingredients and flavors! Don\u2019t forget to try the deserts!!!! The grounds at this resort a beautiful, everything is green with blooming flowers throughout and all well maintained. The beach itself is very nice with plenty of beach-beds and lounges; the water, not so much! We hear that in time the cloudiness will clear. Our trip could not have been better and we encourage all to give this well organized and beautiful resort consideration. Please remember to tip your servers, they really deserve it.

Bali beds were semi shaded in the afternoon which was fantastic. Pool: adults only area had lots of children by the tail end of the day, appeared child free most of the time. Plenty of chairs and umbrellas available. Meeting space: clean new area with ability to do several configurations and set ups, great for a large Corp or incentive meeting. Separate from hotel but close enough that you can still run back to your room or for a bite to eat. Food: lunch at the buffet was good, dinner not so good. Pizza was ok, cheese had a different flavor than US pizza. Lots of luck with room service, made up our own dishes and they were delivered with a smile and tasted great. Overall very clean and spacious rooms. Ability to have king bed suite tied to a two bedded queen room, great for a family or large group traveling together. No pool bar which was disappointing. No real bar to meet friends or your group for an evening cocktail, there is a game room with a bar attached but didn't go out in the evening to se the scene there. Recommended for families looking to introduce green concepts to their children, water conservation, recycling, flora and fauna nursery and Eco park within the resort. Would not recommend to couples or groups looking for nightlife.", "Date": "August 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Matamoros, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cWondeful place\u201d", "Author": "CarolinaReens", "ReviewID": "UR74889314", "Content": "I recently stayed at Hacienda Tres Rios in PLaya del Carmen.

One day my husband went fishing and the chef cooked the red snapper that he caught and it was so amazing! The shows at night were my son's favorite part. One night they had a wonderful circus in the theatre. The other nights were great shows out by the pool. The only complaint i heard was about the beach(brown water). The beach right outside the hotel is not great b/c of recent storms, but you can walk just a bit up to the right to find clear water. To the left is nice cold water from where the cenotes dump into the ocean. It wasn't a big deal to us. Do not miss the Jaguar tour!

For the purposes of transparency, I will disclose that we are owners of this time-share resort. However, our experience with the time-share presentation was not heavy-handed, nor was it uncomfortable in any way. The resort sold itself. For those who complain about the presentations, I would suggest that perhaps they should not have attended the presentation in the first place. If you can't afford to purchase, then please don't waste the time of the salespeople to get your free tickets to area attractions. Pros: 1. The grounds are immaculate. It makes relaxing so much easier when the entire resort is bright and clean. 2. The green building is a nice change. The resort captures rain water on the roof for use on the grounds. It also has a desalinazation plant to use ocean water for the grounds, rather than using drinking water. It was nice to see the trash receptacles have two sides, one side for trash, and one side for compostable products. 3. The nightly shows were well-done and tasteful. Our entire family enjoyed the Caribbean beach party, and the Mayan show was great. My husband and I enjoyed kareoke night as well. 4. Although the spa was a little small, compared to other resorts of the same level, the services were dreamy. The resort is currently in the process of building a 3000 sq. ft. new spa facility, so this will be a nice addition. 5. On-site cenotes, kayaks, snorkeling was fun and adventurous. 6. free wireless access in our suite 7. The service was very friendly. I was sad to see that most who were vacationing did not tip their servers. Just because this is an all-inclusive resort does not mean that you should not tip those who bring your food and drinks! My husband and I made sure to tip on all services, and we were well taken care of. 8. location. The resort is about a 15 minute ride to 5th Avenue- the major retail and restaurant strip in Playa del Carmen. Neutral: 1. The cuisine was hit or miss at this resort. The Pizzaria near the pool was amazing. The fire-burning brick oven made the best crust ever! The poolside grill was very good also. The grilled shrimp were huge and cooked perfectly. My children enjoyed the self-serve ice cream poolside and the pastry shop greatly, especially the chocolate fountain with fresh strawberries daily. The asian fusion grill was probably my favorite, followed by the Italian and the Mexican restaurants, which were both tasty. The servers were very knowledgeable regarding the menu. The room service menu, although limited in choices, had tasty options as well. The only food that I thought was lacking was the daily breakfast buffet. The items on the menu never changed, thus by day seven, breakfast was getting really boring. We never ate the lunch buffet, but we heard the lunch buffet was similar to breakfast... same thing every day. Cons: 1. Beach, or lack thereof. The beach area is nice if you want to lounge in the covered cabanas with a good book. However, if you want to get in the water, this is NOT the place. The beaches were very poor compared to others I have been to in the area. However, we were able to take the shuttle to the sister resort about 20 minutes away (Fisherman's Village), and that resort had a breathtaking beach. We were also able to take advantage of their all-incusive with our visit.

Helen helped us arrange dinner with the Chef, reservations for the Italian restaraunt and told us all about the activities available to us during the week. After enjoying our drinks, we had a snack in the Mexican restaurant and the soup and fish were very tasty. Our rooms were so comfortable, the bed was great, the balcony view was relaxing, the bathroom spacious and the in room safe comforting. I really enjoyed the coolness of the floors and in the morning the thickness of the curtians. While Oscar was on vacation, our meal with the Chef was wonderfully handled by Martin and he truly made the meal a trip highlight. We enjoyed the Italian restaurant so much we went twice, the meal was wonderful and the wine selected to pair with the meal was so good!! Our only comment that is not fully positive was the lack of an adult area in the pool area - we would select an area to spend the day away from the children and while none were at the chairs anywhere near us, they seemed to congregate in our area for marco polo, I love kids, but not when dropping the kind of coin it takes to stay at a place as nice as the HTR and anticipating nothing more than a relaxing time at poolside, designate a kids area and enforce it, no one should mind. The beach beds are fantastic for a mid-day nap and while the water was not much to see (Hurricane Alex had just skirted the area), the sound of the water lapping on the beach looks wonderful when your eyes are closed drifting off for a nap. Snorkel the cenote on the Jaguar tour, it is wonderful, the others, not so much (red mangrove water is not that clear).

With this place, I've concluded that your experience will be dictated by what your expectations are. With this review, I will try to point out who is likely to enjoy (or not enjoy) this resort, because I definitely think some will love this place and some won't. I happen to fall somewhere in the middle. First, the positivies. The grounds and buildings are spectacular! Everything was clean and \"easy on the eyes.\" The rooms were spacious, had large showers, and our room had a nice hot tub on the balcony. The pools were also very nice and clean, though it did feel a little crowded at times, but not too bad. The \"common areas,\" like the lobby, entrance, etc. were very well-done, too. It was also very easy to get around the resort--the layout was designed well. The free excursions were a lot of fun, too. Swimming in the cenotes, kayaking, biking, etc. were well worth the time. Now, the \"neutrals.\" The food was hit or miss. I thought the Italian restaurant was very good, as was the Caribbean Night buffet by the beach. The Parisian cafe was a nice treat. The breakfast buffet was hit or miss and the Asian and Mexican restaurants were below average. The grill by the pool was decent and the pizza oven was very good. As you can see, I'm all over the board on the quality of the food. However, in reading others' reviews, I feel like this is a pretty accurate description. The service was also average. At times, it was very good, but when a waiter loses your order ticket for a pizza and you have to wait two hours to get your lunch, that was a bit of a disappointment. Also disappointing was the fact that there was no steakhouse. Being a \"meat and potatoes\" person, I was disappointed in that. In fact, I actually lost weight on this trip! The negatives. By far the biggest negative of this resort is the beach. Very big disappointment. We found out why, though, on one of the excursions. The mangrove trees in the area release a reddish-brown \"ink\" into the water as a defense mechanism against predators. As one person in my group said, it's like looking at chocolate milk wash onto shore. So, if you want crystal clear blue water to swim in, do not come to this resort. I had heard from another guest (and have read in these reviews) that there was a shuttle that would take you to one of their sister resorts in Playa del Carmen, where the beaches were a lot nicer. When I asked someone at the concierge desk, they said that was only for people who were interested in taking the \"timeshare tour.\" So much for that. Another big disappointment was the spa/gym area. They were basically in retrofitted guest rooms. It was very odd. In summary, the following people will probably really like this resort: --People who mostly want to lounge by the pool (and not the beach) while on-site. --Those who want to explore nature nearby. --Those who like a more laid-back, quiet atmosphere (i.e. not a lot of loud music and drunks carousing around in the middle of the night like at other resorts I've been to) --Those who like a more compact layout (i.e. not having to walk a mile to get from Point A to Point B). Those who may be disappointed: --People who want to have a beautiful beach on-site. --Those who like to use spa/gym facilities. --Those who want a lot of nightlife on-site. --Those who are \"picky\" eaters. Would I recommend this place? I'll go with a tentative \"yes.\" But like I've said, it really depends on what you're looking for.

What can I say? This resort blew us away! First off, I have posted on TA for many years and base my reviews on reality, humility, a bit of humor, and with the thought of helping my fellow travelers without a cookie-cutter review. We also use Trip Advisor extensively before booking our yearly travel plans as well. My family and I (my spouse of Mexican American heritage and my two daughters 17, 21) and my brother in law, wife, and two children, spent 11 days 10 nights at the Hacienda Tres Rios resort from June 2nd to June 12th. We purposefully travel the first week of June to eclipse the pending hurricane season, the relatively sparse occupancy, and the resorts are a bit more affordable. We usually stay in mega-resorts such as Iberostar, RIU, Barcelo, Bahia Principe, and many others in Cancun and Riviera Maya which we thoroughly enjoy. We also have been to Ixtapa, Cabo San Lucas, and twice to Puerto Vallarta. Outside of Mexico we have been to Jamaica and Dominican Republic. I realize that each traveler's experience is unique and what is important to us may not be to others and vice versa. However, there are common experiences and expectations that we share by choosing the same resort. I will try not to duplicate other traveler's reviews, but instead post our experience to TA readers. Also, having realistic expectations that- just like home- inconveniences and small problems do occur, do not detract from our overall experience. A quick thank you to the resort for responding to complaints on TA and also for its Facebook page in which I have posted during and after my trip. We booked our package through Coupons.com. which offered a great price on HTR through Travelocity. I normally book direct hotels and flights, Apple or Funjet vacations. We are not Eco people and this did not enter into our decision though we were very impressed by the dedication to replenishing the mangroves throughout the Riviera Maya after hurricane Wilma. I will relate a unique experience relating to the airline- only as a warning to purchase travel insurance (I almost never do, but did this year). We flew American Airlines into Miami from Chicago and connected to Cancun via Mexicana. Upon arrival at Cancun airport, our luggage was missing. We were told it was not on the flight. After filling out a lost baggage claim with Mexicana, although leery about leaving, we had no choice but to head to our hotel. I called Travelocity as I purchased insurance to start a delayed baggage claim. I was told our bags would be tracked and may not arrive until the following day and to purchase incidentals we needed. So, the next day we needed toiletries and swimsuits (we usually pack on carry on, but did not this time). We took a cab to Wal-Mart in PDC so we could start our vacation. A couple of hours later and we were at the pool. As it panned out, the luggage did arrive later that afternoon. Problem was that our luggage had been rifled through and items stolen- cologne/perfume, iPod speakers, hair care products and accessories, and costume jewelry. After the initial shock and anger, I called and added lost/stolen to my claim. Again I relate this experience (1st time this has happened to us) to help others. Moral of the story? Insist on finding your baggage at Cancun airport as it turns out it made if from Miami after all. We got scammed. Now, to the fun! This resort is stunningly beautiful in its architecture, layout, and impeccable maintenance. With only 270 current rooms, I consider this a boutique hotel. Upon arrival we were greeted with the eco welcome drink and friendly people at the desk. We were given adjoining rooms with a partial ocean view room even though I only paid for garden view. I purposely book the least expensive room since we only use to sleep and shower. We were assigned a concierge who gave us our activity sheet and timeshare proposal. We said we would think about it but never committed and only receive one follow up phone call. The resort is listening to concerns and complaints from guests about the high pressure initial timeshare push. We talked to others whom attended the supposed 90 minute meeting that lasted 3 hours and another said 6 hours. The list of gifts showered upon you have strings attached; such as transportation to tours is not included, and in one case we were told that unless you purchase a timeshare, you don\u2019t receive all the items listed. To each his own if you want to endure the gauntlet for a few trinkets. Over the years I have resisted and refrained from the stress of these high pressure sales tactics. Of note, we were so impressed with this resort that of all 12 times I have visited Mexico, I would consider future ownership in this complex- which is saying allot as we seek variety when traveling and enjoy different resorts. It is far and away the best service and complete experience we have ever had, bar none. HTR is equal to the best Mexican resort we have stayed at- The Westin Regina in Cabo San Lucas. But, I will not consider ownership until the resort expands or builds a lobby bar for adults to congregate. Currently, only the sports bar is available even though there is a 6 seat bar on the opposite side of the sports bar wall. But that is not staffed and there is no ambience to it at all. The resort also needs a disco as an alternative to the sports bar. Also, a permanent beach or pool bar will need to be installed. I'm ok with no swim up bar as it mostly attracts people whom have no stop sign. However, that being said the wait staff will need to be increased to handle poolside service. Others have posted that a bathroom is needed closer to the beach and I concur. The rooms are modern, clean, large, and the beds are the best I have slept on in 12 years of going to Mexico. I ordered from the pillow menu on the ICE machine and they were promptly delivered. The shower is big enough for two as others have stated. I emailed the resort months in advance to let them know we were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary and in our room was a bottle of wine, fresh fruit, and cheese & crackers on our table. Other posters related stories of the wristbands. Since we did not have wristbands even though we paid for the AI, one day I asked at reception when I saw several different colored bands on the counter. I was told that only the timeshare guests wear them and the colors represent various meal plans, AI, and children's bands. I never noticed a service standard better or worse if you had a band on or not. If you think people from other hotels can sneak onto the HTR property through the beach area, guess again. The hotel know the \"tells\" of these crashers- they ask allot of questions, ask where things are, always seem to be watching out for security or management, and look lost. I did see people from other resorts on the HTR beach property on the other side of the river taking pics and swimming, but not on the hotel grounds. The first week we were there the resort was only 30% full, but near 80% when we left. I understand previous posters who mentioned varying levels of service based on occupancy. This is unavoidable but even at 80% the staff increased their sense of urgency to maintain a superior level of service. But you can increase your frequency of service visits to your pool or beach seats by building a rapport with one or several of the servers and tipping (but not necessary). The hotel pools tips based on occupancy from the AI price paid, but minimum wage is only $4 a day regardless of hours worked (sometimes 6am to 4am). The servers obviously make a higher wage and can make $50-100 a day in tips. We always get to know as many of the staff as possible: servers, bartenders, managers, desk personnel, activity people, and even the old man who is in charge of the workers who dredge the ocean of mud. I know that tipping is part of the all-inclusive package we purchased, but individual outstanding service deserves reward. We tipped $3-4 at breakfast and lunch, and $5-10 at dinner. We also tipped our pool server $10 for the afternoon. The restaurants were better than we expected though we are not big fans of gourmet plating. Give me a fat steak, baked potato (that we didn\u2019t find) and some sides and I am good! That said, we often ordered off the menu such as flautas and tostadas at the grill for lunch, I created my own calzone at the pizza pit- very good pizzas as well. The buffet had plenty of variety for us and here is a secret: since the resort is in the \"yes\" business, I asked for the menu to the Italian while at the buffet and ordered some pasta that I had eaten there prior and it was served with a smile on the same plates used in the Italian. Can't beat that for service! We enjoyed the Italian and the Mexican- did not like the cricket appetizer though! The mariachi at the Mexican were very entertaining and interacted with the patrons along with the decor and indigenous artist paintings on the wall and a great view of the resort from its second floor window made for a wonderful dinner. Again we ordered off the menu to our palate. We did not partake in the chef's table as the ambience of a kitchen didn't appeal to us. The after dinner shows were done well with outside talent being brought in for the fire show, the welcome night, Mayan show, and others. We have seen many variations of these over the years and are probably spoiled but they were a nice addition along with casino night. But you have only once choice for Monday: The Milissa show. The 24 hour Milissa channel (29) showcases a loop of videos for the Monday show. Unfortunately, the buffet show I must say was disappointing. The show was sparsely attended and the buffet and Hacienda Grill restaurants are closed which forces you purposefully to the Milissa buffet to increase attendance. I have seen quality shows in the past 15 years, and though I was hoping, this was not one of them. We felt embarrassed for her and the dancers were out of sync- then had to work the crowd afterword peddling her CD. We confirmed what others have stated that Milissa is not somebody famous in Mexico as we have not heard of her. She is related resort ownership. The hotel will need to upgrade the offering and also should have all restaurants open and let the patrons choose their dinner preference. The onsite activities we enjoyed were the jungle tour that ended in swimming/snorkeling in a cenote and kayaking from the cenote through the mangrove to the ocean and back. We enjoyed this so much that later in our vacation we went to the beach where the ocean meets the river. There you can take the kayak up the river and swim in the cenote at your leisure. This was great- we spent two hours on our own doing this. We also did the bicycle tour which was fun, informative, and we were able to swim in another cenote surrounded by thick mangrove. The water temp in this cenote was warmer than the one in the jungle tour. We skipped the sensory tour as we are not into being blindfolded, and having to sense different smells. To each his own, I guess. I did for the first time let my two daughters parasail- down by the Ocean by H10 resort. Though not sanctioned by any hotel and without recourse if anything should go wrong, I relented. First, I asked one of the head lifeguards at our hotel what a fair price was before I bargained with them. He stated 2 people for 15 minutes for $100 US dollars. When I asked the beachcombers how much they wanted they stated $130. I purposely only brought $100 and stated that I had $1200 pesos cash and they wanted $110. I walked away. Then the \"manager\" of the hut raced over to me and I waved my pesos and he accepted. Needless to say my kids had a blast. The beach itself is fine as others have said. But if you want to know when the water will clear, talk to the old man who oversees the dredging. We spent some time talking to him and he states that in about a year it will clear up. Hurricane Wilma devastated that area and the mangroves and rivers are still recovering (fully in 25 years). However, with the daily dredging of mud- though it seems unending- will clear up and the Caribbean Sea of layers of blue will return. He also said that when you swim in the cenote or river, don\u2019t shower it off right away. He said that the minerals in the water were good for the skin. The pools were outstanding, saltwater, and were rarely crowded and cleaned daily. Again, the first week we were there you could have any beach bed or papasan at the pool as late as 10 am. The second week the resort filled up more and one could still find plenty of chairs, and a bed or two at any time. No need to play the towel game here. We did charter a family photo shoot and purchased 7 of the photos for $75. A bit steep but they really did a nice job and we were very happy with the results. We were given the photos on a HTR DVD. I saved the best for last. Several TA posters have singled out their favorites- we have ours. Hector- head and shoulders above the rest at serving us at the pool. From the daily cold \"agua con limon\" when we get to the pool, to the continuous drinks, to the chocolate covered strawberries and fresh fruit delivered to our pool spot, to getting us our towels, getting us new pillows for our papasan and moving our umbrella to keep it in the shade- sometimes adding a second umbrella, to bringing us lunch menus to serving us the food, to the necklaces you bought for my wife and daughter- you are truly one of a kind. Elias at the pool and Hacienda grill bartending- another \"will do anything that you need\" and getting to know you personally- a class act. Francisco and Ambrocio at the pool- always hustling with a smile. Victor at \"Caribbean Night\" and the Milissa show (more on that later) who brought us a platter of assorted meats and fish to our table on day one, knowing that we didn\u2019t have our luggage yet and only the clothes on our backs, pouring A1 sauce on my wife's steak (who does that?)- you are truly a fine gentleman and a fantastic server. Roberto- the manager at the pool and sometimes the buffet- arranging private meals, bringing us champagne and chocolate covered strawberries to the pool with glasses to toast our 25th wedding anniversary, to giving me a copy of the Costco (my employer) Connection magazine in Spanish, and the great service and conversation- you are a manager cut from a mold that I myself follow- we create hero moments and outstanding service for our guests. Javier at the coffee shop (the best little retreat) and buffet- always a smile and offering Kahula or Bailey's for my coffee, your candid conversation (good luck to your son in medical school in Canada!)- I can't say enough about your outstanding service. So many others- Jorge that introduced us to our room, our amenities, our interactive ICE machine, and how to change our thermostat to Fahrenheit. Santiago- who cooked us our breakfast and several times brought it to our table. Gregorio- went out of his way by going to the store and buying us two jars of peanut butter for my daughters to spread on their toast- with his own money! Juan- the pool activity coordinator/DJ (whom I gave a CD of country music/beach music that he plays each morning), Cori- who took us on an exclusive bike tour, the front desk staff who handled all our requests from our ICE machine. One request that stands out was on Caribbean Night (BBQ by the beach where they encourage everyone to wear white). One hour before the start I asked for 3 white flowers for my wife and daughter's hair. Within 30 minutes there was a knock at the door with three white flowers! My wife and I celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary- 6 months early- and asked for a semi-private location at Kotori (Asian-fusion restaurant). We told our server that we were celebrating and he displayed no reaction. We mentioned it again with the same result. My wife also told him in Spanish thinking he may not have understood. Still no reaction. Well, after dessert, I gave my wife a ring and the wooden box was on the table. The manager of the restaurant that night, Gustavo, noticed the box and asked if we were celebrating something. We told him what transpired and he asked the server if he gave us the anniversary cake. He said no and Gustavo seemed embarrassed. He said he would bring one out (though we had already eaten dessert) but we were impressed by his concern. Not only did he bring out a cake, he had the servers come over and applaud, as well as telling the entire restaurant that what we were celebrating. Then several couples shouted out their length of marriages and that created a special moment. I will not name the server as his indifference didn't not spoil our celebration, but it could have been that much better if he had been into it. I must also commend Gustavo for going above and beyond to make our anniversary dinner special! Oscar Orbe- the head chef- a true rock star. When people posted that he is everywhere and must work 18 hours a day- they're not kidding. Let me tell you about our experiences with Oscar. Every time he saw us he asked how we were, how we liked everything, and if we needed anything. One day at the buffet for breakfast I asked for chorizo for my eggs. The cook went in back and got it. The next day a different cook told me no- only what was offered at the omelets station (rare indifference by a staff member). Coincidentally, Oscar came out of the kitchen and asked how everything was. I asked if he had chorizo and was told they did. When I told him that the cook said no, he immediately went to the cook and told her that when a guest asks for something, you don\u2019t say no and to get it. He was firm with her but fair and from then on chorizo was part of the omelet station. One day we saw Oscar handing out towels as people came over the bridge from the pool when it was raining to dry off as they entered the lobby. Oscar also conducted the tequila tasting and was extremely knowledgeable and we learned allot about tequila- how to pick and drink it (I thought I already did). But that\u2019s not the topper. One day my wife was remembering the TA reviews in which people stated that if the resort didn't have something you wanted to eat at any meal, they would get it or make it for you off the menu. Oscar and Samuel (probably the highest energy manager at HTR) were standing out front of the sports bar when my wife commented that she would like some authentic Mexican food (not gourmet) and she and Oscar began to talk about pozole- an authentic Mexican soup that we love. He said he would make it special for us (all 8) at the Mexican restaurant on Wednesday. We told him that we were attending Caribbean Night and could we go on another day. Oscar suggested that he serve it to us at Caribbean Night. We agreed. Well, talk about feeling like royalty. After receiving our drinks a succession of waiters promptly began this experience- that\u2019s what it was. First the bowls of condiments- oregano, limes, chopped radishes, chopped lettuce, chopped onions, and bowls of chicharones (pork skins) were placed on our banquet table. Then several chefs delivered fine ceramic square soup bowls in front of each of us and then served us the most amazing pozole that we have ever eaten. It was as good as or better than my mother-in-law's. Oscar himself oversaw the entire process as they had to bring this all the way from the restaurant to the edge of the beach. He had to plan this not knowing precisely when we would arrive and then have it fresh. He had enough for all of us to have seconds and he even told us he made some for his wife who came to the hotel to have some as well. Now that\u2019s service! It truly was an amazing experience! Later in the week I gave Oscar a Cubs hat and t-shirt as a gift and he told me that he lives in Playa Del Carmen and someday he is going to open his own restaurant and he will have a wall and display all the gifts tat guests give him. He was so genuine in his remarks and very appreciative of the gifts. Well, you have endured a lengthy review as I am never at a loss for words. Understanding once again that small inconveniences and things go wrong here, just as they do at home, this hotel will blossom into a world class resort. We keep our expectations reasonable and thoroughly enjoyed this exceptional resort. The resort is responding to feedback and in time when completed will be an amazing complex. The challenge will be to keep the intimate feel and ambience so not to become a mega resort. We will return to the Hacienda Tres Rios and will consider ownership in the future. The hardest part about leaving such a paradise is leaving behind the incredible resort staff we have met. Thank you Hacienda Tres Rios and we will see you down the road\u2026", "Date": "July 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Costa Mesa", "Title": "\u201cMotel 6 quality...5 star prices\u201d", "Author": "LKolasinski", "ReviewID": "UR69580283", "Content": "Pros: >Nice looking, clean rooms >Free WiFi >Staff was nice (there's a \"but\" later) Cons: >rooms are nice but the AC went out all the time and the toilets malfunctioned frequently. also, the bathroom doesnt have a door. i was traveling with my dad and we had to stay on our beds if either of us wanted to shower. i also found the beds to be a little uncomfortable. i always woke up with neck and back aches that i dont get at home. >Staff may be nice, but they are the least helpful people. My dad went 30 min early for the bike tour of the grounds and asked several staff members, including a concierge, where to go. They all said to wait where he was. He asked several times as time went by but they said to wait. after an hour he asked again and they said the tour left and it was his fault he wasnt on it. Also, we rented a car but ended up returning it a day early with a full tank of gas (they gave it to us with barely a quarter tank). They refused to give any type of refund for the day we didnt use. Then dad went to the ATM and no ATM anywhere nearby was working. >The food is AWFUL! The buffet has limited selections and the food is basically microwaved lean cuisines. I'm a diver so when I go on vacation i bring wetsuits, bathing suits and sandals. For the rest of the restaurants there's a dress code that dad and i hadn't packed for. I hate that. You also have to make reservations which is ridiculous for an all inclusive hotel. the room service menu has the least desirable food that i've ever seen on a menu. i ordered a veggie sandwich once and it came on soggy bread with one slice of tomato, one piece of lettuce and 2 carrot slices. really? >you cannot get any type of cash from the front desk despite the lack of working ATMs >we booked a dive with Dos Ojos dive shop. We really liked them so we called them direct the next day instead of going thru the hotel. the hotel people FLIPPED OUT because they wanted a 20% cut of what we paid the dive shop. then they kept trying to send us to another place we couldnt call direct. >there was NO info available about the grounds once we got to the hotel. we read about all the cenotes and wildlife that were apart of the grounds but when we got there youd think it didnt exist. we never saw any of it. I work with animals for a living and the wildlife was the main reason we chose this hotel. we didnt see so much as an iguana. Also, the water in the ocean is brown there. >dad and i get up early and dive all day and when we get back we crash pretty early. people party went into the night and its very loud. people were constantly going up and down the halls very loudly and they had some kind of loud party with drums outside every night that kept us up until after 10pm. it sounded like maybe it was fun if thats what you're into but it was annoying for us. >my dad is an alcoholic and has been sober for many years. he was offered a drink and asked for one with no alcohol. when he tasted the drink it tasted of alcohol. he told the bartender, but he swore up and down he put no alcohol in the drink and told my dad the contents of the drink. dad finished the drink and a few minutes later was pretty buzzed and sick and knew he had had alcohol. if you know anything about alcoholism, you know how upsetting something like that is for an alcoholic. dad was pretty devastated. he told a manager, and that manager proceeded to come to our room and check for alcohol and said that my dad drank alcohol somewhere else because the drink did not have alcohol. >i went to the spa to get a facial. it was the least expensive one at $140 (USD). Basically it was an hour long face massage with lotion. ive paid a little more than half that at \"The Spa\" at South Coast Plaza in California (a VERY nice spa) and gotten the works. I could go on. Pretty much this was the worst hotel we've ever stayed at. The rest of the trip was good...Chichen Itza, Cenote Diving, Whale Shark Diving...all great.

We were treated like royalty and everything from the room to the food was first class. The facility was gorgeous and immaculate. Everyone from the wait staff to the executive chef picked up glasses and tidied anything that was out of place. This showed us how proud they were to be working there and that they cared that the image was untarnished.The staff joyfully attended to all our needs. The staff is hard working and always have a smile on their faces. We look forward to spending many vacations at this resort with the wonderful friends we made there. We would like to acknowledge the wonderful people we met there: Maurisimo who was the first person we met from the resort went out of his way to assure we were taken care of. He provided us with expert guidance to make sure we had the best experience. Sammy was always visible and provided us with special food, drinks, and advice for selecting our incredible dinners at the restaurant Kotori. You only had to ask for him and he was right there to help. He was so available to his staff and handled everythig with ease and grace. On our first night, we met Alfonzo at the resturant Kotori. Every night we were treated to unbelievable dinners and amazing service. We looked forward each night to not only our meal but also seeing Alfonso. Alfonzo's service was the best we have ever received and he made us feel like he is very happy to serve us. We extend the same hospitality to our family and friends who visit our home and we now understand how important it is to make people feel this way. Raul took care of us every day at the pool. We enjoyed marvelous drinks and everyday he served us tasty lunches and delicious snacks. He had impeccable timing, always sensing exactly when we needed our drinks refilled. His sunny smile made every day a pleasurable experience. Shane, the activities director, made sure everyone was aware of the activites of the day. I especially enjoyed Tequila class with Chef Oscar. I will never look at Tequila the same way again. I honor it for the special drink it is and will enjoy drinking it the way Oscar taught us. Jacqueline, the Kotori hostess, and Gladys, hostess in the buffet resturant, always made you feel like they were happy to see you and made sure your table was ready and in the right spot. Jasmine and Mila , who attended to us in the spa were excellent. I enjoyed a wonderful manicure and pedicure and both of us were treated to massages that were remarkable. We also were treated very well by Jorge and Alfredo in restaurant Kotori, Rene at the towel hut, Angelica at the beach, Omar at the pool, Santiago who made our omelets very morning,and Keren at the front desk. It has been over a month since our visit to this wonderful vacation paradise and we still talk almost every day about our experience. Many times we will be at a local restaurant and say to each other we are no longer in Mexico at the Hacienda Tres Rios.

We were a little hesitant about some earlier reviews, but were blown away by everything. Not really sure where these bad reviews came from as I can't imagine anyone who has done their research not loving this place. The service in all areas of this resort is top notch!!! We don't expect a lot, and were blown away by the level of service. Check in was a breeze with no mention of the timeshare presentation. Service at all of the restaurants was phenomonal. Pool side and beach service was incredible. There were times we weren't even finished with our drinks and we all ready had a new one waiting for us. They would also bring us menus around lunch time, so we ate poolside everyday. A little side story on service, our second to last day I arrived at the bakery early hoping to find chocolate covered strawberries, which I hadn't had all week, and was so excited to find a few out. Roberto, one of the managers, was surprised that this was the first time I had them the whole week and when I returned to our room later that day, I found a platter of strawberries. Then the next day he saw us by the pool, and delivered yet another platter of strawberries. Excellent service!!!! Rooms were wonderul!!! We were in a 2 bedroom suite with a rooftop hot tub, which was a nice surprise!!! The views of the ocean, pools and jungle were amazing!!! The only thing that would have been nice to have was a microwave, but other that that no complaints. We did take advantage of some of the tours on site. We did the Jaguar tour, which included a trip to the nursery, snorkeling in a cenote and kayaking up and down one of the three rivers. It was definitely worth the 2 hours. Our group also did the bike tour, which was again amazing. It was great to ride through the jungle and see the many cenotes on property, even swam in one. The bikes definitely could use an upgrade, but they did the job. We also did the Trugrillo tour, which was snorkeling in a cenote and kayaking again in a river. Also, took advantage of the catamaran ride which was amazing!!! I was nervous about this one, but Miguel was wonderful!!! Restaurants were amazing!!! We visited all of them and would have to say the Mexican was our least favorite, not that is was bad, it just wasn't our favorite. The Asian and Italian were wonderful, but we really enjoyed the Hacienda Grill in the evenings. The only time we visited the buffet was for breakfast, and it was wonderful with a great selection. Entertainment in the evenings was very quiet. The Fire Show is a must see, in fact we watched that twice!!!! Caribbean night was also a lot of fun!!!! If you are looking for a resort with a lot of night life this isn't for you, but they do a Coco Bongo tour every night, so this might help. The pools were amazing and huge!!! We loved how they were laid out. For the most part they were very quiet, except over the weekend when a very big graduation group was at the resort. They also advertise an adult pool, but that was not enforced, but really was not a big deal. The couple of days it did get loud, we just moved down to the beach and enjoyed the loungers and beach beds. Speaking of the beach, as other reviewers have noted, the water is not the wonderful caribbean water that you would expect, but a short walk south and there is plenty. Also if you go north to the second river and float down it to the ocean, the water is amazing!!!!! We will definitely return to HTR!!! The location was great, we loved being away from town where it was quieter, but close enough for a quick ride into town for some shopping.", "Date": "June 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cWe were pampered more on this stay than anywhere I have ever visited!\u201d", "Author": "catpeddler", "ReviewID": "UR68899004", "Content": "What a wonderful fun vacation for us all.

I'm fairly confused by reviews about it being in the middle of no-where since it is located on the main highway by many other resorts. Very easy to find. I recommend taking the shuttle from cancun airports. we rented a car for a day and had no issues either. We stayed 6 nights- we booked all inclusive- We had a top floor room with a king bed and jacuzzi on the balcony with an ocean view. Beds were very soft, shower was huge, about 50 channels on the tv, also includes a dvd player. The A/C was random with a mind of its own we'd set it at 60 but the temperature hovered around 75. the computer dining system doesnt work- service was outstanding however you had to call your order it. Think of it as an electronic menu. Dont expect too many customizations though unless you can translate. also over hte phone chicken is mistaken for chips- so its better if you say \"pollo\" etc Food-all inclusive is the only way to go- otherwise you'll spend about $100 per meal. my favorite was the pool side grill/cafe- dinners were outstanding. Buffet wasnt very good esp lunch/dinner. Chinese was a joke-- the sushi was more rice than seafood. Deserts were basically ice creams in the shape of a cake- i.e tirimisu was not a fluffy cake pudding like expected but it was tasty. Strawberry cheesecake was aweful and is rasberry. the free lobster dinner was also outstanding. I chose lobster, steak and salmon trio and it was my favorite meal. Waiters/staff are more than attentive- please tip them as they work really hard and do not make much. Luz (lucy) was our favorite worker- she worked so hard often running between patrons to get food/drinks. The days she was not our attendant we had to get our own food and drink constantly which was a pain after her service. PLEASE TIP if its good service as they make peanuts per day compared to the effort. Tours- We took the snorkelling tour- it is what it is. Dont expect to see an aquarium of fish. They also require you to wear life vests so you cant dive down even if you feel the urge. one lady in our group kept asking where the fish were.. if that means much. Wine tasting was fun you get to try \"shots\" everything from white to merlots. Rainbow shots at the bar were outstanding. They dont taste very alcoholish but will sneak up on you. The beach was great sand but the water wasnt very pretty due to the mangroves. It was turquois about 100 yds out but the sand felt gross even in the clear water. I'm not sure why they having rented a large pump to pull out the gross colored mangrove residue and allow the water to be pretty. I understand the eco-ness but its slight excessive. We had a beach bed everyday except our excursion day in tulum. we rented a car and drove down spent $65 on a car $12 on gas and had a great day snorkeling in dos ojos and visiting the beautiful ruins/beaches in tulum. My biggest complaint with the influx of mexican nationals. They are far more demanding and pushy and made the \"relaxed\" feeling dissipated over the weekend. The staff was more on edge during that time too. I would suggest trying to stay not on the weekends to avoid the \"locals\" since they're just pushy and dont have courtesy to wait in line etc. Often one person was ahead then all of a sudden six others joined and had very specific demands. it was just annoying but its their culture. I recommend this place if you want to relax and feel like your at a half empty resort. It was really nice and did the trick for what it was. There was no nightlife so if you want to party all night its not for you. we were in bed before 11 every day but that tends to happen if you drink from noon-10pm and have been enjoying hte weather. Recommendations if you visit- pack koosies- we found it kept our drinks cold- otherwise ice melts quickly in the heat Straws- they arent very good at mixing and if you prefer well mixed and sipping via straw pack your own. Candy- the staff absolutely loves skittles/peanut m&ms/starbursts etc- they cannot get those things and our \"resort\" friends taught us that trick.", "Date": "June 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cWARNING..PLEASE READ THIS REVIEW BEFORE YOU GO!!!\u201d", "Author": "travel0310", "ReviewID": "UR68489292", "Content": "My husband and I went to Hacienda Tres Rios on our honeymoon through someone else's timeshare.

Simply put, we had an unbelievably relaxing vacation. We were very curious how our vacation would turnout, due to the mixed reviews that we had read. We however had very few if any complaints. We were warmly welcomed at check in, and our shuttle service (provided by the resort) had no trouble finding the place. The shuttle service however was a little disappointing, we waited about 30 minutes at the airport for our vehicle, and on the way back to the airport we had to pickup another couple from a different resort, which doubled the amount of time it should have to get to the airport. (Its typically a 30 minute drive). I believe a taxi would have been cheaper, and less time consuming. Those were about the only negative experiences we encountered. Our concierge was nice and explained everything to us, she did try to get us to go to breakfast with her and \"tour\" the premises, but we declined because we knew this involved a time share presentation, and she accepted our no thank you. She let us know if we needed anything at all to not hesitate to ask. That is where the great service started. The pools were amazing, as were the pool servers, especially Alfredo. Anyone who goes must try to find him, not that he's hard to miss, he's there pretty much daily. Anytime we needed anything he graciously granted our request whether it was a drink, pizza from the grill (which was great), chips and guacamole, you name it. Alfredo definitely gets two thumbs up!!! Room service and housekeeping were also spectacular, as were the restaurant hostesses and servers. There were plenty of activities if someone is worried about being bored, such as water polo, beach volleyball and kayaking. Also, the evening shows/events were also entertaining. The sports bar was more of a lounge, but it did the job, especially during the first game of the world cup, great atmosphere! The restaurants were good, a lot of variety, and the breakfast buffet was a good start to the day. Never really ran out of options. The beach as everyone seems to mention wasn't the greatest, but it was a beach! We spent most of our time at the pool. You can however take a free shuttle to a sister resort in Playa del Carmen where the beach is absolutely gorgeous. Overall we had a great relaxing time and cannot wait to go back!

We decided to get married and worked out details with our own personal wedding coordinator who saw to the details of obtaining the minister, flowers, and sound arrangements. (Thanks Luis!) Even though we made arrangements to get married on the beach we soon found it was way too hot to get married in the Mexican Sun even though we are from Florida. I advised Luis of my concerns the morning of the wedding and we were quickly accommodated by being offered a private room (so nicely air conditioned!) wherein we had our ceremony and dinner. We had a special visit by a mariachi band and a personal visit from the chef and staff manager. Although I had ordered the steak for all of us, I found out on the trip that one of friends had recently stopped eating red meat. My friend's request to change his meal was accommodated without question and with a smile. I also had the opportunity to visit the Spa. I received a wonderfully relaxing massage and manicure on the Big Day!! How many brides actually get to relax on their wedding day!? It was wonderful! Finally, while out of the big city, Playa Del Carmen is only 15 minutes away if you must get some nightlife in while you are there!

The property is very new and sparkling clean. The first few days of our stay they had occupancy of about 30% and the service was Outstanding.

The Mexican restaurant upstairs was far too \"haute cuisine\" for any of our group's taste. They need to improve their refrigeration capacity. The six of us routinely drank them out of cold beer. They seemed to only be able to stock it by the six-pack and then would have to run to the warehouse for more, which was lukewarm. While the pools on site are large and interesting, the ocean is unswimmable. There is a nature preserve on site for bike riding, snorkeling and kayaking, all recommended. The resort is otherwise secluded. It is impossible to get off property with out hiring a cab or signing up for an excursion. We did spend two days off site shopping and sightseeing, which was nice, but not a very good use of our all-inclusive fee. Be prepared for a hard sell on buying a time share or one of the Phase 2 beach houses. 90 minutes will easily turn into 3 hours. The staff were all extremely friendly, and eager to please.

After reading the reviews from earlier in the spring, I was a little apprehensive. However, after spending the week there, I can honestly say that if anyone stays at this resort and does not have a good time, they must be trying really hard not to have a good time! Check in went very smoothly for us. It did take about 30 mins to check in and speak with our concierge. We were escorted to our room and given instructions on how to use the computer system, thermostat, etc. There was some pressure to attend what I assume was a time share presentation. It was referred to as a \"Tour of the property,\" and we were offerred tickets to nearby attrations and other incentives to attend. We were assured that there would be no high pressure. Initially, we said we would go, but in the end, My husband and I decided we didn't want to spend any of our vacation time in a sales presentation. We called and cancelled, and we were not approached again. The rooms were wonderful! They are very spacious, the furniture is nice and the beds were so comfortable. The jacuzzi tub was a nice touch. We could not have been more pleased with the accomodations. I have seen a lot of commentary about the food. The buffet does become old after a couple of times. I am the first to admit that we do not normally eat fancy fare at all, and the items and combinations on the menu can seem a little intimidating. However, everything that we ordered was excellent. Also, the staff is very accomodating, and is willing to make special items not on the menu, if you prefer. The Hacienda Grill and the pizza place are wonderful for lunches. Also, order room service and get the Mexican breakfast sometime...yummy. The room service menu is somewhat limited, but service is prompt. Drinks may have been a little light on the alcohol, but were fine for us. We did not have intentions of going on vacation to get plastered, anyway. The tours and activities that we participated in were great. We did the Jaguar tour, and tequila tasting, which I would highly recommend. We also did the Sense of Adventure which was a little different, but okay. Definitely worth experiencing. The beach is...well, not so pretty. And initially, I was disappointed about that. However, The pools are great. There is a beautiful area to the left of the resort that has beautiful water and a couple of sweet spots for swimming. Also, the cenotes are wonderful to swim in! It was not a far walk, and they felt so refreshing! The resort has a very family friendly atmosphere. This is not a big party place. The activities in the evenings were nice, we attended a couple of them. The Fire show and the Mayan show were great. The thing that makes the resort stand out, is the staff. Everyone there seemed happy to see us all the time. Everyone was very accomodating, and they must work 16-18 hour days. Oscar, Shawn and Tony were especially friendly. I would highly recommend this resort. Also, If you are looking for something interesting to do while in the area, I would recommend The Jungle Place and Edventure Tours. They made our vacation great.

We purposely stayed outside of Cancun because we came purely for relaxation and not for nightlife. The resort itself had a small selection of nightly activities (a dance show, a fire show, karaoke, etc.), but for the most part it was pretty quiet. Since I wasn't vacationing with the expectation of being entertained every night this really didn't bother me, but if you want more of a party atmosphere then this is not the place for you. One thing I was very impressed with was how clean the rooms were. Granted, the hotel is only about a year old so everything still feels very new, but I still feel this is worth mentioning. When I travel for my job I stay almost exclusively at the Four Seasons, and I'm also a neat freak, so for the room to feel clean to me is saying a lot. Also, every room has an ocean view and a balcony. Another thing worth mentioning is the staff. I felt that every single person that worked there went out of their way to get us exactly what we wanted even if it wasn't advertised or on the menu. Not only that, but they'll remember what each person likes and make sure that it's available to them throughout the week. Speaking of this, make sure to note that telling them things ahead of time helps a lot. For example, on the all inclusive program lobster isn't necessarily on the menu, but if you tell them beforehand they'll have it ready for dinner at the restaurant of your choice. When you arrive at the hotel it's nice that they allow you to choose either all inclusive OR a la carte because a lot of all inclusives won't give you the choice. My husband and I don't drink, so we don't necessarily feel like we get our money's worth doing the all inclusive. I do have to say that if you choose a la carte they definitely hike the prices up a lot (like $45 dollars for a steak dinner), but if you eat light the rest of the day and you're not big drinkers you'll still save money. I haven't stayed at many all inclusives, but I do have to say that I thought the quality of the food was very good. It wasn't like some of these places that just throw out a huge buffet of mass-produced food. (Having said that, I'm also a person that travels without expecting other countries to bend over backwards for me. I pretty much go with what their culture and food is. You can't expect the croissants at the breakfast buffet to taste like those in Paris. I went with the mentality that I was going to eat eggs and tortillas for breakfast and it was delicious!) The menus had gourmet food which was all very good, but like I said before, you can always ask for something that's not on the menu. A quick note on the \"chef's table\" dinner: I would definitely recommend it as the food is very good and unique, but don't expect a moody, romantic atmosphere. You're literally sitting in a section of the kitchen under bright lights, surrounded by white walls and stainless steel, listening to the clanking of pots and pans. This isn't a bad thing, but just go into the experience expecting this. Also, for some reason I was under the impression that a bunch of people would all be sitting at a communal table and was pleased to arrive and find that each couple or party did get their own table. I spent almost every day out by the pools or the beach. The beach right in front of the hotel is not that nice! The reason is that there are 3 freshwater rivers that empty out into the ocean on the resort's property. This is kind of cool in itself because it's fairly rare, and you can snorkel or kayak down the rivers. However, the bad side of this is that the rivers churn up the sand where they meet the sea, so the water and beach right in front of the resort are not that enticing for swimming. If you want that postcard perfect turquoise water and white sand beach you can take the shuttle or a taxi (for about $15 one way) into Playa del Carmen, hang out at the beach for the day,and come back to the resort when you please. (I actually think you're totally missing out if you don't do that at least one time during your stay here) However, if you just want to relax or read, the beds on the beach are amazing (made up daily with fresh white covers and pillows) and I never had a problem getting one at any time of day. The waiters will serve you down on the beach or at the pool. There were two pools (one kids one with volleyball, etc. and one grown up one) that were both very clean and the perfect temperature. Most afternoons I would head over to the gym, which wasn't that big but had nice equipment (3 treadmills, 2 ellipticals, 2 bikes, and weights). It was always pretty empty so I never had trouble getting on a machine I wanted. My husband and I also both did spa treatments and were happy, although considering what workers in Mexico must make compared to workers in the states, the prices on the treatments were definitely not discounted at all. I can get a cheaper facial at the place I go to in Beverly HIlls than I could at the resort! Overall we had a wonderful time. We relaxed, ate good food, and came home with great tans!

Excellent choice if you are looking for rest and relaxation with plenty of options available for daily activities. Check in was a breeze after which you meet with a concierge agent who explains the resort and everything it has to offer. The concierge also tries to talk you into going to a time share presentation. We initially declined and we were not pressed. Our concierge then led us to our 1 Bedroom suite which was on the 4th floor (unit 4328). This was a corner unit facing the cenotes and the end of the beach (no pool view). In the unit, there was a living/dining room (with a large dining room table on which we enjoyed room service on almost daily) and a master bedroom with a master bathroom. The unit was very spacious, had 2 balconies, one overlooking the cenote/beach and the other overlooking the mangrove forest. The added surprise of this unit was that the master bedroom had a spiral staircase leading to the roof and a private Jacuzzi tub outside on the roof, very nice. This was our first experience with all-inclusive and I was a little concerned after reading reviews regarding bracelets and how we would be treated, but I expected that if we tipped as we normally would we would be okay. We came in through RCI, and had what I guess was an RCI bracelet and, although we noticed many different colored bracelets on other people and some people with no bracelet, it appeared that everyone was treated the same, regardless of tipping. The bracelet that we were given to wear unfortunately had to be worn for the entire week and is not comfortable. The service at the pool area was very good. We generally tipped in accordance with the service, which was outstanding all week and regardless of tipping, the service appeared just as good for everyone around us all week. We ate at the Mexican, Italian and Asian restaurants as well as the Hacienda grille. The wait staff was good throughout, however the food was average and only occasionally above average. The alcoholic beverages lacked alcohol so Tecate (Mexican beer, although other choices are available) is the way to go. Room service was always timely and brought us what we wanted, regardless of whether or not it was on the room service menu. The timeshare presentation: Let me start by saying that on the Saturday of our arrival, it was very windy out. We woke up the next morning and it was still windy and slightly overcast which made us think it would be a bad weather day. We decided to call the concierge and see if we could go to the presentation that morning. The two factors in deciding to attend were the weather and well over $300 in savings with gifts for attending the presentation. Although the salespeople will tell you otherwise, it definitely turns into a high pressure sales pitch. I actually thought the final offer they gave us was a really good deal, but we ended up no-ing our way out in about 3 hours. For this we ended up getting two tickets for a day trip to Xel Ha and Tulum (which I would recommend doing if you have the time), a \u00bd hour massage for the two of us and free transportation for the week to Playa del Carmen. Recommendations: I would recommend once you have settled in, take a look at the weekly activity schedule and then go to the concierge and book the activities you would like to participate in. Many of the tours fill up fast. They have a bicycle tour, snorkeling (down the cenote to the beach area) and kayaking (up and down the cenote). You can also use the equipment and do these activities on your own, but it was nice to have the activities staff guide us and give us a narrative about the resort and Mexico in general. The pool area is very nice with 2 large pools and 3 or 4 hot tubs. The beach area is okay, however, as most of these reviews will note, the water is somewhat murky and I did not see anyone swimming in the ocean in front of the resort\u2019s beach area all week. If you are looking to relax on the beach all week with blue water in front of you, this resort is probable not for you. However, you can get a good beach experience walking several hundred yards up the beach or by going to the sister resort, Fisherman\u2019s, in Playa Del Carmen. The all-inclusive extends to Fisherman\u2019s, so we did enjoy a day walking through the shops on 5th avenue in Playa Del Carmen as well as the beach, pool and all-inclusive at Fisherman\u2019s. If you are looking for nightlife and a party atmosphere, this resort is probably not for you. There are very few people out past 11 pm and only once during our stay did the sports bar have more than 10 guests after this time. However if you do stay here and happen to be in the mood to party one night, Tony from the activities staff, rounds up anyone interested in going out at night and guides them into Playa Del Carmen\u2019s bars and clubs at the end of his shift (around 10PM). The employees at this resort work hard and are very friendly and outgoing.

Tres Rios is about 30 minutes to the west of Cancun, so there is a little bit of driving that needs to be done to actually get to the resort.

Just make sure you book a rental car through the corporate website before you go down there because there are scammers all over the place that will \"give you a free rental\" if you attend their timeshare.

There is only one road out of the airport, and all you do is follow the signs to Playa Del Carmen on the 307 interstate, and about 25-35 minutes later you'll see big white letters (like 10 ft. tall) on the left that say Tres Rios-you then check in at the entrance guard shack and in you go. When you get to the resort you notice all the jungle, it was straight up Jungle Book, or Jurassic Park, it was beautiful. Then when you get to actual building the valet comes out and checks your bags with the bellboy and then takes your car and the bellboy takes your bags. We walked in and the lobby was just amazing! Thats really all you could say, just beautiful (and air conditioned extremely well). After we checked in at the desk we were introduced to our own Concierge, her name was Fer (fernanda), she was excellent. Her english was fantastic as she explained to us all of the features of the resort and then answered any questions we had. She really was great! We were then shown to our room where we met the bellboy with our bags. The room was on the 3rd and had an amazing view of the beach, pools, hotel, jungle, just anything you can imagine on a postcard could be scene from our balcony. And the room was great, it had marble and granite everywhere, absolutley beautiful. We attended a timeshare presentation and got a free trip to Chichen Itza (a must see, one of the 7 wonders) and the presentation wasn't that bad, it came with free big breakfast and tour of the grounds, plus it was pretty easy to say no to a 208,000.00 package. There are like 6 restaraunts at the resort, we like the brick oven pizza and hacienda grill the most, but as far as price goes we found that room service was the most inexspensive way to go (we opted out of the all inclusive, too pricey for us). Great food though. The staff provided excellent entertainment, there was a big welcome dinner with a mexican mariachi(?) band, there was a fire dance show, a mayan native show and a whole bunch of other great activities. The only complaint about the resort itself was the beach was not the best. The beach had great lounge stuff set up, which was great, but the water was brown and was washing a lot of black gunk up on the shore so if you wanted to swim it was better to walk down the beach about 100 yards to next resort where the water was blue and the sand was white. Still really great though. Playa Del Carmen is the closest city, about a five to ten minute drive to west, really easy with a rental car, its a smaller version of Cancun, with lots of places to eat, beautiful beaches and lots to do. A must see on the your trip is the Alux restraunt and lounge. Its on Juarez Ave. (resort staff can give you a map) but its a restraunt in a cave, the prices are actually cheaper than the resort food prices and the food is wonderful! There is a website if you google Alux, playa del carmen. Anyway, we also went to Cozumel and did snorkeling, which was great and we also went swimming in the natural pools they have at the resort, called Cenotes, all around just a beautiful area. And despite and what the negative people say, the water at this resort was safe to drink, we would fill up water bottles and keep them in our fridge, it was great and we never got sick. I would recommend this resort for sure! Also, I've read reviews that some say the resort is for older people, my wife and I are 24, no kids, and we had a blast. The resort only fills a certain number of rooms so it never seems really crowded, its great and unless you want to be in walking distance to night clubs, I would really recommend this place cause it has it all!", "Date": "May 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cI will return.\u201d", "Author": "sandlady65", "ReviewID": "UR63798986", "Content": "I visited Hacienda Tres Rios with a friend for a 3 nights stay. If not for the continuous rain, it would have been a great girls' trip! We only had seven hours of sunshine the entire time we were there and still managed to enjoy the resort and the hotel. Negatives: Front desk doesn't make American change. Concierge was not there the first afternoon we were there and the front desk couldn't find a map of the resort. Our room was missing the dust ruffle and other colorful accessories that make it not \"white\" and boring. In room coffee maker supplies were not restocked. Entertainment options very minimal when it rains--and remember it rained all but 7 hours of 3.5 days... The sports bar is central to the lobby but has no real ambience...a little too lit and a not exciting enough to draw a fun crowd. Not enough services poolside. Spa doesn't have a restroom--you have to go the gym around the corner. Internet was spotty -- they blamed it on the rain. Positives: Friendly staff. Better food than other all--inclusives I've visited. Nice pool and outdoor cafe. Spa massage choices are decent and they had good promo prices when we were there. Clean rooms. The rooms were nice and our balcony overlooking the pool was great. We could see the beach and the water. The beach seemed fairly clear of seaweed. The beach beds...! Karaoke was fun. If it hadn't rained so much I believe the resort would have had many more pluses...there are plenty of outdoor sitting areas, the nature reserve looked fantastic including the natural river which you can snorkel and/or kayak, there's a man-made river going through the resort and you can grab a canoe and paddle around, hammocks. I will absolutely consider another trip to HTR with my husband and children....I think the rain was just bad luck and the staff would have made it go away if they could have.

Pros- Very clean Great service Cons- Food is good, unfortunately the restaurants try too hard, just about everything has too many tastes, ingredients, fancy words, etc. Luckily at the mexican restaurant they will make you basic mexican food thats not on the menu, because most of the stuff on the menu was gross. What I ended up getting was awesome, steak fajitas one night and mole chicken enchilladas the next. The staff was 5 star definitely. The \"Asian\" food was terrible. One of the restaurants is a pizza stand. Make it a taco-burrito stand. I am in mexico because I want mexican food, not pizza. The whole timeshare thing, when you check in they immediately try to get you to do the time share thing, we opted out and were not pestered again because of it. The thing that sucks is I paid for the ALL INCLUSIVE! Totally annoying to speak with other people at the hotel who got free lobster dinners, free access to their sister hotel in Playa Del Carmen and all of it's amenities, and shuttles into and back from playa del carmen for free because they had TIMESHARE BRACELETS! So much for ALL INCLUSIVE! How much would it really put them out to offer this stuff to people they sell a service thats supposed to be ALL INCLUSIVE! The last place I stayed was Xpu Ha, an animal sanctuary turned hotel that is part of a chain that includes hotel giants like the Adventura and Moon Palace. It was an all inclusive that was very secluded, had great pools, great food and tons of wildlife. At hacienda tres rios I went walking everyday and kayaked two rivers and saw a total of 5 iguanas and some crabs. With Xpu Ha we got free excursions and access to all of the hotels in their chain, and all of those hotels amenities for free. Now that's ALL INCLUSIVE! If and when I return to the Yucatan Peninsula I will not roll the dice again, Xpu Ha was amazing, a very clean hotel with a very unique layout and great everything. All in all not a terrible hotel, but definitely not a 5 star. Lots of energy was put into making it a clean sterile hotel, not enough was put into giving it personality. We brought our 6 month old, she was treated awesome, got a great crib for our room and a highchair, no problem. Like I mentioned previously the staff was absolutely the best.

We've vacationed in Acapulco (one of our favorite places), Puerto Vallarta, Cabo, Manzanillo, Cancun and Riviera Maya (last year during the Swine Flu outbreak). We love to try new places and even though we loved where we stayed last year (RIU Palace Riviera Maya) we wanted to try something different. We spent a lot (and I mean A LOT) of time researching resorts in Riviera Maya and reading reviews on Trip Advisor. When we first booked our trip we did read some bad reviews, but mostly related to Time Share pressure. The majority of the reviews were very favorable. So, we booked it. Then in late March, early April we saw quite a few really bad reviews and started to get a little nervous. We booked our trip as a relaxing escape from reality....and that is exactly what we received. I have to say that our trip was excellent. We arrived at HTR around 5pm after a long day of traveling. We were greated at check-in with a smile a refreshing glass of green juice, which my husband just \"loves.\" We were quickly seated with our concierge who explained all about the restaurants, tours, etc....She mentioned the timeshare presentations and just asked that we let her know if we were interested in attending a presentation. That was it.....absolutely no pressure and we were never approached again during our entire week's stay. Our room was really nice. We had a Mangrove Suite, which overlooked the mangroves, ceynotes and a distant ocean view. It's very private on that side of the building....no other hotels, walls, or other obstacles....just nature. Not for everyone, but we enjoyed the serenity. Remember, we were on a break from reality. The beds....to die for. Very comfortable with a wide variety of pillows available. By far the best beds we've ever slept in while in Mexico, and we've stayed at some pretty pricey hotels. The bathroom was nicely appointed. The toilet had a door so you could use it in private while someone else was showering. The shower was a large walk-in shower, perfectly sized for two. I would love to have had a small bench in the shower....it would have come in handy when shaving the legs. HTR does generate their own electricity and we did have a few blackouts while there, but they were very short and uneventful. The pools were beautiful and the landscaping was too. Loved the beach beds and especially the day beds by the activities pool. Perfect for curling up and reading a book. I cannot say enough about the service....OUTSTANDING. We have never received this level of service at a hotel in Mexico before. We've always had a good experience, but the staff the HTR goes above and beyond. Kudos to our favorites, Gregorio, Carlos and Raul. Also, while we don't know his name, the gentleman that mad my husband's espresso in the coffe shop. I will say this...if you have to swim in the ocean or look out at the beautiful blue sea, HTR probably isn't for you. We did know this before we arriving, so we were not disappointed, however, I must admit that I did miss blue view. I did find a little piece of it by the ceynotes, which were a refreshing change from the pools.....literally. The pool water was warm, so when we really wanted to be refreshed we'd walk over to the cenotes for a swim. They were great. We enjoyed the food too. Having stayed an several all-inclusives I can say that I tend to get buffeted out after a week. The nice change at HTR is that you have the Grill and Pizza options for lunch.....and they'll even deliver to you at the pool or the beach. They have a nice menu, but you can order pretty much anything you want. The one day my husband ordered a ribeye steak for lunch. I ordered grilled shrimp and Gregorio also gave me a little steak to go with it....great! The pizza was also really good too. The one thing that I missed is a place to sit outdoors and listen to live music, have a drink and maybe some slow dancing before and after dinner. This would be a nice touch to add. Overall, we had a great time. We de-stressed, had great food, wonderful service, a good night's sleep and beautiful surroundings.

Check- in is easy and uncomplicated, greeted with a smile at front desk. Only complaint about front desk is they refuse to give out change in US currency, this should be a welcomed service based on the volume of American guest. Concierge is very accommodating until you don't purchase at the owners presentation! 90min. presentation is actually 5 hours, beware, much pressure!! Rooms are very clean and acceptable except for two major concerns, the air conditioner system in master bedrm went out almost daily and temps were in 90's all week. Resort power went out several times during the week for brief periods but caused air circulation throughout the resort to suffer for several hours afterwards. Beds are comfy but pillows are horrible and sheets have a strange odor even after nightly changes. Room designs and layout are awesome! All restaurant food is very average but waiters are very accommodating. Major PROBLEM in the indoor international buffet restaurant is the FLIES! They are everywhere and on all the food. The resort did not have this problem under control! The best waiter in the entire resort was Carlos Alberto, he is excellent at what he does and is very humble! He would be an asset to any resort. We will be recommending him in the travel industry! You can appreciate this after paying the all inclusive fees. The restaurant manager, Samuel Vargas, on the other hand was horrible!!!!! He only catered to certain guest and did not make all guest feel welcomed and appreciated. We even saw him take tips off the table that were clearly left for the hard working waiters but maybe he distributes their tips to them??? That is when we decided if we were going to leave an extra tip for our waiter we put it in their hand. Samuel's social skills were zero depending on who you were, but Samuel you never know who is in your restaurant and it pays to treat all guest with kindness and respect. Tony in activities, keep up the great job! Resort activities are well planned. Shuttle drivers are great. Resort has a very good security system in place to keep up with the comings and goings of all guest. We felt very safe. Beach lovers there is no access to the resort beach area at this time but the views are wonderful.

My wife and I booked a 7 night stay at the h3r along with 9 of our friends, the trip was about 950 per person and that included the honey moon package and the flight .We arrived at the resort around 5pm and was never once asked about time shares like I read in other reviews. Are check -in was pretty easy,\"I ask to try and get all of our rooms close together which 4 out of the 6 were but the other 2 were jacuzzi rooms so no one really cared. My parties age group are from late 20's to early 30's and can do some serious drinking and eating but were not like out of control spring breakers, if you love to eat and drink there is no disappointment here. From the do it yourself bloody mary and mimosa bar to the 80 plus different shots that we took, they really had it all and it was top shelf stuff. The pool was pretty rad we played a ton of water volleyball. No swim up bar but the pool waiters were pretty much on point , the brick oven pizza place was awesome we probably ate about 10 pizzas a day and they all were killer. The restaurants were all great , we would basically have 3 hour dinners every night but that was by choice after bottles of wine and martinis and appetizers,main course, desert, more wine by the third day we were thinking to ourselves there is no way this hotel is making any money off of us. Mostly all of the food was outstanding, especially the soups!!, wed night was caribbean night which they basically have a bbq out side and you can order any type of meat and they cook it for you right there. We hit the sports bar a few nights they had the laker game on one night so we watched and played pool and drank every type of drink and shot you could think of. All the bartenders are awesome!!. Granted the beach is not that great but oh well thats nature. The service at this resort was pretty much class 1, any thing at anytime we needed something we got it!!! One day are group was going to visit the coba and tulum ruins, so the night before we asked if we could get a cooler filled with beer, water and fruit and sure enough the next morning there it was in the lobby waiting for us!! It was great. All of the staff were awesome always smiling and saying hello and working. They had a fire show one night that was cool we missed the mayan show though, some nights we would just sit outside by the patio or in the lobby talking and drinking pretty late and no one ever complained about noise or anything it was great. The rooms were nice and clean and the hotel ground were very nice. I would recommend some mosquito repellent if your going to hang out at night outside, but really had no problems in the day. Only complaint we had is we had an issue with one of the employees that I wont get into any detail about but the hotel insured us that employee is no longer with them.. 'I hope\". So for about 950 bucks for 7 nights, flight , ground transportation, all you can eat, all you can drink , great service, great staff, great rooms, great friends, this place was to good to be true!!!

Perhaps my husband and I are easy to please.. perhaps we're not well traveled or perhaps our palettes are not as sophisticated as some.. but in our honest opinion.. Hacienda Tres Rios was truly a special place that we hope to return to at some point soon. Check In: We arrived in Cancun via JetBlue direct from JFK (highly recommended) and used USA Transfers ($80 RT) arriving at the Front Desk roughly around 2:30. We were greeted by a refreshing glass of Green Juice (yummy) which was a mixture of Pineapple juice, celery and parsley. We checked in without a problem and given our room key all within about 10 minutes. We then met with our Concierge who gave us a brief overview of the resort including the activities and restaurant schedules. She briefly mentioned the Timeshare tour.. We declined and it was not brought up again. Room: The room was amazing. The beds were super comfortable and the pillows plush and abundant. The bathroom was very nice.. and YES there is a door on the toilet room. The two-person shower is a dream. The I.C.E. system worked everyday of our trip except for a few hours on the first day. It was interactive and very unique. Our view was very nice.. second floor.. left wing of the \"old\" building. Staff: This is where HTR really shines. My husband and I have traveled pretty extensively over the past 15 years and never have we received such attentive service. The staff went above and beyond to make sure our needs were met. We never had a problem being served regardless of where we were. We ordered off of the menu many times and never were we given a look or hint of an attitude. They remember how you liked things the day before and make every attempt to serve the same way. One day, while sitting out on the Martini Lounge, we saw the entire wait staff meeting outside of the Buffet Restaurant. There was a brief inspection.. then they all pulled out their pads and wrote down important information like food allergies of specific guests and they finished it off with an all hands in the middle team Hacienda chant. It was impressive to see their professionalism and camaraderie. We were told they do this everyday prior to opening La Casa Islas for dinner. Room Service was on point and we always received our orders within 20-30 minutes of ordering. Some of our orders were pretty complicated but the staff took good care of us and got our orders right. Shout outs to Raul by the Pool and Yanira and Angel at the Buffet. Over our 5 night stay, we tipped about $110 not to receive special treatment but because the staff truly deserved it. Food/Drinks: The food was very good. We found out early on that it made sense to customize our dishes if they weren't exactly what we wanted. For example, the brick oven pizza was good but we chose to order it with extra cheese and big chunks of grilled chicken (not on the menu). After that slight adjustment it was AMAZING. The Ceviche at the Grill was to die for and the Nachos w/chicken and cheese from the grill was a nice snack during the day. My husband found the drinks to be a little light so be sure to ask for them to put an extra shot in if you swing that way. All in all the food was delicious and the presentation was very creative. Activities: The staff tries really hard to get people into the activities but the majority of the guests are a bit reserved and just came to relax. We attended Karaoke.. did a few numbers and had a good time... Cesar, Gina and Motega did a great job and the singers all did very well. We also took the Jaguar tour which consisted of a Nursery Tour, Snorkeling in the Cenote and Kayaking.. it might be a good idea to get a few Kayaking lessons before actually attempting to do it because it did take quite a bit of coordination and strength. Also make sure to bring \"green\" bug repellent. I used a brand called REPEL that I picked up at a local Target. The Cenote was cool and a non-swimmer like myself felt really safe when I put on my vest. People pay money for these kind of tours and HTR includes them as part of the package. A real treat. Be sure to bring an underwater camera as the Photo Shop charges $15 per 6x8 for each photo taken on the tours at the Cenotes (big rip-off).. however, they are a separate entity and not part of the resort. Grounds: This place is BEAUTIFULLY landscaped. The designer did a great job of creating a feast for the eyes. Nature was at the fore and they preserved many of the original details. The grounds were impeccably clean and inviting and b/c of the layout, it never felt crowded. Pools/Beach: The pools were relaxing and inviting and there were always enough loungers/umbrellas. I spent most of my time in the 3.9' pool and the water was WARM. .. felt like a nice bath. The beach is what it is.. the sand is pristine, the beach is clean and the beds are comfortable.. I feel really bad for HTR because they try so hard to clean it up.. fighting an insurmountable task against nature. I've included pics in my review of of the beach and the staff hard at work to resolve the problem. However, i would NOT.. and i repeat NOT allow this to deter me from visiting this resort as there are SOOOOO many positives. BTW, to get out beach fix in, we took a taxi to Playa Del Carmen (fifth Avenue) and it was great. The strip feels like South Beach Miami. We rented chairs at a beach club named Playa Maya and received two beach front massages for $50 (one hour). The massages were heavenly and by far the best massage I've ever received at a fraction of the price. In terms of improvements, it would've been nice to have some kind of guide channel on the Television or guide in the room for watching tv late nights. Also, I would've liked the option to have bottled juice in the room instead of soda. Also, the theater should be used as a club at night. I know the hotel doesn't want to attract a certain type of crowd.. (trust me I understand) but it would've been nice to have an adult option for entertainment after 10:00 and the theater appeared to be unused space). All in all, Hacienda Tres Rios is a wonderful hotel.

We traveled with a large group of 12 adults and 11 children (ages 7-13). The resort was beautiful, the lobby enchanting. The food was pretty good. Some of the people in our group tried the Mexican Restaurant but felt very disappointed by the limited choices. They wanted more authenticity. However, we soon learned that sometimes when something wasn't in the menu, if you asked, they would still make it for you. We mainly eat at the fabulous buffet. It was heaven for the various taste and eating needs of our children. We tried the Italian restaurant and were very happy with the food there. In terms of the beach, well there wasn't one to swim in. However, they had done an amazing job at providing relaxing furniture (beds, etc) by the water so it was divine to sit there and enjoy the view. The children LOVED swimming and snorkeling in the cenotes. The whole place felt very relaxing and safe at all times. The one negative thing that I will mention is the fact that they advertise a daily schedule. I was excited when I saw the joga classes. The teacher showed up one day and didn't show up for the next three days. So each day I went and waited (with about 7 other guests) and no one in the hotel had any idea were the teacher was.", "Date": "April 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cA fun and memorable honeymoon-\u201d", "Author": "SWesFisher", "ReviewID": "UR62509817", "Content": "First of all, to air it out a bit- I'm a little annoyed by the poorly worded 5 star reviews that were clearly written by interested parties. I think this Jennifer girl that seems to get alot of positive press (\"jennifer is best of all worker at resort. I come Chicago from so I know a thing or some about services of people\") must be angling for a promotion or something. My (now) wife and I stayed a week, I don't remember meeting any jennifers- What we did experience, however, was very, very, very agreeable. In no particular order: (1) Food- Italian Restaurant- get the Eggplant. Holy crap. I don't know if it was the sun or the Chardonnay and bread/olive oil combination (excellent), but I wanted to molest that Eggplant it was so good. Mexican Restaurant- Lamp Chops were so imprssive I had them two nights in a row. Bartender at this restaurant can mix a caucasian. Pizza spot- Very good, dough was light. Breakfast buffet- Wonderful breads and fruits, omelet bar on point, great overall variety of local flair and American Breakfast favorites. Didn't try the Asian Grill. Lunch grill at the pool was very good, and the food hit the spot after sunning yourself all morning. (2) Service- Waiters at meals were tremendous. Can't say it enough, we were very pleased with meal-service. Pool drink waiters were hit or miss, sometimes great, other times they were straight-MIA. (3) Drinks by the pool- Inconsistent, often light on alcoholic content. I had to drink like 40 Pinacoladas to get a buzz. I wanted to get drunk, instead I got a sugar high and had to take a nap. I recommend you order beer, or make very clear to the waiter/bartender that you want it heavy on alcohol. If you are an alcoholic, avoid the mixed drinks because you will get diabetes trying to service your disease. I also heard someone say that he just ordered a shot of rum with every drink and topped it off himself. That gentleman was smarter than I was, I just kept drinking the Pina smoothies none the wiser. (4) Beach- Beach canopy beds were great, although there was some of that, \"I put my flip-flop on the bed so I wil hold it all day and visit it once\" bullcrap. Oh well, heavy New Jersey crowd. (Just kidding, kind of.) Water was not attractive, but it was actually kind of relaxing watching the workers trying to fix it- They even had a mud fight one day. (5) Rivers- WOW. So much fun to snorkel and kayak. BRING YOUR OWN GOGGLES. I didn't and was limited heavily. The rivers more than make up for the beach. They are awesome, the fish are fun, they aren't scared of humans at all. I recommend taking the snorkel tour, and then just walking to the cenote and swimming down the river in the afternoon/evening yourself. It was a reaaly special experience. Kayak yourselves, it was better than the tour. (6) Rooms- Immaculate. Marble everywhere, open and clean. Beds were plush and comfortable. Bathrooms were big, and the two-man showers were top-shelf. In resonse to the guy who complained that the bathrooms had no doors... that's a dirty lie- there was a door to a little toilet room so pooping could be privately enjoyed. As a newly wed, i appreciated the gesture. As an aside, they accidentally gave us two double-beds on our honeymoon after we'd requested a king, they offered to change us, but we refused the change because our view was so great we didn't care. (7) Pools- Huge, pretty. The only thing grinding my gears here was that the kid's pool/ adults only pool rule was not enforced, and we had this total dillweed 4 year-old doing avergae to below-average cannonballs next to us on our final morning. Thankfully, he came too close and I gave him the dirtiest, most aggresive look I could- and it worked: he got so scared he literally ran to his mother (what a baby). It was hard to pretend I'd been innocantly reading because I was laughing so hard inside. We chuckled about that all the way until we landed in Miami. We also decided to wait a few years to have children and to always obey the adults only pool rule because kids poolside are just annoying unless they are yours- (8) Room Service- Mixed Bag: Midnight, the chicken fingers with french fries came in a zap and were hot, salty, and wonderful. I tried to order us breakfast one morning, and had been impressed with the ability to \"order anything, even if not on the menu\" according to other reviews. So I ordered \"Steak and Eggs\"- the confused waiter on the other end of the phone answered my order with, \"Amuricun Breakfust?\" (one of the two breakfast options ON the menu) Trying not to laugh, I said, \"Sure, Amuricun breakfust\" which is eggs, bacon, toast and fruit. (not bad, but certainly not Steak and Eggs) After being told about 30 minutes, I called 40 minutes later to be told my Amuricun Breakfust would arrive in 30 minutes. I politely cancelled the order, and went to the buffet to have another delightful breakfast which was again, top notch. I think breakfast is their busiest time. All in all, if the breakfast debacle was the worst thing, I'd say we had a great time. I highly recommend it (4.75 out of 5)- and hope my stories and tips will help other honeymooners plan and execute their best week possible.

We did not spend the night , and we have decided not to stay here in the future. On April 12 we were staying at the delightful resort of Ceiba Del Mar in Puerto Morelos ( Heaven on Earth) when I suggested to my husband that we take a taxi ride to visit a new resort I had heard of, Hacienda Tres Rios. For our upcming trip we are bringing our 26 year old daughter and we felt she may be a bit bored in the quiet atmosphere of a small spa resort that we have stayed at the past 2 years( Ceiba Del Mar) So we call a taxi and headed down the highway 25 mins. First off, the taxi driver had no idea where it was, and he had been a driver fro many years. We found it, as it does have a big sign out on the highway. It took us 5 mintues to convince the guards on the gates we were not terrorists, seems no one just shows up there on their own to look at the place ( we didn't realize at the time that this place is notorious for trying to sell timeshares to its paying guests and anyone who will take a free brakfast , cab ride etc) It is a long driveway from the highway, so if you were to want to take a collectivo to town, it would be quite a walk, but enjoyable. WHen we arrived at the front door of the resort, it was a beautiful building, very high end service from the doormen and concierge, I observed some guests having their rental cars retrieved and parked for them and very friendly staff. We were taken inside and asked to wait in the lobby, where their are numerous seating areas set up with sofa and chairs in a cosy arrangement. We were approached by a lady named Shakira, who I immediately pegged as a time share rep , being a veteran of presentations myself( always resisted :)) I explained to her that we had just taked a taxi from Puerto Morelos to see their resort as we were intersted in staying there in December. She looked at me like she had just got a bad taste in her mouth ( I almost laughed) and declared that staying at Tres Rios would not be possible as it was a \"Private Club\". I smiled and advised her that I didn't think that was the case since I had seen rooms available for bidding on on line auction sites for very favorable prices and winning bids in the vicinity of 50 pp All inc plus tax a night. Now the gloves were off (LOL). She tells me to take a taxi back to my hotel and they will send a free taxi to get me int he morning. I say NO, I am already here and I want to see the place, I have plans for the next day, Then she starts offering me $$, massages and free meals. I tell her, you don't understand I am already here and I am not looking for anything free, I just want to see the resort. She says this is not possible. I smile sweetly. My husband is getting flustered, he does not like uncomfortable situations. After about 25 mins standoff, she waves her had at me in disgust and says okay go and see the resort...I don't care. I say thank you and off we go to see the grounds and visit the public areas on our own. I already knew I had no intention of staying at a place where people talk to you in this way... The grounds are immpeccably maintained, the pools were clean and the grass manicured beautifully. There were a lot of staff gardening, cleaning etc. In fact there were as many staff as guests, the place was pretty dead. It was around 11am, in the morning. THere is a pizza restaurant with a large oven to cook wood fired pizza, YUM. We walked down to the beach, now this is where I really have to say the place falls down. The beach appears to have been created to some extent.The sand is not the same as other sand on that stretch of coast ( I have stayed in the area on the beach 9 times) and appears to have been brought in from elsewhere. The water was calm, but was a brown brackish color (yuck), not the beutiful turquoise of many beaches in the area. No one was on the beach or in the water,( any guests we saw were in or at the pool) and I personally would not go in the ocean at this resort. I understand it is probably a dense sea grass that causes this appearance, but it was really uninviting. Now for the rivers and canoes and eco experience, we saw one river winding through the resort ,it was greenish slimy looking water and although it didn;t smell bad, I think the potential was there, and I am guessing the mosquitos may enjoy that environment also. Back to the lobby. I cannot tell you again how beautiful the lobby is ( Of course that is not why one goes to a resortLOL) Off the lobby there is a sports bar, a pastry cafe(both deserted) an ATM machine( thumbs up) and a car rental counter ( also great idea) I did not get to see the rooms, but at a new resort like this i am sure they are beautiful. Overall I personally would not stay here due to the snotty \":private club\" attitude and the poor quality of the beach and the ocean. If you are not a beach person and you can get a smoking deal on this place , maybe at an on line auction, and are okay renting a car, I think it would be good value.", "Date": "April 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vacaville, California", "Title": "\u201cAWSOME\u201d", "Author": "chloe1644", "ReviewID": "UR62038192", "Content": "wow i had such a good time i love the staff there especially jennifer flores diaz...she made me feel sooo welcome and i love her shes so into the kids there and always soo helpful she also so into her job and will do whatever she can to make you feel welcome..i hope she is there for many many many more years", "Date": "April 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maple Lake, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cGreat Trip\u201d", "Author": "kotila", "ReviewID": "UR62018931", "Content": "We booked our trip @ HTR because of the good reviews it received. Although there were many negative reviews in March causing us some skepticism, we were pleased with our stay. We were first greeted by Emmanuel with our baggage, Bronson and Mario checked us in rapidly, and Anim told us of the resort activities and amenities. Check in was very fast and efficient, and no hard selling of timeshares, which was greatly appreciated after a full days travel to get there. One of our travelers did take the timeshare presentation and was gifted kindly for it. The rest of us were not even asked twice. The resort is beautiful with its river, foliage, beds on the beach and hammocks to relax, and is immaculately clean. The rooms are spacious, beds are soft with what seems like a feather topper, the shower is one I hope to duplicate in my next house, and appreciated the plush robes. We had one of our party injured and on crutches (they provided a wheelchair for his use) and helped us out with that several times. In fact, big Oscar gave him a piggy back ride after taking the snorkel tour and we didn\u2019t have his crutches, and of course the wheelchair didn\u2019t work in sand. Now that\u2019s service! On the note of handicap accessibility, the resort does have many ramps to use, but the wooden bridges over the river are tough. Even with someone pushing, it\u2019s difficult, but it\u2019s better than some I\u2019ve seen. The pool area is supposed to have adults, and one for kids. That isn\u2019t enforced. I will say that the kids we saw were well behaved, and it should be said that this is a couple or family resort. Not meant for the hoopla-college kids. Went thru that before\u2026 won\u2019t do that again. The resort has just over 200 rooms, and they said there was over 600 guests. The only time it felt crowded in the least was at breakfast buffet and that was minimal. There are 5 places to eat; the Grill and Stone Fired Pizzaria at the pool, the buffet, and 2 fine dining; one Mexican, the other alternated daily between Asian and Italian. The food was good, and could even be described as exotic, but I\u2019m from rural MN, so anything other than beef, fish or venison is exotic (haha). We ran into 3 gals that actually left the resort because the food was bad! We didn\u2019t find any bad food. One resort will never please everyone\u2019s taste buds, and certainly can\u2019t imagine anyone making food their priority to the resort.. but to each their own. The breakfast buffet did get a little \u201cold\u201d after so many days, but how much variety can you have feeding 600 people for breakfast? They did change some of the main entrees daily, so it\u2019s not like it was exactly the same each day. We found ourselves eating at the Grill or the pizzeria during the day because we stayed at the pool most of the time. Their food was very good. There is always some things that one would wish better, such as the beer at the resort was tap beer (except room service), and the liquor choices were a bit limited. Because of the ecological management of the resort, there were no straws, no pretty umbrellas or coconut shells for your drinks. Oh, and they could use one more garbage can in the room! The one thing that made our stay so memorable was the staff. I can\u2019t say enough about them. Emmanuel and Anim mentioned above, and Cristobel, our favorite pool waiter who was a bundle of laughs, Carlos at the dinner buffet\u2026 they were all so wonderful about wanting to make our stay enjoyable and had infectious smiles constantly. We even shared a few drinks with Emmanuel and Anim in Playa one night. Let me not forget Oscar at the spa\u2026 I received the best massage ever. However, I will say that I had a second massage and felt like I\u2019d been put thru a meat grinder. Ask for him \u2013 you won\u2019t be disappointed.

This property was described as a #1 LUXURY based property...... Needless to say TresRios is not a luxury-based property nor is it relaxing at all. From the time we arrived and they did not have our name on the reservation list until the day we checked out it was a true nightmare. We went to be pampered and enjoy new opportunities; such as VIP concierge service, butler service, onsite yacht club, included tours and use of non motorized water sports at no additional fee. We were excited about having daily transportation to Playa del Carmen, spa services, and most excited about the VIP rooftop lounge and jacuzzi area. The lounge and VIP area that was included and advertised was NOT ready for access. The shuttle service was available at no charge for all guest, non motorized water sports are available at no charge for all guest, yacht club (as stated onsite of the description page from you guys) is one hour away, and you must pay an additional tax or service fee on yacht, massages, horse lesson, and rental car, which is suppose to be included in the 300.00 dollar a day per person fee. Many of the amenities offered in the exclusive club package are FREE for all guest....which leaves us paying extra for nothing! Another feature promised at check in was priority seating at dinner. Our butler would make reservations for us, yet when we arrive they would tell us that the resort did not offer priority seating. We would wait just like others for and hour or so when we were suppose to have a perk of priority seating. It was VERY embarrassing to be told in front of many other guest that they do not have reservations and they do not know who would tell us that. When we arrived for the spa service we had 4 individuals in our unit so all four were to receive a massage at no cost (included in package). They refused to do two of us and were very RUDE in front of others about doing a complimentary massage. The spa as well is incomplete and not a world-class spa. There was no locker room area for changing or relaxation room like others properties on your list. Very poor spa service and area for relaxing! We had all saved up money to return to the spa throughout the week but after the unwelcoming/rude service we did not return back into the spa. The butlers were often unavailable due to having to cover other work areas of the resort. They did reserve us a beach bed each day we were onsite but after the morning we did not see them again, unless we went into the main lobby where they had to work for others. They tried hard to assist in many ways but they are expected to do too many other things. Shakira our VIP concierge assistant did not follow through with anything she was suppose to schedule or do for us. I went to her on Sunday with a weekly list of about 5 events/activities/transportation needs. She scheduled two items while I was with her and assured she would have the rest on Monday morning. Needless to say I had to return several times including the day of each event to ask had things been handled or did we need to get assist/cancel plans. She did an extremely poor job with helping and offering ideas of things to do while on vacation on or off property. I did not feel like it was my place to go see her each day to confirm the job she was doing. Many of the individuals working at this property are poorly trained or friendly. The service was very inconsistent....one night we would have turn down service on only one bed and then the next night no turn down service. There was never a night where each room was consistently the same after returning from dinner. Many nights/days it was not even tidy (cleaned) from morning breakfast or evening dishes. We had to ask for individuals to come get our dishes or bring clean towels, etc. Our 2 bedroom unit the first night (5003) had a MAJOR leak in the closet and no one even asked about our personal belongings or if things were wet or ruined. They asked us to change rooms, without offering assistant or as much as bringing us the key for there inconvenience. We had to pack up, go get keys, move luggage all without any offering of help. The thing that bothered me most was that NO ONE ever asked about how our clothes and shoes were.....needless to say several new shoes were soaked and clothes too. We then moved to 5203 which was the same unit just a few floors up on Sunday. The hot water did not work most of the time and the safe was broken. We had to call twice (and visit the front desk) and it took them 14 hours to send someone to change out the safe. NOT one day the entire week did we all 4 have a hot shower. It was cold/hot cold/hot\u2026..very uncomfortable. I have never taken so many hot showers especially having to pay a total of 9000.00 plus dollars for the week. We put in 3 work orders and each time they would say to turn the shower on, get out, turn the sink on, then get back in and turn the shower on again. It is not my idea of a luxury vacation to get in and out of the shower (which is cold) to get hot water. This is a resort problem! We had an invasion of LOTS of ants on Monday and called for them to come spray and about 45 minutes later and ants all over the room they finally came up to our room. The problems that occurred were mostly due to poor service, lack of caring, and unwillingness to help. The resort has many problems that should have been worked out after being open over a year. Most employees are expected to do too many things and not very well trained for the job they are doing. The food at this resort is NOTHING like the food at our properties you guys have. It was more buffet than anything and was a minimal selection each night. If they had a resort event they would close down the restaurants and you would have to do room service or the event food. The hacienda grill was open most of the time and fairly good food. We are not alcohol drinks and to get a tea refill was extremely hard. Many nights we had one glass and requested more but never received them. Not very impressive in the food category! When we went down to get the new room keys after the leak, we returned all 4 keys and they would only give us one key due to being short on keys. I did not feel like that was my personal problem but it because my issue. I returned my old keys so why should I be penalized for their lack of keys? Another things that really bothered me was that the resort offered fine dining arrangements\u2026when I asked our VIP rep she would not reserve anything to that nature because she thought we should do the chef dinner in the kitchen. I explained to her it was a 37th wedding anniversary and it needed to be only the two of them but she would not agree to help with arrangements. I later asked her if we could plan a dinner or event offsite for the anniversary but she said she would have to get back in contact with me. After checking 3 days in a row I gave up. They were there to offer help and assistant to us..,..that is what we paid for right? After booking with The Registry Collection we were expecting a VIP vacation....because that is what we were promised. Yet it did not happen. The resort is in no way a LUXURY based property.

I went in expecting to be amazed at every turn and was promptly let-down throughout my stay. That said, the place is not a dump nor did I not have fun. I enjoyed myself but the reviews elevated H3R beyond reality. The whole eco stuff always makes me chuckle at resorts, no matter their physical footprint. It's more of a marketing tool because all resorts do similar \"recycling\" programs based solely on cost-containment. But I digress. Check-in wasn't terribly great. We were two friends traveling with the honeymoon package and we had to sit through our very personable concierge's itinerary for us. We were tired from a long day of travel and just wanted our room. But, she was cordial and well-informed ~ maybe let us check-in and set a time to get our dinner and massage schedule. Rooms are tragically average. They have no character, no charm, no interesting design. If you've ever been to any resort in Mexico, expect more of the same. The one thing H3R's room offer is youth. The resort is relatively new so the animals who go to AI's have yet to destroy these rooms. The upside is there aren't many of the typical AI-types there so you get less braided-hair/NASCAR tank couples than in Cancun. Maybe the rooms will stay decent for a few years. Beds were comfy, that's for sure. We both slept well and really appreciated the TempurPedic pillows. The ICE\u2122 system is a POS and H3R should remove it because it really diminishes your experience and harms the brand. EVERYONE we spoke to either had issues with it or didn't even have one in their room because it was broken. Food was the most underwhelming part. I traveled with a Foodie (and Drinkie) so she was unimpressed much of the time (aside from lunch and some desserts). I enjoyed the food from an AI point-of-view but wouldn't call it haute cuisine outside the resort. It was a bit repetitive and seemed to only utilize a few staples for all dishes. We both loved the sea bass for lunch and we'd suggest ordering it grilled instead of with the sauce they smother the flavor with. Their rice cannelloni dessert was yummylicious. I also enjoyed the Honeymoon Lobster Dinner which 3 times the size/weight of the regular lobster you can order a day in advance. We also had the Chef's Dinner and like all reviewers, I suggest this. The tacky, touristy feel of the \"impromptu\" dinning setting off the kitchen was forced for the concept, but OK, I get it, we're touristing. Oscar, charming as every review says, creates some interesting courses. Not Michelin Diamond-level but you will certainly enjoy his choices. Breakfast was beige. Over-cooked and dry everything. Fruit was fresh and yummy. They have a drink there and the name escapes me but it's something like the Skin Refresher... very very good. The eco-tour was a total joke. I have to question the other reviewers' level of cultural sophistication because our tour was 20 minutes down a clear creek. It anti-WOW'ed me. Pools were separated enough so you could do your thing be it splash or chill and not bug anyone. The pools also seemed to have an inordinately large number of chairs based on occupancy but that would be nit-picking and I've done enough of that already. Moving on to the beach. Quiet, mostly soft (enough), ample Bali beds, not much foot traffic from the other resorts nearby. A great place to relax and do nothing. The water is murky in sections and they say it'll clear up once they regrow/recrop the mangroves but you have a pool if you want water. Massage is a total joke. Skip this part. It's a total FAIL\u2122. Plus, they're not marketed as a spa destination yet they charge Canyon Ranch rates. You will be upset at the $180USD kinda-sorta massage. If there's only one thing you take away from this review it should be to avoid this profit-center. With all the negative stuff being said, you'd think I hated H3R, but I didn't hate it at all. I'm simply pointing out things I felt were deficient so you can have a more accurate expectation level. I'd recommend H3R to my friends and think if you want a very relaxed resort that's not a boring mega-resort, H3R will fit the bill. You'll be fed well, you can drink as much or as little, and it will seem like there aren't many others to bug your holiday. Even the kids were well-mannered, a rare treat at ANY hotel. If you're a Peninsula/Park Hyatt person, you'll be unimpressed but will still enjoy your time. If you're more of a Westin/Sheraton person you'll love this place and hold it in high regard.

We were celebrating our 28th wedding anniversary. First I must say we are very good tippers to all the staff including housekeeping, waiters at buffets and dining and drinks waiters. We booked through \u201cOrbitz\u201d so was not assigned wrist bands which meant we did not get special treatment and was actually told this by a wrist banded \u201cTimeshare\u201dmember that they were told they get special everything. Check in pretty much we got there about 12:30pm, But of course the room wasn\u2019t ready. They play the waiting in anticipating game. We live in the Myrtle Beach, SC area which is a beach resort area and they do the same here regardless of whether the room is ready or not. I realize the staff do need a few hours to clean vacating rooms, but why have grid lock and have everybody checking in at once. Assign the rooms as they become available. People were checking out very early in the morning on most days. Saturday & Sunday was the busiest check out and check in, because this is a \u201cTime Share Resort\u201d. We checked in - you guessed it 3pm. The rooms were very spacious and well appointed along with a very private balcony. No complaints there. It seemed like there were too many service people going in and out of your room on a daily basis. One to deliver toiletries, one to deliver beverages then the housekeeper. We left a tip each day for the housekeeper to come back early one day and the room wasn\u2019t serviced, the tip was gone. Shampoo had been delivered though. So I don\u2019t know who got the tip. Maybe the first one in. The staff were very polite especially the dining staff. They only work an eight hour day, because we did ask a few people how long their shift was. They were just moving around from different area to area. It seemed like they were always there. I must say Chef Oscar seemed like he lived there. Speaking of Chef Oscar. We wanted to dine with the Chef at the \u201cChefs Table\u201d, but was told that we would have to choose a bottle of wine right at the time of making the reservation. We were whisked into the wine vault and was shown only what Hector wanted to sell us. A cheap bottle of Mexican wine that would cost us about $95.00 USD. We had no other options or was not offered a wine list. I even asked if they had a Shiraz, but was told \u201cOh it is the same price the Mexican is better\u201c After having the worst wine of the house which happened to be Mexican we have ever tasted we opted out of the \u201cChefs Table\u201d meal. I would have rather paid for the meal and not the wine. The other issues we had was there was absolutely no place to get a decent cocktail. The pool area I think they left out a crucial part of the drink. \u201cthe alcohol\u201c Unless your were standing right in front of them I believe most of the drinks were just mixers. I must say when we were able to get someone to serve us in the \u201cMartini lounge\u201d ( which is just a few rattan furniture thrown around outside nothing formal no bar set up) The drinks were quite good, but each time you needed a refill you would have to go looking for someone to make it for you. Tea time at the Martini lounge was a joke. For coffee and tea you can go to the pastry shop and get a good cup of coffee. Most of the time no one was there to serve you, but we just winged it. The coffee came out good. Be careful of the goodies they had on display. We saw so many children just touching every piece and putting it back which was the biggest turnoff. Never found the sports bar with a bartender in it. Couldn\u2019t figure that one out. In my opinion after 9pm at night you might as well go to bed, because everything is being picked and getting ready for the next day. Kids were left to be by themselves all over the place. Always running and screaming with no regard as to anyone but themselves. We saw so many being very rude to the staff just like they were their servants. Not a parent in sight. The adults only and adults quite pool was non-existent. This the only reason we booked at Tres Rios was for the quite and our own area. \u201cAdults. We have children and grandchildren so we have nothing against them, but please be respectful of other people who are also trying to enjoy their vacation.. The food overall was good. I did get very sick from eating the Yucatan pig in the Mexican Restaurant. I am still trying to get over it after 2 days after eating it. We don\u2019t eat early, but do like to have a cocktail or two before dinner and the same after dinner, but this place was very hard to enjoy this. We are in our 60s and were very bored and couldn\u2019t wait to get home. We did go on a couple of the tours which was very interesting, but the staff has their own itinerary. Our tour left of the Nursery tour so we booked for the next afternoon (which was the only time for that week). Nobody stopped by to pick us up. We did notify the Cenotes tour people and they said someone was coming right by. We waited in the hot sun outside for over 40 minutes then decided that they were not coming. We went to the concierge the next day and he put us on the Cenotes trip and said when we were finished with that someone would drive us back to the hotel. ( remember we are in our 60s very healthy, but they didn\u2019t know that) Big mix-up again. I felt we put a damper in their tour, because now they were forced to go to the nursery which was on the itinerary to start with. When we were finished with the tour we were told to wait by the circle rock and someone was coming to get us. Guess what happened next. We waited for about 25mins. This time in the hot sun. I finally told my husband we need to start walking. We walked all the way back to the hotel without seeing anyone. For all they know we could still be out there walking. It was actually not a bad walk. Had we known with a map of sorts we would have done it by ourselves. We actually did this everyday thereafter walk to the cenotes and the nursery by ourselves. They were very short on info. And had maps copied with a lot of info missing. Did someone say this was a five star? My rating on this resort is a 3 star at best. We were promised a visa card that would give us a discount on purchases. We never received this from \u201cDiana\u201d I think she was actually from Time share sales, because there was another Diana that was a concierge that was so nice. We mentioned that we had a free massage coming to us , but that was brushed aside. If we took the \u201cTimeshare Tour\u201d we would get $200USD added onto the visa gift card we never saw. We saw some people going into the sales meeting and coming out over 5 hours later. Not a way to spend a vacation. Last but not least. Thank goodness this happened on our last meal at the hotel, because I think I would have starved to death had I experienced this in the beginning. I saw a waiter at breakfast setting up a table for 6 with fresh cups, plates, sugar, creamer knives forks you name it then have a sneezing fit right over the entire table without any attempt to cover or turn away his face.", "Date": "April 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "los angeles", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel but not for single people\u201d", "Author": "lmb1979", "ReviewID": "UR61366409", "Content": "I will say that this hotel is very beautiful.

I booked it back in early December when I read fantastic reviews, and I admit that I was a little nervous given the negative reviews a couple weeks ago. My fears were completely unfounded as the resort was great! Let me first say that my husband and I have never stayed at an AI before and never been to Mexico--we have travelled lots in Europe and are more used to being travelers than tourism. However, this was my break so I wanted to relax. Wow! We feel like we've been gone for weeks because we are so rested! ROOM: Our room was beautiful! It was very comfy & extremely clean. The ICE (touch screen computer in the room) worked until the last couple of days we were there. The minifridge wasn't cold so I completed a request on the ICE and we received a phone call & a workman came within 15 mins.! The ICE listed all hotel info and activities along with Internet access. The TV was good -- we watched several English language stations: a Miami local channel, AN (American Network), ESPN, BBC & HBO (one channel was in English w/Spanish subtitles and another was just Spanish). Our balcony looked out the backside at the greenery--not bad. I requested a hairdryer and they brought one the next day--I had to be in the room for them to leave it. RESTAURANTS: All the food is good. We ate in all the restaurants. We ate buffet breakfast daily and enjoyed it. At certain times it was crowded, but we never had to wait long. We also ate it for lunch a couple of times and found it very good. Porto Bello (Italian) & Kotori (Asian) were fine. We liked El Alebrije (Mexican) upstairs best with its Yucatan flavors. The Hacienda Grill was nice--we ate both lunches & a dinner there. Il Forno Pizzeria was good for lunch a couple of times (they could use some more shade there). We never ordered lunch at the poolside or beach but saw others doing that. P\u00e2tisserie Caf\u00e9 de Paris was a daily stop for us to enjoy a cappucino and sweet or savory nibbles. Food presentation was always beautiful. BEACH & POOLS: There are 2 pools, adult & kids. We tried both and liked both. The water temp was fine. They are interesting shapes that allow for some privacy if you desire. There are 3 hot tubs at the edge of the kid pool (odd place seems to me). I never tried them but my husband did and said they were not very hot. The closer to the beach, the cooler it is to sit because of the breezes. We absolutely loved the beach beds! Several days we just stayed on a bed and read and napped--heaven! The resort has a policy of no reserving chairs, but that was not observed. Every morning we saw towels, sandals, books, etc. on the chairs and beds. That said, I never saw anyone not get a chair. One afternoon, a woman had one of the employees in tow and he was rounding up enough chairs for her. The beach swimming is not bad but not the best. There is lots of blackish seaweed, and there were men working to remove it every day. Some days it was better than others (depending on the tides I think). My husband and I both went in. It's not very deep though, so you can walk a long way out. ACTIVITIES & ENTERTAINMENT: They have a daily list of activities so you can do as much or as little as you like. We took a Kayak tour and a bike tour. I recommend both & book early. The resort sits on 326 acres and has a plant nursery, trails, & rivers. I noticed that you can pay to go on cenotes tours elsewhere, but this resort has 10 of them! We enjoyed the evening shows: Mayan Show, Fire Show, & Milissa (dinner show). This is not a hot night spot. I would say the activities are more for families or people over 40 (though we saw several college aged kids there). STAFF: Our service was incredible! The entire staff were very friendly, helpful, kind, and knowledgeable. They always greeted us in passing. I really can't praise them enough. At check-in our concierge asked us to join a breakfast to learn about their \"marketing plan,\" but we declined (after reading about the high pressure sales in other reviews). She only asked one other time about it--no pressure. OVERALL: The resort buildings are beautiful. They are kept clean--employees always cleaning windows, doors, floors, and gardens. I saw several kids spilling their drinks at the breakfast buffet, but someone always quickly mopped up after them. The grounds are beautiful--lots of lush vegetation and flowers. The setting is divine--the combo of the golden buildings, blue water, and green plants--aah! We would return to H3R again for a relaxing vacation.

Here is my honest review. The hotel is beautiful! The food is average to slightly above avg. Get to the restaurants early as they fill up fast. The staff was very friendly. Although the service did vary from day to day at the pool and beach area. Speaking of the beach , that was my biggest disappointment. The water is not the crystal blue water you would hope it would be. Therefore snorkling there is a waste of time. Even in the small rivers were the water is much nicer there is not much to see. An occasional fish, but mostly mangrove roots. Look into snorkling at reef encounter in the village of Pueblos Morales at the travel agent desk near the sports bar. If you like lobster ask about a lobster dinner. I wish i knew this but i didn't until I got back. If you want to do things like the kayak, bike or snorkeling tour make sure you reserve a spot the day before because they do run out of equipment. you can kayak on your own at the north end of the beach near the bridge if the kayaks are there just take one and head up the river. As for the cocktails I found them to be very weak. Don't be afraid to speak up and ask them to double the alcohol...You're paying for it. The pools are very nice and the night entertainment was ok. not much for teens to do aside from the pool , beach volleyball and tours. Finally, this hotel is very nice.

There was some good, some not so good- nothing really major, but this is a very mellow resort- not alot going on. Thanks to everyone who writes these reviews, I was pleasantly surprised when, upon arrival, there was absolutely no pressure to do a time share program. Our room was not ready (it was 1 PM) so we were sent to the buffet for lunch and told to come back at 3. When we arrived back at the front desk at 2, our room was ready. It was not the oceanview room we paid for, it faced the mangroves- very unattractive, but we were too tired from waking up at 3 AM to make a fuss. That being said- the room was exactly as pictured on the website. There was no \"Pillow Menu\" but the beds were very comfy. The resort was immaculate- but we found out the Mexican President was arriving in a few days for a opening ceremony- so it seemed to us that the level of cleanliness and care went down a bit after his departure. In the beginning of the week there were maintenance people cleaning the water in the \"rivers\" and oiling the wooden walkways constantly. As for the food- the breakfast buffet was great. Lunch at the pool was also very nice. You can order from your lounge chair from either the Grill or Pizzeria. We never did the buffet lunch. Poolside service was more than adequate. We were on the AI plan and found that tipping the waiters assured us of incredible service for the entire week. Dinners were a disappointment after reading the rave reviews from other travellers on TA. The Italian and Asian restaurants alternate in the same small space- the Asian restaurant was awful- Italian was OK. Problem is that there are no reservations, and a very limited number of seats so if you aren't there at 6:30 ther can be a wait of 1- 1 1/2 hours for a table. The Hacienda Grill was also very good. The Mexican restaureant was very accommodating- they made our daughter quesadillas that were not on the menu, and had an interesting selection of \"real\" Mexican dishes- but I could pass on the Mariachis playing Hey Jude. The dinner buffet was not good at all. As for activities- we went snorkelling, bicycling and kayaking in groups. They were well organized and well run- just remember your bug spray. There were hobie cats on the beach that were available and were a lot of fun. The beach was the funkiest (not in a good way) beach I have ever visited ANYWHERE. The water was brown and disgusting due to the rivers emptying . If you walked 100 yards north, the beach changed and the water was clear with velvety sand- but there aren't any chairs there. The pools were immaculate and well staffed. There were activities such as water polo and beach volley ball but no pressure to participate. The pools were the perfect temperature- not to warm and not too cold! The adult pools were not adults only, but we didn't have a problem because we stayed at the family pool- it was at least 10 degrees cooler there due to a breeze off the ocean Evening activities were, to be kind, pathetic. Maybe it's because we are New Yorkers, or just that we have been to alot of other AI type resorts, but there was NOTHING to do before dinner . We like to relax with a cocktail before heading into dinner, but there is nowhere to hang out- the lobby bar opens at 11 PM after the \"show\". As I mentioned- you have to eat early to be guaranteed a seat, so if you are done eating at 8, there is nothing to do until 9 when the\"show\" starts. Milissa- a singer- was worse than a bad Vegas lounge act. The fire show was interesting for about 5 minutes. The Mayan Experence was the best - but then again, compared to what? They have a casino night that is cute. Karaoke was karaoke. We spent most nights in our room watching Star Wars on TV- not real exciting... A Staff photographer is around on all activities taking photos which are available for purchase at outrageously high prices. They charged $220 USD for a disk with 25 photos. $370 USD for a disk with 50 photos and there was no negotiating with them. How many ways can you spell RIP-OFF???

Our stay was for 4 nights, followed by 4 nights in 'real Mexico' (which worked well for us, although may not be for everyone). We booked a car pick-up (not via the resort) for $45 which was great, and were at the resort within 30 minutes of getting our luggage. We were lucky as the 'concierge' was not available when we got there - no nice welcome drinks for us, but the bellboy took us right up to the room and showed us how everything worked, including the computer which had the restaurant times and menus, so we did not miss the concierge talk (and were never asked to listen to a time-share sale). Our room was lovely, clean, everything worked well. A great view of the pools and beach, I enjoyed ordering up some special pillows, and, most importantly to me - it was quiet! Even when it was Casino night or the Fire Show, if the balcony door was closed you couldn't hear a thing. Of course, one night some drunk person was knocking on my door at 3 am - that was annoying (and she was quite confused) but not the hotel's fault. We only got 'turn-down' service once, and room service seemed to work about half of the time (the food was often cold when it did arrive). My older kids tried the kids club - one loved it, one thought it was OK. The young women who run it are lovely, but the dynamic depends on the kids there - on our first day, it was a bunch of boys running around, and my girls were intimidated (once they discovered the Barbie dolls, all was fine). The kid's club went on some great adventures (kayaking, planting trees) which I thought was kind of cool. The food was OK - my husband and I like to eat quality food, and that was one of our reasons for choosing this resort, but nothing we ate was amazing. The buffet was fine... always some exotic fruit, lots of desserts, but nothing that I felt like I needed to get the recipe for. I was disappointed in the lack of real fruit drinks - Mexico being the land of 'Agua Frescas' - but all they had was bottled apple juice, bottled orange juice. The menu on the room computer offered all sorts of real fruit smoothies, but you couldn't actually order them anywhere (which was even more annoying than just not having them listed!) As others have said, trying to get food or drinks at the beach is almost impossible, and can be spotty at the pool - but really, it's not that big of a deal to walk the short distance and order what you want (which they gladly deliver to you). The wait staff at the pool were the best - Ambrosio was so sweet with my kids, even bringing them drinks when they did not order anything just so he could chat with them (which they loved). We did enjoy the resort tours (kayak, snorkeling) although everyone seemed to have different information on these - the concierge said 'take the family' but once we got there it was obvious that a 1-year old could not be on these trips. Also all of the tours go down the same river, and all start with a tour of the same nursery - this could get boring! That said, once you get to know the activities staff they will go out of their way to help you - for example, they drove my husband and eldest daughter out one day so they could snorkel without waiting for the group. The beach beds were awesome... I LOVED the lack of music and announcements in public places... the evening activities were perfect for us (laid back and quiet) and it was certainly not a 'spring break destination', which we appreciated. I do think that the longer you stay, the more the staff gets to know you, the more \u2018perks\u2019 you will get. It would be nice if you got those perks from the start, without having to ask or look for them. The beach itself was not great, after we left the resort we went to a tiny town which had a much nicer beach and real Mexican food and drinks at a fraction of the cost. But we did miss the luxury of being waited on and never having to carry money or think about how to feed hungry kids. Would we return? Realistically, probably not, because we like to try new things and we felt like we got to see all this resort had to offer during our time there.

He immediately made us feel at home. Hellen checked us in with a wonderful smile and Jesus took us to our room explaining everything from the air conditioning to how to order room service. Whenever we passed Jesus in the lobby he would inquire about our stay and ask if he could be of any assistance. This was the attitude of each and every staff member at Hacienda Tres Rios (H3R). If you are looking for a \"Spring Break\" type of resort where you can party your brains out, H3R is not the place for you. We live in New York state where life is always rush rush and stressful. If you are looking for a resort where the staff learns your name and brings your favorite drink while yoou relax, then this is the place for you. Just the right amount of activitities if you wish to participate. If you want to spend the day reading and napping on the beach beds that's OK. A wonderful place to leave your cares behind. Never did we have to rush to the beach to be certain to have a beach bed. Yes the water at the beach is not crystal clear. That is still the effect from hurricane Wilma. That storm wiped out many mangrove trees whose roots are still breaking down and washing up. Ricardo and his crew are hard at work restoring the beach. Ricardo is gentle man that I can only compare to the wise mountainmen of the Rocky Mountains. His knowledge and understanding of the eco-system is priceless. Your first impression of him may be a grizzly man working on the beach. On several occaisions we saw him place beautiful shells and pieces of coral into the hands of women and children while his grandfatherly eyes twinkled. The section of beach between the rivers is a wonderful place to explore and swim. While at the beach you can be certain that Agelica will take your food and drink order. Angelica is a wonderful woman with a contagious smile. A person we will never forget. The Beach beds are cleaned everyday and the bedding changed out periodically during the day. A wonderful place to relax and escape the stress of our day to day lives. The pools were always crystal clear. Manuel was alway friendly and eagar to bring us what ever we wanted to eat or drink. Even when we were walking through the pool area to the beach Manuel would greet us by name, ask if we were enjoying our stay and if he could be of service. Angelica and Manuel made our experience at the beach or the pool a memorable experience. We ate breakfast every morning at the buffet. I chose not to eat omlettes, pancakes, French toast, or bacon. I can eat that food any day of the week at home. Every morning I chose to eat something new. The variety was great. One morning I had chicken with some sort of black sauce . When I asked the waiter Orlando about the sauce he explained that it was a Mayan negro relleno sauce. It was DELICIOUS. Orlando and Gregorio were always very kind and polite. Gregorio jokingly called me Senor Michelada because he knew that I so enjoyed a cold Michelada. Yes you will probably be approached by members of the H3R sales team. I can say that Dana, Fred, Marc and Chad were very respectful. It is their job to sell residence memberships. They do their best to explain all of the membership packages available. They will listen to what you have say. Never did we feel as if they were twisting our arm to commit to purchasing a membership. We feel they were extremely professional and courteous. Whenever we would see them after our first contact they too would greet us by name and ask if our stay was satisfactory. They would always take the time to engage in conversation and we know that their kindness was sincere and not an attempt to pressure us into puchasing a membership. The concierge staff was wonderfull. Diana, Yarra, Hellen, and Trinidad were always helpful and available. They were very kind and patient. Shannon from Alberta, Canada, who worked at one of the other desks, was always helpful when the concierge desk was very busy. Oscar the head chef and Samuel were outstanding. These two men seemed to be everywhere. They were always taking care of little details while always having the time to chat with visitors. They are SUPERMEN. Head waiters Martin and Jose made dining a wonderful experience. Jose's Tequila tasting was very enjoyable and educational. Because of Jose, my friends now say I am a tequila snob. I have tried to share my new knowledge of agave with them. Jose spoke Spanish during the Tequila tasting while Osiris translated in English. Though Jose speak English, this made the experience very authentic. If anyone enjoys good Tequila I highly recommend this activity. Jose's knowledge of Mexican wine and spirits is incredible. Other members of the restaurant staff that went out of their way to make our stay memorable were Oswaldo, and Wilbur. Wilbur gave Michelad lessons. I am certain that I have left out others who were so dedicated to making us comfortable. One of the young housekeeping staff is Raul. Everyday he was sweeping the floors at breakfast and later was cleaning the restrooms at the pool. He doesn't speak English so I asked another staff member to tell him how much we appreciated his hard work at keeping the resort spotless. He responded with a great smile as if to say, \"Thank you for noticing.\" Every day after that he always made it a point to greet us and give us his spectacular smile. Pastries are one of my true passions. The little patry shop was one of my favorite places. If you must have your daily tea or just a sweet tooth that needs to be satisfied, you must visit the pastry shop every day. The thing we most love about Hacienda Tres Rios is their dedication to the environment. Early every morning I was up at dawn walking to the vivero (nursery) or the cenotes with my binoculars. I saw over 40 species birds, native mammals, butterflies, and fish. Every day I watched the Tejon ( Coati) in the trees eating the fruit of the Zapote. H3R truly operates in a green eco-friendly way. I recommend the Sensadventure. It was absolutly wonderful. The staff that leads the varous outdoor tours and activities are SUPERB. Jennifer's love and knowledge of butterflies and insects is amazing. Andy is willing to take you by Hobbie Cat to the reef for snorkling. Osiris' and Tony's kind friendly nature makes every biking or kayakiing tour a truly enjoyable experience. Just like everyone else they always greeted us by name and asked if there was anything they could do to make our stay even more enjoyable. Sergio is one of the BEST nature interpreters I have ever encountered. Dana, one of the sales representatives set up a personal nature tour with Sergio. I work at a nature center and have been involved in environmental education, and nature interpretation for years. I was completely blown away by Sergio's talent. His abilities would make my college professor proud. He explained the Ancient Geology of the Yucatan, the flora and fauna, the Mayan culture and how H3R fits in. He so patiently answered all of my questions and kindly listend to all of my stories about our natural world. Sergio taught me a few Mayan words that I was able to use on our Mayan tour guide at the ancient city of Coba. The guide was amazed that I knew how to thank him in Mayan. I have Sergio to thank for that. I felt as if Sergio and I were family. He made leaving Hacienda Tres Rios the most difficult part of our vacation.

The room was nice - no tub, but no problem. The beds were the most comfortable we've slept on in Mexico - this will make our 5th trip. We really liked that the resort was small. We never felt crowded and there was no obnoxious behaviour from other guests trying to save palapas. We also did not have to make reservations for the restaurants which was refreshing. The staff was attentive and pleasant and as in previous posts, We went ahead and tipped even though tips are included. The folks who there are really working hard. Oscar, the head chef was omnipresent and an assest to the resort. Our kid really liked the kid's club and cried the first day when it closed. The beach does have debris, but we didn't care b/c the river was clear, cool and refreshing. A trip to the cenotes was a plus. We enjoyed the low key atmosphere with no loud music or Spring Break crowd. We don't need others to keep us entertained. We just wanted to relax and read and this goal was achieved. There are plans to expand the resort to 1000 rooms (I think). The idea is disappointing b/c it will mean deforestation of existing mangrove tress, and it was sad to see that the flock of birds nesting in trees that we could see from our window will soon lose their home. As long as it stays small and relaxing I'll come back. Say no to any time share offers if you don't want time wasted with the pitch. Nothing comes for free.

We were concerned about the time-share pitch, but that never happened to us. We were greeted by friendly, welcoming staff who could not do enough for us. What happens when you arrive, is they sit you down in the lobby and go over the activities and events for the time you are there. BTW, the green drink that you are handed in the lobby is great(pineapple juice, celery and parsley-Yummy!) You should sign-up for events quickly if you are there during a busy travel time like Spring Break or other holidays as they tend to fill up fast. We took advantage of the bicycling, kayaking, and snorkling. Also sailing. You sign up in the lobby, but we also noticed that if you go down to the beach and head North(left) you can sign-up for sailing right there. You can also take a kayak from the beach and go up the river and back. We discovered this, but no one ever mentioned it as an option while down at the beach. There is usually a staff person on the beach to check out the kayaks from 10am-4pm. The snorkling is not to be missed. My kids loved this activity. Tony and Gina are the guides. They are fun and knowledgeable. Really loved this. You are taken to 3 cenotes, and all are beautiful. Bring a camera. You can leave it on shore. Great photo-ops. BTW, there is a staff photog who takes pictures at all the evening events and activities you do on the grounds. We did not buy them....did not feel like spending money on a package deal or pay 12-bucks for a photo. All the reviews mentioned the beach not being swimmer-friendly. That is correct. Fun to sit and look at, but did not swim. We did, however walk about 5-10 minutes south along the beach and ended up at a somewhat usable beach there. We sat in the ocean and talked to other people from that resort. We were pleased we chose Hacienda...our deal was much better than theirs...food, activities, service.... We have not been to an all-inclusive on land...have taken cruises. My kids loved the activities, but I think this resort is quieter and does not offer as many activities as I have heard others do. My kids participated in all the evening events...casino nigt, mayan night, etc. We took an exursion to Tulum. It was great to see. You book thru the hotel for an additional cost. Be aware, with traffic, the ride is about an hour and a half. NOT 45 minutes as we were told...after the tour and time to walk around in Tulum, we asked our driver to drop us in Playa del Carmen for lunch and shopping. We ate at La Parilla on 6th st at 5th....great food. We then walked back to the Fisherman were we had arranged with the Resort to be picked up. BE AWARE....they tell you it is about 8 blks to get there from this resuarant....not true, it was well-over a mile. Just allow enough time to get back. The food, the staff, the grounds are all wonderful. We would recommend this resort for a fun, relaxing vacation.

They put us in a room close by to kids club and that was great!. So turns out it was better then good!!! Silvia and Andrea were the leaders and treated my daughter so fantasic. They watched kids so carefull around the pool (my child is alomost 4 ) they had activities, pool games, beach games arts and crafts, took them to lunch, ice cream, and much more. They made the parents feel relaxed that you could come check on them anytime of the day. Always left a note to say where they were when out on hotel grounds. Clean friendly, calm, kids club.

So parents if you need the break with kids come to this resort! it so nice to sit on the pool chairs and see your child walking by with a small group of kids and is happy and off to the next special thing to do!.. As for the hotel itself very clean rooms and the beds are fantasic. Staff are really nice and friendly the outdoor pizza place is great. They hold beach parties and really try to impress. The buffet is good but just like you would think of one in mexico. It was fresh food and I was fine with it. The outdoor grill was very nice.

Like everyone else tuned in to TA, my wife and I spent the last few months reading all the exciting reviews and we were very much looking forward to our trip to HTR. Based upon the overwhelming majority of reviews, awards and accolades bestowed upon the property, (by the hotel itself and others) we concluded that our Honeymoon experience at HTR would be a slam dunk success and had little chance of not being an off the hook out of this world positive and rewarding experience. We dismissed all the naysayer timeshare traders griping about the all inclusive fees and those that found the black sea weed at the beach as a problem HTR should be responsible to correct as just complainers who would never be happy anywhere. Well it just goes to show how wrong you can sometimes be. Just because you read it does not mean it\u2019s true. First a little background, to put this all in to a better context. My wife and experienced world travelers and I am a part time travel agent. We have stayed in properties ranging from the standard Motel 6 type to the finest 5 star all inclusive resorts. From our experience, though it may be different for others, we have found that the most important factor in what our ultimate experience ends up being is if the property expectation ultimately is consistent with what you experience in person. In other words, the sizzle, the self serving marketing hype and self serving awards aside, did the property deliver the service and product it claimed it was going to provide? If problems were encountered in real time at the resort, did the resort address the issues and do the right thing on the spot not apologize later. We strongly believe that though there were some positive and unique features not found at any other properties in the Riviera Maya, HTR delivered more sizzle than steak and though they talked the talk, the bottom line is that they are not delivering the product they describe, nor did they make it right or offer a do over to make it right on another visit. Everything listed in this review was either brought to the hotels attention before we arrived or at the time the problem occurred the hotel had ample time to correct. We are holding the bar very high for HTR as after all, for comparative purposes this is a property holding itself out as a five star resort and attempting to command $500 + per day per couple for the experience. As experienced travelers, we took every step possible to ensure the highest likelihood that our honeymoon and ultimate vacation experience had the highest probability to be successful. These steps included but were not limited to contacting in advance Alma Lopez, Director of Sales and Marketing for HTR as well as Mr. Xavier Sierra lead customer service reservation agent to advise them this vacation was our honeymoon and we didn\u2019t want any unpleasant surprises or unexpected issues as well as to go over some basic requirements we needed with respect to having to tend to some \u201cwork\u201d issues during our vacation stays. In addition, we reminded them regularly that we only had one chance to make our honeymoon experience, a most memorable event free of aggravation and upset. We had our expectations in line with what we expected HTR to deliver. We were not looking for a spring break party or high energy experience . For the purpose of this review I will concentrate on the details of what needs immediate correction and major improvement not what appears to be working well. Yes for all those taking notes HTR is a relatively brand new property, it is very clean and modern, nice pool and rustic natural beach area with beachside poster beds, and the culinary experience , though there is some room for improvement , for an all inclusive resort is outstanding. (I think they try to clean the black seaweed on the right side of the beach 24 x 7.) Our honeymoon trip started off just fine. Our flight arrived on time, and we were met on time by the Sunset tours transfer arranged by the hotel. Unfortunately, after that point it started to go down hill. I hope that for the next few months at the very least I do not hear the phrase Lo siento, perdoname! (lo see-en-to, purr-dOh-nah-may) I am sorry please forgive me , as this became the most common phrase uttered throughout our stay. All of the staff are well trained to apologize, show remorse and contrition and try to satisfy the guests, but unfortunately few if any are empowered to actually l deploy effective solutions or authorized to make compensation or corrective decisions. 1-When we checked in at exactly the time HTR scheduled us to be picked up and arrive at the hotel and were told no rooms available at this time ( Though we went to great lengths to pre-coordinate our early landing at the property as we had \u201cwork\u201d issues to attend to -This debacle alone may have cost us far more than the total cost of the vacation-yes we know what time the official check in time is. ) 2-When we were told that they really had no desk or work area in the room to be able to conduct business or set up a computer . It was not our intention to have to work on our honeymoon but you do what you have to. (They did finally find an outdoor plastic table and by the way the telephone did not work when we checked in to the room. Had to walk back the length of a football field to the front desk to advise ) 3-When we went back to see \u201cLetty\u201d in concierge for the third time to hear about our scheduled welcome consultation and review of the property only to find she was busy with other \u201cappointments\u201d . (later we figured out she is the first line of offense in manipulating you to attend and purchase a time share or private residence club as they refer to it as. Yes, we did get transfers and a Tulum and Xel Ha, but should have received three times the compensation since they took up three times as much of our time as promised and then when we were interested, a very cursory review of the contract presented uncovered what was tantamount to a fraudulent sales presentation-shameless! ) 4-When the attorney for the Sunset Group apologized that the promises and offers made in the time share presentation were omitted or not written in the contract form as stated in the presentation made by the sales person (s). Doesn\u2019t HTR recognize that the treatment outlined here on TA time and time again by the folks over in the timeshare division reflects poorly on the HTR experience on the whole ? Don\u2019t they get it? 5-When we waited for the \u201cferry\u201d to Cozummel in Playa Del Carmen for one and a half hours because apparently the concierge staff does not have accurate timetable information. (This is basic information that a cracker jack concierge staff should have) 6- When we checked back in to the hotel again upon returning from Cozumel only to go through the same exact experience again with a room not being ready DESPITE the assurances and reassurances of Pablo at the front desk who promised this would not happen again after our rough landing earlier in the week. (only 66% occupancy and the front desk unable to find anything but 2 double beds on short notice-would not consider an upgraded room-sorry that\u2019s not acceptable and when asked for an immediate resolution and to find a nice room Pablo commented that he did not have that authority only a \u201cmanager\u201d could do that. ) 7-When we were told by the concierge staff 5 minutes before our \u201cspecial dinner\u201d that unfortunately chef Oscar could not provide the special dinner requested (crab legs) although we had ordered 48 hours earlier and reconfirmed 2 hours before dinner that all was in order and assured \u201cchef Oscar had taken care of everything, not to worry, this is HTR\u201d (chuckle) 8 -When the bellhop forgot to show up as scheduled to bring our luggage to the lobby the first and second time . 9- When our \u201creal rib eye steak\u201d special ordered at the Hacinda grill turned out to look more like a wafer thin tortilla or pancake despite the assurances of Chef Oscar that he took care of it. (Morton\u2019s or Ruth\u2019s Chris quality or size not expected but if a real steak is not available then just say so\u2026.) 10-When the wait staff could to be found to bring a drink to the pool area or forgot to return with the drink as ordered on more than 3 occasions . 11-When the room service promised to return with the milk for the coffee in \u201ccinco minutos\u201d only for it become \u201cuno hora y media \u201d and still no milk. Get it right the first time! 12- When we found out there was No Captain Morgan Rum or any spiced rum for that matter- Come on, they promised that if there was something you wanted and it was missing they would get it if it was reasonable . After all, this was supposed to be a top shelf All Inclusive . It was not like we were asking for some obscure expensive cognac. If Chef Oscar can get the little kid marshmallows I am sure he can find some spiced rum for Dad. This should be our biggest problem in life. 13-When we had no hot water to take a shower 4pm on a Sunday (They sent a man to \u201crepair\u201d but all he did was run the water and it still was not hot\u2026yep you guessed it \u2026.Lo siento, perdoname! 14-When the Wifi and \u201cIce system\u201d (touch screen customer service portal) worked sporadic at best but most often just not working. 15-When upon visiting the Spa and Sauna Area we experienced basically a desolate area with few if any comers for services that looked to be priced at a level for a 10 star resort . We went to use the Sauna and steam room and asked for a robe only to be told they didn\u2019t have any or she did not know where to look. 16-When it was apparent that rose petals and a towel swan was the \u201choneymoon\u201d part of the resort experience . We don\u2019t think this transformed HTR in to a Honeymoon resort or newlywed vacation. Perhaps a welcome greeting, an opportunity to meet other honeymooners, a newlywed activity or even an attempt to form an activity or possibly even the waiter mentioning congrats or the like at any meal? Sorry they did offer a $200? Honeymoon dinner on the beach? I\u2019ll stop here but this list is by no means complete and could go on and on..Hopefully the point should come across by now that the problems outlined here cover the total gamut of the complete organization from sales, to check in, to food and beverage, to customer service and concierge, to maintenance to marketing and time share area. It was not one isolated area or problem nor was it any one particular time. It was a consistent inconsistency of service throughout our stay. Our conclusion is that essentially HTR is a work in progress as this is a property where one hand does not talk to the other or perhaps may only be ultimately concerned in selling timeshares . There does not appear to be a common goal or objective, personality or pulse other than to have an opportunity to promise a 90 minute timeshare presentation, deliver a four hour one and then don\u2019t even seal the deal in a written contract (those reviews are deplorable) Instead of working as a cohesive team unit each link in the chain does not communicate with the other . There is apparently a lack of managerial control or oversight which is unacceptable for a property that holds itself out as an upscale premium level experience. Theses are not problems that will go away with David Z Cancun\u2019s canned replies and apologies (Is he a real person?) and if HTR does not get the act together soon enough the deals on SkyAuction and the 2 for 1 vacation offers will not make the problems go away. The folks over in the timeshare area made it very clear. \u201cif you don\u2019t buy here today you will NEVER be allowed to come back and stay at HTR again. \u201c Maybe that\u2019s true? I would like to end on a positive note if that is at all possible. The property is for the most part pristine, well kept and a great majority of the staff are hard working, aim to please and seem genuinely happy working at the resort . A great place for rest and relaxation The beach just to the north end of the property is as beautiful as it gets and the cenotes emptying in to the Caribbean are a National Geographic unforgettable picture. Mostly everything they say about Chef Oscar is true . He is certainly to HTR what Mickey is to Disney and Shamu is to Sea World. If you could only clone him and bottle his smile and spark in his step as he tirelessly looks to genuinely make the guests feel welcome and fulfill their request s many of HTR\u2019s issues would disappear immediately . (Invest in some real steak knives Oscar!) In addition, I would like to make a special note to acknowledge Angelica who went out of her way to give my wife and I a special tour of the property while we spent more time waiting for \u201cLetty\u201d . Unfortunately Angelica twisted her ankle on the tour and we did not get to see her again. We wish her a speedy recovery . Hector\u2026you also deserve special recognition as you were very helpful on a number of occasions as well as Emanuel who just loves to bring luggage to your room with a smile .. The problems at this property, are correctable and I am confident that perhaps in due time they will be , albeit we have been part of HTR\u2019s learning process and we did not have the opportunity to experience a 5 star experience and shame on us we only get one chance to receive a first impression and have a honeymoon at HTR. In all fairness we admit we did get a lot of rest and relaxation, loved most of the culinary experience but despite the assurances we received most of issues were never resolved to our satisfaction and all we received on the way out was another Lo siento, perdoname! Since then , yes HTR has been in touch . We received a promotional email inviting us back to the resort in May for $700+ per night to do it again\u2026.Are they serious? We are waiting for the follow up from guest relations or other marketing partners but we won\u2019t hold our breath. Apologies are offered freely and unlimited but little more is extended to unhappy guests . If you are looking to get away for a little rest and relaxation, and you can book this property for a nominal amount then go for it, you have made a fine choice, but don\u2019t set the bar too high or you may be very disappointed.", "Date": "March 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London Canada", "Title": "\u201cHit and Miss\u201d", "Author": "wickman11", "ReviewID": "UR59409428", "Content": "40 minute wait for check-in. the people in front of us were bumped and moved to a different resort. Very upset. They seemed very disorganized at check-in. Got to our room: no phone, no furniture on the patio, no shower head, no service screen for internet etc., no bedding for sofa-bed. Nailed down a maid in the hallway and she brought bedding as requested. It was late so we didn't say anything. Next day we pointed out all the missed items and our dissappointment. They apologized but didn't provide a new room till the next day, so 2 of our 6 nights were in an unfinished room. The time share guy sympathized and said we should not have been sold that room - no kidding. Resort grounds are immaculate though a bit of a maze. No direct route - though the layout was great. 2 \"upper pools\" for adults and 1 beach front pool for families. pools were spectacular and no problem getting loungers even though the resort was full. It never seemed crowded. Food was outstanding. This is our 6th AI resort and this food and service was the best anywhere. Beach was not nice. I only saw a handful of people in the water all week, which was dissapointing. The nature tours were great, snorkeling in the Cenotes and kayaking were fun - kids really enjoyed this and sailing. Minimal activities - even though they publish a list of activities and times, no one ever took charge and put an event together (volleyball was sporatic and soccer was non-existent even though they were on the schedule). The sports bar was odd - no NCAA on the tv's even though it was tournament time. the atmosphere of this bar was just wierd. The website for this place is terrible. The site should state everything the traveller needs to know before they travel. We were not aware of the \"pants for men\" rule. I was denied at the Italian restaurant despite being dressed in nice walking shorts and a button down shirt. The dude in front of me was in grubby jeans and a trucker T shirt but he got in. Brutal.

Upon checking in, we immediately noticed several people at the front desk drinking what looked like fruit juice cocktails and beer. We thought we would be offered a welcome drink, but were not. Not a big deal, maybe they got them elsewhere. However, later in the week we noticed the juice service set up on the front table in the lobby. No one ever came around to offer you a drink -- you had to go see them instead. This would be the norm throughout the rest of our trip. After finding out that our room was not ready yet, we were asked to sit down in the lobby and wait for the concierge to \"welcome\" us. As it turns out, this was really a pitch to get you to take the timeshare tour. Before we even had seen our room or the resort, this is the first impression that they give. Luckily, we had read about these practices beforehand and had decided before checking in that we would pass on their offer. They did offer \"a $400 value\" in services, but we stood firm and declined. After the presentation, we were given our room key, and the front desk worker told us that our travel agent requested no wrist bands for the week. We thought that was odd since we used a well-known Internet site, but didn't think much of it at the time. Our room was very nice - just like the pictures and kept clean all week. I paid special attention to the workmanship of the room since they claim to be a 5-star resort, but found it to be comparable to others we've stayed in while in Mexico. Nice, but not extravagant. The jacuzzi tub on our balcony worked fine, as did the in-room computer (for the most part). The computer is a fun toy to have (it functions much like an iPhone I would say), but definitely not a necessity. Especially since whenever we wanted to use it to order a service (one time for housekeeping, twice for room service), it didn't place the order. Still, it is helpful for checking out dining menus ahead of time, and can also be used to get onto the Internet (for free). Based on the investment they made in this technology, I do think it could have been better, such as having information on the town, directions, etc. I'm not sure if they offer non- all-inclusive plans, but they have prices on the menus as if they do. We did not see anyone paying for meals however. If you are thinking of a plan without meals, be aware that the prices are outrageous. It would have been nearly $100 US for a basic lunch for two and twice that for a nice dinner. The number of people taking part in the timeshare tours was crazy. As we sat by the pool on any given day, we saw a group go by every 20 minutes during most mid-day hours. Throughout the trip, we felt as though the time share prospects were more of the \"haves\" and we were the \"have-nots\" as it was very obvious that a bigger effort was made to impress them throughout the week versus us \"regulars\". We weren't wearing bands while the rest of them were, which is how we assumed the servers know your status. For example, we saw two different groups dining with timeshare salesmen one night in the Mexican restaurant, and both were offered steak and lobster, which was not on the menu, while we were not. We read on Trip Advisor that you can order items that are not on the menu, but no one went out of their way to tell us that like they did at the timeshare tables. It just seems like every effort is made to impress the prospects, while the rest of the guests are just \"average\". We paid a lot of money to stay at HTR and did not think this was fair. Another example of catering to the \"VIP's\" was that there was a wedding on Saturday night while we were there. While this is no big deal to us, they shut down the sports bar (for a large portion of the evening) and the outside restaurant to the rest of the guests. Without the sports bar open, there is almost nothing to do at night, not even anywhere to get a drink after 10:30 pm when the bar in the Mexican restaurant closes. We thought they could have made other accommodations for the guests that were not part of the wedding. Service by the pool was very spotty. Sometimes they would ask if you wanted a drink, most times they would just walk right by and purposely avoid eye contact with you as to avoid having to take your order. One time our lunch order was completely forgotten, and the waiter told us one hour later that he simply forgot. The pools are kept very nice and don't seem to get much use. It was relatively easy to get a chair...some people play the \"towel game\" but not many. The beach is as everyone describes - seaweed/mangrove roots on the sand and dirty brown water. Workers were out there every day all day long cleaning it up (seems like a losing battle). But we knew this ahead of time from reading reviews here, so it wasn't a big deal. The rivers were more interesting to us, since they are different from most other resorts. While they have various guided tours (kayaking, snorkeling), they don't really advertise the fact that you can do these on your own at any time you want. We constantly had to prompt our guide for more information, as she always gave out as little as possible. For example, we took a group bike tour, and we were with a group much slower than us. The guide noticed that we were bored and said that we could take the bikes on our own some other time. However, I had to prompt for more information such as \"where do you get the bikes?\" and \"when can you get them?\". The exact same thing happened when kayaking as well. We felt as though they didn't advertise their nature activities to the maximum extent considering that it really sets them apart. The sports bar was the only place to go after 10:00pm, and even then on some nights it was completely dead. There just isn't much going on at this place. A few nights they did have shows (fire show, Mayan show, Canadian Idol winner played for us), but none of these were very heavily attended. The fire show was of very good quality though. Two of the activities directors (Tony and Andy) made good efforts to get people involved (volleyball during the day, dancing in the bar at night). In fact, they seemed like the two happiest people at the resort. A visit to a nightclub in PDC was also set up and attended by them one night. It's just that most people don't take part in these things. Regarding the head chef, Oscar, he is as good as everyone else says. We saw him every day around all parts of the resort. When he was around, the service improved. It was obvious that all of the other workers put much more effort in when he was watching. The food was good in all of the restaurants; the buffet was just average. Overall, we picked this place because of prior good reviews on Trip Advisor, but based on current reviews and our own experience, this place seems to be going downhill fast. Had we not visited other resorts in the past, we might have had a better rating of HTR, but knowing what else is out there for the price, this place is just average.", "Date": "March 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "allentown, pa", "Title": "\u201cI'll try to be accurate, honest, and objective.\u201d", "Author": "comicmasters", "ReviewID": "UR59354158", "Content": "I like using tripadvisor to get as much info as possible about a resort to choose the best vacation for my family. So if you're doing the same, here goes. 1. Even though this is an All Inclusive club, expect to tip. You get some pretty good pressure, it's never said, but boy are they working for it, sometimes overtly. 2. The workers are all very friendly. 3. No map of the grounds so you're going to have to struggle slightly to figure the place out. I'll tell you that for 326 acres, it's a pretty small place. 4. 24 hour room service was pretty good and punctual. 5. The Food. Of all the meals Kytori was the best. After that it wasnt anything to write home about. 2 inside restaurants not including the buffet. 1 poolside restaurant. And 1 brick oven for pizza restaurant. 6. And if you like lobster you have to inform the resort 24 hours in advance of when you want it. I was disappointed of this because I told my son he could have it every day if he wanted. II'm letting you know that because I was never told that. If you want lobster for dinner, order it now. 7. I have 3 kids that are a little older 11,12, and 15. They kind of fall through the cracks at a resort such as this. They have a kids club, but it's for little kids 6 & under. Now we can entertain ourselves and we did, but when you consider the options provided by a Palace Resort, it was disappointing. We took the cenote eco-tour which we recommend, and we took the bike tour which we enjoyed(bikes need some work though). They had a Mayan show which the kids enjoyed. Gambling night with fake money was fun. Rented a car to get away from the resort and went to Tulum and Tulum beach which was awesome. Went to xcaret which was a good time. 8. If you don't need a nice beach, then you might be ok. The courtyard is beautiful. You can be lazy at the pool all day long and enjoy youself just fine, especially if you can entertain yourself. 9. If you need a beach that is picturesque and is what comes to mind when you think of the Mayan Riveria, you will not like it here. We stayed 4 days, and not one person went in that water. And I like to swim at the beach as do my 3 kids. 10. I booked this trip through luxury link which had built into it several very nice additions such as a private moonlight dinner, massages, special breakfast in room, and jacuzzi rose petal room preparation upon arrival. - I had to inform the resort of all of these while they were trying to get me to go to the private residence seminar upon arrival which is their timeshare. I was told all would be taken care of. The last thing you want to get hit with is the timeshare spiel before you have a chance to eat or get your room. However, to be fair, that is commonplace of not only this resort but many in Mexico. - We did not get a jacuzzi rose petal room preparation upon arrival. - Massages were great, spa facility private and seemed on par with a nice resort. - Private moonlight dinner was awesome (thank you Hector), this saved the trip for me as it was my 20th wedding anniversary. - However, as soon as something nice would happen....they forgot to give us our special in room breakfast when we asked for it. Picture yourself waiting in your room for a breakfast that isnt coming when there are restaurants right below you. I'll tell you, you feel stupid. After telling our personal Concierge of the oversight she passed me off to the girl who set it up. This girl as nice as she was said she could set up another breakfast or send a special gift to the room. I said out of the two choices, send something to the room then. It never came. We shielded our kids from the shortcummings of the resort and all in all they had a fantastic time as did my wife and I. But, when you take a vacation such as this you like to be treated like royalty. The missteps made by this resort made me look bad in front of my family on more than one occasion. And that is unacceptable for a resort that you are essentially spending a $1,000 a day on(after airfare). I can in good conscience tell you that if you are looking for the royal treatment, you and your family will be better served by investigating other options.

I will begin by giving this property 8 stars out of a possible10. The H3R could become a 10 with some simple process improvements of which I\u2019ll describe below: Dining There are several dining options throughout the property. The Hacienda Grill (9 out of 10) is a full service, outdoor restaurant by the pool. The service was top notch and the menu had a good selection so we weren\u2019t bored with the offerings. If you request lobster one day prior to dining in this facility for an evening meal, it will be grilled to perfection the next night. I had the grouper and a chicken kebob on two other occasions, both of which were excellent. In the evening, Kenny G.\u2019s Latino cousin provides saxophone entertainment to prerecorded Rat Pack tracks with a sprinkle of Stevie Wonder and Bette Midler. The servers here are on top of their game and provide a pleasant experience. At Il Forno Pizzeria (8 out of 10) you can get a quick, brick-oven pizza in about 5 minutes or less. At this outdoor restaurant near the pool, there are a few options for pizza and calzones available, but they can make you just about any off-menu pizza/calzone you\u2019d like. Be wary of the Italian sausage pizza. It\u2019s basically a cheese pizza with hot dogs. Ack! They also serve beer which is great while you wait out that painful 5 minutes for your pie. I only ate at El Alebrije (4 out of 10) for lunch one day because we were tired of the Casa Las Islas buffet. The selection is limited and somewhat bland. It\u2019s convenient because there is a full bar in the facility (oh, and don\u2019t by shy to ask for a tequila sampling) and the \u201cbrown\u201d margaritas are tasty. The lunch buffet had fish, steak and chicken spirals with some corn and rice. The cilantro soup was good, but we stayed away from the salad bar. It included hot dog salad. Weird. Don\u2019t try to eat here for breakfast because it if for timeshare converts only. Lunch starts around 12:30 p.m. I rated it low because of the poor selection on the buffet and the hot dog salad. Casa Las Islas (6 out of 10) is a standard buffet near the main lobby. After you eat here a couple of times you\u2019ll be tired of the limited selection. Breakfast always includes an omelet bar, a yogurt station, a bread/pastries area, some cereal and then a grouping of random hot foods, which include: bacon, link sausage (not hot dogs), wheat pancakes with 4 kinds of syrup, waffles, chicken, turkey, fish, and refried beans. There are also fresh fruits, cheeses and oatmeal. The service was prompt, but be prepared to wait for a seat if you show up late or have a large party if the resort is full. Honestly, the food was good, just reparative. There is a bar in the restaurant so you can get your Bloody Mary, mimosa, beer or whatever you can stomach at 8 a.m. Lunch is a little better. The staples there seem to be chicken nuggets and French fries along with a small pasta bar replacing the omelet station. Same goes for dinner. As always, the service is outstanding. I would rate this higher, but my stomach gets a little queasy just thinking about eating there again. If you\u2019ve ever done the cabbage soup diet in your life, it\u2019s like how the soup makes you feel on the 5th day. I am not sure why I thought I\u2019d enjoy Asian food in Playa del Carmen, and Kotori (4 out of 10) reinforced my mindset. It\u2019s only open for dinner on certain days of the week and is also just off the lobby. I had various appetizers including sushi and spring rolls. The spring rolls were OK. But my entr\u00e9e which was beef and noodles looked disgusting and tasted disgusting. My servers, Gustavo (he\u2019s amazing!) and Geronimo (he\u2019s pretty good!), kept the food and drinks coming. Since the beef and noodles was inedible, he brought me some tempura seafood which turned out to be shrimp, salmon and cod deep fried in Bisquik and honey. Not good either. I say skip it all together, but if you do, you\u2019ll miss out on Kenny G.\u2019s other Latino cousin providing inspirational flute entertainment. On the days that the restaurant isn\u2019t disguised as Kotori, it becomes Porto Bello (9 out of 10). I suppose Mexicans can do Italian properly. I had waaaaaaaaaaaaay too much to drink during the day and opted for Grandma\u2019s Pasta which was just spaghetti and marinara. There were several appetizers to choose from including a goat cheese salad and raw tuna. Gustavo and Geronimo were taking care of us again, so it made it even better. Some others in my party had the veal and/or beef medallions and just loved them. This on is worth a visit, and if you\u2019re lucky, Kenny G.\u2019s Latino cousin-once-removed will entertain you with his Pavarotti-like vocal stylings. He is a little pitchy (dawg!) and likes to hang on to some of his notes for about 30-seconds of sustained vibrato. Finally there is the Victory Sports Bar (6 out of 10) which shouldn\u2019t really be called a sports bar at all. That\u2019s unless you think pool, bingo and Jenga qualify as sports in your book. It is, if anything, a good bar which has prompt service. I highly recommend Carlos in this facility. He rocks! There are about five 32\u201d TVs mounted on the walls and none of them carried the NCAA tournament which started this week. Turn out the only have cable service (no satellite) so we were stuck watching Iron Man, Hispanic music videos and futbol. This room also serves as the registration area on check in days (horrible process, by the way) and the concert facility for local favorite, Melissa. Only 12 people showed up for her performance on Monday night, so either she sucks or H3R doesn\u2019t advertise well. This is a fine place to hang out when it\u2019s raining or if you get the itch to play Jenga. If you choose to use Room Service (8 out of 10), you really can\u2019t go wrong. They\u2019re open 24 hours a day and will make whatever you want. If you use the ICE computer in your room or call it in, give yourself a 15-30 minute buffer. We used it two or three times and each time the delivery came later than when we asked for it. It\u2019s also nice to be able to eat in your room. Strangely, they\u2019ve never heard of peanut butter so you\u2019re not getting any of that with your toast, buddy boy! And don\u2019t forget to tip a couple of bucks for the effort. Recreation We used a kayak from the cenotes end, up the river to the beginning and back. It was about a half mile each way. You can also rent a Hobie cat and do some quick sailing in the ocean. Whoever was working the recreation table on the beach was on a prolonged break or something so we just took one. It was good times and the water was so clear. You\u2019ll need bio-degradable sunscreen and mosquito repellant to partake. And even when the staff tells you there aren\u2019t any mosquitoes (it\u2019s too cold, there aren\u2019t any here, wrong season for mosquitoes, etc.), believe me, there are! And they love to bit Americans and Canadians. Drink as much as you can beforehand so at least the critters will die a little happier before you slap them into a bloody speckle. Do the snorkel tour, as well. It\u2019s a self-paced swim with the cenote current. Lots of fish to be discovered and branches to smack you when you\u2019re not paying attention. Oh, and the water was co-oh-old! Chilly willy, but worth it. The botanical tour isn\u2019t very interesting (but I was drunk and wanted to swim) and doesn\u2019t take too long prior to the swim. If you can find a willing and competent member of the concierge staff (I couldn\u2019t) they will set you up for the excursion. The concierge is basically worthless. Anyone in the lobby or sits behind a desk are worthless. They tell you to go somewhere else for information that they should have readily available. A person we traveled with got so fed up with them that he put a dead fish in their trashcan because they couldn\u2019t figure out a way to have one of the chef\u2019s cook it for him for dinner after a deep sea fishing excursion. They don\u2019t know anything about area excursions or tours in Playa del Carmen or in Cancun. They blow. Oh, and the bell staff dress like pirates so it was somewhat fun for me to yell \"Arrrrrrrrggggggggghhhh!\" everytime I saw one. We spent most of the time at the family pool even though we didn\u2019t bring kids. It\u2019s closer to the satellite bar, the beach, hot tubs and these amazing wicker couches to lay out on. The beach is small but nice. The crew is cleaning out a lot of the nasty seaweed so it\u2019s a prettier beach. You can walk out on the pier and can see Cozumel on the horizon. You can also walk down the beach to the neighboring resorts. They\u2019re massive, packed full of people and nowhere near as nice as the H3R. Accommodations and Service The rooms are some of the best I\u2019ve ever stayed in while in Mexico. From bed comfort to water pressure, you will not be disappointed. Housekeeping was excellent with cleaning and turndown service. The TV has HBO and (my favorite) the American Network which was basically CBS/Viacom programming. ABC also has a channel. There is a DVD player in the room and we brought a few episodes of Dexter and a Netflix movie to watch. Worked like a charm. There are multiple inputs on the flat screen TV so you can hook whatever you\u2019d like up the TV. The ICE computer is a little bit fickle. It\u2019s touch screen and I had to unplug it a few times so it would reboot to get it to work. Overall, I like the technology integration. Too bad they don\u2019t have technology for a lot of other systems. The armband system for all-inclusive plans is somewhat painful. Be prepared to give everyone on the staff you deal with your room number. Check-in was disorganized. Upon arrival we went to the Victory Bar and sat around. There was no one available to explain the process, they just brought drinks and some light appetizers. After several drinks, most people didn\u2019t care about the disorganization. Inebriation was an effective Band-Aid, but why not fix the process so the guest\u2019s sense of arrival is phenomenal? It didn\u2019t ruin the trip. I would have to say that the service in every area except for the front desk and concierge is amazing. There is an executive chef named Oscar who you\u2019d think was a local celebrity who is omnipresent. He seemed to be extremely effective at making things happen. I never met the owner or GM of the property, but employees hopped when Oscar gave an order. I wound up going to him whenever I needed something because he had the ability (and motivation) to make things happen while others either made excuses or said \u201cno\u201d. This resort could use a few more Oscars in the lobby! Spa Be careful! I was at the H3R with 12 other people and more than half were charged something different than they were quoted from the spa staff. Curiously, when confronted about the discrepancy, the spa employee was nowhere to be found. Also, make sure they don\u2019t accept your reservation on a Post It note. If they do, then that\u2019s the same as not having a reservation. The staff is highly unapologetic and indifferent to your dilemma. While relaxing, the spa services are overpriced so be sure to haggle and get the best deal available. The steam room and exercise equipment were nice, however, my wife and I couldn't sit in the steam room for long because we kept getting hit with little scalding meteorites from the ceiling. Other I have heard a lot of people mention that the timeshare folks are pushy and aggressive. Although I wasn\u2019t interested, not one timeshare employee approached me the whole week I was there. I kind of felt like the last kid picked on a baseball team except that I didn\u2019t get picked and didn\u2019t want to get picked. The weather was great, the bar service was great (don\u2019t forget to tip a little for even faster service!) and I didn\u2019t think about work once. The transportation to and from H3R is ridiculously expensive, so I don\u2019t have any good ideas for you there. We had a group of 13 so we split two vans at $10 a person. To travel one way as a couple, it\u2019s $80. There must be a better way. Some of the nightly shows were entertaining (Mayan dance, Caribbean party, Fire show) and it was nice to see some organization to it. The Latin American Idol and Canadian Idol were there for a performance one night. Not very many people showed up and it wasn\u2019t very impressive. Again, like Melissa, it sucked or wasn\u2019t advertised well. Nevertheless, I am home now and sifting through nine inches of snow wishing I was back on the Mayan Rivera working on my sunburn. H3R is a great place and I am very critical, so I hope you enjoy your trip as much as I did.

We were given a week at a timeshare as a gift from a friend. We added a few extra days and tried out the cabana on the beach approach in Tulum (Hotel Nueva Vida). We LOVED the beach cabana. By comparison going from cabana to the Tres Rios was like checking into a hospital. Don't get me wrong the place is clean and the grounds are beautiful well kept and certainly very new. However, it felt sterile and very much like an institution, not my idea of a vacation resort. Because we were a guest of a timeshare owner we were \"marked.\" As soon as we arrived we were \"captives.\" Herded into a room and forced to wait and go thru three different people who overloaded us with information and wanted decisions. The main one, of course, being when wanted to schedule our personal tour and timeshare pitch! We wanted none of that. Made that clear. But they don't want to hear that of course. The biggest \"gottcha\" is that you can stay at this place without the all inclusive plan, which is what we booked. We had a car and planned to spend a bit of time in Playa and figured there was no way would would consume $150 a day per person in food--which is what it would cost to upgrade to the AI plan. We did think we would buy a few meals on site... ah... but here is the \"gottcha\" --the buffet prices: breakfast $30, lunch $40, dinner $50 per person. You gotta be kidding! Oh you could order during the day at the snack bars for like $15 for a hamburger, one of the cheapest things on the menu. (The eyes of the person checking us in actually registered disappointment when we informed her we had a rental car... without that you really would not have much choice!) One of the reasons we like to vacation in this area is because of the beautiful beaches and oceans... forget that at Tres Rios. This is a resort built on what is basically a swamp. Yes it is a pretty area, and yes there are lovely things to see and do here. But you are in the Caribbean, if I want swamp I will vacation in the Everglades! The ocean is not really swimmable, has lots of brown stuff floating in it. Since rivers converge here, there is a distinctive odor that I associate with stagnate water. Yuck The rooms were nice enough, free wireless, nice amenities. After the cabana on the beach we traded for a swamp view room at the Tres Rios. :( The saving grace was that they have some sister resorts where you have privileges--one of those is The Sunset Fisherman in Playa Del Carmen. We went there as soon as we could escape from the check-in hell. We loved the Sunset and immediately began to investigate the possibility of moving to this resort. We checked into the Tres Rios on Saturday and were told we could not be moved until Monday, and then only if there was space available. So we spent the days at the Sunset, and only slept at the Tres Rios. Monday we were told we could switch... but only if we did the Timeshare presentation... so we sighed heavily and endured the two hour ordeal. We moved to the Sunset and enjoyed that property immensely.

I must make special mention of two people at the hotel who made our stay most enjoyable -- Tony in Entertainment and of course Head Chef Oscar. Tony was an ever friendly face ready for a volleyball game, to take you on a tour or to \"hang out\" (our oldest boy who is 19 appreciated having someone around his age to show him around). Even my youngest (who was in Kids Club most of the time) was always asking \"where's Tony?\" because he has such a fun personality. As mentioned in many reviews, Oscar is a terrific personality and a wonderful chef. Our meals, especially in the Italian restaurant, were wonderful. When we introduced ourselves to Oscar (he is ever present in the hotel -- I'm not sure he even sleeps!), and mentioned that he had made a cake for a friend of ours who had visited the hotel that past summer, he took down our information and made a cake for my daughter as well!

All the good things you previously read about Tres Rios is true; great food, top notch rooms, and incredibly friendly staff! Some specifics: Kids Club: Our daugter loved the kids club. The young ladies who ran the club were always smiling and energetic. The club itself is a converted resort room, so nothing too spectacular. I hope management plans to update/expand the club to include and enclosed play area and a miniture water park would be cool. Beach Service: Service in general at the resort was exceptional. However, you never felt completely catered to at the beach. Drink/food service was spotty, often times we had to get our own drinks. Nothing against the servers, the Grill that provides the food is too far from the beach area, and takes quite awhile to get served. Perhaps management can expand to add a snack bar/restroom closer to the beach (perhaps even a swim-up bar at the pool closest to the beach). Pools: The pools were great, always clean and plenty of chairs/lounges to use. Same with the towels, always plentiful. The upper pool is suppose to be an adults only pool, but there were always kids there. No big deal, but they do need to post signs, or reinforce the adults-only theme. Room: The rooms are steller! Can't remember a resort with better rooms, from the design to the towels and sheets! We upgraded to a 1-bedroom, and was lucky enough to get a balcony with a secluded roof deck. There are only 7-8 of these roof decks, so not sure how we got lucky, but loved it! The touch screen for info and room service was not working but no big deal. Spa: The spa is certainly not ready for prime time. It's currently a bunch of converted resort rooms, with no pool/spa/ or real wet/dry sauna. Certainly not worth the $145 for a massage. The resort is currently expanding/builidng the spa area, so once finished should be fine. My wife and I made a spa reservation at the Mandarin Oriental instead and took a cab there ($10). For the $200, we spent 3-4 hours in spa heaven! Food: The food was great as everyone says! My favorite meal was a grilled steak and shrimp with tortialls and quacamole at the outside grill...........with a cervesa! Pure bliss! A shout out to Oscar, such a nice guy who loves what he's doing. Ensures the food you get is top notch and everyone is taken care of. In fact, my 4 year-old was thrilled when one night for dessert, Oscar brought out some bambonies (marshmellows) and charred them at the table! The day before, he asked my daughter what her favorite dessert is, and she said marhsmellows; so the staff went to town and purchased some for her! Very cool!

Exceptionally clean and comfortable with a lovely view of the ocean and grounds. They have a touch screen system for ordering room service, etc that Francisco explained was not working correctly, but in no way hindered our stay--the phone worked just fine! Housekeeping was consistent, efficient and timely. The food was outstanding. I'm not quite sure where some of these other travelers that did not like the food were eating but it definitely wasn't the same place we were! Chef Oscar Orbe has created a menu throughout the resort that touches on every taste imaginable. The presentation was impeccable and the taste outstanding. Samuel, who I presume is a restaurant manager, was at every meal we had and made sure everything was perfect. We didn't even need menus after a few days because he sent out what he thought we would like and he was always spot on. For lighter fare or more \"Americanized\" food, there was the Hacienda Grill and Pizza Bar. We ate here during the day and the staff were wonderful--especially Jorge at the Pizza Bar. When we were hanging out on our beach beds on the ocean, Angelica was our server and she was friendly, funny and really made our stay enjoyable. And, 24 hour room service....wow! Never a time when there wasn't food or drink available. The activities are great (and included). We did the Jaguar tour which involved snorkeling down the cenotes and kayaking. Our tour guide, Andy, was great. He was well versed on the property and fun to be around. This was one of the highlights of my stay there. Nightlife activities included Casino Night, Karaoke and Fire shows. Tony, Miguel and Gina were all on hand for these events and made the experience even better. We spent a lot of time in the Victory Sports Bar where we had excellent service (and fun to hang out with) people--Martin and Gabriel, to name a couple. Again, I can't emphasize how great the staff is here. I asked if there was something in the water because I have never stayed somewhere where ALL of the staff seems genuinely happy to have you there. Make sure you tip the staff. Although the \"All Inclusive\" says tips are included, do yourself (and the amazing staff) a favor and TIP!! The spa was nice--my sister and I both had a treatment done. The prices are a bit more than what we would generally pay in Seattle, but it was a moot point considering where we were! It was well worth it. As for the time share sales push--it is intense--but I only had to tell the concierge one time that I was not interested in pursuing that and was left alone. I think if you just go down when they call you and do not accept any of their \"freebies\" you will be fine--just remember that this is your trip and going to the presentation is not \"required\" for your stay.

We have been to Royal Hideaway 9 times, Secrets Capri twice, and the Royal in Cancun once (as well as 3 visits to a wonderful non-all-inclusive, Le Meridien Cancun). All three of these all-inclusives are certainly recognized as among the finest in the Yucatan. Obviously, we love Royal Hideaway!!! This year, given the economy, we opted for something a bit less costly and having done a fair amount of research (primarily on TA) and the availability of some very attractive rates, we opted for HTR. The bottom line: we were definitely not disappointed. While the physical plant is certainly attractive and well maintained (albeit not as opulent as the three AI resorts noted above), what really shines is the staff. Without question, they are unfailingly polite, well intentioned and attentive, and all seem dedicated to making your stay as enjoyable as possible. Oscar, the executive chef, has been mentioned in many of the reviews, and nothing that has been written about him is the least bit exaggerated. Not only does he provide top-notch cuisine, but he seems to work 36 hour days and is never, ever without a smile on his face. One morning, we actually saw him bringing an elderly couple\u2019s suitcases into the lobby for check out! It is almost impossible to describe just what he adds to the experience. Frankly, knowing that he would be here would be reason enough to return! The assistant food and beverage manager, Samuel, was also omnipresent and never less than 150% committed to providing guests with the best service. Carlos, a headwaiter, recognized us at almost every dining venue and never failed to treat us as if we were the only guests. We\u2019d also like to single out several servers: Carlos at the pool, Gregorio, \u201cRicky Martin,\u201d Miguel, and so many others who added to our enjoyment. As real foodies, we rated the dining experiences to be among the best we have ever encountered at a resort. If there is one failing that is consistent in the restaurants, it is the less than accurate translations of the dishes into English. If someone is not a fan of sophisticated preparations, I can see where they would not be thrilled with the food, especially if they tried to figure out what some of the dishes are based on the \u201cSpanglish\u201d translations! That being acknowledged, we loved the food and would return solely for that reason. Not to be missed is the 7 course chef\u2019s tasting dinner, personally overseen by Chef Oscar in the brightly lit kitchen area adjacent to the prep station. You are required to purchase a somewhat overpriced bottle of wine, but even with that, it was a major bargain and a wonderful experience. One of the things that continually amazed us was that lack of any sense of feeling crowded. This was the first time we have been at an all inclusive (or for that matter, on a cruise) where we did not have to hurry down to the pool to secure lounge chairs. At no time during our weeklong stay was there ever a crowd by either of the pools or on the beach. even though the hotel was full during the last 4 days. The pools were gorgeous and very well laid out. Echoing several other reviewers, while the beach itself was perfectly fine, the water was not very inviting, generally full of vegetation. For us, it was a non-issue, as we were very happy to spend our days at the pool. There were a few downsides that bear mentioning. In several prior reviews, the heavy handed timeshare sales efforts have been mentioned, and there is no question that they really do push sales. When we checked in, I made it clear that we had no interest in buying and assumed that we would not be contacted. I was wrong \u2013 at 8:45 on the second morning, we did receive a call but declined the presentation. Having spoken to several other guests, it is clear that HTR has one of the most aggressive timeshare sales programs and while I do understand that it is an integral part of their marketing, it really does detract from its goal to be a world class resort. Several couples we met were actually very upset by how they were treated in the whole timeshare sales process. Some people we spoke with were told that if they did not buy now, they would not be able to return next year (as only owners would be welcomed). Others were shown units \u201cjust like the ones that Michael Jordan and the President of Mexico bought.\u201d Obviously, no verification for these claims was available! As we sat around the pool, the primary topic of discussion was who got through the timeshare pitch \u201cunscathed.\u201d We encountered several couples who said they would not return to HTR because of their treatment in the timeshare sales process. In my opinion, it would be a shame if a guest\u2019s lingering memories of their stay was the timeshare interrogation, not the quality of the staff and the facility. My advice to management: Take it down a notch! When a guest says \u201cno,\u201d that should be respected without qualification. Other negatives worth noting: \u00b7 The air conditioning in the room was, at best, erratic. On some days, we could not get the temperature lower than 74 degrees. On others, we awoke to 66 degree temperatures! To the staff\u2019s credit, as a temporary resolution, they brought in a bedside fan when we could not adequately cool down the room. Many thanks to Hector, the very able concierge, for assisting us in this issue. \u00b7 The wi-fi was inconsistent almost every day and absolutely unusable during our last day and a half. To those of us that have businesses or family that rely on our ability to communicate, even during vacations, this is a significant problem. Again, this has been chronicled in several other posts. \u00b7 The \u201cIce\u201d system (touch screen, in-room resort info) did not work for the entire time we were there. \u00b7 As previously noted, the hair dryers in the room are absolutely useless. Be sure to bring your own if you require one. Also, if you have the requisite number of electronic \u201ctoys\u201d that need charging (a couple of cell phones, a laptop, camera, etc.), bring some multiple outlets, as there are not a lot of really accessible outlets in the room. \u00b7 Entertainment and activities are, at best, so-so, and with the lack of the \u201cIce\u201d system, I think that the dispersal of information regarding activities was hampered. \u00b7 Spa treatments are absurdly expensive. 55 minute massages range from $120 - $140. Even the spa Le Meridien in Cancun was significantly less costly. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask about discounts, as there are a variety available. This being acknowledged, the massages my wife and I had were absolutely wonderful. \u00b7 The fitness center is adequate, but unless you are prepared to get up early in the morning, there are no exercise classes or aquatic classes during what could be termed \u201ccivilized\u201d hours! If you are seeking a vacation rife with nightlife, shopping, etc., HTR is probably not the best choice. A cab ride into Playa del Carmen is approximately $25 round trip, so frequent jaunts into town are just not practical. If, on the other hand, you are looking for a place to just relax and recharge, be treated amazingly well, and enjoy really wonderful food and service, there is very little not to like. The graciousness even extended to check out. As we had a late flight, we were able to stay until 2:30, well past the 11:00 check out time. A simple request to Hector at the concierge desk provided us with an empty suite at 2:00 so we could shower and dress prior to leaving. In summary, keep your distance from the time share folks and enjoy a simply wonderful vacation!", "Date": "February 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hiawassee, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cJust what the Doctor ordered !\u201d", "Author": "MountainDude", "ReviewID": "UR55642342", "Content": "My wife and I needed 3 days of peace, pampering and perfection.

Then off to lunch at the grill, great food, great service. Chef Oscar has his staff ready to serve and eager to please. The afternoon on a beach bed, with wonderful service from Angelica. A short stay in the hot-tub and the off to a fantastic oriental experience for dinner. Alfredo was their to greet us and treat us like royalty. Food was extraordinary. After dinner, we headed to the bar in the international buffet, where Trefelio, created the best cappuccino martini my wife had ever tasted. On to the sports bar for Karaoke. Entertainment Director \"Dr. Hector\", has something happening all the time. Senior Samuel, is always there at the restaurants to insure a great experience for all. We loved all the varieties, Italian, Oriental, the Grill, but , my personal favorite is breakfast at the international buffet. Each morning we were greeted with a big smile and \"Buenas Dias \" by Gregorio and had a wonderful selection of items to choose from. During our stay we had numerous conversations with other guests about their stay and other resorts they had visited. While we all agreed that each resort has its pluses and minuses, we discovered one theme about HTR that was re-occurring. The property is just the right size, the location in a 300 acre preserve eco-friendly area is perfect. The rooms, pools and amenities are accessible even when the property is full. The food selection offers something for everyone. And yes they are still working on the beach area, but overall this is a true 5 Star property. The big difference between HTR and any other Maya resort are the PEOPLE !

The best part for us was not having to wait in the stupid reservation line every morning for the speciality restaurants. We just showed up whenever, wherever and had great food! Food: We didn't feel like the buffet food was ever hot. They had a great deal of variety but the warming lights just kept it warm - not steaming. We feel like they need steaming trays under the food. We always found something we liked. Our favorite was Asian night and the Hacienda Grill by the pool. They are EXCELLENT. The upstairs mexican restaurant has steak that melts in your mouth too! Entertainment: The hotel doesn't have a bunch of young staffers running around blowing whistles and making people take shots. It was quiet and relaxing. There were nightly shows - the Fire show is the best. The hotel management is wonderful and very helpful. They treat their staff very well. Each night the waiters would have a team meeting and then put their hands in the middle of a circle and chant to \"pump them up\" before their shift. Please get to know your waiter at the pool, the towel girl, the waiter who serves your food. They are very nice and want to please you. We tipped every day. A dollar goes a long way. What's $50-$75 in weekly tips after you have spent thousands on your trip? You'll get better service and get to practice your spanish. I didn't like the hair dryers in the rooms. Wierd and techno looking and didn't dry very well or fast. I strongly recommend bringing one from home. Extras: Sign up for the bicycle tour of the property. It is easy and informative.

Our room was gorgeous, clean and had very comfortable beds with featherbed toppers. Pillows were great, and you could also choose any type necessary.

Their buffet each day had a variety of food for all tastes . All - a la carte restaurants were also included and did not have to be reserved. Each night, you could try different food, mexican, italian, seafood, steak, or the buffet which was very good. World class iron chef Oscar was always available to speak with or seen walking around resort ensuring everyone received first class service. Wait staff exceptionally efficient and polite. The beach and pool area is very beatiful..daytime activities include daily beach volleyball with Andy, great guy ! bocci ball, soccer , spanish lessons, snorkelling, kayaking, different eco adventure all free as resort has its own eco park. Nightly entertainment included kareoke night, casino, Mayan show, fire show, and more usually run by our favorite people Roberto, Tony and Andy ( they made our experience very memorable). Shopping: Playa Del Carmen is a short taxi ride from resort. Hotel staff always arranged taxi and let us know what it would cost before we left. average $15 u.s. one way. Great shopping in Playa, you get a great Mexican flavour. Great nightlife also, hotel staff chaparoned an excursion to a nightclub and ensured we got back safely to resort in taxi, much appreciated boys!!!

This was a promotion trip that our friends had invited us to. My wife and I travel extensively in Mexico 4-5 times a year. We are ok with our Spanish and can interact with most residents. We found the resort very nice and most people very accomodating. The activities are really cool...from kayaking to sailing, exploring Cenote's and bike riding or just hanging on the beach. We found the pool to be another awesome place to catch sun and have a cerveza. We attended the promotional seminar and even though we were not interested did not think it was high pressure and everyone was polite. We were able to sign for all food and drink and this was included in our package. We were invited to attend the Chef's table and were told that we could pick any bottle of wine on a particular list for 16.00US. My friend and I signed up for ourselves and our spouses, and reiterated the price for the bottle of wine. We verifed that the cost of the wine was once again 16.00US (twice before we picked our bottles). I drink roughly a bottle of wine every night in the US so I was surprised at the offer. It is unusual to find CA wine in Mexico so I was very impressed with the offer! We concluded our selections and the next night attended the Chef's table. The executive chef, Oscar wasgreat, he spent time with us and explained everything he was serving and we had a wonderful time sipping wine and lauging and eating. The rest of our stay was equally enjoyable...until WE CHECKED OUT! My friend and I had arranged transportation in advance and went to check out 15 minutes before our scheduled departure. This is when our enjoyable trip changed.....we both noticed we were charged $150.00US each for our bottles of wine!!!! Of course we questioned the charges and were told that we were never told this. I was in shock, they ushered our concierge (Helen) over to the front desk to rudley reiterate that we were never told this, funny thing is she is not the one who told us this...so why was she in our face? Then another employee came to the front desk (our shuttle had already left) and said she was the one who took our wine order and never told us this! Then proceeded to tell us that employee's would have to pay the difference if we did not pay the tab and they were unable to check us out of the hotel. My friend and I were not very happy, where or how could we come up with such a ridicoulous story! My spanish is not that bad to misunderstand such an offer and the fact both my friend and I heard the exact same offer! We were embarresed and felt like the staff was accusing us of coming up with this ridicolus story to get out of paying for the wine!!!!! No offer was made for the misunderstanding.

It is new, striking and different. It is echo based and and geared towards adventure rather than your standard beach holiday. The beach was not as large as others and the water dirty due to the nearby rivers. The pool areas at the hotel are outstanding and made up for the deficient beach. The pool water temperature was perfect and there were ample chairs and umbrellas around the pool. There were many free tours at the hotel which included Sensorary Experience, bicycle tours, snorkelling, kayaking and swimming in cenates. The type of people there were excellent and we got along with most, making some good friends. Rooms were excellent in all aspects and so was the food quality and variety. Entertainment was provide at night and was perfect Casino Evening, Karoke, Mayan Dancing, Tequila tasting etc. It was there but did not dominate. The \"Time Share Presentation\" was pushed on each guest for the reward of a free trip. This was at least 2 hrs. As owners of a Luxury Junior Suite we feel that we got fair value at $2,200 for a week including all-inclusive versus the open market price of $3,500 if booked as a hotel (10 visits to break even). Our complaints are as follows. The resort is a bit isolated and requires a taxi to get to Playa. A shuttle is included in some of the all-inclusive deals. The beach is not the best but OK. The hairdryers are sub-standard.

Another trip advisor user said about Hacienda Tres Rios: \u201cif you don\u2019t like this place check your pulse\u201d. Well I must agree 100% with that statement because if you\u2019re normal, you won\u2019t want to go back home after spending time at this immaculate resort. Very long review My husband and I decided to go on a couple\u2019s vacation for the first time in many years (and without our 15 month old baby). We were looking for a relaxing and luxurious retreat to make it worth our while and that\u2019s exactly what we got. We are in our early thirties and are both well traveled. I\u2019ve been using tripadvisor.com for years now to avoid making huge vacation mistakes but this is the first time I actually take the time to write a review because I felt like this place deserved one. It\u2019s a pretty long read so I broke it down into a few categories. Rooms The rooms all have ocean view, are pretty big in size, extremely comfortable and rival those of any expensive luxurious hotel around the world. Before this place, I had never heard of all inclusive resorts offering 7 different types of pillows to the guests. There are bathrobes and the alarm clock has an I-pod adapter. There is also a flat screen TV as well as a touch screen monitor on which you can order room service, check out the restaurants and menus or even surf the web for free. Our mini fridge was filled with beer, soda and water and was restocked daily. There is a great turn down service\u2026and if you think you\u2019ve seen nice swan towel creations on vacation before, wait till you see what crazy towel sculptures they come up with daily. Beach The beach is beautiful and decent sized. There are about two dozen beach beds with canopies. We were able to find one on any given day and most importantly at any time of day. They are extremely comfortable and always clean since they seem to change the sheets and pillow covers on them every day. The ocean right in front of the hotel looks murky and dark on windier days and hotel staff explained it was a result of the organic residues left in the ground from the red and white mangroves which used to grow on that beach. Workers clean up the beach daily and we swam in the warm ocean almost every day. It doesn\u2019t get really deep and the bottom is clean. Look at my beach pictures you\u2019ll see people swimming in the ocean. We spent most of our time swimming and tanning where the first two rivers meet the ocean. The water there is much warmer and see-through. If you pick the last beds on the left near the water sports you can swim in the first river while keeping an eye on your things. The 3 rivers There are 3 pristine rivers on the property and the first two are easily accessible. You can reach the third river\u2019s entrance by kayaking in the ocean along the beach. We made it a point to kayak up all three rivers and they\u2019re simply stunning. Once you\u2019re deep in the mangroves, you might need some bug spray while kayaking. We snorkeled down the first two rivers many times during our stay. Because the current gently brings you down to the ocean, you don\u2019t even have to swim while enjoying the different types of fish. These rivers are crystal clear and feel warmer than the ocean. (see river and cenote pics). The pools & Hot tubs The pools are beautiful and huge and have many \u201ctanning islands\u201d on which nobody tans because the water is freeeezzzing! Many Mexican resorts don\u2019t seem to heat their pools in winter and this is a shame because they\u2019re crystal clear and inviting. They were apparently too refreshing for the kids as well because most of them used to end up in the 3 hot tubs on a daily basis which I found kind of ironic. Water sports There were hobie cats and kayaks on the beach. You can kayak up and down the rivers or in the ocean and also snorkel down the rivers. They also have a few canoes to use in the river surrounding the resort. As for other sports, I believe they had pilates classes, bicycle tours, yoga as well as jogging in the morning. I\u2019m pretty sure there was a gym but we were way too busy overindulging in alcohol and food to check it out\u2026 The food We are very picky eaters (my husband is Italian) and we loved the food at Tres Rios. The food was very high quality and there was always something great to eat. Their wood burning oven pizzas are amazing and we never waited more than 15 minutes for them. You can order them from your room or even from the beach beds. Our favourite restaurant was by far the Hacienda grill, where my husband enjoyed rib eye steak almost ever other night until we found out about the lobster tails. You can have rock lobster at any of their restaurants for no additional fees but I believe you have to ask the Ma\u00eetre D one night in advance for it. They don\u2019t advertise it so we found out about the lobster only on our 6th night, almost by accident because our neighbours were eating them\u2026.so you\u2019re welcome ;)! The grouper at the grill was also amazing for supper as well as their stuffed chicken breast at lunch time. The deserts at the Italian restaurant tasted really rich and authentic. The Mexican restaurant was too \u201chigh end\u201d to our taste, probably because we were expecting more of a Taco Bell type of menu. We did enjoy their Mexican welcome party under the stars on Saturday night. Try to do the \u201cchef\u2019s table\u201d special dinner it is really worth it. The meal is included for the chef\u2019s supper but not the wine so it will set you back a minimum of about 65$ for one bottle, but the 7 course refined meal is really worth it. You get to enjoy this meal inside the main kitchen and Oscar, the head chef, explains every dish in detail. (see pictures) Internet In addition to the touch screen monitor on which you can surf the web in your room, there is wi-fi internet access on the resort. You can also catch many neighbouring resorts\u2019 networks. We needed a more stable connection so we unplugged the wireless modem in the room (situated under the night table) and connected our laptop directly to the hotel\u2019s network. Connection was good enough to skype our family every day from the room for free (with video). There were also two laptops in the exit lounge for guests to use and they were always available. Check-in / check-out We arrived at the hotel on a Tuesday afternoon and the check-in went very smoothly. We were then introduced to our \u201cprivate concierge\u201d who explained many interesting aspects of the resort but then proceeded in trying to have us participate in a timeshare presentation. If you can afford to buy property in Mexico, by all means, get informed about the place because they will compensate you for your time by giving you free massages, meals, activities, car rentals and so on. In our case, since we cannot afford to buy property in Mexico at the moment, we respectfully (but firmly) declined. Who wouldn\u2019t want to call this place home\u2026 We opted not to waste the salesperson\u2019s time as well as cutting down on our own precious vacation time so we said no and they never brought it up again. Check-out was a breeze as well (less than 5 minutes). Staff No matter how nice of a property Tres Rios is, it is the staff who ultimately makes it a 5 star resort. Everybody will go out of their way to help you and get you what you need. Our favourite waiter was hands down Carlos; who from the moment he learned we like chocolate dipped strawberries, brought them to us wherever we seemed to be on the resort and sometimes more than once a day! The best margarita award goes to Efrain when he\u2019s at the main restaurant bar, to Cruz at the beach bar, and to our friend Abenamar at the Grill. Nice folks at the entertainment also with Tony, Miguel, Sergio and Andrea. Nightlife / Party Even at full capacity, this resort feels very exclusive because there are less than 300 rooms. Most guests seem to be looking for a calming and relaxing vacation. The average age is also higher than most resorts so this is not the place to come to if you wish to party hard every night. They organize trips to Playa del Carmen a few nights a week for guests who wish to go clubbing downtown. The sports bar at the resort is very family oriented and never turns into a real party. We were probably the youngest couple vacationing there and still managed to have a great time every night with the other guests and the staff, but ultimately we got what we went there for: comfort, peace and quiet.", "Date": "January 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Broomfield, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cSo Relaxing, Gorgeous, and left Stuffed!!\u201d", "Author": "Traveling4Fun_n_Work", "ReviewID": "UR53973857", "Content": "I had the opportunity to stay here for 4 nights after a few business days in Cancun.

Ah, yeah, where do I start? First, I'm a timeshare owner who searches for nice places to stay via a trade through the timeshare. Our search came up with The Hecienda. We said sure, everywhere else we ever stayed was very nice and thought this would be the same, however we decieded not to take the all inclusive ($120.00 per day per person, $240.00 per couple) to only find we we're going to pay that price anyway, and be treated like a redheaded stepchild. The meals were, per person $30.00 for breakfast, $40.00 for lunch and $60.00 for dinner......yes thats $260.00 per couple for food ,and drinks we're extra. The resort is very secluded, so unless you had a rental car and wanted to drive out ever 4 hours on a 1 hour trip to get food, you felt very trapped to purchase there plan or there very high priced meals. No meal especially there's was worth that kind of money, although I do admit the meals were good, it was usually only buffet, there were a few al carte, however they seemed to close down very early. If you did'nt get the all inclusive you'd find it very hard to find a waiter by the pool, and when you did, and ask for a certain beer, it seemed that beer was never available.... you we're brought a cheaper beer while your all inclusive neighbor was brought the beer you just requested. (with the lime). then on several occasions I had to correct the waiters for beer I was charged and never ordered. It was clear to me that there was no free stay with a timeshare trade, that you thought you were promised when purchased (other than an exchange fee). You will still pay the nightly rate through the all inclusive package or the high price of meals if not all inclusive. The beach we so love to see( The Crystal blue water where you can swim and snorkel) is not at this location. the water is very dirty, and lots of stuff floating around. No one I saw was ever swimming in it, only at the pool! The moat around the resort had an oder, all the time. The water was clear yet smelled. The rooms we're very clean, and the beds were very comfortable, I can't say anything bad about the accomodations other than the hairdryers suck, so bring your own, and the toilet room has no fan, and an open vent in the door, so turn the TV up loud or make others leave the room if you have business to do. Oh yeah, it's an eco park also, so the fridges in the rooms are not cold. Have to save electricity! Every beer I had during my stay was warm,(at around $6.00 per warm beer) since I was not all inclusive, however if you were the warm beer was free. I hate to say anything bad about anyplace, however when you work hard and want to get away and forget about everything for a week, enjoy yourself with no stress or worrys, maybe you should look somewhere else.", "Date": "January 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful, Relaxing Stay with Amazing Food\u201d", "Author": "wendy4810", "ReviewID": "UR53869895", "Content": "Wow, what a great trip.

At breakfast in the Mexican restaurant, tortillas were being prepared right in front of us from a batch of fresh dough, pressed on an small cast iron tortilla press and then thrown in a skillet with toppings we chose added. The grounds were beautiful from the hotel, to the pools to the beach to the plant nursery and surrounding protected lands with walking paths and cenotes. Everything is maintained with great care and respect for the land. Small touches were ever present from different authentic mexican candies on our pillow each night to our pad of butter in one restaurant wrapped in a green leaf. Little touches that showed how much thought was put into the entire operation. All the hotel staff was friendly, courteous and eager to help in any way they could.

That we would enjoy the \"calm turquoise water of the carribean ocean\" at HTR. But how could we when the water is black, muddy and full of seaweed and other debris? The ocean IS the main attraction for many travelers from the north countries and they should state it clearly on their website that you can't (and won't) swim in the ocean. The mangrove by the side is also in a shockingly bad shape. So is the \"canal\" surrounding the resort. It has a bad odor and when we were there, it was cold. I can't imagine the smell when it's hot. Then, all areas are closed and it's freezing everywhere because of the clim' . Again, it was already cold outside, why freeze the whole damn place? It does not make sense. We tried to eat at the grill outside. They told us \"we are closed\" and refused to serve us even tough many people were still eating. Again, we paid for the \"all included\" package. Seemed to me the all included does include the \"all\" only when it's a convenience for the hotel. The employes were very nice, but no one seemed to know who the responsible person was. They all said \"you have to ask this other person\" for everything and it was like beeing trapped in a Kafka novel. Then the food. Listen. It's ridiculously pretentious and still not good. Tempura over mashed potatoes and black beans? With a plum sauce so sweet it was like sirup. This was supposed to be the fancy \"\u00e0 la carte\" restaurant. We laughed and would have much much preferred a simpler, more authentic mexican cuisine. We tried to forget about it at the bar. Enters \"the sport bar\". Kids everywhere over the pool table and not a barman to be found! We tough it was the kids playground. No. It was the bar. Still, no barman. We frantically searched for a decent drink. Anything would have do. We encountered two bored pizza men, and a terrified (and very angry...) mother \"mapache\" with her babies. We were the only ones there and it was freezing. Again. We went to bed hungry, cold, and alas, very sober. We nicknamed the place \"the mall\" because it felt like beeing trapped in a mall, expensive, luxurious, mais sans \u00e2me. No soul. The beds were excellent. At last something good. We slept and we tried to meet with someone, anybody, who could refund us. \"Ah no, I'm afraid everyone is gone for the week-end, it will have to wait until monday\".

The trip did not start off well even before we left. We tried to arrange private transportation for over a month via emails and telephone calls with no result until the day before we left (our wedding). Overall the resort is beautiful but it's obvious that the resort is still working out kinks being that it's a relatively new resort. Our first impressions were great with a grand entrance and a very friendly welcoming staff. However, when we got to our room we had no type of touch screen or guide to tell us where everything was, no cable TV, and the room was not fully decorated since it was in one of the newer sections of the resort. When we asked the front desk (Hector) about why we didn't have these things it seemed as though we were \"inconveniencing\" him. This seemed to be pretty consistent throughout the week. At one point the staff actually accused us of stealing one of their DVD's because the case had two pages for DVD's and it only came with one...which didn't even work by the way. One thing we were looking forward to was the all-inclusive food and alcohol. The alcohol was great with numerous high end liquors, but my wife and I are not big drinkers so we didn't necessarily get our moneys worth on this. The food, however, was downright bad. We tried nearly every restaurant and the food was either cold, luke warm, or not what we ordered and had to be sent back. The only meals that we even looked forward to eating was the omelette station at breakfast and pizza at lunch/dinner...mostly because they were hot! The best food we had was McDonalds that we had our cab driver take us to on the way to Tulum...and I strongly dislike McDonalds! Activities at the resort were great. Kayaking was awesome, snorkeling was fun, and there was always plenty of other activities going on. The pool staff was sometimes great and sometimes not so great. We tipped 50 pesos everyday and sometimes we got our drinks or food right away and sometimes we got our drinks and food 45 minutes later. Overall, I don't think I'd recommend Hacienda Tres Rios.

Hacienda Tres Rios was a wonderful place to relax and unwind. What we did find was a great resort! What we did not find was anyone sick anywhere. The staff could not have been kinder! The service everywhere was a treat, and the view from our room was peaceful. When we arrived we were greeted with champagne and a great room. We were \"invited\" to a sales presentation which we turned down and were approached 2 other times and politely declined. During our stay the First Lady of Mexico arrived via helicopter so there was security detail everywhere. It was exciting to meet Senora de Calderon and one of the resort owners' daughters we had seen on a YouTube video previously. Even with all the hoopla surrounding her visit we still felt staff attention to detail. While there we did meet several families with fluorescent wristbands and they explained to us that they were there as part of a timeshare and that not everyone there had the same benefits that we had. We were never asked to wear tacky wristbands. Our son enjoyed the kid's club even if there were only two other little girls there. They played together well at the cenotes, made their own pizzas at the outdoor pizza oven, enjoyed making kiddie cocktails, and learning Spanish from the staff. We also enjoyed the Mayan cultural show. The resort used to be a water park but was closed down due to drugs. After being refurbished it is now touted as an ecological resort. The tour into their natural cenotes on site was refreshing and river canoeing was fun also. Communicating with colleagues and the office back home via phone would have been costly and you cannot use a phone card at the resort. Our choices were either to use the internet at the business suite or go into the town of Playa del Carmen and use a payphone with our calling card. Most often we stayed in touch using their free internet. Please do not pay the asking price for a taxi ride into charming Playa del Carmen, bargain a little and have fun with it. We made friends with a great taxi driver and the next day for $40 including a tip we had him as our local tour guide for the entire day. He took us to some beautiful cenotes used by the locals, a super exclusive beach with no hotels around and only a bar, and showed us how the real Mayans live- a world away from the luxuries of Hacienda Tres Rios. The food was good, but the service was better. Everyone giving the hotel a review raves about Oscar the head chef but we never met him, maybe he was too busy with all the Presidential guests. We tried the cricket empanadas upstairs in the Mexican rest. but enjoyed eating under the stars with the Mariachi band, by the pool probably the best. Speaking of the pools, they were always very clean and lovely. As others have stated the view of the ocean was murky, but they told us they are working on this. We thought the pools made up for the lack of beach. Would we return to Hacienda Tres Rios? In a heartbeat. FYI we booked with a travel agency \"Book-it.com\" and later discovered that this agency is owned by the wife of one of the resort owners.

While the review may be legitimate chances are that it is bogus. Remember that when you are looking for a resort. Check-in: Our check in did not go very well. There was one person working at the desk and he did not seem to really know what was going on. We booked two rooms, both junior suites, one with a jacuzzi. We didn\u2019t really want two rooms but I was told that I had to have two rooms because my teenage sons were considered adults. My calls kept getting dropped when I tried to call and confirm so I used the \u201clive person\u201d on their website to confirm. The person running the front desk said that we only had one room. I questioned it and explained what I was told. Then he told me that we could have two rooms but there weren\u2019t any jacuzzi rooms available and there weren\u2019t any adjoining rooms available. I was a little upset that we had confirmed yet our rooms were not available. Additionally, when I confirmed I was told that that our rooms would be adjoining. I showed him the printout of the conversation and he made a copy of it. Still we didn\u2019t get the rooms we had confirmed and we were told that we would be moved to the correct rooms in the morning. The next morning I stopped at the front desk and asked if our rooms were ready. He said that I needed to wait until more people checked-out. He told me that he would call me when the rooms were ready. Later I stopped in the late afternoon and I was again told that they would call me because my rooms were not ready. That evening my husband and I decided that the rooms were fine and that we would unpack and stay. I never informed the front desk that we were going to stay in the rooms. Yet, I never got a call all week to move to the rooms that I was promised. Additionally, we weren\u2019t given the all-inclusive bracelets or the welcome package. While we were waiting for the front desk to find a room for us we were entertained by a church choir. They were really good and they were singing Christmas music. Additionally, there was a waiter making rounds offering us appetizers and drinks. That was a really nice touch. When we got to the room the bus boy basically bolted. I didn\u2019t mind because I figured we could navigate pretty well on our own. We could not find the menu for room service. I called room service and requested a menu. He acted surprised and said that we should have gotten a black book. Shortly after my kids discovered the computer and saw that it had all the information that we needed. It was touch screen and we were able to order room service online. Way cool. Additionally, anything and everything I wanted to know about the resort was there. The rooms: They were very nice and clean. We liked our view of the moat/river and pools with the ocean further away. The marble floors are very pretty and the beds are very comfortable. The linen, towels, stocked fridge, and room service added a lot of value to our room. The shower, double sinks, and closed in toilet were very nice. The blow dryer is worthless though. Bring you own FOR SURE. The food: The food was ok. Disclaimer: we are very fussy and normally are content with plain grilled food so maybe it was too involved for our tastes. Our favorite place to eat was at the Hacienda Grill. Once we figured out how to special order everything plain we liked the food. At the buffet we struggled a little but we were all able to find something that we would eat. The quality was very good. What I really missed, and normally saves us at a buffet, was a full salad bar. Normally, there was lettuce and some green beans, and not much more. We really missed that. After a couple of days we learned to order things that weren\u2019t on the menu. The pizza was ok. Housekeeping: I never did figure out their schedule. I know that they made several rounds to clean, offer fresh towels, toiletries, and refill the mini-bar. They did a really thorough job of cleaning and even folded my kids clothes! Also, much to my dismay, my teenage boys left out expensive electronics more than once and we did not have any problems. The pools: They were a little chilly but better than other places we have been to. In the past we have got to places where no one was in the pool\u2014there were people in the pools\u2014including my family. The chairs were very comfortable. There really wasn\u2019t a problem with finding a chair most of the time. Because we are a family of four I did start saving our chairs so we could sit together. We used the beach beds a few times too and thought it was great. While at the pool and beach there is always someone making rounds bringing food and drinks. I don\u2019t know if it was the language barrier or the waiter\u2019s faulty memory but I am pretty sure that we were given someone else\u2019s food and drinks more than once. Actually, my son\u2019s accidentally got spiked drinks a couple of times. No worries, my husband and I were glad to take them. HA! Beach: The beach itself is great. From the white sand to the beds and chairs it was very clean and well serviced. But what I love most about a beach is the ocean water and that is where the beach stops short. I have been told that they are working on it. Apparently, the mangroves were damaged in the Wilma hurricane causing dirt to wash up to the Hacienda beach. Additionally there is a lot of seaweed (they told me that it wasn\u2019t seaweed\u2014fine there is something weed-like and vine-y that washes up from the ocean). Hacienda\u2019s beach is literally black from the dirt and full of a \u201cweed-like vine-y material\u201d. We only saw people in the water once. On our first day there were two younger kids having a great time. We did go through the cenote which is very clear to the ocean. We were able to walk forever and still not be waist deep. It was very pretty. No one used the hoby cats at all. They were in good shape and I was told that someone would take us if we asked. I didn\u2019t see the canoe\u2019s get used very often either. It is possible that people don\u2019t know that they are available. We wanted to try the hoby cats but we didn\u2019t know who to ask. We talked ourselves out of it because it was very windy anyway. Cenote: it was clear but there was a layer of debris and oil. TV: The TV\u2019s were out the entire time. Normally, we go hard all day and go back to the room and watch a movie and the news in the evening. We really missed the TV\u2019s. The concierge had a lot of movie. Because the whole resort was without cable the movies were normally checked out with just a few left. Under normal conditions the odds are that you will find a movie that you like. Spa: We used the spa for the massages, steam bath, and sauna. We all thought the massages were good and everything was in good working order. They offer a lot of services. The only advice that I can give is to schedule as soon as possible because they fill up. Crowds: I never felt crowded at all. We did not have to stand in line to do anything. There were a few times when we had to wait for the concierge but that is to be expected. I never felt like I had to save our chairs but, as I mentioned, we did save only to make sure we could sit together. We did not have to wait in line to go to the restaurants or make reservations. Staff: Very accommodating and friendly. At times there was a language barrier but it was much better than expected. Summary: There are a few kinks they need to work out. Mostly with communication about what they offer. I did navigate the computer to see what activities they offer (yoga, when the horses were on the beach, etc.) but there wasn\u2019t anyone telling us about activities ever. Additionally, when I would ask the staff they all had different answers. It appears that there is a communication breakdown between the management and staff. I recommend this to someone who is looking for a beautiful resort and is a pool person (not an ocean person).

We booked this trip online earlier in the year for $970 per person (3 persons paying, no extra charge for the toddler) for 7 nights including airfare on American Airlines from Chicago. Our two children, ages 11 and 1 were with us on this trip. We called a couple of times, one week and one month prior to arrival asking that our room be on the ground floor, to be in the same building as our friends, and that the room include a crib. The person on the phone indicated that our requests would be honored. We pre-arranged transportation from the airport to HTR with Exeltur . The ride cost us $85 round-trip vs. most of the airport services wanting upwards of $90 for a one way ride. Our driver was waiting for us when we stepped out of the airport \u2013 the ride was about 40 minutes. We arrived at HTR around 1:00pm and wanted to get into our room so that we could unpack and feed our toddler. Instead, we were given a 20 minute presentation on the resort and how we could get other benefits if we attend a time-share sales presentation. We didn\u2019t indicate any interest, and were never asked again. We were shown our room, but it was on the third floor in a new building that smelled heavily of organic chemicals. The room didn\u2019t have a crib, but looked nice. It was apparent that we were the first ones to stay in that room \u2013 workers were still cleaning construction dust from the hallways. We insisted upon a ground-level room and ultimately ended up next door to our friends. During the switch, I ran into another couple that also did not want to stay in the new building. They also happened to notice that the Jacuzzi in their room didn\u2019t work. The rooms are nice and are well kept. There wasn\u2019t much of a view from our balcony \u2013 but we didn\u2019t mind staying on the first floor because we didn\u2019t want the inconvenience of having to take the elevator every time we stepped out. We requested a crib for our infant, but none arrived. It took some persistence and the crib arrived \u2013 about 3 hours after our initial request. It seemed like the staff was a bit stretched. The pools were nice, we enjoyed them every day. There was a bit of a battle for some of the poolside beds and there was a shortage of towels one day. But those were the only problems. Other reviews mention that poolside drink service was weak. Apparently, this has been corrected. Someone stopped by at least twice an hour asking if we wanted anything. Tipping a dollar or two for each order appeared to keep the staffs\u2019 attention. One day, we ventured to Playa Del Carmen. We shared a taxi ride with our friends. A 12 passenger van cost us about $20 each way. The town was great fun. I recommend visiting in the late afternoon when the street artists are there. During our stay, we visited the plant nursery and cinotes (rivers). The bike tour was fine \u2013 it\u2019s about 30 minutes of biking. The bikes could use some better maintenance. The nearby rivers and wildlife provided our 11 year old and his friends with plenty to do. It was great for them to see all sorts of wildlife. The children also enjoyed canoeing in the river that is in the middle of the resort. The resort had a few Hobie Cat sailboats that were available for use \u2013 but they only allowed them to be used when the water was flat. We used them a couple of times. Internet in the rooms was available, but it seemed to not respond a few times each day. I wouldn\u2019t rely on it if you need to provide support while on vacation. The TV didn\u2019t work 6 of the 7 days in our room \u2013 though we were able to see that the TVs worked in other rooms. We reported this, but it didn\u2019t get fixed. No big deal \u2013 we didn\u2019t go there to watch TV anyway. The water at the beach in front of the resort is filled with brown algae. Not appealing. There are other nicer beaches down the coast at other properties. One day, we hired a van from Exeltur for a day trip to Tulum. 5 hours of service cost $150. The concierge at HTR said that the same service would cost $200 (through another company) if we ordered it through them. The tour of Tulum was good. We purchased admission with a guided tour. Total price with the shuttle ride for 5 was $73. I recommend getting there as early as possible because it is a popular location with tourists. We arrived at 10:00am and it was already getting busy. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of food. HTR food is comparable to Club Med\u2019s, or even better. They have ala carte service at their Grill restaurant. Every entre we tried at the Grill was great. The drink service was good \u2013 though somewhat inconsistent. The bartenders would suggest drinks if you wanted to try something new. We stayed over Christmas week and asked Oscar, the executive chef, whether he could arrange a traditional ethnic Christmas Vigil (meatless) dinner. He agreed and we couldn\u2019t of been more pleased. Oscar went a bit overboard, and prepared a 12 course meal. I wouldn\u2019t of believed it if I didn\u2019t see it. I just wish that we asked for 4 courses instead of the traditional 12. We made sure to tip the wait staff and the mariachi band that entertained us. The resort arranged for live entertainment during a beach party, similar to an evening luau. There was also live entertainment on Christmas Eve in the center of the resort. The staff also seemed to enjoy the opportunity to dance and celebrate with the clientele. None of us were sick during the trip \u2013 even though we had drinks with ice and drank the water poured at the tables. My sense is that their filtration system works well. Staff restocked the refrigerator in the room each day with soda, beer and water. Yes, drinking straws are somewhat rare at the resort \u2013 they claim to be eco friendly and can provide a paper drinking straw. That doesn\u2019t explain the heavy disposable plastic stirrers that are placed into each drink. It seems like a plastic straw would use less plastic and could also serve as a stirrer.

We were \"present\" on the bed, unlike many others that had items on the beds(reserving them) and then never bothered to show up until noon, which is not fair to other people who could be using the bed from 7 am on..... We had dinner at the \"Chef's Table\" and it was wonderful ! Oscar is a great chef and we were very impressed with our dinner. Arturo (Wine person) was also very accomodating. As another poster said, \"communication was lacking between the staff\" though. No one seemed to know exactly what activities were being held and where. We missed 20 minutes of a cooking demonstration because no one knew where it was. Asking different employees, you'd get different answers from each one. Activities, special dinners, etc. should be posted daily in the lobby then there would be no question what is going on and where they are being held. Maybe more people would be in attendance at these demonstrations. The mole demonstration (which was wonderful) was attended by me and my husband. All the prep work for this demonstration only to have two people attend ? The ocean was not as pretty as we hoped it would be. Not blue...more gray. Weather and all the rivers flowing around contributed to it. The beach was nice but nothing spectacular. It was relaxing to spend all day by the ocean though and be in warm weather ! We had many staff waiting on us and taking care of us, even calling us by our names...making sure we were being pampered. To mention a few...Angel (at breakfast and the beach), Elva (restaurant), the bartender in the Mexican restaurant (can't remember name), the bartender and attendants at the outdoor grill and also the wood-fired pizza oven. The rooms are spacious and beautiful, with a wonderful view of the ocean. The bathroom set up was really nice with the walk-in shower on one side and the spacious sink area. We went to the sauna and steam room. They were not upscale and one sauna room was out of order. We were a little disappointed with the quality and appearance but it served the purpose. It looked like it was added \"after the fact\" of building the resort. It's not up to standard with the rest of the resort amenities. Maybe in their future expansion they will build a more luxurious spa. Overall, it was a very nice vacation.

I will hopefully make one person's vacation much better than if they were to waste their time with a salesperson at the airport and spending half your day traveling to this 'Hacienda\" resort, going on a 3+ hour tour, which was supposed to be 90 MINUTES and then if it isn't financially possible to afford the payments to try and explain that to at least three different high pressured sales individuals who absolutely will not take \"NO\" for an answer. Still, after a few weeks my wife is upset with what I made her go through by signing up for this AND actually giving cash up front at the airport. Just to maybe save a buck for an event I wanted to do. This place is situated back a mile and a half from the main road winding through a jungle lined with security folks and what appeared to be machine guns which made us skeptacle from the beginning. After we toured the \"very nice hotel\" we told two sales reps, one a \"manager\" it was a very nice place but we couldn't afford it. They kept coming back with other less expensive options which we found them still too expensive for our budget. We were then bought back to a man who made us go into a closed room and \"drilled\" us on why we couldn't afford any of these. He also gave us a few other options which just didn't seem appealing. We thought for sure we were going to die there and I was thinking of telling them I would buy something just to be let out alive. Finally, after another 15 minutes of him questioning us soo rudely and making my wife tear up they refused to shake my hand and sent us to pick up our promised event tickets. At that point neither of us cared about any \"gift\" and just wanted to get out to the main road where we could at least take a cab back to our hotel. We wasted a whole morning and most of an afternoon and were both ready to cry. As it turns out they did give us a few \"event\" tickets we were promised, however, transportation to the event tour one+ hour away was also promised by the airport salesperson but wasn't included and a \"fee\" was added to each ticket which was never explained. Basically if we were to have gone on the \"event\" we were promised it would have cost us more for the transportation to get there and the\"fees\" that it would have been better to get tickets for an event tour at our hotel and get transportation.They eventually did get a driver to drive us back to our hotel and he was very nice and actually offered us some good information. I do thank him for being soo nice to us. Very unfortunate this all took place the day after we arrived in Cancun as it really took the wind out of our sails for most of the week as we were both shaken from the experience. I guess even at my \"old\" ripe age I am still learning things but I will NEVER get myself into that kind of mess again. Basically, I did get a free very good breakfast...which I could've gotton at my hotel because it was 'all inclusive\" anyway, and I did tour the Tres Rios Hacienda resort which could be potentially appealing and affordable to some people. However, if you think there may be a possibility you can't accept their offers, please, please stay away and save your vacation. -glad to be alive", "Date": "January 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Millet, AB,", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place to stay!\u201d", "Author": "bw_klein", "ReviewID": "UR52220375", "Content": "This was our 4th resort we stayed at along the Mayan Riveria, 2 south of Playa Del Carmen and 2 north of Playa Del Carmen.

Beach was great. Only thing wrong was the ocean was not the nicest, dirty water from teh Mangrove trees, still swam in it, kids played in it every day just not nice blue like othe resorts. One other thing is communication there was lacking, was not aware of some activities that where gong on even when we asked the concierge he could not tell us.

They are an investment of time and money to improve you (and your family\u2019s) physical and mental well being. So the last thing you want is problems and distractions that create stress, which is what you are going on vacation to get away from in the first place. One of the best places my family and I have found to relax without any worries was at Hacienda Tres Rios in Mexico\u2019s Riviera Maya, south of Cancun and north of Playa del Carmen. This is a magnificent all-inclusive resort. The staff understands why its guests are there and that is to relax and be pampered. And we were! My family of two adult and two children visited the week of Christmas 2009. The staff said the hotel was entirely booked, but it never seemed crowded and the staff never seemed so busy as to decrease their attention to you. Yes, the resort is beautiful. Two large pools occupy the center: one more quiet, one more activity oriented. The famous king-sized canopy beds line the spotless beach allow for total relaxation. The crystal clear rivers, flowing from the cenotes to the ocean, provide a wonderful and calm place to swim or search for aquatic wildlife. The marble-lined suites are spacious and roomy. But I think what makes this resort stand head and shoulders above the others we\u2019ve visited is the staff. They honestly go out of their way to make sure you are pleased. We found them so friendly that we learned their names very quickly. From Miguel, the catamaran captain, to Tony and Andy, the sports and activities directors, to Justino, Angel, Trinidad and Elva, the waiters, to Abernathy, the beach barman, to Nancy, the buffet restaurant hostess, to Hector, the concierge. Their politeness and eagerness made us feel totally at ease and free from stress during our stay. All of this customer-pleasing behavior is epitomized by the famous Oscar, the resort\u2019s executive chef. As it was our first Christmas Eve \u2013 a major family holiday for us \u2013 we asked Oscar if it was possible to whip up some non-meat dishes to reflect our traditional Polish Christmas Eve dinner. Our family and our friends were blown away by the culinary glory we were served! Including a personalized birthday cake for our friends. Another family from Toronto, at the same dinner, were served a totally vegan dinner that they were singing the praises of. In fact, every meal we had was delicious. The outdoor grill became our favorite lunch spot, while the young boys in our group loved heading to the outdoor brick pizza oven or ordering plates of nachos. There\u2019s a kids club but our boys preferred to be on their own and enjoyed the pool, playing water polo, or volley ball or soccer with the other guests under the direction of Tony and Andy. The evening entertainment is also well done, from the welcoming Mexican Fiesta, with mariachis, to the Mayan and Fire shows, to the Caribbean Party on the beach. There was also a Christmas Eve party in the main \u201csquare\u201d of the resort, with live music and dancing. The resort tours to the cenotes are also worth booking, and because space is limited and there are many guests, they do fill up. However, we were still able to change our tours on Tuesday for Wednesday and Thursday without problem. However, our lackadaisicalness in booking a massage meant we couldn\u2019t get one. Not a big deal. We visited Playa del Carmen\u2019s famous 5th Avenue on a cloudy day by booking a taxi for $26 roundtrip and booked a taxi that took us to the ruins in Tulum, though there is an outside tour desk that will arrange tours for you. When it came time to leave, check out was at 11 am and our taxi was arriving at 2:30 pm. So we sat on the beach while our luggage was securely stored and when it was time to leave, we were given a courtesy room to change into our travel clothes. It\u2019s those little things that you appreciate because it\u2019s one less thing to worry about. And we certainly didn\u2019t worry about anything while we stayed at Hacienda Tres Rios. We\u2019ll be back. The only negative came from an intolerant guest, who felt the need to payback his hosts\u2019 hospitality by stealing the baby Jesus statue from the outdoor Nativity display.", "Date": "December 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "CO", "Title": "\u201cOur Home Away From Home\u201d", "Author": "theasheart", "ReviewID": "UR51896222", "Content": "We went the day after the news declared Mexico the epicenter for the Swine Flu.

The staff, without exception, were wonderful. All were friendly and helpful. The rooms were extreme luxury, with marble, fine linens and towels, stocked fridge, turndown service, 24 hour room service, etc. We are nature lovers and came to explore the \"tres rios\" and cenotes. There are many included nature tours (with usually only 2-6 people). The paths are well-maintained to allow exploring on your own as well. We kayaked early every morning and enjoyed the many birds. We came prepared with bug spray, but there were NO mosquitos. The pools are huge and beautiful. The beds on the beach are relaxing. Enjoy unlimited plush towels without signing for them or giving your room key or any such nonsense. Enjoy happy cocktail and food service delivered to your lounge chair. As noted in other reviews, the ocean is NOT inviting. It appears that organic matter, that looks like peat moss, washes from of the mangrove swamps, out through of the rivers and into the ocean. The waves then pulverize this material and this leads to muddy-appearing beach water. If you want to play in the ocean, this is not the place for you. On the other hand, they rivers themselves are clear and snorkeling is possible in the small rivers and some of the cenotes. The food is OK. Neither the buffets nor the a la cartes were great, but overall, the food was OK. The staff is happy to try to be accommodating. The 7-course meal at the chef's table was the exceptionally good meal. We had this on our last night and would recommend it. The bars were well-stocked and the service was very good. Food safety: we had not even a hint of intestinal distress. We did not drink tap water (there is bottled water in the rooms), but we had water in the restaurants and even had sushi. A word about time-share sales. Our welcoming concierge gave us the welcoming overview of the resort and then mentioned the gifts we would receive for taking a sales tour. We told her we were not interested, and we were not approached again regarding sales. We continued to have happy, friendly service. The resort could not have been 25% full on our visit. Positives: no waits for seating in any restaurants; easy to relax. Negatives: full buffets were set up for a handful of people, so the food turnover may not have been frequent - we went for mostly cook-to-order food; not a rocking place for the younger set. So, in summary, come here for relaxation, pampering, and nature. Thoughts about the future: The resort as it stands now is on the south side of the southern of 3 rivers. The middle and south rivers both begin in cenotes and flow to the ocean. They can be kayaked and snorkled. The northern river is actually more of a mangrove estruary with lots of shallow branching waterways. The master plan for the site includes another resort between the two southern rivers. It also appears that the northern mangrove estruary is to be replaced by a marina and several single family homes with docks. The consequences for birds and fish may be significant. It remains to be seen if this development stays true to the eco-friendly theme that is in place now.

As a travel agent, I won the four nights at a tradeshow. We stayed in a room with jacuzzi on the balcony with views of the pool, river and ocean. Resort was beautiful, about 30 minutes from Cancun airport. The resort was not crowded except for a large wedding party for a couple of days, but overall it was very quiet. The service was top notch. Pool and beach service was a plus. Drink orders and food orders brought right to you. Oscar, the executive chef was always around, making himself available to answer questions and just a very personable gentleman. Everyone in the resort was friendly and always made you feel welcome and there was not anything they could not do for you. Drinks were plentiful. Food was very good. I thought the Italian was superb. Also ate outside under the stars and the meal was delicious as well as the sax player which added a very nice ambiance. Don't be afraid to ask for something you may not see on the menu, as they always try to accommodate you. One day they came around the pool with crackers with fresh tuna on them as an appetizer. The next day I saw Oscar and asked if there was any more of it and he asked how I wanted it (on what kind of bread) and had it delivered to me at the pool. Also, one day asked the server at the pool if they had any shrimp and within minutes they brought plates full of grilled shrimp which were delicious! Pools were very nice and relaxing. We stayed at the adults pool most of our stay. Was very relaxing and they play beautiful music so you can still read and relax. The beach is very nice with beds along the beach that are very comfortable. I found the water to be a bit murky and had a lot of seaweed in parts of it. Facing the water from the beach, further down to the left the water was clearer and less seaweed. I found the bottom in the water a bit \"mushy\". I did swim in the river closest to the sea and the water was crystal clear and very refreshing. I did not indulge in the \"cenotes\". Pretty much just vegged out at the pool or on the beach beds. Very quiet at night. Would not recommend this resort if you are looking to party the night away. I would recommend this resort very highly.

We arrived at the airport, what a zoo. Make sure that you have transportation arranged before you arrive, that way you won't be scammed into some sort of timeshare presentation. We met our family at the meeting place and found our van service and off we went. I was surprised to see so much destruction and garbage along the way. I assumed that 5 years after Wilma things should have been completed and cleaned up. In Canada we have a recyle program for bottles and cans, no word of a lie there were literally thousands of them along the road. We arrived at Tres Rios, the drive in from the main road felt peaceful and serene. It wound around all the mangroves, trees and fawna. It felt like it had always been there and not a new resort. Upon our arrival the bell boys greeted us took our luggage and directed us to check in. There were greeted with a lovely green juice, which is celery, pinapple and parsley. Fantastic! Very cooling, also they had cool faceclothes with a hint of lemon for us. Check in was smooth, and the girl at the front desk was very friendly. We were then directed to the lobby to wait for one of the girls, she came over and explained what was were, and what tours were available and also to offer you a timeshare presentation. Shikra then took us to our room and showed the room to us, it was on the second floor. 2 bedroom that sleeps 8. OMG! Bathrooms are floor to ceiling Marble, all floors are marble. Ok so where do I start, the main sitting area has a couch and chair, flat screen TV, touch screen panel to order things like room service, turn down service ect... We used that several times trying to order room service and it didn't seem to be working, we asked several times and then finally when the waiter came he advised that that service was not working. Mini Bar also in this room stocked daily with water, pop and beer. There was also a full bathroom in this area. Also you can go out to the balcony from here with sliding doors. This balcony goes acroos this unit and connects with the masterbed room. Only has 2 chairs. If you open the doors the AC goes off. That is a really nice feature so that you are not wasting power. Masterbed room... King size bed, and boys it was comfortable, falt screen TV, Whirlpool tub and another couch. Patio doors out to the balcony. Only down part of this is only 2 chairs on the deck, the unit is for 8. If we all wanted to sit out we had to drag out chairs from in side. Our bathroom was huge! The dressing area had a great size closest, bank of drawers and 2 sinks and a sit down area for applying makeup ect.. The toilet was in a room off of this all by its self and the shower was off of this as well and was huge, it also had a clothesline for hanging things to dry. NIce. The second bedroom was a fantastic size as well. 2 full size beds, flat screen, mini bar, couch, bathroom and patio doors out to their own private balcony. Again on this one there are 2 chairs and small table. All of the units face the water. They all have a lovely view of the river around the property, the pool area and the ocean. It is a must to get up early at least one morning and watch the sunrise and listen to the sounds of the birds. Amazing! There are several restaurants, a la carte and buffet. There are two buffet restaurants for breakfast, make sure you get to the Mexican buffet for breakfast it is really quite lovely. The Grill for lunch is the best. Samuel is wonderful, you will see him around all the time, from early morning to late evening. If they don't have it ask and they will get it. There was an Italian, Thai, Steak and Mexican a la carte restaurants, there was a Mexican welcome party and a caribbean beach party. Portions were small as with any fine dining experience. I really feel that the food was just a little pretentious. Also we enjoy alot of flavour. Garlic, spices, hot etc... Some of the foods seemed a little bland. We spoke with Oscar and my friend mentioned this to him, and he explained that Mexican food isn't all hot and spicey, he mentioned to ask for his food spicey and they would do that for him. Other friends of ours where staying there and didn't see Lasagna on the menu and ask Ocsar for it and he had the chefs make it form them. Very accomodating. Hector at the concierge was FANTASTIC! He knew everything about anything we wanted to do, I wish I could have packed him in my suit case and brought him home. There is also a coffee bar. I would highly recommend it. If Antonio is there have him make the specialty coffe for you. What an experience. The waiting staff is truly amazing. They tend to every need. They are always there ready at an moment for any request. Alfredo in the Italian Reastaurant was fab.... Fansisco in the Martini Bar was awsome, ask him for the chocolate mint martini...Yum! Head of the activities I believe is Roberto, and Serigo! I love these two so much they made our stay fantastic. There are the best! AAA+ The only negative thing that we found other then not having Orange Pekoe Tea, which if there are a lot of Canadians travelling there this would be a necessity, was consistency. If we found something that we liked to eat and ordered it again, it was never the same thing. Room service never brought everything that we ordered. We ordered everyday and there was always something missing or the wrong thing sent. For instance were ordered 2 apple juice and 2 orange juice they sent sliced apples and oranges, just small things. I'm sure with more time things will smooth out. Somethime it was clearly a language barrier. Our mini bar was fully stocked but by the end of the week they were only leaving 2 bottles of water and that was it. Beach....Pools Pools are fabulous, the pool near the grill was the adult section. Lots of sunbeds and umbrellas. Service at the pool was great and fast. Fernando and Carlos were the best. As far as tipping, we always tip, however at the end so really it doesn't affect your service whether you tip or not. Down at the beach they have lovely four poster canopy beds. We went in the water once while we were there they are still trying to clean the water area. I must say if you want to swim in the ocean go a little to the right and swim there. We swam at the beach area and we ended up getting stung, by what we are not sure because the water is murky looking in that area. If you get a chance to do the Cenotes, I would highly recommend it. We seen a turtle. We didn't get to them all due to the amount of rain that came during the week. We will definitely go back to this resort, the service and staff out way the little things that weren't consistant..", "Date": "November 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ivyland, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Resort and Outstanding Service\u201d", "Author": "traveler2828", "ReviewID": "UR49082374", "Content": "We stayed at Hacienda Tres Rios from October 31st to November 7th 2009. In our group was myself, my wife and my son who is 13 years old. We were in a two bedroom suite. This suite is one two bedroom suite away from the end of the southern building, closest to the ocean and on the top floor. This suite also had a spiral staircase going up from the balcony to a wooden terrace on the roof. Nothing was on this terrace, but we were told that some terraces have a jacuzzi. It was a good view all the same and also quite private. The rooms were quite luxurious as pictured on their website and in pictures posted by tripadvisor members including pictures by myself. This is by far the nicest resort I've ever been in. It's design is slightly more Mexican than many other resorts and was meant to be that way. I guess the more modern resort they plan to build on the Tres Rios site to the north will be less Mexican inspired design and more westernized and modern than Hacienda Tres Rios. They are still doing construction on the final building on the north side of the resort. I was told that this should be done by sometime in December. They were also doing some minor construction at the pool area closest to the resort. Not sure what they were doing there. We were also told that once this construction finishes they will connect the circular water feature inside the resort ground with the external water in the jungle and swamp. This will clear up the water and after that they plan to start up the gondola rides on the circular water feature. None of this construction impacted our enjoyment of the resort, in fact, unless you went looking, you rarely noticed it. They are also working on and finishing up the first La Herencia which is a building with one, two and three bedroom units with jacuzzis on the roof, kitchens in the units, basically fully functional luxury condos. There is planned to be more, but I do not know the number. These include butler service and personal chef service. They even provide storage so you can decorate the condo suite as you like it while you're there and when you leave, they will store it for you and put everything back as you had it when you come back. It's quite expensive to buy in for one month minimum, but if you want this level of service, I guess it's worth it. At this time there were two primary indoor food locations one on the lowest floor and one on the next floor up typically accessed from an elevator just to the right of the concierges. Just push the R button in the elevator to get to the restaurant. The bottom floor is called the PB floor and the next floor up is called the 1st floor and so on to the 3rd floor which is the highest floor in the resort. Starting at 7:00 am, the restaurant on the PB floor becomes Casas Las Islas with buffet breakfast and lunch. Lunch starts at approximately noon. At 7:00 pm this restaurant is transformed either into Porto Bella (Italian) or Katori (Asian Fusion). Which restaurant varies and it's not a simple change from one day to the other. Check the console in the room to see what the restaurant schedule is when you arrive. At this restaurant if you want something other than the house wines, you can select from a wine rack for an extra charge beyond the all inclusive charge. The restaurant upstairs on the 1st floor accessed via the elevator is a Mexican buffet in the morning nominally opening at 7:00 am but really getting things ready for 8:30 am when the sales team brings potential buyers for breakfast to that restaurant. The second sales tours start at 9:30 am. We never ate lunch indoors although it was available but we either ate at the outdoor restaurants or ordered room service. The outdoor restaurants are the Hacienda Grill which serves sandwiches and entrees and the Pizzeria Il Forno. I liked the chicken stuffed with ham and cheese at the Hacienda Grill and the pizza was good at the Pizzeria Il Forno but the calzone I had was too doughy although quite acceptable. They only have sweetened iced tea not unsweetened ice tea at the indoor restaurants. I liked almost everything I had although I am sure there would have been things on the menu I wouldn't have liked, but that is true at almost any restaurant. Whether you like something is a personal thing. I also liked the pig or pork dish in the Mexican Restaurant, Alebrije, served in the evening. This is also where you can get the cricket appetizer which is also good. My son cut it open so he could see the cricket and so after that he refused to eat it. My wife liked the Salmon dish on the room service menu and I liked the chocolate cake alot and the Tiramisu less so also on the room service menu. The Patisserie Cafe de Paris is indoors and opens at teatime nominally 3:00 pm although it wasn't always open when I thought it would be open. They have small sweets and also small single or two bite sandwiches. They have gourmet coffee there and also claim to have tea but if you order tea there, they fetch it from the main restaurant, Casas Las Islas. The Sports Bar is also indoors but only serves drinks, no food. They do have activities at the Sports Bar. This is where you play Jenga or use the pool-table or the XBox. They also have flat screen TVs in there if my memory serves me correctly. According to representatives of the resort, there will eventually be 9 total food and drink locations. One will be a deli or a sandwich shop quite likely and both Porto Bella and Katori will have separate locations and will be available every day. This may happen as early as sometime in December. This should improve the already great restaurant selections. Since this is also construction related, we also got an update on their plans for a onsite scuba shop and tour operator. They are in negotiations with a sponsor to build the scuba shop and perhaps even staff it. The scuba boat will be based at the pier. It is probably six months to a year out, but that is my speculation. I also found out that they are planning on building a zip line in the jungle but that is also six to eight months out and is still in the active planning stage. Also to show their eco focus, they've decided not to build a golf course which was in their original plans as it would cause too large an impact on the local environment even though they could have claimed it was a green feature. One really nice touch that some other all-inclusives don't do, is if you check out but you are still at the resort because your plane flight is late in the afternoon, you can still eat at the restaurants. The opening times of the restaurants is what I call on resort time, so even if they are supposed to be open, they may be only setting up and will not be opening for a while. We got caught in this. We ordered pizza as Casas Las Islas was delayed beyond their nominal opening time. The schedule for the activities is on their website www dot haciendatresrios dot com. I will repeat it here though for completeness and describe in more detail those we went on. They have yoga classes, meditation classes, stretching classes and pilates classes at 8:00 am and 9:00 am. The 8:00 am are in spanish and the 9:00 am are in english. At 9:30 am is the Bicycle tour and at 10:00 am is the Jaguar tour. At 11:00 am is Beach Volleyball near the beach area and at 12:30 pm are various activities. They are Flavors of Yucatan on Monday, Cocktail class Tuesday, Towels decoration Wednesday, Cocina Natura on Thursday, Fruit Carving on Friday and Sushi Class on Sunday. At 2:00 pm the tours alternate from the Tigrillo tour to the Coati tour. AT 3:00 pm they have Bocci Ball on Monday, Horse Shoes on Tuesday, Plant your Mangrove on Wednesday, Bocci again on Thursday, beach game or Friday and Horse Shoes again on Sunday. At 3:30 pm they have various activities once again. They are Wine Tasting on Monday, Tequila Tasting on Tuesday, Mole History on Wednesday, Water Polo on Thursday, Soccer on Friday and Soccer on Sunday. At 4:00 pm, on Monday they have a Massage demonstration, on Tuesday it's a Nursery tour, Wednesday Spanish class, Thursday Nursery tour, Friday Spanish class and Sunday Spanish class. On Saturday from approximately 12:30 pm on they have welcome briefings and continue on Sunday morning from 8:00 am until about noon. They tours schedule described above differ just a bit from the schedule they have posted online. We did the Tigrillo tour which involved going to Cenote Aguila where you can snorkel if you so choose for about 10 minutes. I snorkeled the Cenote Aguila. There are fish there including a small school of dark fish about 1 1/2 to 2 feet in length and some yellow striped fish just over a foot in length. Other fish were in there but they were smaller and not overly distinctive. I also saw a crab. The roots from the trees were cool too and you could see the underground tunnels where the water connects from cenote to cenote. After snorkeling, we got in the kayaks and paddled down near the beach area where we pulled out of the water onto a sandy beach area near the north side of the resort near the beach. If you do decide to snorkel make sure you reapply the mosquito repellant over your body as I didn't and received many mosquito bites while I kayaked from the cenote to the beach. The mosquitos are much worse during the rainy season which we were on the tail end of at the beginning of November. The difference from this tour and the Jaguar tour is that in the Jaguar tour you do the snorkeling at Cenote Aguila, kayak to the beach and then kayak up to the Cenote Tortuga. With the Coati tour you tour the Nursery and then swim and snorkel at Cenote Aguila. The Senseadventure tour isn't on the schedule but I believe it is at 11:00 am, 12:00 noon, 1:20 pm and 2:00 pm every day other than perhaps Saturday and/or Sunday. We went on this and it was very nice. You go blindfolded through much of this and I won't go into too much more detail other than saying it teaches you to trust directions, enhances all your other senses including touch, smell, taste, sound and puts you in a expansive state if possible for you. You also take the blindfold off for a short bit of a time. It's probably best if you go with someone close to you like a wife or husband but it's not absolutely necessary. It enhances peace and serenity as well. The Kids club includes a number of activities but my son mostly just utilized the XBox in the kids club during rainy periods. It rained a fair amount during our time at the resort but we had sun most days if only for a few hours. Monday was actually our best day with sun all day except for a brief shower at around about noon for about 20 minutes. The kids club splits the kids into age groups, 4-12 and 13 and up. I'm not sure about the minimum age but this is my recollection. All the employees were quite courteous, with \"Hola\", \"Buenos Dias\", \"Buenos Tardes\" and \"Buenos Noche\"s and even \"Como Esta\" if you showed any propensity to respond properly. They also sometimes utilized \"de nada\" as appropriate to \"Muchos Gracias\" or Thank you. Everyone seemed to want to help as much as they were able to. Part of the issue is finding the right person to ask to get the answer that you need. Most of the Concierges and desk people spoke good english and understood who knew what and where they were. Also Oscar, the head chef seemed to be in charge of the whole resort and sometimes stepped in to make sure the food order was right. He also responded to my in-laws request to turn down the volume of the music by the pool as my in-laws thought the music was too loud. We ordered room service quite a bit and one issue we discovered is the food sometimes comes luke warm. One interesting thing that I discovered is that you can request a microwave oven for your room at no charge and we did. It came in handy to warm up room service food that was not warm enough. There is also a small booth down near the pool closest to the beach where a vendor sells mostly hand made items. He can make somethings right there if you need it personalized. An example is my son wanted a bracelet but the bracelets on display didn't have his name so the vendor made it for him and it took about 20 minutes and he kept going even in the rain as it started raining shortly after we asked him to make it for our son. They also set-up a drink station at the pool near the beach. I think this was a response to the initial criticism of the time it took to get drinks while at the beach or the pools. The servers are now all over the area and usually come by more than often enough for me. Also, unusually for many resorts, they have one lifeguard who wanders around the beach and pool areas. This is more than most resorts in my humble opinion. In spite of this, at one point while I was in a pool a young girl with poor swimming skills jumped in the water to go after a ball that was floating in the pool. She was struggling to stay afloat and appeared to be flailing around in the water. I didn't see any parents anywhere nearby, so I lifted her and carried her to the edge of the pool and helped her get out. The pools are mostly 5 feet deep in most areas although they do have areas where you can sit in the water and not be fully in the water if you want that. The nightly entertainment was excellent. The Mayan Show was athletic and they did dances and acted out stylized hunts and played a simplified version of the Mayan ball game that turned into an athletic dance. The Fire Show was also quite nice and involves a number of in-shape and athletic men and women working flaming batons, sticks and other items. The Live Music night was nice with a band they brought in from the Dominican Republic if my memory serves me correctly. They played 40s music and latin music. I didn't stay too long as my wife went up with my son and I went up shortly afterwards but I heard a Salsa number before I left and people were dancing by then. I didn't participate in the Karaoke night or Casino night so I cannot say anything about them. We did check out the gym and they had elliptical machines which I like and some stationary bicycles and treadmill machines. They also had free weights and weight machines as well and a large Pilates yoga ball. The car rental is on the right in the corridor past the patisserie and Sports bar on the right. There is also an ATM there. The Spa and gym are past the Patisserie, the car rental booth and after going through glass doors you then go up one floor via an elevator or stairs that are on the right. They do have fairly easy to use Hoby Cat sailboats with minimal adjustments to make it easy for anyone not used to sailing catamarans to sail them. They had two working while we were there. They were working on some others so they should have more shortly. They also, obviously have kayaks. We were also told that in December, they plan to have some yachts tied up to the pier right at Hacienda Tres Rios, so guests will not have to travel to the Sunset Lagoon Resort in Cancun to rent yachts if renting a yacht is desired. The accomodations were very nice. We had a two bedroom suite. The master bedroom had a king size bed with a jacuzzi next to the window. The beds have pillow top mattresses and very nice pillows too. I would have liked a larger jacuzzi but that's me, perhaps not everyone would agree. They do provide a package of bath salts for the jacuzzi. The showers are quite nice and luxurious, the separate toilet area is nicely spare with a telephone on the wall and the bathroom area is quite big with storage in the form of a closet and drawers in that area as well. They provide soap, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, hair cap and a complementary sewing repair kit. In my wife's opinion, the built in hair dryer is underpowered and takes too long to dry hair as it's too weak a flow and perhaps not hot enough. They had a large flat screen TV with DVD player also in the master bedroom. There was also a sofa with pull out bed and coffee table. Two bedside tables were also there and a clock radio with an IPOD connection or standard stereo audio connection to an MP3 player. Two chairs and a small table were out on the balcony. A spiral staircase from the balcony in the Master Bedtroom went up to a roof-top wooden terrace with a great view and excellent privacy. In the living/dining room area, there is a large table for six and a sofa with pull out bed that our son used to sleep on. There was also a large flat screen TV in the living room but no DVD player and a dresser with shelves and drawers. A small coffee table was in that room and a chair separate from the dinner table furniture. There was no outdoor furniture on the balcony for that room but the balcony connects to the balcony for the master bedroom so that's not any problem at all. The bathroom in the living/dining section was smaller than the master bathroom but also had a nice shower although the toilet and sink were in the same room. The second bedroom was separated by doors that can be opened from both sides to connect the suites. We left them closed as our in-laws stayed there. Two coffee machines were in the suite. One in the second bedroom and one in the living/dining room. There were two queen sized beds in second bedroom, a sofa with pull out bed and a small table for two to eat at in that room as well. Sometimes a jacuzzi is out on the balcony in this room but there wasn't one in the room my in-laws stayed in although they had outdoor furniture there. The second bedroom also had it's own luxurious bathroom with a very nice shower just like all the other rooms and a underpowered hair dryer. The two pools were also very nice. One nice feature that isn't obvious is if you like swimming, the pool nearest the ocean has a very long linear area that you can swim a long way without turning around. You do have to curve just a bit, but that wasn't a problem for me or probably for just about anyone. I took a number of pictures of the resort and have posted them here on tripadvisor with this review and also some videos. We were very happy with everything and all the employees. Other than the weather we were very happy and the resort couldn't do anything about the weather. We can't complain as the last time we were in the Playa del Carmen area in early November 2008 the weather was gorgeous with just one short passing shower that I remember. There was a wedding party here this time and they had to move their ceremony in from the outside to the inside but they were still quite happy with the resort and accomodations and how they handled the wedding arrangements. On a side note, during our stay, the Maxim Girls showed up for a photo and video shoot and to do some sponsored activities like play volleyball, kick a soccer ball, play flag football and run an obstacle course. They enjoyed mixing with the other guests and seemed happy to have their picture taken with guests including our son. We heard that the photos will be in the Mexican edition of Maxim only. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions on this resort. If I know the answer, I will be happy to help you out.

Layout is good with nothing too far away. Flat screens in rooms and were just installing an interactive system in the rooms which will allow you to access concierge, make a wake up call, look at menus, order room service, etc. Found upon entering room there seemed to be a musty smell but believe it actually was a bio-degradable bug spray that was in room. Our room had a jacuzzi on the balcony. Wi-fi is accessible throughout the resort and also in the room, which is unusual. No connection problems. Resort is a green resort and gets its name from the 3 rivers that abut the resort and empty into the ocean. Ride in to the resort was interesting as you were surrounded by the mangroves and a lot of flora. Don't know if we went in by the wrong entrance as our driver had never been there before. Were greeted with cold towels and a pineapple/celery juice combination which they called green juice and was much better than it sounds. Resort is mostly complete but they were working on one wing while we were there. Noise was very minimal. Restaurants- Cafe Islas is the buffet area and only choice, besides room service, for breakfast. Also have afternoon and evening buffet there. Indoor. Good buffet with omelet/egg station and some interesting menu items. For a buffet was better than average. Traditional Mexican, Alibrije,is indoors and very colorful with very nice artwork. Buffet for lunch and ala carte for dinner. Very good food with some interesting dishes. My thoughts on all the specialty dining (although we did not try the Asian) was that the food was exceptional, approaching gourmet. European portions throughout. The real problem was the menu translation to English was very poor. They really need to hire someone to do this as sometimes the dish would come out and you were wondering what you thought you ordered. This notwithstanding, liked every item that I ordered and it actually became kind of funny. Did really like the Chipotle Creme Brule that we had here for dessert. Seemingly an odd combination but excellent. No reservations are required for the ala carte restaurants. Right now the Asian Fusion, Kotori, and the Italian ,Porto Bello, swap nights at the same area but we were told that the permanent home of Porto Bello is near completion. There is an outdoor pizza venue, Pizzeria Il Forno, that uses a wood burning brick oven, that is open in the afternoon. Pizzas were surprisingly good- had a wonderful 4 cheese pie. Also the Hacienda Grill, which is an outdoor venue near the pool area, and is open for lunch and dinner. Only had lunch here and again, excellent. Patisserie offered desserts and finger foods at tea time in the afternoon. They also served wonderful espresso and cappuccinos. Coffee at the resort was rather poor and found that not all the espressos and cappuccinos were made with the same method so they were a bit hit or miss. Bars- Room occupancy was low while we were here so the bars were fairly quiet. The Victory Sports bar with pool table and multiple flat screen TV's seemed the most popular. There is a tequila bar at the Mexican restaurant, but I did not visit it as tequila is not my favorite. There also is a Outdoor Martini bar area in the evenings just outside the Cafe Islas buffet restaurant. There was never ANY problem getting a drink at any time, anywhere. Pool areas- Were very nice although not overly large and they were working on a portion of the upper pool area that I think is or will be the adult pool area. Plenty of chaises available and no \"towel cards\" needed. Really liked the 2 person circular beds with an adjustable covering that they had. Very comfy and nice if you did not want to be in the full sun. Pools had a couple of areas built in them some you could sit or lie in half a foot of water or even a couple of inches. Staff was ever present around the pool to refresh drinks. Spa- My wife and I had a couples massage at the Ya'ax Che Spa. Very nice spa area that also had the Beauty Salon. Room used was very nice and the masseuses were very good. After the massage there was a terrace with a filled jacuzzi and glasses of wine and fruit tray. Cost was $180USD total for two. Tours- The resort offers a number of tours run by the resort staff. We did the Senses tour and El Tigrillo. The Senses tour is very good and completely unique and I would highly recommend it. Because it is so different, with a mystical quality, I don't want to give any details- just do it! We also took the El Tigrillo tour which went to the nurseries where the resort grows flora to replenish the area, cenote snorkeling in some cool waters, and then kayaking back to the resort through the mangrove forest. This was a nice experience although but I think it might have been our nursery guide's first tour as she did not seem to know anything but the \"driver\", Osiris, was plenty knowledgeable. Had an interesting moment on the return kayak trip as we saw a small crocodile of about 5 feet. Osiris said it was the first time anyone had seen one but it might make me think twice about snorkeling back to the resort, which is an option. Beach- Man made, rather small and just okay sand. Waters were fairly uninviting and I did not swim in the ocean. Could walk down the beach to another area that was better on one side but the other side is where one of the rivers empties to the ocean. This is a negative but the resort had about a dozen large beds on the beach to use which were very nice. Staff- Absolutely fantastic, can't say enough good things about all of the staff members. Always a smile, and a buenos dias from every single person that worked at the resort. If one of the lizards said \"Hola\" I would not have been surprised! All in all a very nice, new family resort that would make a nice vacation spot if you just want to chill out and have some great food and service. I had looked into this resort for a family with 4 adults and 2 younger kids and they do have a guaranteed connecting room option that would accommodate this size of family which is hard to find.", "Date": "October 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Franklin, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Service\u201d", "Author": "DanLisah1998", "ReviewID": "UR48126741", "Content": "Just returned from a 4 night stay at Tres Rios.

The decorations are a bit sparse but the linens are great, the beds comfortable and the bathroom was very nice, functional and lots of room. We had great maid service and great results with room service. In fact the overall service quality at this hotel was some of the best we have experienced anywhere in the world. We are frequent travelers having been previously to various resorts in Mexico (both coast), the Carribean and many destinations in the US. From the pool servers to the waiters to the maids to the concierge to the activity directors, everyone was exceptional, friendly and made our stay memorable. We dined in all restaurants and found all great. The beverage selections are first class and the menus varied enough to no doubt serve any taste. We experienced some very nice extras while at Tres Rios - A dinner by the pool with private entertainment, a chef's table tasting dinner and breakfast in bed one morning. These were simply first class, fun and very creative. We also had spa massages that were very relaxing and well done. The spa is not what you might see at say a Canyon Ranch but it's fine. We did notice construction ongoing but didn't really notice any exceptional amount of distraction. Special thanks to Chef (the Rock Star as we started calling him as he is a true ambassador fo the Tres Rios) and Hector our wonderful concierge for all they did to make our stay exceptional.

When the hotel is at capacity this will be a problem as the resturants/buffet are not large. Service and food in the resturants and at the pools was excellent. They really do need to add a rest room facility at the pool area closest to the beach along with a permanent bar (the rolling bar would often run out of things). The beach area was quiet and we were always able to get a bed on the beach I think this is because no one was in the water as the water is not the carribean blue you would hope for but it is clean. One of the main improvements I feel the hotel needs is more activities. If they want to continue to market this hotel as a family resort.

While the food was very good everywhere we ate, we never knew what was going to be open that night. One night, we planned to have a casual dinner buffet because we had been out all day and were exhausted. We went downstairs to find the buffet was closed. So we went to the Mexican restuarant, but they wouldn't let us eat there because my boyfriend was in khaki shorts (which were nicer than some of the other clothes I saw in the restuarant). Our only meal option that night was the grill outside. So we had to eat outside amongst the heat and swarm of mosquitos. We ended up rushing through our meal so we wouldn't get eaten alive my the mosquitos. A couple tips I found helpful: Bring bug spray (all natural if possible because you cannot get in the cenotes if you have on bugspray), when you get off the plane in Cancun do not stop an talk to the people that approach you in ties they are just trying to sell you timeshares, ask for a clear schedule of night time activites when you arrive, sign up for cenote tours early because they fill up", "Date": "October 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lancaster, PA", "Title": "\u201cIf you want to feel & look 10 years younger this is the place to vacation!!!\u201d", "Author": "Thereeses1047", "ReviewID": "UR43763570", "Content": "Wow this place was WONDERFUL!!!

HTR is a quiet serene place. If you are looking for a big raging party and a singles seen this is not the place for you. The property, pool, rooms and all of the facilities are beautiful and spotless clean. Many people have commented on the beach not being so nice but it is not that bad. The beach is fine and the beds are an interesting touch. The water is not the \u201cblue\u201d Cancun water and has some plant life in it. If you want to go into the water you can find places with sand. My wife had read about the \u201cbad\u201d beach and didn\u2019t go for the first 5 days. When she finally made it to the beach she was pleasantly surprised. The beach was almost always empty, with less then 10 people every time we went. Some of the biggest advantages of HTR are the cenote, river and grounds. We really enjoyed going to the cenote for a cool swim and using the kayaks. This is not something many resorts have and you must take advantage of this. One day my daughter and I kayaked from the ocean up stream to the cenote with our own snorkeling equipment. We left the kayak at the cenote and then snorkeled back down the river effortlessly with the current. A very unique experience! They also have a sail boat that you can take out or they will take you out at no charge. I found the food to range from ok to very good depending on the meal, restaurant and what you ordered. We felt that the specialty restaurants like the Asian Fusion and the Italian to be the best. Don\u2019t be afraid to go off menu and ask for whatever you want not just what is on the menu. Off Menu examples we had included; surf and turf at the grill, salmon at the grill, fettuccine with shrimp at the Italian. In general we thought the seafood to be some of the best food. We did tip many of the staff especially if they went out of their way to help us. Getting food and drinks at the pool was not difficult. Our drinks were rarely empty. I have read many comments about the price and value. Some people transferred their time share and then spent $150 a day pp for the all inclusive. We paid less then half of that including the room. I would consider this an incredible value for what we paid. I don\u2019t think we could find a better deal anywhere. Overall we loved it and would go back. I would like to point out some areas of improvement and how HTR could make some simple changes that would make guests stays better. It is very difficult to know what activities are going on each day and what the nightly show or event is going to be. They should have a board on the lobby of \u201cToday\u2019s activities\u201d. The staff doesn\u2019t even know and often needs to find out and get back to you. We had an issue with the lack of detail on the menu. We do not eat pork and my daughter ordered the lobster salad. The lobster came wrapped in bacon. They made her a new one without the bacon and we pointed out that the menu did not include the bacon much to their surprise. They need to somehow add a bathroom by the far pool near the beach. It is a long walk to the bath by the grill. (not sure how to solve that one) Some of the extras need more extras like the free DVD rental that has only 20 DVD\u2019s or the video game rental that has only 1 game. I was told that the games were stolen by someone who signed them out a month ago? Charge them and buy new ones, it shouldn\u2019t take a month if they want to be a 4-5 star resort.

Before going, I spent many hours reading all the reviews here on TripAdvisor, so I wanted to make sure I added my comments to help future travelers. We booked our trip via Bookit.com and found a great deal including airfare. We used Besttransfers.com for our roundtrip shuttle from the airport. Everything worked out great. We arrived on a Monday and were greeted at the front desk by name, along with a couple glasses of refreshing juice and towels. We were told the resort was at about 50% occupancy, but we didn't see more than 10-12 other people for a few days, owing to the fact that we arrived on a Monday in low season. We were quickly led to our room. All rooms have an ocean view. We stayed in the junior suite and it was quite spacious, with a king bed, sofas, Philips flat screen tv, large bathroom with separate toilet and a large walk-in shower. There is a digital safe in each room. Air conditioning was strong and our room was quite cold. The room was immaculate and very very comfortable. Outside, there are two large and shapely pools. There is a grill restaurant and also a pizza oven near the first pool. You can walk up and order something to eat. Most likely though, someone will come to your pool chair and take your order and deliver it. Here we have to give a special shout-out to Santiago, one of the servers who seemed to be EVERYWHERE and always asking how things were and if you needed anything. We saw him early in the morning and late in the evening. There are also beds on the beach, and these were wonderful for just spending the afternoon reading and enjoying the ocean breeze. The beds and beach are a bit of a walk to the grill/pizza, but Santiago popped up so we never moved a muscle. We saw the Mayan show and the Fire show and both were great. For dinner, your options are the grill and pizza place if you are outside, and the two indoor restaurants. One is the Mexican restaurant, and the other alternates between an Asian-type and Italian-type restaurant. Note that there is a dress code for the indoor dinners for the men: Pants with covered shoes. I did get away with a t-shirt and flip-flops though. Dinner was a la carte (order from about 8 entree items, plus appetizers) and each dish was presented beautifully. The quality of the ingredients were all very good, very fresh, very flavorful. Breakfast at the international restaurant was our favorite. There was a wide variety of foods and all were tasty. We never felt like any of the dishes were mass-produced--rather smaller portions were set out and constantly replenished so nothing sat out cold. Considering the low occupancy, I think they managed the food rather well and we never felt like we missed out on anything. To sum up, food was our favorite part of HTR, and everything was so full of flavor. We stayed four days, and on our second day we planned to drive out to the Coba ruins. I had done some stressing out regarding renting a car and getting the right required insurance. I was planning to take a taxi to Avis in Playa del Carmen and renting car from there. In the end, however, we ended up renting from the hotel itself (rental car office located on first floor near gift shop). We rented the smallest car with insurance, for a total of $60. Stress free. I agree with all the positive reviews this place has earned, they are well-deserved. * * * * * To address some of the concerns I've read about: -The resort is still new and in progress. Everything you need to enjoy your stay is finished (rooms, gym, restaurants, pools, etc.). However there is construction going on throughout the day and you do hear the sounds of hammers and power saws. It didn't bother us. -The beach directly in front of the resort is not your \"white sand/blue-green water\" beach. We understood this, since the freshwater rivers flow out directly next to the resort. The water isn't clear, but it's certainly not disgusting. Yes, you can walk 5 minutes to the south and get your nice beach. -Sales Presentation: we declined, and were glad we did. Our concierge Lety was very nice, and told us the presentation was not the hard-sell, and would take just two hours over breakfast. We were also offered many tempting gifts in return (private dinner on beach, or tours, etc.). However, we saw other couples who apparently decided to attend the presentation, and hours later still saw them following a rep around the resort, looking a bit wilted. NOT just a two hour breakfast. So, if you want the gifts, fine, but understand you will use up quite a few hours of a day to get them. We declined with no pressure or \"guilt trip\" and that was that. -As first-time AI'ers, we wondered about tipping. However, in the end we just tried to tip those who gave us personal service such as our dinner waiter and poolside servers. We also left a tip in our room for our maids.

The first trip we took in January 2009 and the resort was absolutely not ready for opening. Although we did not write on trip advisor in January 2009, mainly because we didn't know about it. This resort positively is now ready for primetime. The rooms were again very beautiful and slight changes, like the door mechanism system was changed and the cold/hot shower control was corrected so the kids couldn't get burned. Made a difference. We didn't have to go up to the room, and then walk back to front desk to get a new key this time at all. The food was amazing and the staff was SPECTACULAR. Starting with Pilar Gomez who is an amazing person and great manager of her people. They work together so beautifully that as a guest you see this daily at the resort, it makes you feel very comfortable. The Steinberg's arrived with seeing Pablo and Jesus at the front desk, very accomodating and informative without all the bull. We then got to our room where we found again a beautiful room. The pool was warm and the staff was ready to serve, except for one day on our trip did we not get the expected service at the pool. Only four people working the entire pool and beach area. Not a biggie though! Every other day was amazing. We went to the beach and found canopy beds sprawled over the beach. These were the highlight of the upgrades they did. Actually a place for you relax on the beach. A really awesome experience. Hector and Diana set us up on the tours for the week. Another two of the great MVP's at Hacienda. We got to meet Sergio, Andy, David, Carlos and Roberto of the activities division and they were all amazing. We went on the Cenotes tour and the bike tour which were both unbelievable experiences for your family. We recommend bringing BUG Spray on the tours. The CENOTE tour now incorporates the natural life and the nursery tour, which shows the kids how they used the devistation of the mangroves and put the wood to good uses. The designer plants and all the plant life throughout the resort. Truly Beautiful. The Steinberg's went on the HAcienda Tres Rios SENSES ADVENTURE, (you are blind folded) this should make people come from everywhere to experience. As this is like Kingda Ka at Great Adventure without the roller coaster. An amazing deep spiritual attraction that will leave you in a spiritual place like none before. THIS WAS TRULY AMAZING!!! The Mexican pizza at the pool is really good and the mai-tais, the kids drinks and the Mojito's are great. They now have pool water polo nets and volleyball games going on throughout the week. At 4PM each day the father's got to play adult soccer with the employees, and this was something we looked forward to each day. One day we took out the new hobie sailboats they have and went out to the ocean, the kids loved it. The kids club for my son and daughter was so much better this time than in January. Sylvia, Marcela and Marianna were awesome counselors. Talking about another MVP Most Valuable Player at Hacienda Tres RIOS besides Pilar, and staff is Oscar \"the executive Chef\". This guy is truly an awesome fixture at Hacienda. His staff of Samuel, Yvonne, Yanira, Carlos (2), Luis totally compliment the experience you are looking for. My son wanted to eat something different one evening and Oscar, Samuel, and Jose made sure that they made what he wanted. He was amazed that they can do this. The asian fusion restaurant and the italian restaurant were amazing. A different one opens every other night. They have the outside grill, which we chose to eat their with a night of little to no breeze and very hot. Everyone was soaked but the food was great. I told Jose to recommend putting fans outside on hot nights, that do not make noise. The mexican restaurant upstairs, the italian restaurant, the asian fusion, the outside grill and the buffet give you many choices. The casino night I took 500,000 and double down on the blackjack table and ended up with over a million dollars. The ending of the night they do an auction for prizes like tequila, shirts and bags. It is alot of fun. I was lending money to Sam from England who was very happy to get a shirt. We also had Karoake night which was alot of fun for all of us. We brought Neil Diamond to Mexico and the kids got a chane to sing Dancing Queen 3 times this night. Sergio and Marcella were great. They really let the kids do their thing. On another night they had the Mayan Fire Dance, which we thought was really cool being up and close to the dancers. Xcaret is much more elaborate, but they are really far away from your family. This was very nice. The welcome dinner was also nice to meet all the staff and get to guess Oscar's (the executive chef'sage) age which is 51. He will kill us for that one. It was an amazing trip and we never left the resort this time. I look forward to the next one soon.

I've traveled all around the world and I must say that this place has the best service of any other place I have stayed. The food is great and plentiful and the drinks are top-shelf. You want for nothing while poolside or on the beach. We felt like royalty and our family/group had an absolute wonderful time.

I would suggest before going to this resort that you bring enough singles (depending on your length of stay) to cover tips because this staff works extremely hard and is dedicated to ensuring that your stay is a wonderful one. Please tip, and more importantly, if you struggle with your spanish be patient because there is a slight language barrier with most of the staff. That language barrier contributed to some confusion surrounded some laundry we dropped off to get done. After misplacing over 2/3 of our laundry, we were surprised to find out that the resort charges by the \"item\" and not by weight. This led to a $450.00 laundry bill. We contacted our hotel rep (Steve), who is the man plain and simple, and the issue was resolved and the missing clothes were located. We accepted responsibility for not inquring in greater detail and the hotel accepted fault for the language barrier. Long story short, we agreed to split the cost and call it a day.

For example, there was nothing Mexican about the Mexican restaurant. My boyfriend ordered lamb, from the Mexican restaurant, and it was awful.

In the buffet area, we were asked several times by several different people what our room number was and one woman was very rude about it. The pool side food was pretty good.

Some people don't have them, those without all inclusive have one, people with day passes have a different color, and those with time shares have a wrist band depending on whatever. Maybe if everyone had a wrist band or if they made it all inclusive they wouldn't need to have a wrist band system and prices on the menu. I also noticed people with some wrist bands were paid better attention to, etc. I think considering how expensive this resort is, everyone should be treated well.

Now for the pros and cons of the trip. The Blueline shuttle was unclear to us. I thought our ride from the airport to HTR was payed for but it was not. $20.00 US per person and the guy pockets the money so we were not sure if we were getting ripped off. Turns out, the ride from HTR to the airport, as we were later told at the resort later is covered. But... we were told that it would be 58.00 US when we checked out. I explained the situation that had occurred to us and the fee was waved. When you check in you are immediately approached about setting up a time share tour. We always do the tours because we like the free gifts and it makes it worth it to us. I wish that it we weren't hit so early after our arrival however. At the airport we were also corraled by a time share tour. As we looked for our shuttle, the shuttle rep led us to the time share appointment maker to a different resort. We'll know to avoid that problem next time. Our room was exceptional. Marble tile floors throughout, three bathrooms, great views etc. The staff was very, very helpfull and friendly. The ground are very clean and fesh looking. The resort, we were told, is not really even officially open. We felt as the we had the whole place to our self!! Never did we have to search for a pool chair, towel, bed on the beach. What ever we wanted we had. The waiters had our drinks ready for us as we entered the pool or beach area! We rarely had to ask! They knew! Tipping is not required but as hard as the people worked I felt compelled at the end of the trip to sporadically leave tips. The food was good and changed frequently. Honestly though it was a little too gourmet for our liking. I guess the \"Gringo\" in us came out as we anticipated more tacos, burritos, fajitas and the like. If you wanted something not on a menu, all you had to do was ask. They would do their best to get it to you. The water at the beach is not at all like the photos on the web site. But they are working hard to beautify it. Never stopped us from swimming in it however.Speaking spanish is not needed but it does help. (Thank you Rosetta Stone) Overall, we will be returning to HTR.

I will start by saying that everyone on staff was wonderful. Front desk check in went nicely until we got a call about an hour later that they put us in the wrong room- we said we were fine and they still wanted to move us- we had already unpacked- they went to put us in the same room on a different floor but ended up giving us another room which had a hot tub- nice touch, but it didn't really come in handy in 90 degree weather. The all inclusive when you trade is about $149 pp/per day and comes to $170 when they add 12% tax. This really was too much especially if you compare it to other places in the area. We have stayed at many different all inclusives and this was by far the most expensive. We knew this but felt that there would be enough to warrant it - lots of restaurants, things to do... What you actually get really did not justify the cost. There are some on site \"tours\" included. Book right away. We stayed Sat. to Sat. We went to book the bicycle tour on Sunday and were unable to get in until Friday. (The resort was about 30-50% booked and has 6-8 bicycles). We met another couple who went to book on Wed. and was unable to get on a tour. You cannot take the bicycles on your own until you've gone on the tour. We did the kayaking tour which was a lot of fun- You can snorkel or ride in the kayak. There is another interesting tour which is an adventure for the senses- they should tell you that you should watch what you wear as some of the things used stained my clothes- the tour itself was worth doing- very different. The rooms are lovely and spacious. They have robes, blow dryers, irons, and small refrigerators they stock with some soda, water, and beer. They do nothing special in the rooms- We had a 2 bedroom- no cute little towel animals or decorations on the beds- they did not replenish conditioner, or even take the dirty towels on the floor one day. One bedroom did get a treat on the bed one night. These are small things and were not an issue for us, but at the price they ask, should not have occurred. As far as food, it is very good and there is nice presentation, but it really was very limited, especially for the cost. They have a buffet, a grill, a mexican restaurant, and an asian-fusion/italian (these two are in the same location on alternate nights but are both closed on Friday), a brick oven pizza place open during the day, and a small place to get little desserts or some finger food and coffee/espresso. The grill and buffet are open during the day- the grill is only open on Monday, Wed., and Fri. nights. Breakfast buffet was very good and staff was attentive. Lunch buffet was also good. Dinner buffet was okay- desserts were plentiful. There is one bathroom by the pool, but it is a little ways from certain pool sections. There is one bar by the pool closest to the hotel and one at the other end. There is one bar inside. During lunch hour, the people working around the pool must also work at the restaurant so drinks don't come as often. Although there weren't a lot of people at the resort, it did feel understaffed. Lots of umbrellas and chairs around the pool, but it did get dirty by the end of the week- bark and sand in the pool. This was evident by Thursday. It was nice that you always had towels available and didn't have to sign them out or in. Evening entertainment was good when they had shows. There was an outdoor gathering with a buffet. Service was very very slow- 25 min. to get water or any drinks- They had a great fire show. You can go down by the beach, but, as they will tell you, the water is brackish. Don't expect a typical caribbean beach. We knew this when we came and were fine with it. There were no real walking tours which would have been nice. We had a nice time with family but, for the money, they really need to do more - add some things to do during they day - there is not much for the kids to do at the pool but swim, unless you bring some pool toys- For the cost, they still need to step it up a bit- they definitely have potential but are just not there. I wrote I would recommend to a friend- if they were a Sunset owner and paying $99 pp/per day yes, but not for the $170.", "Date": "August 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bath ME", "Title": "\u201cA beautiful resort!\u201d", "Author": "jatwood44", "ReviewID": "UR36073750", "Content": "My sister and I stayed at HCR July 7-12, and we loved it!

Since we hadn't ever been to Mexico, we were flying blind, so we depended on the reviews that we read mainly here on Trip Advisor. I have to say that we were extremely pleased with our choice. Although this resort isn't completely finished, it was very beautiful and the staff was excellent. Checking in was very easy, and there was no crowd whatsoever. We were introduced to our personal concierge, and we were able to schedule some activities for the week, all part of the all-inclusive package. Additionally, she asked us if we would be willing to listen to a sales presentation. While we initially didn't want to do this, she offered us a $140 Mastercard debit card and a complimentary 75-minute couples massage for attending the presentation. We agreed to do so on our second day there. The presentation was grueling, and I truly don't understand why people would agree to do time shares. We said no from the beginning, but still were subjected to 2 hours of the presentation. Nonetheless, it was what we had agreed to do, and they fulfilled their promise, so we were on our way to our massage and soon the memory of the presentation was behind us. Our room was very elegant and clean - the bed was wonderfully comfortable. There is a small sitting area and a table, and the bathroom was perfect. Robes are provided, and the hairdryer was strange, as has been noted in many other reviews, but I brought my own. The minibar in the room is kept stocked and they are happy to bring whatever you want whenever you request it. The balcony overlooked the pools and the ocean, as they all do in this u-configuration. The pools are beautiful, and there is never any trouble getting a spot. The waitstaff constantly come around and bring whatever you request, both food and drink. The outdoor pizza oven provides delicious pizzas, and the other outdoor restaurant has excellent salads, shrimp, sandwiches, etc. They also make a killer guacamole. The chefs from the kitchen also circle with delicious appetizers throughout the day. The staff is always so happy to serve you, and go out of their way to get you all that you want and more. They would often bring two of everything, declaring, \"happy hour!\" The beds out on the beach are also great and luxurious, and always available. The staff is always changing the linens so that it is always fresh for the next guest. One of the most fascinating aspects of the resort is the rivers that feed into the ocean. There are a series of cenotes, which are spring-fed and cool, which then branch into rivers which flow to the ocean. It is worthwhile to do the cenote tours - both the one on bicycle and the kayak tour. The water in the cenotes is clear and beautiful, and the marine life is different than that in the ocean. It is an easy kayak trip down the river to the ocean, and it affords the opportunity to see the mangroves and enjoy some different scenery. The food is excellent. Both at the buffet and at the a la carte restaurants, the presentation is beautiful and the goal is to please. They will make things off the menu and bring them happily. Sometimes our waiters would surprise us with something special that they made for us. The head chef, Oscar, is a force to be reckoned with. I often thought that he must have a twin brother, as he was everywhere all of the time. He would breeze by the pool areas wearing his black pants and long-sleeved shirt and black head-wrap, never once sweating a bit. He had full command of the place, and always had time to stop and visit, and he would even take time if there was an empty glass to go himself and get a refill and bring it back to the table. We never had a bad meal. Just be sure to bring dressier attire (long pants and closed-toe shoes for men) to eat at the a la carte restaurants. Overall, it was a great trip. This is a resort for those who are looking for a quiet, romantic place that is not particularly a \"party\" spot. I would highly recommend it.", "Date": "July 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas", "Title": "\u201cClose to perfection\u201d", "Author": "BIGHAIRTEXAN", "ReviewID": "UR35703313", "Content": "We just got back from HTR last night. It was nothing less than fantastic. I am fairly well traveled and a very hard person to please (yes I've been called High Maintenance). So for me to give a 100% positive review is unheard of. We arrived in the late evening, were asked to be seated and then offered any kind of beverage we wanted while we waited. Check in was quick and it was suggested to us that we might want to eat first before seeing our room as it was well after 9PM. We went to Kotari, the Asian Fusion restaurant, were seated immediately and had a wonderful dinner.... very artfully presented. It was accompanied by some very nice wines. We then were escorted to our room which was very spacious and I'd call it elegant rather than opulent. The bathroom space is almost like 3 separate rooms. A shower room (great water pressure), a sink with the funny hair dryer, and the toilet room. Great towels and Teva bath and hair products. The room was kept stocked w/ sodas, water and beer and there was fruit in the room. We tried room service several times, seems we were always told \"Forty minutes\" but it always took less. Nice range of selections from sandwiches, pizza and pasta to grilled salmon, beef or chicken. Soups, salads and appetizers. Our room overlooked the river, the pool and had a view of the Caribbean which it seems pretty much all the rooms would have. We spent quite a bit of time on the balcony relaxing. The staff said they were at 80 percent occupancy. My daughter who is an exec w/ a boutique hotel company says that if they are at low occupancy, most hotels are told to exaggerate so I am a bit doubtful. I say that because at any given time there were more than ample chairs and umbrellas at the pools, and often I was the only person in a specific pool. Also the lovely king sized beds w/ the big pillows at beachside were always available. And YES the ocean is not very \"swimmable.\" Since the river flows into the sea on property the ocean water is full of debris from the trees/plants that are along the river. It's NOT disgusting trash or anything. It's natural plant materials. If you want to stay on the beach, the river that flows there is clear and much more refreshing anyway... and I am not a lake/river fan in general. The pools are on the warm side but not hot. While there, you can order from the bars, the wood fire pizza restaurant or the pool side grill. And it's not just burgers and dogs. It's shrimp and hot soups and cold soups and the BEST fries and salads. Sometimes we wrapped a towel around us and went for sit down service and other times we flagged down one of the wait staff and were served poolside. That brings me to another positive. Not ONCE did I ever make a request from anyone to be told \"Oh I'll get you a waiter... or Oh that's not my job.\" It seems as if you make a request and they'll do their best to accomodate you. For instance, at the fine Mexican restaurant, I asked if they recommended the deer or the lamb and I was told, \"Why don't you let me prepare for you a wonderful combination of both.\" And they did. I'd call for a wake up call and was asked \"Could we send something to you with your wake up? Some coffee? Some breakfast?\" Everywhere I went it was the same type of service. The staff seems to honestly be proud of the facility. I can't remember what I said to someone, but the waiter that overheard me said \"yes but it isn't as good as the hotel here.\" And I had to agree. Everyone smiles and says HOLA as they pass. We didn't participate in the Mexican Fiesta, but did catch part of the Mayan show and the Fire show. Yes there WERE mosquitoes. HELLOOO I was in the middle of the jungle w/ bodies of water all over. I brought some mosquito repellant wipes with me which I feel is much better than having an eco friendly resort going around spraying for insects all the time. Other than that, however, insects were not a problem. The cenote tours were fun and informative. Our group elected to float/swim down the river from the cenote to the beach, rather than kayak. I kind of felt like a scene from Jurassic Park, but it was refreshing and fun and I'd do it again in a heartbeat. The Italian restaurant was outstanding, the buffet a step above the average all inclusive buffet, and the patisserie was a nice break in the afternoon. The spa services were reasonably priced, the spa was attractive and the services quite good. I've never had better service or a more pleasant staff in anyplace I've stayed in any country. The facility is just gorgeous, the food excellent and the work they've done to keep from making a negative impact on the environment is commendable.

We spent a wonderful week at this resort with my husband's family (five of us total) in two beautiful connecting suites. Other reviewers were right on about the quality of the rooms! The beds are wonderful, the furniture is upscale and every room has a balcony overlooking the resort. The staff told us that there was 50 percent occupancy when we were there, but we guessed it was probably closer to 30 percent, which was very nice. We never had to worry about not getting the spot we wanted by the pool or waiting for meals. There were a lot of people in and out during the day on condo-buying tours, but it really wasn't a bother for us. The food was a true highlight of the trip. We ordered straight from the grill menu the first night, but once we got to know the wait staff (who were all so nice!) we would just ask them to bring us what they thought was good that night. As a result, we got a wonderful array of tasting plates, with five different salads, desserts, etc., and chef's pick on the main courses wherever we were eating. If you're looking for something in particular (for me it was scallops, for my father-in-law it was lobster) just ask, and if they have it, they'll bring it. We really enjoyed the outdoor grill, as well as the Italian and Asian fusion nights at the main indoor restaurant. Tip well and engage the wait staff, and you'll be treated supremely! I will say that brushing up on your Spanish would be a good idea before heading to Hacienda Tres Rios. It's not that you can't get by just speaking English, but both my husband and mother-in-law are fluent, and the staff seemed to appreciate even my poor attempts at speaking the language. Finally, as other reviewers have mentioned, the ocean is not the best, but I'm glad they've chosen to stay committed to their eco-conscious moto. We really liked the cenotes (the water up stream was clear and beautiful) and the pools were so pristine and refreshing that we didn't miss the ocean at all.

I have been to several all-inclusives and I never received this treatment...EVER! I I honestly don't know how some people could say such bad things about it! The beach is not great.....but this is because they are doing it the eco-friendly way. It may take a couple of years to get the beach \"like the other resorts\" in the Rivera Maya. They have to replant the correct plants to change the beach. They do not have straws in the outside bars and restaurants because they are not eco friendly. They do have them in the indoor restaurants! The food at the specialty restaurants is some of the best I have ever had.....every single dish is presented like a piece of art and taste heavenly! Another plus.....no draft beer! All drinks were canned Dos Equios and Tecate, great wine list and top shelf liquors. The hotel was not terribly crowed probably due to the economy, so this will change in the next year. They didn't have a whole lot of daytime pool activities but they didn't have enough people to have any major activities. They did have pool and beach volleyball everyday. I don't like to have a whole lot of activity when I am relaxing at the pool anyway, so this didn't bother me at all.

Through RCI we made our reservations for June 13-20th. The cost for my family of 4 was $3000. We usually stay at the Grand Velas or Velas throughout Mexico. These Resorts really are 5 star and are truly dedicated to making our vacations amazing. We read up on HTR and thought we\u2019d give it a shot being it was compared to the Velas. Hacienda Tres Rooms are one of the nicest we have stayed in. Our two bedroom suite was as amazing as any Mexico Resort can provide. I\u2019m still in awe over the beauty. There is only 1 bathroom for ALL 3 pool areas and the woman\u2019s bathroom does have its issues. There is no swim up bar only a \u201cpush\u201d bar with 1 Bartender/server providing service . The poor man was over worked. There needs to be bartenders (plural) and servers for food. The pizza took over an hour to receive and we had to eventually go get it ourselves. Activities are advertised on a weekly calendar for Bocci Ball, Volley Ball, Soccer etc\u2026the first 3 days not one activity person showed up. There is no music, competitions, or poolside games. It\u2019s really more of a sunbathing atmosphere. Needless to say my husband and two boys were bored and decided to go snorkeling at Akumal Beach. The Sports Bar is fun in the evenings\u2026Joel the bartender isn\u2019t very nice. One evening we ordered 5 shots and I was told to collect all the shots glasses myself if I wanted them. I didn\u2019t expect that from a 5 star Resort. We told Mario our server about it and he made sure to take care of us for the rest of our stay!!! Ask for Mario and he\u2019ll give you the 5 star treatment!! Thanks Mario!! The Internet Cafe is fun and savy. There are two laptop computers available to use , Xbox 360 games and dvds to check out . In the adjoining room is coffee, hot chocolate and snacks served daily. The Foyer is grand and cool. Very relaxing, If there were a bar inside it would make it even better. The Sports Bar Bartender was never available during the day to order drinks from. The complimentary 30 min. massages do cost $12. I did receive a complimentary 1 hour massage. This really was the best massage ever! The gym facility is state of the art. The food is Gourmet. Don\u2019t expect big portions, but you can always order more if you want. Order the ice cream it\u2019s AMAZING. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask for the Surf n Turf, which is lobster and shrimp! At the pool ask for anything you want, you don\u2019t have to order what is on The Grill menu. Also, if you\u2019re a vegetarian there is a special menu for that as well. Room service is also another way to go. They always delivered within 20-25 minutes tops. The beach is not what you would want for this region of Mexico. Though they are trying to clean it up. If you walk over to the left across the bridge and past the cenote you\u2019ll come to a GORGEOUS beach! We snorkeled there to a reef and saw some amazing fish. The cenote tour was fun and would def recommend this. We couldn\u2019t do the bike tour because our son was to short for the bike. The cenote across the bridge is breathtaking. We saw crab, eel, and many other types of fish. Don\u2019t be afraid to adventure over there. You\u2019ll miss out if you don\u2019t!! They handed out a questionnaire for us to fill out on our third morning. It consisted of ratings and comments of our opinions on HTR. I addressed every concern we had and am pleased to write the next day the poolside service, activities and drinks/food were top notch. It was great to have management truly dedicated to customer service and address the problems needed. We met some incredible families during our stay at HTR.

We just came home from a 7 day stay, and I really hated to leave and am still missing HTR. The staff is just wonderful in every way, That is something truly unique about this hotel. Everyone from the concierge, waiters, activity staff, to the construction workers who are working on another building have a big smile and Hola! to you. The food is generally very good, but sometimes a little hit or miss. I could have done without the cricket empanadas. We never did see the mythical Oscar, perhaps he was vacationing elsewhere? The nightly entertainment was very nice and fun. Much better than expected. The Mayan show and the fire show were standouts. The included tours are not to be missed and are fun and low key. We loved snorkeling down the Rio Selva and another day Kayaking it both ways. Our room was huge and had a great view and jacuzzi on the large balcony. Everything was perfect and new and clean. My only tiny complaint is the pool bathroom is a big hike from any of the pools. It is small and for some reason the women's houses something that looks like a mainframe computer behind glass. Consequently it is usually about 150 degrees in the bathroom and not the pleasantness experience after the long hike. My feeling is there will be a nicer and closer pool bathroom in the seafood restaurant (which is not yet open). Also there is no real pool bar, although a cart is rolled out everyday and there is certainly no problem in getting a drink. It seems odd that one wasn't included in the initial plans. Other than those tiny things, all the facilitiy and ground are beautiful and spectacular. During our stay there may have been 50 people at the resort and the it was very much like having some fabulous multimillionaires estate to yourself.

As so many others have said from the moment we arrived everyone was so friendly and helpful. First and the main reason I am writing this review is to compliment and thank the Activities Team especially Berenice, Roberto, Osiris and Silvia for taking such great care of our 6 and 7 year old daughters. The girls got to experience so many more things than if we just kept them with us the whole time. And when Roberto would see us anywhere on the property he always fussed over the girls to make them feel special. As most other reviews have mentioned all of the Restaurant Hostesses and Servers are great always greeting you with a big smile and friendly service. I would like to thank a few first there is Ms Veronica I think she was everywhere and always with that big smile. Speaking of smiles we met William our first night and he always went out of his way to say Hola. Raul, Evan, and Bonifacio served us many times with smiles and extra efforts. When we first arrived we were welcomed by Ingrid the Sunset VIP Concierge and throughout our two week stay we relied on her to answer all of our questions. Of course it took us a few days to realize that some of the time it was her twin sister Astrid. They were both Great \u2013 Thanks. We also spent a pleasant day with Magnus at breakfast and the sales center and please note I meant it when I started by saying it was a Pleasant Day. I have not heard if Angelina has arrived yet but Magnus and his wife and daughter are in our thoughts and prayers. Can\u2019t close this review without mentioning Chef Oscar what a professional I am not impressed easily but when the special guest was on-site the first week of June he was everywhere it is a pleasure to see someone that is so good at what they do.

We're pretty familiar with the Riviera Maya (we honeymooned in Tulum a few years ago), but we've never stayed at an AI--we usually stay at hip boutique hotels. We were drawn to HTR due to the combo of modern/new decor, a great deal on Orbitz, the good reviews, and the fact that we could do outdoorsy things (kayaking, snorkeling) without leaving the grounds. We have a toddler that we left at home with my folks, so we wanted a stress-free non-schleppy vacation, and this is exactly what we found at HTR. The beauty of the place is that it's blissfully empty. The concierge claimed they were at 50% capacity, but we estimated about 100 people were there when we were (if that). We never had to wait for anything. There were tons of lounge chairs, umbrellas, and gorgeous beach beds--no lines, reserving chairs, or reservations for dinner. Often my husband and I were the only people in or around any one of the pools, and we felt like we were millionaires with our own private resort. There are two gorgeous pools--one saltwater (that's more of an activities pool), and one freshwater that's more of a grownup pool (and has shaded alcoves). The beach is actually seaweed-free (the staff rakes it religiously), and is lovely to look at from the beach beds--the water (as everyone has said) is not so fab to swim in as it's murky, and the whole week we were there the shore was red-flagged. We walked to the right, and the beaches weren't much better at the Blue Bay or any of the other resorts (some of which were closed and piled with mountains of seaweed). We did a kayaking tour of one of the cenotes and one of the rivers, and the cenote was lovely to swim in--clear and cold--and we took the kayaks out on multiple days on our own to explore a bit. Definitely do at least one of the tours! The resort gives out masks, but if you really want to snorkel, you should bring your own snorkel, as they don't have these to give out (hygiene issues maybe?). We had wanted to take bikes out too, but it was just too hot. The gym is beautiful, and has tons of brand new machines (cardio and weight), and is air conditioned. The food: the presentation was very luxe (in the restaurants our food was always built into towers with various artfully drizzled sauces) and the service at the a la carte places was always outstanding (and the waiters were super-nice). The actual food was good overall, though a bit hit-or-miss from dish to dish. We had many really incredible dishes, and also some that were just \"eh\" or even super-bland (especially when it came to desserts). It really depended on what you ordered from meal to meal. The best bets were usually the fish or seafood/shrimp (the pork and chicken I tried were generally tough/over-cooked). I had some wonderful shrimp in the fancy Mexican place, and also in the Italian place (with squid ink risotto). Also the beef fajitas and fish tacos at the grill outside (at night) were excellent. We never saw or met the mythical chef Oscar that everyone talks about in their reviews, nor was there ever lobster. We did discover by the second day, though, that if you wanted something that wasn't on the menu they would happily make it for you (so we often ordered chips and guacamole, or fajitas and quesadillas for lunch instead of the mediocre pizzas or burgers). The breakfast buffet was fine, though not outstanding. We ate really well though, and often would order 3 appetizers or an extra entree in the first few days just to see what was good. Our least favorite restaurant was the Asian for dinner. The best (for dinner) were the fancy Mexican place, the Italian, and the outdoor grill. The ground of this place are lush and amazing. Our room was spotlessly clean, brand new, and gorgeous. The beds were great. They claim to have a pillow menu, but when I called they just offered me a memory foam pillow (as opposed to a feather one on the beds). The staff always, always greeted us with smiles. There is still some construction going on, but we never ever heard it and it didn't bother us at all. The few downsides and/or weird things: The crowd at the resort was sort of random--couples on romantic vacations, giant families with kids, groups of college kids, a large contingent of Mexican grandmothers, etc. It wasn't entirely clear who they were catering to (or maybe this just made it diverse?), but combined with the constantly touring groups of timeshare folks (who never bothered us, but brought groups to look around pretty regularly), it made the vibe at the resort a little weird. The college kids were a huge disappointment--each night my husband came out of the lobby bathroom to tell me that there was someone throwing up in there--and they sort of commandeered the sports bar. At a resort of this caliber, I didn't expect that. The staff rolled a martini bar out to the terrace for two nights when we were there (which was awesome), but it was never clear to us when it would be there, or how long it would be out for (and it got rolled back in the second night before we managed to get there). Which brings me to one issue we had--we were never entirely clear on what was going on (e.g. restaurants would be open on nights that weren't on the schedule, or tours would be moved by a few hours, etc.). There's also not much to do at night (except for the nights there are shows, like the fire show). The second issue was with our room--the rooms are pretty soundproof, except in the place where there's a door to connect it to the next room. We had a junior suite. All the junior suites are connected to other rooms so they can be joined to make two-room suites. We were fine in our suite when there was no one next door to us, but on our fifth day we got a really loud group of 4 next door and we could hear them really clearly through the door. Luckily Pablo at the front desk was amazing, and was able to move us to a room with no one next door to us. Thanks Pablo! I wonder if this would be such a neat place for a romantic getaway, though, if it were more crowded? It does seem to be an excellent place for groups or families for the very same reason though. Overall, we had a great and relaxing time, mostly due to the excellent staff at HTR.

Still undecided on this place. Do not get me wrong everything was wonderful. The food was good. The buffets were okay, but we love to cook. If you eat fast food a lot you may think it is better than good. You must try the speciality dining ( be sure to bring long pants). The food in those was exceptional. Try the fried crickets in the Mexican. The pool is awesome, the cenotes are mucho fun. The grounds are very beautiful and well taking care of. The staff is very good. Nothing at all to complain about EXCEPT... The ocean in front of the resort is not really the colors that one hopes for in this part of the world. About 2 hundres yards offshore the colors are nice, but i believe due to the mangroves around the resort you get a dark runoff into the water. It was fine to swin in and some days were better than others, but not the true azzure waters that we travel to Playa for. We did spand a day in Play and Coz and the water there is very impressive. The kids were blown away by the blues... Again I must say the beach is fantastic and they just planted a jungle of trees that in a year or so will be even more impressive. I just love the blue waters and swimming in the surf... The is no surf here. The other thing we talked about is how the service was so good everywhere. But that may have been due to the fact that there were only 17 families in the resort for most of the week. Not sure they could maintain that as the resort fills up. Be sure to enjoy the tours and everything the place has to offer. The kids painted their own pottery which was fun for them, but a bit expensive. Some families had the little kids and the kids club appeared to be well run and a lot of fun for the little ones. If this is a vacation to just relax and just be waited on , this is the palce for you... Oh by the way the rooms are A plus,plus ..along with the room service feature. A few other points... You do not have to take the timeshare presentation. Book your tours yourself, online or on at the destination. The hotel concierge had us booked for snorkeling for $59 each and we cancelled and found the tour for $20 in Playa. I am sure a bit of that is also do to the low occupancy at ALL the resorts. I think I agree with the previous review about Oscar, nice guy. But always running around smoozing.

Dallas was pleasant enough but did nothing to ensure our vacation was improved.

My bank is pursuing charges. Then I spoke with Jose, the customer service rep. who also promised to comp us a vehicle so we could take a day trip to Tulum and I had to call him at home on the day of the \"promised\" free vehicle to insist that he keep his word. He never followed through with leaving word, or attended to my guests dissatisfaction. Oscar the \"Head Chef\" was more into smoozing the guests than providing quality food. At one point we asked for a simple order of Calimari and we were given a rubbery pile of sauce covered over cooked yuk. Now let me say, that one of my guests is a Chef herself- and we all cook well in our home lives, so this was a complete flop. I was tempted to go back and cook myself.

The tiled shower was nice. The bed was very comfortable along with the linens. Every room, from what I could tell would have a view of the ocean. Ours was on the top floor and we could see all pools and had a great view of the ocean. We enjoyed all of the restaurants except we didn\u2019t have the opportunity to eat at the Italian Restaurant. Our favorite was probably the Asian Restaurant. For lunch, we usually had one of the fabulous pizza and then later grabbed a few snacks at the Grill. I normally don\u2019t like guacamole but it was great there and we had it everyday. The spa was ok \u2013 the massages were great but I think they still are in a temporary location. We always went to the pool closest to the ocean. You didn\u2019t need to worry about getting down there early to put a towel out. There were empty chairs and umbrellas everywhere. It was definitely a relaxing atmosphere. They had a temporary bar setup by this pool (the Grill was the bar by the other pool) and servers were walking around. Most of the time, the service at the pool was good. We were told they would eventually be putting in a pool bar which would be an excellent addition. They had nightly entertainment\u2026.a casino night, fire show, Mayan night, etc. They were entertaining. The Cenotes, Kayaking, and other activities are worth the time and something you would normally pay for at other resorts. They had Absolute, Absolute Mandarin and Stolichnaya Vodka, Crown Royal, Jack Daniels, and many brands of Tequila to drink. Dos Equis and Tecate were the beers I had. I didn\u2019t see any Captain Morgan\u2019s but they had Jamaican Rum. It wasn\u2019t a \u201cparty\u201d spot so if that is what you want I wouldn\u2019t recommend the place, but if you want a relaxing resort, very good food for an AI, nice rooms with the best service, you can\u2019t go wrong with Tres Rios.

We got a very good promotional rate through orbits.com for ten days and loved everything the hotel Hacienda had to offer with a few exceptions. Before we took our trip the question for us and many travelers how is the beach by the hotel, by the reviews I could not understand if it was swimmable. The beach in the front of the hotel is very upsetting it has a reef which brings in lots of seaweed and other debris and is not pleasant at all for swimming. There where people cleaning all this dirt all day long. But if you walk along the beach coast line for about five minutes the water is great to swim with blue water and white sand. One of the impressing parts of the beach is the beds they have situated along the property; they are the best looking beds in all of Riviera Maya stretch and very luxurious and comfortable. I am not a big lover of tanning but I laid out every morning enjoyed the sun and fresh wind. We arrived at the hotel late and our room that we requested a suite with a king size bed was not available, my husband was upset do to he had called a day prior to confirm the reservation. The front desk was so accommodating they gave us an upgrade without any questions, our room a suite was on the third floor with a Jacuzzi on the balcony and an amazing view which every morning we watched the sun come up. The next day we meet Hector the hotels PR who is great he sent us a bottle of champagne and was very accommodating with any question we had, but the main man in Tres Rios is Oscar the head chef I think he works 24 hours we saw him morning and night socializing and preparing great dishes for the hotel guests. The food is very good from the morning breakfast to lunch and dinner we enjoyed every meal. We live in NYC and are very spoiled with the variety of gourmet food we have, but for an all inclusive I was very surprised; everything is fresh with quality and good variety. Try the rib eye steak on Mondays barbecue and the Italian black ink risotto in the main restaurant. They also have seafood barbecue on Thursday; we had lobster and big shrimp for which my husband enjoyed but a bit dry for me. The Mexican food was just OK a bit boring. There are a great variety of drinks, frozen or on the rocks everything is good you won\u2019t be disappointed. The staff is superb anything we asked of they accommodated, very friendly and well trained from the hotel on service and professionalism Hacienda offers fun tours on their property with your stay, like the jaguar tour, it includes kayaking, snorkeling in the senotes and sightseeing either with bikes or walking. My husband swam in the senotes which he described amazing life in the water below, while I enjoyed the scenery. We rented a car right from the property (bargain the price) and went to see the ruins of the Mayans in Tulum, beautiful torques beaches in Cancun and the fifth avenue of Playa del Carmen all in a day\u2019s trip and had an amazing time shopping sightseeing and swimming. Hacienda Tres Rios is a private place with evening shows like the Sunday welcome party with Mexican food and music, nicely set up with lots of margaritas and entertainment. Do not miss the Mayan show on Monday, very well done and the OK fire show on Tuesday. Wednesday they have casino night which you play with funny money and have an auction for bottles of tequila for which my husband had won. HURRAY!!

The property: beautiful and sprawling with the perfect balance of resort accomodations and eco-friendly preservation. The hotel features are grand yet tasteful, the rooms are large and well appointed with flat screen TV, DVD player, well-stocked fridge and wonderful linens! All with a beautiful ocean view. My only comment is with the beach, which we had read about before visiting. Yes, the ocean is murky and needs some serious care to restore the true blue tropical lustre that you have in Cabo, Playa Del Carmen and Cancun. The sand itself is gorgeous and well maintained with the big comfy beds on the beach. Over the 7 days, we never went in the ocean at the resort but did go in at Tulum and while visiting the Sunset Fisherman in PDC. The people: Head Chef Oscar runs the show; charming, personable and in command, he is a real treat! It's his staff and service that is solid and makes the resort a real gem! Everyone went out of their way to answer questions, accomodate our requests and make us feel at home. While service is slower than US standards, remember you are on vacation in Mexico, so just go with the flow and order two drinks at a time. The food: Back to Oscar; he exceeded our expectations!! A solid line up of options throughout the day including a gourmet Mexican and Italian restaurant, buffet, poolside grill, wood fire pizza oven and 24/7 room service! We ate at every location, tried practically everything and were extremely statisifed with each meal. . . you may want to prepare yourself for the crickets though. Entertainment: While the property is still young, less than 6 months old and only about 60% complete the property was quiet and tranquil during the day and the evening entertainment was well planned and wonderfully executed.

This was our first time taking our kids to Mexico, and we were anxious for the experience to be a good one for everyone. We could not have been more pleased. Check-in was smooth, and our room was exactly as promised. We arrived on a hot day, and after many hours of travel, the cold towels and champagne were a welcome sight. They had shirley temples for the kids, and the staff couldn't have been more gracious and inviting. The pools were beautiful and huge - their winding form makes for many tiny \"inlets.\" I'm guessing it would not feel crowded even if the hotel was completed and full. We often felt like we had the resort practically to ourselves, even though there were nearly 200 guests on property. Except for one meal (the seafood dinner by the pool one evening), the food was consistently fantastic - absolutely not what I usually read about the food at all-inclusives. We ate everywhere except the a la carte Asian restaurant, and all were super. Although I loved the breakfast buffet, we ordered room service breakfast twice and loved the beautiful poached eggs and fabulous fruit plates. We also ordered room service for afternoon \"snacks\" a few times - smoked salmon, coconut shrimp, chicken quesadillas - not your typical snack fare, and fantastic every time. The soups were always wonderful - cold soups by the pool, hot soups at dinner. Some of my very favorites during the week: eggs poached in tomato sauce (buffet breakfast), \"oats with milk\" (buffet breakfast), white sauce pizza (wood pizza oven), grilled shrimp (Hacienda Grill), cold tomato and cucumber soups (Hacienda Grill), tenderloin salad (Hacienda Grill) creme brulee (a la carte Mexican), stuffed veal (a la carte Italian), pear tart (dinner at Hacienda Grill), coconut shrimp (room service), smoked salmon plate (room service), and all the burgers at the Hacienda Grill - American (not on the menu), Mexican and Sea Bass. The staff is a true highlight of the resort. They obviously love where they work, and they are thrilled to share their \"home\" with you. I know I will forget some of our new friends, but a few to note... Sergio was a wealth of information on our nursery/cenote tour, and we had lovely conversations with him throughout the week; the girls in the Kids Club were lovely and wonderful, and I can't thank them enough for trying to involve the kids in their activities; Francisco (ciao, Franco!) was a hoot and wanted everyone to be busy...but didn't hold it against us if we just wanted to lay by the pool; Oscar was delightful and certainly went out of his way to make sure things were running smoothly - and we certainly loved his food. To a person, the staff were friendly, smiling and ready to make our week memorable. Occasionally we had a service issue with something taking a while to arrive or not arriving without a reminder, but I've come to expect that in Mexico to a certain extent, and we didn't let it bother us. We visited Fisherman's one day and could not get back to Hacienda Tres Rios fast enough. The nicest thing I can say about Fisherman's is that it made us appreciate where we were. There were 6 of us in our group, ranging in age from 60'ish to 8, and we all had one of our best vacations ever.

Our vacation began after a short 25 min drive from the airport to be greeted by our first names and champagne (apple juice for baby) and cool towels. The hotel is just as gorgeous and pristine and new as the photos depict. I was so pleased with the style, comfort and most importantly to me, the cleanliness, that I didn't think anything of my toddler rolling around on the ground of our room. The rooms were well equipped with flat screen tvs, dvd/cd players, soft beds with very nice linens/lots of pillows, sofa/living room area, jacuzzi on the balcony and spacious bathrooms with waterfall showers. The rooms were cleaned on time every day and we had turn down service with fancy towel art my daughter loved and homemade candy each night. The food was wonderful (think gourmet, not Chinese buffet bar) yet plentiful. The restaurants were open 7-11 am for breakfast; 11:30-4:30 for lunch; and 6:00-11:00 for dinner; plus there is 24 hour room service, prompt and served with a smile; pizzeria at the pool; grill at the pool; and a internet cafe so to speak with cappucinos and desserts and hors d'oevres all day. You could also get a drink any time of day at one of the bars or room service or your mini-bar...all included. More importantly, the resort was the perfect size such that walking from point a to point b was no problem. No golf carts or shuttles required here. The pools were gorgeous and again, pristine. The beach and the beds just perfect, with a gorgeous cenote area where the river meets the sea. The biggest perk of this hotel was the AMAZING STAFF. These people were so genuine, so thoughtful, hard working and friendly. They always greeted us with a smile and always asked what they could do for our daughter, and for my husband and I too. For example, one night my husband was asked by our waiter what his favorite food was and he replied filet; the next day at dinner, he was brought a tasty filet! Similarly, the night before we left, Chef Oscar asked my husband when we were leaving and what we would enjoy for breakfast. Even though the kitchen usually only opens for breakfast at 6 am, we were greeted at 6 am on the dot with delicious room service breakfast for 3! One evening when my daughter was particularly uncooperative with sitting at the dinner table, they moved a sofa to our outside table so my active toddler could \"play\" and eat alongside our table. When we were heading to the beach, we realized we didn't bring toys for baby -- no problem! The Kids Club gave us toys for our little to use. I could go on and on about these wonderful people -- Chef Oscar, Jose, Francisco, Syvia...to many to name and remember! Just trust me on this one -- we are well traveled and are confident that you will be pleased. On a side note, we did tip our staff -- but if you don't think you should do this at an all-inclusive, then I respectfully disagree. These people work hard for you and deserve something for there efforts. Nobody nickels and dimes you here, nor waits around expecting a tip, but it's the right thing for guests to do.) Honestly, I only have one issue with the hotel and it is something I know they are working on. The water at the beach has issues -- seaweed/grass that has bloomed since recent hurricanes which makes the water unswimmable and frankly only good for observing from the beach beds or your balcony (it is pretty from there). The upside is you can walk down the beach and find much nicer, blue water; or if you rent a car like we did (driving is cake on the 307 highway which is like a 3 lane state highway) and drive 10 minutes south to Playa del Carmen or even explore the gorgeous beaches of Akumal and Tulum. We would do this after breakfast in the morning and return around 1 pm, have lunch and drinks at the pool, go for a swim, take a siesta then go to the martini/tea deck, then dinner, then evening entertainment of live music and mingling with other guests and our friendly staff. The water being gorgeous would have made this hotel perfect, but even with this limitation, it was a completely marvelous vacation retreat. We had absolutely NO issues with timeshare solicitations or any pushiness described in some of the other posters comments. Frankly I looked at the worst reviews before we booked and went on this vacation, and now having been to this resort, I am shocked at some of the complaints. Either these people went before the resort was fully up and running (and probably went for free on a RCI timeshare promotion) or these are terribly grumpy and scroogelike unpleasables -- these are the only possible explanations! Look, if you're looking for a classy place without pretention and without noise/crowds/grime; if you're looking for a place where you'll be treated like a family member; if you're looking for beautiful surroundings and relaxing opportunities (kayaking, massages, swimming, music, great food and drinks -- this is your place.

Once we made our reservation, we anxiously looked at the reviews and forum posts on Tripadvisor and were amazed and concerned about the range of reviews and the contrast between the submissions. We have therefore submitted a longer than normal review to give our opinion of this new resort. Check in did not go smoothly. When we arrived around 2::00 PM our room was not ready and we found that check in time was 3:00PM. I reminded them that we had requested a room with a king sized bed and was told that \u201cwe would love our room\u201d. When I returned around 3:15, it was still not ready, I again asked to make sure it was a king sized bed and was again told that \u201cwe would love our room\u201d. Around 3:30 PM, our room was ready and it was not a king sized bed. They did agree to change it later but it was a little frustrating. You do not get a wrist band unless you own a time share via RCI or Hacienda Tres Rios (HTR). I think it is purple for RCI and Orange for HTR. Since we do not own a time share, every time I went to a restaurant I was asked my room number and when I returned to the hotel after walking the beach I was sometimes asked my room number. That was not a problem. The hotel is situated on a beautiful site that was formerly a nature preserve. The main building contains what appears to be 60% or more of the hotel rooms, the main restaurants and the spa/gym. This building is completely finished. There are about 2 other buildings under construction with additional hotel rooms that are framed but still need a lot of work. The ongoing construction was NOT noisy and did not cause any problems. There are two main free form pools with plenty of chairs. Next to the pool closest to the hotel is the grille which has outdoor dining and a bar. On the other side of the pool is an outdoor wood burning stove where you can get pizza or calzones. There is also a rolling bar situated at the far end of the pool adjacent to the beach. The beach has a sufficient number of chairs and large outdoor beds that were always available. There were umbrellas for some of the chairs around the pool. Adjacent to the far pool were three hot tubs with different temperatures. There were waiters around the pool to bring drinks or pizza but the service was sporadic. It was the one weak link in the otherwise excellent service at the hotel. The pools were not as cold as previous reviewers mentioned (maybe we are used to the cold being from Mass.). When the sun is hot it was actually refreshing to cool off in the pool. We did not notice \u201cwading areas\u201d for kids but there was a section of the pool that the \u201ckids club\u201d would visit so that must have been a shallow part. The beach is wide but the sand is a little course. While we were there, there was no seaweed on the beach. The water was \u201cchurned up\u201d. Due to the waves and wind, the water was not crystal clear like in the Caribbean. Do not expect to stand in the water and \u201csee your feet\u201d. People did swim in it all along the patch of beach that we walked. There is a lot of erosion on the beaches at nearby hotels. A fifteen minute enjoyable walk towards Playa del Carmen had water that was clearer if you need a \u201cocean fix\u201d. When we were there, the hotel was between 40% and 70% full, depending on who you spoke to at the front desk (that was of the available rooms). As a result, you could eat at whatever restaurant you wanted almost at any time and there was never a problem getting a chair at the pool or the beach. That was one of the nicest things about our stay. Often while on vacation , it is a problem getting dinner reservations or a hassle getting a chair at the pool but it was a pleasure not having to worry about that. We usually do not look for entertainment while on a beach vacation so it is not an issue for us. For those of you that are looking for it, there was something going on each night but since there were not many people there, it was low key. They had a Mexican fiesta with a maharachi band, a casino night with \u201cgambling\u201d, karaoke night (twice) and fire dancers. The hotel is 6 miles, which is about a half hour from Playa del Carmen (there is a lot of traffic). There is lots to do at night in Playa if you are so inclined. The hotel offers a free shuttle during the day to and from Playa that goes to Sunset Fisherman which is on the far end of Playa near Fifth Avenue. (I have read that if you are staying at HTR you can enjoy reciprocal privileges there but was told that it only applies to RCI owners). A cab is 140 pesos. Since it is located on a former nature preserve, one of the prime assets of the hotel is the keynotes (small natural bodies of water), the plant and nursery and the kayaking. There are three different tours that you can take or you can use the kayaks by themselves if there are any on the shore of the river near the beach. We went on two of the tours and enjoyed them. We would recommend any guest staying at the Hacienda take the Nursery and Ceynotes tours. It\u2019s part of the charm of the resort. One of the best features of the hotel is Oscar, the head Chef. I joked with him that I did not believe he was a chef, but that he was an actor hired to play a chef and interact with the guests. He was everywhere, at each restaurant, breakfast lunch and dinner and I even saw him during a tour of the ceynotes. He was great for customer relations and was always asking if everything was fine and if he could do anything for you. That being said, the food was good but not perfect. In addition to the grille and pizza oven by the pool, there are three other restaurants. The main restaurant is a buffet. Adjacent to it is an ala carte restaurant that was open most nights and alternated between Italian and Asian. Also, two nights the grille was open for dinner, one night for steak and the other for grilled seafood. I rarely eat at buffets but did eat here a few times. It was pretty good. Instead of large quantities of food in warming trays, the concept here is to have not too big platters of food that are constantly being changed. Sometimes, the food would change during the meal. Since the hotel was not full, this was a great system. It would be interesting to see how that will work with 3 times as many people. We ate at the Italian restaurant twice and we also ate twice at the gourmet Mexican restaurant twice. The food in both places was interesting and well prepared and the service was great. My biggest complaint was that the meat at all of the venues was not very good. The lamb chops at the Mexican restaurant were tough and inedible. The steaks were very thin and not up to the standard you would accept. Also, instead of butter with your rolls, they served little packets of unappealing margarine. I am not a big breakfast eater but the orange juice was fresh and they had a nice selection of fruit. My wife loves breakfast and noted that sometimes there would be pancakes or French toast but not all the time. There is an omelet station and we found they would also make French toast if requested. If there\u2019s something you want and it\u2019s not on the menu, ask. Chances are they can make it for you. There is 24 hour room service but we never ordered it. There are no snacks in the room and it would have been nice to have some available. There is a place for pastry off the lobby that is open at night that was a nice touch. The gym was fine with about ten cardio stations, recumbent bikes, trotters elliptical cross trainers and some machines for lifting weights. There were two flat screen machines but when the trotters were in use you could not hear anything. Since the hotel was not near capacity, I was always able to access whatever equipment I wanted at any time. We each had a massage at the spa, which was appropriately decorated and equipped for a hotel of this nature. The rooms were large and comfortable. My wife and I disagreed on the quality of the sheets. I thought they were fine but she thought they were somewhat scratchy. Towels both at the pool and in the room were plentiful. The bathrooms are spacious and the shower is big. The only complaint about the bathroom my wife had was with the hair dryer. It was a long tube with very little power. We suggest you bring a travel hairdryer. They can be used there. No special plugs are necessary. There is free wifi throughout the hotel that worked seamlessly and two public computers in the \u201cexit lounge\u201d off the lobby. In conclusion, we had an enjoyable and relaxing vacation. Although it is not at the highest level we have seen in Mexico, it has great potential and all of the staff was very friendly and anxious to help every guest enjoy their stay.", "Date": "April 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "The Woodlands, Texas", "Title": "\u201cWhat a treat!\u201d", "Author": "ChicaDulce131", "ReviewID": "UR26835485", "Content": "I just returned from Hacienda Tres Rios with my husband and nine year-old daughter.

I could go on and on about the food. I am scared to step on a scale after this trip! The pools are beautiful and everyone has plenty of space to have their own piece of privacy. The beach is pretty and as a bonus, there are comfortable beds and lounge chairs. My husband really enjoyed snorkeling in the river where it meets the beach. If I had to come up with a con about this hotel, I would say that the beach had a lot of plant life near the surface. Because of the excessive plant life, the water isn\u2019t as pretty as it is at most of the other Riviera Maya resorts. I was wishing that I had asked if they could do anything to improve on that. My guess is that they will work on that. Other than not being a great swimming beach, it was still lovely and we enjoyed it. At the Kids Club, Argelia and Berenicia work very hard to treat the kids to a fun and special vacation. My daughter enjoyed going on a Garden Tour, visiting a Cenote, canoeing, swimming, playing Croquet, making crafts, etc. I would recommend that if you have young kids, you bring them to this kids club and let them enjoy it. Everyone that works at this hotel was wonderful. I have never been to a place where the staff makes you feel as welcome as they did. They were all so sweet to my daughter. I wish I could give everyone by name. I would also like to add that NO ONE ever approached us regarding Time Share Sales. It was a great vacation and I would recommend this to couples or families that are not into a Cancun party scene. This hotel is a class act. It truly was a special treat to stay at this hotel.", "Date": "March 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newmarket", "Title": "\u201cGreat and getting better every day!\u201d", "Author": "mgangels", "ReviewID": "UR26749937", "Content": "Just returned from a family holiday and we had a wonderful exerpience. There were 17 of us in total ranging in age from 72 to 18months. Everyone had a great time! The resort is smaller and we appreciated that after a number of years of family resorts that are massive sites where you can spend forever walking from one place to another and forget trying to find each other. At Hacienda its big enough to not feel crowded and small enough to find each other. There was lots to do as well during the day, walks on the beach, snorkling, kayaking, swimming, walking the trails in the nature park. The cenotes are beautiful for swimmng and kayaking! The morning walks with Silvia (from the activities department) were great! The rooms are beautiful and spacious and the cleaning staff are warm and friendly and willing to help out in any way. We used room service a couple of times and it took about 1/2hour but the food was delicious and hot! The staff in the restaurants need a little more experience but they make up for it with friendlyness and willingness to please. The food was good and if they didn't have what you wanted just ask they are so happy to take care of you. Oscar the head chef is so proud of his team and that kind of leadership and positive attitude filters down! It is well located between Cancun and Playa del Carmen so getting around was easy. I think what I liked best wasthe staff, they are so friendly and warm and eager to please. Franco from the activities staff was also a lot of fun! There needs to be a little more to do in the evening. There were a couple of shows, and Karaoke, casino night etc. But they are building a theatre and are planning on having more entertainment.

The quality of staff they've hired is a good start, but a lot of work has to be done to bring the entire experience up to the level they've set for themselves. For the price they charge, the quality is not yet there. Finally, despite charging a fairly high price, and billing itself as a top-of-the-line resort, I found that there were a nickel-and-dime approach was taken with many amenities, such as charging extra for certain types of wine (as in merlot vs. cabernet -- not even high-cost brands), for matches (even after you purchased a $25 cigar), etc. These small things must be changed for this resort to move into the class it thinks it's already in.

In spite of this I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. The staff is wonderful and the chef Oscar is world class. I recently returned from my latest trip and was very pleased to see much progress being made. Yes, the resort is in start-up mode, yes, there are many things that need to be fixed, but being in the engineering/construction industry I understand that you can't be at 100% completion before you need to start generating some cash flow.

The hotel is gorgeous, the rooms are huge and pristine, the beds very comfortable and the staff is the best I've ever encountered. I've travelled my whole life and we were blown away by how friendly, helpful, and genuine the staff are at this hotel. And every night when we came back to our pristine rooms, they were sparkling clean, the beds turned down, candy on our pillows, and some gorgeous \"towel animals\" decorating the bed. They actually teach guests how to make these creations! The highlight was the food. I lived in New York City for five years and ate at every good restaurant I could find, and this place is right up there with some of the five star restaurants I've eaten at in NYC. There is lots of variety, lots of very gourmet menu choices, and all beautifully presented. The food looks and tastes like art. Omar, the chef, is amazing. The Mariachi band and fire show at dinner were both wonderful. They plan to offer and welcome equestrian show in the future, which sounds amazing. The activities were fun: especially the cenote swim and kayaking down the river. Fun yoga and pilates classes as well. The beach is nice, with gorgeous king size beds to lay out on. but the water is much cleaner further down by Playa del Carmen. This is a result of the hurricane and will hopefully improve with time. The pools are beautiful, huge, but a bit cold. Who cares, when it's 85 degrees and sunny! I do think they could make it easier to do some of the activities without a guide. For example, I'd have liked to go cenote swimming or kayaking on my own after the initial tour. But they offered all kinds of fun activities and evening entertainment. If you get involved, you'll have a blast. As for complaints about the time share sales people: what do you expect when you agree to go on a timeshare tour? Of course they're going to try to sell it to you. Honestly, they don't need to try very hard. This place sells itself.

Some of them very fair and honest, others seemed to be a rant from people who ought to not travel anywhere out of country. I wish to be fair in my opinions and my intent is to only offer thoughts that will be productive for this great new resort. My husband I are frequent vacationers in the Playa area. We started visting many years ago and fell in love with the culture and the people. We have visited many resorts and found Tres Rios to be beautiful and the quiet holiday we needed. THE RESORT-still a work in progress, like any new business, it just takes time to make it all run well. THE ROOMS- really really nice, clean, very comfy beds and linens ( I am a linen snob and never thought once about my own sheets!) no room was to far from anything. There are DVD players in each room, so bring your own if you want. You can borrow from their list too. ROOM SERVICE-This is my biggest negative! The room service did not offer the same level of quality that eating out at the restaurants did. If Tres Rios want to attain the level of recogniton that they want then they have to \"fix\" the room service issues. Room service at an all-inclusive 5* HOTEL should be without a problem. We were told that our meals would be \"up\" in 30 mintues and many times took nearly and hour. Our orders were not as we ordered many times. Meals were never hot but warm or near cold. The staff did not seem to understand what condiments to bring for what meal....Salt, ketchup, butter, etc.... The resort needs to invest in those warming carts that many hotels have. The food would arrive warm as if it came straight from the kitchen. Room service is to be a treat for vacationers..unless you have a maid at home. THE POOLS- cold, never got in once...I thought they were to be heated???? THE BEACH- very nice, very quiet , water still brown with seaweed. You will have to go to PLAYA del Carmen to get your \"blue water fix\"..I have total confidence that the resort will take care of this in time...after all, a CAT 5 hurricane devestated the enviornment only a few years back. THE STAFF-gracious, kind and never without a smile..the resort needs to put more staff out at the pools so that guest do not have to serve themselves. The staff did everything they could to keep up with the guest demands. It is NOT the job of the poolside staff to get you a tissue...please treat them with respect. THE FOOD-Great and Adventerous..Oscar the chef? should have his own show! My only complaint is that the food on the buffet was never warm enough to really enjoy. I know that they were working on this and trying to adjust the temp of the warming tables. While I did not travel with my kids, I do undertand the food issues with the kids choices. The resort ought to consider putting in a kids station with kid-friendly food so that they can serve themselves. The parent's would love this. MY FAVE- the fennel cream soup and the guacamole from the grill ( not on the menu, ask, all homemade as you wait!) MY LEAST FAVE- the crickets THE BEST- I asked Oscar how I could get my hands on some chocolate strawberries because I always missed them being out out. After dinner that evening, we found a bottle of wine and a plate of strawberries in our room. VERY NICE! Would suggest to the resort- need to have more \"snacks\" out during the day. Maybe some small snacks in the rooms daily, fruit, chips, etc..Need some sweet snacks by the pool. Maybe cut up fruit and cookies? Ice cream? THE DRINKS~ needs a little more work...my husband gave bartending lessons to a few of the waitstaff. The WINE~ the resort needs a broader wine selection. I travel with some of the biggest wine snobs on the planet and they would have paid anything for more choices to go with the meals we had. THE SPA- I did the $12 massage with OSCAR...he's is great. I also did the hot stone along with the added jacuzzi afterwards...the \"real\" spa is not opened yet, but it was still great! TIME SHARE- we are owners at SUNSET FISHERMAN, all I can say is, get it ALL in writing and realize that it is a high pressure environment and you can always come back another day to buy and get the same deal! THE TOURS- loved the Kayaking..to short! THE \"ENTERTAINMENT\" STAFF- this crew is awesome. They were so fun, so nice and really had fun with each other and their job. KIDS CLUB- we did not have kids in the club but I still wanted to assure anyone coming to Tres Rios with thier kids, the staff was wonderful. I was very impressed by the way the girls \"loved\" on the kids and watched them. NEGATIVES-loud obnoxious guest that yelled across the pool to other guests as if we all wanted to hear about their life story. For heavens sake, get up an walk over to someone. SIGNAGE- THE RESORT needs to out up more signs from the main entrance to the lobby. Our driver got lost and we just kept driving until we saw lights. OVERALL- had a wonderful time and will be back! This resort has the potential to be the best around. It is unpretentious and blends in with its surroundings. The colors are simple and unassuming. It is a larger resort but is not obnoxious and does not scream \"tacky resort.\" This place is very classy and tasteful.", "Date": "March 2, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hacienda Tres Rios", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150812-d1022792-Reviews-Hacienda_Tres_Rios-Playa_del_Carmen_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "Price": "$204 - $513*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Carretera Cancun-Tulum, Km. 54</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Playa del Carmen</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">77760</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Mexico</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1022792", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/ae/93/5e/the-place-where-luxury.jpg"}}
