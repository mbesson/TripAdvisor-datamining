We initally booked to stay in a hotel just outside of the city but decided to swap our hotels and selected this one as the location was a little more central and on the website the rooms looked quite pleasant. Imagine our surprise when on check-in we were shown to a door opposite the hotel with an iron grate across it, leading us up to a tiny room with two single camp beds and a shared bathroom! We immediately went back downstairs to speak to management as we'd booked and paid for a double en suite and figured there must have been a mistake. On seeing us the man on reception walked away and hid behind a staff door! After being ignored for some time we decided to go for dinner in the hope that when we returned somebody else would be on shift. Eventually at about 10pm we were spoken to - IN FLUENT ENGLISH!! - by another member of staff who changed his tone as soon as he realised we were complaining and pretended he did not understand, we then put our best efforts into describing the situation in Italian and after some time he understood that we wouldn't be giving up until we were properly acknowledged. We were offered 20Euros as a refund but no choice to upgrade as there were 'no other rooms available' This was the hotel from hell, pervy italian locals would sit on the landing accross from the shared (ergh) bathroom every morning wearing next to nothing. Bugs, unwashed sheets, a huge broken fan (possibly the air conditioning advertised?!) taking up half the space in the tiny room and squeaky old camp beds. I am fully aware of the difference between 5* luxury and budget accommodation, considering the price we paid (\u00c2\u00a3450 for 3 nights) I was not expecting butler service but a little cleanliness and a room that matches the 'professional' photographs would have been nice.

The reviews all were pretty good compared to other ones in our budget. BUT...lets just say...if you are looking for a hotel to stay in, if you stay here, you mid as well save the extra money and just stay in a hostel. The hotel staff are rude. We ordered a double room through orbitz.com. When we finally found the hotel, which was difficult because the staff never emailed me back with directions after repeated attempts, they said they didnt have our reservation. I had the confirmation number and gave them the sheet I printed from Orbitz. They made some phone calls and found us a room. They put us in a room the size of a shoe box, and was not a double. We complained and they answered us telling us that since they didnt have our reservation, (because one of their staff made a mistake) that they had to put us there, but not to worry, it was an upgrade from their two star Annex hotel to this 3 star room. Which was a lie. If this was 3 stars, I would hate to see what the 2 stars looked like. When I went to take a shower, their was a bug and an \"unknown hair\" in the bath tub...as as we went to bed, we found another bug dead in the sheets. We tore off the comforter and slept with a blanket we brought with us. The next morning we went down to complain again thinking a new employee would hear our complaints. She, who we think was the owner, described what they gave us, or upgraded us to, in her words....as \"A Gift.\" She said, \"look at it like a gift, we upgraded u from 2 stars to 3. A gift.\" lol. I about fell over. And i suppose the pubic hair and bug was the wrapping paper and bow on our gift huh? PS...theres no elevator, and no internet. We asked about wifi, and were told...\"Yes we have a wireless connection, but it is for staff only and is blocked...there are computers over there with internet.\" Yea, at 1 euro for 15 minutes, we passed up that GREAT OPPORTUNITY. Overall...i do not suggest this hotel. For what they charge, you will get the same thing paying half the price in a hostel. If you want something nice, stay away from here. AWFUL HOTEL! And the 3 stars should be taken away, because to any standards Ive ever known, it doesnt even deserve 1 star.

Since I was traveling with a small group of friends, I got to see 6 rooms beside my own. My single room and bathroom each had open-able 8 foot tall windows and shutters with a great, quiet view over a small campo with trees and shrubs. It also had a terrazzo floor and spacious (by Venetian stds) bathroom. My friends' rooms didn't have much in the way of windows and their bathrooms were tiny and didn't have windows. The twin beds in each room are Euro-style which are narrower than our American twin beds. Everything in Venice smells at least a little damp and this hotel was no different. Not unpleasant to me but some of my friends complained. We stayed for4 nights. Enough about room set ups! This hotel is on Rio Marin, a small canal, & about 10-15 mins easy walk away from Ferrovia train station. (If you go to Venice, travel light because you have to schlep everything over several or many sets of bridges each with a set of stairs going up and going down.) This hotel is about 10 mins easy walk to Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari church (aka Frari Church) with its glorious Titian and Bellini paintings, and Donatello sculpture. Some of us attended Easter services at Frari and were blown away by the gloriousness of this church's art, altars, monuments, etc. Breakfast each morning was not very interesting but satisfying - hardboiled eggs, white cheese chunks, yogurts, toasts, croissants, 2 cold cereals, 2 juices, a big jar of Nutella, 3 bowls of jam, coffee/tea/cappucino. No fruit or veg that I recall. There are 2 internet stations in the lobby at about 1 Euro for 15 mins. However, whenever I tried to pay they wouldn't take my money - probably because I was only on for a few minutes each time. A couple of warnings - there is no elevator in this multi-storied hotel. Also, there is a high step just to the left of the reception desk.

On Finding the hotel - had we not been distracted by our hunger and ended up on the other side of Venice the Hotel would have been very easy to find, infact when we started to look fo it we found it very easily! the Hotel is less than 10 minutes from the bus station where Ryanair passangers are likely to have been dropped of by the coach and about 5 minutes from the train station just over the bridge. This was brilliant as obviously the lack of taxi's means you have to find your own way unless you get on the water taxi as soon as you get there. On the area - The hotel is in a nice quiet area given how close it is to the grand canal, which was nice as we felt safe staying there and walking to and from the hotel. The canal that runs by the front of the hotel is lovely and favourite with the Gondala's so makes a lovely spot to sit by and take pictures. Obviously Venice's narrow streets are a bit strange at first to those who are not used to them and some of the surrounding \"streets\" are abit narrow but this is somehting that you will experience all round the island. On the Hotel itself - The hotel was fine, all hotels that we looked at in venice were either the same price or more expensive. The reception is open 24 hours and you leave your key when you go out. Our room was a little disappointing as it did resemble a corridor being so long and thin but we soon got used to it and were comfortable enough. I will say however the walls are very very thin and we could hear our neighbours which at times was very unpleasent and late at night very frustrating. Breakfast was standard european buffett style although you should get there early otherwise you might not get much to eat.

We were given a free upgrade to the 3* area of the hotel as I e-mailed the hotel prior to arrival and gave some bull ---- about getting engaged...if you don't ask you don't get! The hotel is in a quiet area of Venice although the locals do gather around a bar just next door which can be a bit noisy, if hot and you have the windows open.The rooms are nice and comfortable and the breakfast fills you up. If you're prepared to walk around Venice rather than just do the touristy thing, this hotel is a great base. We spent 3 hours walking to St Mark's square through quaint side streets...there's a shop on each corner and suddenly you find yourself in a small square with other attractions. If you want the 'slap bang in the middle of everything hotel' this isn't for you. If you are prepared to wander and walk and see what you come across...this is brilliant. I work in the travel industry and am quite picky but I read the reviews and thought let's go for it and I'm glad we did. This area is a lot cheaper for food and eating out than the South of Venice and anyone moaning about the cost obviously hasn't travelled to many European cities. A dinner out is no more than you would pay here... We paid \u00e2\u201a\u00ac50.00 for a 2 course meal including 1/2 litre of wine each.

A chandelier hung from the ceiling to create an element of splendor in an otherwise confined space. The hotel and the rooms were clean, as was the communal bathroom, shared by approximately five other bedrooms on the floor. The best thing about the Hotel Basilea was its location, just a short walk from the bus depot and train station. It was far away enough from the more bustling areas of Venice so that we could get a quiet night of rest. The price also couldn't be beat. We booked through Expedia and got a great deal, probably a third of the price of other hotels in Venice proper. The negatives: The walls are thin, and in our case, we happened to be staying next to a loud snorer. The beds are a bit hard, though this seems to be common in Italy.

I had arrived late at night with a backpack and had spent the last half hour before arriving at the hotel looking for it so was not pleased to hear this on arrival. I protested slightly and the elderly gentleman at reception offered to carry my backpack (!) to the other hotel which turned out to be the Basilea. What a blessing in disguise the broken plumbingl turned out to be! The Basilea is situated a five minute easy walk from both the train station and bus station. It is situated on a quiet and most delightful little canal. I was completely smitten by it when on my 2nd night I saw a gondola and young gondolier going by heading out towards the grand canal for customers with his small pet dog on board! Close to the hotel is a tiny but funky little bar that appears to attract loyal local customers. It was a perfect place to sit, unwind and watch the odd gondola go by as you cradle a glass of Spritz. There is a great little bakery close by for a nice mid-morning shot of good caffeine. Again, it is a place that appears to be frequented more by locals than tourists. The hotel itself I found to be charming. The rooms are decked out in lovely Venetian decor complete with gold guilding etc. on furnishings and lovely matching bedspreads and chandeliers. My room was towards the side of the canal and like a previous reviewer mentioned, you had to stick your head out of the window to see it but I would rather this as the canals can sometimes get a little noisy with the passing morning traffic. Nevertheless, I had no problems with noise. Windows appear to be double glazed and excess heat was no problem as rooms are air-conditioned. My bathroom on both occasions was of a good size with a full sized (double, I think) shower with excellent water pressure and beautiful thick and fluffy white towels. Rooms were cleaned to a very high standard daily. Breakfast was standard buffet with cold meats, pastries and a \"cooked\" option which consisted of scrambled eggs. There was also a type of breakfast cereal plus yoghurt and canned fruits etc. Admittedly, coffee was not fab but you could get your fix just 10 metres away (see above). Staff were super friendly. My Venice map is scribbled with their directions and suggestions for a nice bar, a small little trattoria, the best way to get to the Basilica, etc. etc. I was greeted very warmly daily and my every need during my stay was met more than adequately. This is a charming and quiet hotel superbly situated close to transport and major attractions staffed with warm, attentive and importantly knowledgeable local staff.

Here are my two cents to try and make things a little easier: 1. Firstly, Venice is one of the most incrediably beautiful cities I have ever visited. Waking up with the canals on your door step is a lovely experience (but compared to staying inland in say Mestre, is a luxury you pay for). 2. This hotel is a little tired but from research, the price is about average for a hotel of this standard. 3. The room size varies enormously in this hotel - we had a tiny room whilst others had much more substantial sized rooms. Our twin room did have a lovely garden view. 4. The service is not overtly friendly but not unhelpful regarding specific requests. 5. The \"hot\" breakfast consists of an omlette by request but is otherwise the same standard buffet. 6. The room was cleaned daily to a good standard. 7. The location is excellent - close to the bus and train station, in a quiet part of town but not too far from the Rialto/St Marco (20 min stroll). If I return to Venice, I would want to look into hiring an apartment for a week so I could self-cater and take advantage of the markets. For a weekend stay, I don't think Hotel Basilea is a bad choice - Venice is not a city where your hotel will make or break your experience.", "Date": "September 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cDon't Bother\u201d", "Author": "Traveler3434", "ReviewID": "UR8602003", "Content": "We had a bad experience at this hotel.
