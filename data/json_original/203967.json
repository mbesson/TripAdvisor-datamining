{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Definitely NOT 4 STAR having stayed in 2 other hotels in Italy prior to Hotel ritz, we were looking forward to our stay in Florence. Neither of us had been to Florence and were excited at seeing the city.Before I start my feedback, be re-assured we were by no means expecting 'THE RITZ'.... we were expecting 4 star hotel.Where do I start, the hotel on entry, I can assure you was NOT a 4STAR accomodation, it is in major state of dis-repair.(holes in walls, in numerous places, the carpets were well worn- need I go on)One good side, the reception staff were friendly enough.If you do have a car it's 25 euro extra per day for parking in a garage at the back of the hotel.The room- well one good thing for it- the linen/towels were changed daily, which was nice.The room itself smelled of stale smoke, with the dust under the bed only knows when the last time it had a good clean. And dont even ask to try to see yourself with the dirt on the mirror in the wardrobe.However the beds were comfortable- just dont expect to have a romantic few days in Florence as we requested a double bed but got twin beds(normally the head boards are attached- not these) what a romance killer!Lastly but by no means least- the bathroom or 'wet room'. It was definitely wet after having a shower, you could nearly swim to the door with the amount of water in the room flowing out into the hallway. We could not close the door to the bathroom so obviously this wasn't a new problem to the room.Did we complain?No we had paid in advance so there was no point in swapping hotels. We thought also if this is what the rooms are like, what if the next room is worse... and it wouldn't have changed our opinion.Breakfast- it is included, we were hoping this would redeem the hotel, sadly it did not. We went to breakfast about 9.00/9.30 each morning, the coffee had been sitting there since first thing- ie it was cold. If you like cocoa pops and plain oul ham and hard rolls, then you would be happy.Overall, I am sorry to say we were not impressed and it actually put a whole damper on the Florence romantic time we had planned.I would like to re-visit Florence, but sorry definitely not in Hotel Ritz, this is our opinion, some others may differ, but as the saying goes 'buyer beware'", "Date": "Sep 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR524089781", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "shedo"}, {"Content": "Professional staff, nice view, location-good Our room overlooked the river and we opened the window and had a great view.

The floor which was tiled was dirty in the corners, there was a thick layer of dust on everything, the brass bed ends, the chandelier, the TV, inside the wardrobes, so thick in places it was like felt.The TV was 3 metres above the floor? Why? It was absolutely filthy. I was able to stand on a chair and write the words clean me across it in the dust it was so bad. (photo to follow!)before we could sleep in the bed we had to take a damp towel and wipe down the metal surfaces of the bed to remove the dust and no doub't bed mites which love that kind of filth.The navy blue bed cover was obviously not laundered very often as it had some white stains on the underside of it near the top. I'll leave you to draw your own conclusions!! After the first night we rolled it up in to a heap with the stains showing so that the cleaner might think to replace it. We were much too the optimist, it was neatly placed back onto the bed for that night in the same condition as before!There was no other accommodation available otherwise we would have walked out. The saving grace was that the sheets on the bed were clean and the bath towels looked okay.The dining room was amazing, not because it was fantastic, but because it was so bad, the large round tables were squashed in with little room between them, the table cloths were generally stained. Instead of removing them after previous diners they were hoovered with a miniature table top hoover and left for the next diner, regardless of whether they were stained or not.The choice at breakfast was poor and not what we had anticipated.What I would like to know is, who awards them their stars, surely the bottom entry should be a high standard of cleanliness and a commitment to customer care and satisfaction. Sorely lacking here. In fact they should be ashamed of themselves and remove any star from their advertising so as not to mislead people.", "Date": "Apr 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR561781011", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "AlnwickWanderer"}, {"Content": "overpriced and shabby we have just returned from a 2 night stay in this hotel. We had a family suite - it wasn't large but was adequate. However it was very expensive for what it was. The rooms were shabby and not very well lit. Wallpaper was peeling from the walls and part of the door frame was missing on the bathroom door. Our window overlooked a back street but there was no problem with noise. Sheets and towels were clean. Breakfast however was very poor - just rolls, a few buns and cereal. We were very late having breakfast the first morning and were horrified to see the kitchen lady just put the large bowls of cereal in a cupboard without being covered up! Needless to say we didn't eat cereal the next morning and my teenage son refused to eat any breakfast at all. The location was OK but the Ritz has 4 stars above its doors - a real joke. This is a 2-3 star hotel at most. We had expected a lot more as it was nearly 400 Euros for the 2 nights.

They almost ruined my trip! I read the reviews of the Hotel Ritz on TripAdvisor and was mortified! I knew I had no say so on the hotel choice since I was invited to go on this trip. I had read about dirty sheets and towels and since I am a clean freak and very particular about the sheets I decided to bring my own! I lugged a set of twin sheets and 1 bath towel and 1 hand towel all the way from MS to Italy just in case!! Well, I didn't even use them! We stayed here on March 4-9,2007 The room we had was #25 on the second floor and it was quite large. Therewas an entry foyer and a decent size bathroom with one sink and a tubwith a shower. The bedroom was large with 2 twin beds pushed together. There was an armoire, 2 nightstands, a desk and chair and a small fridge. There was plenty of light from the floor lamp, desk lamp and 2 bedside lamps. The sheets were CLEAN and even appeared new. The bedspreads looked new also. The towels were CLEAN and fairlythick. Our sheets and towels were changed everyday and the room cleaned and trash taken out. We didn't see any bugs. There was plentyof hot water for a long shower. The hair dryer was old and looked like a vacuum cleaner! It had heat but poor blowing power and it tookme 15 minutes to dry my long hair! My own travel dryer hardlyworked at all even with an adapter. We had a large window that overlooked the side street. The view from the window was the Arno River to the left and the spire of St. Croce to the right. Across thestreet was a lovely home with a flower strewn patio. Perfect!! We opened the window whenever we were in the room to let in cool air.Would not stay here in the heat of summer because I feel the AC wouldnot be good enough. Or maybe it was not turned on since it was still cool out. There is a pully cord behind the curtains that lowersa metal shade down over the outside of the window to help with sound and light.The street noise was loud but I was prepared and used ear plugs every night. My roommate slept fine without earplugs as did my aunt and uncle who were in room # 33. Their room was on the 3rd floor right on the front overlooking the Arno. It was a huge room with entry foyer, large bathroom with double sinks and plenty of counter space, glass enclosed tub with shower, and a large corner room with a window on front and another on the side street. It even had a king bed! So remember to request either room 33 or 25!! I did not care if the decor of the lobby was dated and the rooms plain---I came to see the beauty of Florence!! The breakfast wasn't fancy but was enough to help you get the day started. The staff was friendly and recomended several resteraunts and even a good place to get gelato. They even parked and fetched our rental car when we needed it. The location of the Hotel Ritz was great! St.Croce is but a few blocks away and the Ponte Vecchio and Uffizzi are a straight walk down the main street. I would stay here again. I would recomend it. I regret letting all the negative reviews on this sight almost ruin my trip! Some people just like to complain about everything. Our hotels in the US spoil us. This is Europe and things are different.

The reason that they gave us for giving us this room was that we wanted a view of the Arno (our agent requested it because of our honeymoon).
