{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Disappointing This hostel advertises itself as 'stylish' and '5-star', with breakfast included. I saw no breakfast nor was it ever mentioned to me, the private room was bare except for the bed; the room didn't even have a curtain in the window, which was fronting the street and the windows of the opposite building. In the evenings it felt like being in a shop window. Nights were noisy. The only good thing I can say is that the guy who signed me in was reasonably friendly. I was very disappointed, as the reviews I'd read beforehand had seemed reasonable, or I'd never chosen this place.", "Date": "Mar 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR981318639", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "mea1"}, {"Content": "the wort experience so far... the only positive thing i can say about this hostel is its location which is near the mrt. When we stayed for 10 days last month we witnessed the owner freddy being abusive to his wife and towards other guests including ourselves. on our last evening freddy was as usual drinking heavily n told us at 10oclock to turn the kitchen light off. we did but told him we were not happy about the way we had been treated - he started shouting at us and woke our neighbour in our room. he became v aggressive n told us that he would make sure that something happened to us when we reached thailand - we spent the night frightened for our safety. the next day at the airport we made a complaint to the tourism board.
