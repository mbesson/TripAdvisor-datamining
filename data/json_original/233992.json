Free wifi available but only in the foyer for 30 mins blocks. Breakfast not included in the tariff I paid, but had quite a wide choice of food available. Restaurant downstairs.

We specifically booked this hotel as it had free parking that would accept a large van and an on site resturant and bar as we knew that we would arrive late and would not want to go in search of food. The hotel is clean, tidy and has a great breakfast buffet, but when we arrived at 10pm, the restraunt and bar were both shut, the reason given was that there were too few guests to warrent opening them. this forced us to dump everything and head into town in search of food, which at 10:30pm on a Sunday night was thin on the ground. We eventually persueded a curry house to open a little later for us, stuffed our faces and went to bed. This lack of food and drink spoilt the hotel as otherwise, it was perfect.

The hotel is clean and renoveted like most of the NH hotels. Although the trip was private on the second day I had to print couple of work relayted documents. They had a room with internet, printer, etc. I paid extra of course, but everything was quick and efficient. The breakfast was simple, nothing special but the quality was good. The only problem was the distance to the city center. On that day S-bahn staff was on strike, we had to take a bus to get to the center, which took a while.

This hotel is lovely, definetily deserves its four stars. The room was spacious and clean, having all that was necessary and even some extras for a pleasant stay. However they had feather pillows which were not so good for myself and my friend as we are allergic. On asking for alternative pillows we received two more feather pillows. This was probably due to our lack of German, however this was uncomfortable and annoying. The suburb of Treptow is pleasent, about five minutes walk from the hotel is a shopping mall with many shops and a supermarket (and a MacDonalds). Next to this is the train station, which has frequent trains into the city centre or back to Schoefeld airport. Overall, our stay at NH Treptow was pleasant and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a small, clean and quiet hotel to stay in.", "Date": "December 15, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "NH Berlin-Treptow", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d233992-Reviews-NH_Berlin_Treptow-Berlin.html", "Price": "$64 - $169*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Spreestrasse 14</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">12439</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "233992", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/ec/34/ec346b6d30568460b50416710fb3c5bd6large.jpg"}}
