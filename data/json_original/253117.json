Throughout the three-day stay there was an cleaning gear cupboard open in the foyer. The bedroom was cramped, superficially clean but dirty in the detail - for example, the radiator grilles and the net curtains. There was no drawer space provided at all, just one 2 1/2 foot by 1 foot alcove with half a dozen coat hangers on a rail for both of us and our luggage. Decor was 1970's chic. There was one pillow on each side of the bed with one spare pillow in the top of the aforementioned alcove. There was no waste bin in the bedroom, just a very small one in the bathroom. Street noise was excessive, even with the window closed. As there was no air conditioning, leaving the window closed was not a preferred option. There was a fan provided but it turned out to be non-operational. On taking it down to reception the young lad merely gave a rather expert gallic shrug and I returned to the room empty-handed. The bathroom had a shower cubicle with a (torn) shower curtain that was too large so that showering involved the experience of being embraced by a clammy mass of nylon. The hot tap on the sink was almost completely seized and I got plenty of exercise wrestling with it until there was enough water forthcoming to wash my hands. The sink plug did not lift properly so that water took a long while to drain away. Hand towels were not provided, but the management seemed to have attempted to address this shortcoming by providing bath towels that were almost as small as hand towels. On the last day, no towels were provided at all and it took the manager considerable effort to drag himself away from the football match on the television in order to go off and find some for me. The breakfast was the piece de resistance, in the local parlance. There were no plates provided - just sheets of paper on which were tastefully dumped a portion of jam - cheap label, a portion of cheese spread - cheap label, a portion of butter and two sugar lumps. Breakfast, when delivered, was a croissant each and a piece of french stick. The coffee was warm, not hot. The one good thing was that the orange juice appeared to be freshly squeezed.

Sink and toilet water tank cover were cracked (see photos) - still clean though and no leaks. 2. If you are tall (above 1.70 meters), and you get the street facing right corner room, you might need to sit on your knees to shower \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I know I did. Why you ask?

Breakfast \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we discovered that what we thought to be a joke, is actually the common thing in other hotels and restaurants - small orange juice glass, coffee or tea, small butter, small jab, small cheese, quarter baget and croision per person. No plate. Knife and teaspoon. My wife used to order the tea and as it came on a napkin and plate, she put the cup aside and used the plate as plate.

There are a couple of tube stations around so all in all has good links around the city.", "Date": "July 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "North America", "Title": "\u201cThree Ladies from Canada\u201d", "Author": "Franceine", "ReviewID": "UR7569990", "Content": "We just returned from a 3 week trip to France. We stayed at this hotel on two occasions. The first was when we arrived from Canada. We were given a room on the 5th floor and it was on the street side. It was quite noisy, but late in the evening, the street quietened down. The room was clean, the mattresses were so comfortable, and the room itself was bright, yet cramped for 3 ladies. The breakfasts in the bright and clean cellar dining area were wonderful: baguettes, croissants, butter, creme cheese, jams and coffee, tea or hot chocolate were a great start to every day. We stayed there for 3 nights and moved on to another city after making reservations with the desk clerk, who wrote our request in the book and who understood that we wanted 3 more nights in two weeks time. We left on further adventures assuming the reservations had been made. We returned on the last end of our trip and after a 5 hour high speed train trip, we arrived to find there were no reservations for us. We were extremely upset. However, the manager of the hotel (an Algerian chap) arranged to get us into another hotel a few streets away. It was not an ideal situation, however, we were picked up by him personally!!!! the next day and moved into our \"old room\" on the 5th floor. Here we stayed for 2 more nights and had a wonderful end to our vacation. The majority of the staff of the hotel do not speak English well, however if you make the effort, they will also try to understand. The manager is wonderful and the cleaning staff do their best to keep a very busy hotel clean. The area is the red light district and the blvd de Clichy is indeed an area that is eye opening in the daytime, but surprisingly, it is safe in the night time as long as you dont linger, or get eye contact with any of the \"men\".....we were 3 ladies at times and we never had any problems, and never encountered any pick pockets, etc. We were very aware of where our purses were.", "Date": "May 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "glasgow", "Title": "\u201cCheap but cheerful\u201d", "Author": "julesmayb", "ReviewID": "UR7214455", "Content": "I was a bit unsure what to expect here 'cos of widely differing reviews but I must say I was pleasantly surprised.

I'm sure that if you stood alone on a street corner wearing stilettoes and a short skirt you would eventually be propositioned, but we had no hassle whatsoever. The hotel was basic but clean and comfortable. Remarkably good-quality toilet paper!! Staff weren't the most enthusiastic but spoke good English. Breakfast was basic but plenty of it. Good tea! My one complaint would be lack of storage space in the room. As long as you don't mind living out your suitcase you'd be fine. There was a corner to hang up coats but that was about it. All-in-all I'd definitely go back and stay if I plan another low-budget trip to Paris.", "Date": "March 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Eire", "Title": "\u201c\"smelly\" visitor from Ireland\u201d", "Author": "brav0", "ReviewID": "UR6811423", "Content": "We have just returned from Paris. Originally we were booked into this hotel when we booked our trip in Jan. We arrived to the hotel to be told the had no room available for us so we had to go to the hotel next door and return to st.George the next morning.we understood these things happen.finally getting sorted we were so excited and decided to go for a walk.to our surprise we were slap bang in the middle of the red light area (moulin rouge was a 3 min walk) it was soooo sleazy and dirty my image of a romantic weekend in Paris soon faded. We were terrified to go into a bar or restaurant as there were men outside THESE clubs trying to get you in, so we just went back to the hotel and went to bed. The next morning we packed up and went back to saint George where they still had no room ready. We left our bags at reception and headed off sightseeing as enough time had been wasted. On our return we went to our room which was small smelly and only a lamp worked.We turned back went to reception and checked out and went and got another hotel.Between the Horrible Hotel and the Sleazy area I would advise anyone to STAY AWAY.(unless you're into that!)

We were after a cheap, clean hotel as near to the centre of Paris as we could afford. We booked as part of a package with Eurostar. Upon arrival we collected our keys and we had two twin rooms. The beds were so close together they looked like a double, but were in fact two beds. The sheets were changed daily and we had clean towels in the bathroom for us to use. The room was small, but had everything we needed. the bathroom was small too, but served it's purpose and it was nice to have an en-suite. The road on which the hotel is on is just around the corner from the sex shops and bright lights on Pigalle, but the street is pretty quiet. it was close to the Metro and only a short walk from Gard de Nord. We found it really easy to get about, and the hotel staff were friendly and gave us weather reports each morning! Most of them spoke English, and with our bad French we managed to communicate OK. Breakfast was basic, some bread and croissant and tea/coffee and orange juice, but was OK. it was included in our package price and filled us up until lunchtime. I would recommend this hotel if you are after somewhere cheap, but clean and easy to travel from. I would have liked to stay in one of the posh hotels in Paris, but I was very pleased with the service we were given in this hotel, given the price we paid for it.", "Date": "September 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cComfortable, pleasant hotel\u201d", "Author": "mrsspikes", "ReviewID": "UR5533742", "Content": "We stayed for three nights. Reception staff were friendly and able to speak English when our french faltered. It was no problem to leave luggage with them either. Everything in the hotel was compact, small bedroom and ensuite, small breakfast room and 2 person sized lift but room was comfortable (good firm mattress) with a large opening window and a fan, shower etc was fine and breakfast was served efficiently. The lift broke down on the second day and was quickly mended. Our room was at the front of the hotel and despite being on 4th floor it was pretty noisy late into the night and early in the morning. We did have the double glazed windows fully open though and I should think they soundproof well when shut. The location is great, near lots of restaurants and amenities to the East and South, plenty to explore. Metro very close and well linked to main tourist sites. Paris centre and Sacre Coeur etc walkable if you wish. Very handy for Gare du Nord as short metro ride or 15min walk with luggage. Basically, you get what you pay for - at around 95 Euros a night including breakfast, in a good spot, it's bound to be on the lower end of luxury but a good base and perfectly adequate.", "Date": "July 31, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel St. Georges Lafayette", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d253117-Reviews-Hotel_St_Georges_Lafayette-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$107 - $171*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">11 Rue Victor Masse</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75009</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "253117", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/f6/f4/f6f45da06a469391af57eef5a71d6ae64large.jpg"}}
