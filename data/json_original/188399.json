First, the central reservation line for Travelodge made a mistake and booked me one smoking and one non-smoking room instead of two non-smoking rooms. I caught this while confirming the reservation and was told that I had booked a non-changeable rate and should talk to the hotel to have the booking modified. I promptly called up the hotel and fixed the issue (or so I thought). They asked me to pay extra to have the reservation switched which I agreed to. The day I showed up I was told that only one of the rooms I had booked was ready and the other one was going to be cleaned soon. I confirmed that both rooms wer non-smoking and asked them to take their time and get the cleaning right. I then checked into the first room (which was non-smoking). Getting the second room took three phone calls to the front desk and about 90 minutes. The rest of my family checked into the second room outside of which there was NO non-smoking sign. I figured that didn't mean anything but the next morning we found out that the bathroom in the \"smoking\" room smelled of cigarette smoke. I was told , very rudely, by the front desk staff that they wouldn't be arguing the point with me when I pointed out that I was given a smoking room when I clearly booked a non-smoking one. How could I tell for sure that it was a smoking room? Because it did not have a non-smoking sign and the bathroom was filled with the smell of smoke. All this despite me waiting patiently for about an hour and a half while the room could be cleaned before check in. Tardiness I can tolerate, lying on the other hand is unacceptable. Will never stay at this place again. I'd advise you to do the same unless you can abide by their lies. There's a place called Grouse Inn next door which looked nicer. I'll probably try that out the next time I visit. I did stay at another Travelodge in Victoria and the experience was excellent. Something I've come to expect from Travelodge hotels.

As far as I can tell, the renovations included new carpet, bedding, paint, and some furniture and fixtures. The room looks just like the pics on the site, smells just fine and is clean. The bathroom is small and in need of some help, but it's as good as possible for an old bath, clean and functional. Yeah, the furniture is dinged up a little, some of the stuff in the bathroom is discolored or loose, and the walls are kind of thin (we had partying neighbors in the adjoining room who either had a pet skunk or were smoking a good amount of pot...the sounds and smells did get through the wall and locked door), but it's pretty much a standard, clean, freshened-up 2-star hotel/motel room all around.

In conclusion, the Lions Gate Travelodge isn't perfect, but it'll likely give you a great bang for your buck if the north side of the Lionsgate Bridge works for you, you understand there is definitely an older property under the recent remodel and you don't need tons of amenities and extras.

It was so run down and disgusting. We ended up checking out the other hotels in the area and told them about why we had booked at the travelodge and they all said that the reviews are LIES. That they actually go on and write good reviews for themselves. DO NOT GO THERE. TRUST ME IT IS SO GROSS. The shower in our bathroom looked like a shower from a public swimming pool. DON'T GO IN WITHOUT FLIP FLOPS. Ya, that is how NASTY this place is. YUCK! YUCK! YUCK!

I booked the room on line (paying only $49CDN per night for the four of us) and was sent a response right away. I didn't expect much being a two star motel but I was most pleasantly surprised. Our room was nicely decorated with co-ordinating neutral tones, fluffy duvet style comforters, excellent comfy pillows. The motel is set amongst many others in the area but is the only one in that grouping that is not on a main road so it was quiet. The only down side was there was no bath which we did know in advance so I was prepared. It is an older style building but the bathroom was the only room that made that obvious. Our last stay was at a Best Western near Seatac before a flight to Mexico and I was kept up all night by the partiers in the room above, so I was very happy to have the top floor and noise from the neighbours on both sides was non-existant. Also the kids loved it. There was a water tower and small fridge which are great to have with kids and being a motel it is easy access to the car parked directly outside the door for all the stuff that you have to carry. It was a very handy location for access to downtown Vancouver, Stanley Park etc. There is a Denny's on one side (which gives you 20% off if you are staying at the motel) and an inexpensive Vietnamese noodle house on the other. I had read the reviews before I booked and most were positive and ours was too.

The first night there were four of us staying in two separate rooms, the second night three of us stayed in one room with two beds. Despite mixed reviews we booked the hotel for the location (a short drive to the Horseshoe Bay ferry, and short walk to the Lion's Gate bridge) and the price, which was 65 CAD per night for the rooms with one bed, 95 for the room with two. The motel appears to have been updated recently, because all of the rooms were quite nice with modern decorations, good beds with nice quilts. The room size varied from large to very large. The outside of the motel looks like an average roadside motel, and there are no elevators (only two floors) which can be a pain if you have a lot of luggage. As others have pointed out, this is not a hotel, so be aware of that when you book. However, as motels go we thought this was a very good place to stay. The entrance is a bit hard to find but if you're coming from the west (from the Lion's Gate bridge, Horseshoe Bay or Hwy 99) the hotel has a large billboard sign tell you which turns to make. Coming from the east we found it a bit harder to locate. It's right next to a Denny's. Be warned, however, that if you book online at the Travelodge website, the motel might not receive your reservation. The online website lists some rooms with queen beds, which the motel does not have (only kings and doubles). If you book one of these rooms, the motel might not receive the booking! We had booked two such rooms and they didn't have a record of either. However, the staff were extremely helpful and apologetic (apparently this has happened before) and manage to find rooms for us both nights. Probably it would be better to book rooms directly with the motel instead of through Travelodge. They were also very accomodating to our request to change one reservation for five people to four people, and another for four people to three people (even though it required changing rooms). Additionally they provided us with directions and information about everything we wanted to see/do in Vancouver. The location is about a 20-minute walk to Stanley Park across the Lion's Gate Bridge (which offers fantastic views of city, sea and mountains, particularly in the evening). If you don't want to walk though be warned that traffic congestion around the bridge can be pretty bad at certain times of the day.", "Date": "July 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201csurprised!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3687938", "Content": "We were very nervous, but we were soo surprised.
