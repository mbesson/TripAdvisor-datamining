Having stayed at many more full-service Marriott properties and Residence Inns than Courtyard Marriotts, this was suprisingly clean and the rooms were good-sized for San Francisco. I thought the bathroom had a unique layout with the sink being right on top of the toilet - but this is not typically people's main concerns. The free wi-fi is a nice touch. The staff is extremely friendly - as I was welcomed back every single time I walked in the door and by several people. This is probablly one of the friendliest front of the house staff that I have encountered. The front desk, however, did not seem to be particularly knowledgable when posed questions regarding where to dine and were not engaged in giving recommendations, either. They could have been more \"Marriott\" helpful there. Ask for a room away from the alleyway - if possible - it's quite loud with the Subway and other businessess that house their storefronts there. If you are looking for a place to have breakfast in the morning - I highly recommend The Hollywood Cafe - which is a couple of blocks away. Overall - for what you pay - this is a good value in a very convenient (to the Pier, tourist stuff on the Wharf etc.) area.

It's close to all the major attractions or within a trolley car ride away. Fishermans Wharf, Pier 39, Boudin's and Ghirardelli's are within walking distance. Both starting points for the Cable Cars and the Street Cars are just a short walk from the hotel. The cable cars will take you past Lombard Street (Crookedest Street), the Cable Car Museum, China Town and down into the shopping district. The view from the cable cars are amazing especially if you hang off the side! The street cars, on the histroric F-line, will take you past Pier 39, Alcatraz Landing on Pier 33 and all the way into the centre for shopping and beyond. We took the street car to the Civic Centre on 8th and then bus 21 to Alamo Park to see the Painted Ladies. The cable cars are $6 per ride and the street cars are $2 per ride but if you buy a 1, 3, or 7 day pass it will cover you for unlimited rides on not only the trolley cars but also the buses. The day pass is $14 and the 3 day pass is $21 per person. It was great value as we used it not only for the sights but also for going to Whole Foods etc. Getting to the Golden Gate Bridge was trickier without a car. We were told that bus 30 (one street up from the hotel) and then bus 28 would take you to the viewing point at the foot of the bridge. We waited until we picked up our rental on the last day and drove down Lomard street, onto the 101 and just before you cross the bridge there is a turn off for the viewing point. Keep right or you will miss the very tight turn off. Or just keep going straight ahead and cross the bridge to the other viewing point which has views of the city too. We didn't cross over so I have no directions. The Hotel itself was good. Check in was speedy. The staff very knowledgable and helpful.

I felt very safe in this neighborhood and didn't worry about walking around at night, or letting my boys have a little freedom looking at the shops. Plus, there is an \"In and Out Burger\" in the same complex which made for happy teenagers! There are really nice, free computers to use in the lobby so my boys could stay connected on Facebook easily. There is a cool \"touchboard\" , kind of like a huge ipad, in the lobby which was very fun to use. The staff was friendly and professional and the concierges very helpful and knowledgeable. The breakfast place provided good, healthy food for a reasonable price which helped us make the early morning tours. The rooms are generic Courtyard rooms but I felt they were a little bigger than most which we appreciated with 4 of us in the room. The rooms were clean and the amenities just what we needed. I could not have asked for anything more. The public transporatation system for SF is excellent: easy to use, clean, timely and safe. We bought the $20 3 day Muni pass which allows for unlimited use of the electric busses and cable cars. It worked out to be a great deal, not just for the $, but just knowing we could hop on a bus along the wharf to get back to our hotel easily. We took the Extranomical City Tour with Alcatraz and the Muir Woods/Sausalito Tour. Both were great and well worth our time. I liked Extranomical because they picked us up at our hotel right on time, we travelled in small but roomy vans with 10 people total and the tour guides were very responsive to any requests we had. Just a word of warning-if you travel in August and want to go to Alcatraz (and who doesn't?) get your tour tickets AT LEAST 10 days in advance. There are limited visitors allowed on the island and many people were very disappointed to see the tour sold out for 10 days solid. I liked both tours and thought they provided that \"taste of\" the city/Muir Woods/Sausalito that we were looking for. Both of my teenagers thought they were just the right length of time to hold their attention but not be boring. My husband and son took in a Giants game at AT&T park and thought it was wonderful. It's a bit of walk even using the \"F\" line but the weather was cool and the excitement was high so they didn't mind at all. Vacationing with teenagers can be tricky, but this trip to SF was just perfect. We were busy and enjoyed experiencing a city together. We stayed 3 1/2 days and felt that was just right. I would have enjoyed a little more shopping but with 3 men, it was probably better to leave than listen to them whine about going into yet another shop. :)", "Date": "August 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201clocation in fisherman' s wharf\u201d", "Author": "carriglio", "ReviewID": "UR74428121", "Content": "centrallylocated (only one block from ghirardelli square) ; reasonably priced compared with other hotels in SFO (200 US$ per night) Spacious rooms, good service.

We chose the Courtyard because the rates were reasonable ($119) and they allowed up to 4 people in the room. Many other hotels in SF restrict it to 2 people and/or make you pay extra, so that is a benefit. The hotel itself is located in a very convenient location in the Fishermans Wharf area on Beach Street, just a street up from the main street, Jefferson, where all the action is. It's a basic hotel room, but clean and well appointed. The staff could not have been more friendly and nicer. You really can't go wrong. As far as getting there, we realized there isn't an easy way to reach Fishermans Wharf from either airport (Oakland or SFO), unless you don't mind dragging your luggage from BART to streetcar (and streetcars don't always run on schedule as we unfortunately learned on a rainy, cold day). We elected to take a taxi from SFO ($45), which with 4 people really made sense anyway, as it would have cost us nearly the same to buy BART and streetcar fares. The hotel breakfast option was probably the only aspect that wasn't great. Maybe it was just circumstance, but when we went down for breakfast one morning, there was a long line and the staff had difficulty keeping up with the orders. You order at the counter and some of the food was given immediately and some was delivered to the table about 10 minutes later...we enjoyed breakfast at two eateries which are located diagonally across the street on Columbus Street, Pergamino Coffee & Tea (really cute and quaint place with HUGE pancakes) and Happy Days Diner (good standard fare). The Boudin Bakery is also a nice option for lunch or light dinner. It's affordable and during the day you can watch them make bread which they shape into crabs and other sealife. Most restaurants in Fishermans Wharf are terribly overpriced and the menus all seem similar. Try McCormick and Kuletos happy hour that starts at 3pm, it's really reasonable. A wonderful find for dinner was Bocce Cafe in the Italian district at 478 Green Street. It's a brisk 15 minute walk from the hotel up Columbus Street, and well worth it. The food is good and reasonably priced and the atmosphere is great, with live music. Excellent. We will definitely go back. If you get tired of walking and taking public transportation, another nice option is that Avis and Hertz are located in the same block of the hotel. We went online and rented a car for the day and drove to areas we couldn't access easily like the Golden Gate Park, as well as driving across the Golden Gate Bridge and into Marin County.

I don't think the problem was the room or the building, the bath faucet and sink had great pressure. I know low-flow showerheads are supposed to save water, but that is negated when you have to spend twice as long in the shower. The showerhead was one of those detachable deals - you could really see the lack of pressure when it was pointed straight up - there was not even enough pressure for water to spray upwards.

The street on which the hotel is located is safe and not as \u201ctouristy\u201d as the Wharf, so you can easily avoid it if you see fit.

My original reservation was for 2 nights but I found myself needing to check in a night early, unexpectedly. The front desk manager was VERY helpful with this. I called in the afternoon on the date I needed to check in and although the hotel was close to being sold out he not only let me check in one night early, but he honored the low rate which I had for the rest of my reservation. This was awesome service!! The front desk agent at check-in was very courteous. There was one problem, though. I had lost my credit card so I not only had to pay for my room but leave a cash deposit. My deposit was not returned to me upon check-out but I had to wait to get it by mail. This was very dissapointing, as I know it is not the policy followed by the majority of hotels. Now, back to my stay... My room was decorated in a very modern, tasteful manner. Lately, I have noticed that a lot of Courtyard brand hotels are being redecorated in a manner that gives them a very modern feel which makes you feel as if you are staying in something better than your run of the mill budget brand. High Speed Internet (wired) was free which was awesome!! (I had to call the front desk in order to find out that it was free as their is no signage in the room specifying this.)

The rear of the hotel leads out to the street directly across from Fisherman's Wharf. I've stayed in most San Francisco neighborhoods, at some point or another, and I really think that it doesn't really matter where you stay, as to me, San Francisco is way smaller than it actually looks. The rear of the hotel leads out to a shopping area that includes a Hooters, In and Out Burger,and just around the corner is a Wallgreens (to pick up any toiletry you might have forgotten.)

If you decide to eat breakfast on the 2nd floor, be sure to look over the prices for the buffet and contential breakfast carefully that is in the room guide book. I did not check the prices first and the buffet was expensive. Breakfast staff was great and cook great, food fine...just was a lot more expensive that I was expecting. Again, I recommend this hotel.", "Date": "July 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cMarriott Rewards Mmbrs: Confirm your reservation!!!\u201d", "Author": "lambertbunch", "ReviewID": "UR18237881", "Content": "If you plan to stay at this hotel, I would highly recommend that you call ahead to confirm you reservation.

Since my last stay there have been a few improvements. The bath products are now \"Davies Gate\" brand, and are quite nice. There were 5 pillows on the bed to choose from. And the courtyard seems a bit more alive, but there are still some empty \"for lease\" storefronts. Front desk staff seems genuinely friendly and personable, not just \"put on.\" This time I stayed two nights, and I did notice the early morning dumpster noise coming from Beach Street (in front of the hotel), although it didn't bother me too much--I had the heater on, so the fan sound acted as a buffer. Double pane windows would greatly help with the noise issue. The windows are in need of replacement anyway, they are the one thing showing age in the room. Otherwise the room was clean, simple, tasteful, and in very good condition. Maid service did a great job of refreshing the room for my second night. I came by ferry and without a car this time, and it was easy to catch busses to everywhere I needed to go. I recommend walking over to see the fishing boats on the pier near Scoma's restaurant--it's a quiet escape, and a different world in comparison to the noisy din of the tourist area.

Based on previous reviews and the pictures I had seen I knew not to get my hopes up too much. I have to say the location COULD NOT be beat!!!! We were just a few blocks away in either direction from Fisherman's Wharf, Pier 39, the Cannery, and Ghiradelli Square (and a cable car stop). Just a few blocks up the road was the North Beach area of town though we didn't get to wander around this area as much as we would have liked. The check-in was quick and easy and we were given a room on the 2nd floor- which I believe was close to the breakfast area based on the morning noise and clanking dishes. One thing I was very pleased with was the cleanliness of the room and that housekeeping left us additional towels the next day. We had a very of the parking garage next door which wasn't a big deal since we weren't in the room very often. The bed was comfortable and the internet access was quick. The lobby had coffee available each morning which I really enjoyed for the convenience, though there is a Starbucks around the corner about a block up the road. If you plan on renting a car at any time Avis and Hertz are located next door in the parking garage which was extremely convenient as we took a day trip to Sonoma. The two things I didn't care much for with this hotel was that it was a fairly old hotel that could use some updating and the walls seem to be paper thin. I could hear everything at all times of the day from the neighbors next door to the clanking dishes in the restaurant and also the people and traffic outside.

We chose this hotel for its location and price. Pros: The room was clean and nicely furnished. The location is amazing - right on Fisherman's Wharf, with many conviences right nearby: Walgreen's, Starbucks, the trolleys, many restaurants. The concierge at the hotel is really nice and very helpful arranging a bus tour for us. The breafast great and the hostess was very pleasant. The bathrooms were clean and nice, with a large tub and nice toiletries. Cons: The views from many of the rooms will not be great. Our room's view was a blue parking garage about 10 feet away from the window. But, since we did not spend much time in the room, it was fine with us. Parking costs $22 a day, so if you are not going anywhere but San Fran, I recommend not renting a car since it costs so much to park. Hertz rent-a-car is right next door to the hotel in that blue garage, so if you change your mind you could alwyas get a car right there. Other recommendations: The motorized cable car tour offered by Gray Line Tours was fanstastic - I highly recommend it. Also, I recommend eating at Scoma's - great seafood. Skip the cable car at the west end of the wharf - you will wait in line forever and then be packed in it like a sardine - you can take the trolley that starts right in front of Walgreen's for way cheaper and it takes you to the same end point at the fancy cable car.

I had even called the hotel at 5 PM and told them of my anticipated late arrival. They knew I was coming with kids as I asked if there were any rollaways still available. On the second day of our stay they contacted me and said they did have our room available and there was a rollaway already in the room. They also provided buffet breakfast for the remainder of the 3 days. They stated that upper management overbooks the hotel in order to guarantee they will be full. This still does not make sense to me because if I don't show up, the room is still charged to my credit card. The hotel itself is reasonably clean. Rooms were standard Courtyard rooms.
