Good low price and accomodations. The hostel is basic as there is a small looby and kitchen. The rooms are basic bunk beds and a general shower area which could have been cleaner if givien proper attention by the staff. The nice thing for me was in the room were folks from France, Sweden, Columbia all which were happy go lucky and freindly. The rooms had lockers to hold a small suitcase but do bring your own lock. The location is a good one near Central Park and really quite quiet neighborhood. I wouldn't hesitate to go back there for a short stay in the future. Absolutely good room rates and friendly staff", "Date": "July 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leamington Spa, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cVery good for the price and location\u201d", "Author": "Poppy_Mccrale", "ReviewID": "UR114768263", "Content": "It was a very good trip, we stayed in the 10 bed ensuite. It had air conditioning which was really good for how warm it is in the evening in new york in the summer. The room was clean and tidy and had plenty of room with lockers. The breakfast was good toast and coffee which is a perfect way to start the day, though it strictly goes away at 10 so make sure you get in before then. The staff were friendly and helpful. However when we arrived we had a seperate booking because of availability, they refused to swap our friend even though there was space in our room. It was a case of computer says no. Also they made us check out and check in again despite the fact we were in the same room and beds, which seemed riduclously sticking to the rules. The location was perfect on the upper east side with subway just a block away. Also the restaurant next door the barking dog does really nice food.", "Date": "June 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portsmouth,", "Title": "\u201cGood place to stay\u201d", "Author": "craig_runt", "ReviewID": "UR91575302", "Content": "The room was warm, bright, smelt of cleaning products (without being overpowering!!), staff were friendly around the clock and was nearby to the subway station.

My friend and I (both in our early 30's and from Missouri) stayed here 1 night and we slept fully clothed as we were afraid to even touch anything. Yes, we are from the Midwest where everything is usually clean, nice, and reasonably-priced, but this was truly beyond what we could have even imagined as \"slumming it\" at a hostel in NYC. Trust me, we aren't \"snooty\" suburbanites who were mad that it wasn't like the Ritz. This was really really bad. After paying for an \"upgrade\" to a private room, we still barely slept a wink. Every corner of the place had dirt. The bed and linens were nasty. The TV in room didn't work other a blue-screen. The bathroom was full of mold and filth. The air-conditioner in the window had no caulking, so all the draft came in and we froze. You get 1 sheet and no towels. No blankets. For $100, you'll get a dirty bed and a door to close. That's it really. I would never, ever stay here again unless I was 18 years old and planned to go out and get so sloppy drunk that I didn't care what pile of garbage I put my head on. Avoid. I would, however, recommend The American Dream hostel on 24th. Its very clean and reasonable as hostels go.", "Date": "October 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Bend, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cnyc hostel\u201d", "Author": "jammmo", "ReviewID": "UR73202078", "Content": "nice, clean, free breakfast, nice people, reasonable price, nice neighborhood, three blocks to subway", "Date": "August 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow", "Title": "\u201cFun and cheap - what more can you ask for?\u201d", "Author": "tehblonde", "ReviewID": "UR67817888", "Content": "I stayed in Tone on Lex over christmas 2008. The hostel is by no means a luxurious place to stay but I'm pretty sure people looking for luxury don't choose to stay in hostels. This place was a great base for exploring New York, just around the corner from the subway and a fairly short walk from the Metropolitan Museum, Guggenheim and Central Park. We arrived late at night (about 11pm) and before we had even walked through the door we had received an amazingly friendly welcome from some of the staff and other guests, and were invited to go out with them. We had an amazing night out and because the staff knew New York really well we felt really safe. The hostel was a really friendly and fun place to stay, and was really cheap too. We had a room on the ground floor and even though the heating was too high at night time the room was fine. The toilet and shower were small but adequate. The staff were really knowledgeable about the city and gave us advice about the best things to see/do. Breakfast was pretty good - oatmeal/cereal, toast and juice/coffee - and set us up for the day.

The outside looks gorgeous and really inkeeping with the area but the inside decor was tasteless, the bathrooms were not clean and it was freezing. Considering the day temperatures were about -11 you can imagine what it would be like at night and with a huge sash window that had an inch gap in it and the smallest heater in the room I have ever seen (the radiator had been removed - why?!) needless to say we did not look forward to going to bed. When we asked for and extra blankets (as they only provided two thin fleece ones) they said they had run out. The staff were helpful and found us a larger heater but it did not help. As we only booked in late we had no choice but to stay. We ended up sleeping in our clothes with a dirty duvet tacked over the window to stop the cold air coming in.

A subway ride to midtown takes about 10-15 mins and to downtown 20-25. It's easy to get to Central Park which is about 5-10 mins away, just walk 3 blocks west and you will get there. I came here on a solo trip and it was my first time ever staying at a hostel so I didnt really know what to expect. But to my suprise it was a good hostel and even though check in time doesen't start until 3 pm the staff were very helpful and I was allowed to check in at 2 pm when I arrived. It's a cheap and good hostel. The room: I stayed in a 10 bed dorm mixed with both men and women and it was clean all right, the rooms are have ac so and that was good now in the summer heat of 2009. You get a locker in the room where you can put your personal belongings and fit some clothes, but bring your own lock and key. Most of the rooms don't have their own showers and restrooms but there is one or two on each of the floors. I suggest that if you want to take a shower go to the second floor shower room, that's the best shower. Restrooms ok but some don't have a mirror but the shower rooms have. They serve free breakfast every morning from 9 am and it's usually food there by 10 am if you wanna go up later but to be sure be there between 9-9:30. The food was ok, bagels, fruit, waffles and lemonade so it was ok. One bad thing with the hostel is that there's not really a hang out area but the kitchen and the small garden is where people drink the beer and the vodka and just hang out. Be sure to check out the pubcrawl and the phucked-up fridays when the staff takes you out to party with people from the hostel and this is a great opportunity to get to know some of the people your staying with and it was fun. If you want to check out one of the bars before the pubcrawl go to The Big Easy on 3rd ave and E 92nd st which is a great divebar where you can drink beer and play beerpong with your friends, try it!", "Date": "July 27, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Tone on Lex", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d1201662-Reviews-Tone_on_Lex-New_York_City_New_York.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">179 East 94th</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New York City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NY</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">10128</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1201662", "ImgURL": ""}}
