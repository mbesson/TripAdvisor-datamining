We booked a room with a view of the lagoon for ourselves, and a room with a view of rooftops for our sons. They didn't have much of a view but were more interested in the TV anyway. Both rooms and bathrooms were in tip-top condition, beautifully furnished, and the lady who cleaned them every day and prepared them for the night was brilliant. She really added to the pleasure of the stay. The hotel is in a fantastic location right on a wide promenade called the Riva degli Schiavoni and we delighted in the spectacle of Venice below our bedroom window on the second floor -- street artists, groups of students singing, stalls and gondolas, and the occasional huge cruise-ship gliding by. It is just a hop from San Marco piazza, really convenient. As everyone has said, it is also right near the vaporetto and water taxi stops. It was worthwhile for our family of four to take the water-taxi from the airport, a tremendous experience. The rest of the time we used vaporettos, which added to the special feeling of being in Venice. We booked the Tchaikovsky package which included a dinner in their restaurant, and the service was superb -- the maitre d' and his two waiters made us feel very well looked after and cosseted. We had cocktails in the bar before dinner, and I would highly recommend drinks at the bar as they are top-notch. They make their bellinis properly, from fresh ripe white peaches, so not available in the spring. I was recommended a rossini instead, made from fresh strawberry puree and topped with fizz, and it was utterly delicious. My husband's dry martini made him close his eyes with pleasure. All in all, a great stay in an extremely well-run hotel. You didn't notice the effort they were making, which is what a very good hotel is all about. The bald concierge with the funky glasses was particularly helpful.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cCharming Hotel.

It was lovely, a respite in a very touristy city, with large, gracious rooms. The roof deck was gorgeous. I am about to make another reservation, and I feel compelled to tell a story about a previous stay, after flying from New York specifically to get to Easter Mass at St. Mark's. For the first time in my life, I arrived in Venice by air and not by car, and we decided to splurge on a water taxi. The hotel is on the Grand Canal, and we expected an uneventful and straightforward arrival. After I paid and got out of the taxi, a very brusque, large German man pushed past my wife and shoved her into a brand new piling sticking up from the water at the dock. There was a 6 inch splinter on that piling that pierced my wife's Achilles tendon and effectively crucified her to the piling. She was in agony, screaming loudly. I ran into the Londra Palace, gave them my name, explained what happened and asked them to get an ambulance right away. I said that in light of this incident, we might not be able to stay. They were very solicitous and efficient, the ambulance (a water taxi with a litter and medical crew, naturally) came and took my wife, but not me, to the hospital. By the time I got there, she was already in the operating room and fifteen minutes later they wheeled her out. The hospital refused payment and gave us two prescription scrips, an antibiotic and a painkiller, which she had to fill elsewhere because they had no dispensary. It was the afternoon of Holy Saturday, and this would prove to be no small task. Their instructions to her were to take the medication, to never get into a boat for the rest of the time we were in Venice but instead to walk everywhere, and if the pain got too intense, to have a martini. We found a pharmacy near the Rialto Bridge just before it closed, and despite this trauma, we had a lovely time walking all over the city, eating in the fine restaurant at the hotel and elsewhere and being doted on by the staff. We never got to Easter Mass. When we got home, my wife went to the Hospital for Special Surgery in NYC to see if everything had been done properly, and her orthopedic surgeon was stunned. \"If that had happened here, we would have had you on physical therapy for six months. It's perfect and you're walking just fine. Have a martini.\" So everything worked out thanks to the front desk of the Londra Palace.

We entered Venice by water taxi and were dropped off directly in front of the hotel on the busy waterfront promenade. As we walked into the lobby, the contrast between the touristy din outside and the peaceful atmosphere inside was striking. The atmosphere within the Londra Palace was completely peaceful, well-organized and accommodating...not to mention STUNNING!! The first impression is one of pure comfort and refinement. Warm, Venetian plaster walls, subtle mosaic floors, and exquisitely crafted Murano glass chandeliers greet your eyes as you enter the pale hotel lobby. The surrounding furniture is mid-century modern, upholstered in cream leather and accompanied by mid-tone wood tables, each table accented by a single clipped orchid. We were immediately greeted by a gracious, well-trained concierge who then personally escorted us to our room on the 4th floor. The room was of Neo-classical styling, spacious and offered an amazing view of the Grand Canal and the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore. However, perhaps one of the best parts of the hotel is their amazing Breakfast Buffet (included in the price of your room). Every morning you start with breakfast on the first floor patio.

Upon arrival the staff took control of me and assisted with our luggage which immediatly made us feel special and much needed as I was stressed from the jouney and almost 6 months of over work. Throughout our stay everything was perfect in every way. The rooms are trully beautiful, clean, light and airy. We had a logoon view with a balcony which was so worth the extra. The bed and the linen gave me probably the best nights sleep in 6 months. In fact I want one of those beds. The bathroom was beautiful and the shower amazing. The staff were unbelievable. Knowledgable, couteous and polite and certainly not what I expected at this end of the luxury spectrum, to be honest I did not know what to expect. Nothing was too much trouble for them with me or any of the other guests. They were simply there when you needed them and seemed to almost anticipate when you needed them and then melted back into the background which is probably the most difficult thing to get a good balance of. This includes the staff looking after our room. The bar area, breakfast/restaurant and lobby were bright, clean and very relaxing. Really felt relaxed straight away and enjoyed our stay at this hotel enormously. I have personally stayed in many many hotels in the UK and across Europe, admittedly not 4 star but service should be good no matter where you are. Here it was outstanding. As a base to see the most beautiful city in the world I simply cannot praise this hotel highly enough. They made us feel special and that is priceless. A personal message to Alain Bullo, I really do not understand some of the more negative reports. Everything was perfect in every way. Thank your staff for me and keep up the excellent work, your hotel certainly deserves the accollades it has. I will return but next time I think I will take a suite and relly live the high life.

Of the four Jr Suites, we got the one that per the website would have been my last choice...however, I was wrong. On the website it looks dark, and maybe it is, but what I liked was that we had a front view of the canal, a side view of the canal and a back view of the old town. Also, at first we thought the hot tub in the middle of the room was odd, but after long days of walking...and getting lost everyday, I can't tell you how much we needed to unwind in that tub. We used it all four nights we were there. Not sure if this matters, but it is definitely an older clientelle, and we are not that young, but we felt we were one of the youngest couples there. Also, I had this romantic vision of sitting outside having breakfast and watching the canal, but in actuality, you are watching hoards and hoards of tour groups coming from the ships and buses. Every one of them walks by the hotel while you are having breakfast. You just can't imagine how many people are entering this small space. What was amazing was their small, roof top deck. No one was up there, a hidden gem. The pictures we took from up there were some of our best in Venice. We went two nights in a row for sunset. We also enjoyed coming back for afternoon tea. We missed tea our first day by 10 mins...and they absolutely were strict about the time, no tea for us. We had a variety of service experience, and at a place like this, it should be consistently good, but our good experience was really great. He did a big favor for us one day, and recommended such an amazing restaurant off the beaten path, along a very private canal (can't remember the name). The location is perfect for getting to all the key places or for catching a water boat. Splurge and take a water taxi from the train station. We took a water bus, and it must have taken an hour, we took the water taxi back...worth saving on time and it was such a fun experience.

We would not consider this hotel a 5 star hotel (don't let the 1st floor mislead you)! The internet connection was down throughout our stay. When I walked downstairs each evening to inform the front desk, I was told that the server would be looked at in the morning and each day when we got back to our room in the evening, the internet never worked. Night after night, for 4 nights, I would be told that the internet is fine in the lobby, and for each night of my stay, I spent hours in the lobby versus the room that I paid for. Also, the hotel staff made us feel like we were bothering them when we asked them questions about anything (such as restaurant recommendations, activities or the internet connection) so that made each night returning to the hotel miserable because we never felt welcomed and very uncomfortable. The ONLY thing that we were \"graciously\" offered every morning was the trip to visit Murano. I felt very uncomfortable with that because it was the only thing we would be asked when we stopped by to the front desk (we only stopped by the front desk because we had to to drop off our room key). My husband and I felt like they were being too agressive about offering the trip to Murano daily because they did not care about how we were feeling about our stay or cared to address the issues about the internet connection that we expressed to them that we were very unhappy about.

We originally booked a top floor room with lagoon views, but I messed up the dates of our reservation. I called panicking, 2 days before we were hoping to arrive, but the very gracious Fabiana quickly found us another room. (This was in November, so not during the most popular time of year.) I was a little disappointed, when we were checking in, that the new room is on the 1st floor and right above the restaurant; but that concern quickly went a away when we saw the room. Our Junior Suite was lavishly decorated, spacious and had two huge windows facing the statue in front of the hotel, the boats and gondolas, the lagoon, and the islands across it. We even had a little balcony to take it all in. The masses of tourists marching to and from the nearby San Marco were also right there, along with the many trinket sellers, but to me they were part of the entertainment; and they quickly disappeared, if you just looked up a little bit. At night the embankment was fairly empty and quiet, so noise during sleeping hours was never an issue. The beds were very comfortable, with linen sheets, light comforters and abundant pillows. The love seat converted into a single bed, but we did not need it. There was plenty of room to stow away your things and the dining table could easily accommodate 4 people. The bathroom was also large and well stocked with thick towels, lovely products and robes. I loved the powerful rain shower (although the drainage was very slow, we had to remove the stopper in order to prevent the bath from filling up, while taking a shower.) The TV did not work very well, we had to have someone come up and fix the Sky connections and the remotes only worked directly in front of the TV, not from the bed or the sofa; but who comes to Venice to watch tv anyway?!? We just used to it to catch the news for a half hour before retiring every night. We absolutely loved the abundant breakfasts every morning and the very well prepared room service dinner we had the first night. I also enjoyed an early evening drink at the bar every day, by the third day the bartender asked \"The usual?\", which made me feel special and at home. The drinks were served with biscuits, canap\u00c3\u00a9s and really nice dark chocolate. All the staff we met was incredibly polite, helpful and friendly; from management to front desk, the servers, porters and maids. Everyone spoke lovely English. The vaporetto stop is directly across from the hotel, which made it easy to explore the city and to get back to the train station at the end of our stay. (We splurged for a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60 taxi from the train station to the hotel, but it's really not necessary, the vaporetto is a lot cheaper and only takes about 10 minutes longer.) This was my fourth visit to Venice and I really can't decide if I liked staying in the middle of it all or, as in previous visits, further away, in a locanda in a dark and romantic alley.

The marble bathroom was fine though the rain shower over the bath is not as nice as a proper one though pressure was adequate. The bed was great and very comfortable - we both slept well.

I'd already alerted the hotel to our tenth anniversary and they supplied a complimentary bottle of prosecco on ice which was a welcome sight after returning from a day in baking heat. We only ate in the hotel for the buffet breakfast which was included in our rate and was perfectly acceptable if not outstanding. All the staff were excellent and efficient with the only minor gripe being at checkout when after paying 800 euro's plus for two nights we didnt even get a thank you / goodbye or a 'did you enjoy your stay?'! perhaps our earlyish checkout caught the night staff at the end of his shift. On the whole I would highly recommend this hotel and think that it offers comparitive 'value' for such a central location - stay here and have a couple of drinks at the danieli in the evening and save a fortune!! With the money you save you can arrive in style on the 110 euro taxi rides each way from/to Marco Polo airport instead of the truly horrible Alilaguna line at 25 euro return where you feel like a trapped slave - believe me it seems expensive but it is soooo worth it.

I had spent a lot of time doing my research on location & getting a hotel with a good view of the canals, only to be very disappointed with Hotel Londra Palace. After checking in we were taking to our junior suite on the first floor, after looking around I asked the young lady are we in the right room as it looks nothing like what is shown on your website, she was hesitant and told me this is all the junior suite that are available. I said to her your website describes and shows a totally different room than what I am in, (see link below) she said she will talk to her manager. After waiting about 20 minutes I decided to go back down to reception to see what was going on, I was told by an older women (who I assume was the manger) it was a junior suite and this is all we have available. I had pointed out to her I have no view of the canal as there is scaffold in front of my window, she quite bluntly told me that is not her fault and that is all we have. I also said I believed a junior suite had two separate rooms with a bed in the separate room for my 70 year old mother to sleep in. From here on she become quite rude and wanted to argue with me about how they are on the fine hotels lists and how a fold out sofa is a bed and quite fine to sleep in, regardless of your age. In the end I could not be bothered and book an additional room for my mother as it was a bit hard all three of us sleeping in the same room with no privacy. The additional room I had paid for had air conditioning that did not cool, they said they would fix it but they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. We spent 2 days in Venice in 40deg heat and treated like lepers by these people just because we questioned them on the room, I could go on forever but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to bore you. Honestly have never seen anything like this in my travels around the world. I have stayed in plenty of hotels around the world and this is not a good hotel. The hallways are plain white and the place looks & feels like a hospital, the lift is a 2 person lift, we decided to walk up stairs as it was scary to ride in. It is just nothing like the reviews or their website. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want people to think I am fussy or being unreasonable, I have attached photos of the room along with their website link below, you be your own judge. I can assure you is this hotel is not 4 star & a long way from a fine hotel, \u00e2\u20ac\u01532 star at best\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and there is now way possible the hotel management have any hospitality training or management skills. For the money they are asking you can get much better in Venice than the Hotel Londra Palace. The pictures on their website of the junior suites is nothing like what we stayed in, I really doubt very much our room was a junior suite\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The breakfast was fair at best, nothing cooked, cereals, juice & fruit and you have to pay for a cappuccino. Please beware of the reviews as you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to read too many to get an idea on what is going on, look at the hotel link and my photos and be your own judge.

You also don't want to be in some obscure hotel which takes you 3 hours to find trudging up and down stairs and bridges with your luggage. You've probably heard some of the Venetian horror stories of trying to navigate around tight little streets badly marked and numbered. You just don't need that. Londra Palace is on the Grand Canal, visible from the water. Suggest you do as we did and get a Water Taxi transfer to and from the airport. Google online and you'll find a few options - we used Viator and it was great, all worked very well. Airport to the front of the hotel in 15mins. Londra Palance is perfectly located a very short stroll to St Mark's square and becomes your base camp as you explore those easy to reach and very cool sights close by; then as you get more used to Venice and using water buses etc, you venture further out but its always so easy to navigate back to St Marks square and Londra Palace is right there. We stayed in a Deluxe Room with Lagoon view and it was fantastic. Large, spacious, beautifully decked out. I loved everything about the room - the bathroom was especially nice which I always think is an important factor. The staff were professional and courteous the whole time. The manager at reception showed us up to the room and personally explained the amenities of the room, the hotel and workings of breakfast which was a nice touch. Breakfast was brilliantly served in the room and patio on the ground floor in front of the hotel looking towards the Grand Canal. The staff were all very pleasant, warm, welcoming, friendly and helpful. The front desk helped us with making some dinner reservations, pointing out a few must-see things including opening times and dates etc. and giving us a map.

The hotel is in a prime location with superb views of St Mark's Basin and San Giorgio Maggiore. And it is within 5 minutes of St. Mark's Square and one minute from a prime vaporetti stops. So it is also a very busy location with much pedestrian and boat traffic and concomitant noise, most of which is not objectionable but it can affect your sleeping if you have a room that faces that way and leave the window open at night. Closed, the windows keep things pretty quiet. The views are so exceptional that I believe the noise was worth it but everyone should make their own choice. The staff was excellent. Very helpful and friendly. Every member of the staff was charming. The rooms are done very luxuriously. Ours had 11 foot ceilings (the hotel is composed of three formerly private houses conjoined and has been run as a hotel since the 1880s). The beds are highest quality, from the mattresses to the coverings. The room was adequately sized, neither too large nor too small. I would note however that it is stated to be a junior suite and other rooms may be smaller. It was not what in the US we refer to as a suite in that there was only one room with a sitting area. In the US, \"\"suite\" generally means a sitting room and a sleeping room that are separate rooms with a door between them. The bathroom was also adequately sized. The shower pressure was strong, which was much appreciated although the drain was slow. There is a buffet breakfast included with the room that was quite ample. The hotel restaurant was quite excellent and I have reviewed that separately. Room service is available with a children's menu as well. I hope this is helpful.

The lobby is beautiful and tasteful and a good size, so that even if it's busy there is plenty of room for everyone. The staff at the front desk were incredibly helpful and polite. The one bellhop quickly carried our bags to our 2 rooms. He seemed to be the only one on staff and he worked incredibly hard. Overall the number of staff seemed sufficient. The maid service was fabulous -- every time we left the room they came in and did something - cleaned, brought more pillows, etc.. They knew when we were gone because each time we went out, we left the HUGE room key at the front desk. One note about the hotel entrance is that it is up 3-4 steps, with no visible option for those with disabilities. The same is true of the very small elevator, which does not look large enough to fit a wheelchair (there is standing room for 2 people comfortably, 3-4 in tight circumstances). The lack of accessibility is true of the city overall, so when counting this against the hotel, consider the overall situation in Venice. There are bridges over each of the canals that wind through the city and each requires the use of steps, with no ramps. The sidwalks throughout the city are old cobblestone and not well suited for wheels on a wheelchair or a walker. There is only one dining room in the hotel, but it was clean and roomy and the food was wonderful. We enjoyed our breakfast there each morning and the service was very good - attentive but not intrusive -- and they were very tolerant of my desire to practice my limited Italian skills. The breakfast is by buffet (a wondeful buffet with far more then fruit and cheese, which are the common choices on Italian breakfast buffets). And we were able to order eggs from the kitchen for a very reasonable price. The location of the hotel is wonderful. While it is a 15 minute vaporetto (bus) ride from the train station, it sits only minutes (and an easy walk) from St. Mark's square with other shops and restaurants near the square. It's also an easy 20 minute stroll from the hotel to the Rialto bridge, which is full of shops and restaurants. Something worth noting is that we often returned to our hotel late in the evening after strolling through the tiny streets of Venice after dinner. We were a group of women and felt very safe even late at night. The hotel room was nice overall. I stayed in a Jr. Suite and it was roomy and offered a fabulous view of the grand canal full of people and boats (Venice's \"Cars\") and vendors and tourists. The biggest difference from it and the larger suite is the balcony size. On the Jr. Suite the balcony is very small, standing room only. On the larger suite, the balcony was large enough for some chairs so you could sit and enjoy the view. The only downside to the room the bathroom. It was roomy enough by europen standards, but it was very musty and everytime the shower is used the bathroom floor floods with water because of the lack of a screen for the bath/shower. This is common in Europe and after enough time there, you learn to shower with care. :o) Overall I give this hotel a very good rating. The staff was helpful, able to offer recommendations and information as we needed it. There was a computer in the lobby for use by guests and a beautiful sitting area with free newspapers. The guest rooms are lovely and offer stunning views of the Grand Canal. We paid 360Euro per night for the junior suite, which was a special rate. I'd recommend you ask for any such rates when you book. It was well worth that amount and I would definitely recommend the hotel to anyone looking for a luxury experience while they explore the amazing city of Venice.", "Date": "October 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cTwo nights of romance\u201d", "Author": "SydneyOztraveller", "ReviewID": "UR18972392", "Content": "We have just had two magic days in Venice.

I wanted something special and personal - not one of the corporate like hotels with more conference room facilities than tourist facilities. My brother said that when he was in Venice he often stopped off at the Londra Palace for a cocktail as he walked along the promenade and vowed that he would stay there if he returned. So I booked it. We arrived by water taxi from the airport (an experience in it self and something one must do rather than take the public water bus). From the front, the hotel is not particularly impressive. Indeed, once inside, it is just simple chic, though clean, tidy and welcoming. Our room was on the 1st floor overlooking the lagoon (314). I guess the room (being a mini suite) was about 4 meters wide and 10 meters long, split into a bedroom area and a seating area with a cavernous bathroom and separate dressing area. A floor to ceiling window opened out onto a balcony that is not big enough to sit on but allows one to lean out and admire the view. Our friends (who came with us as one of them had lived and studied art in Venice and so knew her way around better than most tour guides) had a smaller room at the back (300) overlooking the city roof-tops, which was almost as perfect a view as ours. Breakfast at the hotel was had on the pavement veranda overlooking the promenade. Service was attentive. Breakfast was simple continental breads, fruit, cakes, meat and cheese but ample and more importantly fresh. We had dinner at the hotel on one occasion. The menu looks relatively expensive (as is everything in Venice) but when the bill was added up, it was only marginally more expensive than some of the less polished restaurants we went to. The food was excellent. The service was very professional - attentive but not intrusive. We felt special! The concierge was brilliant, advising us where to go, phoning restaurants to make bookings and having our keys ready when we returned without us having to say the room number. All the staff were pleasant and professional. The room rate is high but not as high as many of the other first class hotels. I understand that the rooms either face the lagoon or the city, not the brick wall of another building. If you pay for a junior suite, you get a view of the lagoon. If you pay for a standard room, you get a view of the city. No worries about whether you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get what you expect. The Londra Palace is a four star hotel, but I could not think of anything that a five star hotel would have to offer and that we needed. Everything was first class! Some reviews have commented on how noisy the rooms at the front are. They are right. The noise of the water busses is louder than lorries and is continuous. However, with the windows closed, it was quiet. With the windows open, it is the noise of Venice, which adds to the character. For us, the noise was of no concern at all.

As it was a special occassion and our first time away with no kids, we did a lot of research into which hotel we should stay at - looked at the top hotels (Cipriani, Il Bauer etc) and felt that the Londra Palace and inparticular ROOM 510 (which is the one with the LARGE TERRACE and lady sitting on it on their website) was the place to stay. In terms of location, I think it is arguably one of the best situated in Venice - just around the corner from the Grand Canal and a stones throw from San Marco. The Vaporetto stops right outside and also nice and quiet in the evenings. The dining room (we only had breakfast here) was very elegant and tastefully decorated, the staff were very friendly and helpful. Room 510 is the best there is - if you want to sit out on the large terrace (rare in Venice!) and see everything happening then this is the place. We nipped out to the local supermarket and brought our own bottle of wine back with some nibbles and thoroughly enjoyed sitting out there on a sunny afternoon. For an extra 10 euros per person, we also had breakfast served in our room. The room itself was spacious and the bathroom was fine. Towels were beautifully soft and everything was immaculately clean.

We were in room 208 in this building, which benefits from the balcony on the left of the 3, as you face the hotel. The room is fairly small, but certainly adequate for our purposes, and decorated in a manner best described as \"sumptuous\", comprising an antique bureau, fabric wall coverings and a high, frescoed ceiling. Aside from a small stain on the carpet, it was immaculate. Being on the waterfront, close to bus stops and St Mark's Square, there is a certain amount of round-the-clock noise that the double-glazing cannot completely eliminate. However, apart from the early morning honking of the ferry to Burano, we did not find the noise intrusive. The only negative was the rather crappy little TV, but with views this compelling, who needs telly? What really stood out for me about Londra Palace was that, in a city where employees of the service industries have raised unsmiling rudeness to an art form (when was the last time anyone saw a Venetian waiter crack a smile?), most of the staff were friendly and charming, and keen to do whatever they could to make our stay as pleasant as possible. The only real downside to this hotel is its restaurant. While the front of house do their best for you, they cannot make up for the lack of skill in the kitchen. We \"enjoyed\" mushily overcooked asparagus, followed by pasta so tooth-breakingly under-cooked as to redefine \"al dente\" altogether and then desserts from a 1970s-style sweet trolley that had been standing around the bar for goodness knows how long (perhaps since the 1970s).

I did a lot of research on Tripadvisor before making my decision. I figured the Londra was a good choice as it's not as hideously expensive as some of the others, but still of high class. I booked a 'suite with balcony' on the hotel's website thinking it would have a view of the Grand Canal and be on a high enough floor to not be too noisy. When arriving in Venice, we dropped off the rental car and took a water taxi to the hotel - a very lovely ride through the city to the front of the Hotel on the Grand Canal. We were checked-in quickly and courteously and taken to what turned out to be The Tchaikovsky suite on the first floor facing the Grand Canal. While this is a very lovely room, it is very noisy as you can much talk to anyone on the street from your window, and did not have a balcony. When I called the front desk to say I had booked a suite with a balcony, they said that I did not specifically state that I wanted a balcony in my reservation and had nothing available. They did offer to switch our room the second night, but we're not fond of packing up and moving again just for a night, so we stayed put. I have a theory that they made this room on the first floor the 'unique' Tchaikovsky suite as they figured no one would want to stay in it otherwise due to the noise. The room was decorated quite nicely and the small tribute to the composer was nice as I am a piano player myself. The bed was only slightly more comfortable than sleeping on wood and reminded me of a mattress that has been passed down a few generations. The marble bathroom was decent, but would flood every time you took a shower as there is only a small glass slab attached to the wall to keep any water in. Aside from the room, the front desk was helpful in giving us directions, booking our gondola ride (totally overrated and expensive at 110 Euro after dusk), and getting our water taxi to the airport. I also suggest not asking them for recommendations on where to eat, but rather walking the tiny streets and finding one on your own - but be aware that all restaurants will be sweeping their floors by 10pm. I also wouldn't recommend eating in the hotel restaurant. We had lunch there one day and was nothing more than average - you can find better places walking around. The hotel breakfast is also not much more than cereals and cheap pastries. We also found it difficult to get any attention from the wait staff the two times we sat out on the patio.

First off, I must say that the location of this hotel is fantastic and I would consider staying here again for that reason. However there were a few low points/ average experiences had whilst staying here. One experience was when we decided to have a drink at the bar one afternoon, after ordering drinks we requested an ashtray...three times...and it still was not provided. We then noticed that other patrons were provided with complimentary snacks with their drinks It was only after we placed our room key on the table when we started to get some reasonable service. One another day, I requested an iron of which I was informed that they did not have any irons! Although the hotel was reasonably clean the bathroom was very grotty, the back of the bathroom door was full of hair stuck with condensation from previous guests...yuk! Further, you can here toilets flush and showers running all timesof the day and night- very thin walls!! Staff in general are not very attentive, as you would expect for the price you are paying-in particular one time an employee at breakfast started to clean up our table before we had finished and grunted when we said that we were still eating. In summary, if you are staying here for the location you will not be disappointed...however if you are expecting any more you may be questioning if there is a better hotel to stay. One another note, for those who have not been to Venice before we recommend that you spend the extra money and get a water taxi to the hotel and not the water bus.

Firstly, the location cannot be beat. The hotel is situated along the famous Riva degli Schiavoni and practically directly across from the San Zaccaria vaporetto stop. The hotel is in good company, too; the Danieli is nearby (alas, not what I expected it to be and I was glad we opted for the Londra Palace). For a European hotel, in Italy, in Venice, the Londra Palace was airy and clean, with a cool color palate in the lobby. I booked through the hotel's web site and took advantage of the \"Welcome to Venice\" package -- which afforded us a double accommodation, overlooking a splendid piazza and old church (with bell tower lightly ringing each hour in the day). Our room was in Venetian decor-style, yet not too ornate and cluttered. Sheets were changed daily, as well as sweet-smelling towels. It provided us with small luxury hotel respite for five nights. The staff at the hotel couldn't have been nicer or more inviting. My mother and I especially enjoyed the staff at the hotel's restaurant Do Leoni, as well as the affable bartender. Venice is not a late night town and it seemed like at eight o'clock, San Marco and the Riva degli Schiavoni cleared for the day. This is when we took advantage of Do Leoni and the hotel's lounge. A lasting memory was sitting at a small table in the lounge with a dessert wine and sublime ice cream and candy creation while watching San Giorgio across the way. Breakfast was included with our package and it was displayed in a lovely manner each day. Albeit nothing incredible in terms of a spread, the service was kind and friendly. Note: The hotel next door, Hotel Savoia, to the hotel has a restaurant called Principessa. It's a great place to sit outside and enjoy the \"Cafe Society\" life, all the while sipping a delicious orange juice or a hot chocolate. But beware of going inside to the actual restaurant. I am not a complainer and hate when I see fellow Americans expect the world when dining, whether it be in Europe or in the United States. But really, it was just an awful dining experience and the service was so slow. On top of it all, the waiters were quite rude with no action to be rude over. My main concern when traveling is the safety of the hotel's location. You couldn't get any safer than the Londra Palace, even walking along the Riva in the late evening. Venice is gorgeous at night, haunting and mysterious in the morning hours; it was nice to not have to be worried about traveling back to our hotel through small, winding streets. Londra is out in the open, well lit and beckons your arrival after a long day exploring Venice. Two suggestions for Italy holidays: Go to the church of San Vidal to savor Vivaldi music in the evening (daily concerts). It added to the Venetian experience. Also, my mother and I also visted Rome on our trip. One day, we hired Giovanni Garguilo of Tour of Italy to take us to the Amalfi Coast--for the day! (Google him and you'll find his web site.)

There is nothing wrong with the hotel - our room, although a little small and unbearably hot at night (they don't turn on the AC until April!)was comfortable, clean, well appointed and well decorated, service was good and friendly, breakfast was good by continental standards (no hot food) and there is a reasonable, though small, bar - but the hotel lacked that little bit extra which turns a good hotel into a great one. Having been to the fabulous lobby bar at the Danieli on our one previous trip to Venice, we were determined to stay there on our next visit. However, negative reviews on Tripadvisor convinced us the Danieli was,sadly, yet another faded former Grande Dame trading on it's past reputation a'la New York's Plaza Hotel. We actually paid more for our 'Deluxe Lagoon View Room' at the Londra Palace than we would have done for a standard room at the Danieli. Staying in one of the best rooms at a so called lesser hotel is often a better choice than a standard room at the supposed best place in town. Having still not seen a room at the Danieli, they wouldn't show us one during the evening because 'the hotel is full' (even though it clearly wasn't), we don't know if we made the right decision or not. We believe standard rooms are at the sides of the Danieli and in the more modern buildings so they certainly won't have the great views offered from the Londra Palace's Lagoon View Rooms. In any case,the former's windows look so small you probably can't see much out of them and the rooms must be quite dark! Overall, we liked the Londra Palace but would choose somewhere with more to it next time - although the view and location were perfect. We would strongly consider the Metropole. We had one of our best meals ever at the Michelin-starred Met restaurant and it was only 160 Euros for a set five course menu for two with wine - a bargain in any city but especially Venice! The bar was also excellent and the hotel generally seemed more opulent, spacious and characterful.", "Date": "March 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, UK", "Title": "\u201cFriendly Staff, Excellent Service, Quality Rooms at The Londra Palace\u201d", "Author": "Manchester_UKMark", "ReviewID": "UR4253817", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Londra Palace from 16th to 20th December 2005.

The room 408 was excellant great view of the canal (facing it) If you come to venice and stay here, you must get a water taxi as it drops you off right outside the hotel...20 m walk... The only thing that lets it down is the breakfast...cold meats, biscuits, cake, fruit, cerial, youghurt. A weird combo for the english. You can buy all the good stuff but 6 euros for porridge, 6 euros for sausage, 2.5 euros for an egg (any syle) is outrageuos. Those Hilton and Marriott people have got it so right...if you gonna check out of a hotel do it after a fantastic breakfast...people will be back. The hotel is about 2 mins walk to San Marco (really) I will definatley stay here again, although I would like to try the Daniele (which is next door, although I hear the food and service is not good) It was our honey moon and we were greeted with a bottle of Prosecco. Venice However is rip off city...BEAWARE of restaurants offering a tourist menu...It is possible to eat well and affordably on the Grand Canal in the Rialto Area. I was supprised that a lot of restaraunts did not have a Pizza Kiln...they had electric ovens instead... If you like pizza hae a look in the restaurants first as some sell it in VERY small portions...it looks cheap on the menu then when you get it you know why... Go to 'Pizza de Roberto'...everyone knows it...just ask...very good. Their is a MacDonalds there also...very good...we had a very BAD meal in a restaurant in the same street as MacDonalds ...avoid them all...80 euros for rubbish, everyone was complaining and the service was shocking... Good service in Venice is hard to find... San Marco, we paid 35 euros for two cocktails. they also charge for the band that is paying 4.50 euors per person.

We found great difficulty finding reasonably priced accomodation but which was nice enough for us to celebrate a belated first wedding anniversary travelling for the first time without our 6yr old son. Tripadvisor was most usefull in finding hotels with decent reviews. The Londra Palace was ideally situated a few hundred metres from St. Marks and our room was directly overlooking the Grand Canal. We had a superior double as this was all that was available, but they let us have the room at standard rate for the Sunday night - so worth negotiating. Room was traditionally decorated in plush fabric and bathroom in pink marble although I did find it a shame that in such a beautiful old building that plastic insted of ceramic baths have been installed, and the shower over the bath resulted in a slight flood all over the bathroom floor due to a tiny glass shower door. However the balcony and view made up for it. The greatest disappointment was the breakfast. The only healthy option was the fresh fruit which was delicious, but the cereals, even the museli were all sugar coated with full cream milk. There were cakes, and bread which was rather hard, and the preserves were the most tastless I'd ever had. I did have a boiled egg one morning but was rather dismayed to see that anything hot was an extra supplement !! Venice is a definite must to see.
