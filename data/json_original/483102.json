We had never been to Barcelona before and not fully understanding the city layout for best loaction - but this was definitely it! The aerobus drops you at the Catalunya Plaza/mid way along La Rambla and is only 5 mins walk then to the hotel - perfect! On arrival we were given a glass of bubbly and a very welcoming smile. We upgraded to a Universitat room on a B&B only. 512 - very good sized room, spotless clean, with huge bed, bath robes/slippers, mini bar etc. It had a little balconey overlooking a very busy road but the french double glazed doors kept the noise out. The staff were always very helpful and friendly. Excellent choice at breakfast and is served from 08:00 to 10:30 - very civilised! And, if it does rain, the hotel has umberella's that you can use for 10euros fully refunable deposit. As for the city tours - a few words of advice. Its advisable to purchase the tour bus tickets from the hotel as they are slightly cheaper. If you, as we did, bought a one day bus pass and paid an additional fee for entry to the Camp Nou experience (Barcelona FC ground tour) ask the hotel to call them to check there are open for tours that day. We we got off the bus and got to the front of the queue, they told us that as there was a game the next day the Experience tour was closed. Upon returning to the hotel and told them what happened, they gave us a full refund for this part of the ticket, no questions asked. If you do add on extra tours to the bus ticket, ask the hotel to print of 2 copies of the pre paid vouchour, as you will need one to hand over the bus company and the other copy to hand over to the pre paid attraction you are going to visit. All in all 10 out of 10 and we can't wait to return to the city and would not dream of staying in any other hotel.

Like said previously try to keep off rambles for eat and drink as very expensive.

We complained and were told someone would absolutely combine the beds that night. We returned to the room after midnight, still two single beds. Then the street noise was abysmal, kept us up all night. We asked to switch rooms in the morning - got a third floor interior room.

Our bathroom ceiling leaked on our second night, and while they did eventually fix it that day, the workmen's boots left marks that housekeeping did not clean. Agree with others that the noise from other travellers (many young Europeans in town for NYE) was really bad. We heard the 6:30 alarm clock from room next door and had to bang on their door to wake them up to turn it off after 10 minutes. You can hear neighbor's toilet flush, etc. Just no sound barriers at all. Our fridge wasn't plugged in (no outlet nearby) and we asked for ice & ice bucket but it never arrived. I read that someone else was able to borrow a kettle, but there was no info in the room that this would have been an option when we wanted coffee.

The breakfast is priced ridiculously, 17 EUR, for below 10EUR, you can have a great breakfast anywhere within 100 meters around the hotel.

Score! The room was clean and comfortable - triple room had a double bed and a pull out in the living room area. The room also had a nice balcony with a great view of the city. In addition, there was a nice rooftop terrace with amazing views and comfy chairs - perfect place to have a pre-outing drink or just hang after a long day of sightseeing. The room included breakfast which was phenomenal, it was served in a large and comfortable dining area and offered a wide variety of items ranging from tasty local food (tortilla Espanola, cantimpalo chorizos, fried eggs) to croissants, nutella, fresh fruit, etc. The location was perfect for our needs - 2 blocks away from Las Ramblas and within walking distance of tons of shops, restaurants, and our Hop On Hop Off bus stop.

The hotel sells a city tour kit for 2 Euro savings and then you walk the 2 blocks and pay 19 Euro to the bus people.

Initially we had tried to get into the H10 Marina, which we had stayed in before, was reasonably priced and very enjoyable. This was full and so we naturally sought a hotel in the same chain. We were quoted \u20ac180 for Thursday night and \u20ac520 for Saturday night - a total of \u20ac700. For our American friends this was $1000 for a mediocre hotel. We reluctantly accepted this. The rooms are quite small - not big enough to accommodate cruise ship baggage easily. The walls are paper thin - I could hear snoring from one side and coughing from the other. When we came to collect our car from the car park we were charged \u20ac89.90, because the card provided by the hotel did not work. We complained to the staff, but after 40 minutes were informed there was nothing they could do because the car park would not reimburse them.", "Date": "May 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Driffield, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBRILLIANT\u201d", "Author": "63michelle", "ReviewID": "UR106943314", "Content": "Went for my Birthday only for two days the Hotel was brilliant very friendly great location.

The hotel also has a restuarant in the basement. We didn't have dinner there, but we had one breakfast, which was disappointing at 10 euro's, so the day after, we ate at a cafe a few doors down the road which was great at just over 8 euro's. We were only in Barcelona for a long weekend, so to see as much as we could, we took the open-top city tour bus on a 2 day ticket (cheaper booked through the hotel). The tour is highly recommended. You are given a map, a book of money off vouchers for shops, restuarants, museum's, and a host of other attractions, and earphones to plug in to the seat in front with a running commentary as the bus glides past all the sporting and cultural sites. You can get on and off at various locations along the way, as may times as you like. We took a taxi from the airport to the hotel which cost 30 euro's and about 15/20mins.

Few days before the arrival I wrote to the hotel staff requesting specifically the room overlooking the street. From my understanding the \"double gourmet\" room should have been a larger room anyway, because I red the description on the hotel website. I also indicated that we might arrive 1 hour prior to the check in time, because our flight from Toronto was cheduled to arrive at 11:40 am. The hotel responded and told me that they took the note of my request and that they were lookign forward aving us as their guests. Since our baggage was delayed we arrived at the hotel around the check-in time anyway. The lady at the front desk told us that we would be given a temporary room for one night as there was a large group occupying all other bigger rooms. She promissed that the next day they would give us the room we requested. I already did not like this \"suggestion\", but we decided to go upstairs and check the room. This is when we realised that we were given a single room with one double bed, that was even too small for one people, not to mention how it looked like with two adults and 4 suitcases. We could barely move around and in order to open the door we had to put one of the bags on the bad. Everything was so crammed and dark. After a quick shower and strech we went downstairs and demanded a larger room, an actual double room and all of a sudden we were told that a large room would be available at 6 pm. After a long walke at \"La Rambla\" we returned to the hotel and as promissed our room was ready. It was on the first floor, overlooking the street and it had two separate twin beds. The room was not as large iether, but at least we could move around and hang our clothes. There wasn't much wardrobe space for two people, but we managed it somehow. The rooms are definitely a very low point of this hotel. If you are booking a double basic room be sure that this is an acutal single room and two people cannot fit there. Make sure you request a streetview room as these are the largest rooms. Beside the room issue, we did not have any other objections. The food was amazing. The breakfast items were all fresh and there was a variety to choose from. The dinner was also outstanding and portions were very big. All the premises were extremely clean. The location was great. It ws only 2 minutes walk from La Rambla and about 25 minutes walk from Sagrada Familia or Port Vell. Cabs are very cheap in Barcelona and it is easy to move around. One thing you have to watch out in Barcelona is street pocketers. They will lure you pretending that they are police or army officers and demand to see your documents and money. Do not ever comply with their requests. The real police will never ask you for such items or if they you look suspicious you will be taken to the police station and not interrogated and searched on the streets.

The rooms have a safe located within the wardrobe where you can store your passports etc. The shower and toilet are located behind a frosted glass screen with the sink on the other side of the frosted glass - a bit odd but strangely enough it works! The room is spacious and sports a 32inch TV. As part of our room package we had strawberries dipped chocolate and a bottle of cava, which was brought up to our room about 20mins after we checked in. When we came back later that night, we found an almond cake with a strawberry on top for each of us.

The second and third morning we had breakfast downstairs in the restaurant, whcih was a nice buffet breakfast. There is a nice selection of food, ranging from a hot breakfast (sausages, bacon, fried and scrambled egg, beans and mushrooms), cereals, fruit, salad, cold meats and cheese, toast and pastries. They also offer a range of 'DIET' foods should you want to stay on a diet whilst you're there!

This means that you are extremely close to the centre of town, close to the Ramblas and the bus tours. The staff at reception were very helpful and friendly. If you want to use the Barcelona Bus Touristic sightseeing bus, then ask at the reception and they will sell you the vouchers for 4euros and then buy the ticket on the bus for 16euros, saving 2euros on the price in the main square.

The experience was very good! The Universitat Double Rooms we booked were not huge but spacious, the ventilation was silent and efficient and the breakfast was very good! Wide range of choices (not vast, but very satisfying) and most importantly: it actually TASTED good. The cakes, croisants, bacon and even the scrambled eggs were really good - not frequent as you probably know!! The automatic elevator system seemed to behave a little weird at times, but that's not really really a problem in a lowrise. Now, problems: the balcony door didn't shut totally when closed. I mean, it did close, but it wasn't very tight, so a little amount of cold air came in. Not a problem actually, we set the temperature of the room to 23 or something and didn't even feel any temperature fluctuations. Really nothing to worry about, just thought I'd write it for the review be complete. The only real problem of the room -just the one- was that the toilet was separated by just a glass wall. And although one would suppose that a glass wall would be on the side of the toilet where there's no door, this one was on the side of the room that had the toilet door on! So no blinds you can shut - obviously the glass was not transparent though. To make matters worse, it was on the side that actually faced the room door. Obviously, a door with no case can't really stop the air from flowing from the one side to the other, as it leaves half a cm of space between the door and the wall beside it. The obvious complication was that when someone had to use the bathroom a. the pleasant odor would spread to the entire room like a plague and b. if someone walks in the room or someone walks around the room he can just see inside... Being there with a friend that wasn't so terrible, but what if I was there with a co-worker? In some weird and cunning twist, we had this problem in the room with the two separate beds and NOT the room with the double bed. Kind of interesting, you would suppose that privacy was less of an issue for people who share beds. Add to that that if you forget a do-not-disturb sign and someone walks in to clean the room they'll just see what you do in the bathroom, and if they happen to see from the correct angle they'll see you perfectly clear. A nice addition was the glass curtain on the shower. No way you can be sure no one sees you there. Quite interesting. Ask for a room with normal walls around the bathroom if you need to. To end on a positive note, I wanted to keep my the about-the-staff notes for the end of the review. Everyone was friendly and welcoming and VERY helpful. Suggesting routes to visit landmarks, very helpful and efficient about airport bus and tourist bus info (incidentally, they both have a stop at Plaza Catalunya which is like 300 meters from the hotel - use them both, the airport bus normally takes less than half an hour to the new terminal and the tourist bus -especially the blue line- takes you around the city landmarks, plus you get many discount coupons with it). We were offered champagne upon arrival and check in/check out were a couple of moments each. The prices at the mini-bar seemed rather good too, although i didn't use it. On the whole, being next to Plaza Catalunya -which means also: close to Las Ramblas, Bari Gotic, Raval etc --> nightlife, food, walking around etc; just be very careful with your wallets and cameras, two of the three of us \"lost\" these) - I think H10 Universitat is a very very good choice to explore the city!

The main part of the city is at most 10 mins away and there are some fantastic restaurants and cafes in the vicinity. The room was clean and it is definitely worth asking for a room at the front of the hotel so that you can have a balcony with a view over the roofs of Barcelona. The roof top terrrace is worth a visit as I should imagine that it is a pleasant place to spend some time (we visited it during thunder storm!).

We had booked a \"romantic\" double room and were shown to room 106 on the first floor. The room was very modern, large double bed, sliding wardrobes with plenty of hanging space and drawers, plasma 32\" TV, glass bathroom with walk in shower, a vanity unit and the biggest surprise of all - a decked terrace with chairs, table and umbrella! The room was well equipped with minibar, tea and coffee making facilities, internet access and hairdryer. Part of the Romantic room package included a bottle of cava in the room, chocolate strawberries and breakfast in bed if we wanted. When we arrived back at the room at around 5pm the cava was in the ice bucket and the chocolate strawberries on a plate beside. We also received slippers and 2 bottles of water later that evening. The hotel facilities are fairly basic - bar, restaurant, conference rooms and a roof terrace. There are no leisure facilities but we didnt need them - we were visiting to take in the sights. We decided to take breakfast in the restaurant rather than in our room. The breakfast was buffet and plenty of choice. As well as the standard european continental there was also scrambleds eggs, bacon, sausages etc. All good quality and hot. Another added extra with the romanitc room was late check out at 3pm which was great as we had a late flight home. The hotel was very clean, the staff very helpful and the location was outstanding.

Overall it was a very good experience and I would recommend it, but with some caveats. Based on the recommendations form others, I joined the free H10 Club and requested an outer room on and upper floor. We wound up in room 411. The views were definitely very nice, but there was a lot of traffic noise from the street below. On top of this, the metro trains run underground very close to the hotel and produce a low rumble every couple of minutes. Also, there was a staircase just outside our room with the door propped open at all times, so you could hear people tromping up and down the stairs from several floors away. It wasn't a big deal to us, but light sleepers might have problems. Aside from the noise issues, the stay was very pleasant. The key thing was the location. The hotel is just off the Placa de Catalunya, within easy walking distance to La Rambla, the Gothic Quarter, and Eixample. For longer trips, the Universitat and Catalunya metro stops were each less than a block away. The room appeared to have been recently remodeled in a modern style and was very nice. The beds were comfortable and the climate controls worked well. Room amenities included an in-room safe, a light-blocking curtain, and a large flat-screen TV (although BBC World News was the only English channel we could find). We had breakfast included in our price and the buffet had a great selection of delicious foods. The staff at the front desk were very friendly and helpful, and the cleaning staff were efficient and unobtrusive. There were a few quirks with the bathroom. The bathroom area is walled off from the rest of the room with glass walls and a glass door. The glass door didn't close tightly like a regular door, so keep in mind that your fellow room occupant will be able to hear everything you're doing in there. Also, there was no door on the shower, just a short partition separating it from the sink, so the bathroom floor tended to get soaked while taking a shower. Other than this, the bathroom was nicely styled, clean, and functional.

Make sure you ask for an outer facing room...one that ends in 11, on a high floor. The noise from the street is not noticeable once you close the balcony doors.

The hotel is in a great location, just off the top of La Rambla and Placa de Catulunya square. We stayed in Room 511 on the 5th floor and the room was average size with a good size bedroom. There was no double bed but twin beds, but this wasn't a big deal, we just moved them together. The hotel was very quiet and we had no problems with noise during the night or from the metro.

The hotel as 2 computers with free internet access and you can use these at any time. We booked room only and decided to have breakfast in the restaurant on the 1st morning. A little on the pricey side \u20ac17 per person which is expensive just for breakfast, but it is a buffet and you can have as much as you want, so we definatley filled up and that done us until late afternoon.

A lot of people had said to me before we left that pickpocketing was a major problem in Barcelona, but I didn't see one incident the whole weekend, but was still very aware of my personal belongings and handbag etc. Some of the bars of Le Rambla are very expensive for drink, but with the Euro being so bad at the moment, this was expected.

We got off at Universistat the bus has a little screen to tell u the next stop so you won\u2019t get off at the Wong one. Once you get off the bus turn left and basically it\u2019s the street facing you down the side. If in doubt ask a policeman they all speak in English and are friendly. Its literally a 3 min walk from the bus please don\u2019t get a 30 euro taxi its 4 euro on the bus (exchange rate was one for one !!) come out of air port terminal turn right and you will see the buses they are blue and have airport bus on them. Get the bus back from plaza cataluna you will see where they all are when you walk past this area. All bus drivers speak English. Check in was fast and we had the free cava the room was at the front and on floor 4. Personally I would have preferred higher to eliminate the low rumble of the metro below the building although it did not bother me that much you can hear it and it will disturb a light sleeper other than that it was not that noisy. Room as the internet pics all nice clean and modern nice bathroom with hair dryer and lots of smellies you could just get away with taking some conditioner. The breakfast was fine lots of choice although some of it was weird to us as they cater for most countries you will find something to eat its all buffet style. Staff all ok polite enough and fairly attentive, we did not dine in the restaurant but it was \u00a320 for a 3 course meal at dinner so one of the cheaper places to eat drinks we thought where on the high side until we went on La Rambla (\u00a33.50 a bottle of san Miguel in hotel bar) bar in hotel very lifeless could be far better. There is a mini bar in the room same prices as the main bar so not that bad. It\u2019s good for keeping shop bought stuff in! We did the one day tour bus and it was ace worth the \u00a320 each as in total its about 6 hours you don\u2019t have to sit on get on and off when you want with your all day pass. The Guell park is a must wow factor. The port is nice and mounturic in fact all over is fab. I know its tempting but try not to eat and drink on the rambla its sooooo expensive and if you must eat and drink on it go for the menu of the day with a drink if poss this starts from \u00a38 per person sounds cheap but add another drink and it will be as much as double ! we had 2 pints of larger (local stuff one small cava and a small water for \u00a325.00 I almost fell on the floor another place to avoid is the jazz bar down stairs a few doors away from the hotel \u00a318 for 2 very small cocktails. All I can say is check the menu for the prices before you enter or you WILL get stung. Most other places where fair expensive to eat and drink we spent a small fortune and we did not do half the things we could have (not because of money but we ran out of time) Average beer price is about \u00a35-\u00a37 a pint in the popular tourist places if you get away from the main parts we found places that it was \u00a32.50 a pint. The best places we found for food and drink at reasonable prices where behind the hotel. If you walk out of the hotel turn left keep going until the end of the rd turn left again go to the top of the street and there is a bar on the corner all La Tromia right across the rd is Contedell Citual or something along those lines also there is Obhmas next door (more expensive tho) these 2 bars have excellent Tapa (contedell is the best) its not to dear small beer I think was about \u00a31.40 and the Tapas was from a few pounds up to about \u00a310. Stay clear of the Ibrirco Ham is very expensive indeed about \u00a316.00 for a small plate (it\u2019s the best I have ever had tho) I wish I had found these bars sooner as we ended up in and about La Rambla a lot. The old town Barri Gottic is a bit cheaper as well. There is a nice oyster bar Vildsvin if you come across it do go in it has very fresh oysters (try them if u have never had them they are nice but slimy!). Obamas is just a bar really but had a good atmosphere. Drinking and eating around the hotel and round the back of the hotel was the best bet for the best food and drink. We went to the market with high hopes of having some nice food but all the little cafes where packed out it was an amazing market and worth a visit. The street entertainers on La Rambla are good but do give them a euro if you want to take a photo this is how they make a living. One word of warning its very easy to wander off the beaten track with all the side streets they are all dark and narrow and can feel intimidating. We ended up I think in ravel (not 100% tho) at night time it was only about 10pm but we came out of the back door of the supermarket on La Rambla (carrforre) and ended up a bit lost the area was or seemed dodgy so please be careful. Lucky we did not get robbed or anything but it would have been easy for someone to do it to us. Like any city keep your bag close and gents keep money and wallets in your front pocket. All in all it was a nice break not sure I would go again for all over Christmas as I did miss home and thought it would be a bit more Christmassy but it was a bit of a let down in that area, however they don\u2019t celebrate at the same time us (Prague is fab at Christmas) The weather was fine for the first 2 days sunny and about 17 degrees and it was about 20 on Xmas day, boxing day hammered it down so take a very large sturdy umbrella with you. There are lots of shops in Barcelona but again are quite expensive with the euro being so strong against the pound, but it\u2019s nice to look in the windows of prada and Gucci etc. You will have a good time just keep off the big tourist areas to eat and drink go to the Aquarium that was good (\u00a317 each to get in) there is the Zoo we did not visit tho and of course the Guell park where Gaudi art is amazing and the Sagradi Familiar is a must see. There are lots of other things to do just check out trip advisor. Any questions just email me. All in all I would stay in the hotel again but would like a higher floor I think it was about right for what we paid quality wise.

I've seen my share of hotels, some good and some bad. Generally, what sticks out in my mind when I am contemplating rebooking at a hotel is the type of service that the hotel provides. We arrived in Barcelona early on the morning of September 14th. We were on the last leg of a nine European trip. We originally scheduled to leave the hotel on the 17th, but we were hoping to leave one day early on the 16th as we were getting a little tired from our trip. We spoke with two people at the front desk. The second one assured us, that since they have a 24 hour cancel policy, it was OK that we canceled our room for the night of the 16th so we could leave a day early. We ended up leaving the hotel the morning of the 16th and returing to the U.S. Upon my return home, I realized that we were charged for all three nights. I have since contacted them several times and they are telling me that they can't (or won't) refund my money for the last night we canceled because neither of the people at the desk documented it. So, now they are just saying it is my word against theirs. At 145 Euro (roughly $210), this is no cheap mistake on their part. Yet, we are the only ones paying for it. Very disappointing!!! The hotel itself is pretty nice (great breakfast). Except, I do not recommend staying in the rooms that end with 10, as they are the small rooms that everybody is complaining about.

The room was immaculate and completely modern and stylish, with all glass paneling separating the bedroom from the bathroom (don't worry, its frosted).

The in-room free wireless Internet access was easily set up, reliable, and fast.

We had nowhere to put our suitcases other than to push them to one side close the room door and put them back in front of the door. The room was so small we felt like we were in a prison cell not the hotel room we had expected. Also the bed was the hardest i have ever slept in or not slept . We returned to the reception desk to ask to be moved to a bigger room as in our opinion the room was only suitable for a single traveller. They agreed the room was indeed very small but could nothing to help us as the hotel was full. We were only too glad we had only booked for one night as there was no was we could have stayed longer. Its a great shame the hotel feels it needs to maximise it's bookings to the extent of upsetting customers so they feel even though the location, breakfast and general decor was very nice they would not dare to return for fear of a repeat performance. We did note that the bathroom set up ie:- toothbrushes etc:- were indeed set for only one person. so i would question why?. I booked our hotel room about 3 months before our travel date so i can only assume it was felt as we were only staying for one night it didn't matter where they put us.

Barcelona is a wonderful, vibrant, and exciting town. We were there for a short trip, but we really enjoyed our stay. I would definitely recommend the hotel. We paid about $100/nt. But after looking just today at a couple dates, the rooms seem to be running the $200/nt range. I was just happy to find a decent room that was under $300/nt at the end of December, which was a definite feat.. 2-star hotels in decent areas were averaging $300/nt during that time, but after reading all the reviews for the H10 on TripAdvisor and elsewhere, I felt confident that the room would be great at the $100/nt price as long as we weren't in one of their known very small rooms. I emailed H10 Universitat to confirm that the room was paid for at the wonderful price I found, since I couldn't find that price even close on their website. I also emailed them to request one of the known larger rooms. We were accomodated very nicely. I believe we received one of the largest rooms for their hotel. I believe it was 712. Far enough away from the passing subway underneath the hotel. We received a complimentary glass of Cava upon check-in, and we also had access to the breakfast buffet - which was pretty good. One caveat about the breakfast buffet. On the day of our check-out, they wanted to charge us for the breakfast, but that makes no sense. Your check in time at 3pm doesn't allow you to take advantage of the breakfast buffet so you miss this day, but you expect to have it the day of your departure. After explanation, we did receive the breakfast free - although I didn't eat it because I had lost my appetite. Our room had a nice balcony, and we would leave the door open to hear the sounds of the city. The street is busy below, but we weren't in our room much. The room was very clean, and had the proper storage and amenities. I don't believe we did get the hot tea service to work, but again, it was a short stay, so we didn't request it to be fixed during our stay. The weird thing was the shower/tub had half a glass door so water would splash outside the tub onto the floor. I was prepared for this in previous reviews, and it was definitely manageable with a quick swipe of a dry towel. I just don't get the weird shower \"door\". Overall, I would recommend the H10 Universitat without hesitation. I don't know what similar hotels are priced during a \"normal\" season, so I can't compare. I'd say if you can get the room for less than $150, you might be doing good. The ease of access to everything was spectacular. As long as you are up to walking (and I have a bad knee), you can pretty much stay anywhere and enjoy being in that part of town as each part of town has an interesting flair about it.

The best thing about the hotel was the location and for the price we paid (339 Euros for 3 nights including breakfast) it was a really good deal. We didn't have any problems with pickpockets whilst there even though it was our biggest worry about going to Barcelona after all the horror stories we had read. Hubby used a discreet money pouch and didn't carry a wallet.

This hotel isn't special or memorable, but is spotlessly clean, conveniently located, solid service, and is excellent value for a hotel in Europe ONLY IF YOU BOOK THE RIGHT ROOM. 1) Request to be on floor 5 or above and request a room ending with 01, 02, 11 or 12. These are large and front facing, and have mini balconies. These are the best rooms. 2) Hotel has 8 floors. 8 floor has 2 junior suites. I was in 711. The room is front facing outlooking a major street - didn't hear any noise from the traffic or from other guests and I am an extremely light sleeper. 3) Do NOT stay in room numbers ending in the following: 05, 06, 07, 08. I peered in one, and it is extremely small looking out to a shaft. Please see my map photos for reference (the inner rooms). If I got stuck in one of these hole in the walls, I would of rated this hotel a one star. 4) Room 512 is the room they have advertised on the website Other critical tips: 5) Book directly via the website H10 and save money. H10 is a chain. Select the Universitat location. A few days before your travel, double check the rate per night online. I did and was able to save 40 Euros per night as the price dropped. So, I just cancelled my first reservation and rebooked at the lower rate. Note you are able to cancel 24 hours online vs. if you call the hotel directly it requires 48 hours. Specify room and floor preference in the notes section. 6) Book with the breakfast option. Great variety, great value, and delicious! The pot of coffee each morning was a great start. 7) Take the airport bus to the hotel and get dropped off at Universitat street. You will then need to walk about 1 block to the hotel. Take the airport bus back to the airport from Placa Cataluyna. Everyone takes it. It's convenient (comes every 10 minutes) and cheap (under 4 Euros per person). Note: If you are looking for a hotel with a pool or bar scene or spa atmosphere this is not the place for you. It's a great hotel for the practical tourist traveler or business traveler.

Practicaly, if the bed was a little bit closer you couldn't open the room's door. The sink was directly in the room, separeted from the shower and toillet. There is no tub. All the windows could be oppened only from down to up, not in the normal way. The closet was absolutely useless, beeing very, very small. The receptionist told us that is a bigger, quiet room. We try to sleep with all the windows open but fom the outside came a enoyng noise from the A/C and a powrfull smell of garlic, I don't know where from. The walls of the room are probably made of paper, I could hear very well a man next to our room snoring, and all the conversation from the lobby. Next day we changed the room with an other one facing the main street (511). It was a little bigger and has the sink, the tollet and the shower (with tub) completly separted from the room. Same problems with the closet, the walls and everything else. There's a little bit street noise in the night so you can sleep quite well. I read that many people enjoy breakfast, but is far from fantastic. Two years ago we spend two nights in a 2 star hotel in Madrid, and there's no diffrence regarding breakfast. Is a quite normal one. The only bad thing is that you have to stay in line untill a waitter came to you and ask you the room number and then he or she show you the table where to stay. The restaurant is divided in two rooms: one is the waitting room and the other is dining room. The funny thing is that the waitting room is almost bigger than the other so is a little bit stupid to put people on wait.

We booked last minute, we were not quite sure where to go, but we were determined to get a chance of some sun after a poor summer in Glasgow. It was the only weekend my wife and myself have off together until November. Booked the flights through Flyglobespan on the Tuesday morning. Not cheap but not too bad at \u00a3320 return for two. My wife works with Thomson and we were looking at booking the accommodation through them and using her yearly voucher. We found that good hotels in good locations were hard to come by and prices were on the high side, my brother and sister in law had visited Barcelona two weeks earlier at half the price for flights and accommodation. We decided on the H10 Universitat on location, cost and because we had stayed in the H10 in Tenerife, Costa Adeje earlier in the year. I quickly checked trip advisor for ratings, with mostly 4 and 5's I didn't bother reading through the reviews. We checked prices through Thomson web page, for my wife to use her voucher she has to phone Thomson Hotels. The online price was around \u00a3440, phone price \u00a3760. (room only) I therefore decided to book online. There was an option to take breakfast, they wanted \u00a380. I thought I'll check the price on the H10 website, room price was the same but for breakfast they only wanted 40 Euros for the four nights for the two of us. So we booked direct with H10, 670 Euros for four nights including breakfast. Flights went well. We decided to take the A1 bus from outside of Terminal A direct into Placa de La Universitat. The hotel is only a 5 min walk from here. (You could stay onto Placa Catalunya, six and half a dozen) Check in was excellent, they had our reservation in hand and we were given room 310. After a complimentary glass of Cava it was off to the room. Did I say room? Sorry I meant cupboard. There was barely enough space to get round the bed and no where to store our cases other than in the reasonably large shower room. So it was straight back down the stairs to reception. They didn't look too surprised to see us. Unfortunately being a very busy weekend we were told they had nothing else available for that day but would move us the next day. We were just to leave our bags in our cupboard and they would move when we were out and about. So we decide to stay and headed back up to our cupboard. To be honest it was a four star cupboard with all the fixtures and fittings you'd expect, We even had free Wifi. The shower/toilet is separated from the room with a smoked glass wall/sliding door. Shower was excellent and a very good size considering the size of our \"room\". Room was a wee bit noisy, close to lift and exacerbated due to the slight gap in the door, not big enough to see through though We were indeed moved as promised. We were given room 707. This is at the back of the building. Room size was good and again with all the usual 4 star bits and pieces and free wifi. Bed was massive and comfy. Both rooms were very clean and tidy. 707 could do with a new floor but overall we were happy. Breakfast was excellent value. They did have sausage bacon and egg available but not quite up to UK standards. Eggs were always cold. However this is the norm in European hotels, the selection of cheese, cold meats, fruit and pastries easily made up for the failings in their cooked breakfast. They also leave out water and snacks through out the day. The location of the hotel is excellent just along from Placa Catalunya and the Ramblas. City bus tours leave from Place Catalunya, I suggest you take the two day ticket. On returning to the airport we took the Airport bus ( A1) from Placa Catalunya. The H10 Universitat would easily get a 5 rating if it wasn't for the small internal rooms. My wife, who is an agent for Thomson, would not risk putting clients into this hotel unless they were given assurances that they would not be put in an internal room. H10 should place single beds in all the internal rooms and charge a fare rate. If the Hotel is reasonably full there is a good chance you will end up in the \u201cshoe box\u201d rooms.

Our room was on the sixth floor and was really small, but it was perfect for a couple who only used it to wash and sleep. The bathroom was large in comparison to the room and had a fabulous power shower. A point here is that the bedroom and bathroom are separated by a frosted glass wall so all the sounds of the bathroom can be heard in the bedroom. You need to be comfortable with your partner!!! We only had breakfast once and although there was a great deal of choice it was very expensive (37 Euros for 2 people). I would recommend going out for breakfast, there are plenty of cafes around.

After much exploring ,this hotel appeared to have the least adverse remarks. Comments were made about various rooms and sizes. I booked through Hotelopia , I asked for a large outside room with bath and shower on floor 4 or above and received a very good deal. On arrival we were greeted with a glass of Cavas and a delightful attitude.Apologies were made that the floor requested was not available but we were allocated an excellent large room with bath and shower on floor 2. The general standard of the hotel is first class, the bedroom was of the highest standard (comments regarding the glass doors to bathroom and lack of privacy are unfounded) the bathroom does have a glass door but is totally opaque. The breakfast gives the most expansive choice I have ever seen in any hotel. Coming back on an afternoon there is a selection of tit-bits to eat available in the bar together with water and hot drinks. The position of the hotel is excellent and is just 500 metres from Las Ranbles which means there is no problems with noise. Overall this is the best value for money hotel I have stayed in. The decor is fresh and modern, the staff are efficient but cheerful, the rooms first class with a daily change of linen and the breakfast is out of this world and includes a full grill if this is your fancy. This hotel must be the gem of Barcelona. Just a little tip, the taxi fare from the hotel is more than 30 euro, the airport bus is 3.75. This hotel is 500 metres from Place Catalunya, the terminus for the bus. We paid for a taxi (33 euro) which includes a airport surcharge. My advice is take the bus, (we did on return and it only takes 20 mins from Catalunya Place) and if you have difficulty finding your hotel, then take a taxi from Catalunya place.

Having a rental car we approached the hotel on the street and found there to be nowhere to park our car and unload our luggage, except for the very busy Taxi/Bus lane. After a record unload time of 1 minute, my husband drove around looking for a parking garage while I checked in. Luckily, there was a garage relatively close, but not associated with the hotel. The hotel accomodated my request of being on the 4th floor or higher, as I have read on Trip Advisor. We were given room 608 which was a middle room - where the window look into some type of elevator shaft-ish opening. We were not offered any cava or snacks like the previous reviewers upon check in. The room was so small, we had to keep one of our suitcases in the bathroom and the other in the bedroom. The closet was really of no use as it was so tiny. We wondered why the bathroom was so humongous at the expense of the living area where they jammed in a king size bed. The bed pillow spanned the entire width of the bed, and there was only one...this I named the \"siamese pillow\" as we both tried to get the proper placement for sleeping. That was something I'd never experienced. The mattress was also quite hard. The water pressure in the shower was excellent (we did not have a tub) and as the other reviewers stated, the bathroom was \"in the room\" separated by a wall of frosted glass. The A/C was lacking power and one of the vents had some very disturbing looking black mold/soot/etc....that made you wonder if it was toxic. The one highlight was the wonderful breakfast buffet that was included in our room rate. One of the best buffets we have ever seen - and everything very tasty. Service was excellent as well. Also, the free internet access in the business center was most appreciated. We chose H10 Universitat for it's close proximity to Las Ramblas, which is definitely true, and also to the Metro at Plaza Catalunya.

I'm never going to use Venere again. Although I received a good price (I think), when we checked in at midnight after a long flight and metro ride, we were shocked at how bad our room was. It was extremely small, which wouldn't have bothered us so much, but it was very depressing and poorly designed. It was an inside room overlooking a light well, and the window opened in over the bed so it would bang your head. The room smelled funny (like turpentine or paint), and the bathroom was in the room, separated by frosted glass. The pergo floor was peeling off, and the furniture was banged up and the bedspread stained. We were depressed. The room certainly wasn't worth $125 euros, and this wasn't where we wanted to spend the night, let alone the next four nights. We asked to change rooms, and were told there was nothing available that night. We went out and walked around the vicinity looking for another hotel. Everything was booked up. The next morning I went downstairs and told them we were unhappy with our room, and the desk girl said she would change us to a double room (2 beds) at noon. She seemed used to the problem. The new room was an outside room, although not looking out at anything, and was kind of dark-but what a difference. It was twice the size of the other room, and much more normal. The hotel staff was very courteous and helpful. The free internet was great. The complimentary drinks and snacks every evening were very nice also. When you book with Venere I found out that breakfast is not included with the price. Otherwise it was $20, which we weren't willing to pay. If we had booked with the hotel it would have been included. Lots of people seemed to be enjoying it. I think we also could have specified a nicer room if we had contacted the hotel directly.

The room we got on the first floor hosted periodic rumblings from the subway beneath - to be heard both during the day (or mid-mornings as we arose to new days) and until the last trains at night. I only mention the point during the day as in most cases, you might already be out sight-seeing, but during the early mornings, you would hear the first trains. I think that if you also notice this during day time with ambient noise, then it is loud enough to pose a problem at quieter times. Finally, the walls were also quite thin and we were blessed with a snorer on holiday in the next room. So for a few nights as we'd be settling in to bed, those darn rumbles then assaulted us from both beneath the floor and through the wall nearest to our heads.

I initially booked the hotel through a booking website but decided to contact them directly, and in by doing so, I got a better rate inclusive of breakfast for 2 persons at 140E per night. Initially, the booking websites were quoting 160E per night without breakfast, so it's best to contact them directly first. I also requested for a nice large room with view on the upper floors, and when we got there, they were able to grant our request and gave us room 701 - a nice big room (twin beds together but not a problem) with a nice terrace facing Ronda Universitat and minimal traffic noise because it was high above the street (8th floor was the highest). I guess we were quite lucky that this room was available because some rooms are indeed just half the size of this room with no terrace at all. Our room was pleasingly comfortable and clean. Wide assortment of bathroom amenities, and shower stall was spacious. A huge buffet breakfast is served at the basement with a nice assortment of warm food (bacon, sausages, eggs etc), cold cuts, cheeses, fruits, cereals, yogurts, pastries, breads, and juices. They do serve brewed coffee or tea in a pot, but do ask for their cappucino instead. I live in Italy and I must say, they serve really great cappucinos! Location wise, this hotel is great. It is right off Plaza Catalunya, in the heart of the city so everything is close by. The street it is on is a major street so it is safe and not seedy. You can easily walk to Las Ramblas, P de Gracia or Rambla Catalunya, take your pick. Restaurants, cafes, shopping, transport are all close by. When you check out, you can leave your bags with them until you depart for the airport. Good thing is they have a locked left luggage room and they issue tags. Some hotels don't issue tags and some just leave the bags in the lobby where people can just walk off with it. Above all, I think what will make me come back to this hotel is the service of the staff - from reception, to the breakfast staff, to the cleaning staff. Everyone was smiling and ready to help.

Two rooms for four men from Philadelphia, PA, USA. Although, not particularly relevant for this trip, all four of us are \"gay.\" It was my partner and I - not too mature, yet; and two other quite mature friends. Booked with hotel direct and got best price anywhere at 135 Euro with the breakfast. Email communication with the hotel may have gotten us the best rooms in the hotel. Note: TripAdvisor User for many years and very remiss about doing reviews. Must state that I do not think I have ever gone wrong using thier advice. We have traveled quite a bit; over 30 trips to Europe alone in the last 15 years. You need assess your own values and requirements. Also, to better reflect on my comments some particulars: Marriott Platinum and somewhat \"Americanized\" - not necessarily have to live with the \"natives\" or community. Stay at Marriotts when price and location are correct. Will spend a bit more, if Marriott location is right like Vienna Marriott and Renaissance Chancery Court London (very or too expensive at times); Marriott Milan, Italy is a good hotel, but not at the center of town, so we stayed at TripAdvisor recommended hotel on the next vist. Location, with price in mind, and the acceptable standards for an Americanized traveler are the foremost attributes. As for location, being in the heart of everything, dispite noise and crowds. When we stayed in Venice at the TripAdvisor Recommended Best Western Monte Carlo Hotel, the key deciding factor was a review that stated, \"if you are person that would not like staying in Times Square NYC, like I am, you do not want to stay here.\" That clinched my decision, and that is where we stayed and it was just great. H10-Universitat was the most perfect location of almost any hotel in Barcelona. It is a block from the Ramblas and Catalunya Square: Aeroport Bus Stop (3.90 Euro) the way to go, the two day on and off Tour Bus ( a must at 23 Euro), restaurants, huge Corte de Englais Department Store, and everything at your beckon call, including two Metro stops within a block. It also sits right on the corner of the renowned \"Gayborhood\" of Barcelona. Walking distance to most clubs and restaurants. This hotel location is probably better choice and less costly than the Axel, which appears very attractive, for gays who want to actually tour and visit. Good meals for the entire visit at moderate prices, but best two meals were in gay oriented, but open to all, restaurants. In Spain five or six times and best eating ever in Spain. Our hotel rooms adjoined in front and on main street of hotel 611 and 612 (seventh floor). With balcony doors open; it was noisy, but no problem for us, otherwise. It appears there are approximately 12 rooms on each floor. The eight front and rear rooms appear to be the largest , with the four center section rooms being small. The large rooms are a wonderful size for Europe at these prices. Beds were very firm. I prefer this, but maybe just a bit too hard for me. Bathrooms were superb. We always take our own washcloth to Europe, but second day hotel left them. Toletries were partcularly nice. Can't imagine what anyone's complaint would be about the glass opaque bathroom doors. Our companions had that in their adjoining room and it afforded all the privacy and are particularly attractive. Breakfast lavishly supplied, but in the European manner and tastes. We gave a 20 Euro gratuity for the breakfast staff at the end of our stay. A wonderful time in a beautiful city that turned out to be more interesting than ever suspected.

There was some noise within the hotel. We could hear people in the hall, and muffled sounds of people using a bathroom somewhere, but that was minor. My guess is that the sound was due to the lack of carpets in the halls and in the room. But the flip side of no carpets is that the room was probably cleaner. The maid service was also perfect.

We were extremely pleased our 7 days at the H10 Universitat for many of the reasons listed in the reviews we read. Specifically: -- The location cannot be beat. You are steps away from Plaza Catalunya and access to both the Metro and commuter train lines. It gave us quick access to every major venue in Barcelona. -- The ratio of value/money was off the charts. We ended up getting a good deal through an aggregator, but we would have paid even more for the extremely clean room, the friendly staff who helped a couple who don't speak a lick of Catalan, the excellent breakfast we enjoyed as part of our package and the excellent views. -- We took the suggestions of several on the site and asked for a balcony on a high floor. It was an excellent one. Though we stayed on the back of the hotel the first night (note: ideal for people who want to sleep with their windows open but still have quiet), the staff was able to switch us after that. We were on the 5th floor overlooking Ronda Universitat and the views were excellent. For those worried about street noise (something you can't escape, even on a high floor), the balcony doors were thick, double-paned glass with a good seal. When you closed the door, you didn't hear a thing. -- Did I mention the staff? Very gracious. Always polite and quick to wish us hello or goodbye as we left the hotel. They booked dinner for us one evening and drew us maps to get there. -- Our only criticisms are this: 1) The beds were ok, but frankly after the mini-revolution in comfortable beds at hotels here in the states (I mean, even the lower-end chains have great beds now), the extremely firm mattress took a little getting used to. 2) The bathrooms on the front of the hotel have a tub with a handheld shower nozzle that you can take off of its rest and use, but the glass protecting the rest of the bathroom from spray is only half as long as the tub. The result? There was a fair amount of water on the floor. 3) We had wireless access for the laptop but, honestly, it was a little weak. i only learned on the last day that there was an ethernet cable on the bottom of the desk. I would imagine rooms in the center of the floor would have a stronger wireless signal. -- Again, the location. We were able to walk up into Eixample or down into the Gothic district easily. La Rambla is at the bottom of the Plaza. We had a train to Valencia which was easily accesible by Metro to the Sants station on the green line. There are a few close convenience stores which were perfect for a late-night snack. All of the northbound commuter trains terminate at Plaza Catalunya, so there is quick access to them (perfect for getting to Tibidabo). This was a fantastic place to stay.

Eurobus travels from the airport (just outside) to \"Plaza de Catalunya\" and back every 8-12 minutes (3.5EUR pp). The hotel is situated 3-4 minutes walk from there. 2) Breakfast is excellent. Try if possible to include it in the hotel price (as otherwise it does not come cheap 15EUR pp). Most of the online sites do not include breakfast in their offers. We booked from a travel agent and recieved a better price from all the online ones (expedia, hotels.com etc.) + breakfast. 3) Many people complained about the small rooms. Some however said that the rooms were fine. When we booked our room we specifically asked for the room numbers (literally!!) of the poeple who wrote good things on their rooms size. The hotel of course cannot ensure specific rooms (and it didn't) but at least in our case we got what we wanted. The room (not surprisingly) was large and confertable with a little balkony (Room 512). Looks through the reviews and add other series. Worth trying... 2 little bad points: 1) If you are suffering from noise to large extent, the room we satyed at (and I guess all rooms) have a little (very little) background buzz of the street below (which is a main road with heavy traffic). 2) My wife complained that there are no English speaking TV channels on the TV (beside CNN).

I picked it after reading Trip Advisor and I am pleased with my choice. We had a lovely room at the front however had to move rooms after the first night due to the noise from the traffic, sirens etc. at all hours of the night. The hotel is on one of many busy roads and Barcelona is an all night city! Our room at the back also had high quality fittings and was likewise very clean and tasteful. However it was smaller and ideally we would have liked the larger room. The whole hotel is very clean and modern although it housed in a typical Barcelona terrace. The breakfast buffet is well worth the extra 7 euros. It has absolutley everything from sausage and fried and scrambled eggs to sponge cake! I particularly liked the fresh fruit salad. You can also ask for double espressos and a jug of hot milk. Location very central as we like to walk to shops etc. You can walk up the Passeig de Gracia for posh shops and fabulous buildings or down the way for the Rambla and the atmospheric gothic quarter.

Although our room was at the front after we closed the balcony doors it was amazing how quiet the room was with only a distant rumbling from the metro. Some of the fittings in the room were a little tired but the location, size of room and most of all the amazing staff more than made up for this. Try and get a deal with the hot buffet breakfast thrown in - its really worth it - fantastic variety and that great service again. They also serve free rolls and pastries in the afternoon (in the bar area) - just right after a days sightseeing when you have come back for that shower and a siesta to set you up for the evening! For great Tapas try La Boqeria Market off La Ramblas - walk right to the back and have your super-fresh sea food cooked right in front of you at La Boqeria tapas bar - wonderful!! If you are there spring to end of September also try the night tour on the open top 'Bus Turistic' - very romantic and Barcelona by night is gorgeous!

My only problem I had was with the size of the room, myself and wife have travelled all over Europe in the last few years and the room we were given for our 2 night stay here was the \"smallest\" room we ever stayed in, we were lucky enough to only have 2 small bags with us and no way could you fit a suitcase if we had one, we even had to get out of each others way going around the bed there was so little space. The bathroom is only a glass petition between bedroom and batroom which I found very odd. As this is one of the more expensive hotels in Barcelona we were disapointed in the room size for a 4 star hotel.

As per previous posts you can hear the metro trundling underneath the hotel but this again was minimal. The staff were very helpful right from the speedy check in to the end of our stay. Breakfast was buffet style and was included in my price. It was good value everything you could want in a breakfast. It is also a 5 minute walk from the main hub of the city and La rambla. This is a 4 star hotel bordering on a 5*. I got a good deal when i booked direct with the hotel.

We had asked for a quiet room when we booked online. The hotel staff noted this when we checked in (without our prompting) and gave us a room on the highest floor away from the main street. It was nice of them to accommodate us. Unfortunately we got a room that was rather small for two. Looking at the floor plan, which is near the elevator, we gathered that there are two or three room sizes for double occupancy, and ours was in the smallest class. We asked to change room after this discovery, but it was too late by that time because other guests have checked in. If you decide to stay at this hotel, and you find that your room is a little small, you might want to check the floor plan to confirm this. Remember rooms for the same occupancy (and probably same price) are not all equal in size. We also found that our door does not block out hallway noises very well. Luckily the guests on our floor were not noisy, but we could hear them coming and going. On the plus side, the room was well maintained, with clean, modern styling. The bed was firm and comfortable, although the sheets were a little rough on the skin. We liked the little conveniences provided with the room, like the electronic safety box and the powerful hair dryer.

First of all I must say something about the hotel's location. It is perfectly placed for sight seeing, shopping and dining. It is only a couple of blocks from Plaza Catalunya from where you can travel by metro, train or bus to almost anywhere in the city. This is also where all the bus tours (costing 17 Euros for 1 day or 21 for 2 days) begin and end plus you are close to the Passeig de Gracia (wonderful examples of Gaudi's architecture and great shops) and La Rambla - not a favourite of mine. You are in strolling distance of Port Vell and just around the corner from the Barri Gotic AND the airport bus - costing 3 Euros - stop a few metres away. You can also get an air conditioned train, directly to the airport from Plaza Catalunya at a cost of only 2 Euros. How brilliant is that! In terms of the hotel itself - after reading, on this site, about the traffic noise and the pokiness of the rooms on the lower floors, I emailed the hotel, requesting rooms on the 7th floor. They were very pleasant in their response but said they could not guarantee where rooms would be situated but would do their best to grant my request when we arrived. So I was really pleased when we checked in to discover that our rooms were on the 7th floor. The cold glass of cava, offered to all guests on check-in, free of charge, added to my delight. I had a single room and my two friends shared a twin. Both rooms were lovely. The twin was spacious enough for two women with far too much stuff for only a 2 night stay and my room had a double bed and a huge bathroom with a superb shower and (all the women I know appreciate this) a well lit, adjustable make-up mirror. Though we had no view to speak of the rooms were light, extremely clean, very quiet and well appointed with safes, independent air con and heating system, toiletries - including toothbrushes, and plenty of wardrobe space and hangers. The mini bar was well stocked and reasonably priced and I loved the plasma screen TV in my room. The staff were friendly, polite and very attentive. The buffet breakfast which was included in the price (150 Euros/\u00a3100 per night for the twin room and 120 Euros/\u00a380 for single) was excellent, offering everything from a wide selection of fresh fruit, fresh fruit juices, cereals, hot and cold food, cheeses, cakes, a choice of teas, coffees and best of all - Cava. My only complaint is about the water temperature which was very unstable. Second after achieving the perfect temp the water would go cold so showering was a bit frustrating. Also the flooring was a little dodgy. They have used a laminate and it is beginning to move and lift a little. That apart I really liked this hotel and would definitely stay there again which I hope woun't be too far in the future. A TIP - the queues for the tour buses in Plaza Catalunya were very long. Save yourself the boredom of a tedious wait by getting on the bus in the street just across from the hotel. Come out of the hotel, cross the street, go right then first left. The bus stop is at the end of this road on the other side. This is the pen-ultimate stop before the tour ends and the bus is almost empty so no waiting and plenty of room on the top.

Our experience was mainly very positive. Prior to our stay (having read the reviews on tripadvisor) we had requested a larger room above the 4th floor. When we got there we were indeed allocated a large room on the 7th floor. We were not offered any cava on arrival but the room was ready when we got there at 12 noon so that was more important. The room was at the front of the hotel, clean and spacious with two large single beds (which we pushed together) and a wonderful bathroom with the most amazing shower and plenty of storage space next to the sink for toiletries. The air-conditioning is extremely efficient (it was 28 degrees outside) and so quiet that we weren't sure it was working when we first got to the room. The hotel is located a couple of minutes away from plaza catalunya, less than five minutes from Las Rambla or the much better Rambla Catalunya (go here for the best meals and evening drinks rather than Las Rambla which is overpriced and poor quality). We walked nearly everywhere during our stay and only took the metro/buses when we got too weary or to go to Parc Guell and Tibidabo which is well worth it for the view. We can't comment on the breakfast as we didn't try it, however, 14 Euros per person seems way over the top and we had breakfast at various places in the neighbourhood, from hot baguettes and coffee for under 10 euros total to pastries and coffee for under 5 euros total. We did have a couple of problems at the hotel: 1. When we got there the minibar was not stocked up. 2. There are coffee/tea making facilies in the room but our housekeeper never stocked up the tea and coffee and we had to ask at reception every day. 3. To open the doors for the small balcony you had to obtain a key from reception of which there was only one for the whole hotel - a bit odd for a four star and very inconvenient. 4.

Breakfast was excellent with a large choice of high quality hot and cold fayre. It really set us up well for the day. The staff were all very pleasant and helpful. I would have given this hotel 4 'dots' had it not been for the fiasco over billing which I only discovered when we got back to the UK. I paid with a Nationwide Visa card which I use because Nationwide do not make any charges for currency conversion. We had been quoted a price of 85 euros a day beforehand and all of the booking details were quoted in euros. When I got home I realised that instead of euros I had been charged in \u00a3 sterling. What's more , the credit card voucher which I had signed said \" I accept that I have been offered a choice of currencies for payment, I accept the conversion rate and final amount\". NO SUCH CHOICE WAS OFFERED. Despite 6 weeks of copious correspondence and complaint to the hotel manager they insisted that they were in the right. I reckon the currency 'con' cost me around 15 euros - not a huge amount but I object to being ripped off by anyone by any amount. But here's the real incredible bit. The hotel manager, whilst maintaining they had done nothing wrong, said he would collect the 15 euros from his staff if I sent him my address!! I reminded him that the company policy was the problem and not the staff and told him not to bother. This is a growing practice so beware. Rather than charging the bill in euros, the foreign firms are converting it to sterling on the spot, making a hefty profit on the exchange rate. There is currently nothing that UK credit card companies can do about it although I think they're on the case according to other websites. Out of principle I won't be returning to the H10 group which is a pity for them as we take up to 6 european breaks each year.

We got a room at first facing the street but the streetnoice and subway disturbed our sleep at night so we changed to a room at the 7th floor facing the backyard. It was so much better and quiet but a bit smaller and due to the windows the toilet and shower was a bit tiny. If you go there you should absolutly try to get a room facing the street at the upper floors! Better space and better bathroom with tub instead. Two nights we got disturbed by people talking in the corridor but we called the reception and they got up at once and told them to be quiet. Sound from the corridor easily gets through the doors but it was only the nights between friday and sunday we herd anything. Breakfast buffet was included in the 85\u20ac we payed per night and it was excellent, even better than at the 5 star luxury hotel we stayed at in Madrid last year. The staff was helpful, some were more helpful and more nice than others as it always is. I beleve that you not can expect same service in Spain as in my home country Sweden, you totally feel a difference in shops and restaurants... The staff could recommend restaurants but since they handn't tried them i think you better find other sources to get recommendations. We ate at a restaurant at Rambla first night but it was overpriced and terrible so I recommend you go somewhere else to eat, except for one restaurant; Attic close to Placa Catalunya, it was great. Attic belongs to a chain of restaurants in Barcelona so you can get similar food at different restaurants. I could stay at the hotel again but 7 days in Barcelona is enough for me for some years.

This hotel gets high marks for striking modern design, cleanliness, friendliness of staff, great breakfast, and perfect location (a block from the metro and 2 from the Ramblas). However, there were a few things that knocked it down in my book. First, as the hotel was filled to capacity, the staff seemed to have some issues with handling efficiency. The maid continually \"forgot\" to put things in one of our rooms (one day it was soap, the next enough bath towels, the next clean glasses). Each time I asked for and was presented the items with a smile, but each time it was clear she had simply run out of these things and had to get them from another floor. Although very cozy for one person, my room was indeed very small, although my parents' room was a nice size. As stated by others, the airconditioning was rather weak for what was a blistering heat wave. The room ACs are very weak, and this is one of those hotels in Barcelona where you have to put your room key in a slot in the room for the electricity to work. It didn't take so long for the room to cool off, but the AC must go off when you leave and take your key, so your room may be quite hot when you get back. Also, we asked to be placed on a non-smoking floor, and were given smoking rooms on a smoking floor (ash trays in both the rooms and in the halls). I'm not sure if there even was a non-smoking floor (we were told at check-in that there was), but the rooms didn't smell at all of smoke and we had no complaints or reason to ask to move. Still, the location was great, the hotel was impeccably clean, everyone was friendly, and the free internet computers a plus. My room, although tiny, was cozy and high tech, with piped in music (not working though!) and a flat screen TV. The included breakfast was fantastic. The hotel was a great value, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone. Although I had a few complaints, I have to realize 3 things: 1. This is Europe. If I wanted blasting AC and big rooms, I could have chosen an American hotel in Barcelona. But what's the point in going another country if you don't immerse yourself in all aspects of its culture? 2. This was a very busy month, and I think the staff just wasn't quite ready to handle the turnover. This is a brand new hotel and pretty new chain, but H10 as a company seems very efficient and dedicated to service, and I'm assuming they have a few bumps to work out. As an aside, we rolled in with 7 big bags, which the bell man carried up to our room by hand. When I asked the front desk if they had a bell cart, she told me it was on order and would be in in 2 weeks. So, like I said, seems like they're still working out a few kinks. 3. The week before, we had stayed at the Hotel Amabassador, just about 4 blocks to the south. The H10 was 100 Euros less per night, and about 2 full stars better.

Until arriving at the hotel, I did not realize that my travel agent had made the reservation for 1 person. Since we had not added the breakfast option, I didn't think this would be an issue, but the staff acted like I was trying to pull a fast one. Our pre cruise stay in the hotel was ok, other than climbing over our luggage in the small but nice room and being uncomfortable due to barely functioning air conditioning. Since the number of people had been an issue, I contacted my travel agent to change the post cruise reservation for 2 people to avoid issues on the next stay and hoping to get a larger room. Upon arrival at the hotel for our post cruise night, we were told that a water leak had flooded the 7th floor and we would be moved to another H10 Hotel. I was assured that the other property was equivalent to the Universitat including in room broadband internet access. Since another guest was checking in while we were talking to the manager and he seemed very tense and stressed about the situation, I had to question what was really going on. We were walked to the H10 Hotel Gravina several blocks away. It was ok, but the rooms were not as nice as the Universitat, no in room broadband access and the air conditioning was even worse than the Universitat. While reading reviews for the Gravina, I noticed that on two recent occasions they had experienced \"flooding\" also. What only seemed odd before, now appears to be a standard method for handling over booked situations at H10. I raised these issues with H10, but have not received any response.
