Rooms: clean, simple furniture including a large closet and a desk, conventional (non-flat-screen) TV, comfortable bed and linens. Large window with curtains. Bathroom small but totally fine. Only two towels were provided per person. Location: in Friedrichshain, a hip and somewhat alternative part of (former East) Berlin, with multiple bars, restaurants, delis (serving classic doner and currywurst), and even a bordello, all in easy walking distance. Short walk to the nearest subway stop, providing cheap and efficient transportation to all the major tourist sites. Service: Very friendly and helpful, front desk staffed 24/7. Free wifi in the room and in common areas. I did not try out the breakfast buffet since there are plenty of cheap alternative options in the neighborhood. In summary: This is not a luxury hotel. But if you are simply looking for an affordable, clean, comfortable and safe place to sleep, this is an excellent choice.", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sosnowiec", "Title": "\u201cFine place in peaceful surroundings\u201d", "Author": "DarioPi Posted by a CRC traveler", "ReviewID": "UR51230173", "Content": "Hotel is just fine. Close to the downtown and all important things in Berlin. Communication easy with U stations quite near. Service nice and polite. Breakfast just to eat your plenty before full day off. Cute mexican club-bar just around the corner. Room for three - space enough, beds - suited us fine. Parking - free places opposite the main entrance. We liked it.", "Date": "December 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington", "Title": "\u201cFriendly staff, good location - hidden bargain.\u201d", "Author": "chef2b", "ReviewID": "UR43347807", "Content": "This hotel, outside the Mitte, is a hidden bargain. Rooms are modest but very adequate. Free wi-fi in the rooms, too, which is above and beyond what a lot of hotels offer. It's two blocks from a subway stop, which makes getting into the center of town easy. It's not near many significant tourist sites, but is well located for dining. There are numerous restaurants and coffeeshops just a few blocks away, where you can get everything from great Thai food to classic schnitzel. The hotel's own breakfast buffet is great - eggs, hot meats, cold cuts, cheese, bread, cereal, etc. Some staff speak English, too, and will help with everything from directions to dining recommendations. The neighborhood doesn't look so great when you first get there - there is a lot of graffiti, for example. However, we didn't have any problems at all. The neighborhood is rather artsy, with lots of young adults. Downsides are: Smoking still is permitted in the hotel, so you could smell some residual smoke in the hallway There really isn't any room service or hotel restaurant. Also, there is a kindergarten nearby that can get noisy certain days (but only in the late morning-early afternoon). Finally, like many smaller hotels, there is no air-conditioning, so those visiting during the hot summer months might prefer another place.", "Date": "September 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Cruz, CA", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel in Hip Area\u201d", "Author": "Taster", "ReviewID": "UR2499064", "Content": "My daughter and I shared a twin room for 5 nights. It was rather small, but clean and comfortable. The only problem was that it faced the front street and was quite noisy, as taxi stand is below. The windows blocked the noise, but needed to be open, as it was hot. We asked for a room facing the back, which would have been nice, but they were full. Lovely hotel, generous breakfast, nice solarium/ garden area. Staff very friendly and helpful. We will return, and ask for a back room.", "Date": "August 28, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Gold Hotel am Wismarplatz", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d234879-Reviews-Gold_Hotel_am_Wismarplatz-Berlin.html", "Price": "$66 - $101*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Weserstrasse 24</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Friedrichshain</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10247</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "234879", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/f9/5a/f95abc41cc5342c747c792ad868355c92large.jpg"}}
