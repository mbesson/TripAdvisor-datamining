For starters, whilst it is a 5-10 minute car ride from Geylang, it is hardly located smack in the middle of the red-light district. It is conveniently located near a MRT station which made travelling into the city a very quick and painless experience.It IS very close to a night bazaar and hawker food centre - however these are typical of many suburban areas in Malaysia and Singapore and are not as seedy as some might think. It is possible to get a taste for simple, local cuisine nearby, which some people might welcome. I thought the food in the nearby area was far superior to that I experienced at the Newton Food Centre, by far the most well-known and most visited by tourists.The hotel is very tired looking as far as the rooms go and there were small irritances like the TV remote not working. The bathrooms were also in need of a revamp. On the plus side, there was a decent fridge and a new kettle. This is certainly not the place for a romantic getaway or a high-powered business executive. However, if you are desperate for a room (say around F1 weekend), I am sure there are far worse hotels in the Asia-Pacific region.", "Date": "Oct 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR552373406", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "cobra_awsom"}, {"Content": "Worst Hotel I've ever stayed in! Was unfortunate enough to spend 2 nights in this scar of a Hotel. The staff were very rude and Un-courteous (which is something I found at most places in Singapore) The room simply reeked of cigarettes! The bathroom looked well worn but looked clean. I skipped the meager breakfast offered with the room on both mornings. It was far away from anything. A member of our group had inadvertently shifted one of the seats in the lobby while waiting for our ride, just as she reached the door to leave she was rudely asked to move the seat back the few inches to its original location.

We needed somewhere reasonable that could cater my brother and his wife plus their 2 small children and 1 infant.We arrived at midnight. We didn't realise the hotel is in Geylang, a notorious red light district. The reception area is very smart but it ends there. We took the lift to our flloor and the corridor was minging to say least. No wallpaper, but writing on walls. Maybe being prepped for decorating. It also smelt fusty. My husband and I had superior room which was far from superior. It wasn't even clean, there were ring marks from drinks all over. The bed linen was okay but no other facilities available. Bathroom was mildewy and shower leaked so floor always wet. My brothers family had a room the same as ours with no beds for the 5 and 3 year old. After much complaining the reception staff brought 2 mattresses for the floor and they slept on those. Their room smelt of stale smoke despite my request for non smoking room.Fortunately I had printed off a copy of the reply from the hotel confirming my booking otherwise they would not have helped us at all. When I stood my ground and insisted on beds for the children the receptionist ran away.Avoid this pit at all costs.", "Date": "Apr 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR380560256", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "ZedhedzZ"}, {"Content": "Reasonable Rates But Not Much Else This is quite an old hotel located not too far from the airport but a little further from the main shopping areas.

Although the hotel is supposed to have had a makeover a few years ago, it seems that it might be just about due for another, more extensive one.

Receiptionist is extremely unfriendly, no smiling and no chioce of the breakfast.The main problem is, there are so noise in the morning (7:00) traffic sounds and the speaking of the room keeper so loudly, which let you get up very early. Its so distrub to the trip. Also we lost a T-shirl in the 2nd day, when we told the receptionist, they just ask us call house keeping by myself. When we call that, they just said will search on next day. On next day until we asked the founding, they have no answer and unwilling to help us search.

Many places to eat around.No safety issue when walking at night.Travelling By MRT- to Changi Airport takes 15 mins- to City Hall station takes 10 minsRoom----------------Got room #504. It is a definitely a very bad room: old, used and noisy.Asked for non-smoking room and got a one smelling cigaret!The carpet is old and used; At the entrance of the bathroom the carpet is always wet with moulds.The bath-tub is leaking, flooding the floor and making it slipping.The TV didn't work well: could only watch a few local channels.No in-room safe but a safe is available at the lobby.No mini-bar but a empty refrigerator is avalaible: I filled it with drinks  snacks at the 7 Eleven next to the hotel.The room was quite noisy because next to the elevator.Furthermore a thick door only separated my room and the one next to mine; I could hear everything in the other room, very annoying...Breakfast----------------Very few choices of meals and tasteless. Instead, go to a food court nearby for a tasty and inexpensive local breakfast.Staff----------------The staff is unfriendly and almost rude.At check-in: no hello, no smile, they just gave me my room key.Using the safe at the lobby: the staff member said safe key; you loose it you pay it, han!. Oh my god, He spoke to me if I were a 12 year old child!At check-out: no good bye, no smile, they just get the key.
