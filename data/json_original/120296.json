Immediately, they will overtly try to overcharge you. In addition, the woman at the counter during the evening shift was unpleasant, and her service was horrendous to say the least. She had absolutely no shame in renting a room with horribly stained walls, a lack of toiletries and supplies (literally, one extremely thin toilet tissue roll, one sliver of soap, and two threadbare bath towels), and all the room doors on the front side of this \"Inn\" looked as though they have been kicked in regularly! A horrible and possibly dangerous place. When and if there are better rooms available, why would an \"Innkeeper\" choose to rent these rooms to anyone? Which begs another question, why would anyone want to stay at this facility now that they have learned this? If you want to be near attractions, do not stay here. You will not be close to the theme parks. This property is located at the opposite end of the city NEXT to where the attractions are located. Kissimmee is full of great deals for hotels. Keep looking. As a local who knows the area, do not stay here, or on this end of Kissimmee at all.", "Date": "October 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay in Kissimmee\u201d", "Author": "RPicard", "ReviewID": "UR112588982", "Content": "We have stayed there more than 5 separate times in the past 20 years.

The Flamingo Inn is a clean and quiet place to stay, and it is within easy walking distance from a convenience store/gas station, a major pharmacy as well as many other shops. Eventhough it is not a recent construction, the grounds and the building are always well maintained and clean. Also, we love the smaller size pool that is great for all ages and swimming abilities.

They have a sign out front with a low nightly and weekly rate and it has attracted homeless people who now live at this hotel. I have nothing against homeless men but when they keep me up half the night and they stand on the balcony drinking, smoking and looking at my teenage daughter i get a bit upset. I made reservations and asked for a non smoking room for me and one for my friends family, they gave me a smoking room that smelled so bad i couldnt sleep. My friends room was not ready so they told her it would be ready in 10 minutes, after they lady came back down stairs she says there is a man in there who is not checking out, so they give her some small room with a bad smell, snot /mucus on the walls that was never cleaned up and there was only top bed covers, no under blankets on the bed. Nothing matched. For the price we didnt expect much but it was so unbarable that we told him we wanted to leave and he told us he would charge us one nights stay just to cancel, we didnt want to pay the extra fee since he messed up our rooms and reservations but he wouldnt back down, so we paid the fee and we left and found an econo-lodge down the street that was 10 times better.
