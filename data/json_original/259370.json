Nothing terrible, but the furniture and decor were quite tired * The shower's pretty weedy; again, not a huge deal * Room service restricted to just a few hours each evening * The noise. Others have mentioned this, but the noise insulation is poor. I stayed on the top floor and could hear doors closing and toilets flushing downstairs. It wasn't as bad as some hotels, but if you're super-sensitive to noise, take earplugs!

We've been here in January 2009 and really liked the hotel. At that time there were only a few visitors and our general impression was very good. Over the last 1,5 years we've stayed in more than 15 hotels all over Europe and ... maybe we got spoiled a bit. Maybe our standards got up a bit... When we arrived last week our first contact with the reception lady was fantastic. She was very friendly and even spoke a few words of Duch. But when we arrived in the junior suite we were a little bit dissapointed. The furniture was old, a sofa with a few stains, some humidity-stains on the wall (in the corner). The bathroom was really outdated and the biggest problem: you can hear all your neighbours (when they walk around, when they use the shower or toillet, when they open a door, even when they move a chair). You definetely need earplugs to get some sleep here. The next morning the noice pollution started round 6 AM ... I have to say the 2nd and 3th night the hotel was much more quiet ... so maybe our 1st-night-neighbours were to blaim. The breakfast is sober, but really tasty and very clean. The breakfast lady is so friendly and nice. The hotel offers free laptops, printers, umbrellas, etc... Each day somebody comes to your room with the weather forecast for the next day. After a 3-night stay our review is: maybe 1 star too much because it is a bit outdated and rather noicy, but this hotel has a very helpful and friendly staff. Because of this staff we might consider coming back to this hotel on our next visit to amazing Barcelona.", "Date": "September 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Frankfurt", "Title": "\u201cBest service I have ever had\u201d", "Author": "FQL_Travel", "ReviewID": "UR70364571", "Content": "Hotel Rekord is a very small hotel with just 17 rooms spread over 6 floors.

She also gave us laptop computers to use in both rooms. Our two teenage daughter immediately went on the internet to catch up on the past 10 days. The rooms were big, very modern and clean. Although the mattresses were abit thin we were quite comfortable. The hotel is in a quiet neighborhood in/near the business district. The service here is top notch.

We were after a 'boutique style' hotel in Barcelona in an area that didn't have the constant hustle and bustle of 'La Rambla' or the 'Gothic Quarter' and we certainly chose well. The location of this hotel is perfect if you want to stay somewhere that is a little quieter and isn't surrounded by tourist-trap bars and restaurants. It's not a hotel for lads or ladies on a party weekend as it's a little out of the way for access to hip entertainment areas such as 'el ravel' and 'el born'. The hotel is about 50 metres from the Muntaner FGC station which is only 3 stops from Placa Catalunya (it takes no more than 10 mins to get there). The Aerobus operates from Placa Catalunya which is a very cheap and convenient way to get to and from the airport. We found the FGC and Metro to be very efficient and easy to use (we always make a point of using the subway / metro / undergound systems wherever we travel so we are well used to reading the maps and making changeovers to get to our location). Francesc Macia Square is a 5 min walk from the hotel and you can catch the Bus Turistic here for both Northern and Southern routes. We would recommend the Bus Turistic as the best way to see the many sights and attractions Barcelona has to offer. Passeig de Gracia is about a 15 or 20 min walk away if you fancy a stroll in the sun rather than going underground on the FGC. We booked our hotel through the hotel website. Check-in was efficient and staff were always courteous. We knew very little Spanish or Catalan but this wasn't an issue as staff had an excellent grasp of English which made things a lot easier for us. The hotel lobby is very stylish yet small. There is only 1 lift to take guests to their room although this is adequate given the hotel's size and the fact there are only has 2 rooms per floor. We stayed in room 502 which was a 'Junior Suite' which was made up of a living area, bedroom and ensuite bathroom. The room was stylishly decorated in modern colours and felt every bit a 4 star hotel room. The room was immaculately clean and felt very spacious and airy. The complimentary 'plate of fruit' was very nice and the bathrobes and slippers set for each guest are little extra's that make you feel more than just another number through the door. The living area had a TV as did the bedroom. We didn't watch much TV at all (we never do when away) and although the selection of channels seemed fairly decent there was only 1 channel broadcasting in English (CNN). The room had a cabled internet connection and an eletronic safe both of which were very handy to have. My only gripe with the room was the bed which looked so inviting yet i never really had a comfortable night's sleep in it. It was harder than i'm used to and the pillows were a bit too soft and flimsy. Breakfast was included in our room rate and was excellent. The breakfast room is small yet comfortable and the selection and quality of food on offer was really good. It was a buffet style breakfast with all of the usual fruit, bread, cereals and cold meats on offer. There were also some hot food items available (eggs, sausages and bacon) although we didn't try these. There is an adjoining TV / reading area which is very cosy and offers complimentary tea/ coffee and biscuits etc from 6pm every evening. Both areas had wireless internet connections which i used without any difficulty. There were several restaurants in the area although we only visited 1 which was an Italian restaurant directly across the road (we fancied a change from all the tapas we were eating). We had to queue for some time even though we had made a reservation so it seems to be very popular with the locals. The food was very good and if you like Italian food you could do a whole lot worse than eat here. We also found a few places in the area selling lovely pastries and cakes if you have a sweet tooth. All in all, we had a great time in Barcelona and our stay at Hotel Rekord was everything we were after and more.", "Date": "April 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barcelona, Spain", "Title": "\u201cExcellent small hotel in perfect position\u201d", "Author": "Poussis", "ReviewID": "UR12851812", "Content": "Stayed 2 nights this January.

Also unusual for Europe were the coffee/tea-making facilities in each room. Breakfast was a vast buffet - enough to challenge the biggest appetites. You can also use the lounge area during the day and help yourself to tea, coffee and cakes up to 9 at night. On our first night, staff brought a plate of fresh sliced tropical fruit to the room. Good area too - Muntaner is a lively upmarket street, well connected to all parts of the city but away from the touristy bustle of the Ramblas area.

The only disappointment was a check out, because the girl on reception couldn't really speak English or any other language. So we have soent the first 10 minutes explaining her, which address should be written on the invoice, and the next 10 minutes waiting for the invoice. The waiting was in vain, because the girl couldn't print it because of some problems with the printer, so we just payed and left without invoice, bacause we were in a hurry for the airport.

Room 402 was at the back of the hotel so it was quieter but the hotel is in such a quiet neighbourhood that even though 201 was streetside it was still relatively quiet. Room 402 was a suite.
