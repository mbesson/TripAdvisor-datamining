I asked where the elevator was and the surly black desk clerk said \" sorry, no elevator\" (he didn't look sorry.) He also said there were no other rooms.

Other than that, it was clean - no bugs, and it didn't smell \"smoky\" however it wasn't designated as non-smoking. The remote for the TV didn't work - oh well, at least the TV worked. The A/C worked, hair dryer, microwave, and iron worked. The bathroom and bathtub were clean looking, but the strips on the bathtub were old and worn. I took a shower - it was okay. There were people swimming in the pool, they looked like they were enjoying themselves. There is a Walgreens nearby, also several fast food restaurants. You can walk 2 blocks east and look at the water. Bus service is good, however there is no place good to walk at night. If you want both night life and day life, the best place to stay is South Beach. I only stayed at the Midtown to be near the Hilton where my family reunion was.

First impressions were good, the facility seemed good for the value, the location was convenient, the room size was large. The rooms were basic and could use a good cleaning as they had kind of a musty smell and the carpets were dark and dank. The bathtubs are pretty dingy so we opted to shower the kids. The fridge was not working on arrival however it was promptly fixed after we called. The staff were friendly and accomodating. I went to use the coin laundry facilities however the washer would not work so I went to the front desk and he assisted me in using the hotel's industrial machines which was greatly appreciated. The continental breakfast was basic but did the trick (2 varieties of cereal, muffins, bagels, donuts, pastry). Would have like to have use of a toaster for the bagels and perhaps some toast. Rooms were cleaned daily and they even made up our youngest son's playpen the one day which I thought was cute. We were in a unit that was facing the road so it was pretty noisy and there was road construction taking place. The disappointing moment came at the end of our stay. I went to wake my son up in the morning on our last day and when I flipped back the sheets there were several bed bugs (large and small crawling around). On further investigation I noticed that there was a lot of excrement in both the beds and smears of blood towards the bottom where our feet would have been. Needless to say we were quite disgusted and happy to be leaving!! I just hope that we managed to avoid bringing any home with us!! I realize that the climate plays a big role in these issues and that even the most luxury of hotels can have these problems but clearly these bugs had been living there for quite some time and were well established.

The toilet bowl and sink never stopped running. The pillows probably were many years old. The air conditioner was icy cold but so loud you couldn't hear the T.V. I couldn't change my room because the hotel was full. The other couples had similar complaints with their rooms including a broken leg on one bed, collapsed mattress on another bed, curtains that didn't close fully for privacy, etc. We all experienced the inablilty to get fresh towels until after 5P.M. on both nights (because the hotel washing machine was broken). A total of 5 lounge chairs were around the pool for the booked-full hotel guests to use. Complaints to the front desk (in person) were unanswered. We were stuck there for 2 nights awaiting our cruise ship. Returning from my cruise vacation, I wrote to Super 8 corporation as well as the hotel directly. To date, I've received no replies. We paid about $90.00/night. I realize Super 8 is not on top of the hotel chains, but this property comes close to violating some local ordinances and/or health codes. My advice is to go for the extra bucks and stay at a better hotel in Miami.", "Date": "December 6, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Midtown Inn Miami", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34438-d235516-Reviews-Midtown_Inn_Miami-Miami_Florida.html", "Price": "$76 - $1,118*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">3400 Biscayne Blvd</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Miami</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">FL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">33137</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "235516", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/ff/29/ff2992f74308012fe9530629e5b8a1dc4large.jpg"}}
