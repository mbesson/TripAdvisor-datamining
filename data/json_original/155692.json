It's basically a dump for locals from provinces, and not suited for international travelers. Our room was small, old, basic, and was even cleaned when we arrived at 2.30 p.m. It faced a courtyard (nothing you want to go out to), and we were bothered by people talking into late at night. Bedding looked clean but was old. I was so miserable that I used free Internet (the only good thing about this hotel) in the middle of the night to book a room at Hilton Reforma, only a few blocks away and only $50 more (weekend rate). but was so so much better. The room was clean, spacious with a view, and the bed was very very comfortable. Pool was great, and service was superb. What a difference! The lesson I learned is when in Mexico City, don't try to skimp of a few bucks on hotel and go for internationally recognized names -- and avoid \"Centro Historico.\" It's crowded, noisy and dirty, and most buildings are very old and not very well maintained. On top of that, the street in front of Tulip was being dug up for repaving, and was so dusty.", "Date": "August 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "irvine", "Title": "\u201cTulip Inn Ritz...

A few meters down the road is my favorite ice cream shop...they sell the best ice cream.When I needed my caffeine fix, I just cross the street where I can have a steaming hot cup of coffee plus freshly baked pastries. The room is really spacious and clean. What needs to be improved though is: I was there for 3days and in 3 days, breakfast food is the same. : ( I was not able to sleep well because the bed is kinda hard and the pillows are not that fluffy.", "Date": "August 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palm Springs, Ca", "Title": "\u201cCozy hotel in Mexico City\u201d", "Author": "PalmSprings21", "ReviewID": "UR73654920", "Content": "This hotel is located in the heart of the historic district.

As Europeans we are not so fond of building block hotels were every room is the same. Knowing that this hotel dates from 1930 we were very pleasantly surprised with most of the rooms. The situation in the heart of the historical centre of Mexico City means that you can visit everything in a short walk. The reception on the first floor is well staffed and there is free and unlimited internet access for the guests. The breakfast is superbly presented and attended. The Madero street is noisy, but most of the rooms are around a little inside terrace tucked away in the building. In full summer heat the rooms maybe a little hot because they are only equipped with a fan, but we enjoyed in this period a nice climate. If the hotel is not fully booked you can always asked to see the rooms and eventually choose the one you like most. We also went to other big hotels on the Reforma boulevard and were very happy to be in our small scale, personal service Hotel where a guest is no number. When we returned for our second stay at the end of our trip the nice people at reception even remembered the telephone number we asked them to call during our first stay. Please try this in a modern hotel ? So in conclusion : highly recommendable because of the location, because of the small scale, beacuse of the good breakfast and beacuse of the nostalgic interior. If you cannot do without airconditioning, withour perfect english, without 50 channels on your tv then you still should go for the good reasons.", "Date": "April 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "lake chapala, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cgood value, good location\u201d", "Author": "gringolandia", "ReviewID": "UR10027489", "Content": "We booked three rooms...some were nicer than others...but all were charged the same rate.

Then we wanted to go to the Busstation south with an Volkwagen Taxi (my girlfriend has never been driven with an old Volkswagen). Your Hotelservice decided that we have to use your SAFE Taxis which will cost 120Pesos. At the Busstation your SAFE taxidriver charged us 140Pesos. I just had a hundred and a 50 Pesos note and the Tasxidriver told us that he is not able to change. After 5 minutes discussion with your SAFE taxidriver that we are not going to give him a tip on his not agreed Price he suddenly found coins in his taxidoor. This ist not the way we are making deals. I will never recommend a hotel to somebody if this is the understanding of service to guests you think you will never see then again. best regards Mussehl PS: 3 collegues of mine are waiting for my notes of the trip.
