It is a little out of the city, but we took a leisurely walk to San Giovanni Square in 10mins and to the Coliseum from there in 15mins. Alternatively, there is a bus stop outside the hotel and a taxi costs around 10 euros. The hotel surroundings are not the prettiest, but we didn't need to go around that area much in our stay. Our favourite part of the hotel was the spa bath, which was heavenly following a full day site-seeing around Rome. Also, we paid extra for breakfast on the last day and it was well worth the 12 euros \u2013 we ate around 4 courses of food! All the hotel staff we came across spoke very good English.

All in all we were treated so well that we did not feel llike just another customer/guest. We did not eat at the hotel only for breakfast once and it was not something to write home about. For breakfast you are better going across the street to the cafe in the corner and having a delicious pastry and capuccino which was very cheap. It was very convinient having the bus stop right in front of the hotel. We took the bus everywhere and getting to the center of Rome took only approx 20 minutes or less at times. Also the via del pigneto area right behind the hotel was great. Small market vendors outside during the day and at night great local restaurants and bars. The atmosphere was great so was the food and the price. Plus being with the locals and away from all the tourist was a good change at night after being in the center all day. I would def stay here again and recommend this hotel to my friends and family. We are so glad we decided on this location. Was there for two weeks and it really felt like home. I read reveiws before about the noise from the metro but we did not hear anything. Our room faced another direction so I am guessing that is why but even in other areas of the hotel we did not hear much noise from trains and/or traffic.

The room itself, was a decent size, very comfortable and very clean. The bathroom was an excellent size and about the only (very minor) problem we had with it was that the shower leaked a little onto the floor since the shower doors didn't seal properly. In terms of location, you need to be prepared to use the public buses or take taxis to the city centre. We almost always used the bus and were in the city centre in less than half an hour. Similarily, the Coliseum was about a 20 minute bus ride away. If you don't want to use public buses, a taxi ride each way would be in the neighbourhood of about 10 Euros, so the money you'd save on the hotel would be spent on taxis (in which case it would make more sense to stay in a hotel in the city centre). We found the bus and subway system fairly easy to use (just buy a day pass from any tabbaco store) and hop on and hop off as often as you want. The hotel staff provided us with a map of the area and labled it with the bus routes for us. We were also able to book several excursions through the hotel (i.e., the Vatican, Naples & Pompeii). The breakfast at the hotel was was awesome - cereals, toast, bacon, eggs, cold cuts, coffee, tea, juice, etc. It was more than enough to keep us going until dinner time. We didn't care for the food at the hotel restaurant at dinner very much, but right around the corner from the hotel, there is an alley that, at night time, comes alive with restaurants and bars.

The staff were very friendly and helpful - we asked for a couple of restaurant recommendations - one of which (a restaurant called Mr Manzo's, a 5 minute walk from the hotel) was excellent. Couldn't comment on the hotel restaurant as we didn't use it. The one downside was that it is a little far from the centre of Rome - although there is a bus that takes you directly to the Colosseum, to access the other parts of the city you need to take a bus to Termini, and then take another bus or metro to your intended destination. Travelling back from Trastavere, the main eating/drinking district, after a meal proved very tricky - and we eventually succumbed and spent 20 Euros on a taxi to get us back to the hotel. A welcome surprise was the road behind the hotel - a road called Via del Pigneto. This road is full of little bars and a couple of restaurants - they are full of locals (we barely saw any tourists) and the area felt a lot more authentic than a lot of the tourist traps that we found in the centre - additionally everything was more reasonably priced. I'd certainly recommend this road to young couples/travellers as it was great fun spending some time down there. It felt safe too, to us anyway. Would I recommend the hotel to friends? Yes - OK travelling into town each day is a little onerous, but Via del Pigneto really was an unexpected bonus. Would I recommend it to my parents?

To save time and money we took the express train from the airport - a big mistake. It is not nanywhere near the central station. true - there is about 2-3km only between them, but you have to take a bus or a street car to get there and buses are always always packed in Rome. When you already made it to the hotel it is great. rooms are small but very nicely designed to have everything you need. equipped with all amenities - Small flat TV, Mini bar, jacuzzi, hardwood floors, all perfectly cleaned and brand new. free wi-fi, and phone calls are charged the exact cost. staff had been very helpful, with lots of information about the city and the neighbourhood. My advice - take a taxi from the airport (40-45EU) - it costs the same like the train (the express is 14EU each,& children 50%) and you will get where you want same on the way back. When already there and no luggage - you can take bus, street car or taxi, all are very easy to get to. Walking to the main atttraction or the central bus station is not an option.

(although this seemed to be the norm for many places in Rome. Coffee on the other hand was a lot cheaper). Likewise we were charged to use their laundry service and reception claimed they did not loan out irons to customers. 3) Location was in a very dodgy area of town far from the main train station Termini and all the major sights. To get to the hotel from the main train station requires a bus journey of around 30 mins. When we returned late one night to the main station we were advised by station staff not to take a bus into the area at that time due to it's poor reputation for crime.", "Date": "May 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Derby, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExellent choice for a weekend visit to Rome\u201d", "Author": "Mikeboy1", "ReviewID": "UR105039447", "Content": "An excellent welcome awaits you as you arrive at reception.

The staff members vary, the girl checking us in was a bit patronising and did not tell us that the city tax would be payable in cash only (we were only advised of this on check-out). In the morning, it\u2019s hard to ask staff for anything as they are swamped by people and there\u2019s not enough staff members around.

Anyway, they can get the item ironed for you for 3 Euros per item I think, which is a bit cheeky but we said okay. We also wanted to get something printed, which they said they could do, just email it to them (great we thought). But a particular staff member seemed not capable of finding an attachment to an email.

I would definitely stay at this hotel again. The Hotel; Very modern hotel, it's apparent it's used frequently by people on business due to the high standard and finish of the hotel. The Rooms; The room we had was a double room with a balcony and the balcony was twice the size of our room, huge! If you choose to book this hotel send an e-mail to the reception desk (address can be found on their website) and put in a request for a double with a balcony! It can't be guaranteed but you may as well give it a go as we did and were given a lovely room.) The room itself had a lovely king size comfortable bed with a sofa at the end of it. Lots of space to walk around in, the bathroom was of high quality, although the bath (a jacuzzi bath) was on the small side for a larger guy like me but i usually shower anyway so not a big deal! Location; It's not central Rome however you are literally about 10 mins bus ride away from everything,once you get used to using the public transportation in Rome it really isn't difficult to navigate your way around, the bus top is literally across the road or down the road to your left depending which direction you wish to travel so that made getting the bus really easy. Directly behind the hotel where our balcony is located you look down upon a street where you can find a supermarket, bar, cafe, food etc so if you didn't want to spend your money on the mini bar you could go to the supermarket and get yourself some food and drinks from there at really cheap prices! Staff; The staff were most helpful and friendly, room service cleaned our rooms ever when we were late leaving in the day, the receptionist gave us a map upon arrival listed all the bus routes we should take and gave us loads of helpful information. When we used the mini bar they would call up to the room to see if we would like it restocked with anything in particular. There was only one downfall which was when my other half requested to have her top cleaned and ironed and ticked the \"Delivered Next Day\" option and it was not returned the following day. We spoke to reception who apologised however where this isn't done in the hotel we had to wait to the following day, not a big deal but listening to my partner go on and on for 24 hours about her top is a big deal to me! All in all if you can get this hotel at a good price and it's much cheaper than the ones in central don't worry about the location you will be fine it's not that far out at all and this hotel is worth it's money. If you do find a modern upmarket hotel in central and it is cheaper than this hotel then you may as well go for that because if you can get more central it is handy however a lot of the hotels in central are very outdated and tired so be sure to read your reviews and look at some pictures and keep this hotel in mind because i thought it was great.", "Date": "March 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wales", "Title": "\u201cGrand Prix\u201d", "Author": "raymondoWales", "ReviewID": "UR98489836", "Content": "This hotel is situated a 5-10 Min bus ride out side of Rome and can be easily reached on the 105 bus which takes you to the termini for 1 Euro.

Staff are friendly and most speak some sort of English to help the cause.Rooms were cleaned daily and fresh towels etc. were all changed on a daily basis also hotel breakfasts can be purchased there if you don't want to book them on-line, as we found it was cheaper to buy breakfast at 12 Euro per day rather than pay 25 Euro cost if booked as part of your holiday Now the not so negative but points: Could have done with a tea or coffee making facility in the room. Nothing beats a brew when you get up and your head feels if it has had 10 gallons of beer (which i think some of us had) Some of the rooms mine was A108, face the corner junction of the road and my room overlooked the main road.

Excellent room furniture. The bathroom (one of the most important items in my personal judgement for a hotel room) was IMPECCABLE. Immaculate Jacuzzi available. Truly excellent. Breakfast buffet is exceeding any expectation, especially after considering the very limited breakfast choice that you have in so many hotels in Rome. Hotel located a little far from the center, you have to take a bus, taxi or a metropolitam train to reach the traditional touristic areas, but still in a busy neighborod (you have pizzerias and restaurants at walking distance). Only downside, my room was on the street side where the railway is. the train is quite noise from early morning to around midnight. probably the rooms on the other sides do not have this problem.

Our room also had no blanket but they were quick to bring us a brand new one when we asked. The hotel felt like it was more aimed at business clientele rather than tourists. The location was ok, a little out of the centre, but there was a bus stop and a yellow tram line (to Termini) out front. Both came regularly so transport towards the sights of old Rome was not really very difficult (although a lot slower than if you stayed more centrally).
