Upon check in, we thought of their good deeds by upgrading our room from family room to suite but we found out the we were given room 501, very old room, dusty, big spaces yes, furniture are old, curtains are dirty , carpets are retiring, staying there for 1 hour, my kids suffer asthma attacks and allergy already. we demanded a new room but we were given a room night time already, we transferred to 8th floor, we though everything will be ok, the room is so so ,but still not clean, dusty , and there is a smell which we dont know where coming from, so we stayed there for almost 3 nights but we were wondering why my kids keeps on coughing and having stuffy nose especially whenever the aircondition is turned on. Again, we discovered that they have transferred us to smoking floor , I did not know why these stupid people transfered me to a smoking room since my primary reason is allergies and dust besides, i have requested first hand that a non smoking room for us, also it is also logical since we have 2 kids around, cant really imagine what they have done. I demanded again for transfer, they transfered us to non smoking floor, though the room is still the same but a little improvement in the carpets, but the air surrounding the floor and airconditioned is have improve so much than before. I ask them, why the front desk have transfered us to a smoking room, as usual they cannot provide a straight answer. Internet acces also is very expensive, you need to buy a wifi card which you can use continously only which i think is not reasonable. Food is not ok also the breakfast is not good. One good points here is only the good location but the rest is dissapointing. Also, i remember that bed covers and bed sheeets have blood stains.

The interiors need some sprucing up because it is rather loud with too much going on (gold chinese lettering, a loud fountain etc.) The rooms were OK. The lobby area had a funny smell which was probably emitting from the \"Rickshaw coffee shop\" where a lot of Chinese/Singaporean food was prepared (sesame oil?). We were pleasantly surprised that the breakfast was very tasty although the presentation was mediocre. The parata and pancakes were delicious though the bacon was overdone both days. The best was when they prepared sweet and sour prawns and rice at around 11.30 in the night after a long day of sight seeing. The reception has its moments, with one attendant being very helpful while one or two attendees being too preoccupied or ignoring us until we got their attention. Also one attendant refused to take ownership when we got locked out of the room since we missed the check out time. I had to go back twice to make sure the locking card/key worked since she bungled it up the first time. Overall, the Rickshaw restaurant was a good start to a day and a quick snack but I recommend eating out like most of the city folk do.

We asked for a non-smoking room, and upon entering it, we could tell that people have chained smoked in there before - it reeked. The room just had an old, smelly & dirty feel to it. The beds in the room (which was 2 twin beds) should've been chucked out a long time ago. The mattress was so thin, we literally had springs poking though our backs. We had to pile up all the linens we could find on top of one bed, to provide some cushion & my husband & I slept on 1 twin bed. Bathroom was ok, working, which was a good sign for us.

In case the security is taken by way of blockage of SGD200 from Shopping Cards, it should promptly be unblocked on departure and clearance by the visitors. 3.

I had been looking forward to the Singapore leg of our trip for so long and we booked this hotel as it was cheaper than others on offer. It wasn't cheap enough! Where do I begin? The furniture in the room was dusty, the carpet had big lumps of fluff on it, the shower was warm and worked ok but the shower head and rail were rusty and in need of replacement. The TV was a modern flat screen and worked fine, but this was the most modern thing in the room. The bed was hard but we both slept alright...probably out of tiredness more than anything rather than the quality of the bed. The sheets and brown scratchy blanket were off putting. The main concern in the bedroom must have been the air con - it was actually dripping water out of it! Not good, although I'm ashamed to say we didn't report this at the time. One night we were so hungry we ordered room service - a cheese sandwich and fries. It was brought to the room within 15 minutes of ordering and wasn't too bad...plus it was cheap.
