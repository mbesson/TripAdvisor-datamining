I did not consistently have access to a car during my stay, a car would make have mad my stay even better. The hotel is new so the rooms were consistantly in good condition as well as the common areas. I thought the food here was good. Breakfast was included for me ( free for gold or higher with Hilton honors). Had cook to order omelets, fruit, breads, eggs, yogurt etc. Dinner is decent and works in a pinch. I tend to like the places across the street though as I just like to get out for dinner if possible. The van transportation was good, I heard they would take you to a grocery store a couple of mile from the hotel but I never tried. They did have good transportation to the airport and the sim/training facilities nearby. The hotel grounds and pool area were well cared for. They have a pool and Jaccuzi. The business center is a decent size and in good order. 2 computers, and a great full size printer/copier. Not the small size most places make do with. The hotel wifi was decent, but did slow down in the evening. For diner I tried several of the restaurants across the street. Directly across 36th is a Denny's and a Wendy's. Didn't go in either but guessing they are ok. In the shopping center next to the Wendy's is a fantastic Cuban place (back left corner). Inexpensive and large meals, that are very tasty. If you have never tried Cuban food GO THERE,and get the Masas de Purco ( fried pork chunks), tastes awesome and you will have enough for a second meal. I also tried the Peruvian place and the Colombian place. Both are good too. The Peruvian place is a bit more pricey, but the food was good. The Colombian place was good, the dining room is a bit small, but the prices were great and the food good. Both of those are on the right side first floor. There is also an Argentinian restaurant but I did not try it. If you make a left on 36th and go under the express way, there are 2 more good Cuban places, one on each side at the next light. El Tropico on the left side in the shopping center, and the Lating American grill on the right side. Also an Italian place and a sandwich shop on the left. Down just a little further on 36th is a Burger King and a Johnny Corino's on the left. If you like cigars there is a good shop in the shopping center across the street from the hotel. It is on the second floor. They have a good selection, reasonable prices and the people that work there were very knowledgable.

The only reason four stars is 1) No porter available to help with luggage. 2) No safe in room 3) Failure to give booked morning alarm call. BUT the good points:- Bedroom was clean, amazingly restful bed, well fitted out and it smelt clean. The efficiency area within the room was also convenient and unobtrusive comprising of microwave, fridge and coffee maker. The food one could buy, within the hotel, for own use was not expensively priced. The amazing thing - the sound proofing. It was only when I went for a stroll outside that I realised that the flights into Miami Airport passed directly over the hotel. I videoed one of the evening flights as my room was on the seventh floor directly under the flight path because my friends will never believe how close the planes come but HOW QUIET it was in the room. I did not hear any noise louder than my A/c and fridge whilst in the room. I also used the gym in the hotel and whilst small compared with some other hotels it was well equipped and clean and stayed open until late. The printer in the business centre did not work, when I tried, but the helpful staff at reception rather than having me wait for a repair to be effected invited me to use their reception printer and computer without any problem. All in all a very enjoyable evening's stay whilst waiting my flight out of MIA....and breakfast was an all you can eat type and I recall about $11...good value. Complimentary airport shuttle is every 45 mins and on time. As I started by saying I have no hesitation in returning to Miami Garden Inn, Miami Airport West when the next opportunity arises.

The hotel is fairly new, I'd say it's about 2-3 years old as it looked and even smelled quite fresh. The decor was very modern and contemporary throughout the hotel. The entire front desk staff, from morning to afternoon to evening were all quite friendly and accommodating. But I have to say though when they get busy, they get slammed hard yet they remain calm and pleasant. The room I stayed in was nicely furnished and was pretty spacious. It featured the same amenities you'd expect from every Hilton Garden Inn, such as the adjustable bed, which is so awesome and comfortable, complimentary high speed internet, microwave, mini-fridge, coffee maker and 32\" LCD TV. The bathroom however had a stand in shower, where the standing area was the size of a tub so you can literally fit two people in there. The showerhead however was placed rather high and for as tall as I am, I had a hard time adjusting the settings. My only complaint about the room was that the closet was very small, it had two sliding doors so the opening was barely big enough for me to fit my (carry on sized) suitcase in without scuffing the wall. Also, the room I was in faced the industrial area with a view of the airport so, I also experienced quite a bit of the flight path noise, which was pretty much from 7am sharp to about 11pm. A colleague of mine who stayed there too was facing the parking lot and said that she didn't hear the planes. Their restaurants offerings were blah, it was the epitome of hotel food. You know, overpriced and under flavored food. But, since there aren't any restaurants withing walking distance it was either Mc Donald's/Denny's or the hotel...I choose the hotel. The evening restaurant staff could use a bit of attitude improvement. They weren't rude at all, they just could've been a little more attentive and warm & fuzzy. The hotel gets a lot of the leisure travelers that are either staying prior/post cruise, which I learned the hard way as I was hoping to catch their shuttle to the airport but a family was catching it and they had more luggage and oversized souvenirs than people. I told the front desk agent to call a cab for me because there wasn't any room, which she did and told me that they'd pay for it due to the inconvenience. Way to go! I didn't mind paying for it but, that was customer service deluxe in the act! Overall, this hotel was great.

She made real positive impression of the hotel and the Miami. Room was spacious and the whole property was clean and fresh. It is right next to another Hilton brand hotel Homewood Suites and whole property is semi gated and has plenty of free parking. Price of hotel breakfast is about twelve dollars but is well worth it. My children enjoyed heated, clean, spacious swimming pool. Location is what you might expect from a near airport hotel and the area reflects that. Which means nowhere scenic or serene.

The place had not lost its new hotel smell. The service was pretty good. My only request \u00e2\u20ac\u201d for a Miami Herald \u00e2\u20ac\u201d was not met, but the guy at the front desk went above and beyond what I'd expect for him to track one down, calling across the street to the gas station, which had already sold out their copies (I settled for a complimentary USA Today). I did use the business center to print out my plane ticket, and the PCs in there were nice. I had no trouble printing out the ticket. Internet service in the room presented no trouble for my Mac laptop. The rooms were very nice and clean. The TV screens were large, new plasmas. The bathroom was very clean. The bed, apparently adjustable, was plenty comfortable, though I didn't tinker with the settings. The food in the downstairs restaurant was maybe a little expensive but what you'd expect at a Hilton. I had breakfast the morning I checked out and was satisfied with the quality. While the hotel is quite close to the airport, it's near the end opposite of the airport's entrance so give yourself at least 15 minutes even without traffic. The location is apparently sketchy, and there's two entrances. The back entrance is closed at night, I found out. When I called over to the front desk, they said they began locking the back gate a week before after some break-ins, though, to their credit, they had a security vehicle manned all night, it seemed.", "Date": "January 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palo Alto, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Suites\u201d", "Author": "DiscoveryTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR23645160", "Content": "Lots of space with the suites.

Breakfast in the morning was very good, with excellent service. We had breakfast included in our rate of $137 per night for 2 adults, 2 children. Hotel is a little further away from the airport than other hotels such as the Embassy Suites, but only by about 5-10 mins. Not many restaurants in the immediate area other than fast food. As there is freeway access right outside the entrance to the hotel, we chose an italian restaurant Buca Di Beppo for dinner. It is about 15 min. North on the freeway.
