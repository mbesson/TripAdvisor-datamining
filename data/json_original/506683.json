Its location is very nice, only a few meters from shops, the famous Venetian bridge and public transport in and out the city, but once in the hotel we were very disapointed. There weren't any curtains, so by night when you put on thel ight in your room, the people in the room on the other side of the hotel, only 1 meter away from your wall, can enjoy the view of you. It also looks like the hotel has to save on its costs cause every time we leave our heating was turned off by the hotel staff and it was very chilli in our deluxe room. This deluxe room was also located on a very deluxe place in the hotel , on the first floor between the stairs to the reception and the stairs to the breakfastroom and the kitchen. .This way at 7 am you wake up with the sound of hotelstaff that prepares the small breakfast in the basement without any atmosphere, doing the diches and cleaning the hallway. When we complained about the nose that waked me up this early in my vacation, there wasn't any response to make the inconvenience stop or to recompensate it. I wonder for what this hotel has recieved three stars. We stayed one night in a hotel with four stars in the center of the city and it was a world of difference. I'd rather pay some more than to go back to this wripe off", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cLoved it.\u201d", "Author": "holidaysometimer", "ReviewID": "UR122783436", "Content": "Great location, very handy and easy walk from station!

On arrival the member of staff who checked us in was friendly enough and was happy to provide information on restaurants etc, when asked. The room was very small with about 1 foot of space around the bed. The only amenities were air conditioning (not used) and a small television as well as a phone in the room. The room was clean however our biggest disappointment was how noisy it was at night and in the mornings. The stone floors, thin doors and windows meant that any returning guests would make enough noise to wake us up. In addition, from 7 in the morning the staff preparing breakfast could be heard throughout the hotel and was sufficient to wake even the deepest sleepers. All this on top of the hard mattresses meant that getting a good nights sleep was a challenge. Breakfast was a disappointment, a very basic continental breakfast with a limited choice; a few yoghurts, a couple of slices of ham and cheese per table and a bread roll. However, considering the location of the hotel, the price was very good and we would recommend to other travellers visiting Venice to stay in Venice itself as it adds greatly to the experience. It is important to note that the hotel is down a dark alleyway just off the main street. Whilst we never encountered any problems and felt safe throughout our stay, this may put off other tourists. Most of the rooms in the hotel are upstairs and there is no lift. Wi-fi is available for an additional (expensive) charge.", "Date": "November 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location in Venice, easy to find\u201d", "Author": "Rossie_9", "ReviewID": "UR119842101", "Content": "We stayed for 4 nights. This hotel was selected for it's location (close to the train station), and ease of access - it did not require the use of a boat to get to our accommodation. The location is great, and we found all we wanted within a few minutes - canals, transport, shops, restaurants. At the time we stayed, work was being done out the front to repair the pipes in the narrow laneway down which the hotel was located, but this did not cause any real inconvenience, apart from making it a bit loud when people dragged their trolley bags along it - my room faced this). The room was of reasonable size, clean, with good lighting. A safe in the room would have been nice. The bed was comfortable, and there were lots of TV stations to watch on the TV, but none in English - not a real issue, but needs to be mentioned. The decor was simple venetian style. No bath, just a good shower.

The attitude of the staff to my complaint amounted to a shrug of the shoulders which underlined their negative attitude. Arriving 4 minutes early for breakfast one day I was ushered away and scolded for being too early but not before seeing a half naked member of staff setting up the tables.

The hotel entrance is down a narrow alley-way about a hundred yards off the main walkway so it's a bit unaccessable for luggage.

The access to our room was through a little shabby courtyard, which also communicated with the alley at the back of the building. Strange activities went on in this courtyard at night, and we were kept awake until the early hours by misterious noises just outside our door. We thought these could relate to staff doing the laundry using a sort of machine which was in a cupboard in the courtyard. Neverthless, it would have been a weird thing to do at 1 am in front of the guest bedroom. Furthermore, there was a locked door in our room, which appeared to communicate with a toilet of another bedroom or a pubblic hotel toilet. People could be heard going in and out of the toilet all night. In one instance, somebody was clearly heard vomiting. After a poor night sleep, the poor breakfast did not certainly cheer us up. In addition to all this, the two members of staff that we met on the night of our arrival were quite unfriendly. Overall, we would not recomand this hotel, neither we would come back.
