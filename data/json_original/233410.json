However it has an excellent location, we walked everywhere apart from the Vatican, which was 9 euros from the taxi rank virtually opposite the hotel, the hotel was very clean with very helpfull friendly staff. Breakfast had a limited choice, but had excellent coffee, fruit juice and pastries. The only minus point that bothered me was that the shower was quite cramped, but all in all I'd recommend this hotel, we stayed 3 nights and I'm glad we booked the San Silvestro. There was a little noise from the road outside the hotel, but what do you expect if you stay in the centre of Rome? There were many bars/restaurants close to the hotel at a reasonable price, I'd recommend the nearby Pizza Ciro in Via della Mercede, don't be fooled by the name, it's a lot more than a pizza restaurant, and frequented by locals which says a lot. The hotel is also ideally situated for shopping.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Antwerpen", "Title": "\u201cgood location\u201d", "Author": "Erica D", "ReviewID": "UR126553639", "Content": "Small but good hotel.

You are exactly in the middle and walking distance of all the attractions in Rome. There is a large bus depot right outside the hotel for easy commuting...but, the hotel itself is ugly. It's dated and old. Perhaps it seemed this terrible to us because we had just come off of staying in the most wonderful hotels in Tuscany and Sorrento for the same about of money or less. After the shock of this hotel wore off, we realized that we should make the best of it and we weren't gonna be in the room that much anyway. The ease of walking to the Trevi fountain and the Spanish steps made up for the other short comings of this hotel. The breakfast was also disappointing (mainly because of our experiences with the other hotels). The breakfast consists of coffee, tea, bread, triangle cheese spreads, butter and jam. Nothing fresh or exciting. We searched the neighborhood for a better hotel for the same money but didn't find anything or we would have moved very quickly! Also, be prepared that in Rome, there is no such thing as free internet. To sum this up, don't expect much and you won't be disappointed.

Yes, the rooms are small, but who goes to Rome to spend lots of time in their hotel rooms?!?! There was a man at the front desk, Marko, who was, by far, the nicest person at a hotel I've ever met.

He also helped me immensely trying to figure out the confusing bus schedule. I have never encountered someone as friendly as he was. The hotel is so central that you absolutely must stay here when you visit Rome. It's just off San Silvestro square. From here, you can easily get a bus to Termini or Tiburtina stations, and from there, your options are countless. You're just minutes, by foot, from the Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain. If you don't have much luggage, you can easily catch a bus to San Silvestro square from Termini or Tiburtina (it's the last stop on the 71 bus). You'll save yourself lots of money vs. taking a taxi!

Upon opening the door to my room I came across a wall, in fact this wall was the extent of the room. Entering I noted I could touch three walls at the same time and could almost touch the forth.
