The kind that likes to say hello to my neighbours and greet other hotel guests in the corridor. That is why the round table seating at Hotel Lancelot appealed to me so much. My husband and I visited in September 2008 (I had to click Sept 2011 due to TA choices) as part of our Italian honeymoon tour. You might think it ood that newlyweds would be drawn to this shared table experience but why wouldn't we; we still love talking to and meeting new people no matter what. And we met some fantastic people night after night and laughed and drank the inclusive wine; such fun. I wasn't over the moon with the first room* so feeling a little deflated on honeymoon, my husband enquired about being moved. This was done quickly and without question. The second room was far more fitting and decorated in a Wedgewood shade of blue. The staff are attentive; the food is beautiful and well worth the half board option (or opt in each night as we did). The location isn't in the centre of everything but is very close to the Colosseum, easy for access to buses and I've no problem walking in a city this wonderful. *Looking back, there wasn't a problem with the first room, I think I was just a little spoilt from the huge suite we had just shared in Positano.", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cFriendly and helpful staff and great location\u201d", "Author": "PiscesV", "ReviewID": "UR128222254", "Content": "I cannot say enough good things about the Hotel Lancelot and their staff.

The same family have run the business since 1971 and it shows in the way that they care for the hotel and their customers. The secret of their success is that they have mastered the mostly forgotten art of keeping things simple and doing them well. The whole place is run with quiet efficiency; the staff stay in the background but are there and very helpful whenever you need them. You are genuinely made to feel like a welcome guest. The hotel\u2019s website has plenty of useful information and we got the best deal by booking directly with them. Their response to enquiries was prompt and helpful. We booked a standard room and this was quite spacious, simply furnished but with a large comfortable bed. It faced on to the street but there was very little noise from the quiet road, except for the daily refuse truck which appeared noisily every morning between 8 and 8.30. It\u2019s true that the bathroom was small (one at a time only) but like the rest of the hotel it worked well and was spotlessly clean. There is free wi-fi but if you don\u2019t want to bring your own stuff there is also a free internet room. For us the best feature was the evening meals, and the hotel policy of encouraging guests to gather at the round tables. If there was a spare seat a member of the family might join also. The meals themselves were of very good quality and included wine, coffee and a liqueur if you wished. This was a very pleasant way to round off the day, sharing conversation and tips about visiting the sights with fellow guests. The staff always managed this in such a way that language was no problem (If you book dinner for three nights or more, there is a worthwhile discount.) The location is close to the Colosseum and the Forum, but a little further from the other main attractions. If you want to wander Rome\u2019s lively streets after dark you might not want to set out again after dinner, so it\u2019s best to have one or more days as B&B and eat in the town. For character and authentic Roman food at a reasonable price we liked L\u2019Antica Birreria Peroni (it\u2019s in the Trip Advisor restaurant reviews). Although close to the Trevi Fountain it seems to cater much more for locals than tourists, and is well worth checking out. Two things we found out as first timers in Rome:- There are lots of uneven and cobbled surfaces - take your most comfortable walking shoes. Also, take great care when stepping off the pavement - the traffic treats every set of lights like a Formula 1 starting grid and can come at you from unexpected directions. It\u2019s fine if you stick to the proper crossing places, but jaywalking is not recommended. We would definitely stay at the Lancelot on any future visit to Rome and can recommend it highly to everyone else for its welcoming atmosphere, good food and company, and its quiet but handy location.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cWill never stay anywhere else in Rome\u201d", "Author": "Gatorfly", "ReviewID": "UR127656111", "Content": "Fantastic hotel and staff! We just arrived back in the states after a Easter weekend stay in Rome. Initially I had made reservations at an American chain hotel outside the city but after reading many reviews decided it would be better to stay closer in. By the time I added up all the extras I would pay for daily transportation, extra breakfast for my young sons, and internet, it really ended up being a wash money wise so I elected to stay as close to the city sights as I could. I had read great reviews of Hotel Lancelot but was a little apprehensive since the price was so good. Boy were those feelings wrong as we ended up having the best stay I could have imagined there! As many others have so eloquently stated, even though the location of this hotel is steps away from The Colosseum and The Roman Forum, what really makes this hotel special is the staff! Always helpful, always courteous, always smiling and doing everything they can to make your stay in Rome memorable. From the moment we stepped through the door we had everyone making us feel welcome and at home. Tips on everything from local places with the best pizza to how to avoid the long lines for the sights were plentiful and offered with a smile. The room itself was fine and for a family with 2 young kids who went sight seeing all day was exactly what we needed. Having free WiFi so readily available in all common areas as well as your room was great, as was the breakfast every morning with fresh breads, meats, cheeses, cereals, yogurts, coffee and cakes. With so many great places to eat in Rome, we elected to only eat at the round table for dinner on Easter Sunday. It was an experience that we will never forget and was the perfect ending to our visit there. Four gourmet courses topped off with ice cream swans all served perfectly in a festive and fun atmosphere. When we go back to the Lancelot, we will definitely eat there more often, if not every night. To sum it up, if you are going to Rome, and don't stay at Hotel Lancelot, you will be missing out on a wonderful experience all in itself.", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reykjavik", "Title": "\u201cMy Roman home away from home\u201d", "Author": "Gestur_Traustason", "ReviewID": "UR127495555", "Content": "This won\u2018t be a traditional review and I won\u2019t make the slightest claim to be unbiased\u2026 Rome hosts the global HQ for the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). As a child in the late 70's I spent weeks in Rome while my father was at meetings at FAO regarding new postings or reporting on completed tasks. We would always stay at Hotel Lancelot and the hotel would normally have its fair share of FAO expats on their way home or on their way to new assignments all over the world. My brother and I explored Rome from the age of 6 to 16 and always considered Hotel Lancelot to be our Roman home more than a \u201chotel\u201d. Didn\u2019t do that image any damage that the staff more or less remained the same, we would meet old friends and everything was on an extremely friendly first-name basis. About 25 years after my last stay in Rome I decided to take my wife on an anniversary trip to Rome and the Lancelot. I was a bit worried when we arrived. After all my recollections were through the eyes of a child and it had been nearly a quarter of a century from my last visit. Since that time I have done a lot of traveling and am used to all levels and grades of hotels so I wondered how Hotel Lancelot would compare. Let me assure you it completely met my expectations. The rooms aren\u2019t huge but they are above average. Certainly bigger than typical London or Paris business class rooms. Certainly smaller than rooms tend to be in the USA. Beds were comfortable, extra pillows and blankets available. The bathrooms are clean and have everything required but nothing luxurious or big. I had no issues with cleanliness, noise, heat or any other item regarding the room. They beat hands down rooms in comparable hotels in London and Paris in regards to furnishing, cleanliness and comfort. The lobby area was very clean and pleasant. There is a small bar to one side that proved an excellent place for a pre-dinner drink or a post-dinner chat. The staff was extremely helpful and informative. We got directions, suggestions, maps, information and even an umbrella for a rainy day. The elevator is special\u2026 Possibly the smallest one I\u2019ve ever been in. We put our bags in it, pressed the third floor and took the steps. Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the elevator is hindering the hotel from the extra star they deserve. I doubt you will ever get a hotel that is central to everything in Rome. To me the key issue in Rome is having a hotel that\u2019s conveniently located regarding transportation. If all roads lead to Rome then all roads and busses in Rome lead to the Coliseum. With the Hotel Lancelot situated so close by and armed with the info and maps from the lobby we started and ended our excursions with a bus-trip. Quick, cheap, convenient and offered a bonus sight-seeing tour. There are plenty of cafes and restaurants in the area around the Coliseum so going out to dine isn\u2019t hard. However I strongly encourage you to experience the Round Tables and the full board at the Lancelot. You go to Rome to see all the historic sites. So you are up and about early in the morning and out walking and looking all day. Back at the hotel around six and personally I didn\u2019t really look forwards to going out again to find a restaurant. So for us the full-board option was great. Just go to the dining area, sit down at one of the large round tables and see what table partners you get. We always met interesting people and we would share tips and ideas for the next day of sight-seeing. Got the address of the best ice-cream shop in Rome (owned by a former Swedish pro-football player), a tip to save time in the queue at St. Peters, heard a new story about one site and a warning about another being closed for repairs. The food was quite good and typical Italian. Sometimes great, sometimes just OK. Never bad. The wine offered won\u2019t get any prizes but it was appropriate and plentiful. If I didn\u2019t have the past connection with Hotel Lancelot then would I recommend it? No doubt. In fact I have already told several friends that have gone to Rome to stay there. None of them have complained. I for one am definately coming back.

The menu seemed well selected although less inspired by local cuisine than what we'd have hoped (but I guess you can pick one of the neighboring restaurants for \"trippa\" and \"abbacchio\"..). Ambiance of the dining area was pleasant. The hotel is located in a quiet neighborhood with plenty of restaurants and a handful of shops, including a small but well furnished wine seller. We felt very safe at any time, for example walking back alone to the hotel at one in the morning. As a matter of fact, we found downtown Rome to be very safe.", "Date": "January 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cCharming, family run hotel\u201d", "Author": "Chita44", "ReviewID": "UR123034374", "Content": "Charming tastefully decorated hotel in an elegant house built in 1942; has front garden and 6th floor terrace with Colosseum views.

Its a 5-10 walk from the Colosseum and the adjacent Colosseo metro station. Located on a quiet side street (47 Capo D'Africa) with a quaint little courtyard, the hotel really makes you feel like you're in Rome. We had initially booked a single room (erroneously) and the hotel quite willingly accommodated our request to switch to a double. The room was quite large (on the 4th floor) and had a nice window which opened up onto the street. The bed was comfortable (a bit hard but that seems to be the case all over Rome). In any case, we slept very well. There was no street noise (none that we noticed anyway), so we left the window open for most of the time that we were in the room (the weather was cool and comfortable in November). The bathroom is a bit small but the pristine cleanliness more than makes up for it (we would prefer a clean bathroom over a large bathroom any day). Like most hotels in Rome, there is no carpeting on the floor, which has wooden parquet flooring. This adds to the charm and authenticity of the hotel. The heater was a bit noisy, so we ended up switching it after the first night since it otherwise kept us awake. The customer service is outstanding at the Hotel Lancelot. The folks at the front desk were super helpful and always cheerful. My wife has a gluten-free diet restriction and once we informed the hotel, they made sure that she always had gluten-free alternatives available at the morning breakfast (which, by the way, is superb - salmon, cheese, croissants, sweet rolls, excellent coffee, the list goes on). Each time we asked reception for a taxi, we only had to wait 3-5 minutes (although this seems to be the case everywhere in the old city in Rome). The hotel reception was accommodating in other ways as well, happily checking city restaurants for gluten-free menus and giving us directions and other tourist information whenever we asked. The hotel has free WiFi Internet but we couldn't access it in our room. However, we were able to connect quite easily in the corridor outside our room. Our friend who stayed on the third floor had no problems connecting from her room so it may just have been an issue with our particular room. Not a problem anyway, since they also have an Internet workstation in the lobby which guests can use for three euros per hour (we used it for 15 minutes and were only charged one euro). This seems to be a hotel which thrives on repeat business. Many of the other guests seemed to have stayed here in the past, which says something for the place since it isn't the cheapest hotel in Rome (quite average in terms of price). Our room had a safe which we used to store our valuables, although this doesn't appear to be the kind of hotel where you would have problems anyway. The hotel has been run by the same family for decades and they seem to have made it a point to keep their customers happy. Certainly, we would stay here again. Location wise, its walking distance to many of the Roman ruins (Colosseum, Palantine Hill, Forum, Circus Maximus, etc.). One night, while walking back to the hotel after dinner, we stopped and watched a fireworks display celebrating a saint's birthday at the Basilica of San Clemens, which is just a couple of blocks from the hotel. We stayed here for three nights and then moved to a hotel near the Spanish Steps, not because there was anything wrong with the hotel, but because we wanted to spend a few days near the Steps and also because we got a good deal at a hotel there (significantly cheaper). Overall, there are cheaper hotels in Rome which are also in nice locations. However, we didn't find the warmth and authenticity anywhere else and left this hotel with fond memories. One caveat - the restaurants around the hotel can be a bit pricey and are clearly targeted towards tourists. Since they're so close to the Colosseum, they focus more on the view rather than the food. We typically ate dinner at other locations around Rome (which allowed us to get a flavor of the city). The one night when we had dinner at a restaurant next to the Colosseum, the food was quite good but definitely not worth the exorbitant price (six euros for a Coke) That said, we would definitely recommend this place, particularly if you want to really \"feel\" that you're staying in Rome.", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bedfordshire", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel, very friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "Dayvaux", "ReviewID": "UR120903514", "Content": "A quiet location (so quiet the taxi driver had not heard of it)., handy for the Colosseum.

It was a special occasion, one of the reasons being my daughter's 21st birthday and my niece's first trip overseas. We stayed in rooms 60 , which is the corner suite and 61 which was the next room. Both of these have a lovely view from the terrace, the suite having a view of the Colosseum and Parco di Traiano and at night one could see all the way up to St. Peter's. We arrived early evening after a very long series of flights and immediately welcomed by the receptionist and by Mrs. Khan . Everyone was very helpful in getting us settled and explaining how things worked at the hotel. Our rooms were comfortable - the suite was spacious and the double room was small , as most rooms are in Rome. The bathrooms were well appointed, the suite having a bath tub. The mattress in room 61 was new and too firm for the girls but the linens were of very good quality. Both rooms had TV, free wi fi and spacious storage for belongings. The breakfasts were buffet style and there was a wide selection of foods ranging from breads, cheeses, meats, fruit , juices, tea and coffee. If one wants a cappuccino or other than straight american coffee one only needs to ask at reception or to one of the staff . Each night dinner is served at the hotel either in the enclosed patio area or breakfast room. The menu is offered at the reception desk and at breakfast . If you do not chose dinner included in your room rate you only have to let them know by 4pm that you wish to join for dinner- which is served at 7:30pm. The food is prepared by Mrs. Khan's son who is marvelous and very interesting to talk with also. We very much enjoyed our one meal there. There is also an extensive bar offering a selection of standard drinks plus liquors unique to Italy. There is a lift if one wishes to use it but I chose to walk the 6 flights each time which is how I could justify eating so well each day . A truly special thing they do at the hotel is serve something special if it is a celebration, like a birthday . On the evening of my daughter's birthday before we went out to dinner they brought up to the rooms drinks in which the glasses had been decorated with colored sugar and Happy B-day and my daughter's name was written on one of the glasses. It was such a sweet little special touch that really emphasized how personal the hotel is and how Mrs Khan and her family feel about the business they have. The only draw back was in my daughter and niece's view and that was that the location was too far away for them to just go out at night and wander the hang out areas, like Campo di Fiori and Piazza Navona. As I am a big walker I did not find the location a problem and actually enjoyed staying in a totally \"new\" area .

I had never been to Rome, so with hundreds of Hotels scattered around the city, it was a gamble choosing somewhere. I needed to visit the Vatican and Colloseum, so rather than risk somewhere in between, I chose to stay near the Colloseum due to the rather more peaceful surroundings that appeared to be around there. Trip Advisor rated this Hotel as within its Top 20 Hotels, but it was one of the cheapest - sub 200 Euros - in that Top 20. The rest were 400+ Euros. Ideally I wanted to pay 120 Euro for a Hotel for one night, but these all appeared to have indifferent reviews and locations, so I decided to pay the extra for the reassurance. It was worth it. The pictures on the Net and the actual Website of the Hotel don't do it justice, and the impression I got before arriving was of some posh version of 'Faulty Towers' run in a B&B style with quirky Courtyards, Terraces and strange staff going overboard to please. This wasn't the case. The Hotel is just a regular Hotel, in a city, with friendly staff - but not overbearing friendly if that makes sense - and helpful receptionists. It is not a crappy Travelodge or PremierInn affair, as us Brits know. The clientele on my night was almost all American, and this was the night of the Rome demonstrations and small scale riots. We could see the burning cars from our windows, with black, choking smoke pervading the terrace. We felt safe inside the hotel and ventured out later in the eveing. We found a few lovely, cheap Pizza / Pasta restaurants within one block walk, with meals from 7 Euros, all with dining areas and Gas burners on the pavement - a typical lovely Mediterranean feel with cars drifting by behind us (not burning thankfully). Go two blocks further to the Colloseum and the price for food doubles - so avoid.! It aint worth the view of the Colloseum for the extra cash. Stay withing two blocks of the Hotel for good local dining. There is nothing for at least 1/2 a mile in any other direction if you want other food. You'd have to walk in the direction of the main Banking area / Trevi fountain for more food or different variety. If you're there for more than 1 night, then do both. The Hotel placed us on the 6th floor which had a view of the Colloseum, which was an added bonus. You could even see the ancient structure whilst on the toilet seat through the bathroom window.! Result. The only complaint is that a bottle of 660ml beer from their bar - no draft beer - is 6 Euro. But to be fair, the Irish pub one block away was the same price for a pint so I guess Italy is just expensive for drink. 90% the residents of the Hotel were English speaking, mostly Sceptics, but they were all genuinely very friendly and we all shared a good laugh about the riots and the hooliganism of the demonstration - but then again we're British and from London so know all about bloody riots.?! In summary, the price of the hotel is steep but worth the extra, the location is peaceful (ish - riots permitting), great for walking everywhere, and the Colloseum is just jaw dropping to look at from the Hotel. The Hotel was ever so clean, the bathroom small but who cares, the staff nice, the safety and security faultless, so all in all, highly recommended. The hotel will tell you it'll take 50 minutes to walk to the Vatican - I'd say nearly double that.! But what a picturesque walk it was and apart from the blisters, I'd do it again and again. Believe what you read here on Trip Advisor, it is the place to stay, you'll have no regrets, and if anxious about believeing what you read, if you do not know Rome, then trust me, just book it.

In every 3 star hotel we stayed in during our European Adventure there was a clock or clock radio.

The dinner appears great value at 25 Euros per person but there are no choices and that can make a meal you've booked before arriving a bit hit or miss.

However, the brief time we did spend in the hotel revealed it to be clean, well-appointed and very welcoming. The bedroom was spacious enough for one and would have been fine for two. It was adequately furnished with a good-sized wardrobe and a comfy bed. The bathroom was clean, a fair size and the towels were generous too. The tiled floor would be very cooling in summer and came in very handy during our trip as it rained so much that any carpet would have become sodden right through from raincoats, shoes and umbrellas dripping. The breakfast was a very generous buffet of pastries, breads, cheese, ham, cereals and fruit. The coffee was excellent! The bar was very welcoming (and also very tolerant of a load of frazzled mature students in need of a pick-me-up). The location is superb: very close to the colisseum and some super restaurants and yet on a quiet, residential street - still accessible to taxis and mini-buses though, which is not always the case in Rome.

Breakfast is a decent continental affair. Missing a little variety and the odd boiled egg, but generally it's a good start to the day. The round tables are a nice way to interact, something we Brits aren't always accustomed to but it certainly adds a little flavour to the proceedings.

The rooms are clean but tiny, especially the bathroom. You could basically sit on the toilet, wash your hands and have a shower all at the same time. For the price I expected more, but maybe this is the Rome standard. I haven't been at other hotels in Rome to judge. Someone in the previous review mentioned that her husband couldn't fit in the shower cabin and I laughed - what an exaggeration! Well, when I saw it with my own eyes, I knew the woman was not kidding. I am a size 6(US)/40(EU) girl and I had to be very careful in there not to bump my elbows against the walls when taking a shower! The breakfast was OK, nothing special. The location was good, but it is a little bit out of the way from the main attractions other than the Colloseum and the Roman Forum. In the mornings I would take a bus to wherever I needed to go, because time was of the essence but I would usually walk back in the evening. I think it took maybe an hour or a little bit more to walk from most touristy places. The staff is helpful in letting you know which bus to take and you can buy a bus ticket at the reception. The view was to the inside courtyard in my room, and this is the same for most room, from what I could surmise. What came as a surprise to me is that there are no facilities for Ironing at this hotel. You have to pay a laundry service to do it for you and the prices are not small, either. I don't remember exactly. I think it was something like 3 Euro for a shirt. And then you have to give your stuff for ironing no later than 6 pm or something and, of course, they are closed on weekends. Ridiculous. I found out later that ironing is a problem in Italian hotels generally. Apparently having irons in rooms is prohibited by law, but in all other hotels I stayed at in other Italian cities, the hotels allowed you to do the ironing yourself for free at a designated \"ironing room\". In some, they even brought the iron and the ironing board to the room, so I think Hotel Lancelot could also arrange at least something, if they wanted to. As for noise - I could hear everything that was going on in the hall like it was happening in my room, so if neighbors were noisily returning - I heard all of it. Usually not much noise was coming from the courtyard. I could also hear water running in the next door room", "Date": "August 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Uppsala, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cI loved the terrace!\u201d", "Author": "Daniel R", "ReviewID": "UR116636873", "Content": "Very friendly staff and a goof location.

My husband and I booked a five night stay at the Hotel Lancelot in Rome through a booking agency on line. I won't mention the agency unless the issue is not favorably resolved. When we arrived at the hotel through a lovely lush green gated courtyard we were informed that we had no reservation in spite of our printed confirmation in hand. Well, It turned out that the agency admittedly in err booked us into the Hotel Lancelot in Spain not Rome. There was no availability with the Lancelot in Rome or elsewhere in the city because of a big convention. We spent hours on the Lancelot's phone to the booking agency and all around Rome. The really phenomenal element of this story is the Khan family and their staff. They supported us throughout the whole emotional search process and Mrs. Khan, in a quiet but in control way, shuffled something around and provided us a beautiful double deluxe room with a stunning terrace for that evening. Refreshed the next morning, we spent even more frustrating hours in the hotel's well appointed lobby with bags in tow until the Khan daughter miraculously located an absolutely incredible leasable nearby apartment for us. They even allowed us a very substantial breakfast with them in the mornings. They could have turned us away and said it was none of their concern but they showed incredible compassion to two travelers in need from Dallas, Texas. We will never forget them and highly recommend their hotel. It is beautiful, clean and well run. It\u2019s always good to find that a property lives up to its description of itself.

We picked up hints and tips that saved us time and money as well as having a wonderful evening. Do book the Vatican tour online. DONT JOIN THE QUEUE FOR ST PETERS IF YOU HAVE TICKETS FOR THE VATICAN A policeman told us to as he said everyone had to for a security check. YOU DONT. If you have already got your tickets online walk thru the city wall and up to the entrance to the museum. Our ticket was for 11.30 but they let us in at 10.15 and we went right to the front of the queue. The lines are crazy. I must repeat, do get your ticket online. We did ours the night before from the hotel. Once in the Cistine chapel leave by a door to the left NOT right. this will take you into St Peters and save more lines. Do go to the Colosseum early, dont bother with the audio guides take Rick Steve's book instead. Do buy the 48 hour pass on the 101 open top bus to get around. Do take a map, YOU WILL GET LOST.

Nothing super special, but probably better than many hotels in Rome and Italy where the quality is generally poor, so expectations are low. In North America, this hotel would be at best 3 very, very average stars. But as I said, when in Rome... this is pretty good. Pro's: 1. Location: Well sort of. If you want to visit the Colosseum and Forum, this is a good location. But it is a bit remote in the sense that you are not going to go out to the street and join the locals in an evening walk - the neighborhood is pretty dead and it is a ways to the \"heart\" of Rome. That said, the metro is a 10 minute walk away, and a taxi stand is 5 minutes away. There are some restaurants in the area too. Like 90% of restaurants in Italy, the food is fine, but never, ever good or great. 2. Room 60: This \"suite\" is located on the top floor and overlooks the rooftops with a clear view to the Colosseum. Beautiful. The terrace itself is cute in a simple, rustic and somewhat untended way. Too bad there is no room service option as it would be a great place for breakfast or dinner! That said, the room is expensive and the decor... well see below. 3. Service: Some people are drooling about the service here. Not our experience. Nothing bad, but nothing overwhelming. \"Pleasantly neutral\" is how I would describe it. 4. Breakfast: Decent enough - most all people should come away satisfied, although the coffee and tea would make any Italian and Englishman, respectively, cry from the poor quality. Con's: 1. Location: See above. 2. Rooms and decor: The hotel decor looks like something from a 1970's museum, something you would find at your old Italian aunt's place in Anytown, Italy. Or a set from a Fellini film. Like the vast majority of hotels in Italy, the Lancelot does not invest in capital refurbishments. Cracks, stains, mold, windows don't quite close, rusty patio furniture and the like abound. Why does this seem so prevalent in Italy? Economics 101: supply and demand - little of the former and a lot of the latter! Too bad - it leaves a bad taste. Some people have commented on the Internet - I think it works fine, even if it is pretty unique to set up. Overall: A relatively decent option for Rome.

The location is super, a few blocks from The Coliseum. Very convenient, not only for visiting the Coliseum and the adjoining Forum and museums, but because at any major bus stop in central Rome there is a bus or two that includes \"Colosseo\" among its stops -- making it easy to get home.

Arrived New Years day & booked on half board basis in case other restaurants were shut. Suprised to find that diner was strictly 7.30pm and the restaurant had around 6 or 7 tables seating 7 people. There was a fixed menu with no choice and you were expected to share with other residents, which was a new experience for us, fine except you sometimes just want to dine on your own. Food was fairly basic and my wife couldn't eat anything as stringy lamb was served preceded by undercooked sausage & polenta and followed by a seriously frozen baked alaska. As my wife rarely eats red meat, I had to eat hers to avoid embarrasment. Wine was served with the meal which was far better quality than the food and plentiful. We chose after the 1st evening to revert to B&B and had fantastic meals out at everywhere we ate for lunch & dinner. Breakfast was OK although eggs and a toaster would have been a nice option, which we generally find elsewhere in Europe, just the basic cereal, fruit, bread, small packet cheese and a plate of ham (if you are quick enough). I asked if more ham was possible when we arrived for breakfast at 9.00am but were told it was finnished.

Looking to the right, fortified convent, straight ahead across the rooftops Trajan's baths, and to the left, the Colosseum. It was absolutely magical. The continental breakfast was plentiful and always had a wide selection. The family-run nature of this hotel makes you feel as though you are stepping back in time, to an era when politeness and grace was the most important element of hospitality. The only small criticism is there is no mini-fridge in the room, and with the heat we kept water & juice and pop in our room and we wanted to keep it cool.

We stayed on the 6th floor in a room without a terrace, but with access to the terrace at the end of the hall and a direct view of the Coliseum (four blocks away) from our room. Staff speaks better English than I do; they are friendly, warm and as noted in other reviews, very helpful in working up your itinerary in Rome. They suggested ordering our visits to attractions in ways that almost eliminated waiting in lines. Quiet residential neighborhood appeared to be safe throughout our 4-day stay. Small discount off the price if you have the Rick Steves guide to Rome. It was so incredible staying so close to the Coliseum, Palatine Hill, etc. While I recommend getting a \"Roma Pass\" for free admission to two of your most expensive attractions, and free metro (which we didn't use) and bus rides (which we did extensively), make sure you visit two expensive venues first as the first two are free and you almost get the full cost back from those two. Subsequent attractions (not everything participates, like the Vatican museum) give only a discount. Hotel convenient to many bus routes and only cost 10 euro for a cab from main train station to hotel (Only use a white, metered cab!!!), including baggage and tip. Fixed price for cabs to FCO airport is 40 euro. The desk will call a proper cab, but the funny thing was that our cab had its seatbelts disabled and the driver hit over 150 km/hr on the way to airport with maximum speed limits of 100 km/hr. Translates to 93-94 mph. Certainly not the fault of the hotel. Also be aware that the driver may drop you at Terminal 3 and many international airlines fly out of Terminal 5. A free shuttle will take you from T3 to T5. They offer a delicious dinner at extra cost. We loved the one we had, but ate out in neighborhood restaurants the other three nights when we only wanted to eat lightly. You can prepay for dinner with your room, or pay a higher amount for dinner on an ad hoc basis.

I am a frequent business traveler who is traveling more often than not. I am accustom to staying in nice hotel chains like the Westin, Sheraton, Marriott, etc. In order to write this review I need to change my typical expectations from a large US hotel chain to a small boutique hotel in Rome. Location (3.5 stars): This is a quaint little hotel located within a five minute walk of the colosseum. The location is quiet which is something you'll come to appreciate in a city that does not sleep. You'll find plenty of restaurants and bars within a couple of blocks although the better places are closer to Trevi Fountain, Pantheon, or Spanish Steps. Just to give you an idea it's a 30 minute walk to Trevi Fountain and other attractions. A cab will run you approximately 10 Euros to Trevi Fountain and perhaps a little more to the Spanish Steps, Vatican, etc. There is a bus line within an easy walk although it's a little too crowded at times (which is to say you might be fine with it). If I could do it all over again I might give more consideration to being closer to the Spanish Steps or Trevi Fountain, but then again the miles and miles of walking is a good way to burn off those Italian meals. Value (3 stars): I found the hotel to be priced in the middle of the road for central Rome, but it's unfortunate the US Dollar has fallen so much versus the Euro. The typical room rate is 186 Euros which converts to $280 USD which makes this hotel a poor value for Americans. Room Size (3 stars): The room is a typical size for Europe which is my way of politely saying it's small (approx. 200 sq ft). The bathroom was even smaller with no bathtub and a shower similar in size to what you see on cruise ships. I understand some rooms did have a bathtub and a slightly larger bathroom. Beds (2 stars): We had two twin beds and I know the other option is a double. The beds are very hard which I believe is a European preference. The pillows are also hard, but I did find soft pillows in the armoire. TV (1 star): I have stayed at a few other European hotels and I know it's unlikely to find a large plasma TV in Europe. However, I was a little disappointed to come back to the room after a long day to what amounted to a 14 inch TV. The only channels in English are CNN and BBC. I think some people will say the TV is not a concern since they are there to sleep. Other: The room does not have a clock so don't forget your travel clock. Also be aware when you request a wake-up call the staff may not call you on-time. Breakfast (3 stars): Like most hotels in Europe there is a continental breakfast included with your stay. The breakfast consists of cereals, meats, croissants, coffee, and juice. The breakfast was fine and in line with expectations although I did get bored of the same exact thing every morning. Dinner (4 stars): We did try the hotel dinner one evening and we were pleasantly surprised. It might be a good idea on your first night to go with their dinner option for 25 Euros per person and it includes everything including wine. Cleanliness (5 stars): This hotel is well maintained and very clean. Our room was always kept clean and the maids were friendly. Staff (5 stars): You will not find a better hotel staff in Rome. Everyone who we spoke to at the front desk was friendly and went out of their way to accommodate us.

Our terrace was filled with fragrant flowers and had a table with chairs and a beautiful mosaic bench. With the terrace, our room was about as far from a cookie cutter hotel as one could imagine. It provided a great spot for reading, relaxing, sipping wine and enjoying the salads, cheeses and other foods we picked up at the supermarket we passed each day on our walk to the Colosseum station, which is about a ten minute walk from the hotel. The common areas of the hotel were very welcoming. I spent part of an afternoon watching guests come and go while reading in the lounge area, which is filled with overstuffed furniture and antiques. There is a charming outdoor patio near the bar for those who don't have a balcony or terrace to enjoy. Finally, the staff members we talked with were eager to help and very friendly, and there was always someone at the front desk who spoke English or understood my fractured Italian. We felt like the staff genuinely wanted us to have a wonderful time in Rome and cared about the service provided each guest. We got some good restaurant and tour recommendations from the staff and purchased our bus/train tickets at the front desk, which saved time at the station. I made use of the hotel's guest internet service several times, and it was very reliable. We did not attend one of the hotel's nightly dinner services, but I heard guests say how much they enjoyed the meal. Breakfast, served at round tables shared with other guests, was adequate--cold cereals, breads, cold meats, fruit and juice. We used the hotel's car service to get to the airport, which appeared to be much better value than taking a taxi.

They stopped and waved from the end of the road and we had to walk down to meet them - not a problem in any way but worth bearing in mind if you are being picked up independantly.

We arrived quite late the first night and booked the limo (a BMW 7-series with every mod-con) through the hotel. We were greeted by an elderly Italian gent, who was really friendly and gave us a nice commentary about monuments as we came into Rome. On arrival at the hotel they were extremely friendly. This was the case with all the receptionists and bar staff throughout our stay. They were quite happy to order taxi's and make reservations at restaurants. We ate at Sa Tanca Crostaceria, La Numanchie (close to the hotel) and Il Tempo Di Inside which I have written reviews on. We decided to book a Terrace Room. On getting to the room it was fairly basic with a double bed, desk and a small cupboard with a safe. The bathroom was tiny and pretty disappointing as it only had a shower cubicle, sink and toilet with room for one person only. However, what made up for this was the view from our peronal terrace over the Colleseum with St Peter's viewable in the background. The hotel had a small bar which was quite cosy but they were fine with us taking drinks to the room (to have on the terrace). We actually did see a couple bring a bottle of wine in and get the hotel to open it without charging any corkage! We were on the Bed and Breakfast option which was a typical continental breakfast of coffee, tea, juices, pastries, cold meats with various condiments. Did the job for us!!! In terms of location this place could not be better. It is 5 minutes walk from the Colleseum and from there you can easily get to the Forum and Monumento a Vittorio Emmanuelle II. There is also a Metro station right by the Colleseum so we got a 3 day pass and used that to get around Rome. The Metro is really easy to use and I would recommend this. There are also plenty of bars and restaurants around the hotel (the nearer to the Colleseum you get the more expensive) so you don't have to venture too far out too find something to eat.

LOCATION: In a big city like Rome, you can either pay a fortune to stay in the pulse of the tourist center, or a little less to stay in a quiet, but accessible neighborhood. Hotel Lancelot\u2019s the quiet neighborhood. The metro\u2019s within walking distance, just make sure you use the rare set of pedestrian crosswalks and lights to get there.

ROOMS: Our room was pretty small, but spotless and surprisingly quite functional. The tiny bathroom had a great shower, the little terrace a spectacular view.

Since the free wireless internet didn\u2019t work so great on our fifth floor, I took my laptop downstairs in the evenings to catch up with friends and family back home. We purchased snacks and Diet Coke at a little neighborhood grocery, and hotel staff provided me with glasses and ice from their bar. BREAKFAST: A lovely space to fuel for the day with standard breakfast breads, yogurts, cereal, juices and coffee. Our English friends said the tea didn\u2019t quite meet their standards, but to us it was all very much British fun. We never ate dinner at the hotel (too many great restaurants in the neighborhood) but the smells from the kitchen severely tempted us each evening.

I don't have anything terrible to say about the place. I don't have anything wonderful to say about it either. And to be frank, I think the rave reviews it has received are very exaggerated. We are a married couple in our early forties stealing a couple of weeks away from the kids. We stayed at Ca' Angeli in Venice and in Antica Torre di via Tornabouni in Florence and loved them both. We expected to love the Lancelot too. We didn't. I'll start with the positive, to give the management their due. The room was clean, breakfast was good, and the library and TV lounge were pleasant enough. We had dinner at the hotel one night, and had a lovely time with a family that I ended up visiting in India a month later. The staff was highly professional, if very busy, and fixed a broken phone and a running toilet in our room promptly. The neighborhood has one good traditional neighborhood restaurant and there is an Indian place not far away (we were a bit sick of pasta by that time). So why did we move? First of all, whoever says this place is centrally located is just full of it. It is close to the Coliseum, but on the other side of it from the rest of the attractions of Rome. It is a long, and, in June, hot walk back home from anywhere else, even the far side of the forum. In March we might not have minded, but in June we definitely did. We ended up moving to the Albergo Santa Chiara, which was one of the most centrally located hotels in Rome, from which we could walk anywhere. Also, this is not a boutique hotel or anything like it. It is larger than that, and is patronized largely by tour groups of senior citizens who like the English speaking ownership and staff. Indeed, the tour operators are so familiar with the place that they will step behind the desk and try to help out when no one else is there. For these folks and for the families with children, the place is great. For us, not so much. Our room was quite small and in no way remarkable. It had a few pieces of beat up furniture and a TV. We had a balcony with two chairs, but it was hot out so we didn't use it. The bathroom was so tiny that it had a folding door. Forget trying to get more than one person into the bathroom. Also, the plumbing stack ran right through the wall between our bedroom and bathroom, which meant that we could hear a cascade of water every time the folks in the rooms above us flushed or took a shower. We could also hear every conversation in the hallway. Basically this meant that we didn't sleep for an hour after we turned off the light, until the folks at the bar downstairs went back to their rooms and settled down for the night. And we were awake with the first shower of the morning. But more than anything else, I remember wondering what exactly we were paying for. It wasn't location. It wasn't privacy and a romantic decor. There wasn't anything special about this place. So we paid a bit more and moved to the Santa Chiara, which had a bigger, quieter room, a much better location, more elegant common spaces, and where we felt like we were in Rome, not London.", "Date": "September 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cheshire, England", "Title": "\u201cFriendly hotel\u201d", "Author": "Masna", "ReviewID": "UR20145404", "Content": "My husband and I have just come back from a ten day stay at the Lancelot last Sunday night.

The staff is amazing and anwered all of our questions to include getting the most out of Rome's buses and subway system.

Not thinking my mother in-law paid for it. After the cab was long gone we realized we were ripped off, and mentioned it to the hotel owner.

There was a small bar for a soda, wine, beer espresso or simple mixed drinks. One night after a grueling day at Pompeii they provided us with a large bucket of ice, their suggestion. We were thrilled. There are small nooks with books and chairs for lounging, a vine covered garden patio with tables and chairs. There is also a small public terrace on the 6th floor that we used several times. The views were wonderful, but the profusion of patio plants made it necessary to stand to see the Coloseum. But I wouldn't change a thing there. They have one of the largest jade plants that I have seen that wasn't in a florist shop. There are several other alcoves that have books and magazines to look at...if one had the time. Great for people watching. There is ample opportunity to watch guests come and go. There was a mix of couples, families, and I saw one tour group while we were there. Our room had a queen bed with a comfortable mattress, the pillows and linens were all fresh smelling and crisp. There was a desk and chair along with an occasional chair. The floors were wood laminate and slippers were provided. While it was unseasonably hot for the last few days in Rome, our room stayed comfortable with the cross ventilation provided by having the windows in the room and bathroom open. I saw and swatted one mosquito. The bathroom while small, was very clean and quite adequate for our needs. Complete sets of towels were provided and the complemntary toiletries were nice quality. A hair dryer was provided. The Breakfast is served in a common dining area furnished with large round tables. We never had a problem finding a seat. And it was an enjoyable way to meet other guests. The breakfast selection provided was wonderful, seasonal fruits, yogurt, pastries, hard rolls, cereals. Several juices and very good coffee. They had sliced meats and cheeses and several interesting packaged meat spreads. You would have to be a very picky eater to not find something to satisfy. We had dinner one night and were very pleased with the set menu. For 25 Euros a person we had a pasta, main dish and dessert. That night it was pasta with black truffle sauce, Chicken Saltimbocca, roasted potatoes and chocolate mousse. A bottle of red and a bottle of white wine was provided for each table and was more than enough. After dinner espesso was also served. We noticed no reluctance of the staff to suggest places to eat. I do suggest being specific about what you are interested in eating as that will elicit a more specific answer. There are many places to eat in the vicinity. The Hotel Lancelot was a big change from the \"matchy matchy\" Hotel chains I am used to in the states. Even the upscale hotels here tend to look the same on every floor. The furnishings in Hotel Lancelot were well cared for but varied. The Buffet in the dining room had crystal and serving pieces you would expect to see in someones home. There were fresh flower arrangements and interesting dried arrangements. There were decorative knicknacks that seemed to be selected as a personal statement rather than by \"design\". Our stay at Hotel Lancelot was very enjoyable. The family that runs the Hotel seems to have found a way to provide a refined yet casual air that seems to be comfortable for a wide variety of travelers. It is not at all stuffy. You might see a couple leaving to go to the opera while another pair is arriving with backpacks and guide books in hand.

Initially, we wanted to stay at another recommended hotel on TripAdvisor around the Trastevere area but we settled on this one instead due to its extremely good reviews. I called the hotel directly and the beautiful Lorena, one of the hotel staff, helped us secure a room for 2 weeks. We also asked for 2 separate pickups from the airport to the hotel since that my boyfriend and I would be arriving at different times, from different locations. Every email we sent was responded within 24 hours. So, we really had high expectations already even before getting there. My plane landed at 6am and 45 minutes later (after the immigration check point and luggage retrieval), I was greeted by the cheerful and friendly Giovanni, the suited driver who drove me to the hotel in a BMW. He was very amused when I tried to speak the little Italian that I knew. He drove around town, stopped at many famous places, and explained to me in details about the history of the places even though he didn't have to do that. All the tiredness from the 12 hour straight flight from Malaysia vanished after seeing how beautiful Rome was (though I noticed that Rome has quite a bit of graffiti on the walls of buildings, then again, I think that is a problem everywhere in major cities in the world). Giovanni's humour and friendliness made me feel very comfortable as I was traveling alone to a country that I have never been to. Later that evening, he picked up my boyfriend from the airport, arriving from United States. I arrived at the hotel around 7.30am and was welcomed by Michael, another staff of the hotel. I was told that I couldn't check in then because the room was not ready yet. It was peak time of the year for tourism in Italy, so I expected that they still had tenants in the room. I was given a complimentary breakfast while waiting for the room to get ready. The breakfast was good. A typical continental breakfast with bread, croissants, butter, cheese, different kinds of cured meat, yogurt, fresh fruits, different kinds of breakfast cereal, coffee, tea, 2 kinds of fruit juice, etc. It might not please everyone's appetite but it definitely wouldn't make you hungry till lunch time. The tables were round, and you share it with other tenants. I found this very interesting. You get to meet people from all over the world. I waited at the cozy lounge and by 11am, my room was ready. Michael escorted me to my room at top floor, saying that I was given one of their nicest rooms. Room #65 had a decent size and smelled fresh. The bathroom was slightly small, but it was not like we were going to spend most of our time in it anyway. The shower was powerful and there was a bathtub, if you preferred to take a bath instead. I have a problem with allergies and some hotels that I have been to would make me sneeze uncontrollably. But that was not the case with Lancelot Hotel. The whole place was beautiful and spotlessly clean. I didn't get an allergy attack at all. My boyfriend and I booked for a double room without a terrace and we didn't expect to get a nice view out of our window. It turned out that we've got a fantastic view of the Colosseum out of our window! And there was a public terrace that we could use on the same floor also, which was fantastic. The television had channels like CNN, Sky News, CCTV (China), a German channel, and some local channels. The personal air conditioning system really helped to cool you off from the heat. At first, we were really worried about laundry because we knew it could get very expensive. Before we got there, we searched for a laundry service in Rome on the internet and found out that it was located far away. We definitely didn't want to drag our dirty clothes to get there. We decided to use the hotel's laundry service. The price was affordable and freshly laundered clothes were sent the next morning. The price of each clothing can be found in the drawer with the telephone on top next to the bed. Another thing that we really appreciated about the room was that it was brightly lit. The shutters outside the window blocked out the sunlight in the morning in case we chose to sleep in. Also, our room was very quiet. No noise from the street below (if you shut your windows), no noise from the room next door. The hotel staff were very helpful. Lorena gave us suggestions where to eat around the area. The gorgeous Annalisa looked through the newspapers and internet to find a movie that we wanted to watch as well as theatres that showed English movies in its original version. Most foreign movies would be dubbed into Italian, in case you'd want to see one. Metropolitan Cinema is one of the very few cinemas who showed movies in its original language. I misplaced my phone charger once and Annalisa helped me recharged the battery in the office. The kind Michael helped my boyfriend with his tie before we went to the Opera. Everyone at the hotel helped us to get around and book for tours or visits. They also gave good suggestions. We had dinner together once at the hotel. The menu was posted at the front desk or in the lift every morning, and we had to inform the staff in advance should we want to have dinner there. It was a 3 course meal, complete with wine and coffee. The meal was fantastic. As usual, we shared the table with other people (2 couples from Norway and an Irish lady). It was a very pleasing affair. They also had a bar which we spent some nights drinking wines or champagnes. The hotel is located not far away from the Colosseum, and yet it has a very private feeling to it. We didn't find the place noisy or crowded at all considering its proximity to one of the most famous monuments in the world. The front gate was always locked, making us feel secured. The map that the hotel gave was very detailed, we never got worried about getting lost since the Colosseum would always lead us back to the hotel. We walked down the road to the very end (about 2 blocks away) and there was the Colosseum on the other side of the road! There was a taxi stand on our side of the road. But we usually called one from the hotel. Otherwise, we would just cross the road to the Colosseum and walked to the right side to get to the Metro station or the bus stop. The Colosseo station was just 2 stops away from Roma Termini (main station). We bought the bus tickets (can also be used for Metro and trams) at the hotel's front desk, otherwise we would buy it at a Tabacchi store at the station. There were many restaurants across the Colosseum, we tried some of them. The rule of thumb we found out about Rome was: The larger the store front is, the more expensive the food is, the more terrible the service is, the more horrible the food tastes. Honestly! Especially the ones directly in front of major touristic sites. There is an exception though. There is a cafe right in front of the Pantheon, directly on the left side of the fountain if you're facing the Pantheon. We went to this place just to sit around for a cup of tea, but we ended up eating. The food there was great! I was coughing when I sat at the table and the very funny and friendly waiter immediately brought me a glass of water. The service there was fantastic. I tried the chamomile tea and it soothed my throat. My boyfriend didn't hesitate to leave him quite a huge tip. Tips: 1. Taxis in Rome can be quite costly. We noticed that it's way cheaper to take a taxi in Milan than in Rome. Always take the certified metre taxi, otherwise you could be conned into paying more, unless you know how much to bargain. 2. Always buy your bus/Metro tickets at the front desk. Save you the hassle. 3. It cost 25 Euro per pax for a dinner at the Hotel. I can tell you that it is WAY cheaper with a better value than most classy restaurants. 4. Giovanni charged me 60 Euro for the pickup from the airport (night time charges applied because I arrived before 7 am). My boyfriend was charged 50 Euro. It was well worth the money. 5. Most shops close at 9pm. Some restaurants open until midnight. We found that the McDonald's inside the Rome Termini was open until midnight. Lancelot was our HOME for 2 weeks. Our stay at Lancelot Hotel made the trip the most wonderful time we have ever had. All the other good things said about this hotel are TRUE.

I couldn't have been more pleased. There is no better location in Rome than the Ancient City, and this hotel is 2 blocks from the Coliseum. I took a taxi from Termini Station (although you can take the Metro to the Coliseum stop-I didn't want to pull my suitcases that far). The Metro Station is 2 blocks from the Coliseum on the opposite side--and the Coliseum is Enormous. There is an elevator in the hotel, and the staff is amazingly helpful in obtaining reservations and offering suggestions for travel around the city. The breakfasts are very good, there's a bar up in front plus a nice sitting room, and my room was exactly what I needed. I was traveling alone, and felt very safe there, they have a locked gate and there's always someone welcoming you at the front desk. The area around the hotel is great for walking-lots of intimate restaurants and a couple of great gelato shops. In the ancient city, I strongly suggest a private tour--the 1/2 day I spent with a History/Art History Guide was worth the 3 other days of time spent learning my way around on my own. (and very worth the $$). The Vatican is another place I'd definitely hire a guide--there are 2-3 hour lines outside all the time, and even in a group tour it's very difficult to keep up, as they shuffle you thru like cattle. I'd recommend a Roma Pass, as you get right in to the Coliseum (one place you don't need a guide) and the Borghese Museum (although Definitely have the hotel make your reservation there a month ahead of time) plus your bus/train pass is included for 3 days. You can go anywhere on the buses without really being lost because the \"Coliseo\" stop is always going to lead you right back \"home\".

Use your mornings and evenings well. We arrived at the Roman Forum at 8.15am ready for it to open at 8.30am. We walked straight in with no queueing. If you go later in the morning you could queue for hours. First thing in the morning or late afternoon are good times for anything that needs queueing.

Our room overlooked the street so we did find it noisy a few nights. On our last night we were facing the rear of the hotel in a triple room (a lot smaller than the quadruple) and this was quieter. Breakfast is all you could ask for and the service very efficient. Dinner looked great but with two young girls it seemed too formal for us. Instead we found restaurants nearby - the best by far in terms of quality and value is La Naumachie, 2 minutes away.

We met up with friends who were staying at the Pantheon Hotel just off the square in the heart of Rome. They were paying 150 euros more per night than our 170 euros at the Lancelot. There was little difference in the hotels. Our friends said the staff at our hotel was friendlier than the Pantheon. Also our hotel was quiet while the Pantheon is in a very noisy area. We took a few more taxi rides than our friends, but the savings on the Hotel made the 6-8 euro taxi ride seem like a bargain. The hotel is clean, the food great, the staff the best. The Kahn family are native English speakers. They couldn't be nicer. They answered all our questions, arranged a side trip to Tivoli that picked us up at the front door, got us tickets for an Opera concert, recommended restaurants, everything. They even sent me to a dry cleaners around the corner that had everything done up nicely in 24 hours. By being just east of the Coliseum, I thought it would be a little out of the way. As it turned out, the hotels around the Piazza Navona and Pantheon are much more expensive and noisy. We were able to walk to St. John Latern church ( a must see), St Peter's in Chains, The Coliseum, The forum. In addition, San Clemenza church ws just one block away. It is famous for having excavations underneath of two earlier temples. You can visit for 5 euro and it is well worth it. The hotel has 60+ rooms and a small bar. There is a delux hotel across the street (Hotel Capo D'Africa) that is very expensive. It has a fine restaurant if you want to splurge. Dinner at the Lancelot was available for 15 euro. It was a set meal of salad,, pasta, entre, dessert. Very good and so convenient after a long day of sight seeing. Everything, including dinners, tickets, side trip, were all billed to the room and handled with a credit card upon check out. They even arranged for a driver to take us to the airport upon departure at the same price we paid for a taxi coming in. Breakfast is great fun. We sat at one of the round tables and others filled in the empty seats.

It's worth mentioning at this point that I booked this hotel entirely on the recommendation of the reviews on Trip Advisor. I was not disappointed. However, I think it prudent to mention the following for the benefit of everyone in particular those of you who have kids. The meals are pre set consisting of one starter, main course and desert. Wine is plentiful throughout the service so if you drink a lot at meal times this arrangement will suit you. We booked dinner bed and breakfast due to the time of the year ( we were not sure what would be open) and after our first meal I changed to bed and breakfast as the kids did not eat anything, there was nothing wrong with the food it just wasn't to their taste. (During my stay I had dinner on 2 occasions and the food was lovely). I asked an employee if he would ask the kitchen staff to prepare something simple for the kids e.g tomato pasta or french fries but this was declined as it was late (after 8.45) so we did not get off to a great start I have to say but this was rectified the following day when Lubna, the owner, sorted things out. I found the desk staff to be very efficient throughout my stay. On the subject of food, breakfast was a simple affair, no hot food at all but this is a \"continental breakfast\" and I fully understand that. The only point I would make is that the croissants are all of the \"sweet variety\" and packed with sugar. Coffee, tea, rolls, jams and cereal are all in plentiful supply and I would recommend that some savoury options would be a much welcome addition. The guests I spoke to all made the same observation. I wouldn't describe this as a \"kids hotel\" as there were a lot of \"older guests\" but this could simply be down to the time of the year, I dont want to put anyone off going with kids, its just something to consider. The Hotel is well located in a quiet street just a couple of hundred yards from the Coleseum and its a great base if you want to be in the thick of things. Eating out is on your doorstep with several really good quality restaurants within 150 yards from the hotel so you do not have to go for dinner bed and breakfast, although if Lubna reads this I am sure she will be very unhappy with my comments. She does, after all, have a business to run. The bar is located in a small room at the rear of the reception area and is fine if you want a quick drink or just want to relax with a book. The New Year celebration was well organised and an opera singer was in attendance to entertain everyone before and during the meal. A belly dancer also entertained, this was a nice touch as soprano isn't to everyones taste so well done for considering something completely different. Dinner took a long 3 hours with the much awaited baked Alaska arriving at 10 mins to midnight, It was great but a wee bit too late as everyone scaled the 6 floors ( the lift only holds 4 people) to participate in bringing in the New Year on the roof top terrace. The fireworks over the top of the coloseum was a spectacle to behold. In conclusion, we loved the hotel and its location could not have been better. Would I go back, yes I would but without the kids next time.

Here are some practical points and tips which you might find useful. If you're flying from Ciampino airport there is a flat 30 euro taxi fee to Rome. Make sure you take an official white taxi [there are plenty of them just outside the airport]. It's quite a schlep from Ciampino to Rome so it is good value and you're not messing around on buses and metros with piles of luggage. The hotel has a brilliant location. You walk down the little street it's on [Capo di Africa] and wham bang there's the Colisseum looming up in front of you. We love walking and Rome is surprisingly intimate - you can get to most places without needing a bus. You might want to take one to the Vatican - we did on our second visit there - we walked the first time. The number 81 stops frequently at the end of the Capo di Africa and you can buy your ticket for the princely sum of one euro from the friendly and attentive reception staff [you can't pay on the bus itself]. The hotel is small and friendly. Our room was OK - tired furniture and some scuff marks on the walls - and we didn't get a balcony - but it was perfectly adequate. The shower and the loo were brilliant - big fluffy towels and excellent maid service. Breakfasts are good: cold meats, silver foil cheeses, fresh rolls and crosissants, decent coffee, cereals and juices. Tables are fairly large so you can have companiable breakfasts with other guests. We didn't try to the evening meals in the hotel but we hear they are good. Tourist Rome more or less stops at the Colisseum so one advantage of the Lancelot is that there are good restaurants nearby which are frequented by locals and which charge reasonable prices. We recommend the Naumachie and ate there twice. We had a grim experience in the Papagio. It looks great but despite booking in advance we were poorly treated - shoved in a corner and kept waiting for over an hour for our first course by waiters with poor eye contact and dirty fingernails. Avoid! A really important tip if you're going to the Vatican: Don't be put off by the huge queues. They move! Above all don't be conned by people promising you wait-free guided tours at 40 euros. They are all deeply dodgy. We foolishly got conned into one but the Vatican police intervened and insisted everybody's money be returned to them. It only costs 13 euros to see all the entire Vatican museum - it is breathtakingly beautiful and you can rent excellent headphones for six euros [[you need to submit a driving licence or passport as a security]. Gents - best buy in Rome are gorgeous silk ties from 8 euros.

We emailed them about 10 times requesting clarification to the reservation, help with booking activities, etc., and each email was answered promptly, accurately and courteously. On arrival and during our stay, all the staff were equally pleasant and helpful. One example, the hotel helped us book an afternoon of horseback riding on the Appian Way. When we left Lorena was at the front desk and made sure we had the address, called taxi, etc. On the way back we had to walk the last mile to the hotel (due to a political demonstration) and we ran into Lorena walking home, She asked how we enjoyed the afternoon, etc. When we got back to the hotel, AnnaLisi was at the desk (just started her shift) and as soon as we walked in she asked us how the horseback riding was as well. Rarely do you find engaged employees like that. We would echo most of the comments in the other reviews, so I wont repeat them all here, just make some select observations. Our room was on the street side, and although some say the street noise is not noticeable, it really is. For light sleepers, this could be an issue, but earplugs easily fix any noise issue. We ate dinner at the hotel each night. Excellent food prepared by a creative chef. First course is pasta, main course was usually meat (fish on Friday) and two vegetables, and a different dessert. Wine and water served with dinner. If someone in your group is having a birthday, it is noted by the Hotel and a birthday cake, champagne, etc is added to the dessert. A nice touch. As others have noted, many places to eat in easy walking distances. One option that worked well for us at lunch was to walk down a block towards the Coloseo and get sandwiches at a corner store (fresh bread and rolls) along with various side items (cookies, chips, olives, cheeses, etc). All fresh and we all ate for 10 euros. The Hotel is everything the other reviewers have said and more.

Makes me think there's some kind of \"fix\", but I can say our stay at the Lancelot was everything we were hoping for and all the previous reviews were right on the mark. The Hotel Lancelot is a wonderful place to stay in Rome. Relatively inexpensive compared to other hotels, clean, excellent staff, good food, and a great location. We stayed four nights and took the taxi in from CIA which cost us 30 Euro. No fuss getting a taxi or feeling pressured to pay more upon arrival. There are signs all over the baggage area informing you about taxi fares and we knew in advance ours would be 30 Euro. Bus service was available from the airport to the main train station, but we would have needed to take a taxi from there anyway, so we just decided to go with the taxi from the airport. The location is in a residential area set back from the Colosseum. You literally can see the Colosseum when standing in front of the hotel and it's only a few minutes walk to it and the Forums. Bus and Metro connections were also about 10 minutes by foot. There were about a dozen small corner restaurants in the neighborhood and we ate at several during our stay. Everything from pretty good/inexpensive to excellent/moderately priced. The reception/lobby area was very well decorated. Exactly what I would expect from a small Italian hotel. Rich woods, antiques, period pictures on the wall. It was lke steppping into a movie. The reception staff was EXCELLENT and set the standard for the rest of our stay. In addition, every staff member we dealt with (even the maid) spoke very good English. Off to the side was a small sitting area with magazines and newspapers which led into the dining area and in the other direction a hallway which led to the bar and garden terrace. Again, the entire area was immaculate, and very well decorated. We took a small elevator up to our rooom and were met with a standard European hotel room...small by American standards. However, it was clean and decorated with antique furniture. There was a bed, small writing desk, end tables, a stand alone closet and a larger desk where the TV sat. The bathroom was also small, but functional. It had a stand-up shower (no tub) and a hair dryer. My wife felt the mirror and shelf over the sink were too small for all her toilettries but I was happy. We did not have a terrace or balcony, so we were somewhat disappointed in that, especially since it appeared our room was the only room without a balcony. Our room overlooked the street and did not have much of a view. The TV was very small (14 inch?) and provided BBC, SKY News, several Italian channels, a German channel and Le Monde (French). One strange thing was the TV provided audio of CNN, but no picture. I was happy with BBC so I never mentioned anything to the front desk and have no idea if it was just our room or the entire hotel that couldn't get CNN. One small problem with the room I did notice was that just below the air conditoner the wall was stained and in the bathroom the paint was peeling in some places. Believe me, this was not a big thing, and after noting it, never paid attention to it again. Breakfast in the morning was standard european style with some juices, cereals, breads, meat, jams, fruits and pastries. Not the best Continental breakfast I've ever had, but good enough and we didn't go hungry. We did not eat dinner at the hotel, but preferred eating at all the corner restaurants that were available within 5 min from the hotel. There is a bar down in the lobby and I took advantage of it after we got back from the free Genesis concert that was 20 min walk from the hotel (I told you it was in a great location). Even though it was late, the bar was open and the drinks were cool and refreshing. Kudos to the staff yet again. There was a very small internet room available but I didn't use it. I believe it cost 1 Euro per hr with a 3 Euro min. I read in a previous posts that WiFi is available, but I didn't bring a laptop to confirm. By far the biggest and only real complaint we had was the noise. For whatever reason, there seemed to be a party in front of the hotel one night with cars and motorcycles racing up the street. To top it off, as the street party finally calmed down, the teenagers in the room above us decided to move the furniture around (literally) and start their own party. That went on for over an hour until I finally got out of bed and went down to the lobby. The receptionist told me he was aware of the problem (apparently I wasn't the only one to complain) and said it would be resolved. Sure enough, 15 minutes later, no more noise. Kudos again to the hotel staff! Even though the noise was bothersome, there's nothing the hotel could do about the party on the street and when made aware of the noise in the hotel, took care of it.

We availed of the limo pick up service from the airport, which is suberb and great value. For 10 euros more than the standard Taxi fare ( 50 V 40) we were met in arrivals by a suited driver who brought us out to a large black mercedes limo and 30 mins later dropped us at the door of the hotel. No stress - just luxury and comfort all the way. I would highly recommend this service as we found that taxi drivers in Rome do not speak English and are not very communicative so it could be a bit difficult to get into a taxi and get to the right hotel. I was travelling with my husband and two children aged 5 and 7. We booked a quadruple room. We were allocated no 10 which is on the first floor. It is a large room with plenty of space for 4 people; a large double bed, a single bed and a large couch/bed . The couch bed was bigger than a standard single. We were more than happy with the accomodation at first, as the bathroom was reasonable big too, which we were not expecting! The best was yet to come, though, as we discovered that we also had a large terrace, approx 12 feet by 15 ft with a table and four chairs and beautiul potted plants all around. In the evenings, after returning from dinner, it was perfect for sitting out with a drink while the children went to sleep inside. We sat there, just down the road from the Colosseum, listening to the sounds of Rome in the distance and loved it! The Hotel location is great, on a quiet side street, near buses and a taxi rank but not too close. You can walk to all the tourist sites, if you don't have a grumpy five year old holding you back. If you do - get a taxi - they are very reasonable. When you leave the hotel if you go left, then left again, there is a lovely cafe/shop which sells ice cream and drinks at local prices as opposed the the tourist prices you nmight pay a few streets away. It also sells great sandwiches and mega coffee.

The rooms size and appearance were very good. We had an inside room and didn't encounter any loud noises at night, but the sound of birds early in the morning woke us up.

We stayed 3 nights at the Hotel Lancelot earlier this month and had a great time. I had decided to split my Rome time between the Lancelot and another, more highly-rated hotel in Trastevere, and though I liked the other hotel part of me wishes I'd spent all my time at the Lancelot. I LOVE the Ancient Rome sites, and the Lancelot is in an ideal location to visit them. In addition I had been told we'd be staying in a Superior Triple without terrace when I booked (though I'd hoped for a terrace) - I was very surprised to find the extremely spacious (by European standards) corner room with balcony on the 5th floor that awaited us. I'm not sure why or how we were upgraded but I didn't complain (or notice an increase in the cost). It was a wonderful way to start our trip and we loved the view of the Colisseum from our terrace. The breakfast was representative of what we'd receive at the other hotels on our trip, and while the food was of high quality I must admit I'm a fan of American breakfasts and missed the toast, bagels, pancakes, eggs, etc you might see in the US. My wife has more refined tastes and liked the selection - my daughter was in my camp. Not a slight on the Lancelot, just on what is standard at Italian hotels. We were too busy to have dinner at the hotel, but smelled it cooking a couple times - wish we could have tried it! We had fun instead trying the casual restaurants all around the Lancelot - there are many to choose from, mostly reasonable, but all with similar menus. I was not aware that the Lancelot would help people book their activities in Rome - a courtesy highlighted by some other hotels we stayed at - but I'd guess the Lancelot would be very capable doing so. On our last evening, and continuing into the next morning, the one (small!) elevator went out of service. As we were on the fifth floor that was a bit of a drag, but it certainly wasn't the hotel's fault. They were kind enough to tell us to leave our luggage in the room on the morning we departed, and after we'd seen some last sites we returned to the hotel to find all our bags had been carried down for us, as promised. (Happily for them the elevator repairman appeared as we were paying our bill). All in all a great stay and probably our favorite hotel of the four we stayed at - I hope to return some day.", "Date": "June 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Marlton, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cAn excellent hotel in Rome\u201d", "Author": "GailKer", "ReviewID": "UR7970813", "Content": "We recently stayed for two nights at the Hotel Lancelot, 47 Via Capo d'Africa.

We arranged our stay directly with the hotel by email. The hotel staff responded to emails promptly and organising the stay was a breeze. We managed to get a 6th floor terrace room (with Colosseum view) for 4 nights, after which we had to move to a 2nd floor room with no terrace. If you can get a 6th floor terrace it is well worth it - taking into account the magnificent view and access to a private garden terrace, it is worth paying the small supplement. The only drawback was that the terrace adjoined a terrace for smokers to use. A group of school kids were staying at the hotel and consequently some nights we had to endure noisy teenagers slamming the terrace door, talking and smoking into the early hours of morning. The stairwell and hard flooring of the hotel added to this noise. In contrast the 2nd floor room was slightly smaller and looked out on the internal courtyard - which is compatively unremarkable. Both rooms were clean, comfortable and both had been uniquely decorated. The breakfast, which is included in the price was quite adequate. We did not try the dinner, so we cannot comment on this - but the smell of it cooking at the end of a long day sightseeing gave the hotel a welcoming homely charm. We had breakfast around 8 most mornings, and never had a problem getting a table to ourselves. The hotel staff made us feel welcome and were polite and informative. Mrs Kahn, the owner, is often at reception and it is obvious that she takes pride and interest overseeing the manner in which the hotel is run. The hotel is beautifully decorated with flowers, books, antique furniture and ornaments, giving it the feel of a home rather than a sterile hotel. The hotel is located on a quiet street within minutes of the Colloseum, making this hotel an excellent base to sightsee. There is also a metro stop at the Colloseum, which might be useful because the walk to other sights such as the Trevi fountain is a bit longer (20 mins maybe), and whilst can be done it does get a bit tiring to do every day!

The only downsides to the hotel were that it could be quite noisy quite early (7-8am) in the street in front of the hotel, though it isn't on a busy street-perhaps some type of construction was going on? It didn't ruin our stay by any means but just a warning to ak for a quiet room if you like a lie in.

The Lancelot was perfect for us. The staff spoke excellent English and were very friendly and eager to help with anything we needed. If you are looking for a large room with spacious bathroom, then this may not be the place for you. You need to go to one of the chain hotels and basically get what you get in a chain restaurant - same old thing! Or, you can spend a lot more money for something elegant with everything you need elsewhere. I would say our Lancelot room was small and simple with a small bathroom - just like a lot of the other European hotels we have stayed in throughout the years. The difference is that the Lancelot was spotless, and we never felt cramped at all - just adjusted because everything else was so nice. We had a large window (some have balconies if you can get them) that opened onto the street with a nice view. I will say that last September I stayed at the Marriott World Center in Orlando, and the bathroom there was no larger than the one at the Lancelot! Every morning they post their evening meal menu to help you decide if you want to dine there that evening. We did two evenings and were not sorry. It is a full course meal with wine included and VERY reasonable. We also enjoyed meeting other guests from all over the world. There is a nice lobby if you are interested in visiting more with some of these people after dinner. We had a friend staying in another hotel who lives in the south of France, and she raved over the beautiful fresh flowers that were all over the Lancelot every time she visited us. Just about everything is close, but we did take a taxi to the Vatican and a few other places just to save time (and feet) because we were only there four days and had a lot to see. I also recommend that you get the Lancelot to get someone to pick you up at the airport if you can swing it. We were so relieved to meet our driver when we got off the airplane and have him literally drop us off with luggage at the door of the hotel because the flight over had been a long one.

Firstly on the positive side the decor of the hotel is of a high standard throughout and the location is reasonably central. But there were a number of things that I didn't like about the hotel. The room I stayed in was small and for the amount that was charged I would expect a larger room. The bathroon was tiny approximately 6 ft x 3 ft and the shower was so small I had problems turning around in the shower. There was no room in the bathroom to hang clothes and the bathroom storage facility consisted of a small shelf overhanging the toilet. So little space existed my partner dropped a few items into the toilet whilst trying to squeeze everything onto the shelf. Housekeeping woke us up 2 mornings in a row knocking on our doors to clean the rooms at around 08:00 and there was no \"do not distrub sign\" to keep them away. The next issue to arise was at breakfast. The restaurant consisted of 7 tables and for a hotel with 6 floors of rooms this was clearly not enough. The first two mornings we went for breakfast we couldn't get a table so ended up eating outside of the restaurant whilst other guests waited for a free table. Not the greatest start to the day and to make things worse there was a single waitress managing the breakfast. As hard as she was trying she was clearly overworked and trying to do the work of about 3 people. I almost got up and gave her a hand. Finally there was a bell to press for the reception to open the gate into the courtyard. Most times this worked fine and the gate would open straight away, but over the weekend we soon figured out that if the manageress was on reception it would involve mulitple rings and waiting on the street for a few minutes until she realised a queue of people were waiting to enter. One evening after letting us in (after only 3 rings) we went to collect the key from reception and she just sat there replying to her emails. After 2 minutes of waiting I went behind the desk and helped myself as she clearly had better things to be doing rather than giving her guests room keys and letting them through the gate. Overall it is a beautiful hotel that is overpriced with small rooms and tiny bathrooms and to stay here you really need an open mind to try and see the comical way the hotel is managed.", "Date": "March 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat little hotel\u201d", "Author": "RobMo", "ReviewID": "UR6851824", "Content": "First and foremost this hotel does everything it sets out to do very well.

There are many sights (mainly the ancient Roman monuments) in walking distance and for further places we took buses. The girl at reception was very helpful with telling us which buses to take from where for our destinations and sold the tickets as well. The continental-style breakfast in the morning was adequate, but it seemed that you had to get there early to get croissants, otherwise only dry rolls were left. We did not take advantage of the evening \u201cround table\u201d dinners. There are some good restaurants in the neighbourhood. We had lunch at Luzzi \u2013 the pasta was good, the tiramisu average (with a bit of plastic in it!) and the coffee delicious.

The terrace features a phenomenal view of the Colleseum and St. Peters. It almost felt like we lived in Rome. One minor compaint: the bathroom featured one of those typical European glass shower partitions that never fail to leak--I've encountered these all over Europe and remain mystified at their popularity.

Overall reaction. Rome is such a zoo with the traffic and action that it seems very important to have a spacious and relaxing place to unwind. This hotel did not qualify on that point as the room was too small.

The only downside of the terrace room: the terrace is not entirely private, as it adjoins a public terrace with only a movable metal gate separating it. Most people respected the gate, but we did have a few surprise moments when people were on our terrace. Also, the fire door was just outside our room door, and repeated opening and closing during the night kept us awake a few nights. The staff is wonderful. Exceedingly friendly and accommodating.

It was quaint and quiet and only 2 blocks from the Colosseum. We were met by Giovanni at the airport which was wonderful and I highly recommend it after a long trip. Our room was a nice size and the balcony was spectacular. The breakfast each morning was very good. Try the Nutella chocolate spread. It is delicious. After a LONG day touring Rome, the small bar in the hotel is a wonderful spot to relax. It is very cozy and opens to a private patio. I would suggest if you want to see a lot of Rome and only have a couple days to do it, to take an escorted tour. There is just too much to see in a short amount of time and if you're not sure where your going, it can get a little confusing. Whatever you do, \"do not\" rent a car. The driving is absolutely crazy here and some of the streets are very small. The only reason I gave this hotel a neutral rating is because of the very last experience we had at the hotel. Let me first say that all but one of the staff members was absolutely wonderful to work with. I was in communication with the hotel for a couple of weeks before we arrived and received great information and wonderful service. The problem arose when we were checking out and I asked for a cab to take us to the train station. The front desk was aware we were 4 adults in a room and were checking out, so we obviously were taking our luggage with us, however, they failed to ask us how many bags we had so when the taxi arrived he could not accomodate us. We had 4 bags, one per person which seems pretty reasonable to me but the cars/taxis in Rome are very small, which is something the locals are aware of and it is their responsibility to make that clear to their guests. Well the taxi driver was very upset because we would not go without our luggage and when I went in to ask the front desk clerk what we should do she became extremely irate very quickly and proceeded to blame and reprimand me for not telling her that we had luggage. I tried to explain to her that I was not aware we had to tell her this since it was obvious we were checking out of the hotel and if this is typically an issue she should be asking her guests a few more questions before calling the taxi. I was really upset by this whole experience because we had enjoyed a wonderful couple of days in the hotel up to this point but this exchange changed my entire opinion and I would probably not stay at this hotel again. The problem is this could have so easily been avoided if this particular woman had done her job correctly to begin with and if she had handled it the appropriate way afterwards. I didn't mind paying the taxi for coming to the hotel, even though I didn't feel like it was our mistake. I realize we are in a different country and communcation is sometimes strained, but it was the way she handled things that made the situation so bad. I had just given this hotel $500.00 and this woman is berating me in front of everyone in the lobby because of a mistake she made. A wonderful gentleman then took over and told us he would call another cab for us. It took about 20 mintues for the second cab to arrive and while we were waiting, he came out and apologized to us. Although it was very nice for him to do this and we appreciated it very much, it was not his responsibility to apologize for something that someone else did. Moral of this story is, if you are going to stay at the Hotel Lancelot and have luggage, make sure to tell the front desk how many pieces you have upon checkout and that you need a LARGE taxi.", "Date": "March 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cFantastic hotel - great location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4586503", "Content": "We had the most wonderful five days at this lovely hotel in Rome, which is how I imagine hotels used to be, in a delightfully old fashioned way.

The Roman Forum is just beyond the Colosseum. It is in a quiet area, but as all hotels go, there is quite a bit of activity rather early in the morning and the noise can be a distraction in the hotel rooms. If you're an early riser, this won't be too much of a problem, but if you intend on sleeping in, you probably won't have much luck with it! As an American living in Europe for 4 years, the one thing you have to realize first is that hotels are not the same as in the US. The rooms are smaller and the sound-proofing isn't normally as good. Once you get over this difference, you can easily enjoy the hotel rooms, especially since the only reason you'll be there is to sleep! We are a family of four (inc. kids aged 12 & 10) and stayed in a quadruple room, number 71, on April 3-7, 2005. It's on the first floor in an adjacent building, just outside the main building. While the beds (big double and two singles) and the bathroom were clean, there were quite a few dust bunnies that could have been dealt with, but the windows are always open (in the spring anyway) and the hardwood floors do often encourage the build-up! I do have to complain about the shower, as the floor got quite wet (the doors are really poorly designed) and the showerhead would not stay in place when you tried to raise it up higher. Good thing I'm only 5'9\", as taller people will get rather annoyed at this. The air conditioning was barely adequate in this particular room with the warm weather we had (about 75) and I suspect that it will have real difficulty keeping up with the hot summers. As I said the rooms are smaller in Europe and this room was no exception. I don't mind, but we were a bit cramped. The beds were great though and we were all very tired from walking all day. Sheets were cleaned daily. Some people mention TVs in these reviews and I usually have to laugh because it's always the Americans who complain the most. This might surprise you, but nearly all Europeans don't speak english, so don't expect english language stations to be plentiful. Be happy you're on holiday in beautiful city and keep the TV off. If you do have to watch, the Lancelot had BBC News and CNN (I think), so you can get caught up with the news at least. Breakfast was good, but again, it is European standard. So, no eggs and bacon for those used to it. Simple breads, fruit, yogurt, Italian coffee, decent fruit juice and packaged cheeses and pate where the course for the day. I was expecting more meats and cheeses to be offered, but this was OK for us. I think this should be upgraded to include more for its guests. We did not have dinner here, but the word on the street is that it's very nice. It is a family style atmosphere and you will sit with strangers, but in our experience, these types of dinners can be very enjoyable. The staff are very friendly and their English is of a very good standard. They are helpful and will give you good advice. Overall, we paid 200 euros per night for our room, which compared to others I researched is very competitive for the location and standard of accomodation. I felt it was very good value for money. A couple of last pieces of advice: - Take the option for a taxi to the hotel from the airports, especially if you are a family. The luxury and convenience of this door-to-door service is well worth the price (60 euros one-way) and you'll get some tourist information from the driver (we did anyway). Removing the hassle is a good start to the trip and a nice relaxing way to finish it. - Use the buses! Get a map of the bus routes or memorize where the major piazza's are and find your way around. We bought bus tickets, which is recommended by the tour guides, but never validated them. The locals never validate them (if they even carry them) or at least, we never saw any locals do this. The only people I ever saw validate theirs were tourists like us. We never paid for our transport around town and saved us quite a bit of money!

The hotel is in a decent location near the Coliseum. During our first night, we were given a room facing the interior courtyard. We experienced two problems. First, it was unseasonably warm and, since our room faced the courtyard, there was no breeze or circulation. It became uncomfortable in our room and we tried to turn on the air conditioning. It didn't work and when we called the front desk we were informed it had been shut off for the season. Second, we managed to drift off the sleep only to be woken a short time later by the sound of a young child from one of the neighboring apartments singing at the top of his lungs. Strangely enough, he was singing \"Old MacDonald Had a Farm\" in Italian. Incredibly, this went on for at least half an hour (although he did sing a few other songs). We tried shutting the window but it was simply too hot in the room for that. Shortly after this impromptu concert ended, and we had drifted back to sleep, we were woken again by the sounds of a couple having a heated argument on the ground floor of the courtyard. Having had more than enough of this, I leaned out the window and politely asked them to please lower their voices. I can't repeat the response I received. Needless to say, the argument continued at the same volume. We subsequently spoke with other guests who had interior rooms who agreed that the noise from the courtyard is a big problem. Breakfast the next morning was a pleasant surprise. A variety of fruits, cereals, pastries and other foods was available and was included in the cost of the room. Based on our experience of the night before, we requested a new room at the front of the hotel facing the street. The lady at the front desk said a room was available, but that, since it was larger than the room we had originally booked and had a street view, she would have to charge us $20 euros more. The new room was an improvement in terms of temperature, noise level and overall comfort, except that the bathroom was not completely clean.", "Date": "April 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cA home away from home!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3291770", "Content": "I just got back from my first trip to Rome and stayed four nighs at the Hotel Lancelot.

It provided a home away from home for our family of 4 (2 adults, 2 teenagers) for 2 nights in mid-February 05. A well-deserved 5 stars. Why? Location: On a quiet, partially residential street a five minute walk from the Colesseum (we could glimpse it from our 4th floor balconey). Two blocks from the bus stop where you can catch a bus to Vatican City and many other tourist spots. Tickets available for purchase at the hotel's front desk. There's a small market just down the block that's great for buying snacks (or putting together a picnic lunch). The Room: If you're not looking for hotel chain lux, it's perfect. Our room (family room #45) was spacious (even by U.S. standards) with comfy beds and lounge chair, modern bath, spotlessly clean with the added bonus of a small balconey. The lounge: Comfy/homey place to relax. After a day of touring, while my kids played a game of chess, we compared notes with fellow guests from England, New Zealand, France, U.S. Meals: Breakfast is buffet style, continental rather than English, but abundant with cereal, fresh breads and fruit. Dinner is available nightly for a set price (discounted for longer stays). Prepared by the owner's son with fresh ingredients and care and served in the pleasantly appointed dining room. Guests seat themselves at large round tables (another great opportunity to chat with the eclectic group of people who have been lucky enough to find this hotel). Best for last: The owner, Mrs. Khan, and her sons as well as the rest of the hotel staff make you feel welcome (a novelty these days) and exemplify the best in service. During our short stay they suggested daily intineraries, provided maps and written directions, directed us to a church near the Pantheon that provided one of our best experiences ever (look up!), offered help with our rental car, arranged for a van to the airport, etc.", "Date": "March 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cComfortable, quiet, convenient\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3215215", "Content": "Stayed in September 2004 for 5nts, in a 4th floor double room with small balcony facing the front (\u20ac152/nt) and I'd recommend this hotel.

The shortest public transport way from FCO airport is to avoid the Leonardo Express to Termini. Instead get the normal train into Rome and change onto the Metro or Tram at Ostiense (cheaper too).
