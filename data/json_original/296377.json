Quite easy to find from the Sultanahmet tram stop, room was excellent with comfortable double bed, very good bathroom and shower, air conditioning, and kettle with supply of tea & coffee. There was free use of the safe in the room for valuables. On the advice of the Lonely Planet guide we took a universal sink plug, which is needed in the bathroom for shaving. Staff were all very helpful and friendly, most of them spoke good English. Wide range of food at breakfast, cereals, muesli, yoghurt, fruit, meats & cheese, olives, pasta salad, several different breads & pastries. Had a good meal in the Terrace Restaurant the first evening. The hotel is 5 minutes walk from the Blue Mosque, and a little farther from the Hagia Sophia (Ayasofia) Museum, Grand Bazaar and Topkapi Palace. Tram stop is handy to go to the port at Eminonu for Bosphorus Cruises or ferry crossings, and the tram also goes over the Galata Bridge to Karakoy for modern Istanbul, Taksim Square etc. Note that some of the attractions are closed on Mondays. Just round the corner from the hotel are numerous bars, restaurants and cafes, with a wide range of dishes. For a nightcap we recommend a raki at the Hippodrome bar on Kucuk Aya Sofya Cad, or tea and snacks at the Cafe Mesale in the Arasta Bazaar behind the Blue Mosque, where they have whirling dervish displays.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Uppsala, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cThank you\u201d", "Author": "Vagabondos", "ReviewID": "UR127083079", "Content": "It was difficult from begining to choose one hotel in Istambul as there are so many, but after one week in Hotel Albatros it feels that we made the rigth choice.

At 45 USD, it was okay but this is certainly not worth any more. The room was just enough to fit a double bed and have some space around. Bathroom was clean but staff didn't clean it properly and there was underwear and other toiletries from the previous guests! Some rooms have a balcony overlooking the streets, also not cleaned and was full of ash and cigarette buds. The staff is good at things that are expected of them but very reluctant and stubborn otherwise. While we were there, a couple had booked a room but it was for single use and staff was very unaccommodating charging them almost the room price for breakfast. I think it finally got sorted when the manager arrived, a few hours later after we were done with breakfast. We found this quite frequent in Turkey where staff were helpful only so far as they were getting anything and absolutely rude once payment was done, with exceptions of course. Breakfast is good and certainly the highlight. The hotel is walking distance to attractions nearby, taking about 20 minutes uphill to reach the Sultanahmet tram station. The neighborhood is quite pretty and certainly worth walking around though there's little to do around here. There is another area behind the Blue Mosque/ Arasta Bazaar which has a lot more hotels with bars and restaurants open at nights and, importantly, about half the distance to the tram station. We tried booking our return leg while we were there but staff did not give us the booking.com prices!

Breakfast was good, served on the top floor rrestaurant which has a nice terrace, but watch out from the birds (albatros) which can come very close to your table and can literally steal some of your food (they stole some of my cheese !!) I stayed with my husband in this hotel for 4 nights, and when we were about to go to bed, I had noticed some hair on the bed sheets (that didnt belong to us) beside some dirt of \"unclear\" nature under the pillow, so I called the reception to send someone to change the bed sheets as either the room service did not do thier job properly during the day or they have serious problems with thier washing machines, anyway they changed them and we got to sleep. the next day when I wanted to shower there was a problem with the drainge and the water kept accumulating in the shower and later started flooding out to the bathroom floor, we asked them to send someone to check and fix it, which they did, but then when my husband went to shower, the problem was back and clearly whoever they sent to fix it, did not do it well.. they told us the world cup games were broadcasted in the channels that was avaiable in the rooms, but when we got there, the channels did not show any game, so we had to call and ask for it to be fixed. Dispite the issues we had with our room, the staff were in all occasion quite helpful and freindly and offered the best they could to make it a comfortable stay for us.
