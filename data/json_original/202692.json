I travelled here with my best friend in August, and had requested a twin room when booking (through jet2 holidays).

We left our luggage and went off to explore a little. Found a lovely little cafe just a few minutes walk away 'La Bauta' snack bar, the guy working there is soooo friendly! We got back to the hotel at 2, and was given the key. No help with luggage which was dissapointing as 2 young women? The room was fine. A little smaller than the images looked but clean and everything in order. A fridge in the room was wonderful as we moved some stuff out of the minibar and put our water there. The air conditioning was very welcome as it was over 30 degree outside! Our room looked into the hotels courtyard, but also into somebodys flat - not a massive issue. It was very quiet. No noise whatsoever at night, and couldn't hear into anybody elses room as one reviewer said. The bathroom was also clean, very small but it was Venice. The shower was powerful, but no hot water during the day? (we wanted to shower when we first arrived). Towels were changed and room made up everyday to a high standard. Was expecting amazingly friendly staff from previous reviews - the gentleman during the day was not friendly. My friend thought he was rude, I wouldn't go so far (I'm quite laid back and bubbly!) but defo not friendly. However the chap thats on in the evening was great, chatty and happy to help; he should work the day! The hotel were not pushy. Some hotels have deals with cafes, or trips etc they never try to sell us anything. Breakfast was basic, I don't 'do' breakfast but would go and get a class of orange juice. My friend seemed quite happy with bread rolls and ham etc. I would have liked the TV to have had one sky chanel - like an international news station or something!?

The main train station is also very near. The Gardena Hotel is a short walk from here - and this is welcome when pulling luggage! Venice is expensive, but the further you are from St Mark's Square, the cheaper it gets and public transport is efficient and a good way to see the Grand Canal on the way to St Marks. There are lots of places to eat in this area. Our room was larger than many in Venice and clean and comfortable. We enjoyed a quiet night's sleep and breakfast in the morning was typical Italian buffet style - not exciting but perfectly adequate. Only one member of staff seemed to be working in the restaurant so there was a delay in geting our coffee. The hotel was happy for us to leave our luggage for a couple of hours after we checked out.

Ivan on the front desk in the evenings was a very friendly guy who gave us good tips for nearby restaurant's which were good quality with prices not too steep.He also seems very knowledgeable about most things Venice. Room was clean if basic, but had good shower and bathroom with a very firm bed and very clean sheets, all the essentials one needs when travelling. Breakfasts were a little limited with no hot food but it was all was very fresh, and waiting staff were friendly. Hotel was usually quiet ay night but was some boat engine noise in the early mornings as small commercial barges and boats used the canal below. We came at the end of festival time and the last day was very crowded everywhere but all good natured, after the festival ended it became much less crowded and easier to move about especially near St marks square. Restaurant's can be very pricey and it is best to avoid being upgraded by waiting staff with you menu choice as this usually is a very expensive option, we saw various couples throughout our stay that were very unhappy with their bill ,an example being two American/Canadian ladies who were charged 30 euros each for the special sea bass option running that night, so what with cover charges and service charges all added, not to mention separate prices for potatoes etc that came with the fish, and an expensive wine, must have paid in excess of 100euro, and this being a fairly ordinary Trattoria. All things considered about the Gardena is that it is a very good 3 star Hotel that makes a good base to explore Venice and its surrounding areas and we would certainly recommend it if you are looking for a good clean basic Hotel in a good location and not too expensive, in fact, for what we paid(travel agent rates) was excellent value.", "Date": "March 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "CUMBRIA,ENGLAND", "Title": "\u201cExcellent value for money\u201d", "Author": "BUCEPHALES", "ReviewID": "UR99426426", "Content": "Stayed Monday to Friday during Carnival.Beginning of March 2011. Very cold windy weather which was not usual for Venice in early spring and it somewhat dampened the Carnival atmosphere.

However our hotel always greeted with warmth and comfort. Many thanks to Ivan for all his invaluable help in his restaurant recommendations in the locale of the hotel. All were of the highest standard without breaking the bank. I shan't list them here-ask him yourself! A delightful man to talk to and chat with-your satisfaction is his priority.The hotel is very close to the bus and railway stations. Not very far to drag one's luggage over the bridges. The room that we had (32) was top notch for comfort,cleanliness and well appointed. The view out of the window was directly onto the canal outside and overlooked a garden park area . To the right you can watch the busy NW end of the Grand Canal.There was no welcome tray but there was a well stocked fridge at (as expected) very high prices. A little disappointed that the hotel bar was not well stocked; as we do enjoy a little tipple at the end of a long day getting lost in Venice ,but then again we were rather early in the season in spite of it being Carnival. Breakfast was ample,but no cooked food,i.e.bacon,sausages or toast. No problem though the food on offer was excellent. All the staff were very friendly and the service very good. We would heartily recommend the Gardena to any one looking for a well placed,comfortable,clean,and excellent value for money. ( We booked through Hotels4u-a branch of Thos Cook. We have found this site to be very competitive price-wise compared to all the others by several hundred pounds) So with the Gardena as your base indulge yourself in the fascinating city of Venice. Get lost and enjoy it's calles,campos,piazzas,awesome churches,islands and museums.Enjoy the food prepared in the Venetian manner in the trattorias etc. especially the fish. Invest in a vaporetto pass,buy it on the net before you go,otherwise it will cost you 6.50 euros every trip. You will need at least 4 days in Venice to appreciate just a little of it's dreamlike magic. Wander the streets early morning and late at night for even more mysterious atmosphere.

As mentioned by other reviewers, it is superbly located just over the bridge from the railway station, and a short walk (4 minutes) and 2 bridges from Piazza Roma, where the taxis and buses arrive. This is very important - we spent the weekend seeing tired tourists haul suitcases around the narrow streets and over canal bridges to get to their hotels! We got the bus from Marco Polo airport, which is superb - every 20 minutes and only 2.50 Euro's one way. We bought the 3 day publc transport pass at the airport, which includes that bus journey plus all water buses around Venice - which is great value and makes getting around Venice and the other islands fun. The hotel itself is small and on a quiet side cancal, just off the Grand Canal. We had a small room at the back - two twin beds pushed together, which wasn't ideal. If possible, ask for the rooms as the front - half are bigger but at least you have a canal view if you end up with a smaller room! We booked it through \"X cape with us\" (UK website) and paid \u00c2\u00a3120/night bed and breakfast, which for Venice, is good value. Breakfast was nice, staff very pleasant.

The location is great if you arrive by train because you don't have to drag your luggage very far on boats and through winding alleys. Just over a bridge, a little ways down, and you're there! It is also really easy to find, which is not always true of hotels (or anything) in venice. The city is so small and the water buses are so cheap that this location is great for exploring. The \"bus stop\" isn't a far walk and if you go the opposite direction (left out of the hotel door) you can explore back streets and find some great cathedrals. While we were there, the owner helped us out by giving us a map and circling cathedrals with beautiful art (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free!). Personally, I truly enjoyed the daily water bus ride down the grande canal. In about 20 minutes you can be at St. Peter's. But it's like a cheap river tour every day!

We arrived in this city of beauty in the rain by taxi, having missed our water transfer but wouldn't let this dampen our initial view. The Hotel and the city were so very relaxing, we could have spent our entire week there. Without worry of dodging autos and motor vehicles, and soaking in the sheer beauty of the water city, the relaxation was well worth the plane ride there. We had expected dirty canals and odors as many told us but found the opposite. People were friendly, helpful, the city overflowed with atmosphere and beauty. Our concierge, Lucia answered our every need. Our hotel was on the canal where each morning we could enjoy seeing supplies being brought up and down the canals readying for another day in Venice. Food was pretty much the same, Pizza and paninis; wines were terrific, Island Murano is worth the taxi ride which is free through most of the Hotels if you ask. Travelers benefit when they find a nice outdoor cafe, listen to the Venetians and be one with the city and soak in everyday events that may not occur where you live. An example: the building of a new dock was something we enjoyed watching. We found the 30 minute gondola rides to be overpriced, overcrowded in the canalways and not worth the Euros, so we walked, walked, enjoyed and are ready to book another flight to Venice for a longer period of time. A few pointers: Get the three-day water taxi ticket; talk to your concierge about rides to Murano, gondola deals, exceptional places to see. They are an abundance of information. A person can walk the entire city in a few hours and see the total Venice from churches to Acadamia.", "Date": "October 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cGrand little place\u201d", "Author": "Joe723", "ReviewID": "UR3796482", "Content": "We were pleasantly surprised with this choice. .

It completely exceeded our expectations. First, it is very close to the train station - just walk over the bridge, and it is about a 3-5 minute walk to the right of the bridge. Being close to the station meant we were close as well to the main waterbus terminal, Ferrovia, which we took to get to the main attractions further down the Grand Canal. Second, the room was gorgeous and the staff were extremely helpful. We stayed in room 32 and we did NOT want to leave! The bathroom was all marble (floors and walls), with an old-fashioned sink and tub with beautiful detailing and design. The toilet had a wooden seat so it wasn't freezing cold when we sat down on it (small, but important detail!) The bed was queen size with a velvet headboard. The air conditioning was self-adjustable. In terms of view, I think we had the best view you could ask for - we were facing a smaller, more quiet canal but to the right we also had a spectacular view of the grand canal, with the water buses and taxis chugging by. The wardrobe was huge - enough room to fit both our things and more. Third, the area of the hotel is fantastic. It is away from the main touristy areas so a short walk gets you to some fantastic restaurants and shops.

The hotel is just off the Grand Canal, about a 10 minute walk from the train station. It would not be even that long, if one could walk on water, but the bridge is quite nearby. Do realize that the rather large bridge traversing the Grand Canal here has steps on both sides, which is quite inconvenient for all the arriving tourists and their heavy luggage. So while you do save money and hassle by not needing a water taxi or vaporetto (bus), it still isn't an ideal situation, but oh well. The breakfast was comparable to other European continental breakfasts. Nothing too exciting. The staff were incredibly kind, though, and more than willing to help with all my obnoxious requests. They were also able to help book a reasonably-priced gondola ride as well. I would certainly be willing to stay here again, but the most glaring negative is that it is definitely a long way from San Marco's Square, where most of the sites and action are.", "Date": "July 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newington, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay at the Gardena\u201d", "Author": "bdublu", "ReviewID": "UR3638046", "Content": "Great hotel.
