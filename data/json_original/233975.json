Since I was meeting up with her towards the end, decided I would check out the capital. Flew in to Berlin after a couple of weeks in Athens. Getting to know Berlin was a great little exercise in exploration. Tip: take advantage of the famous free Berlin tour. Arrived at Schoenefeld airport and took the AirportExpress train into the center of Berlin. From there got onto the S Bahn and got off at Zoo Garten stop and walked from there. First time there got a little lost. Went down the Kurfustendamm when I should have been looking for Kurfustenstrasse. Oh well. Anyway, found it and eventually found the hotel. The lobby was nice and large and the reception desk was to the left. To the right was an entrance to the next door restaurant. Check in was relatively easy. The young ladies working the front desk spoke broken english, but enough for us to understand each other. Got in a little early, but the room was ready so checked-in. Got the key and took off to my room on the 3rd floor. It was a standard room, which is the smallest one they have. It was simple and basic, but at least the bed was comfortable. Everything was clean so there were no complaints there. This is a quiet part of town and there are a few upscale hotels in the area as well. The best part is that it was a short walk to KaDeWe, which was a great experience of what department stores used to be like a long time ago. For the price, this place was hard to beat and even attempted the stay here the second time I was in Berlin, but they were completely booked, which was not a surprise. Next time I'll be sure to make a reservation.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cairo, Egypt", "Title": "\u201cBusiness Hotel\u201d", "Author": "HappyLife32", "ReviewID": "UR126901067", "Content": "The room was very nice and clean. the breakfast was also nice.

Breakfast is 10 euro extra... though, didnt use it even though it looked nice, as lots of nice cafes around hotel. We landed in Berlin Scefeild airport... which is about 18killometers from the centre of Berlin. We asked at airport information desk, and trains run dirrect into Berlin every 30minutes, the RE4 train. It cost 4 euro each one way, bargin better than paying 40 euros in a taxis. There is a 15 minute walk from the airport to train station, safe and eaily.... The train is dirrect into Zoo garchachter station, only three stops, and takes 30 minutes. Then you can either walk to the hotel which takes 15 minutes, or get 100 bus which pases, straight by station and takes you to hotel. The 100 bus runs day and most of night, and takes you to most of all the sites in Berlin.... costs 4 euros for a dialy ticket. The hotel is smart and business like, reception staff, and friendly speech english. The room had a large bath and shower above it, Mini bar in room. Which we emptied and filled with stuff we bought from the large NETTO straight over the road from the hotel..... Towels are changed everyday in hotel, but bedding every two days...

This hotel does everything just about right. The staff are friendly and helpful. I was offered a map when I checked in, which was a good start, and they also sell the daily ticket for unlimited travel on buses and trains. Other things too, no doubt, such as the Berlin Card which I believe includes discounts for various attractions. I didn't get one so I'm not sure. It is worth staying at this hotel for the breakfast alone. It is superb with just about everything you could want. Again, the staff are very attentive and helpful, and the kitchen staff are always checking that items are not running out, in stark contrast to a hotel in my last review. The rooms. I had a small single, facing the street. This was not a problem in October, but you would need the windows open in summer and it would be noisy. You need to ask for a room at the back of the hotel. It would be nice if the hotel could at least provide a small fan in the room in summer. Perhaps they do. Heating was good against the eight degrees outside when I was there. The tv had a large range of channels, including BBC World and CNN. And here's a nice touch - they appear to have 'doctored' the sound so it can't be turned up too high and disturb other guests. There is a lobby bar, but the seating appears to be aimed more at groups than couples. The barman, like the other staff, was friendly. Location - the 100 bus stops outside, and that passes many or the city's tourist sights. It also takes you to Zoo station, where you can connect to the very frequent bus to the airport. This are both normal city buses, with no special fare. The Zoo is five minutes walk, and the main shopping area five minutes beyond that. I paid a quite ridiculous 98 Euros for two nights. Breakfast was 10 and worth every Eurocent, and 24 hours wifi in the room costs 5. There are also two free terminals off of the lobby. What is wrong with the hotel? Nothing, unless you get a hot room in the summer. One final point - one reviewer - WailengP - is confused and seems to think the hotel is the former DDR.

We went there on our honeymoon and the gentleman at the front desk upgraded us for free to a suite. I thought that was really nice. The breakfast was really good! The room was like an apartment . Very big. Like I said he upgraded us to a suite on the 10th floor. Hotel was very clean.As well as the rooms. I give this hotel from a scale of 10 an 8. I would def stay here again. The price was right. The location was good. 7 min walk to the zoo, 5 min walk to KADEWE (shopping mall) . Brandenburg gate was about a 35 min walk .No big deal. You could take the bus 100 in front of the hotel and it drops you off in front of the Brandenburg Tor. It also goes along Uder de linden. I think a Transit day pass cost us 4 euro each a day. Now the CONS: Not to many ,but worth saying. If you come in the summer be aware there is no air conditioning in the rooms . It got pretty warm at night the room. I had to open the windows. The hotel only has 2 computers for guest to go on and it was sometimes hard to get to, because someone almost everytime we passed by was on it. Wi-fi was a charge as-well .

I found it on Expedia and was convinced to try it as the reviews seemed fair, and the price was very good. It also appeared to be in a good location. We were not disappointed, the hotel is 5 mins walk to Wittenburgerplatz U-Bahn station, and has bus stops right outside for the 100 bus service which runs from the Zoo through the heart of the city to Alexanderplatz very frequently. No need for a hire car here. The area around the hotel was very pleasant and although there was an erotic bar not far away, the area was far from seedy even late at night, in fact the neighbourhood seemed quiet. There were restaurants on the street, several shops including a small supermarket opposite and restaurants in the Wittenburgerplatz Square. A decent meal or places to have a drink were never far away. The Zoo was 10 mins walk, and the area around central Kurftendam 10-15 mins walk at most. Our room was clean, of a decent standard and with all the comforts we wanted. A clean bathroom with decent shower. Two comfortable beds, decent sized room and wardrobes. There was a TV which was not a Pay TV (unless you wanted certain types of movies) and most of the free stuff was of course in German, anyway we didn\u2019t come to Berlin to watch TV all day. Minibars in the room a little pricey, but you don\u2019t have to rely on it as there are plenty of nearby shops. Room was hot but had large opening windows and a table fan provided so it was manageable. We didn\u2019t take the breakfast buffet at 10 euros, and it was noted that the price had been dropped already. We used the bakery/caf\u00e9 on the corner one morning for fresh coffee and pastries (under 5 euros for two people) and on other days we used a delightful bar in Wittenburgerplatz called Noah\u2019s which opened for breakfast early and did a very nice scrambled egg & bacon breakfast for 5 euros. We also had a very tasty evening meal here one evening and I\u2019d recommend it if you are the sort of person who doesn\u2019t want to depend on whatever the hotel provides. The staff were pleasant and helpful, the hotel clean, quiet and in good order. The neighbourhood pleasant and the location/transport connections as good as I could have asked for.

Customer service was very good and staff on the reception desk are very security conscious and polite, with most speaking enough English to overcome any language difficulties for those without German. Hotel was clean and bright. We had a junior suite on the 10th floor. Spacious room, nicely decorated with mahogany furniture. Bath had a shower head unit over it and it was a bit on the squashed side when the shower curtain was pulled across. But that was just a little niggly issue. Good storage for clothes, 2 leather chairs and a round table in addition to bed. Kitchen area was unfortunately obsolete as there were no utensils for using with the facilities (kitchen sink, cupboards, cooker, fridge) without paying extra. It did have a fridge which was great for keeping drinks cool and making icecubes. There was no air conditioning in the room (at 35 degrees, this would have been beneficial), however, a desk top fan was provided. No tea/coffee making facilities in the room. It was a quiet, relaxhing hotel atmosphere. Breakfast on site was 10 EUROS per person, with a wide range of buffet style options and in pleasant surroundings. However, we tended to use the cafe/restaurant next door (immediately to the left when coming out of hotel) which had a sun garden at the back and where breakfast was 5 euros. Avoid the English Breakfast though as it's not the traditional one that we know and love in the UK - it came with butter beans not baked beans! The room doesn't have the flowers in the base etc as is in the photo of the hotel online, and no chocolates on the pillows but all in all, it was very good value for money, in a good location, with good service and clean. Location was good - five minutes walk to the Wurtemburg Platz station (U2 line) and about ten minutes walk from the Zoo station. Some comments got us worried on other websites with talk of Kurfurstenstrasse being 'red light' area. There were a few thai massage shop premises and an erotic maze labyrinth around but what ever activity went on must have gone on behind closed doors, because we didn't see any thing of concern and it certainly wasn't a seedy area. If going to Berlin again, would have no hesitation in staying at Sylterhof again and it would be suitable for couples and for families.

We flew in from Liverpool Airport with Easyjet to Schonefeld. We took the S Bahn (less than 3 Euros) from the airport to the Zoologischer Garten, then a cab which was about 5 Euros from the station to the hotel. We found Sylter Hof convenient for the S Bahn/U Bahn and the centre of West Berlin. The rooms were clean and bright, on the smaller side but with plenty of closet space, desk, tv and the bathroom was clean and reasonably sized. It reminded me a bit of your average Holiday Inn or similar chain type hotel. We were greeted courteously by the check-in staff, who explained there had been a mix up over a request for non-feather bedding, but this was rectified straight away. The lobby and building style itself is a bit tired and 60's/70's looking but we found our room to be clean (apart from the disgusting, filthy, crusty remote control - maybe it's a bit of OCD but it was gross) if a little bit stuffy. There was a fan in the room which we made good use of, but I would certainly say this hotel would benefit massively from A/C. The facilities list use of an ironing board but you have to obtain a key from reception and use the iron in the housekeepers store room We were on the 6th floor but found that there was quite a lot of road noise when the windows were open, even though we were at the back of the hotel. Fortunately myself and my boyfriend are used to road noise so that didn't bother us too much, but if you are used to peace and quiet you will probably have difficulty sleeping here and have to make a decision between heat or noise. In the mornings there was noise coming from construction at the back of the hotel. We found the location great for exploring the old West, it is kind of on the border of south Tiergarten and Kurfurstendam. It is very close to the Europa Centre and the Zoo (don't go there, all the animals are in $hitty small enclosures and are going stir crazy, if you like animals and care about animal welfare this is not the place for you, don't give them your money and look at what PETA have to say about them). Anyway, I digress, the department store KaDeWe is about a 5/10 minute walk away towards the back of the hotel, so if you go down any of the side streets either side of the hotel you can get there really easy. This is located on Wittenbergplatz (I think), there were numerous cafes, bars and restaurants in this area as well as the U Bahn, which is only a few stops away from Potsdamer Platz. Potsdamer Platz is actually about a 30 minute walk away and there are numerous shops, bars, cafes and restaurants there and you can go via the diplomatic area, where all the embassies are clustered, and the attractions of the Kulturforum. Once you are at Potsdamer Platz the Reichstag, the Holocaust memorial and the Brandenburg Gate are within walking distance. Unfortunately we were there during the Germany vs Spain football game and most of this area was closed off for the football fans and the team homecoming. Berlin on the whole struck me as a very safe and clean place to go, even the football fans were civilised and instead of a riot ensuing when Spain won, Spanish supporters were given pats on the back, hi-fives etc! There is lots to see and and do in Berlin, my only regret is that we didn't spend longer there and see more of the East, we went on a bus tour (which we picked up on the Ku'Damm) but this didn't really give us the chance to explore the East properly. I would recommend this hotel as it is clean and a decent place to crash at the end of a long day, it is basic and comfortable but as I said, the lack of A/C and an excess of road noise, combined with ongoing construction at the back does let it down. Also I can't imagine any breakfast being worth 12 Euros or whatever they were charging, I would recommend going to a cafe on Wittenbergplatz. Also, it worked out cheaper to book it through expedia than direct with the hotel, it cost us \u00a3196.95 for 3 nights, including fees/taxes. My word of warning would be ordering a cab for your journey home, the hotel ordered us one from the local stand. The driver had a 'selective' english vocabulary and blatantly took us to the wrong train station which cost twice what it would have done had he taken us to the correct one (we asked for the Zoologischer Garten but he took us to the Hauptbahnof). He ignored the fact we were telling him he was going the wrong way and locked our suitcases in the boot of his car when we refused to pay as he was ripping us off! If we were to go back I would make sure the driver clearly understood the destination so there was no room for excuses, but I guess you will get rogue taxi drivers who make their living ripping off tourists wherever you go in the world. Stay here once and explore the West then go back and explore the East.

Our group booked one double and two triples. The double was fairly pokey but the 10th floor triples were extremely spacious. The triples were described as suites and indeed had a large seating area and a separate kitchen which had a sink, cupboards, fridge & table. However, for some strange reason, the kitchen was devoid of pots, pans & crockery! It was very hot during our stay and the lack of air con was a problem at night, although a large fan was provided. The hotel has a very pleasant lobby, is centrally located, very quiet and extremely good value over the internet at 180 euro per night for a triple room, excluding breakfast. I would definitely pay a bit extra for a triple. Plenty of places nearby to get breakfast for about 7 euro. Overall the staff were friendly, courteous and very efficient. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a good central base in Berlin and a bit of comfort on a modest budget.", "Date": "June 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chesham England", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel Fantastic Value\u201d", "Author": "StuartJG", "ReviewID": "UR5221998", "Content": "Stayed at the Sylter Hof for 3 night Break.Superb location in quiet area, nice people.Great value.

It offers good accommodation for an affordable price. The location is great, within walking distance from the Zoo Bahnhof (about 10 minutes walking) and only 3 blocks from major subway lines. Not to mention the 100 bus that stops right in front of the hotel. I stayed at one of their suites in 2006. The bedroom, bathroom and kitchen were sparkling clean. The bedroom had three large windows that opened plus a forth one in the kitchen. The kitchen was spacious, much larger than most kitchens in New York City, and it had a stove with an oven and a small refrigerator but no utensils, pans or plates. The staff was very friendly and everyone spoke at least three languages, including English. The hotel also has a Coffee Shop, which serves simple and cheap food. The things I didn\u2019t like about the hotel: 1.Apparently there is no such thing as a non-smoking room. Although I had requested a non-smoking room and was given one in a non-smoking floor with non-smoking signs all over, the smell was overwhelming. From the pillows to the curtains, everything smelled cigarette smoke. It took two days with all the windows open during the day for the smell to go away. By then, all my clothing, even the ones inside the bags, smelled bad. 2.The rooms have no air-conditioning. I stayed there during the winter months, so I didn\u2019t need air-conditioning but I wouldn\u2019t stay there during the summer. The windows are sound proof and the traffic noise from the two large avenues that surround the building were of no concern. However, the noise was quite loud with the windows open.", "Date": "April 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cRex Reuter, I can't thank you enough\u201d", "Author": "deechaToronto", "ReviewID": "UR4897052", "Content": "From check in to check out, I would have to say that I have never experienced a more seamless, professional hotel stay. Upon check-in, we were greeted with the utmost respect, having everything waiting for us - room key (which I should mention was emblazoned with the finest gold), fresh towels, and a personal letter written by Rex himself. Our room was exactly what we ordered, with arguably the best kitchen facilities I have seen this side of the eastern block. The staff provided us a cot at no extra charge and without a hassle. And the bar - words can't express how great it was. The very attractive waitress made it her duty to make sure my friend and I had the best experience possible. The endless choices of drinks and the fabulous clientele (especially the Finns that we met) added to our experience. Rex - you should be proud of your role in making us some of the happiest hotel guests in the world. The service you and your staff provide was worthy of other's emulation.

I had a single room, which some might find small but suited my needs perfectly. The room was very clean and well kept. What I loved most about this hotel was the location. The 100 bus, which takes you past the Reichstag and onto unter den Linden, stops right outside the hotel. Kurfurstendamm (major shopping street) and Bahnhof Zoolischer Garten is about a 15 minute walk. The department store KaDeWe was right around the corner. It was especially handy for the film festival as there were two theatres within walking distance. The breakfast buffet was a little steep at 13 euros a pop, but it was plentiful and I liked it. There is also a resonably priced cafe adjacent to the hotel, a grocery store across the street for self caterers. The staff are very helpful.
