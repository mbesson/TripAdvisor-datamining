And the trains had stopped running by the time we went to bed. This is a small, 60's style hotel with a very small front office and rooms accessed from the outside.

The bathroom was small but had decorator tile and a granite countertop. The king sized bed was quite comfortable. The room also had comfortable furniture and decorator colored walls, and nice bedspreads and bedding. The front desk lady when we checked in was fantastic and so helpful. She called a taxi to take us to the cruise port the next morning. It arrived in less than 5 minutes. The hotel even had maps on the counter showing all the eating establishments in the area. (However, the guy behind the front desk the next morning seem disinterested and not particularly friendly.) The continental breakfast consisted of your typical bagels, pastries, fruits, cereals, etc. as well as coffee and juices. The only place to sit was at several tables on the covered front porch, but we just brought our food up to our room and ate at the nice table in there which was just fine. It may not have been the fanciest hotel in the area, but it was close (walking distance) to everything, and the room itself was not that much different than at the nicer hotels I usually stay at.

Breakfast was great, but perhaps lacked enough seating. Just one word of caution: the very central location of San Diego airport and the honking trains that run through the city meant there was some significant noise from sunrise until close to midnight. The hotel are upfront about this on their website and we knew what to expect, so we have no complaints, but if you are a light sleeper I would perhaps pay the extra for a more expensive hotel that may perhaps have better sound insulation.

GOOD: The location is somewhat convenient as you could walk into the downtown core of San Diego for any night life (15min walk). For anything else, such Old Town, San Diego Zoo, Sea World, you will need to drive, but they are all pretty close. The continental breakfast is actually good and has quite a bit of selection.

Despite other negative reviews about the loud noise of trains, our room was located very close to reception and we didn\u2019t hear anything that would wake us up. Our bathroom was also very nicely stocked with even some Axe gel samples which I found pretty unique. The staff at the front desk is very friendly and accommodating. BAD: Nothing really negative comes to mind. I guess the nearby train tracks could cause grief for some travelers, but we only found it mildly inconvenient more about the fact that we had to wait for passing trains during our walks into downtown (to go across) rather than the noise. We really enjoyed San Diego, with its Old Town and fabulous Mexican restaurants, the gorgeous Balboa Park which reminded us of Seville, Spain, the nightlife downtown and the splendid sunset seen from the Sunset Cliffs where the sun came down from clouds and then vanished gloriously into the horizon.

However, I list it as a con as a quiet restful sleep is important to most travellers. - The air conditioner was very old and as loud as a Ford diesel truck engine. - The housekeeping staff never smiled, always had a tired disinterested, look on the faces, making us wonder if they were treated well.

Only a two mile drive drive up Pacific Hwy to MCRD. The Marriott, it's not. But at a reserved price of $75, it's a really good deal. I'd definitely say that the Pacific Inn & Suites are a good go between upper end (Marriott) and budget (Motel 6). The rooms were remodeled with brand-new pillow top beds and the carpet was fresh and new. I needed to use the Wi-Fi for some business and it was free of charge.

One of the two women behind the counter (I believe it was Vicky, the manager) suggested we go to the pool area. Which we did. It was great! We met some other parents with their son graduating up the road. The down side is that parking is a bear and can get full quick (especially on busy nights). I suggest getting there early in the evening and parking. Downtown/Gaslamp is a short trolley ride. And the complaints are true about the train that passes through twice a night. Light sleepers should get a room towards the front. It's not anything that the hotel can do anything about and is something you will have to deal with if you stay along that line. Also, there's no convenience stores close by so if you plan on having snacks/beverages in your room, pick them up before you settle in for the night.

At the Reservation Desk we met Sherrie, who was very pleasant, helpful and understanding (her grandmother is about my mom's age, so she knows what it is to travel with an elderly parent). Sherrie got us checked in and even though our room was not ready yet, she allowed my mother to use the facilities in another room. Again, Sherrie was very accomodating to the elderly. After a great lunch at a restaurant nearby, we got settled in our suite, which was neat, clean and cool, as it was extremely hot that day. Sherrie gave us perfect directions to get to the San Diego Zoo, and directions on how to get back to the Hotel that night. Later, the evening staff gave us directions to Old Town so we could get a Mexican meal for dinner that night. The next morning we had a great hot breakfast there at the Hotel and again, Sherrie gave us directions to Sea World with directions on how to get back to the Hotel from the park.

I got the feeling that he spoke to me this way because I was a woman... he did not speak to my husband rudely when my husband came to the lobby to find out what was going on. The reason we chose this hotel was because we were traveling with our two (elderly & well behaved) dogs. What a mistake. The room was filthy. I spent both nights sleeping with a hooded sweatshirt, sweatpants, gloves and socks so I wouldn't have to touch the sheets. The bathroom was a disgrace with old, stained towels. I would highly recommend that you do more investigating than I did when trying to find a pet-friendly hotel in San Diego, CA.", "Date": "January 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "huntington beach, ca", "Title": "\u201cworst jacuzzi suite ever\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4072240", "Content": "It is not worth your money....i specifically asked for a non smoking room and i got a room that smelled like an ash tray. they only show you pictures of the jacuzzi because the room looks like trash.

We stayed here on August 20th and were highly disapointed. I had reserved the room by calling the motel directly, and was assured a rate of $129.00. When we arrived and checked in, the price had gone up to $139.00. I told them what I was quoted and they insisted that they would never have quoted that. A complete lie! After leaving the office, another person who had checked in asked me what I had paid, because they felt they had been ripped off. They paid $269.00 for the same room! The motel was old and run down. The walls actually were smeared with dirt on the inside. The bathroom had tons of mold and the towels were old and dingy. The soap provided was the cheapest quality you could offer. They did not offer shampoo in a little bottle, but a TACO BELL type packet. All staff that worked there were completely rude and did not even care if you were unhappy. The soda and snack machine on the premises were completely empty. The only good thing I could say about this motel was the location. Would never recommend this motel to anyone.", "Date": "August 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tucson", "Title": "\u201cBad Hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3621868", "Content": "I booked way in advance for a 10 day stay and got the rate specified on the website.

After one day we realized 10 days here will really ruin our vacation. I gave them 48 hours advance notice I'll be checking out early and so they doubled the price of the room. We were so ready to leave we paid the extra money and booked the Holiday Inn on the Bay. That stay was cheaper and better. And the Holiday Inn is a better location. The only good thing was the very friendly guy at the front desk. If I was just staying one night I would stay there.

Although they found another hotel for us, it was a nightmare: Way of in hotel circle (about 5 miles), the manager did not care about who had to pay the cab and bring us there, this other hotel was a dump.
