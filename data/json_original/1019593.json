You need not venture fare to get to the Blue Mosque, Grand Bazaar, Spice Markets etc. The hotel is clean, has free wifi at the lobby (at time of visit), a rooftop restaruant with good view of the city, but is a bit older.

I was in a single room that was very small and a little cramped but clean enough. The breakfast was basic. Beware of pre-paying for this hotel through online agencies... There was another couple that had to fully pay for their stay again. Reception also was very reluctant to help me with a prepaid transfer I had organised with them but finallly after an argument they followed up. Wifi was not working at the time.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kendal, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood location - average hotel\u201d", "Author": "icemandan", "ReviewID": "UR108698253", "Content": "Excellent location on the tram line with Topkapi, Agia Sophia and Galata Bridge within easy walking distance and plenty of shops and eating and drinking places close by. Rooms a bit shabby with plug sockets hanging out and strange smells. Some noise at night as one would expect on a main street in a big city. Breakfast ok with some nice breads. No sign of the roof terrace referred to in older reviews. Breakfast was served in a rather dingy windowless basement.", "Date": "May 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNice staff and frienly hotel\u201d", "Author": "MartenZoet", "ReviewID": "UR36967291", "Content": "This nice and friendly hotel has spacious rooms and is located near the Top Kapi, and a lot of other famous buildings in the city centre on the European side of the Bosparus. The hotel is easy to reach with the tram (also from the airport with one transfer from subway to the tram) with the nearby stop called 'Sirkeci'. The rooms are spacious and clear with fresh sheets. Only the rooms on the street side could be a bit noisy, also because the tram goes strait by. The staff is very helpful. The free WLAN is not on every floor accessible but in the lounge does it a great deal. The views from the rooftop are great! The breakfast is also served out there.. I stayed in Kafkas Hotel on the way to a backpacking trip in the Levant . On the way back I stayed there again.", "Date": "August 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Zurich, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cRecommended for short-term budget travelers\u201d", "Author": "katsuhh", "ReviewID": "UR23143166", "Content": "It is convenently located in the center of the Old Istanbul (right on the tram line).

The cleanness of the room was just adequate. However, I had been bothered by the noise coming from the reception, lobby, and corridor.
