The bad: This is the second time I've stayed at a Doubletree Hotel and I'm noticing a trend that their level of service leaves something to be desired. Upon arriving I was informed that the only parking they had available was \"Valet Parking\" - essentially paying $40 a day to have a guy drive my car a few yards in a tiny lot adjacent to the hotel. I informed the front desk that I had paid much less to park the last time I stayed in Boston. The staff member rudely insisted that \"I must not have stayed Downtown\" and said that the cost was reasonable because I was traveling with others and could split it.

About the only negative is the pricing in the restaurant and there is no dining in the immediate vicinity other than Dunkin Donut or McDonalds. Also no convenient store close by so make sure to have what you need with you. Most rooms do have a mini fridge FYI.

The rest of the room was spot on - The Beds (vital) were excellent, the lined and bedding was first class. We had planty of space, a lovely large TV and the bathroom was more than adequate. The cleaning staff were excellent - extremely friendly and effective. I used the bar twice, on both occassions the service was relaxed and friendly, within a few minutes you found yourself engaged in conversation with the staff and other guests.

Plenty of people eating the full version seemed to have a great relationship with the chef who was cooking to order.

He was helpful with everything, little tips about the city, things to do etc. Based on that expereience alone, the hotel is more than worth it!!

Every five minutes there were ambulances going by blaring their sirens. Tufts Medical Center is directly across the street. Finally at about 3am I had to get up and put makeshift toilet paper ear plugs in my ears which only helped slightly.

My room was located in the older portion and you could hear the creaking floor as soon as you crossed from newer to the older portion, and the noise from the floor wasn't any better in my room. The room was a good size and very clean but it was lacking on style and in need of renovations to replace old fixtures, carpet, fridge, and furniture. The internet worked great in the room for a charge of $12.95 a day per device, so that is $25.90 for the internet on your phone and computer. The location was very close to the Tufts Medical Train stop on the Orange line. Directly outside of the hotel was the Tufts Medical campus which surrounded the Doubletree hotel.

Finding a hotel in Boston was harder than I expected. That's why when I found a great deal ($158/night) on this hotel in downtown Boston, I was very excited. The hotel's location was fantastic. We were able to walk everywhere -- Fanueil Hall, the Prudential Center, the Freedom Trail, the Seaport District. If we were tired and didn't feel like walking, it was so easy to take the T back to the hotel. The orange line is down the block, and the green line is only about 3 blocks away. I usually hate taking public transportation to the airport, but it was only 6 stops on the T, which makes taking a cab seem absolutely ridiculous. The room was a good size for a hotel in a major city, but it was not very well-maintained. There was evidence of water damage on the ceiling and scuff marks on the walls and bedsham. Still, the room was neat and clean. We did not hear much street noise. We did not use the hotel bar or restaurant because we preferred to be out and about in Boston, but we did have breakfast at the Starbucks one morning, which was very convenient. We did not drive to Boston, so I can't complain about the price of parking. I kind of think that if you insist on bringing a car to a major city, you waive your right to complain about the price of parking. If it upsets you that much, there are plenty of other garages within a short walk if you want to comparison shop. The hotel does not have a gym, but guests can use the adjacent YMCA free of charge. At first I thought this was lame, but once I actually went I was happy to have a whole gym at my disposal rather than some crappy old machines in a tiny cramped room. The people at the YMCA are so nice, it made working out a part of our trip instead of just being something that we had to get out of the way in the morning.

I walked all over the city and was never really far from home. The second feature for me was the staff. The front desk folks that I dealt with on both weekends were very friendly - and I was impressed that depsite what looked like a busy weekend at the hotel, they actually remembered my name as I passed by occasionally. Their 'welcome' greeting seemed genuine (not scripted) and they were attentive to my needs. I took advantage of the breakfast as well, which was fine, and again, the wait staff were friendly and welcoming. A couple of things that I did not like: A tray from room service sat outside a room for a good 12 hours. One elevator was down on both weekends (a part was on order, so the sign said).

Some rooms have much nicer views than others. The ground floor has the main and side entrances, a small bell desk, and stairs and an elevator to get to the first floor, where the lobby is located. The first floor has the lobby (with an aquarium), check-in desks, concierge desk, restaurant, and meeting rooms. There are two elevators for guest floors. On my first day, one was broken, but was repaired later that day. After it's repair and tune-up, it was nice and speedy, but the other elevator was extremely slow. My room, a deluxe king, was reasonably-sized with one window, which actually opened (nice to be able to turn off the a/c and have fresh air). The bed is the Hilton Serenity bedding, which is very comfortable. Next to the desk is a small table with Hilton's standard Wolfgang Puck coffee makers, which can make tea if you swing the basket out of the way. I appreciated that the coffee maker was in the main room instead of the bathroom. The room also had a refrigerator (not a mini-bar) which is a nice touch and very handy. The bathroom is small, but with ample counter space. There was no tub (which I don't mind) but rather a small stall shower. The bath amenities are Citron, in my opinion much nicer than Hilton's standard standard Crabtree & Evelyn (which I find way over-perfumed). The building is old, with creaky floors, but the hotel is functional and pleasant. The hotel is conveniently located, a short walk to parks, restaurants, and shops.

Let me start off with the good: 1) The staff are extremely friendly. Everyone made it a point to say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hello\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good morning\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good night\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and they did it with a genuine smile. The concierges were awesome! They always opened the door for me and gave me perfect directions when needed. 2) The hotel is adjacent to the Wang YMCA, and as a guest in the hotel you get full access to the YMCA \u00e2\u20ac\u201c cardio and weight equipment, pool, basketball court, outdoor track, and even their classes. 3) The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Doubletree Bed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Doubletree has the most comfortable beds in the hotel industry, in my opinion! 4) The hotel is less than a minute walk from the orange line subway, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also within an easy walking distance to Chinatown, Downtown Crossing, Boylston Street, Back Bay, North End, etc. Okay, now it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for the bad/ugly\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 1) The hotel is in desperate need of a renovation. I mean, DESPERATE need. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at nicer budget motels and hostels. Doubletree\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website indicates that the hotel has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153elegantly appointed guestrooms and suites with an impressive array of in-room amenities.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Elegantly appointed? The furniture in our room didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even match, and the carpet looked like 80s casino carpet. Everything was old and dingy looking. Impressive array of in-room amenities? Are they referring to their 27-inch tube televisions? Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get me wrong, I have no problem with a hotel having tube televisions instead of flat screens, but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t claim to have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153elegantly appointed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rooms and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153impressive in-room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd amenities. 2) The elevators are soooooooooooo s\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6l\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6o\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6w\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 My room was on the fourth floor, and after the first day I realized that it was easier and quicker to take the stairs. 3) As a Gold Hilton Honors member I was entitled to a free breakfast every morning of my stay. Their complimentary breakfast for HHonors members is quite pathetic. You are only entitled to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cold\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd items \u00e2\u20ac\u201c breads, pastries, fruit, and cereal. If you want anything on the hot breakfast buffet you have to pay $5 extra. I could have stayed at any Hampton Inn or Holiday Inn and gotten a free breakfast WITH hot breakfast items. This is the first Doubletree that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever stayed at (and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at others both domestically and internationally) that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allow you their full breakfast.

Pay for two days and get on and off wherever you like, whenever you like. Great way to see a City and learn about it's history and secrets. (we'd used this tour company in New York as well and later in San Francisco, probably the best of any of those kinds of tours). We also felt comfortable using the subway and did so often. It's an easy system to use, cheap and efficient. Harvard was amazing. Always wanted to go there and it was as I imagined - beautiful old buildings that just reek of history and the famous people who studied there over the centuries.

My connection got dropped constantly\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.I hate to belabor this or to parrot other reviewers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 comments but there really does seem to be an issue with parking lot noise in the early morning hours.

I expected the same thing at the Doubletree Downtown Boston when I was in town on a business trip in January 2011. I was deeply disappointed. To make a long story short: I was told that I would be charged one price during my stay but was in fact charged another that was significantly higher. Hotel management politely dismissed my concerns and insisted that I had to pay the higher price. Subsequent attempts to resolve the situation after the fact have proven futile. I am deeply frustrated by Doubletree's unwillingness to listen to my concerns or to resolve the situation.

It was freezing out that day but everything was nice and close and walking distance from the hotel, it is also located right next to the train station. I went to some very nearby bars; I highly recommend The Liquor Store and Gypsy Bar. For restaurants, Fire and Ice was so fun and the Melting Pot. There were lots of places to grab dessert late at night too. A fun place to go is Jacques Cabaret - Google it! \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6also caught a show of the Rocketts!

I got the hotel for about $95 after taxes/fees on Hotwire. We checked-in with no problems at about 3:30 on a Sat. They were nice at check-in but where was my cookie? Is it because we booked through Hotwire? Not a huge deal but I always thought the cookie was a nice touch...if you get one. Our room was in the back corner on the 4th floor. We did not get asked for a bed preference and ended up with 2 full size beds. Not a big deal again but we would have preferred a King or a Queen. The room was clean which was the most important thing but it could use a couple updates such as a flat screen TV. I thought the bed was very comfortable but my wife said she did not sleep well. Also, as what seems to be a increasing trend in hotels there was no electronic safe. Other than that the room was a pretty standard hotel room. One of the two big negatives was it was pretty noisy. For a change I heard no hall noise, or much from the hospital next door, but you could hear a lot of other outside noise. We were on the 4th floor and you could hear people talking on the sidewalk! You couldn't hear what they were saying but I could hear them while I was laying in bed. Also, the city was clearing the sidewalks from a dusting of snow the night before and you would have thought we were on the bottom floor, not the 4th. It was really loud, enough to wake me up and I am a pretty sound sleeper. The other negative was the room thermostat was the old knob style that didn't seem accurate. The room was very warm even when it was turned down. We did not visit the restaurant, bar, or any other facilities so I cannot comment on that. The location of the hotel is pretty decent, it is just over a block from the theater district so it is convenient. There are a couple T stops right there and several restaurants in that area. No complaints there and it would be a good for those with 'good location' up near the top of their list of hotel requirements. So overall it was not terrible but it could be better. A few upgrades and better soundproof windows and I would rate it higher.

The receptionist was very welcoming and when we checked in she gave us 2 warm chocolate chip cookies, which made me very happy. Haha. I was surprised by the room b/c it was quite spacious. It had plenty of room to store 2 suitcases and not trip over them. The hotel is nice but not perfect, it does not have a new hotel look nor do the rooms, but I have to say the bed was very comfortable. And most important of all, the sheets were squeaky clean, pure white and neatly ironed. Just the way I like it. Plus, the room was quiet and I could sleep very soundly.

Boston Common is a few blocks away. Further up on Washington there are stores, restaurants, and some historic landmarks such as The Old State House/Boston Massacre site and Old Meeting House which is part of the Freedom Trail. The only thing that upset me at the hotel was on the 2nd floor, where you have your breakfast. The line was long for no apparent reason. There were about 5 empty spots at the bar and the people just kept on piling up confusingly. So I had to walk through the crowd to ask the waitress what was going on and if we could sit at the bar. She said that was fine. So what was the problem here? I was not sure. I went to get breakfast; there were no plates or forks. Later, I sat down at the bar with my breakfast and I asked for a fork, nothing. I walked up to the register where I could see clean forks and spoons and I asked the waitress to please hand me a fork, she picked it up and walked right by me. Hmm. I was confused myself by this point. So I just reached in and took the fork myself and sat myself down to have breakfast before heading out. The breakfast staff certainly needs some organizing b/c it was so scatter brained. Regardless of the breakfast incident, I would stay here again since the price was appropriate for a good location and I could relax in peace.

It's a fair walking distance to Boston attractions like Boston Common, Public Garden, Cheers, and the Freedom Trail. And if you do have to venture out further, it's nice to know that a T Stop (orange line) is only footsteps away. Chinatown is also like a block and half down the street so trust me, you will be covered when it comes to food unless you want to try the hotel restaurant. Speaking of which, I wasn't crazy about their offerings. Nothing special and if you want the breakfast buffet, be prepared to shell out $25. I didn't have any so I couldn't tell you if it was worth it. Allow me to interject what another reviewer mentioned as \"city noise\" with this hotel. How on earth can you book a room in a hotel's downtown location in a major city like Boston and not expect the same noise you get from any other busy, thriving, metropolis in the heart of downtown? The fitness center they refer to actually belongs to the YMCA next door but it's free to hotel guests. You even have a special elevator that will take you between facilities so you don't even have to deal with YMCA front desk. The access is via rooftop where you will find a running/walking track to use if you want. The fitness center itself has a basketball court and free weights but keep in mind, they are not managed by the hotel. So if for some reason, the YMCA has something going on and you don't have access to something, then you will just have to deal with that. The business centers were alright. One on the main level and another on the 6th level with 2 workstations each. Parking is valet only and it's a rip-off $38. But one has to wonder why you would need one when this location is easy walking access to Boston's main attractions with T-stop next door. Even if you were to cab it, going to Fenway Park or Boston Harbor and back will cost you less than it would to park here for one night.

The rooms are nice, maybe a little small but between us we had three rooms: one nice-sized, a smaller one with a stunning view of the city skyline, and a junior suite. The suite isn't anything special so don't waste the extra dollars to upgrade--- it's really just a regular room with a little more space and a lot of wasted space on the entryway.

We walked to the YMCA to observe a day care worker disciplining a group of little campers right next door to the pool, and so decided to skip the pool experience. What a disappointment! Also to note, when we checked in, the man at the desk was not well-suited to the hospitality business. He barely looked up from his computer/desk as though he was afraid to make eye contact. He perfunctorily checked us in, plopped two paper wrapped cookies on the counter as our welcome, and said nothing. No \"have a good stay\", \"let me know if you need anything\" no nothing! We were not comfortable asking him questions, although later we had to ask for more linens, as the room had been supplied for only one person, and he immediately sent more.

The parking lot attendants and bellmen were helpful and polite. We did express our concerns to the manager, who was very kind and refunded the cost of our two bar drinks. He assured me that the website would be changed to say that guests have ACCESS to a pool - not that the hotel HAS a pool. We'll see if that actually happens..

The room overlooked the parking lot and the echo from the street into the interior parking courtyard was immediately evident. You could also see the emergency room from across the street and it didn't take much to imagine how loud it would be if the ambulances had an emergency. We asked to change rooms. The front desk was cooperative and switched us to Room 262. We were told this room was much quieter because it was closer to the YMCA. The noise was slightly quieter, but not much. I wanted to change rooms again, but my husband thought we should give it a try. Huge mistake. We're not light sleepers and despite being extremely tired, the street noise woke us up with less than 4 hours of sleep. To make matters worse, it wasn't until the next morning that I realized that the shower stall in this room was filthy. (Only one bar of soap in this bathroom by the way.) There was mold and mildew in the corners. The water pressure in the shower was non existent and the plastic shower head was so clogged that the water came out in a dribble. I'm near sighted so I didn't realize the shower was so gross until I put my glasses on to see what was up with the shower head with so little water coming out. I was appalled and took a photo on my camera to show the front desk. We asked to change rooms. The front desk staff was extremely apologetic and they told us to pack our luggage and have it ready in our room. They would move us to a new room later in the day when more rooms came available. They'd have the key ready for us with the new room number at the end of the day when we came back from sightseeing. When we returned to the room later that evening, our room had not been changed and we were told the hotel was sold out and that there was nothing that could be done. We spoke to a manager who apologized for the breakdown in communication of his staff, but said there was nothing there were no other rooms available. He said he could comp us for some items on our bill, as if that would make things all better. I showed the night manager the digital photo of the shower and told him that the room should never have been assigned. We had a wedding to go to the next day and I told him I refused to use the shower in its present condition. He said he didn't have a room to change us to until the next day and that the best he could do was send someone from maintenance to work on the shower. I agreed to the shower being worked on at that late hour (after 11pm) and said that I still wanted to change rooms. He said to keep our bags packed and the room would be changed the next day while we were out. The following day we were finally moved to another room on the 5th floor. It was as if we were in another hotel. The bathroom was clean, we had a shower/tub combo, the shower head was metal and we had excellent water pressure. We actually got two bars of soap for the bath room and we even had two more Neutrageana toiletries that were not in our previous room. The room was still on the street side, but with it being higher up the street traffic was more like background noise instead of like you were sleeping on the street. This room was definitely more acceptable and we're sorry we didn't have this room sooner. If we hadn't pre-paid for the hotel stay in advance we would have found some place else to stay. The pre-raid rate was only $20 less that the rack rate so we didn't get a particularly good deal on the hotel. If we had the room on the 5th floor for the whole stay it would have been worth it, but we didn't. Other comments: Evening bartender was extremely rude. Had an excellent server all three days for breakfast. When calling for Room Service, the call went into voice mail multiple times and they didn't retrieve messages. It wasn't until them finally answering the phone that the order was taken. Food was ok. 5th floor much cleaner and nicer than the 2nd floor. Carpet everywhere needed to be cleaned. No chocolate chip cookies If it weren't for the 5th floor room, the overall review for this hotel would have been Terrible.

TV was large and there was a coffee and tea maker in the room. Also the view was great from our room.

We obtained the room through Priceline (our winning bid was $51, and with various taxes and service charges, the total bill was nearly $70). The timing of the visit did not allow us to make use of any of the hotel amenities. The hotel is located in a relatively urban part of downtown Boston; not unsafe in any way, but not especially charming, either. Chinatown and public transportation are all within easy walking distance. There's a Starbucks right next to the hotel lobby; a McDonalds is about 200 yards down the street to the left. To drop off luggage, you must enter a small open parking lot, and it's not immediately clear where you should go. There is no doorman on site; he is stationed inside at a location where he can monitor foot traffic. When he showed up later, he asked me, \"Can I help you, man?\" (Have I traveled back to 1972?) Complaint: Parking for the hotel is \"valet only\" - a bit of false advertising, since the \"valet\" is a virtually incomprehensible guy sitting in a tiny booth who seemed extremely reluctant to leave and come out into the cold (who could blame him; it was 8 degrees F). The parking cost is $36, and the lot is not covered or protected. This is totally unacceptable. TIP: Go across the street and park in the underground, secure (and on this cold January night ... warm!) parking lot associated with the medical center. The cost (for a visit of less than 12 hours) was $14, rather than $36 for the open, unguarded \"valet\" parking. It's $28 for a full day. The lobby was clean and uncluttered, though there's a bar rather incongruously located just to the left of the check-in area. Our check-in clerk was extremely pleasant and efficient. The room was clean, and sufficiently spacious, with a king-size bed, a desk, small sofa, and in-house Wolfgang Puck coffee. The bed was above average in comfort. The alarm clock time was off by one hour, and there was no way to correct the time! The bathroom was large enough for two adults to be inside at the same time. Other commentary on this hotel has been mixed. From my perspective, at the price we paid and given its location, we were very happy with the deal we got. Use it as a base for traveling around town, because of the access to public transportation. Use it if you've got business at the medical center.

That's the feeling I got on each of my four days at the hotel. FIRST AND FOREMOST -- IT'S NOT in a great area. It's across from the medical center -- so if that's your destination, great! But if you are hoping to walk to anything except some awful Chinese take-out places, avoid this location. If you read all the reviews of this hotel, you will be left with the impression that management really does not care to make things good for its guests. That's EXACTLY the same impression I got. Here are some problems I experienced. . . 1. Internet access is terrible. EXTREMELY SLOW -- LOTS OF DISCONNECTS. Terrible! The hotel should be ashamed to charge $300.00 per month ($10.00 per day, plus tax) for this lousy service. 2. Front desk help is hit or miss. One agent that works nights (Julia I think) not only provided terrible directions, she was clearly bothered by the questions I asked. For example, when I asked if there was a close convenience store, she said \"just make a left and you will see CVS.\" She failed to say it was a half-mile away. An important point when it's 11 degrees and windy outside with half a foot of snow. So after walking a few blocks we turned around and came back wondering where it was. . . .then the front door man told us it was quite a ways up the road. That we needed to keep walking several more blocks. 3. Maid service provided ONE bar of soap in the bathroom. We had to move it back and forth from shower to sink. Figuring the next day we would get more soap. NOPE! No new soap after housekeeping made up the room. So we had to call the front desk. 5 minutes later maintenance appeared at the door and had no idea what we needed except that he got a call to come to our room. It took a while, but finally we got another bar of soap. We never got another bar of soap during our 4-day stay. 4. Carpet was stained and poorly patched in many places. Additionally I needed to move the night table out from the wall to plug in my laptop and was disgusted with the garbage on the floor behind the night table left there by previous guests. 5. We had requested a room with a microwave oven. It wasn't there on check in. When I called for one, they sent up the oldest dented dirty microwave oven I have ever seen. It was an early 1980's model that took 6 minutes to reheat coffee and 10 minutes to make a cup of water hot enough for tea. Additionally, all the numbers and words were rubbed off so it took a while to figure out whether you are cooking on high or low. 6. The bar is an embarrassment. My wife and I were interested in a glass of red wine. The selection was not only awful (two reds available by the glass), they were terribly cheap wines. Yet, they were charging $9 and $11 per glass. These were the wines that cost $6.99 and $8.99 a bottle at any liquor store. Overall the condition of our room and the overall impression with this hotel was closer to a Motel-6 than a typical Doubletree. The hotel is in desperate need of a renovation.

Check in was great and we were each given a warm freshly baked chocolate chip cookie to welcome us to the hotel. That gave us a very good impression of the hotel. The rest of our two day stay was good and uneventful. However the trouble came on the last day before we were to check out. When we checked in, the front desk staff gave us a late check out till 1pm when the originally time was 11am. Because of the late checkout, my friend and I were able to check out Harvard in the late morning and came back to the hotel around 12noon. When we tried to go into our room using our room card, we were locked out. However, our other friends from the other room had no trouble and were able to go into their room using their room card. My friend and I head to front desk for assistance and informed them of our trouble. We informed them that we had a late check out till 1pm and that our room card was not working. The lady who was managing the front desk was not friendly towards us and told us that we were supposed to come down to the front desk at 11am to have our cards extended if we have a late check out. However, that does not make sense because our friends from the other room (who also had a late check out) was able to use their card without any trouble. Next, we enquired whether it was possible for them to extend our card for us so that we can open the room and get our luggage for checkout and they say that they were unable to do so. This is because the room was not checked in under our names. One of our friends checked in both rooms on our behalf and she happened to be out for lunch and not back yet.

All she told us was that we cannot go into the room and she did not offer any other solutions for us. In the end, she consulted her supervisor and after more explanations, the supervisor gave us new room cards and allowed us to enter the rooms. We understand that the hotel has their own room security regulations and we respect that. However, we felt that the front desk staff can be more friendly and provide solutions to the guests.

Just remember, you are in a city, and like every city, one must be aware. The Doubletree was a great stay this past weekend. We checked in around noon and received our yummy cookies. We had a room on the 3rd floor facing the hospital. (For the record, we heard only 1 siren the entire time we were there.) The room was pretty large, king bed, big windows, fridge, mini bar, desk, no tub, just shower, neutrogena toilet trees in bathroom also. The pool and gym are in the connected YMCA. Just because it wasn't in hotel, it wasn't a burden at all. The lounge has a bar that sits maybe 15. Location.... again, I repeat DO NOT BE HESITANT on booking this hotel. I actually liked the location. Close to Jacob Wirths one of the oldest pubs in Boston. Down the street from Filenes Basement and Downtown Crossings. Shopping everywhere. The Boston Commons (park) was close also. Bring your ice skates in case you want to try the rink. Restaurants everywhere. You name the type of food, and it would be a 3-10 min walk to get there. The service and people at the hotel was great. Absolutely no complaints. Hilton/ Doubletree is a good name and a solid choice when you come to Beantown. Lastly, the weekend that we went every other hotel in the city was well over $200.00, not here.... less than $200. Booked through hotel via. phone. Have a great trip.

When I arrived about 10:40 am, I was told that they had one smoking king room available, I actually booked a smoking king room because that was all they had at the time of my booking but I really wanted a non-smoking room. I was advised that I could check-in into the smoking room now and if I thought it was too bad come back around 3:00pm to see if any non smoking came available. I checked in and went up to room 301, the room had only a very slight hint of smoke but wasn't bad but the room kinda small. I checked out the bathroom and it was big and clean, but since the room was small I called the front desk to ask for another room, they advised me to wait until 3:00pm so I left my things in the room and went exploring downtown crossing. I got back at exactly 3pm and went to the front desk to change my room, I was told that only one non smoking king was available 621 so I took it. Went up to the room and the business center is right down from it, the room was clean and a very nice size much much bigger than the one on the 3rd floor. I had requested a microwave for $5 extra/night and it was on top of the small table with the coffe maker and cups, next to that was a desk and a computer chair. There was 27in TV, in the closet were sleepers and a terry cloth robe. The bathroom in this room was small compared to the one on 3rd floor but it was big enough. I was very happy with this room, the bed was extremely comfortable with many pillows. The staff was very helpful and go out of there way to make you comfortable.

This is inside the Chinatown YMCA and most of the signage was in Chinese which was interesting. Howver, the pool was very disappointing as I booked this hotel based on the pool, which my kids were excited to try.

The insulation is also not very good as you can hear every sink, shower and toilet running whether next to the room or above it.

The linens have been bleached too many times, bring your own pillowcase and bath towels!

It would have been nice if they let us know this upon check-in, as my boyfriend had the stomach flu. Internet is not free. The second floor has two free interenet computers- don't plan on checking in with your airline and printing your boarding pass because the computers dont have the right programs installed. Room service is by far the best thing about the hotel. It is not too pricey, and arrives quick. Oh yes, and the courtyard view lessens the street noise.
