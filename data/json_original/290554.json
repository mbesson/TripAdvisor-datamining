First off the location is excellent, just off the Ramblas at the port end, 30 seconds from the splendour of Placa Real. First impressions on walking into the place were really impressive. The reception is modern and sleek but mixed in with some exposed old brickwork behind modern clean glass. All very well lit and quite striking. There's a glass door through to a bar next door that I assume is owned by the same people and well worth a visit for tapas and a drink. The room (506) was modern, 22\" TV with international channels (BBC1 and ITV1 which was a bonus and meant I could watch Match of the Day), very impressive \"wet room\" with large shower area and modern sink etc. We had a balcony but facing an inner courtyard it wasn't somewhere to spend much time. Only there for 2 nights we didn't have much occasion to bother the staff but they seemed pleasant enough, the room was cleaned as expected and overall I'd recommend the place at the price we paid, which was about \u00a375 a night. Also recommend the restaurant directly opposite, I forget the name but it was big, bustling and really good value. A bottle of Albarino was 14 euro and the most expensive on the list, a steak and chips (not that the Spanish can ever master chips; it's the olive oil you see) was 11 euro. Expect to pay double that and more elsewhere for substandard fare. Having not been to Spain for a few years I must say I was staggered by how the prices have rocketed. Even the most basic plate of tapas is now 3 euro (they used to be free!), with most coming in at 5-7 euro. A glass of local beer (300ml) now routinely costs almost 4 euro. That's about 150% increase on just 5 years ago, in a country where the government take only a fraction of the duty they do in the UK. A vodka coke in a normal bar (inside) cost 7 euro. Again a huge mark up. They're the sort of prices that will probably make me and many others think twice about going back in future, and as Spain teeters on the edge of financial oblivion, the last thing it needs to do is drive away tourists.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Mateo, California", "Title": "\u201cFew frills, but pleasant, modern, and comfortable.\u201d", "Author": "auros", "ReviewID": "UR128149417", "Content": "This was the first hotel my spouse and I stayed in over our honeymoon, and it was a pleasant place to arrive after more than 24 hours of continuous travel (flights from San Francisco to Philadelphia to Madrid, high-speed rail to Barcelona, taxi to hotel).

Our room was comfortable, and the hotel was in a convenient central location relative to many of the places we wanted to visit. One negative point: We both have long hair, and with the towels being somewhat small, we needed a couple extras. The maids seemed determined, on every visit, to take all the towels, and leave us with only two again, even though we were hanging the towels up and a card said that if you hung them they would be left for reuse.

The location was excellent, just off Las Ramblas, towards the bottom end, it really was an ideal starting point for exploring Barcelona. The rooms were clean and although the amenities were very basic, it had everything you would want if you intend to use your hotel as a base. The hotel is fairly recently renovated and this showed in the decor, a quite stylish reception area, a glass lift, and murals on the wall. This is where the positives stop unfortunately. Barcelona in January is fairly mild, however it is still a bit chilly on an evening. The bedding provided was inadequate to say the least, the first night I was cold. The room was supposed to have heating, and there was a control and thermostat for this on the wall. The heating did not work, I mentioned this to the reception for them to pull open a panel, press something on a touch screen and tell us it should now be ok, it made no difference, I complained again and they did the same thing, again, it made no difference. Also there was no hot water, having been on an open top bus for the big chunks of the day we were cold to say the least, having to face a cold shower was not ideal. The last thing worth mentioning was the noise. This didnt really bother me as I knew from the location there would be some. However as we were on the first floor and the street was quite a busy thoroughfare it was very noisy, it only got quite around 6am. It was nothing too bad, people having fun on their way home that sort of thing. If youre the sort of person who likes a bit of peace, then this is not the place for you. In short, the hotel had an excellent location, it was cheap, but if youre going to consider it in the winter months, take thick pyjamas and some ear muffs.", "Date": "January 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location!

Saying this, the first impression was fantastic! Very modern design inside and out, The rooms are everything you need. extremely clean, spacious, equipped with lots of storage, and good lighting. The rooms come with satellite tele, a safe to keep all your valuables (strongly advised), large bathroom with a powerful shower, huge mirrors as well as complimentary toiletries. We stayed in a triple and a twin. The triple was facing the street and although we were partying deep into the night, the noise of midday hustle did not wake us once. The twin room located in the middle of the hotel was silent with the exception of slight hallway noise. Hotel Staff: I could not praise the hotel staff highly enough. They all speak perfect English and any questions we had about the city, local restaurants, or even places to avoid they were more than happy to answer. They are more than welcoming to guests of all ages and are always up for a chat about the stories you have already gathered in your time in Barcelona. Out of courtesy we were even given a book of discount vouchers when asking about some good deals around the city too. The Location: Perfect on the south end of La Rambla, about a 10/15 minute walk in straight line from the Aerobus Bus stop as well as very close to several Metro stops. a taxi rank is perfectly located a few minutes walk away by the monument, however a number of the tourist attractions are within walking distance of the hotel (30/40 minutes) highly recommended with great designer stores and architecture along the way. The port is a stones throw away and is again a great walk along the beach down to some of the best bars and clubs. It's in the heart of all the action - we passed many hotels we were considering before we arrived and on reflection for a decent buzz of night life, good restaurants right outside the door and good transport connections Barcelona House is the only place you'll want to stay. La Rambla is a little seedy in early hours, with a large amount of prostitutes and pick pocketers. However, please do not let this deter you, just keep your valuables in a secure pocket and stay sober enough to stay standing and you'll be fine. As long as you do this, you can just say \"no\" and walk on or stay and have some funny banter with them. The only other thing I would advise is that to stick to main streets at night and not to kick off if you suspect someone has stolen your money. (We saw a group of guys find out the hard way). Tip: Rooms do not come with an iron, although front desk will supply you with one upon request. Only 1 key per room so it's advised to leave it at the front desk each time leaving the hotel.

We liked Rene especially. I chose this hotel based on its pictures which are true to real life. It\u2019s very close to La Rambla (1 min) and Placa Reial (1 min) and Bocqueria (5 min), which means many people walk by all the time. It can be noisy and crowded outside, but from the room, I did not hear the streets at all. Just the people next door (very thin walls). Also, the hotel is very close to the Barri Gothic where you should get lost and explore the small cobblestone streets and charming alleyways. I wished I could have spent more time here. If you venture left from the hotel at night, you might see people selling cans of beer for 1euro. We walked to the left for a bit but decided to turn around because it felt sketchy. No breakfast, but there\u2019s a nice bakery down Carrer de la Ferran (where the McDonald\u2019s is at) called Forn del Pi. The liquor store and markets are just 1-2 minutes away. And there are plenty of restaurants that cater to tourists on La Rambla. I recommend Romesco (which is off the beaten path on Calle Sant Pau, 28) for made-to-order seafood dishes that\u2019s affordable and many locals dine here. My parents went here 3 nights in a row! Complaints: I requested a wake up call one day and didn\u2019t get it the next day (not a good sign, especially if you had to make it to the airport the next morning). Also, my parents were in Room 311 and they could definitely hear the street noises and late night drunkards. Room 311was a decent size but was not enough room for their only one big luggage. They had to somehow place it in the middle of the room and made it a bit tight. Also, the air conditioning did not work properly. They asked the front desk twice about it, in which they responded \u201cwe checked downstairs and it seems to work,\u201d which didn\u2019t.
