Amsterdam is an expensive place, so when we saw the Manofa and how cheap it was.. then we were ready to take it on.. rats an' all! We considered it to be a good laugh to book in here... as a couple of the lads are scared of mice.. so we could have a great time watching them panic... Anyhow.. we stayed 2 nights... not a single mouse to be seen... and obviously there were no rats seen... simply because some of the previous reviewers seem to not know the difference between a mouse and rat. We arrived early in the morning and book in was at 2pm, so we were allowed to leave our bags and head off for a few pints. We booked in on two floors, I was in a room of 3 in room 220, and the rest of our group had a large balcony room on the third floor. The rooms were very dated, but clean enough, the corridors and paintwork is tired and shabby and there are little bits of graffiti around the place.. that makes it feel much more like a hostel than a hotel. The bathroom was clean too, the showers were hot, the rooms were lovely and warm and the beds were really soft and comfy... The lads were bemused with me, as I had promised them a right old rough and ready place with mice scurrying about... but sadly all I had provided them with, was a proper bargain and a comfy stay.. oh and a breakfast thrown in too... a nice bit of cheese and ham went down a treat on a bit of toast. So to summarise... would I put my parents up in this hotel? Well.. no... Would my missus be happy if I took her though... hmm.. maybe.. and would a stag party/hen party enjoy this place that is bang in the best location, but mega cheap to stay... oh yes!

The lock on the room door was very fustrating, had to yank very hard on the door to close it properly so it locked, then put my shoulder into it to open it again.

I was travelling with my elderly mother-in-law, who is an octogenarian and walks with the aid of a walking stick. This meant that we could not really stay in a hotel, which has a lot of stairs, and we definitely wanted one which was quiet and had a no smoking policy. Well, we went to drop off our bags at the reception as we had arrived in Amsterdam earlier than expected. The first thing to greet us was a steep stairway of approximately twenty steps and a very smoky reception. When we returned at the agreed time of 2pm the room was still not ready. But that was the least of our problems. When we were eventually allowed into the room, we discovered it backed onto the main reception area, which as I mentioned earlier was very smoky. So, during our stay we were accompanied by a constant cloud of smoke which appeared to creep from the reception, under our room door and into the contents of the room; the curtains; the bedding; our travelling clothes and of course up our nostrils. Rather unpleasant being non-smokers! We had a couple of nice paintings in the room, which were perched against the wall, rather than hung on the wall, but one picture looked like the scene from a horror movie so we just turned it round! The room lights were not working, so out of courtesy I took the three dead bulbs from the lights to reception, where upon they were replaced. However, my bedside light, which I would use to read, appeared to have an electric fault. The showerhead, instead of allowing the water to come out evenly, spurted out sporadically. To use the loo and the hand basin, although I was able to step over the water, my mother-in-law was forced to walk through a puddle of water. The water was obviously not draining. Throughout the entire night, right up until 8am the following morning, the air conditioning units that were directly outside our window blared out like hair dryers on full power. To top it all, we were deceived and taken advantage of. Elska, who was the female receptionist, told us that the showerhead would be replaced and that the 'technician' was just off to purchase a new one. Little did we realise that both she and the technician were both off duty 20 minutes later, as we were duly informed of by the new male receptionist Walid, who appeared to be very nice but smoked from behind the reception desk the entire time we were there. Walid did offer me no less than three other rooms the following morning, after I told him about our experience. Each of the three other rooms also had problems. Either the curtains did not close fully; the showerhead did not have a bracket (so you could not have a hands free shower) or BOTH! There was absolutely no way I was going to allow us to stay another night. So, I went straight to Lindenburg - the Excursions Booking office, where Pete (a very nice, kind and sympathetic, bespectacled man) helped us enormously. Pete booked us a twin en suite room at the Citadel hotel in Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal 98-100 and we had a much better experience.", "Date": "April 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cRats and poor service, but a decent location\u201d", "Author": "Poonage", "ReviewID": "UR103577120", "Content": "We stayed in a 3-bed room for 3 nights and the room had rats in it.

We checked in on the Friday at 10pm and were given room 303, as we opened the door first thing that hit us was the stench of poo, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not over exaggerating, the room smelt of poo! Which of course isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really the best first impression of the city and our accommodation for the next few nights, especially for my partner it being her first trip! What could only have made it worse is that the window would not open further than a couple of inches! We decided to leave it until the morning until we would say something about our complaint. Saturday morning, I went down and told the reception staff, he assured me he himself would look at it, things seemed promising but he had said right out we would not be able to get a new room! Which I thought was quite unfair as it made you feel very unclean whilst in the room. Getting back Saturday afternoon, hoping our room would be okay, was the opposite, they had come in and cleaned the whole bathroom and sprayed a lot of air freshener but did not solve the problem at all! Continuing with our unhygienic stay, my partner came home with a lot bites and rashes which we believe was a result of something in the bedding! We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let it get us down too much, we had an awesome time because the city is amazing we just went for walks and so didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spend much time in the room.

Bargain! Of course when doing this there is always an element of doubt in your mind when arriving. Knowing Amsterdam and the location of the hotel I wasnt too worried about stairs - so when faced with a room on th 4th floor I wasnt too worried. Arriving in our room, I was a little shocked to see the outdated furniture and TV but was happy to see the bathroom was clean (even with a worrying crack in the sink). I expected the nights to be noisey (being on Damrak) but was pleasantly surprised at how quiet the room was. 3 good nights of sleep! Breakfast was good. All you really needed to start the day - bread, cheese, ham, salami, juice, tea and coffee and cereal. The boiled eggs where a nice surprise and it was nice to see that the staff was attentive to the guests needs - nothing ran out to the point of people having to go without right to the end. This is a trait I have experienced in high class hotels so it was nice to see a 1 star getting it right! I would like to comment on a few issues that could be addressed for improvement: The first being the fact that despite a sign in the reception area stating \"smoking is not permitted in this area\" the staff seemed to enjoy their cigarettes at all hours of the day. I was grateful that the room was non-smoking though. Second, a little handy work on the rooms would do them the world of good - a dash of paint, some new curtains and maybe a new sink. Third - breakfast is good but might be an idea to move the buffet to somewhere not so closed off and dead ended! Or simply place the hot drinks somewhere that people can get to them without affecting the food on the buffet. Heating wouldnt go amiss either! Finally - the mice issue. I know (from living and working in the city) that there are a lot of mice and rodents in most hotels. However, it would only better the service if the mice were dealt with so that you dont have to hear them or see them at any hour of the day.

Had to change rooms every night but as I'm new to hostels will accept as normal and I was allowed to put my bag into whichever room I ended up in.

There was no complaints with noise and you were free to smoke in the room which was handy because you couldn't get alchohol in most cafes. There was loads of people staying there, all friendly enough to talk to, we ended up in some random people from Belfast's room gettin a smoke at 4 in the morning lol. It wasn't the cleanest place I've ever stayed and by far not the dirtiest but when your young and going to Amsterdam I don't think that should be high on the list of priorities. The staff were really helpful, we lost at least 5 keycards and they didint make 2 much fuss bout replacing them. The girl on the desk was helpful with information on getting around and things to do. I wouldn't recommend this for families or anyone who can't go a few days without home comforts but we all found it great and the location was perfect, right on the Damraak : ). If you're young and there for the party this place will definently suit.

After reading the reviews on tripadvisor (after I'd booked the hotel through Easyjet) I was really worried but thankfully, there was no need to be! When we got to the hotel we were given our room keys and were offered a safety deposit box (for 10 euro deposit) which we took. We were also given passes for a free breakfast served every morning from 8-10am but we never made it down on time! We did however get a discount in the restaurant downstairs because we stayed in Manofa. We got upstairs (rooms 307 and 211) and were quite happy at what we saw. The room looked quite clean, even though it was very outdated but this didn't bother us because we were expecting a one star hotel. The stairs up to the room looked at bit mad and dangerous but they didn't cause us any problems. We had a tv with a few good channels like Paramount Comedy, MTV and TMF which came in handy. We also had a phone. The bathroom was really clean and the shower was dead on. We made a good bit of noise and the hotel management said nothing so that was good. We were also able to smoke in the rooms - suprisingly enough the smoke alarms didn't go off when we did?? lol The hotel is in a GREAT location - right beside loads of shops, restaurants and coffee shops and about 5mins from the red light district. It's also right beside the central station and a train to the airport is only 4.30 euros - a taxi is about 40 euros so a train is definitely the better idea! I think I would come back to this hotel as long as I knew that the rooms would be as good as before.

I dont know if Europeans have very very low standards compared to Americans, but this \"2 star\" hotel should not even have been open for business, it was so disgusting and repulsing. The radiator in my room was broken so the rats and the mice would run around my room freely, when I was trying to sleep, they would be scurrying around my head, and when I went to compain about it and change rooms, they said none were available, and that I would have to deal with it that night. After 3-4 nights of already trying to \"deal with it\" there was no way I was going to have a panic attack that mice were attacking both me and my belongings when I sleep. The bed was about an inch off the ground so I might as well be sleeping on the floor, with mice, and many of them. They were noisy and hungry. And when I finally got someone to come look at my room, they had one solution: A RAT TRAP! Like a single rat trap is going to fix a mice infestation. After smoking all day and all night, I want to come back to a hotel I feel secure and safe in. I left at 4-5am that night with all my belongings, traveling alone in the middle of the night in Amsterdam, to find a vacancy at another hotel. I went right down the street to the Hotel Victoria, which was a MUCH MUCH better choice- and about the same price as the Manofa on the weekends- and had a much better stay in Amsterdam. I cant say Im not scarred by my time at the Manofa in Amsterdam. If you want a real crap hole, go here. And a sprial staircase in a million year old building that is infested with mice and your room happens to be on the 5th floor of the building and theres no bellman to help you with your stuff after taking a 12 hour flight and having to leave after you realize the place you reserved a month ago was the biggest bukkah hole in the whole city. After days of complaining, I was unable to even reach a manager (GM) of the hotel, and I was not able to get my money back. I even had to pay for the night I had to leave at 4am to go searching on my own for another hotel with my packed luggage, travelling all alone, because I felt unsafe in the Manofa. DONT EVER GO HERE. EVER. And i also have a permanent scar from the hotel clerk applying alcohol and some other ointment and rubbing it in my deep cut on my leg when shaving in their [--] showers. a PERMANENT 3 inch scar on my leg from an untrained, un-medic, hotel clerk idiot INSISTING that he touch me. As in, grabbing my leg and not letting me go. If I knew anything about European law, I would sue the [--] out of this place.

It was not too bad at first, until you realize that the beds are uncomfortable, the rooms are dirty, there was other peoples hair on the pillows, the bathroom was pretty grimey and didnt even have a mirror. When my girlfriend enquired about the lack of a mirror to the desk guy he didnt really seem to care at all and said he would \"see what he could do\" i knew right then she wasnt getting a mirror!! not a big deal for me but she was a littlte peeved cus she couldnt get ready to go out. But all this was nothing compared to the second night!! There are signs all over the hotel saying \"no food in the rooms\" this is because the hotel is infested with mice and they will come into our rooms to get the food!! I was just falling into a blueberry haze dreamland when my girlfriend grabbed me by the arm and screamed \"theres something in the room!!\" sure enough there was a little mouse crawling across the bed, and it had been in my girls purse where she had forgotten she had some potato chips in there...we called the front desk to tell them there was a mouse in the room and they were pretty much nonchalant about the whole thing, all he said was \"oh...\"so we switched rooms to a different room at 3 in the morning, and when we got to the new room surprise, no sheets on the bed and it smells like someone just smoked a massive bob marley spliff in there...i went back up to my old room, and took the sheets and pillows and I had to set up the new room by myself!! Really good service for 105 euros a night huh!? I finally was just about to fall asleep when again there is a mouse in this room too!! there was also some kind of cabinet built into the wall that had a hole in the top of it and when you looked in all you could see was garbage and used condoms!! sweet!! needless to say i wasnt sleeping another night in this dump. I went to find a new place at 5 in the morning walking around by myself and found a much nice place for a much more affordable price! Then when i went to ask for a refund at Manofa (we had booked 3 nights in advance but stayed one night and then didnt get much sleep the next night with the mice and all that) the guy at the desk said he would have to wait for his boss...anyway we ended up getting back the money for the last night that we didnt stay on but i feel we should have been compensated for the second night with the rodents and room changing and all that....anyways i would not recommend this dump to my worst enemy!!

Cobwebs and spiders all over the ceiling. There was no toilet roll or towels in the bathroom. Then half an hour after check in while I was in the middle of getting changed, there was a knock on the door and without waiting enough time for anyone to get to the door to open it, a man lets himself into the room with the toilet roll and towels! The towels I could not bring myself to use and went out to buy some. The pillows were not only half the normal size of a pillow but so thin it was hardly worth bothering with and the 'duvet' was about as useful as the pillows.

Amstrdam is wonderful, you can walk al the city or better, rent a bike. The places are very close to each other and flat so it is easy to ride bikes. Manofa is a little hotel like the others. Rooms are relly small. This is the typical problem. All the buildings are seriously small, you can wash your hands one by by. The room dosen't exist a bathroom. But thankfully my boyfriend requested the hotel for a room closer to the bath room and they gave us the closest room. Thanks for that. Rooms are really small, beds are not so clean, but really very big. When you enter the room, the bed is all of the room. You can barely move in the room with the luggages. The only bed thing was the breakfast. It was prepared at some diner place under the hotel. There wasn't much thing to eat, we thought that staying in a only bed hotel was a better idea than bb. Besides there are lots of nice places for coffe, waffles and some other kind of eateries on the main street of Manofa. Damrak is the most central place in Amsterdam. So location of hotel was great.

As most small hotels in Amsterdam it was quite narrow and the hallways and stairs suffered from that. Small and narrow. The rooms were OK, but smelled kind of funky, a weired mixture of alcohol and old socks... Another thing was that there were almost no light in one of the rooms, probably because most of the light bulbs were disappeared.... In one of the lamps we also found a small bag of \"something\", perhaps magic mushrooms or an old space cake. Apart from this the rooms seemed to be just fine! Except for the mouse and rats of course, we heard them every night, but we never saw them. When we looked beneath the wardrobe we saw a lot of mouse crap which did not look very nice. But the room had no mouse holes or any other small holes so I doubt that those small [-] could get in to the room itself, they keep in the walls. The best thing about the hotel was the location, close to the red light district, central station and dam square. The price was also very good, we paid 515 euro for five persons for three nights. The worst things were the smelly rooms which seemed to be out of air every morning, even with open windows and the missing light bulbs during the whole stay.

The only bizarre thing in our room was the big step up from the bedroom into the toilet, it was around 12 inches in height so if you have had a few beers watch it!. The breakfast was a bit of a disappointment even for a Euro buffet. Usual fare of cold meats and cheese etc. Rolls were in plastic toy boxes and were quite heavy and as other reviewers pointed out, you had to take pot luck with the coffee as it was served up in a carafe and went like lightening. We didn't get any. Also, what food there was soon ran out and wasn't replaced so if you have had a bit of a late night you were going to be out of luck. At 10 o'clock everything was cleared away in an instant. Still, I guess we couldn't complain too much for 25 euro's. The hotels big plus point is it's location.

After booking this hotel i found this site and started reading all the reviews before i went on holiday, and was totally regretting my purchase. It got so bad that even one of my friends threatened no to go as these reviews were so bad. Anyways we managed to convince him to come. I went with 4 friends(all male and under 20)and as it was the first time we were all on holiday without parents, we were a bit anxious. When we stepped off the train at Central Station we realised none of us actually knew where the hotel was. We traveled down most of the main roads and found the hotel after about 40 minutes. (Its not far at all just go left when you go out the front doors and walk down the biggest road.) When we got to the reception, all though everything was fine with the booking, both receptionists that were working at the time were very moody and were not at all helpful or cheerful. Turned out our room was on the top floor(I think it was 415). The hike up the stairs takes it out of you and especially when full of beer. The room itself was alright, everything was clean and spacious and although there was 5 of us we had six beds, dont know why???? The view from our window showed the entire Damrakk, good spot for smoking a joint just as you go to bed. The room looked like it had just been given the quickest of coats in the most horrible orange colour. Toilets are very small and for some reason on the top floor one toilet can be used by both males and females and another can be used by just females. I took 2 poos in the girls toilets as i didnt see why they should be any different from us blokes. The showers are a bit unpredictable sometimes cold, but if you get in when they are warm its nice a bit of mould on the ceiling and try to take the least amount of things into the showers with you as puddles collect on the floor. Its safe to say that i dont think that there was any bed bugs as i didnt feel any bites and have come away spot free. However like the previous reviewer stated there are mice. We didnt notice them the first 3 nights, but the first night that i didnt drink alcohol i was kept up till about 6 'o clock. Heard some rustling near the bin, switched on the light and there were two mice on the floor. Sorry no pictorial evidence as they are fast little rodents. My tip is thought if you do eat food in you room try to make as little mess as possible and put all your rubbish in the bin and just before you go to sleep, tie up the bin and put it outside. The cleaner is a total tool. He knocks on your door and as soon as you open it he runs in and starts shouting for you to get up, so if you have the balls just tell him to piss off. He seemed to wear the same clothes everyday - not very clean. I think the higher your room is the later you will have your room cleaned, as we were on the top floor we got out rooms cleaned everyday at about 1 o'clock. Also i got revenge as i spewed into the sink that was in our room and he had to unblock it. Rock n roll. The only thing that went missing while we were there, was a girls pair of shoes who was invited back to our room. One of my mates ended up giving her a pair of skating shoes, as none of the staff were helpful.

Three friends, my partner and I stayed in this hotel from the 30th March till the 3rd April. We had made changes to our booking and had this confirmed by the hotel manager. Upon arrival, we were informed that we had only been allocated a four bedroom room, for the five of us! They did reduce the cost slightly, but this shouldnt have happened in the first place. So, we go upto our room, 211, and the first thing that strikes you is the fact that the hotel looks nothing like it does in the pictures on the website. The lights next to the mirror on the wall did not work and the safe under the table, had no code to open. We were slightly annoyed the following morning by the obnoxious cleaner that knocks on your door at 10am so that he can clean our room. This was most annoying as on a break you should be able to have a lie-in and the cleaners should come in when you have left of your own accord! Upon returning to our room later that same day all of our bags and clothes had been moved accross the room and my friend had had 70 Euros taken out of his hold all in the bed room. We searched high and low and could not find this money and could only put it down to the cleaners helping themselves to a tip!!!! Obviously, after this we carried all of our valuables on us, but how safe do YOU feel walking through the City of Amsterdam with your wallet/cash and passport all upon your person. On the second day we were moved to room 300, up another flight of steep, crooked stairs, this room was bigger and to pay the hotel a small compliment, the towels and bed linen was changed daily. This room was a little better, (so we thought), as it was slightly larger and my partner and I could seperate a bed away from my friends! But, that evening after being in town we returned with a takeaway, to mop up the excess alcohol in our systems! We had all settled down and most of us were asleep, when my partner started hearing noises near the Takeaway packages. She awoke myself and my friend and we sat up listening, there was a rustling sound. We just sat on our bedas looking at this paper bag moving on the side, when all of a sudden a mouse fell out of the bag and scuttled accross the floor. This scared my partner immensely and she did not sleep a wink that night, which also meant that neither did I! The following morning at 7am I went to the reception and informed them that we had mice in our room and they really didnt seem phased. It was as though this was a regular occurrance and that i was just another one that was complaining! The people on the reception informed me that they could change us rooms but they could not guarentee that this would not happen again, as Amsterdam is built around so much water! I was not happy but didnt really have any choice as we had already paid for this hotel! I returned to my room to break the news to my friends that there is not much they can do, when the obnoxious cleaner turned up and filled the hole that he thought the mice were coming out of with pollyfiller. We tried to inform this gentleman that we thought that they were coming from behind the radiators and he just laughed and said that mice are all over Amsterdam. The following evening, i was obviously shattered as i had had no sleep the night before, my friend could not sleep as he had seen the mice again, personnally i did not see them this night, but by the shattered look on my friends face i could tell that he had been awake all night! The restaurant was nice, but the breakfast was not, we only utilised the services for a coffee in the morning to get us through the resty of the day due to extreme tiredness.

We got to our room (big windows, no curtains) which was oddly furnished with old beds, and began unpacking. Within an hour or so, we noticed the bed bugs. Although they are not suppose to come out until later at night, they were evidently hungry as they were everywhere! We immediately packed up, and got out of there as fast as we could. We went to the reception, and asked for our two nights money back. They said that they were not going to do this, despite the hotel being infested. We managed to get one night's refund, but only manually written on a slip, as they would not process it right away and told us that this was how it would be done. We were moved to another wing (the stairs again) which seemed okay. We were also told to check through our luggage to make sure we did not have any bugs in it, which we did. However, as bed bugs spread rapidly, I am not sure that this wing of the hotel will stay clean, especially if they move guests from one to the other. As we were exhausted from the moving, we barely saw Amsterdam that day. When we arrived home, within a few weeks, something began to bite during the night. The bugs had gotten into my luggage, and I managed to carry the infestation home with me. To add to that, the refund was never put through on my credit card!

We had booked 2 rooms and when we arrived at hotel in evening we were allowed to view room 217 to see what it was like. First impressions of hotel were that it is very basic but I also felt that some of the reviews on this site were a bit harsh. Me and my mate went to work on checking the beds for bugs although we didnt find any the sheets did have a few holes in and black marks and odd staines in some places. We did find some evidence of bug infestation on the panelling / skirting boards there were black marks and evidence of bugs esp on the ceiling where my mate had taken a photo of a dead bug. Having said this none of our group of 7 had any bites / inflammation / boils on their skin. The bathrooms were very clean my bathroom in 211 was basic but the shower worked fine and wash basin was clean although there was a door in bathroom which we swear we could hear someone behind view out of window showed there was infact a room there which was a bit creepy as on several occasions we heard movement. There was no curtain on one of the windows but we soon fixed this by making a make shift one out of a spare sheet. The rooms had a quite strong smell of bleach which can be overpowering at first. Room 211 is very noisy we could hear noise from street and alleyway and doors slamming all nite. The cleaners are very noisy and knock on the door at around 9:30am they seemed to be a bit annoyed that we wernt out of rooms but after 2 days they just knocked and asked if we needed anything. I found the staff on reception to be very friendly and disagree with what other people have said on other reviews. Regarding previous reviews stating about security in hotel although none of us had anything stolen i feel i would be unhappy leaving anything valuable in the room the staff seemed very interested in when we would be going out and I would recommend keepng all passports / money / valuables under your pillow whilst asleep. This holiday was a lads one so we were too hungover / tired to make breakfast so i will rate the hotel as follows Reception staff ( 4 out of 5) Cleaning staff (1 out of 5) - Rude, Arrogent, Noisy Beds / bedding ( 1 out of 5 - Uncomfortable, holes in sheets, weird staines Bathroom (4 out of 5) Location (5 out of 5) Furnishings ( 1 out of 5) - Dirty , evidence of bugs, smelly, dodgy wiring for tv Hotel Corridor ( 1 out of 5 weird smell almost makes you throw up and staines on carpets) Value For Money (4 out of 5) - good but very basic bedding could be better Overall 2 out of 5 this hotel is a great budget place to stay it is very basic and i would only recommend it to stag nites / lads holidays and the budget traveller. I had a great time in amsterdam I would like to mention although i experienced no major problems i will not be staying here again", "Date": "January 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guildford, Surrey, UK", "Title": "\u201cGood 4 groups, Bad for safety,Cheap,Location great, 3/5\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4357547", "Content": "I'd already booked my stay at Hotel Manofa & just 2 days before i'd planned to leave (with not enough time to cancel), i thought i'd check out the reviews for it & i found travel advisor... After reading what everyone had put, i was completely dreading coming to stay, what with me & another friend seeing reports of bed bugs, doors not working, shady people coming in & out,rats, passports stolen etc I'd booked a long weekend (13th-16th Jan) for my birthday weekend with me & 6 friends, we stayed in rooms 211 & 217 (2 x quad rooms)which were fine apart from a strange locked room in the bathroom, that i'm sure i heard someone in, which could have access to the bedroom....? We made sure as soon as we arrived that we checked out our rooms from top to bottom, as there was NO WAY i was going to get lumbered with a room after i'd paid, but they/we were quite happy to agree after seeing that we'd got rooms looking quite-like the ones in the photos, although i've read they keep those empty! I'd of prefered to of kept are keycards on us, but maybe they've had problems with people loosing them in the past? My friends must have thought i was completely mad/nutty the amount of searching i did in my room, but there was no way i was going to end up with bites like in those photos from earlier in the reviews I searched high & low (using my camera phone light) but couldnt find any alive bed bugs (although u could clearly see where they had been, & a dead one as on our celling, which was worrying as it was! People were walking in & out of the hotel, like it was a public toliet, no one ever asked if we were staying there, but i told my friends not to take any chances, we took out passports out everywhere we went, also made sure all our bags had locks/padlocks on. We didn't feel safe in the hotel, which was are main concern of the weekend, we shouldn't have to worry! The hotel is in such a great location & lucky for us, we had an amazing weekend, we paid \u00c2\u00a317 a night each so overall we couldn't complain. The stairs really weren't as bad as people make out, even with me having the biggest case, guess being on the 2nd floor had it's advantages. The allyway however, was very nosey, it sounded like people fighting & things being dragged along (huge bins?) one after another, at about 5AM in morning! None of my friends made it up on time for breakfast, so i can't comment on that, from sound of other reviews, it's worth missing anyhow, & u can get a full english from one of the restaurants just outside. For a group of friends, i'd say the Manofa is fine, its cheap, it's in great location (for RLD, Dam square etc) & we didn't have problems! Just dont't bring expensive items with you to the hotel, ur only worry about their safety, check out the rooms BEFORE you pay, so u know what your getting first, take ur passports along with you out & pull ur bed off the wall, or sleep with clothes on, like me (just incase those little buggers were in our room!)

It was dirty, 3 of the 4 lights didn't work, both shared showers in the corridor were broken, but hey, it was the only available room in Amsterdam so I had to lie through my teeth snd pay 545 euros for three nights. 20 euros a night would have been too much! Got through 2 nights and had intended on going home on the 3rd as we had to book 3 nights minimum. We went to collect out bags from the room at 5.30pm as we had a ferry to catch. The key card wouldn't open the door, we had to go down 3 flights to reception to have the card remagnatised and each time it didn't work. Half an hour later reception decided to actually come up and try themselves, to no avail, after some fancy computer box that the manager came up with an hour later we were told that we couldn't get in until the following morning!! They gave us another dormitory (6 beds in this one) and we didn't have any clean clothes/wash stuff etc. Shame having to stay another night in Amsterdam I know but in the morning when we explained we had to pay for another ferry and an extra days parking and that we weren't happy they told us it wasn't their fault as it wasn't their doors!!! Hmmmmm, it was their hotel though surely. Anyway, its supposed to be a 2 star hotel. I've been in better hostels.

We also found bed bugs in our beds of which I took some pictures to make sure these were really bed bugs and not other insects. We left the hotel and the same day my mother found her arms entirely bitten and became inflamed. The next day the same thing happened to me. The doctor stated bites of fleas on Monday 15th and emphasized that he has never seen such a thing before. He referred us to a vet where we had to buy some chemicals to kill all the fleas which had spread in both of our flats. We paid more then 160 euro only for the chemicals (I had to disinfect my flat twice)!!! In addition to that we were not allowed to go to work because of the infection danger which reduces our salaries. These were the most expensive short-holidays we ever had.
