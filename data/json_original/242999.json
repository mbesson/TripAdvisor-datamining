Close to local transport, walking distance to some attractions and numerous places for food and many pubs. Security: In a safe area and the front entrance is video fed to the office. However, the front door lock needs replacing so guests do not spend time jiggling and jostling their key to get it to open. Plus, a basement patio door is permanently unlocked. Decor: Extremely dated, to where all public areas and most rooms need repainting and new carpeting. Accessibility: Not a place for anyone with a physical limitation. Entry doors and internal doors are difficult to push or pull, there is no lift, all stairwells are very thin and winding, and both the reception and dining room are downstairs. Cleanliness: Good. Room: Very, very small and insufficient or non-existent closet/draw space. No bedside table, phone, alarm clock or coffee maker. Some rooms had digital TV but others have basic analog (antenna on top), and one metal (patio) seat is available. The bed or beds are extremely uncomfortable, to the point where sleep was a luxury and back pain was guaranteed. The en-suite bathroom is tiny and only soap and a bath-towel are supplied. Staff: Very courteous and friendly. Breakfast: Very limited and you're still hungry afterwards. Additional info: Wifi is available but only in the dining room. There are additional charges for paying by debit/credit card, internet use, luggage storage, and a(cash) deposit required for your room/entry keys, which are not posted/known by guests. Basement/dining area and rooms in that area smell of fried food at all times. Cost: Too much for what you get. Recommend to others: No! Would say to spend another \u00a320-40 an night at another location, where it's modern and a better breakfast. Return: No!

We arrived at the reception expecting to recieve our key - we had already booked and paid for the hotel (in full). However were told that there was no record of our booking and there were no rooms (with a ensuite bathroom) which we had booked. I advised the person that I had emailed earlier - she had replied to my email asking for my reservation number and I provided it - but then did not reply back. I figured that was enough. However what eventuated was that they had no booking and even though I emailed they had not thought to follow it up!!! Which brought us to that fateful night where we stood wondering where we were going to sleep - really really scary and horrible. Turns out the hotel person (we heard her shouting at the agent) uses hotmail and gmail for hotel booking and surprise surprise hotmail is sometimes faulty (and didnt get our booking)! Insane! I am surprised they dont have their reception area set up in a public telephone box! After much begging we were told to go to another hotel in a complete other location at our own expence. Actually she told us to take the subway and bus,but with a transit strike and our first day in London that was rather unfeasible - so a cab ride later we arrived at the....hotel from hell!
