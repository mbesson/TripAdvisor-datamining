I just got back from a three-night stay at the Marunouchi Hotel, and I thought it was great. I was in Tokyo on business - the hotel was very convenient to the train station and my meetings. It was also very easy to get around the city by either subway or train, and the hotel was about a 5-10 minute walk from the Imperial Palace. I had access to the club floor with my room, so breakfast in the club lounge was included (it was fine - a basic breakfast of juice, cereal, sweet rolls, fruit, etc.). In addition to its close proximity to the train station, the hotel is in the same building as a number of restaurants, a huge bookstore (with many books in English) and a small drug/cosmetics store. It was perfect for a business trip and would be a good central location for a vacation. The basic rooms might be a little small for one person, but larger corner rooms and suites are available. The only reason I gave the hotel 4 stars is because there is no gym.", "Date": "Nov 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR831046095", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Jefinur"}, {"Content": "Oasis in Tokyo Just returned after 4 nights at the Marunouchi. It is an oasis of calm, peace and quiet in a crowded and noisy city. If you are arriving from Narita, either by train or aiport bus, you are immediately at the doorstep of the hotel. The hotel is new and tastefully decorated. Others have criticized the breakfast here. My wife and I found everything perfectly fresh and beautifully presented.........a perfect way to start the day. Try the breakfast room on the 9th floor, it is surprisingly elegant.

I work for a Japanese company and I have to have the annual visit to HO, and they booked me here again.I found the staff, especially the front desk, very helpful and with excellent English - just as well as my Japanese runs out after Kampai!.The room was quite small, but clean and well equipped and with a very compact bathroom - but what else does one expect in Tokyo?? It was clean and perfectly functional. The toilet itself warrants special mention, more buttons and dials than a space shuttle...I do agree about the food, I have stayed there seven nights over two visits and was spectacularly underwhelmed by the Western breakfasts: I can't speak for the Japanese breakfasts as I don't take seafood or miso soup. The bar is appalling, but then it is a separate operation to the hotel. The bouncer was most upset that a non-Japanese wanted to go in and insisted on telling me about the 1,000 Yen cover charge - so what I said, I will charge it to expenses. I then told him which company I work for and his demeanour changed and I was allowed in. Once I got in and peered through the smog of cigar smoke at the drinks list I almost wished that I had not been allowed in. Luckily my drinks (and cover charge) did get lost in the eye-watering expenses claim that I submitted...Much better value for FB is to go to the Oazo building next door which has some good options and while not cheap, I'd say good value.The location is very handy for the trains and metro and the airport bus stops just outside so overall I would say it's totally acceptable as a hotel for me.", "Date": "Dec 19, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR121370842", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Rushman2112"}, {"Content": "Modern and stylist hotel in a great location I stayed in this hotel a couple of nights before I move to my new apartment.

I can honestly say that I have never been motivated to write a review. However, this hotel is a shocker and should be avoided.I stayed at the hotel for 2 weeks in August 2006. It is across the road from the Tokyo Railway Station and it is clean and 'chic'. However, it is ridiculously over priced, the food is a ridiculous brand of French mini meals at astronomical prices, drinks are unbelievably expensive and room service is a joke in terms of quality and choice. The breakfast menu is tiny and poor quality (I have eaten better quality food in a US$15 per night BB). There is no pool or gym. The rooms are small and the staff are slow and unresponsive.If I had paid for this hotel rather than my company, I would have walked about the first night.

Travelling on the Yamanote Line out of Tokyo Station I saw a building with Maruzen and Marunouchi on the sides. Maruzen was a large bookshop on Ginza which had also disappeared and there they were right opposite Tokyo Station. I immediately booked a single for two nights at my wife's instigation. It is beautiful but very modern and minimalist. The views over Tokyo Station are great and you can even see, but not hear, aircraft inbound to Haneda Airport.I loved it, the only proviso that I would mention is that the buffet breakfast is far from European size and variety.

The hotel is connected to the beautiful Oazo shopping center with wonderful bakeries, restaurants and shops and is a short walk from more shopping, and the Ginza shopping district, which is about 10 minutes' walk.
