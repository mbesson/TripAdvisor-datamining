All reception-staff friendly. The only thing I didn't like was the headboard, old-fashioned covered in fabric. Find it a bit unhygienic..

We had sent an email requesting a balcony room but when we arrived we were told that the one balcony room had already been taken but instead we were offered what the receptionist described as the best room in the hotel. Later, we discovered that no rooms have balconies. Given some over reviewers' comments about small rooms, this is something to expect in Rome but we were very satisfied with our first-floor room and can recommend room 101 because it is a suite, with views over the street (yet we had booked only for a double/twin room!) This is ideal if your partner or travelling companion snores, as one of you can sleep on the sofa-bed! Each room also has satellite tv (but not BBC World) so 2 separate televisions can be watched. If we are being hyper-critical, a deserving little moan would be about the shower which was more like a tap...and a rather unpleasant-looking (and too short) shower curtain causing water easily to be sprayed on the floor. The breakfast is quite basic with both coffee and juice-drinks from a machine (not great!) with the main criticism being that breakfast finishes at a rather unnecessarily early 10.30a.m. The bar is a bit-of-a-joke being grossly understocked and with the receptionist doubling as bar staff (valiantly putting on a brave face given the bar's inadequacies)... so don't count on the bar as a great place for ambience and good choices of drinks because it most certainly will fail you. These minor criticisms are more than compensated for by the hotel's good location and we found the staff to be both efficient and friendly. For a choice of restaurants close-by, we'd recommend taking a left turn out of the hotel, and right into Via Panisperna (but avoid at all costs one of the closest: 'La Carbonara' which was our big mistake of our trip, if not the worst we had come across in Italy(!) - but the rest were very good, especially 'Do Do' on the right of Via Serpenti, further on.

Although there are some not so positive points, it wouldn't be fair if I will focus on them alone without emphasizing the positive things that Hotel Canova offers. As with most other hotels, the hotel is in an old traditional but refurbished building. First, it is located in a good location, close to the Termini - around 3-4 minutes walk, but situated in a somewhat quiet neighborhood. Although the idea of staying near the termini sounds off-putting to others, there are actually more advantages. It is also close to major tourist sites (Santa Maria Magiorre, the Colloseum, etc). The staff is friendly and helpful and speaks good English (especially those assigned during the day). Breakfast is included, basic (of course) but nevertheless good and enough. The lady at the breakfast room is consistently friendly with a sweet and happy Bongiorno every morning. Their rooms are clean and the daily housekeeping is very good. The glass panelling on their windows to shut off occasional noises from the street below works. Their lobby is good too. About the negative things that we had experienced during the stay, I have 2 general complaints. Although the hotel was good, I thought they failed to do something on the safety side. They don't have a map of emergency exits inside our room (probably in all rooms) nor did I see any map at least on their hallway (we we're staying on the 5th floor). And even if you can find yourway to the stairs, you may find it somewhat scary as it is narrow and the railings are not in a proper shape (check-out the pictures). Another complaint is about the floor in our room on the 5th floor. I don;t want to generalize this because I don't know how it is in the other rooms and floors. Our floor seems to be somewhat unstable because everytime we walk, the cabinet doors would shake and make noise. We were not bothered with the noise but were bothered by that fact that the cabinet doors would shake each time we walk. I would understand it if the floors were made of wood but I know that concrete floors are meant to be hard and stable and would not make a lose cabinet door shake if you walk around on it. Again in general, the hotel is good and if you're not bothered by those negative things that I mentioned, you will like Hotel Canova.", "Date": "July 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Co Armagh", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel...Great Location\u201d", "Author": "DonaCoArmagh", "ReviewID": "UR4392051", "Content": "We have just returned from a four day trip to Rome.

Moreover, despite having a double room - the hotel only had one key to the room -- which created significant problems. As in many European hotels, you must have the key in the room to use the lights/television -- as a result, when one of us decided to go out at night while the other remained in the room, we were forced to choose between the person remaining not having any lights -- or relying on the frontdesk person to dig out a master key to let us back into the room.
