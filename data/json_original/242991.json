The outside of the hotel is not impressive but that is were the negatives stop. We were booked in by a smiley pleasant receptionist in a fresh welcoming reception area. The hotel looked as if it had been freshly painted, it was clean, warm and quite modern although there was a little noise at night from traffic it was not enough to keep you awake. Also my daughter had the space/peace to prepare for her interview. Breakfast was served in a lovely adjoining coffee shop- an excellent continental breakfast was included and just \u00a33 for full english. The area couldn't be better about 1 minute to Chalk Farm tube and a pleasant walk to Camden market etc. If you like this area it is perfect- I stayed in Hilton Hotels the following night and on a previous visit and preferred this hotel for many reasons-it was not luxurious but the area/atmosphere is great and it is also considerably cheaper.

The hotel is shabby looking but it's clean, i can not fault it's cleanliness. The bedding and towels were fresh and clean. I was in room 110, when i first tried to shower it took a good 10 minutes before the water was tolerable on my skin, before that it had switched between boiling hot and freezing cold. It was still way too hot for my liking but it was either that or a cold shower. The next time i tried to shower, i couldn't, there was just no hot water coming out, no matter how long i left it running. Also in room 110 i had problems with the lock, it was really hard to get the key out of the room once you'd opened the door. They are my only critisisms. The staff were friendly, the breakfast was nice and the location is excellent. I had a double room which was \u00c2\u00a385 a night, i do think it's a bit overpriced, i'd have expected to pay about \u00c2\u00a370 with the hotels current decor, but, like i said. The location is excellent and this is London. It's right near Chalk Farm Tube Station, a taxi rank, a mini sainsburys and morrisons and just a 5-10 minute walk from everything. Camden Town Market & Stables Market (About a 5 min walk) are definatly worth a visit, the stalls are a little repetitive after a while but well worth a look anyway, loads of food stalls from all over the world and well, camden is just amazing. It's beautiful. Plus, Primrose Hill is just a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel, i went up at night and you can see the London lit up. I was staying in Camden alone, i'm a 19 y/o girl, and not once did i feel unsafe/scared. Everyone i encountered was friendly. I loved it so much i'm now trying to find a way to move down there.

It's busy, central and easy to get to via Underground or walking (driving is like any inner city - best avoided!).

The decor shows evidence of vast amounts of guest traffic and beyond the Reception area communal and service areas are very much less attractive and maintained. The rooms are OK. Still basic but OK. My room was clean enough but the carpet was showing those tell-tale signs of heavy guest use. En suite facilities are OK too. Clean (the most important thing in my view) if a little compact (but then I don't spend that much time in en suite facilities, so what the heck!). So to the best bits. Chalk Farm Underground is 50 metres away. Camden Town underground is a 10 minute walk away and Euston station just a 25 minute walk away. That's central! And the hotel is surrounded by restaurants, shops and boutiques; in what is now fashionable Camden Town. And for a leisurely walk Camden Lock is just down the road and next to the well-known, if not famous, Camden Market (expanded now to take in Inverness Street). For English public house fans there are too many good ones to mention - but I will give a special mention the the Buck's Head by Camden Market for its well kept handpump beer.

If you want the vegetarian full english, they ask for \u00c2\u00a33.

There was a kettle and two tea cups in our room plus coffee, tea and sugar, all towels in the room where changed everyday so there was no need to use the same towel twice.

The only problem was that there was no lift for our luggage, dragging two cases up three flight of stairs was hard but well worth it. (they also have a luggage room, which was handy as i wanted to go back into town and didn't fancy dragging my case with me) There's no doubt that I will be returning, whether its for a romantic stay or just with the girls..

Arrived around 4.30pm and found the hotel almost immediately on exiting Chalk Farm tube station. It was almost directly opposite the Roundhouse where we attending a gig that evening, so the location could not really be better. Checked in, booked a 6am alarm call and made out way to our room up three flights of stairs (take note, no lift) and found the room at the back of the hotel as we had requested. On opening the door the smell of damp was the first thing to hit you. A quick inspection of the room resulted in noting the following: A square hole about the size of a socket cut in the pasterboard just about the head of the bed with no attempt at having it filled, electrical cabling from the television gaffer taped together with more cable in order to make an \"extention\" for it to reach the socket. More gaffer tape used to secure the tv aerial into it's socket, a damp patch approximately 4 feet in length directly above the window. Mould around and above the pathetic excuse for a shower (a watering can would give more pressure) and a light that didn't work. There were no toiletries save for a tiny bar of soap and the water took forever to warm to little more than tepid. (including the shower) The bedclothes consisted of a wafer thin quilt with an ill fitting cover that had so few buttons on it, it barely stayed on. As I mentioned, we had requested a room at the back of the hotel so as not to be disturbed with too much noise. What I hadn't thought to factor in though were the other guests running around the hall shouting at 4.05am or the 2 or 3 ventilation units of various fast food outlets below that belched the smell of chip fat into the room thus rendering opening the windows impossible unless you really like the smell of gease. We had an early morning flight booked on the Saturday morning that we made by the skin of our teeth as the 6am alarm call was wasn't made to our room either. On handing back the keys to reception as we left I mentioned this, but the chap on the desk seemed more intent on his paper and cornflakes than on us. Anyway, it was our choice not to complain about the various issues. We arrived at 4pm, were out again by 4.30, didn't get back until 1am and left again at 6.45am so we were in the room little more than 6 hours hence the reason we didn't complain. \u00c2\u00a379 for a room is not expensive, but Travellodge and the like are about the same, but they don't feel like a glorified doss-house.

We were a bit unaccustomed to the English type breakfast so we kept to cereals and toast, which worked well for us.

A quick search on google came up with the Camden Lock Hotel, so i booked it via the hotel's own website. In hindsight i could have probably found it cheaper elsewhere but i'll come to that later. The hotel itself was functional, with everything that needed to be there, but not a lot else. There was a small seating area near the reception desk which also doubled up as the location for breakfast in the mornings, but no seperate bar. Check in was very straight forward, and the member of staff who served us was friendly and helpful. The rooms were basic but comfortable, although slightly on the small side. There was a TV, a desk and chair, two beds, tea making set, and nothing else. No fridge, safe, or sofa, for example, so not really any good for relaxing. As we were only there for one night it wasn't much of a problem, but i probably wouldn't consider staying there for more than a couple of nights. The bathroom was a reasonable size, although our shower didn't get anywhere near the heat we set it too. Even with the dial at 50c it was nothing more than luke warm. Not a major problem and something that could hopefully be fixed quickly, it was only a small annoyance to us because of our short stay. The inclusive breakfast was one of the best parts of our stay. It was advertised as continental but it had nearly all the bits and pieces to make a cooked breakfast, as well as cereals, and toast. And it looked as if you could eat as much as you want, as it was all self service. There weren't any negatives to our stay, and the only area where the hotel loses marks are in what i see as slightly poor value for money. The cost of the room was \u00c2\u00a379 per night, and whilst i appreciate that is good value for a centrally located hotel, i still expected a bit more in the way of facilities both in the room and the hotel as a whole. Also a bit of decoration to give the hotel a bit of character wouldn't go amiss. Overall, i would probably stay there again but mainly for the location, and i would probably recommend it to friends and family, but not whole heartedly.", "Date": "August 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London & Birmingham UK", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Value!\u201d", "Author": "CockneyBrum", "ReviewID": "UR36509446", "Content": "It's pretty hard to find a good value hotel in London for \u00c2\u00a379, so we were delighted to find one which was. Primarily we chose this hotel because we were seeing 'a-ha' at the Roundhouse opposite. The hotel is so near that you can practically see your room from the venue! The room was a good size, with a flat-screen digital TV with Freeview (I've not seen this in more expensive hotels), a good shower, and a comfy bed. The only disadvantage to the room we had was that it was dead opposite a pub, which can get noisy. The area is \"lively\". There's a good kebab takeaway a few doors down and a decent pub across the road. The hotel is a very short walking distance from Chalk Farm Hotel Underground Station and is on a main bus route into Central London. We didn't have breakfast as we woke up too late, but this didn't matter as nearby Camden Market is highly recommended where you can get good food from almost every corner of the globe. One thing to watch is that there's a sneaky \u00c2\u00a33.50 charge if you want to pay by credit card. We also didn't see a lift, so if you're carrying heavy bags you might want to ask for a ground floor room.
