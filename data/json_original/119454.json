After my brother uses the toilet (thankfully only number 1's) he flushes the toilet and the water continuously flows over the bowel onto the floor flooding the bathroom and going out onto the carpet. I go to the front desk to ask if the staff can come and have a look and help us. I was told no! He refused to help or give us gloves and only gave us towels that guests use to dry themselves to clean up the 'mess' on the floor. He would not even give us a mop or change us to another room. I asked for some disinfectant but all he gave us was window cleaner. It took my brother over 16 towels and 2 hours to clean the room. The next morning we went to speak to the manager who was not there. My brother asked for the rest of the stay to be for free for the inconvenience but the staff member said no. He said he would refund out money except not for the previous night. He said it was suspicious for that the toilet overflowed and thinks that we intentionally damaged it. We said we would be putting a review on Trip advisor to let other guest know not to stay here.

We stayed at the Andaz in LA at the very start of our Honeymoon had actually chosen the Saharan at the end as a cheaper hotel for the fact that it is where the video for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153DJ DJ\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by the Transplants was filmed! Anyway, we got to the Saharan a little early on the day we were checking in, but I thought it was worthwhile seeing if we could check in an hour early anyway. The gentleman on reception checked with housekeeping and was able to check us into our room. The room itself was as was expected \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was clean, king sized bed, bathroom (shower & bath) and a TV. It also had a fridge and microwave in the room. I had no issues with the room itself. There was a pool which seemed to have people there each day, but we did not use the pool ourselves so I cannot comment on the water etc. The car park was the only area of the hotel that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say would lose it points in my opinion. There was not very much room to manoeuvre round in the car park \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially if it was full. The gate at the back of the car park was closed at night (which we were not told when checking in). You can still get into the carpark through the front of the hotel, but if you got back to the hotel late at night there was never anywhere to park! I spoke to a man on reception one night but unfortunately struggled to understand his instructions about where additional parking was available. After driving round the block a few times trying to look for the additional parking he mentioned, he ended up getting us to park near the pool which seemed to be a common occurrence based on the number of cars we saw parked there at night! The Saharan is in a good location on Sunset \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there are a number of places to eat / drink within walking distance of the hotel. If you want to see the Walk of Fame and Grauman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s theatre etc, then that is in walking distance too \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just one road over from the hotel! When we did check in, the staff talked us through tourist attractions available and happily helped us with some of our plans which was good. If you buy a Hollywood Stars tour from reception they arrange for the company to come pick you up from the hotel reception which can be handy if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drive or don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to walk over to the tour offices!

I picked this place because I was attending an expo at the LA convention center and I was planning to hit the Hollywood night life at night. I called first to see if they had a room available as hotels on Sunset Blvd can get booked pretty fast on weekends. Of course the prices are higher on weekends. I checked in about 3pm and got the room in a flash. From the outside the hotel looks like in good shape. I had room 216 which was upstairs and around the corner. The room was clean and plenty of towels. Looks like they just recently rennovated the place. Nice tiles on the bathroom shower walls. A fridge and a working air conditioner. No alarm clock in the room, nor telephone book either. The walls are super thin. I can hear the couple next door in room 317 having a little fun (if you know what I mean.) There is Ralph's supermarket right across the street (sometimes you can see stars shopping). There is a strip club right next door and another one around the corner going towards Melrose Ave. The neighbor hood is ok. Plenty of people walking around at night if you stay on the strip. If you exit the hotel, to the left are all the clubs like Saddle Ranch and The Standard. (I usually stay at the Hyatt or my favorite Best Western Sunet Plaza when I like to party on Sunset...but was too late on booking a room) I saw a group of girls walking towards the clubs but I think it's too far to walk, especially coming back after dancing and drinking all night but you can always take a cab back. After the expo I attended in downtown LA (ooh that LA traffic!!!) I got back to my room about 10pm and parking was pretty tight but it was secured (and it's free...some places charge for parking). If you have a SUV this can be very very tight. Back to my room after an eventful expo and then I can hear my neighbors at it again. Pretty funny too me!! My room was on the side of the building so you can hear the Sunset Strip noise. It didn't bother me and it wasn't too loud. When I checked out I wanted to see if I left anything under the bed. Under the bed was clean but in between the matress was a dirty men's underwear (NASTY!!!) and behind the TV was an newspaper that was too tight to reach. Check out was a breeze and they had wrapped danishes for breakfast along with coffee and OJ. Don't expect a full breakfast because a lot of people do. IHOP is close by. Like I said before my favorite place to stay is the Best Western Sunset Plaza because it's right there where the party is at on Sunset but this place did it's job. If you are on a budget then this place is good.

All that for $85! We were driving around on Hollywood Blvd and Sunset Blvd late in the evening, looking for a motel. Saharan had the best price, a safe parking and we took it. After having a bite at the Mexican just one block away (Acapulco, try the sizzling apples!), we got back at the motel and had a good sleep in the comfortable beds. Next day at sunrise we could have a good look at the well-maintained motel and the very nice pool. This place is on the busy Sunset, but because of the way they built it, you will not hear any traffic noise in your room. The staff was very helpfull (I needed to print my boarding passes, and they did it via their fax-machine, and they gave me some great info on the way to travel easy to certain places). Despite the fact that some people call this a bad neighbourhood (hookers, dealers etc.) we did not experience any trouble at all. Do not forget: you \u00c3\u00a1re in downtown, with all the things (bars, restaurants, lots of people) that come with that fact. But once again: we did not experience any problems whatsoever. And the breakfast being bad? Who needs a motel breakfast if you are just three steps away from Sunset and Hollywood blvd, packed with good diners?! BossaNova just across the street was very nice.

Firstly, I would absoulutly recommend this place if you are on a budget and want a decent place to stay. Compared to some other hotel we stayed at in the USA, this place was very good. We arrived early and as our room was not ready for an hour we were able to leave our bags there while we went and had lunch. I also beleive we were given an early check in being 11.00am as most hotels in America had a check in time of 3.00pm. I contacted the hotel direct and received a rate of $69.99 US plus tax, which was a lot cheaper than many other hotels in the area I had contacted. The room appeared clean, despite a couple of carpet stains which didnt bother me as I know these are unavoidable ( I am also in the Tourism Industry). Our room had a mini fridge and microwave which was fantastic, but you do have to request these as they are not in all rooms. There is a supermarket across the road which was very handy. Being on Sunset Boulavard it is only a 10 minute walk to the Chinese Theatre, Kodak Theatre and Walk of Fame which are all on Hollywood Blvd amongst other things. The airconditioner did a good job but was a bit noisy at night when you are trying to sleep. We used the pool once and it always looked very clean and well maintained. We didnt take advantage of the free breakfast but you have to be early to get it. In Australia I would say that this hotel is the standard of a 3.5 star. It was clean, cheap and in a great location. I would very much consider staying here again and would not hesitate in recommending it to others.

Right in the thick of things, free parking, free wireless internet. This was my first stay at The Saharan. It's right on Sunset, right across from Ralph's supermarket. There was a little frige in the room which was very convenient-- and it was already cold when I got there. There had been a mistake in my reservation, and I ended up with a smoking room. Although the deskman was a bit chiding, he wasn't unpleasant and I was allowed to change rooms immediately, although it's rather hilarious that a non-smoking room is more expensive! I paid the difference and was glad. I was upstairs, around the corner, away from the pool, which was fine. The room smelled wonderful and everything looked new. There were not quite enough hangers, but I was able to accommodate my clothing in one way or another. It would have been problematic if I hadn't been alone. The pool is very pretty and clean. The pix on the Saharan web site show another small pool, but that wasn't evident anywhere I could see.The A/C was magnificent. The wireless internet reception was iffy where I was, but I really was quite a way from the office, and if I carried my laptop onto the stairs, I got a full-throttle connection. The room phone's ring was pleasant. I had to put a $20 deposit on an ironing board and iron, but I got it right back when I brought the iron and board back to the office. I was in town for business, so I spent most of my time away from the hotel, but it was exceedingly nice to anticipate the cool room.

Had five days in LA to visit the tax man and catch up with friends. Didn't want to spend an arm and a leg. Felt kind of funny, considering I was staying in my own home town. Chose the Saharan based on location and price. $80 bucks/nite, tax included, booked thru Tripadvisor/Expedia. And what a great choice it was! Yes, it's east of West Hollywood, but only by a couple of cross streets. The place is scrupulously clean, with daily maid service. All rooms located on two stories face inward, courtyard style. I had a non-smoking upstairs, with its back to Sunset Blvd. It wasn't particularly noisy. The room itself was fairly large, with a comfortable king size bed. There's a desk, a fridge (ask for it, not all rooms have it, apparently,) a microwave, a TV with HBO but for some reason not many other channels, and a long shelf with a rack below to hang your clothes. No closet space per se and no in-room safe, so lock your suitcase or store your valuables with the management. I liked the Bangladeshi guys who manned the reception very much. At first they were gruff, but they soon warmed up and we ended up trading stories about living abroad. There's some sort of breakfast, but I think it's restricted to donuts and coffee. There's a Whole Foods nearby if you want good, healthy stuff, and of course [Rock'n'Roll]Ralph's supermarket directly across the street. A laundromat is located right next to the motel. Parking was a little tricky (narrow spaces) but manageable in a secured lot behind the building. There's also extra unsecured outside parking along the building wall on the west side of the motel. There's a mix of motel guests, ranging from families to rowdy party types. I always felt very safe though (I'm female, traveling alone) and I had no problems or other security issues. During the weekend, the place was up to capacity, but during the week it was fairly quiet. I never saw anyone in the pool, which looked clean and well-maintained. The rooms have indvidual cooling/heating. The bathrooms are sparkling clean. Good shower. Bring your own hair dryer, otherwise you'll need to ask for one. I didn't spend much time in the room and when I was there, I kept the curtains closed, since people walk right by the windows. That's the only drawback to this otherwise excellent place, in that it tends to make the room a little dark. But if you don't care, I'm sure others won't as well. In sum, I'd stay there again, if I wanted to save money. The price, the location, the convenience...unbelievable. And to think that the Mondrian a few blocks west charges hundreds of dollars more for its depressing, hospitallike rooms..or the overpriced Standard on Sunset, with its prisonlike, shag carpeted, crappy trend-excuse for a hotel...so yeah, this was another great LA deal, take it from a local!", "Date": "April 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "sydney", "Title": "\u201cgreat for budget\u201d", "Author": "cordan", "ReviewID": "UR4966278", "Content": "Stayed here with my partner for two nights and for the price have no complaints.

The rooms were all clean and were cleaned regularly throughout our three week stay. The bed was king size, with a large TV with over 20 channels, AC and an adequate bathroom. They provide coffee in the reception area which was always available. They also provided pastries and fruit juice in the mornings from 7.30am till 9.30am, but it tended to be there until it ran out really. When we got there and were put in a non smoking room by mistake, the staff were quick and helpful in moving us. The staff were friendly and helpful, even the quieter members, and they called us taxis, let us store our stuff when we checked out and arranged tours for us with hotel pickups - Disneyland etc. They gave us advice on this and amenities in the local area. Speaking of which there is a Ralphs supermarket across the street and a great chinese takeaway next door on the left....Green Tea Chinese....we would definitely recommend for nights in! And there are plenty of places to eat out nearby - Bossa Nova for one. The pool and lounger area was pleasant and clean and all the other hotel guests were fine. The place is in a great location with Hollywood Bvld one block up and other attractions a cab ride away...the furthest we went in a cab was Santa Monica for like 30 dollars. It was only 15 to Universal Studios. Staying there for 3 weeks we really got to know the place and the staff were just as you would want them...there when you needed them but left you alone the rest of the time. Although it's not really a family place due to the location and the fact that the amenities are really geared towards the fact that it is a motor hotel, we would recommend it to anyone else. Although we didn't use it we saw plenty of people by the pool using the wireless internet, and there was a telephone in the room. At an extremely reasonable price The Saharan is indeed the best place to stay on Sunset Bvld and we would definitely return and recommend.
