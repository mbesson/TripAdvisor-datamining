I was last there shortly after it opened and not much has changed. I stayed in an executive room which is still as disappointingly small and I could see nothing in it which made it seem different from any other non executive rooms in which I have recently stayed. The toilet is of comfortable size, toiletries are normal, room is clean and bed is large. There is a type of chaise longe which offers a degree of comfort but the views from the hotel are very dreary in downtown Kowloon (not the hotel's fault of course!) The service again is as one would expect in Hong Kong, quite efficient but rarely warm or sincere. Check in staff were fine as were some of the staff in the executive lounge. Unfortunately I did overhear an argument between one guest and a lady on duty in the lounge, neither was giving way but I felt uncomfortable sitting near and hearing such verbal abuse being exchanged between the two. The snacks and drinks in the lounge are excellent, the breakfast there is continental but a larger one can be had downstairs in the main restaurant where as usual, I on my own was given a single table away in the corner crushed against the wall. The tables are very close to each other so there is no point in planning a cosy chat a deux in that particular restaurant! My stay was quiet but I left thinking, where had I been for the last three days? Was there anything memorable about the hotel or its service and the answer I think was \"bland and harmless!\"", "Date": "September 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pretoria, South Africa", "Title": "\u201cLovely stay in a vibrant part of Hong Kong\u201d", "Author": "msNightglow", "ReviewID": "UR139875005", "Content": "This was my first trip to Hong Kong, and I must admit... I LOVE HONG KONG!! So anything I write will be a little biased I suppose. First of all: Stay in Kowloon, it's such a sureal experience! The overwhelming and undeniable Chinese influence wrapped in a very Western, business driven energy... It's an experience that can't be described and that I honestly didn't expect I would get caught up in. The Novotel is steps from Nathan Road, and just around the corner is an Airport shuttle bus drop off. Two minutes walk from Jordan metro station, and if you keep walking (which is easy as this city seems to pull you in anyway) you'll find Kowloon Park among the crowds and shops, a quiet oasis. After 5 minutes you reach the harbour where you find \"The Walk of Stars\" and a breathtaking view of Hong Kong Island. The Novotel has everything you would expect of a 4 star hotel, very modern with friendly staff. Our room was on the small side (apparently it's like this in all Hong Kong hotels) but sufficient, nicely decorated and clean. The bathroom was nice and clean, but only had a shower... which is fine with me but I'm just mentioning it. We didn't take the breakfast so I can't omment.

The hotel itself was located on a side road off the main Nathan Road. It is about a 5 minutes walk to the nearest MTR station, Jordan station. The Jordan station exit B1 had a lift which made it more stroller friendly. Directly opposite the hotel there is a Congee place which served quite good congee. It is also very close to the Australian Dairy Co. which has breakfast option and next to that is Mak's noodles which also serves good noodles and wonton soup. The hotel is also very close to the Temple street market. Upon exiting from the hotel, turn right, and head down and under the subway (underground) passage, surfacing on the other side, continue walking straight till you see stalls selling all sorts on both sides of temple street.

Everyone was cheerful, helpful and very courteous to us as guests throughout our all too short a stay here.

Complimentary breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails in a private lounge on the 15th floor plus free wi-fi. Don't think twice about this if you do stay here. The hotel restaurant is excellent - the a la carte menu is good but the international all you can eat buffet served each evening is too good to miss. Even the locals come to take advantage of this. Oh, by the way, being a Novotel you even get a choice of alternative pillows if you don't like the ones provided. Jordan Road MTR is a couple of minutes away so you can get to everwhere very easily and cheaply - Landau Island for the airport/Big Buddha, harbourside for the Symphony of Lights, Central Hong Kong for the tram to the Peak or shopping. Temple Street night market is right on the doorstep and a great experience (just be prepared to haggle over price).

The staff said we would receive the upgrade room perks in the twin bed room we had which sounded great but no special little treats or perks showed up during our stay. I took this option after working out the cost for us to have wifi on two devices, breakfasts, and a couple of drinks in the bar each night. We breakfasted down in the main restaurant and I was very impressed with the options given, and the staff friendliness. Our room was fine, I had read a complaint about being able to see the people in the building over the street, ummm yes high rises in most cities have that issue and I really can't see why people complain about it the management can't exactly move the building to give more space! The concierge on the ground floor were polite and helped with any questions, bags etc. The bar staff were more intent to stand around and gossip - I'm sure it was something very exciting or scandalous but service first then go back to the in-depth conversations. The staff on the premium floor weren't overly friendly or maybe it was lack of confidence in speaking english but it felt flat? It was an easy stroll to the shopping, public transport and night markets. It was great to finally get a face cloth in my room after 2 months of traveling in Europe and never seeing one!

Not very convenient if you have to lug bags after shopping. It is near the Jordon MTR station but 'near' is subjective. About 3 blocks away to be precise and you take the stairs down to reach the subway. I booked two executive rooms. The checking in process was smooth though it took a while (30 minutes and we were the only ones checking in). I wanted to help ourselves to some soft drinks but we were told drinks were available only between 5 and 7 p.m. Rather different from other executive floor practices which offered some form of hydration during operation hours but never mind. We could respect that. We bought drinks from the 7-eleven nearby. Breakfast food was very very average. Some continental fare and two or three types of dim-sum dishes but it is not of standard Hong Kong fare. Hence we only ate breakfast on 2 of our 5 mornings. Novotel Nathan in Hong Kong pales in comparison with other Novotels elsewhere. If this was my first Novotel experience, I would probably not give other Novotels a try. On the second evening when we tried to have the evening cocktail, the lady setting up the food helped herself to some alcoholic drink when working. So much for professionalism. There are some some eateries (cha chan tang, as they are called) along the small street behind. They serve better food than the hotel but there is always a queue comprising mainly of locals. Reasonable price. Perhaps it was just our luck but the room on the executive floor that we had had certainly seen better days. Some of the cupboard doors were giving way and the sight outside our bedroom windows was an equally sorry sight. We looked right into the adjacent building that was in a sorry state with books piling up in one of the rooms (Yes, it was THAT close and if you could see the neighbours, so could they see you in your room). The rooms are also tiny. Not much space for one to open up one's luggage. Hotels in Hong Kong are small I know but this is a room in an executive floor. Given a choice and if staying at this hotel is NOT a must, perhaps you can consider some of the other options available nearby or elsewhere.

There's a console by the king bed to control lights and radio, and amenities like a coffeemaker, plug adaptor, plentiful desk and bedside power outlets, and a small bedside rolling tray are still there. The 32in HDTV console has a VGA, LAN, power ports but no HDMI or audio inputs. A sliding door covers either the bath entrance or the adjoining closet but not both. This is a slight problem at night as this door is best left covering the closet to deactivate its light. This leaves the bath open to the corridor, and when its lights are turned on it floods a darkened room with bright light. Instead of the two cube seats by the window we found a small chaise sofa which can sleep a small child. But I requested for a free bed which was big enough that I wound up sleeping on it instead. We tried the buffet breakfast on our last day, it was plentiful and good featuring many meats, fruits, and greens and great breads and coffee, and thankfully my kids ate for free. These family-friendly features made for a nicely affordable stay. Housekeeping and Reception staff were good and friendly. Billing is fast and check-out was straightforward as before. One difficulty was getting a taxi right away during rush hours, the concierge were attentive but apparently taxis are infrequent in the area. It's best to go down and have them hail one as early as possible.

This time it was not that easy, since Hong Kong got more expensive and the hotel we used to stay did not exist anymore (Hyatt Regency Nathan Rd) After studying the Tripadvisor we finally decided to book at the Novotel since the comments about the Hotel were quite reasonable. Despite the hotel is a bit further up the Nathan Rd., the location is still central and one can reach the points of interest within a few minutes. Since the hotel is not direct at the main road it is quieter. The first impression when entering the hotel was positive already. I nice fresh smell welcomed us and the modern bright appearance of the interior design looks inviting. Like a lot of other hotels in Hong Kong the lobby is situated at the first floor and can conveniently be reached by an escalator. The front desk staff is efficient and after a few minutes you get the key of the assigned room. As we have learned from other guests comments the rooms are rather small. During our 4 days stay we\u2019ve had time to study the interior design and the furniture which are modern and nicely designed. But\u2026. because the rooms in general are so tiny in Hong Kong, the architect has chosen the wrong design. The bulky bed headboard and the TV box are taking to much of the limited space. Therefore you have problems moving around in the room specially if you have to suitcases blocking the way. The bathroom is tiny as well, but well equipped with a glass wall shower and all necessary amenities. Another choke is the cabinet. You have to stretch yourself that you can reach the hangers and of course the space is very limited. To safe space the architect has provided a common sliding door for the bath room and the cabinet. That means if somebody is on the toilet you cannot close the cabinet.

I got a great deal through the British Airways website and this was my first time staying in Kowloon. I got the limousine shuttle to the hotel (HK$130) - there are cheaper options like the MTR or the A21 bus- but to be honest I wanted the least fuss and it worked out around \u00a310, which was hardly a huge dent in my expenses. Check-in was prompt and pleasant enough. I was given room 610, which was directly opposite the lift, but despite occasional noise (mainly the irritating piped music in the actual lift) I didn't really notice it enough to bother me. Certainly no one was making a noise when I went to sleep. The room was spacious for Hong Kong standards - I had a good size king bed, a desk, large TV, a chaise longue/sofa, wardrobe (with slippers/laundry bag/shoe shine items), and a bathroom (with bath, shower, toilet, sink and a variety of toiletries). The room was clean and well maintained with a large window. I could hear outside noise - traffic etc - but it didn't bother me at all. The only downside I felt was the bed - which was incredibly hard. However, I had so many pillows to choose from, that once I had all of them on the bed I could just about get comfortable. I kept the 'do not disturb' sign on my door throughout my visit, and this was respected. I was called and offered any housekeeping items if needed, but I was fine without (I prefer my room not to be disturbed on short stays). The major downside was the cost of internet access. I travel for business so it is essential, but at HK$130 a day it soon adds up. Starbucks is a one minute walk away and I could get it free in there. If they just made their internet free I would certainly recommend it. Of course, if internet is a not a concern, then it's a pretty fine hotel. It sits a short 2 minute walk away from Jordan MTR station (which has lifts if you take that route from the airport), which is on the central line and can zoom you over to Hong Kong Island for $8.50. Alternatively, take the leisurely 25 minute walk in the humidity to the Star Ferry Terminal and catch the pleasant ride at HK$2.50. Well worth it.

Kowloon is on the other side of the harbour from Hong Kong Central, but it is where all the markets are. The ladies markets (Temple Street) is only 500 metres from the hotel, whilst the other markets are at the other end of Nathan Road, you are just around the corner from Jordan MTR station, which can take you most places you want to go for $4,00 HKD (which is equivalent to 50 cents in Australia). The hotel has a great buffet dinner, which is also at a reasonable cost, but the menu does not change, so if you were staying longer than 2 nights, it could get repetative, but saying that you do have an option for A la Carte. This restaurant is very busy and has a lot of locals eating there, so it is recommended to book. Although there is no pool to cool off in at this hotel, it does have the location, but no views, other than other buildings. But if you have come to shop at the markets and you want a base, this hotel is in a great location. Room size was average, but very impressive decor. Not a hotel for just sitting around enjoying the view and the room, but very practical location for the shopper.

My flight to Hong Kong got delayed so I arrived at the hotel very late last night. I booked an Executive Room with 1 King size bed with Premier benefits but I was given one with twin beds. I was tired and I wanted to rest so I accepted it. I went straight to my room and was surprised by its size... not in a pleasant way. It is so tiny that I felt claustrophobic. I have stayed at the Executive rooms of other hotels and this one would pale in comparison. The room looked dull, lifeless and cramped. No \"executive\" feel about it. I understand that space is at a premium in Hong Kong but I have stayed at hotels with rooms smaller than this one and they have made use of the space better. I debated with myself if I should ask to be transferred to another room then I figured that the others will not be any bigger. I was really exhausted so I stayed put. I opened the curtains wide to make the room feel larger and I regretted doing that. Check one of my photos to see why. This morning I decided to have my breakfast at the ground floor because I know that the Premier lounge would have very limited choices of food. Breakfast at the main restaurant was not the best and the choices not as wide as I expected. I would probably skip breakfast tomorrow and just grab something at a nearby restaurant. Afternoon tea at the Premier lounge was also disappointing. I am not going back there for evening cocktails so I will not be able to share the experience. The location of the hotel is about 5 minutes by foot to Jordan MTR station. I won't mind the distance IF I am having a grand time here.

The bed was a king and was comfortable. Ample pillows. Desk area, well equipped. My package included Free Wi Fi, breakfast and access to the executive lounge. The bathroom was the best feature. A great walk in shower, fantastic water pressure. Breakfast was very good. Excellent choices and the quality was very good. The Executive Lounge was the smallest I have ever seen. Cheap modern furniture, certainly very little privacy and would find it hard to imagine it could seat more than 20 people and those 20 people would have to share tables with others. Really not a lounge at all because seating was not comfortable enough to linger - possibly the intention. A few ' snack ' items and drink available. Pretty much self service - including the drinks. Help yourself from a bottle. The first time I have seen this in a lounge, but frankly, I would prefer to be served. The hotel location is central enough, Jordan would probably be the closest MTR.

The room had modern trimmings and everything you would expect from a hotel of this category (4-Star, I believe).

There's a 7-11 opposite the hotel and a Chinese Restaurant/Coffee Shop if you want to try local and inexpensive local cuisine.

We chose a Premier floor room which has added extras such as breakfast, either in the Premier Lounge or the Square Restaurant, afternoon tea in the Premier Lounge and evening cocktails also served in the Premier Lounge. We opted for the Square Restaurant buffet breakfast which had many choices including western and asian and were more than happy with the food selection and service. I had afternoon tea once in the Premier lounge, there were several choices of sweet and savoury snacks and the coffee was good. Evening cocktails were a must and it was nice to have a relaxing drink before hitting the streets for dinner. Our room was clean and comfortable and a little larger than I had anticipated. Daily room service was always completed before we returned from our day's outing. The staff were always friendly and helpful with any of our questions about getting around the city. Emmily who was working on the Premier floor for most of our stay was exceptionally kind and helpful to us and we would like to thank all the staff for making our stay one to remember. From our easy check in to check out we could not find any faults with the Novotel Nathan Road. We had a couple of meals in the bar area which were tasty and quickly served and the staff there were also courteous and efficient. I have read some reviews where people have complained about taking their suitcases up the escalator to check in, but if you go to the concierge desk at the hotel entrance your luggage will be sent to your room only a few minutes after you have checked in. Our last night we decided to do the buffet dinner in the Square Restaurant, it is very popular with locals and tourists. My only drawback with our dinner was that the dishes were not replenished quickly enough for the amount of people that were there but the food on offer was very tasty. Novotel Nathan road is close to the night markets and the ladies market and a short walk to the harbour. Very convenient location and would definitely stay there again if we go to Hong Kong.

The King bed was not-too-soft comfortable with a choice of pillows and a console to control lights and radio. Amenities like a plug adaptor, plentiful desk and bedside power outlets, a small bedside rolling tray were thoughtful. The HDTV console had a VGA, LAN, power ports but no HDMI, Al Jazeera and Foxnews were dissonantly available. There was no outdoor view to speak of, but my wife found the two cube seats by the window great for naps. The stylish bath was cramped but functional with decent hot water pressure. Toilet is top push-activated though which I heartily dislike. A single sliding door covers either the bath entrance or the adjoining closet but not both, this is a problem at night because the door is best left covering the latter to deactivate its bright closet light. This leaves the bath area open to the corridor, and turning on its overbright ceiling light floods a darkened room with too much brightness. I resorted to plugging a USB light into the wall shaver outlet for nightime duties. Housekeeping staff was thorough and friendly. Reception staff was a bit hurried and cool, but then we did arrive at midnight and they were tired-looking.

Good location, and the hotel is actually quite easy to locate as bus A21 from the airport stops only a few steps away from the lane that you need to turn into in order to get to the hotel's front doors. (Just do some research on the internet and you'll know how to find the hotel entrance.) Only gripe is the awkward escalators which you need to lug your suitcases on in order to get to the reception, if you don't want to leave them at the concierge. Within walking distance to night markets, and even to Mongkok, if you don't want to take the MTR. Also, there's a Starbucks just next block, which is good news for SB lovers. Staff at the reception are pretty well versed in English, and all of them are very well mannered and polite. Though not overwhelmingly friendly, they were quick to address any concerns that patrons have. We arrived earlier than the check-in time, so we weren't surprised to be told that the room was not ready yet. It was not a big problem as we just left our bags with the bellboys and went to scout around for interesting shops and eateries nearby. Went back to the hotel according to the timing given to us, and we were given the room cards to our room without a fuss. Room size is pretty decent, standard among all other HK hotels. All requests were fulfilled - non smoking floor, extra pillows, king sized bed. Their mattress was lovely, and I find the softness of the pillows just right. Lots of electric sockets in the room to charge our gadgets (my partner and I were gadget freaks), which is a huge bonus.

Check in was fairly efficient, and we had a standard room on the 3rd floor. View wasn't great, but further to other reviewers about the not so pleasant views, this is to be expected when you're right in the centre of the city next to loads of other high rise/old buildings. This is Hong Kong! However, if you like magnificent sea/river views then go for the 5 star hotels near the harbour that cost \u00a3200 plus per night. The room size was more than adequate with space to walk around the bed and a chaise longue at one side of the room by the window. Very comfortable bed, very clean and the bathroom modern with good supply of toiletries (shampoo, soap etc, and also cotton wool pads/buds, shower cap...) You get 2 bottles of distilled water complimentary daily. Rest of mini bar stuff you had to pay for with standard rate. Good supply of tea and coffee making facilities, however as with most of HK hotels you don't get fresh milk or even milk jiggers, but powdered coffeemate milk. Air Conditioning was good and fairly quiet and the hotel was generally quiet all round (lucky that we had good neighbours!) There's a 7 eleven opposite and some fairly cheap diners, the big restaurant next door apparently does good dim sum. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel due to the price. The bar was good with efficient service and most nights had live music consisting of singer and musician, very relaxing. Drinks are expensive though, e.g. \u00a34.50 - \u00a35 for a pint of beer, however most nights there is a happy hour on 2 for 1 selected drinks, BUT the complimentary 'tapas/serrano ham' offer with drinks was not available to us even though we went about 4 times. The gym in the basement is pretty good with cardio machines and free weights. Towels and a water cooler machine provided - BEWARE the 'pink' tap pours hot water, don't do what i did and take some and gulp it down thinking it was cool water!! Tip - there is a bus stop on nathan road going to the airport (for your return trip) however it's on the other side of the road. If you have luggage (and even if you don't) go down the subway to get to the other side, it's quicker, but you need to carry your luggage down and up steps, depends which is the lesser of two evils (we had really heavy cases and it was awful carrying them across the steps but as nathan road is a dual carriageway you have to walk a while to get to a crossing). Another tip - for foreigners you may well get mega-hassled by the guys at the nearby tailor shop asking if you want to buy a cheap suit - my travelling partner wants me to post a good (!) tip if you do get hassled, just tell them you're a tailor yourself and he doesn't bother you again. Laundry tip - come out of the hotel (side street) turn left going up to the road running parallel to Nathan Road, then turn right, and there's a cheap launerette ahead on the corner of the next street. I definitely recommend - the only thing I would say is, even though you put a 'do not disturb' sign in the mornings, housekeeping would RING you several times to get a time off you of when it would be convenient to service the room, this AFTER they have placed a card under the door asking you to contact them.

The check in took almost ages. We reached the hotel by 1PM and was told that the check in time was 2PM and we will need to wait as rooms are not ready. That meant wait for an hour with my 4 year old daughter and wife after a 14 hour journey. At 2PM, I was told it will take another 45 minutes which totally flipped me out. The reason why I chose this hotel was because I was an Advantageplus member and have always been treated like royalty in all Novotel/Pullman/Sofitel brands. Finally, I get my room at 2.40PM which means our plans for Disneyland are nixed badly. Remaining of the stay itself was ok, nothing bad or good, just about average. The breakfast which we had there was good and filling but the Indian food was not great. FInally, after 3 days while we were checking out, I went to the reception and told that I will check out in the next 15 minutes (at about 12PM). I go up and the phone rings and a lady tells my wife that an addl. HKD200 will be charged if we do not check out within the next 10 minutes!!! Typical of the place, left hand does not know what the right hand is doing. My outrage was even more prononced because they conveniently forgot that they gave us our room a full 40 minutes late. I'd say its an ok hotel, but there are better hotels in better places in HK for a lot less that would be happier to serve you. The only saving grace was the service I recieved post checkout. Unfortunately, I had presented my Forex card for blocking at the time of check in and this amount was not reversed. The lady checking us in promised she will send for cancel but typical of my check in experience forgot about it (I had confirmed and she assured me that it had been sent for cancel). I reached India and started my follow up to get this cancelled. Edward Leung was very helpful in working to identify the chargeslip, etc and in his absence George Wong sent the required letters in a jiffy to take care of the reversals.

There is also a good porridge and noodle shop (\u5f4c\u6566\u7ca5\u9eb5\u5bb6 or Nathan Porridge and Noodle House). Just next to the hotel is this unassuming restaurant that offers great Tim Sum too. It caters for wedding dinners and the dim sum was surprisingy good and reasonably priced.

The rooms are small but well-designed.

The Club Room was tiny and severely under-staffed with only 2 staff members at Happy Hour, running frantically in all directions. The Nespresso machine was a nice touch, but a pity as it was out of water and the accompanying milk jug was empty both times we visited! We opted to have breakfast downstairs or at the nearby vegetarian restaurants to avoid the Club Room chaos! We were disappointed with the rude and impatient staff members that we encountered at the Club floor and the general reception. They were inflexible, curt and generally lacking in manners.

If you plan on taking the Airport Express train and then the MTR (subway) to get to this location then please be advised that there are no escalators as you are exiting the station to get to street level; you will have to climb two flights of stairs with your luggage. The hotel is popular with tourists and business people from around the world and with families. Both the rooms that I stayed at are small, with my room the second time around being smaller than the first, which I did not think was possible. There is one restaurant at the hotel and one bar that serves light meals. I ate breakfast at the restaurant and they offer only a buffet. Note that the menu of the buffet is that same everyday. It does not change....ever. The food at this restaurant is very average at best and the service is also average at best. The one area where his hotel needs to do a better job is training their staff to deliver world-class customer service. The staff tries hard but fail more often than not. The staff is young and unlike other hotels that I have stayed at the presence of management on the floor is non-existent. A few things caught my eye in terms of failure to deliver world-class customer service. After my first stay I had requested a quieter room for my next stay, which was only a day after I had first checked-out. The room I receive ended facing Nathan Road which made the room very noisy and I was also give a room that was smaller than my first room. Another time, I had arrived at 2:31pm for lunch and was told that I had missed the lunch specials by 1 minute and they couldn't offer this to me. Not big issues but I know that other hotels would have accommodated me on these two occasions. Overall, an average experience.

Why? Because I am extremely happy with the whole experience so far. We arrived later than expected as my niece was sick and we went to the airport medical centre (it's in Arrival Hall A) then took the A21 bus here. The ride here was very nice - seeing night lights and enjoyed the very comfy seats with much more legroom than the plane! The bus stop was very near the Nathan Road-Saigon Street junction (the entrance to Novotel is on Saigon street even though the address is nathan road) so it was just a 1 minute walk to the hotel. We had 2 strollers, 4 kids and 6 bags and managed quite easily even though there was only 6 adults. (But take note to get off the bus quick as the bus actually moved on before all of us got off as it was crowded and we had many bags and strollers to get of the bus. Managed to shout out to the driver and he stopped the bus a few meters down the road) When entering the hotel, the hotel staff very quickly got us to leave our bags with him, gave me a slip and asked me to proceed 1 floor up to check in. Check in was very smooth and even met the Assistant Manager Derek Lim who made the children very happy with little gifts. Thanks! In my earlier email correspondences with him, he was kind enough to arrange a complimentary cake for my mother as it was her birthday on the day that we checked in. My mother was very touched with this surprise. Another big thank you Derek and Andy! (Andy is in Reservations and it was a pleasure corresponding with him via email. I had tons of questions and he answered them all very promptly in a very nice way.) When we got our keys and went up, the bellboy was already in the corridor with our luggage! First time for me that my luggage actually arrived before me :) We had requested rollaway beds and it was all nicely arranged in our rooms. Even our request to have the rooms on the same floor was fulfilled and exceeded my expectation as we had 3 rooms in a row! Yes, the room is compact when compared to most hotel rooms in other countries for the amount of money paid BUT it is very spacious if you compare it to hotels in Hong Kong. Just need to adjust your expectations accordingly as space is a premium here so don't expect to get the same size hotel room as you would in Malaysia, Singapore etc unless of course you are willing to pay much more for the top of the line hotels.

Didn't happen and all went without incident. The Novotel is right on Nathan Rd intersection and its close to just about everything. Our room wasn't ready but we did arrive 5 hours earlier than we were supposed to and to the Novotel's credit, they went out of their way to get us into our room quicker as we had been flying all night from Melbourne. They upgraded us with ease (at our request) and were very efficient.

You have access to a free buffet breakfast, free afternoon tea and free evening cocktails and canapes. Free internet access is included and they just make you feel a bit special........See our previous review with South Wharf Hilton (similar set up) Really nice rooms considering Hong Kong crams in their apartments and buildings and they cater very nicely for the little touches. Cable TV included and big king size bed. You can open the windows if you are in a smoking room (yes smoking rooms exist here) and the bathroom, although small, very nice and everything is clean and catered for!! Complimentary robes and slippers, in room safe, iron and board, mini bar, small fridge, universal adaptors in room (and available for sale at a cheap price of 10 AUD and the premier lounge always a winner with Aussies (everything is free that's why:)) Value for money is not bad considering the price for most things in Hong Kong is reasonably cheap so overall, I thought value for money was worth the upgrade and worth the stay. The staff are very friendly and will help you out with touristy stuff, tours, free advice, personal favorites of restaurants and just very friendly! Kong Kong itself is amazing and I could spend 2 weeks here just touring around seeing what is going on - amazing scenery and landscape - high rise buildings everywhere and really cheap deals on the street for clothing , jewelry etc....

Whilst I wasn't expecting much, I was expecting more than a bowl of corn chips surrounded by small bowls of salsa, guacamole and sour cream. To top it all, the massage at the spa in the lobby has to rate as one of the worst I've ever had. You're better off going to Taipan foot massage on Nathan Road.

Our internet (wired and wireless) was included in the price as was breakfast; we chose to go down the restaurant on floor one every morning. The totals are just taken off the bill at the end. The executive floor lounge was a decent size and the food & drinks selection outstanding: I asked if they had any vegetarian sandwiches and a tray was immediately presented. Lovely little snacks for afternoon tea and cocktail hours, excellent service from the front desk. We were given access to a room for a quick wash in the evening after check out which was very kind. The rooms were more than large enough; the chaise lounge affair by the window was surprisingly comfortable. It is easy to plug in you computer on the spacious desk. The bathroom is well designed though I only had a shower, no bath tub. There is a kettle, cups etc and a small fridge. New arrivals are advised to step over the road to the 7/11 to pick up a few snacks rather than pay for the mini bar. There are two apple macs in the executive lounge and around another four in the bar on the first floor. The bar has a resident singing duo who are good and serves bar snack type meals. The nearest MTR is Jordon. If you like vegetarian food go down the subway underneath Nathan Road: when you come up there is a restaurant on the corner called the Sino-vegetarian restaurant. You will also find another one down nathan road (south facing) turn left on Jordan road and look for a sign that says Light Vegetarian Restaurant. Laundries abound in this location. I used one on the road one block on from the Sino-vegetarian restaurant but i also noticed another one much nearer the hotel: turn left out of the hotel, then right. `You will see Professional Laundry on the corner a couple of blocks on. They all seem to offer about 7 pounds for around 32 HK dollars. If you want a taxi the young men in reception will step out and look for one for you driving past; you can also just walk down to Nathan Road and wave your hand. We didn't use a bus to get from the airport as for two of us the taxi was only 235 HK dollars. An Octopus card is worth getting as it saves you fussing with small change. There is a largish supermarket on Nathan Road called BILT. Look south, cross over the road, cross over the Jordan Road junction. You'll see a sign which points downwards to the super market. You will be offered made to measure suits when you step out but the chaps are very pleasant and will eventually take no for an answer if you don't want to take them up.", "Date": "September 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai (Bombay), India", "Title": "\u201cValue for Money\u201d", "Author": "Avista_Mumbai", "ReviewID": "UR118555369", "Content": "I have been visiting Hongkong for a few years now and on my last visit stayed at the novotel.

It is one of the smaller hotel rooms I have ever stayed in (even though we paid for Executive Floor on 14th floor). But realistically, we payed around half/third of the price we normally pay when we stay in HK, so I guess you really do get what you pay for. If you want something bigger, check websites for floor plans or email them and ask. I couldn't find the Novotel's room sizing before we left (probably because it is not a selling/strong point) but would guess it was under 30sqm. If you plan on just visiting your room to shower and sleep and you are on a budget, this room more than fits the bill (ie clean, safe, tastefully furnished, decent amenities in room). If you were like me (on a girl's trip) with a bit of luggage and sharing a twin room with a friend, it would get a bit cramped after 3+ nights. Pick somewhere bigger. Bathroom door shares with the wardrobe (wardrobe shut/bathroom door open and vice versa) which was a bit awkward sometimes, and there was very little hanging space and no drawers. The twin beds were almost touching (a little bit too initimate for friends I thought) so you wouldn't want to choose this room if you did not know your travelling companion well! The room we had did not have a view (perhaps you could ask what the alternates are). We looked out to a pretty old building that looked like it had been fire damaged. I could see water in the distance from the Exec Lounge floor (level 15), so this may be a possibility as there were some rooms on this level. LOCATION and AIRPORT TRANSFERS Location is pretty good if you want to stick to the Kowloon side of the Island - there is food on every corner, 7 eleven on the street, StarBucks less than 50m away etc. If your interests are on the HK Island side, stay closer to the Kowloon waterfront or on HK Island itself (just to save a bit of time on the Metro etc, not because this hotel is particularly far away). Metro is a short walk (and very cheap), and cab rides are inexpensive by Australian standards. GETTING TO/FROM THE AIRPORT Take the Airport MTR to Kowloon (special at time of writing $18AUD for two people), then when you arrive at the Kowloon station walk downstairs to the taxi rank and ask them to drive you to the Novotel which costs approx $4-5AUD plus around 80c per luggage piece. It will take about 14 mins on the MTR and approx 10mins in the cab. This hotel is a fairly close taxi ride to/from the Airport MTR (Kowloon stop) so don't bother with expensive transfers direct from the airport which takes double the time (sometimes more in bad traffic) unless you have small children, heavy luggage (beyond managing on your own) or not very mobile. \"Free transfers\" offered by other hotels (not sure if they are offered by the Novotel), take 60+ mins as you get driven around hotel to hotel and dropped off when it is your turn. FOOD/BREAKFAST Breakfast was included in our package. If it was not, I would have been heavily disappointed at price/value. It was pretty basic, the juice was warm and a lot of the hot food luke warm/cold. The pastries were stale when we ate (which to be fair was in the last hour of breakfast) Highlights of the breakfast menu would have been the fresh bread (which made excellent toast) and the fact that the Chef happily made me fresh scrambled eggs when I asked (most point to the cold scrambled eggs in the bain marie and basically tell you to go away and will only make omelettes). Service in the actual dining room was quite sparse and meant we were only greeted, presented with the bill for signing and left to our own devices. Plates piled up on most days, but were eventually cleared. STAFF in GENERAL/ CONCIERGE/ CHECK-IN CHECK-OUT Staff in the rest of the hotel were very polite and had no trouble with any requests or questions. They were happy to please and I found them very friendly. Check in/out process was very easy and efficient, so too were the Concierge. INTERNET/WIFI Internet is included on the Executive floor, but you need to bring a laptop. iPad/Wifi use is limited to the lobby and Executive lounge area. There are around 5-6 Macs in the lobby for general use (free) but these are heavily used. There are also 2 Macs on the the Exec floor. WOULD I STAY HERE AGAIN? I'm not sure. I would probably prefer to pay more for a bigger room. If room size is not one of your priorities, and budget is in question - this place is decent value (excl the breakfast) and I would highly recommend it under these circumstances.", "Date": "August 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cClean..convenient and comfortable\u201d", "Author": "Blueming", "ReviewID": "UR116811667", "Content": "Room was good sized by HK standards and beds comfortable.

If you are an Advantage Plus Member your breakfast for two is about 8 AUS dollars each, and the chef will cook you an omlete that makes you want one everyday. They can arrange transport to and from the airport on request and is cheaper than booking it yourself about 11AUS per person. Get on any of the Star Ferry Buses and go to the harbour and explore Hong Kong on your own you wont get lost as the Transport System is easy to Navigate. On a whole I found a new love for Hong Kong after not being there for 15 years and there is even a Disneyland which I will return to next time. The hotel was fantastic and the seven days went quick but did everything I wanted to do, you can even arrange to slip over to China in Shein Shen for some shopping but you need a Visa that the hotel can arrange or get one before you leave, its just a ride on the Train system and your there and they accept all currencies its an experience. I your want a great hotel in a easy location then the Novotel Nathan Road is a great place middle of everything and they cater for all including free Apple Computers in the foyer to keep in touch, if you want it in your room with your own computer about 35 Aus dollars for a week.

We had booked an executive floor room so the receptionist personally took us up to the separate check in desk on the 15th floor, where we were checked in quickly and given a full explanation of the additional benefits of the Executive floor package. Our room was very well decorated with good quality fittings in the bathroom and a big shower with a wall and ceiling shower head. All the fittings and furniture seemed very new so I don\u2019t know if it has had a recent makeover or not. Compared to UK and Australian 4 star hotels this felt more like 4.5 or 5 star quality. We had free use of the premier lounge which included breakfast, afternoon tea and cocktails in the evening. The lounge is small but comfortable. The breakfast choice was quite good and the drinks in the evening were self service with a reasonable choice of wines, beers and spirits and a small cocktail menu to help you make your own. Some people have said in reviews that the lounge was full for breakfast. We ate fairly late each morning and didn\u2019t have any problem but I could see how it could get full at busier times, although you do have the choice of eating in the main restaurant instead. The restaurant on the 1st floor had a good choice of buffet and a la carte meals at what seemed a reasonable price for a hotel. We ate here twice due to bad weather and we were impressed with the quality of the food. The hotel was ideally located in Kowloon, close to shops and markets and a 5 minute walk to an MRT station.

The young man then told me that it was Accor policy to take such a payment and could I not pay with another card or cash. My only other card is a debit card so I didn't want to use that. I had cash but I didn't understand why if I had already pre-paid he could not trust me for another hour or so and give me the keycard to my room and wait until the problem with visa was resolved. he then advised he could do this but would have to lock the mini-bar and put a stop on any other services within the hotel!

I went to the foyer with a collegue and we we escorted by a lady-staffer up to the 15th floor book-in. Book-in was fast, efficient and friendly. Free internet access was great, plus the free wi-fi. We could also use two free internet computers on the 15th floor lobby with no hassles. The \"complimentary\" breakfast, afternoon snacks, and drinks were well worth the little extra paid. One slight negative was that I had two A4 photostat copies done which cost me HKD$10, but I made up with that with the free beverages in the happy hour times. The room was very comfortable, lovely king size bed, great tv (but could do with a few more English language choices), spacious bathroom, and nice decore in general. I imagine with two active people it could have been a tad squeezy. Next time I'll visit with my wife. Jordon Road MTR about 2 to 3 minutes walk, go under the steps at the roadway and you can bus it to Mongkok and beyond. Tips for new HK visitors. 1) Get an Octopus card at the Airport for HKD$150. That will save you time and energy when on the MTR trains, buses and ferries. 2) For a fun trip with great sightseeing and shopping, go up to Shenzhen (China border) and bargain at LoWu Commercial Centre. There you can offer up to 33% of the asking prices. Hold your price (with a smile) and you'll own the goods. It takes 10 minutes to get a Chinese two day visa at the border.

My first time staying in Novotel Nathan and it was a good experience. Reception staff and concierge was pleasant and courteous, and housekeeping did a very good job everyday keeping our rooms neat & replenished whatever toiletries we needed. Good service! Rooms were quite small, but were really comfy and cozy. In fact, we felt very much at home, it was like a home away from home. Absolutely no complaints about the room. Modern facilities, large TV, comfortable bed, they even have an iron and ironing board. We booked two connecting rooms, one room had a bathtub in its toilet and the other just a shower stall, I specially like it since one can choose to either the bathtub or the shower. For those who need internet though, unless you use their computers on the reception floor, you have to pay for internet access. The computers were quite useful, as many times, we need internet access to check out some of the places to visit while in HK. The only drawback is you have to wait for your turn if all the computers are occupied. Location wise, it isnt exactly near the MTR, but it wasnt too far either, just a few small streets away is the Jordan MTR. Very good & convenient location! There are many shops near the hotel too and a 7-11 just opposite. There are many good shops and eating choices down the stretch too. Opposite the road is the bus stop for the airport bus A21, so its all the more convenient to travel to the airport. The only complaint i have is that there are no lift from the concierge level to the reception level. It is especially troublesome if we have heavy luggage and elderly people with us. And it is really not safe to ride the escalator with heavy or bulky luggage. I really suggest they do something on this part, maybe install a lift to the reception level. On the day we checked in, there was quite a strong smell while we walked along the corridor to our rooms, but after that day, the smell disappeared, so it was not a problem. I dont know what happened to the carpet along the corridors but there was patches all around, and on the room doors too, it didnt really bother me, but i guess it may be time for some refurbishing or repainting. Room prices was quite expensive, given that there are many similar hotels within the same location with more competitive and lower prices. But I guess the high price is due to the fact that it is part of the Novotel hotel chain. All this little things dont quite bother me, because I really love the rooms!

Note this hotel is on the Kowloon side (not HK island) but it's a great location for sightseeing.

It's also very close to the night markets and wonderful shopping (1 stop away from TST station) where you can also find the Avenue of the Stars and the Star Ferry. The hotel room was nice and quiet. There is no view as you are in the middle of a bustling, busy city. However, it was very clean and quiet, we were never disturbed by anyone. Bring a plug adapter though because the rooms are equipped only for British plugs (HK uses these). I think the hotel offers adapters though not converters. Amenities in the room lacked a separate hair conditioner and body lotion. The lighting system can be a bit confusing, but you just have to control it from the nightstand. Also no free-wifi anywhere in the hotel, it is all pay as you go. There is no real business room, just 5 or 6 MAC computers in the lobby which are almost always being used. The fitness room was better than expected, with free weights and exercise machines (treadmill, bike, etc...) and it was always empty. Check in and check out were easy. The TV in the room is a bit on the small side. Bathrooms do not have a bathtub, only a shower, which was fine for us. There is no swimming pool. If you are looking for a quiet, clean, affordable hotel room in the middle of the city, this is it.

Hotel looks clean from the lobby all the way up tp the room. But, I must comment that the room does look smaller than it shows in the website though. Nonetheless, there's this huge LCD TV in the room, it is probably a 52\" in size. But, I suggest they would probably need to add in more English movies channel than too many Chinese channels. Hotel is walking distance to Temple Street Night Market and a lot of eateries around the area. It is also near to a lot of shopping malls along the Nathan Road. One afternoon I walk blindlessly to the local wet market and I saw juicy sweet corns are on sell, risking that I don't have a cooking facilities in room, I bought some corns and got back to the hotel and ask the restaurant if they are willing to cook the corns for me, and without hestation, the staff say yes but will charge me for a minimum fee, which I think is fair enough. One thing ths hotel really needs to improve is their breakfast at the Chinese restaurant up at 15th floor. The food is seriously unacceptable for a 4-star hotel. Instead of serving something western, they should probably serve more of local dim sum for breakfast and have more selections. I am quite disappointed with the breakfast.

The premier room also got us access to unlimited wired internet which was great for keeping touch with home. The room was on the small side but then its in Hong Kong which is to be expected. The breakfast each day was good and the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel is centrally located in Kowloon - 2 streets away from the Night Market which is a must and a short walk to Kowloon Park which is unbelievably quiet considering the built up location. The buses and MTR are literally less than 2 minutes walk from the hotel entrance and are very cheap - I would definately recommend getting an Octopus card which can be used on all buses. the MTR and also the ferries!! Very cheap transport and great services.

Rooms - People are complaining about the small rooms, i don't understand why people are complaining, these rooms are spacious and well equipt. The bed was king size and just the way we liked it, got a better sleep in this bed then i do at home! The pillows were so good! i wish i could bring them home. Room Service/Cleaning - My god every day we came back from an outing our room was extreamly spotless, clean sheets every day, clean towels. It was just amazing, Novotel went up and beyond everything! Location - Located on the corner of Nathan Rd & Saigon Streets, MTR Jordan Station is 3 minutes walk! And very efficient, compared to australia! Train comes every 3 minutes! Located 3 minutes walk to Temple & Jade Markets. Theres also a 7-11 located right outside the hotel! Which came in hand! Value - At first when i first booked this hotel in australia i thought it was expensive, but now i know why! This hotel is like a well oiled machine! Everything just works! The service, the rooms, the facilities, the food, the room service gosh just amazing! We stayed 11 days in this hotel although we initally booked only 7nights we could not fault this hotel and opted to stay for the remainder of the trip. We went to book at the desk, however we went to check on the internet and it was $300 AUD cheaper so we booked on the internet and we were upgraded to the 15th floor. Not much difference in the rooms but there was an upstairs premiere room which offered drinks and snacks through out the day. Also the staff member Jason went up and beyond everything we asked for and made our trip really great, he also made good suggestions to places for shopping etc and was a great person to talk to! Food - We had buffet breakfast everyday and was really great! Everything you could eat is here! We also had their buffet dinner, one night, and OMG it was PACKED. We were lucky to even get a table as it was FULL to capacity. They had seafood, crab, beef and they were cooked wonderfully! i was so full, but we kept eating cos it was just so GOOD! Also if you are going to eat outside the hotel, DO NOT AND I REPEAT DO NOT go to the restaurant across the street, the one with the fish in the tanks, IT IS HORRIFYING! cons: the only thing bad i can say about this hotel is that, laundry is expensive. if you need to do laundry then on the next street (Cheong Lok St) there is a laundry called the \"Grand\" and they do laundry starting at 32$HK for 7pounds of laundry.

We are not usually big fans of large hotel chains, and we didn't realise that Novotels could actually be so stylish and comfortable. We were immediately greeted by friendly helpful staff from the concierge to the reception. We had booked a superior king room and even though the room wasn't massive, it was spacious enough - especially for Hong Kong. And I loved the 'a la carte' pillow options, soooo comfy. Very clean, modern, stylish bedrooms with a fabulous bedside 'dashboard' to control the lights, music, heating and even the electronic 'do not disturb' sign! The hotel is located just off Nathan Road so it's right in the hustle of Kowloon and the night markets such as Temple Street. A 15 minute walk will get you to the harbourside (along the way you will get lots of men selling 'designer watches and suits' but just don't get eye contact with them and carry on, no problem). It's really easy to get there from the airport - from the airport terminal definately use the Airport Express to Kowloon Station, even with lots of luggage, it's very spacious, clean and quick. Follow the signs for MTR and there is a large ticket desk where 2 single tickets cost us $140 which is approx \u00a310/11, then catch a taxi from the most super efficient taxi rank we have ever seen for just a few pounds to Novotel. Easy! Upon return you can do the same, book a taxi with the concierge to Kowloon Station or they can book you on their own airport coach transfer service for approx the same price. There is a slight language barrier when you flag your own taxi down to get around HK, they act as though they don't understand you, take you the long way round to your destination and charge you more - but at the end of the day taxis are extremely cheap anyway. Just go prepared with a map to avoid getting ripped off! We are not your typical 'cheesy tourist' but I would definately recommend going down to the harbour and having your picture taken at one of the many photographer stalls during the evenings Symphony of Lights - it only costs a few quid for a photo that you wouldn't be able to do yourself! With regards to trips, we were going to book the Lantau trip through the agent in the hotel, but it's just as easy to do yourself using the super efficient public transport system at a third of the cost, and you can do it all in your own time. But an absolute must is to buy your cable car tickets for Lantau/Buddha from the hotel agent to avoid the queues! Also, it's quieter to get the peak tram earlier on in the day/midday - come late afternoon the queue is massive. If you are young and enjoy a drink we would definately recommend making your way to Soho and Lan Kwai Fong on the island, lots of bars and restaurants (and Soho is a great place in the day too with the steep street markets) and in Kowloon head down to Ashley Road for the bars. Overall we would highly recommend Novotel for a hotel based in Kowloon.", "Date": "February 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNovotel Nathan Road Hong Kong\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR97067483", "Content": "The hotel is well positioned, very comfortable and provides good value for money.

As far as location goes, the Novotel is at the wrong end of Nathan Road but very close to Jordan MRT so not too much of an issue.

There's a 7-11 directly opposite the hotel and quite a few decent restaurants around the hotel. Cheers Restaurant around the corner for traditional Cantonese food and Eki's next to the hotel for dimsum were both quite good. Check in was fast and efficient. The main lobby is on the 1st floor with 6 computer terminals for complimentary Internet access. Wifi is available in the lobby but chargeable as part of an Internet package that gives you cable access in the room and wifi in the lobby. Rooms were tight but pretty well appointed. The iPod radio dock was a nice touch. Note however that the only view you have from the window would be the dilapidated building next door! Had the buffet breakfast one day which was simple but quite good. Having said that, if you don't make a practice of stuffing yourself first thing in the morning, consider ordering off the menu ala carte! The hotel is quite close to the Jade Market which is a great place to buy trinkets but do bargain. All in all, a typical Novotel where everything is kept simple but more importantly everything works well!!

I had booked my stay as an accor member via the website. As I had two free nights, I used it to redeem the nights. Upon my arrival, I was told by the reception staff that there wasn't any traces of records of my booking and that there was nothing they could do about it and was told to go to the counter again later in the evening. In the evening when I was back, they said I had already redeemed my free night in one of the Ibis hotels in Korea in October; but the thing was that I was never in Korea at that point in time. It was obviously the mistake on the Korean side and I told the staff I could show her my passport to prove that I was never there, only to be waved off half-heartedly saying that she doesn't want to see it. She also insisted that it was impossible that we had 2 free nights each and that each member was entitled to get only one night free. The next moment, she claimed that it was up to the salesperson who sold us the membership to give us the number of nights free, and that my card was only entitled to one night free, which was already redeemed in Ibis Korea. On top of that, her tone was not only rude and snobbish, but condescending as well. She openly showed her irritation about the whole matter and kept saying that there was nothing she could do about it and that we had to settle the issue ourselves by calling the Singapore accor office. In the end, we had to make several calls back to friends who helped us get the membership, questioning the number of free nights, as well as making calls to the Singapore accor office since 'there was nothing the hotel could do' and that 'we had to settle the issue ourselves'. While waiting for her to settle some stuff in the room behind the counter, a gentleman walked over requesting for a bucket of ice to be sent to his room. This other gentleman was waiting for him by the side as he was at the counter. When another counter staff called to request for a bucket of ice to be sent, she started gossiping about the two gentlemen, and was also giggling about it, not caring that there were other hotel guests around who could hear what she was saying. That issue aside, the room was quite disappointing too. I entered the room noticing that a part of the sofa seat was missing and asked the reception about it, only to be told it was meant to be this way. The previous 2 times I was here, there were two parts of the sofa. Next, I noticed a burn at the side of the sofa. I didn't think too much about it as I'd spend most of the time outside. Although the location of the hotel is very favourable, if this is the kind of furniture and service you provide, I don't think I will have pleasant stay. In conclusion, the service of the hotel staff has disappointed me greatly.

We choose it basically for one reason - the location. You're a five-minute walk to Temple St market and many good restaurants, and Jordan MTR station is on the doorstep. Once you're on the underground line, you can be anywhere in Hong Kong (either the mainland or the island) within 10-40 minutes. The location of the Novotel Nathan Road really can't be faulted. Decent hotels are generally expensive in Hong Kong and I feel that the Novotel is definitely overpriced for what is basically a smallish room with an uncomfortable bed (I started to get backache on the third day) but on the plus side, it's nice to see a hotel room with a very good selection of cable TV channels. I haven't been impressed with the staff attitude on previous stays at the Novotel. I've found the reception staff a bit surly to be honest, but things have definitely improved and the concierge staff were the epitome of efficiency and the reception staff always helpful. My major complaint about this hotel - and probably the reason I won't stay here again - is the absence of wi-fi in the rooms. You can't make guests mess around with LAN cables in this day and age. The better hotels all have wi-fi in the rooms and that's the way it should be. Wi-fi is available in the hotel lobby but it's prohibitively expensive. The hotel does provide about six computers in the lobby for guests to use free but as you would expect, guests - particularly teenagers - often abuse the priviledge and 'hog' the computers with little consideration for other guests. Although the spacious bar area is quite a nice place to relax, the hotel really does need to do something about the rather pokey lobby area, which has seating for barely a dozen people. It's always nice to relax in a hotel lobby for half an hour after a day's sightseeing or to make your plans with maps and guidebooks at the beginning of the day. However the Novotel lobby is not a place you feel like spending time in. It's busy, noisy and far from comfortable.

Laundry facilities located close by and charged at around $2AUD per pound to have washed and dried. Very good service.

We could have secured $7.20HKD to the $1 AUD before leaving Australia. When we got here on the street we could get $7.20 - $7.64HKD (no commission) for our dollar.

I was hoping for an upgrade, and when I stayed at the Novotel Century a while back before I was A-Club elite I got upgraded even then. Oh well. Check-in took an extraordinary long time, not sure why. Noticed that an entire flight crew which came in five minutes after me all got checked in during my wait and I still had to wait another five minutes after that. Rooms were small but comfortable. Felt modern and clean. We had two rooms on a low floor and our views were of an apartment building that was very close. Lobby has four macs with free internet (expensive in rooms). It being Hong Kong we ate at a variety of places, but did spend one afternoon in the adjacent restaurant--looked like it was part of the hotel but not. Dim sum there was terrific, and even though it was packed we got served relatively quickly. There is a taxi queue right outside the hotel and we cabbed it everywhere.

There is a tour desk in the lobby and the girl here was very helpful with answering questions about Macau visas. So overall it wasn't too bad.

Make sure you request a no-smoking room when booking, because we could smell the cigarette smoke on other floors when the lift door opened on them. As one of us has asthma, this would have been a issue. The room was relatively spacious for the two of us. There was a great big TV with a great selection of channels in several languages, and also a nifty iPod dock clock-radio. The hotel is near Jordan MTR station, but for us it was more than 2 mins walk; this is probably because we couldn't find the closest exit. Temple Street is 15 minutes away by foot. Disneyland is about 45 mins away by MTR (tickets are available at the tour desk). The HK Cultural Centre, where you can watch the evening light show at the harbour, is 15-20 minutes away by taxi.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We found the staff to be pleasant-check in and out were both very quick. We took advantage of the cocktail time (perk on the Premier floor) only 2 times, but it was very nice each time. For breakfast, we choose to dine in the restaurant downstairs-the buffet was perfect for our family-and included as part of the Premier floor. The room was a decent size-smaller than American hotels for sure, but typical of Asian locations. (Our family is American, but live in Japan, so we are accustomed to things being smaller than is typical in the USA.) We traveled with our 4 and nearly 2 year old sons. A rollaway was provided free of charge for our 4 year old, and the chaise lounge was the perfect size for our younger son to sleep on. We just pushed them together to avoid the younger one falling off. I highly recommend staying on the Premier floor-free breakfast, free internet, dedicated check in/out desk, free cocktails-all worth it! We got a great deal on Expedia, so we were extremely pleased at all that our room included for the price we paid! While this is certainly not a luxury hotel that caters to your every whim, it's nicer than most \"typically\" affordable hotels are-and certainly one of the nicest places we, as a family on a budget, have stayed. If you are expecting white-glove service, and someone to attend to your every need, no matter what, book somewhere like the Peninsula and suck up the price. If you're interested in a very nice, affordable place, go here. It might not be quite white-glove service, but it's definitely not anywhere close to Motel 6. Overall, we were extremely pleased with the hotel-the location was perfect (near shopping, and more importantly, right near the Jordan MTR station), the room was great, they were quite child-friendly, and overall made for a very pleasant stay in Hong Kong.

However I had to give it a go just once so I could compare it to other Novotel's stays in Hong Kong. Stayed on the Executive Floor here, as this hotel is cheaper than Century and Citygate . Cons: Check in was divided into Exec level and lobby reception. We should have gone straight up to Level 15.... our mistake as it took a full 20 mins to check in at the lobby. It was excruciatingly slow even though there were no other guests checking in at the time. The other perks associated with Exec Level are the continental breakfast, afternoon tea, evening cocktail hour and free Wi Fi in the room and lounge area. The internet came in handy as the terminals in the lobby were always occupied. The eating area was quite small and crowded in the morning if you chose the wrong time to turn up. The standard continental fare got you started for the day but was a little repetitive after the first day. Be wary, the reception guy pointedly looks at his watch before letting you in the lounge for the 1000 am cut off. We turned up at 0945! Did not get back for tea but tried the cocktail hour which did save some money on drinks and a few snacks. The room seemed no different than the floors below. Although the room was contemporary with space saving ideas, it felt small and closed in. Too much detail around the bed, a chaise lounge that we used to put clothes on as there was not a lot of space in the sliding wardrobe. This is a strange; dual set up as the door served to close the bathroom but left the light on in the wardrobe (not a very green idea). Also it flooded the room with light in the middle of the night if the bathroom door needed closing. Pros: Nice LCD TV on the wall, a great rain shower in the oversized glass area (although again, not a very water saving idea). Except for the drone of the lifts, the 15th floor was ultra quiet for a good night's sleep (a must for me in hotels) Other than the internet and drinks, I don't know that this level is worth the extra money. There is a range of eateries on Nathan Rd that may be more appetising for breakfast. The hotel location is great for the A21 CityFlyer bus from the airport. Stop #10 just a few metres from the side entry of the hotel in Saigon St. There is an underpass adjacent to the hotel that takes you across Nathan Rd to the A21 bus stop, # 8 back to the Airport (HKD $33.00 per person each way). Look for the yellow and red sign. We had an Octopus card that gives you access to this bus plus the MTR, other buses, trams and ferries. This saves time looking for exact change each time. Apart from a small handling fee, any excess left over can be refunded along with the HKD $50.00 deposit. This card is valid in so many other areas, (McDonalds for one) and it can be value added at most MTR stations. In a city this crowded, it makes a difference on how quickly you get from A to B. We kept ours for any future trips to HKG. The shopping from this hotel is an added bonus. If you turn left along Nathan Rd then you get to the main tourist area. Turn right and you can walk to Mongkok including the ladies market. Across and along a few streets is the Temple St night markets. This is not your typical tourist area and is crowded with local shoppers. There is a frenetic buzz all around. Would I stay again? Probably not as I do like to have some kind of view.

Check in was relatively painless, Transport: Several ways you can get the main area where these hotels are (Nathan, Eaton, Novotel). We chose the airport transfer bus, this took about 30mins and the stop is about 2mins walk away from the hotel which is pretty easy and cheap, I think it was about $15 one way. If anyone is considering the hotel coach service from the airport, you might want to consider getting a taxi instead. As it\u2019s about $200HKD a single journey, compared to about $140 pp on for a return trip on the coach service. Slightly dearer but on your own time and no need to rush, plus long distance rides taxi\u2019s tend to offer discount if you haggle. Being HK, your never far away from any public transport, with the location of the hotel it\u2019s close to the main mode of transport for us which is the subway (2mins walk away). Room: Large enough room with modern amenities, everything kept pretty clean and in good condition.

Walkable to the shopping districts in Mong Kok and Tsim Sha Tsui (although a short cab ride is probably more comfortable in the 30+ degree weather - usually about 20 HKD). Our package did not include breakfast, however, this was not a problem at all. Literally across the street from the hotel is a well known local congee and noodle place that we frequented often for our breakfast. It's also pretty tough to walk 2 blocks in any direction without running into any restaruants, and so there are many many eating options for you. No need to eat at the hotel, although the dinner buffet was very busy and looked very good with unlimited fois gras! Even some of the locals who were not staying at the hotel would come to eat the buffet dinner . The bar was also very popular, especially with world cup happening. The hotel was very kind in offering us free drink vouchers as our rooms were not ready upon checkin even though we showed up at noon, before our check in time. Our friend's had to change their rooms due to a maintenance issue, and they were given some more free drink vouchers. The computer stations that were available was very handy, allowing us to send emails to our families. Finally, the gym was very well equipped and I believe opened 24 hours a day.

Club room was nothing special, we expected more, as we paid more money to be in this room but we feel we paid too much for what we got. We had continental breakfast included in our room rate but it was disappointing. We had 7 breakfasts, every morning the same, no variety what so ever. Every day same ham, same sliced sausage, same cheese, couple of cereals, salmon and that was about it. First 2 or 3 days we had a choice of 3 cereals, after that was only 2, without cornflakes which we love the most. Be aware - no paper serviettes or serviettes of any kind, there was a box of tissues placed on the table which we were using instead!!! Never saw that at any previous hotels we've been at. Club Lounge is small and was couple of times so crowded that we have to come back later to have our breakfast. Complimentary afternoon tea ( which is complimentary with Club room ) was another disappointment. 1 choice of cake and every time same sandwiches with a bit of sliced sausage or ham and a cucumber. At the end we didn't bother anymore to go to afternoon teas! Cocktail Hour ( also complimentary from 5 - 7 daily ) was not too bad compare with Afternoon tea but we missed bread! Sample: there were marinated chicken wings or sliced roasted meat but no bread rolls or bread of any kind. We found it difficult to eat meat on its own so we usually bought some bread and took it with us. But we have to say there was plenty of drinks and as we don't drink much, we were happy with the selection of wine, beer and soft drinks. Highlight of our stay was room service which was great, room was always clean in tidy and so was the bathroom, always enough of shampoo, soap, conditioner, toilet paper and so on. Very good service indeed! Reception staff was polite if you spoke to them but it hardly happened that they will say \"Hi\" when they saw you. Usually they just looked at you without a word. The position of the hotel is great, Nathan Rd is great for shopping, many great shops and small shopping centres around as well as many restaurants, also close by is Ladies market and Night market which was great. Public transport is great, train and bus services all at your door step and also it is very cheap! We never used taxi, traffic is terrible and if we needed to go somewhere we went with train.

I've never set my foot in it's dining facilities since I'd love to experience HK taste, so no comment in this section. The location of the hotel is great. A short walk to MTR Jordan station. If you use the subway in front of the hotel to cross to another side of the street and walk about 5 minutes along Saigon Street, pass the market, for a few blocks, you will find a local roast goose and roast pork shop. Just walk straight down Saigon Street and cross the Canton Road and there it is!!! Shop owner can't speak English but you can point what you want. Its roast goose and roast pork are to die for!!! All by all, I love this hotel. The location is great. Nice staffs (by HK's standard) and comfortable room.

We were trying to see brand of bed cause we were so impressed and pleased with our sleep. Negatives: \u2022 When we first checked in the front desk staff was not very attentive. While we were in the process of checking in I think they were trying to find an available room. After 10 minutes of just standing there I asked him if everything was okay? He mumbled some response and didn\u2019t even look at me while he spoke, I was not impressed. I asked him again \u2013 same response. In the end he gave us a complimentary drinks voucher for the bar so i guess that made up for it. \u2022 Limited cable channels \u2022 No exhaust fan in the bathroom so room would fog up if you took a really hot shower \u2022 At times you can hear people from other rooms eg. very loud tv, loud conversations, people walking through the hall.

Location Less than 5 mins walk to the \"Jordan\" MTR station. Food is only minutes away and literally everywhere. You can either take bus / MTR or take a 10-15 mins walk to the Ocean Terminal in Tsim Sha Tsui for shopping. The location is fantastic and you don't pay Tsim Sha Tsui prices. Food Initially I was planning to go down to the lobby for breakfast / lunch as they have specials on. I am glad I didn't. This is HK which is food heaven, the last thing you want to try is hotel food. For breakfast, I went to a cafe opposite the hotel enterance (5 secs walk). That place has been there for over 30 years according to the owner. Ham / Egg sandwich with milk tea / coffee cost HK 22. Ham / egg Noodles with tea / coffee cost HK27. And it's actually nice. Walk an extra 5 mins and you can experience japanese food...etc Service The people are very polite and helpful and they speak decent english. There isn't much to elaborate here. There are 4 internet terminals (apple) that people can use. You can also apply for free 30 mins wifi access if you have laptop / iphone. Shopping Go to Citigate if you are after outlet shopping. Most of the stuff was 50% off when I was there. Ocean Terminal in Tsim Sha Tsui can help you in retail therapy if you are after a big shopping centre. Take a walk along nathan road and there are lots of invidual shops that might be of interest. Price The price I had was very good.

We barely had room to walk with our babies tent and our luggage but the facilities are very nice and we weren't spending much time in the room at all! The bed was super cozy and they had great pillows to choose from as well. We booked tours through the concierge which were very helpful. We went on the 1/2 day Hong Kong Orientation which was okay. Victoria Peak is Stunning but we had less than 30 min there, then onto the Fishing Village was wasn't really much of anything and a disappointment really and to a jewelery factory which we didn't realize was written in tiny print on the bottom. This part was ridiculous as nobody was rushed along here! Waste of time! We then finally went to Stanley Market where we only had a 1/2 hour again and no time to shop! At least we know where we want to go see again if we ever go back to Hong Kong! We went on the Sea and Land Whole Day Tour which was better than the previous day although the HArbour Cruise was longer than need be and the Dim Sum lunch albeit good wasn't proper Dim Sum where you could choose your dishes as they pass by. The Cable Car to the Big Buddha is a def do not miss! Stunning ride! The trip to the fishing village on the way home was really good too! We had breakfast at the hotel twice so we would only have to get a small lunch. The buffet is expensive but very filling and pretty good. Free internet in the lobby was really nice and the staff all warm and accommodating. We opted for 45 min back neck and shoulder massages before going home but don't bother, not sure the people are qualified and the \"spa\" is a little closet sized space.

The reason I chose it were due to its under Novotel (my fave chain hotel brand lately) and its rave reviews on Trip Advisor. And it was certainly a perfect hotel to stay in downtown Hong Kong. I loved it cause of its modern interior, comfy bed & pillows, super fast service (I should\u2019ve timed the seconds from the time you hanged up calling the housekeeping until they knocked on your door),walking distance up to 3-4 short blocks to Jordan MTR and bus stops along the main roads. Loved the room cause of its modern design, comfy king size beds and pillows guaranteed to make you sleep well, proper and good lighting (you have corner lights, table, reading lights). Bathroom was lovely too, bathtub was the perfect height, it didn\u2019t give you hassle to go in and out of it after shower. However, a tiny bit irritation was the placement of plastic holder for the amenities, it kept falling off when you were taking your shower, it would be nice if it\u2019s being put permanent to the steel holder. It even more memorable to us due to our \u2018new 2 fave\u2019 restaurants opposite the hotel, nothing beats local restaurants offering authentic and delicious locals food. We tried the breakfast in the hotel on 1st morning , it was alright but pricing definitely a bit steep and selection not a plenty. If you wish for a quick, cheap and hearty breakfast, it will be right opposite the hotel and we loved loved the Noodle selections (this was our 1st \u2018new fave) and for dinner (they don\u2019t open for breakfast), try the one next to 7-11, try the Dessert Selection, loved loved the Sesame Rice Ball and the Almond Milk Selection, Mango Pudding also a must try.

This was totally worth the extra money as you got a exclusive check-in area, unlimited access to the Web (2 PC's) , free bottled water, continental breakfast, afternoon tea and 2 hours of free bar. With 2 fussy teenagers it meant they could eat as much or as little as they wanted with no stress on our parts. My 19 year old particularly liked the free bar. We requested two adjoining rooms, 1 x double and 2 x single which were ready for us on our arrival. The rooms were not massive but the facilities in them made them appear smaller than they actually were. For example each of our rooms had a \"chaise- lounge\" to recline on but as it was 1m away from the bed, we never used it. The location was fantastic for all the Kowloon attractions, the night markets are 5 mins away and ladies market is a safe 15 min walk or MTR ride if you are tired. The nearest MTR station is only a few minutes walk. We used Taxi's and MTR to get around and as others have said, transport in HKG is relatively cheap and pain free to use. The MTR has to be one of the cleanest subway's I have ever seen. The staff were fantastic and could not do enough for you Across the road from the hotel entrance is a 7-11 so you can buy any drinks (juice, beer, wine) to take back to your room if you feel the need.

View from my room was not so nice but being in HK, it's normal. Internet worked fine in the room. Have a nice bar/piano bar (I didn't try but looked cosy). Close to the hotel, you have plenty of restaurants - lot of noodle soup shops and 'hole in the wall' restaurants. In the evening, if you take the underground path just outside the hotel, you will reach some busy area with seafood/crab outdoor and some 'tourist market'. Located in Kowloon, you have plenty of shopping malls walking distance. 15 min taxi drive to Central station. Hotel had a gym, looked quite busy but havent visited myself.

I stayed with my spouse and my daughter whose celebrating her birthday here. The hotel was easy to locate. I took an airport bus for more or less 30hkd for adults and half for my kid. As soon as we alight the bus, it was only less than 3 kms from the bus stop. it is across the jordan subway. Upon check in, we arrived 3 hours early for check in, the concierge willingly took our baggages, helped us carry it from 2f (hotel lobby) to the ground level. At the front desk, Phoebe checked our passport and we completed our registration. They took our credit card imprint for incidentals. I asked Phoebe hows the weather forecast for the rest of our stay for it was my daughters bday the ff day and we are planning to go to Disneyland. after giving us info, she gave my daughter a little reindeer stuffed toy as a birthday present. sweet indeed. it could be something small, but my 4yo daughter liked the attention. even the manager on duty greeted my daughter in advance. When we got back at pass 9pm to check in, i was surprised that they took care of our needs that I emailed a month before our check in. I even forgot that I have asked for a room far from the lift as to not disturb our sleep, the roll away bed is ready and prepared for my daughter, there are 2 big pillows for each of us and we have a room that has a tub. I believe we had an upgrade for free for we were advised early on that our unit has no tub. The room is abover average than other Hongkong hotels. We got 2 single beds. but the single bed's size is close to a double bed. our sleep was so comfortable, great big, comfy beds. functioning aircon. great blinds/ curtains and the rooms makes you think that you are the first one to use it. I like this better than the Prudential. In Prudential there are so many space but smaller beds. I won't be loitering in the bedroom anyway. But i will be lying down when I am inside as I am always out the rest of d day to go on sight seeing.Toilet is all that you could ask for. It has all the basics. There is a bowl of mentos candy on the reception, my daughter is very eager to get 1 everytime that we go down. And while I log in to the net for my free 30 min everyday, my daughter plays and read on the other side. they have a small kids corner with books than toys. walking distance to jordan MTR, Ferry bus and airport bus is all less than 5 min walk. night market at temple is so close. at the nathan hotel on the right block, 2f offers great, cheap dimsums. at the exact congee store across the hotel, they have the best congee at only 20-30 hkd. there are 2. try the one farther than 711. i can't remember the exact name. at the temple market try the dimsum eatery which is inside the chinese restaurant on the farthest right. this superb dimsum place is hidden. they are sharing space with 2 more chinese eateries that serves short order and they have the best hakao and siomai i have ever tasted in my life. 1 order is 30-35 each the stay was really great.

Another couple also were checked in late after arriving early afternoon. They paid for the extras package and ended up in the same size room.

It was constant durng the day and just loud enough to become very annoying. I was woken up at 6am every morning (we stayed 4 nights).

With a 4 year old in tow and the need to have a relax in the afternoon it would have been nice to have no 'droning'. Not to mention a sleep in on my holiday after days and nights of sight seeing. Anyway, I can only guess it was the service lift in the cleaners room next to our room. The occassional banging coming from the cleaners room as things were dropped or moved about I could put up with, but the constant droning was enough for me to never want to stay in that room again.

My room was actually oppossite a residential apartment. There's a LCD TV, stand in shower and nice amenities. The room is small (common for HK hotels) so if you have more than 3 adults, i recommend you get a bigger room or go to another hotel. There is a 7-11 just opposite the hotel - you can pick up magazines, drinks etc easily. I didn't have any meals at the hotel as there are nice cafes and a dessert stall just opposite the hotel. I requested for a late checkout and the reception was very accomodating. A 5 mins walk to the Jordan MTR. Cons: we took the airport express train (we hop onto the Tsuen Wan train at Central MTR) and it was challenging trip to the hotel. There was no lift to the street level - you have to carry your luggage up the stairs and down the stairs. So i suggest you either take a cab or take the airport bus. There isn't much shopping around the hotel area too. You have venture out to Mong Kok or TST or Central etc. Other than this, it is a nice hotel & i won't mind visiting it again.", "Date": "April 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and value for money\u201d", "Author": "kazataza", "ReviewID": "UR28117149", "Content": "Stayed for 4 nights at this hotel in early Apr on the 14th floor (the highest floor is 15th). Had booked the stays during the Accor Sale and paid less than HKD2600 for 4 nights. Pros: - Hotel is newly renovated. Hence all the rooms and designs are still very \"new\". Rooms come with Sony LCD TV, LED reading lights, etc. - Great location. Jordon MTR is just less than 5 mins walk away. - If you're taking the free airport express train shuttle bus, line K1 (which stop at Eaton) is just 2 streets away. It's just a short 3 mins walk. A21 bus stop is very near as well. We took a cab from the Kowloon station (of the airport express) to the hotel. Cost us HKD32 (note: HKD5 for our 1 piece luggage) - 7-11 is just across the hotel - Near to Temple Street, so no worries you're hungry at night - Complimentary internet access (20 mins per day). You have to obtain the password at the front desk. 4 MACs are available at the hotel lobby for use as well. Cons:- - Gym is small and no swimming pool (if these are important considerations for you when choosing a hotel). - No bath tub for the room that I'm staying - Room is not very big. This is quite typical for HK hotels. I'd stayed in Kowloon Hotel before and its far worse than Novotel", "Date": "April 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel and location\u201d", "Author": "mmyk72", "ReviewID": "UR28100100", "Content": "Others have written that the rooms are small, but I disagree. By HK standards, the size is very comfortable. I had a twin room (2 beds), which fits 2 adults nicely. The beds are placed close to each other with a small gap in the middle. There's enough space for luggage and we certainly don't feel squeezed into a box like other HK hotels I've heard of. The lobby and room feel new and is tastefully furnished. Bed/pillow are comfortable and linen is fresh and clean. The bath has a modern chic look. I love the walk-in shower (others may not like this if they have children) except the shower water doesn't go into the drain very quickly. The way the bath door closes is clever but a bit weird. It slides back and forth and serves both the bathroom and the closet. It's a bit annoying that the closet light stays on as long as the closet is open. Bottled water is provided. Since you can't just drink out of the facuet in HK, I usually use more than the 2 bottles supplied. Housekeeping sounds a bit reluctant everytime I call for more, but they still bring additional bottles nevertheless. My view is not that great (not facing the main street and into some old building not too far away). But I don't think that's a big deal. The windows do block out all the sound and has great slide down shades. Air conditioning is not super cool. I end up setting the temp to 15C just to keep it going. Otherwise the fan kicks on without cooling and the humidity builds up (this was not even in the summer). Location is super as others have said. I actually prefer this area more than the more touristy section in Tsim Sha Tsui. Here, you can walk a few steps and join the locals for food, shopping, etc. If you are arriving by bus, you get off at the same stop as Eaton Hotel. The hotel entrance is in a side street. The Wing On Department store across Nathan Rd is a good landmark. There are a lot of local restaurants, so I did not eat in the hotel at all (my room did not incl free bkf). In HK, you can easily have breakfast for under US $5. No need to pay the hefty hotel price. I agree that lobby service is not super great. But, I didn't expect much more (it's not like this is a 5 star hotel). The internet is free for 20 min at the computer terminals in the lobby (I think there are 6 Mac's for use). I got my own computer connected to wifi with no time limit in the lobby (maybe I was lucky?). Printing is HKD $5 per page, which I thought was ridiculous. Overall, this is a great hotel without the outrageous pricetag. It's a solid choice. One thing I should complement the hotel on: I left a small electrical converter plugged in at the desk and didn't realize it until after I checked out. I called the hotel back and they found the item and kept it for me at the front desk so that when I returned to the hotel, they instantly gave it back to me. That's pretty efficient.", "Date": "April 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "vancouver", "Title": "\u201cgood safe choice\u201d", "Author": "brookea", "ReviewID": "UR27009353", "Content": "The hotel was renovated not too long ago,so everything was quite new.

It is 5 minutes to Temple St night market, close to Mongkok & Yau Ma Tei where goods and food are cheaper than the main tourist area of Tsim Sha Tsui. The MTR metro train station of Jordon is just acound the corner, and the bus stop is right outside the hotel in Nathan road. To get to the Star Ferry terminal which will take you across Hong Kong harbour to the main Island , you can walk or take a 10 minute bus ride. Walking will give you insite into the wide varierty of shops and restaurants which are open to 11pm in the evening. The hotel rooms are larger than the average Hong Kong Hotel room, and is clean and functional, as the hotel was only renovated a couple of years ago. Unfortunately there is no swimming pool, and the gym is very small, but as you are probably out shopping/sightseeing, you probably will not have much chance to use these facilities. Walking in Hong Kong is the best way to see it, and you will get fit at the same time . The Premier floor that we stayed on provides free breakfast , free Internet access ( broadband in room ), afternoon tea and drinks in the evening, all in the one room charge.

The rooms sizes were not that big but enough for 2-3 person and their quite new or they just know how to maintain it that well.

It's newly renovated and just had their grand opening on Mid March 2008. So when I was there for 6 nights in late March, it was a brand new hotel, we still could smell the paint and the new furnitures. It was a pretty good experience there, although we started a little bit rough. It was when our room wasn't ready when we checked in ( although we'd paid our total bill in advance when we did the booking and it wasn't an early check in ) and we had to wait for 1 hour. But when we looked our room for the first time, we really liked it. It was really modern room, smaller than the impression we got from the hotel's photo, but it was really pretty. They gave spares of almost everything, from soaps to tissue papers. They even prepared what they called a la carte pillows, meaning you can choose the tenderness of pillows you want. The first morning, we got The South China Post which was very good. However, the next 4 morning, the sent us The Standard which was very thin and it turned out to be free copies. The last morning we got The South China Post again. We thought maybe that morning the hotel couldn't find any free newspaper that could save them a little money. Although I dont think giving the guests proper newspaper will cost them a fortune, but saving is saving. Apart from these, the hotel was really nice. The location is just perfect. It's in the middle of Nathan road where we can find anything. The famous Temple Street Market is just across the road through the subway, and even the subway is literally in front of the hotel door. The Jordan MTR station is just max 3 minutes away. 7Eleven and lot of local restaurants are just across the street. And Starbucks is 1 minutes away. For the money value, it's just perfect. The hotel is positioned next to Eaton and Nathan Hotel, but it's cheaper than the 2 neighbours.
