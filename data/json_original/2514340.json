As it was a bussines travel I decided to stay at Gresham B&B, it was the near the place I had to be the next day. The whole experience was horrible. The smell in the room was horrible, but it was very late so I decided to go for it, and that was a huge mistake. I was tired after all day travelling so I decided to rest on the bed for a while. After 5 mins I start hearing weird sounds coming from the wall, it was clearly a mouse. I went downstairs and one of the staff at the hotel came up to have a look. When he was checking under the carpet we found two holes. He said that he was going to fix it so after 2 mins he came back with wood to cover the hole. I didn\u00b4t like that. I asked for another room and he said that he didn\u00b4t have any other room available. After one hour there the mice were getting more and more lauder, I could hear them running from the toilet to the window. It was disgusting. So I took my suitcases and went downstairs asking for my money back cos I was leaving. That room didn\u00b4t have the minimum requirements to sleep there!! The concierge asked to wait for the manager. At this point he offered me another room!! and 1h ago he said that there were no rooms availables!!!! While I was waiting I could hear the concierge laughing while telling what was happening to other people. It was unrespectul!! When the manager arrived he asked me to double check the room along with him, I said NO, I don\u00b4t want to go there anymore, I had enough...He got very agressive and started to scream at me saying that there were not rats in his hotel. He got very agressive. When I asked for my money or at least part of it, he asked how many hours did I spend in the room...I said 3 hours and he said...well I am not refunding the money very unpolite and screaming. I told him that it was not fair as I paid for a B&B and I didn\u00b4t use the Bed or either the breakfast. So I paid 50 pounds for that and I didn\u00b4t spend the night there. Ah yes, at some point he said that what I was hearing was the squirols in the garden...hahaha...how on earth is that a squirol if I could hear it running from the toilet to the window!!! After 10 minutes arguing he was very aggresive and I got scared so I just left. I do not recommend this B&B.

I booked the hotel direct over the phone; the service was very nice and helpful. I chose this hotel with the pictures from the internet, at \u00a362 for one night, this seemed to be very inexpensive!!!!!! Saying that, there was no confirmation of the booking. After getting into London 2 hours late, we couldn't wait to get to the room for some sleep. At reaching the hotel the first impressions were good! Nice and clean looking appearance to the building and the surrounding area was beautiful!! All this changed though as we entered the hotel, the staff were very nice and the reception was clean and tidy, the only part of the hotel that was!!!! We got the room key and proceeded to get to the room, after 5 minutes of messing around with the elevator, we eventually got to the floor we wanted. I entered the room to see what I could only describe as FILTH!!!!! The carpet were worn through and covered in manky disgusting stains, the wall paper was hanging off in places, there was a leak in the roof, you could see the leak running down the wall!!!!!! The bed was completely unusable, I laid on it and the mattress was non existent, the bedding was holed and stained. You couldn't sleep on it even if you were drunk. I entered the bathroom to be met with the disgusting smell of sureage; something was far from right in this place, Within 2 minutes of entering the room, I was on the phone to another hotel wanting a room with them!!!!! To say I\u2019ve stayed in rooms costing \u00a340 and 10 times better, \u00a362 is a complete rip off!!!!!!!!!!! We went straight for the reception, they were apologetic to say the least, there excuse was that the 4th floor was under refurbishment BUT we were on the 1st floor!!!!!! I didn't even entertain looking at another room, all I wanted was to get my money back and leave. To there credit, they didn't argue, they said sorry and gave me a full refund. We walked 30 secs down the road, looked at another hotel, the rooms were cheaper and far far better.

First mistake - thought that I had booked the Gresham Hotel in Hyde Park - which is a separate chain and where I had stayed before and enjoyed. Room I was allocated on the 4th floor was a small loft room. Carpets were dirty, bed cover had human hair present but worse was to come.. On getting ready for bed, I pulled back the sheets and was absolutely horrified to find the bed was infested with mites. Unfortunately because it was too late to book out, I had to complain to management and seek an alternative room. It was at the complaint stage that I found out that Westminister Council had already treated the room previously for infestation!!! I was moved to another room but as you can imagine, the whole experience was not conducive to sleep. I had to settle for a discount when a total refund was refused. I gave breakfast a miss the next morning and got out of there as fast as possible.

From the outside the hotel looks okay, but as soon as you step into the foyer, and your eyes take in the 1970s wood panelling and the built-in reception booth, you know it's going to be an experience. The chap on reception was very helpful and friendly, no complaints there, then he gave us the key - we were staying in the \"annexe\". Once we had been let in through the security door, battled with the dodgy yale lock and narrowly avoided concussion from the massive keyfob, we could take in the splendour of our room: dirty carpets; curtains hanging off the rails; two windows - one of which had no catch or lock or anything, so anybody could just slide the window up and come on in. Not that they'd want to. We paid \u00a375 for the night, which included breakfast and \"en suite\". This was basically a cupboard with a loo, basin and shower cubicle, in a stunning shade of pale khaki, squeezed in. As it was so hot that weekend, I had four or five showers. Usually I would avoid a shower cubicle with a door that swings open every minute, a shower that doesn't actually stay in the holder on the wall and suspect looking black fungus-style patches in the corners. I wish I'd taken flip-flops as the whole room had the air of desperation, decay and dirt. As you can imagine, we avoided the breakfast and, judging from other reviews on here, that was a damn good descision! Oh, and we couldn't get one station on the television - surely London should get good tv reception? On a final note... I've been ill ever since I stayed there and have just found out that my symptons are similar to the NHS Direct description of Legionnaires' disease. That'll be from the shower, then.
