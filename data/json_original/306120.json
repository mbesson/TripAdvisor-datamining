Since then I've always returned because I find what I need in this pricey city with its hot climate: location, pool, comfortable bed and quite affordable price. It's very true that the hotel deadly needs a renovation. Rooms are tiny but again, the bed is comfortable, and we can enjoy large views of the skyline and green space. TV programs aren't bad. I've seen tinier rooms in Hong Kong. What is special is the bathroom. It is the smallest I've ever seen. First time visitors, be ready to that. Yet there is still a WC, a sink and a shower with a curtain. The swimming pool is at the 4th floor if I remember. Yes this is small but you can have it just for yourself most of the time. Use the heavy waterfall to massage your back! If your room is nearby you can walk directly to/from the pool. Very cool, isn't it? The reception is, well, not the warmest in the world. Nothing to complain about, though. The buffet breakfast is the same every morning but you'll be full before leaving the hotel. The dining room is pretty pleasant and bright. It is also possible to eat outside. The location is the big plus of the hotel, just near Clarke Quay and in front of the river. Numerous restaurants and bars are nearby. This is where people go to chill out night time and during the week-end. No need to take taxi or MRT after dinner, just a 5 min walk. Clarke Quay MRT is nearby. You can even walk until the Merlion through Boat Quay. If you like food courts, the Maxwell Food Centre in Chinatown (with its famous Tian Tian Chicken Rice) is at 5 min by taxi.

The bathroom is tiny and you can't swing a cat. There is no exhaust fan in there -- it's outside the door. Not much use when you want to use the toilet. The sheets were changed daily which was a surprise. The hotel style is circular built in the atrium model. Thus it's very noisy as noise echoes throughout , especially will people slamming doors. Also there are no smoking floors which really are useless because smoke can enter the open atrium and filter everywhere. Breakfast is VERY basic and the choices do not alter from day to day.

I am a frequent visitor to Asia and as Singapore is getting incredibly expensive, I opted for this hotel because of its reasonable price. I read the TripAdvisor reviews before booking but took the advice of one of my local business contacts who told me I couldn't do better in terms of price or location. She was right. I had some concerns having read some of the negative comments here but I was worried unnecessarily. I was in a room on the 6th floor overlooking the Singapore River, the river walk and the park. I opted to pay five dollars Singapore a night supplement for a room with a queen sized bed and it was worth every penny. The room wasn't huge but it wasn't poky either. It was refurbished, clean, comfortable and the aircon worked well (an absolute necessity in Singapore) without sounding like a Saturn V rocket blasting off for the moon. The bed was comfortable and the linen, which was spotless, was changed daily - as were the towels. The shower/bathroom is small but again perfectly clean and functional with none of the mould and smell described in other reviews. Most people stay at the Robertson Quay for only a couple of days before moving on. Singapore as a tourist destination is of limited appeal (unless you are obsessed with buying overpriced luxury fashion in yet another OTT shopping mall) and all the sights and sites can be done in two or three days. As I was on a two week work assignment I got to know the hotel and its staff far better than others would and I found them to be helpful, friendly and polite if slightly reserved at first - but that's an ethnic Chinese thing, not rudeness. Sure the breakfasts get monotonous but that would be the case anywhere after a fortnight but they are substantial, filling and good. Usually a rice dish, eggs in various formats (omelette, fried, scrambled, boiled etc) baked beans, sausages (or rather frankfurters), white and brown bread/toast. butter, jam. orange juice, fruit, (fresh and preserved), yoghourt, tea, coffee. Plus the daily papers in English, Chinese and Malay. The dining room, which is up a few steps from the small reception area, is a bit dark and noisy because it is predominantly cool tiles over stressed concrete but it is perfectly functional. The hotel gets a lot of backpackers and families with children but the corridors were quiet at night and there were no disturbances. During the day mountains of luggage are housed temporarily on staging opposite reception, but these heaps dwindle during the day as groups head-off to the airport. The hotel's location is perfect. The walk along the river to Clarke Quay (left and then left again out of the hotel) takes about three minutes to where there is a huge choice of bars and restaurants. It's tourist trap and therefore pricey but it buzzes at night. To the right along the river is Robertson Quay, which is posher, quieter and attracts fewer tourists. Again there is a great selection of bars and restaurants that tend to be patronised by local residents (ex-pat and indigenous). Of course, all locations are perfectly safe. Criminals in Singapore get harsh prison sentences with \"special\" hard labour regimes for violent offenders while floggings, canings and hangings are commonplace. Offences against the person of visitors, tourists and foreign workers are very rare indeed and the police are tough and efficient. You get what you pay for in Singapore and you can pay a lot - apart from taxis which are ubiquitous and cheap as is the excellent subway system. I have stayed in hotels there that have been hugely expensive but by no means any better than the Robertson Quay. It's a rare bargain in a city state that is now becoming one of the most expensive destinations on the planet. I'll certainly be staying at the Robertson Quay Hotel again later in the year.", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cThe only thing going for this hotel is \"Location\"\u201d", "Author": "chey88", "ReviewID": "UR115345073", "Content": "Dont stay here! If you think your getting a bargain (like I thought with breakfast inclusive) you will be sadly mistaken. The pictures are very misleading and nothing looks anything like it does on the website. The entrance is fill of luggage which makes it difficult to get to reception. I was there a total of 8 days and every day the front entrance was crowded. They charged extra to clean the rooms and replenish the towels, but honestly I thought that would be standard practise! I asked for extra pillows which were brought up for one day and taken back the next. We spent lots of time in the pool as it is very hot [day and night] and so we asked for additional towels which were also taken back everyday until I told front reception to leave extra towels and pillows in the rooms until we left. The pool is nothing like it looks in the pictures, very small and a maximum height of 1.2mtrs. The wall paper and ceilings are ripped, chipped and very mouldy smelling. The toilet/shower/bathroom is the size of a tiny linen cupboard, actually a linen cupboard is probebly bigger. Lets just say when your in the shower you can touch the sink and the flush the toilet at the same time....NOT GOOD. The whole place is very grotty, dusty and out dated. I cant speak harshly enough about the breakfast. The lady cooking the food looks like she isnt happy to be there and makes gestures when you go to get food. The menu was pathetic: rubbery, tasteless scrambled eggs that resembled chewing on an old tyre, canned baked beans, over cooked steamed sausages and bread with nothing more than butter and some sort of fruit spread. Every day the same thing. The people come and clean your table before you've finished eating and take your utensils and if your not there by 10 am on the dot you miss out.

The beds are good, breakfast is more than enough and the hotel is clean. The swimming pool area is beautiful. The staff are not over friendly, but that you see throughout Singapore.

The 2 men at reception just sat there and stared at us. Didn't offer to help me even move the bag to the lifts. The rooms are very tiny. We were in a room with 2 single beds - they were actually too long for the area they were in, and intruded into the passage way in the room. The bed linen smelled, had several stains, holes, and cigarette burns. There was no place to put your bags (except between the beds). Which made it impossible to move about the room. The safe did not work (probably because the whole front panel had been ripped off it), the TV did not work. There was no shower curtain which led to everything in the tiny bathroom getting wet (towels, toilet paper etc etc) I paid for the wireless internet in the room, only to discover it would not actually pick up a signal in the room. I could only get a signal when I was in the hallway. Breakfast was OK. Not very much variety though.

Everything was ok (nothing spectacular) during check in. While the room was small, I thought that it was still value for the rate. HOWEVER, the whole experience changed during breakfast the next day. Firstly, there were not enough tables and chairs for the guests of the hotel - so we were requested to sit outside which is fine if not for the fact that the chairs and tables outside are all tied up, making it dificult for us to sit there. As the outside area was quite far away from the buffet breakfast area, we requested for a tray so that it's easier for us to carry our food; which was met with a look of disgust particularly by the lady who was manning the food counter. She very rudely asked us for our room number loudly and told us to bring the tray back (again in a loud and impatient manner). We could still tolerate the rough treatment at that point but the pinnacle of it was when I was taking 2 cups of coffee on my tray and at the same time decided to pour some soy sauce into a bowl for hardboiled eggs. To manage the situation, I put the tray momentarily on the banquet table just next to me and proceeded to pour the soy sauce very quickly - upon which i heard a loud, rude and commanding voice saying \"MADAM, PLEASE GET THE TRAY OF THE TABLE AND CARRY IT TO YOUR OWN TABLE\". Now, she could see I was pouring the soy sauce which will take only less than 1 min, plus my table is outside of the area which is a bit far - why could she not have asked in a more polite and appropriate manner if really it is against the hotel policy to put the tray there. But the point is it was not obstructing anyone or causing any inconvenience plus it will only take a moment to do what I am supposed to do before i go off to my table. It was not exactly a pleasant experience to be shouted to in front of all the guests. I could only say that my friend and I have been to other hotels, both budget and non-budget. While I do not have high expectations for RQ as it is cheaper, I also do not expect to be treated rudely!

On arrival at 8 pm we were met with a smile and were quickly checked in to our room on the top floor (10th). While the room was small it was clean, tidy and had all the basics. Tea/coffee/fridge/tv/room safe and a hair dryer what more could you need. The air conditioner was great and very refreshing when coming in from the tropical heat outside. Our bags fitted perfectly on the window ledge and off the floor leaving plenty of room to walk around the queen size bed. We only wanted the room to sleep and shower in so it met all our needs. The bathroom is a little cramped (I'm a heavy build) but there was plenty of room to shower and the water was hot with plenty of pressure. The bed was firm and there were only two thin pillows we didn't need anymore but you could ask for more if you wanted too. The hotel is located 1 minute walk from 15 restaurants in Robertson Quay and a relaxing 10 minutes walk from 30 Clark Quay restaurants. Breakfast was plain fare and the same every day consisting of toast, cereal, omlete or fried eggs, sausage, baked beans, fried rice, tea and coffee at SGN$8, not a bad price considering the cost of a coffee and quiche at a Starbucks. The pool is small but clean and it could do with some more deck chairs, the spa is big enough for 6-8 people but the decore in the gym/spa room was very poor. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful with directions to local attractions. Cabs are remarkably cheap and the MRT is 15 mins walk from the hotel. On the down side because the rooms are small theres no chair to lounge around in. The breakfast area had a couple of comfy chairs to sit in but its a bit far from the room. The shopping center across the road has a supermarket where you can buy booze a bit cheaper than reception and if you walk around the corner past the restaurants there's a dry cleaner thats cheaper than the hotels laundry service. A shopping hint for those new to Singapore, most shops and department store dont open before 10 am. On our last day we checked out with no problems and were able to leave our bags at reception while we went out for our last shopping adventure, upon our return we were offered free use of the Spa/gym showers to freshen up and change into fresh clothes before heading off to the airport.

If you have a couple suitcases you have to put them on the window ledge or continually step over them moving around the room. No chance of having a queen or king sized bed in the room because they wouldn't fit in the room. After the initial shock of the size of the room I decided to check the bathroom. I've seen cupboards that are bigger! To say they are tiny is a gross understatement. If you are on the large size, I didn't say fat, but read it how ever you like, you will have difficulty especially in the shower, where its tough to turn around without hitting the sides or the door.

Bed was small but compfy but we were not completely relaxed due to linen having worn out discoloured old look/feel plus the headboard was really obviously dirty.

Unless your idea of a hotel room is somewhere you can sit in an easy chair or sofa while you put your feet up on the coffee table, This place is the place to stay. You couldn't pick a better location in Singapore. It is right on the esplanade along the Singapore River and only a 5 minute walk from the MTR station. It is half the price of other hotels in the same area, and with good reason ... the rooms are very small and basic. Think stateroom, not hotel room. The guy I was traveling with was a fellow retired naval officer. Both of us remarked how much the room reminded us of our staterooms on Navy ships. They had everything you needed and nothing extra. The room was small, the beds were comfortable and the bathroom was \"compact\" but held all the necessities. (don't think free shower caps and hand lotion ... I mean toilet, sink, and shower) There was a TV, a telephone, and internet access. What else do you need?

We decided to stop in Singapore via Perth from our trip around Europe to relax, hence why we booked a hotel with a pool. This pool looked huge on the website, but when we got up there, boy was it a big let down. It was so small, nothing like the website.

The bathroom was basicaly a shower and a toilet, mismatching colours. Also has cigarette smoke blowing through the air condioning vents at night. Windows looked dirty and needed cleaning. There was a kettle in each room. One of the rooms had ants crawling over the kettle. This is a room on the 5th floor.There is a pool suitable for infants on the 3rd floor.
