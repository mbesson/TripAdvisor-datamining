Don't stay here! Don't stay here! Stay away at all costs. If this is the only line of my review you read, please listen to it. The owner is being purposely deceptive with his website, I'm sure to distance himself from the bad reviews here. I checked TripAdvisor and didn't see anything about Kensington Court Aparthotel. I booked the 2 bedroom place for 4 nights, at 200 pounds a night. We had been traveling for 3 weeks without being able to wash clothes, so that was one of the sellers for this place. I also liked the free wifi, the location and love quirky old places that don't have a hotel feel. However, I had a bad feeling about it right after I booked and found the reviews of Kensington Park Apartments and realized they were the same place. I tried to cancel my reservation, but I would have had to forfeit 1/2 the total, even though it was only 15 minutes later. We bit the bullet and went anyway, hoping for the best. When we arrived, the owner said he had upgraded us to a 2 bedroom 2 bath place instead. Room 13 was on the top floor, a flight of stairs above the elevator. The flight of stairs was narrow, but he had still managed to cram a mattress in it (see pictures).The website says there is a lift to all floors, an outright lie. He told us we could choose between that one and the one we had booked, a 2 bedroom 1 bath on the 1st floor, room 8 and room 13. Room 8 was tiny, 2 rooms with only enough room for a double bed and no walking space and a miniscule kitchen. We opted for room 13 and lugged our stuff up there. We were dismayed to find stained carpet, walls and furniture. There were holes in the walls and sheets, green globs on the wall and ceiling, flaking paint on the windows and a stain on the wall where someone had thrown a wet clothing item (a shirt?) which was still wedged between the wall and the desk. We were provided with 4 thin and tiny towels and never had replacements. The satellite TV didn't work, so we only had a few channels. The \"Video Entry System\" promised on the website is a mystery to me, is that a DVD player? The wifi didn't work and the owner wasn't available to ask. He basically disappeared after we paid, maybe to go spend our money. We tried to use the washer and it didn't spin, so after all that research to find a place with a washer, we were out of luck. The dryer didn't work either and we had to hang our clothes all around the apartment in order to dry them. We had a problem finding parking and called the owner about it. He was rude on the phone and told us to figure it out on our own. I mentioned that there were holes in the sheets and said, \"Yes, that's because they're old.\" Really?! Then he proceeded to tell us what a great deal we were getting - 3 rooms! The owner has clearly spent his money on a slick website to lure people in, including using the names Kensington Park Apartments and Kensington Court Aparthotel. The pictures may have been accurate 20 years ago, but now are a parody of what's actually in the rooms. The reception area shown on the website is a complete fiction, borrowed from some other website, surely. The website promises maid service 2 times a week, but we never saw any signs a maid had been in to clean. The full kitchens promised are tiny. Two people can stand in the kitchen, but if one bends over, they're bumping into the other person. The topper to our 4 days of staying in this rathole firetrap was at checkout. We had called a cab and it was waiting at the curb. We hauled our stuff back down the tiny stairs, past the mattress to the elevator several times. The proprietor was at the desk, but never spoke to us, even when we couldn't get the elevator past the 1st floor on our final load. We were yelling progress reports up and down the stairs, so he surely heard us. I ran up the stairs for a final look through the pit and missed the owner shoving my husband out of the way while saying, \"What did you do to my elevator?\" - an accusation instead of help. Then he proceeded to verbally harrass my husband, who finally snapped and told him that this was the worst place we had stayed in five months of travel (true). The owner just said, \"I don't want to hear bad things about my place.\" I'm sure that's all he hears! The saddest thing is that this could be a great place if it was cared for properly. It is like watching a beautiful old lady rot from cancer. This is a lovely old building in a great block. There are embassies all around. And it is most quiet, barring being on the flight path to Heathrow.", "Date": "August 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWorse hotel experience thus far\u201d", "Author": "statusquo81", "ReviewID": "UR107506973", "Content": "We arrived early to ensure that we would get a full day of activities.

The worse bit came later, an unapologetic hotel manager ordered a plumber to take care of this and offered us a new room. We decided it was not worth the effort, as we, despite being out looking for a new hotel room 4 in the morning, actually managed to find a reasonably priced and infinitely more accommodating alternative.

First of all, the photos on the property's website are not what will greet you upon check-in. The apartment we had was threadbare with dirty and stained carpets, stained sofa, chairs, and headboard. The draperies were falling off the hooks in the bedroom and it needed a fresh coat of paint and DEEP cleaning . However, there was a nice table in the sitting room. There were no lights in the stairwell except for 2 table lamps placed on the floor on the first landing and the second on approximately the 3rd or 4th landing. My friends and I left for a few days and returned because we had already paid in advance and knew that we would be out of luck if we asked for a refund, so we decided to just make the best of it. Upon our return, we were directed to the same apartment with the instructions that if we wanted our sheets changed we were welcome to do it ourselves. We walked into the apartment and the odor of trash hit us--the full trash bags had been sitting in the kitchen the entire time along with all the dirty towels in the bathroom, Basically, it was in the exact condition as when we had checked out 4 days previously. Another problem was the $50 charge per night for 2 nights for a friend leaving her luggage with us. We felt this charge was just a way to \"gouge\" us for more money. The management felt that since the luggage was in our room (one small carry-on size suitcase) and that it had been opened and left on the floor, that the person had slept in our room. We completely understood paying for the extra person if that had been the case but she did not stay with us. She merely brought her suitcase to put some clothes in it that we had brought her from the States. Plus, the manager saw her walk in with the suitcase and never asked us about it until she came the next day to retrieve it. Then he tried to get her to pay the money. She refused and a big fuss ensued. We were prepared for this problem thanks to the previous posts concerning difficulties with the management. We tried a different approach and did our best to work it out with them. As a result, they reduced the charge to $50. However, it would not have mattered how much they would have reduced it, we will NEVER recommend or stay in this DUMP again. One final note: The morning after our arrival, an elderly couple were checking out because of the conditions of the accommodations. They and their daughter found it totally disgusting and asked for a refund. They went elsewhere to stay. I know that the management will disagree with this review as they have with all other negative reviews.
