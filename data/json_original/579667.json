There was however a cafe on the next block which was run by a very friendly family who served excellent tea/coffee and good inexpensive meals ( eating out in Barcelona can get very expensive).

From the outside it looks fairly nondescript and the entry foyer could do with some TLC. We were wondering what to expect and on entering the Hotel decided that we couldn't expect much. We were pleasantly surprised when we opened the door to our room on the ground floor at the back of the hotel. The room was spacious, clean, with a large comfortable bed, was well equipped and because it was on the ground floor the bathroom had been renovated to enable a person in a wheelchair to access it easily. There was a reverse cycle air conditioner in the room because the window could not be opened, and this provided us with cool air when needed. For the price, we think we had an excellent room in a Hotel with 24 hour reception, in a very convenient yet quiet location. Reception staff at the hotel were helpful and friendly. All of them spoke English. Two doors down from the hotel was a very popular cafe/bar/restaurant that offered coffee and croisants for 2 euros or omelette, coffee and toast for 2 euros 65 cents. We made use of this very friendly establishment because the hotel did not provide breakfast. Across the road from the cafe was an internet outlet that charged 1 euro for one hour of internet use. As we used the internet for only 30 minutes, we were charged 50 cents for the privilege. Between the railway station and the hotel is a very large supermarket that provided everything from groceries to hardware to clothing. The popular tourist hop on hop off sightseeing buses stop at \"Sants\".", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Graz, Austria", "Title": "\u201cVery good location, small room\u201d", "Author": "L-i-Y-i-A", "ReviewID": "UR122647140", "Content": "I went there when they were renovating.

It was just large enough to hold a small single bed, a wardrobe and a small chair - not an armchair. The attached toilet and bathtub were just adequate for mis-shapen dwarfs. It was one of the most basic hotels I had ever stayed in during my 50 years of travel. The air-conditioning occasionally produced some very loud and most worrisome noises. Despite repeated complaints, the staff were unhelpful.Since the small and very old TV receiver did not respond to the remote unit, I complained about it. A man came over to check. He informed me that it could only be started by pressing the button on the receiver, and not remotely. That TV switch was almost a foot beyond my tip-toe reach. Result: No TV for 7 nights. Thereafter, I did not even bother to complain - though there was a lot to complain about. The blanket had been cut and slashed by some previous disgrunted guest - and had not been replaced. Small patches of paint had pealed from the sidewall and ceiling. There were large black ants in the basin and toilet, though the room staff took care of them after the second day. There was no bath mat and not even a soap holder with the bathtub. The wardrobe door would not shut tight. It was a bare-bones hotel witrh the barest min9imum of facilities. It had also been difficult to locate on the first day. Considering these points, and the fact that no breakfast was offered, The charge of Euro 54 a night was truly extortionate.

When we first arrived we were shown to room 109, but when we got into room we noticed that the lock on the window had been tampered with and you could gain access onto roof and therefore into room. We asked to change due to security reasons and we were moved without hesitation to room 406. Overall, the rooms are small and the shower has little power, with either scalding water or freezing water. The rooms are paper thin and you can hear every noise, alot of broken sleep!! I dont think I would stay here again due to the discomfort of it but it is a great location for sightseeing Barcelona. I would also say that it is very expensive in Barcelona and I found the choice of food very poor. All i ate for lunch and dinner was pizza or baguettes. They offer alot of seafood but if you are not a lover of seafood like me then you are limited to what you buy!! The cost of beers vary enormously. We found a local cafe bar near the hotel which was 1.60 euros for a bottle of estrella but 2 doors down in the pizza place it was 4 euros for a pint!!

This gave an impression of some sort of squatters accomodation. After finding my room and opening the door the quality of the room matched the quality of the hallway. The bedding looked about 10 years old and was terribly creaky. There was a sink in the room as it would not fit in the place that was meant to be a bathroom.
