No water in the room (actually not even a glass). You are asked to pay \u20ac6 per day to use wi-fi but as this service is outsourced we were told that if it failed we would not get reimbursed. The most disturbing part of it all is that the hotel allows anyone onto the property. There were very suspicious people walking around the halls, and we were kept awake until 3am by a group of men yelling and banging on doors throughout the hallway.

We needed a budget hotel which was clean and safe and that is what we got. Staff were fine and breakfast was good. Japanese students were a bit loud at night but hey, they are kids having fun........a quiet word and they were good as gold. Don't let the ramshackle market outside the front doors put you off. The hotel is in a perfectly decent residential area and the bus links excellent. Yes it would be more convenient if it was located closer to the sights. A bit more guidance for getting to the hotel the first time on public transport, especially if you are arriving in the dark like we were. So you catch the train from the airport which is faster than the bus, and then buy your week metro/ bus pass from a machine and take the metro line A, direction Battistini. Easy! But there are at least six exits from the Ottaviano metro stop and roads going in four directions. You need to take the exit labelled via Grand Cesare AND via Barletta. Then at street level the bus stop (Fermato) for the number 32 going in the direction you need is on a raised pavement sort of in the middle of the road (normally lots of other people with you). As you stand at the stop looking across the road you will see the Ciociaro Restaurant. Previous contributors have said count 16 stops which is not helpful if the bus misses stops! Better look out for a drive through Mc Donalds on your right a few hundred metres after which the bus turns right up a hill. Then the stop you need for the hotel, Flaminia Bevagna is approximately the second stop. There is a Barclays Bank on your right and a high school wall on your left. You can try asking the driver but they are protected with a screen which is a bit intimidating! If you get off too soon it is not so far to walk to the top of the hill. To get to the hotel turn down the side road adjacent to the Barclays Bank and walk say 500 metres until you get to a market square (empty at night). You will see the hotel across the square. It seemed a very safe area to us.

Each morning there was a choice of cereal, yoghurt, rolls, bread, cheese, ham, salami, a variety of cakes e.g. croissants, pain chocolat, doughnuts, chocolate cake etc., tea and coffee - and as much of it as you could eat! There was a hairdrier in the bathroom, the shampoo and soap was replenished frequently and the balcony was big enough to sit out on - it even had a distant view of the mountains. Yes, it is quite far from the centre but this really isn't a problem as the 32 bus stop is very close (takes you to the Vatican) or if you walk down to the main road, you can catch the 81 which will drop you near the Colosseum. From the 32 bus stop (terminus) you can either walk past St Peter's, over the bridge to a number of nearby sights e,g.Pantheon, Piazza Navona (Restaurant Navona Notte just off the square is excellent and inexpensive), Piazza Campo dei Fiori, etc. or catch another bus or find your way to the metro. We bought a 4euro all day ticket but, in the end, we probably could have just spent 1euro for a 75 minute ticket (both tickets valid for buses and metro) as we found it preferable to walk. The hotel has a restaurant which provides an a la carte menu or menu of the day for 15 euros. We ate there on our first night and, for the 15 euros, we started with pasta, then had a pork fillet with chips and spinach and a choice of desserts.

If you want to get to Rome without costing a fortune you need to go out of hotel and walk forwards until you reach a road. Turn right at top and walk to end of road. Across the road on left is a bus stop. Get bus 32 to Ottovario Metro link.

Location: yes, it's not next to Colosseum, but a cab from the Spanish Steps back to hotel took less than 10 minutes and cost 12 Euros. That is a fair price, although my companions were subject to a cab scam in downtown Rome (driver not switching on the meter on short distance), unrelated to the hotel. The neighbourhood is nice though, residential area with a small market and shops right on doorsteps of the hotel. Rooms: ours were not only not small but in view of the rate (around 70 Euros per room) a good buy indeed. Bathrooms had obviously received a touchup (new bathtub, sink, toilet and bidet), and the bedroom was absolutely OK. The bedroom in decent shape, although the safe in my room didn't work (batteries gone). There might be other rooms where maintenance might be worse, but on our floor (4th) it was absolutely OK. Only two English language channels on TV though (BBC, CNN, the latter always flimmering). Reception: upon arrival around 8 pm there was only one receptionist on duty (other one obviously out for dinner). He had some problems in answering the hotel's main phone line (the phone never stopped ringing), checking in people, handing out whatever guests of a 300-bedroom hotel were asking for. However, we got our keys after about 5 minutes. Restaurant: overpriced, didn't use, went across the road the first evening (not recommendable, avoid the Grappa, tastes like jet fuel), the second day about five minutes downhill a nice place on Via Flaminia Vecchia with a roof terrace, good food and very pleasant service. Breakfast at hotel? Yes, messy when the tour groups charge the buffet, but you get what you need. Conclusion: I booked the hotel because it's used by tour groups like Cosmos and they normally don't put their groups where management and staff are unreliable.

I only paid \u20ac30/night as I booked my room via hotels.com and used a voucher which got me another 10% off the bargain price. For the amount I paid the room was quite good. The hotel is currently under refurbishment which means that some areas (e.g. breakfast room/restaurant) look very fresh and modern whereas areas are a bit more dated. My room looked like its last refurbishment took place at some point in the early noughties. Nevertheless, everything was clean and the members of the room service did their job very well. As other tripadvisor members pointed out, there are some negative points which need to be mentioned here. The walls really are paper thin. Without earplugs falling asleep is hardly possible. There are tour groups from Spain arrving every night at around midnight by coach. People from Mediterranean countries appear not to pay too much attention to people wishing to sleep in the middle of the night. Another issue is that the hotel does not provide proper blankets in white linen. The only thing to be found when arriving is a seperate bedlinen to cover your body with. As a person not coming from Southern Europe I need a blanket to snuggle up in no matter how warm it is. The hotel staff literally tries to convice you that this is very strange. We had a conversation that took ten minutes before the issue was finally solved which I don't consider to be too nice. I then got something which looked more than a rug for the dog than a proper hotel blanket in linen. Yummy!!! Public transport to Central Rome is good via local buses/underground. The 32 service takes to you the Vatican area in about 15-25 minutes with buses arriving every 5-10 minutes. It's a 2 minute walk to the next bus stop.

My partner and I drove all through Italy and there is parking available behind the hotel which costs about 10 Euros a day (which I thought was cheap considering options available elsewhere). I have to say that there is a restaurant right opposite the hotel which provided one of my favourite meals of our trip. It\u2019s quite a quirky little place (I\u2019m sure I remember wallpaper on the ceiling and carpet on the walls!) but the food and atmosphere is great!

With its much vaunted history, Rome is a must see on anyone\u2019s European itinerary. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the four star hotel that was supposed to be one of the good ones in town. Grand Hotel Fleming advertises itself as a four star hotel located in one of Rome\u2019s exclusive quiet residential areas, Collina Fleming. Arriving at the Hotel at midnight, after a tiring 6 hours drive from Venice, I noticed the first signs of trouble when I couldn\u2019t find even a temporary parking spot to unload our luggage. Opting to unload at the front entrance where it\u2019s obvious temporarily offloading is allowed seemed to get the night manager very upset. Assuming neither I nor my wife spoke any Italian, the manager went off on his reception desk attendant berating him for letting us park there. The attendant tried to explain that that he would check us into our room and then instruct us to move the car but the Manager was having none of it, evidence by his arrogant stare and sinister comments about \u2018Damn Americans\u2019 while we are standing right in front of him. Little did he know we are not even Americans but an Ethiopian couple who spoke Italian. After such a horrifying welcome, we were taken to our room that turned out to be completely different from what\u2019s portrayed on the Hotel\u2019s website. It was one cramped room, even in European standards, on very tight quarters. There was a dresser at the foot of the bed whose accompanying chair needed to be moved every time we wanted to pass by to the bathroom, which was also very small, but at least, it was clean. The lack of ample sound proofing is another identifying feature of this so-called \u2018four star\u2019 hotel as noises could be heard from adjoining rooms. The continental breakfast served in the morning partially made up for the horrible experience the night before. Although it didn\u2019t offer anything special or a good variety to choose from, the breakfast contained some good croissants, cookies, coffee, tea, and some juices. However, the lack of customer service was also very apparent as the Hotel staff made it clear that any guest was a nuisance to them. Realizing that our chances of finding parking are nonexistent, we decided to leave the car where it was parked, on the street, even though I had called the hotel prior to my arrival and was assured a parking spot for my midnight arrival. While hanging around the lobby the next morning, we observed the reception desk staff that replaced the ones who greeted us earlier, similarly mistreating their customers and even making fun of a customer\u2019s Russian heritage in Italian while the customer was standing in front of them. Right after that arrived a young woman who had just checked in earlier to find out her room\u2019s door doesn\u2019t lock. The woman tried to make the point that she is alone and cannot be expected to sleep in a room with unlocked doors. Both the attendant and day manager\u2019s response was to either take it or leave it. Aghast at the continuously disgusting behavior of the Hotel staff, I walked over to the Manager and told him everything I had observed since my arrival in Italian. To my surprise, his reply was an arroagant \u2018what do you want me to do?\u2019. It was at that point that I went back to my room to pack up our luggage and leave this horrible hotel with my wife. We cancelled our second and third night reservations and left immediately without any reimbursement, vowing to never even consider Rome again, let alone such a hotel. The level of customer service provided by the Hotel staff is beyond arrogant, snotty, and downright rude.

The man on reception who dealt with us initially was pleasant enough but his two collegues sat talking to each other whilst a queue of waiting guests was beginning to form behind us. The room was clean but absolutely tiny. There was a dresser at the foot of the bed that you had to move the chair from if you wanted to walk past. The balcony was more of a window box with a horrible industrial view. The bathroom was also very small and the sink leaked. Another point of contention for me was the complete lack of sound proofing. Our room must have been beneath a store room as every night and morning, noise similar to chairs scraping across the floor was heard. Also, one night we recieved a call from reception saying someone had complained about the noise coming from our room. This was perhaps 11pm and we were merely talking and having a laugh. No parties in sight! We told this to reception but half an hour later a hotel worker pounded on our door saying we must stop the noise. Also, the maids came round to clean the room between 8 and 8.45am.. I dont claim to be lazy but I dont feel I should have to be up and out every day at that time when on holiday. However, I do feel I should point out that I experienced no problems that other travellers here seemed to in regard to buses etc. We bought week passes when we arrived at the airport which we invaluable. The number 32 bus is a two minute walk from the hotel and this takes you to the Vatican city. However, we jumped out a few stops before this and took the metro from there. Very easy to get to all tourist places from here. In general, this hotel is barely worthy of two stars and the staff make it very clear that you are a nuisance to them.

They refused to accept responsibility, and told me that 'the taxi driver had told them that we'd been checked into the hotel for three days, and that's why the hotel worker didn't call up to our room'.

The reception staff were extremely helpful in advising us on how to get public transport into town (which is quite a long journey - 10 minutes on the bus, then 10 minutes on the tube), so we managed to buy tickets and make the connection very easily. There is a nice little bar by the lobby, and the breakfast was good (cold meat, cheese, bread, the usual). There is a full mini bar frige in the rooms. Dont be put off attempting the trip into Rome alone, it cost one euro for a bus ticket (one way) and a euro for the train (one way). Buy your tickets before you travel, rememebr bust tickets are valid only for about 70 minutes after you buy them (and must be inserted intot he machine inside the bus to validate them) but you can keep your train ticket on you all day to use for the return journy - one ticket per journey. You can buy bus tickets from the tobacco shop just by the bus stop round the corner from Hotel Fleming, take the bus all the way to the Vatican where it terminates, follow the signs to the metro ('Ottaviano' station) on foot, buy your ticket from the machine inside the station (all in english and very easy), and hop on the train to 'Spagna', and you'll come out right at the spanish steps, easy and all done in 30-40 minutes. The trains run really late into the evening and are easy to use, so long as you dont dawdle getting on and off as the doors shut really quickly. So if you are on this archers/cosmos tour, how about not paying (quite a lot of money) for the optional evening excursions and doing it yourself for just a few euros, instead sit by the Trevi fountain or have a coffee at the Cafe Greco, or stroll about and people watch by the spanish Steps.", "Date": "August 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cClena hotel, Poor location & tips for Cosmos tourists\u201d", "Author": "ArmchairGypsy", "ReviewID": "UR17997973", "Content": "We were here in May on the Splendors of Italy tour by Cosmos.

While this may not be our first choice of hotel by far(we stayed at the Delle Muse before we joined the tour and loved it - pls see our review of that hotel on this site), it wasn't too bad. Yes, the location leaves much to be desired but we did manage to find 2 things that are really useful for Cosmos tour groups like ours. 1. The tiny grocery store that is in the same square as the hotel(walk out and go straight. it is the last store in the square, next to a meat shop) is a great way to save money. We picked up a huge six pack of 1.5 -2 litre bottles of still mineral water(aqua minerale naturale) and some juices and iced tea for 8 euro! When you see tiny 500ml water bottles being peddled for 1 euro at the sights through the rest of your trip to your fellow travellers you will see your savings adding up! We packed the unopened bottles into our half empty suitcases and removed one to drink each day of our trip and filled its space with shopping! 2. A great little bakery/takeaway on a street parallel to the hotel.Exit hotel walk to the left top corner of the square to get to the main road(2 mins walk), turn left and almost immediately you will see another quiet road leading off this main road, parallel to the one leading to the square you came from. Walk 500 m down this road(if you need to walk more than 2-4 mins you are on the wrong road) and to your left you will see a red illuminated sign advertising coffee, pizza etc.(caffe/pizzeria/pastaceria) They make great lasagna, grilled vegetables, pizza, heavier meat/chicken based meals all for takeaway. They pack in cutlery too which is great. We picked up lasagna, pizza and dessert for 6 euro and took it back to the hotel to have with our juices and tea from the grocery store. The hotel menu offers pizza and a drink for 15 euro per person and is not too great so this was well worth it at 1/3 the price for two people. Taxis into town cost 12-15 Euro. Room air conditioning was not on in May and it was starting to get warm outside. So we slept with the door to the balcony open...if the air con isn't on in June it might be quite uncomfortbale, but in May at night it was pleasant. There are better options for independent travellers but for Cosmos group travellers, it is not as bad as people would have you think! Room was clean, and neat, tv had English channels, lifts were normal sized and worked fine, breakfast was basic(ham and cheese with breads and coffee), room size was average (not tiny but not as big as one is used to either).

It was cool in the evenings so we left our windows open and we were fine except for the street noise but again not a big deal as I was very tired both nights.

Also, the residential/retail center around the hotel had it's own character and even a small market that opened on Monday morning right across the street.

I would try to aviod other hotels of the same chain (LE.AN), as they might use this hotel for overflow in busy periods. The rooms are small and tired indeed, and my toilet smelled of stale urine (for the rest it was pretty spotless). Also the doors where like paper so everything which went on outside the room was loud. In this case the other guests near me understood this, and were quiet, but otherwise the stay could have turned into a bad experience. Positive point are the quality of the bed, and perhaps the restaurant (for fast, easy cheap dinner in the neighborhood, I've seen quality of food and better breakfasts). Also the bar was fine, and the staff not unfriendly.", "Date": "December 15, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia", "Title": "\u201cNightmare!!

I don't think they understand English or they just don't care. The first night when our tour group arrived. We were served dinner by very bad mannered waiters. They dumped the pasta on your plate as if you were in a soup kitchen. When I asked for a little more mushroom on my pasta, the waiter yelled something in Italian & of course I got no mushroom. The following morning, during the breakfast time in the hotel, one of the girls in our group got her purse stolen right at the breakfast table. Poor lady ended up spending that day in the police station filing for her lost of her money & plane ticket that were in the purse.

It is a distance from town but there is a shuttle service that is cheap, bus that is near by and taxi cab is not too expensive. The biggest problem with this hotel (aside from the rude staff) is their lack of air conditioning. Apparently they do not believe in cooling off their guests at night. The A/C shuts off in the middle of the night for all the hotel rooms and comes back on mid afternoon. We were there with a tour group and stayed for 2 nights. The first night we woke up at 3am burning up in September and thought the air was broken in our room. We had to sleep with the door open to get a breeze in our room. The next morning we learned everyone on our tour had the same problem and that is when the front desk advised they turn off the A/C at night. What a joke- they waste so much water each time you flush the toilet yet they are too cheap to cool down their guests while they sleep.", "Date": "September 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cBring a fan...\u201d", "Author": "Tagger87", "ReviewID": "UR3640579", "Content": "As other reviewers mention, this hotel has an issue with air conditioning. They don't seem to think we need it! We stayed there for two nights and then returned for a third night as part of a tour. Our first room sweltered. The air conditioner was on full blast and could barely be felt three feet away. Then they cut off all a/c units at 2 am, leaving the room even more unbearable. Our second room was a little better, you could feel the a/c up to about 5 feet away. The staff is very aloof and somewhat rude. You can stand at the desk and they will totally ignore you. You evidently are interupting their busy day. I also worry about security. They only provide one key per room and we were advised by our tour guide to leave the key at the desk whenever we left the hotel, as there would be a large fee if we lost the key. When returning to the hotel, all you had to do was give a room number and the key would be handed over. No ID required, no questions asked. You could ask for any room key and they would have just given it to you.

The information provided in other reviews about the air conditioning were correctly stated, so for those of us who are used to a/c all the time, this was a problem, I woke up several times all sweaty, with no real way to cool off except by splashing off with cool water. I'm sure this would be even worse in mid summer. The walls of this hotel were extremely thin, we could hear every move made in the adjoining rooms, from sliding out of chairs, television, wake up calls, conversation, coughing, and even flushing of toilets. And my hearing is not great! And we had quiet, elderly couples on both sides, instead of young, party people. I'm sure it would be unbearable if that had been the case. Even though the location was far out of town, the bus was accessible (unlike the other hotel I stayed in which was UNREACHABLE by public transportation) The taxi ride for me and two others to this hotel was 67 Euros from the airport. I liked the neighborhood, and had gelato at the corner restaurant for a reasonable price about the same as home. We bought bottled water at the corner store for a reasonable price as well. Overall, the staff was ok, not friendly by US standards, but not rude, just still seemed to be surprised by our expectaions of cool air at any hour of the day. I won't stay here when I return to Rome because of the time and expense wasted getting back and forth to the hotel, and because of the noise levels from other rooms.", "Date": "June 23, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Grand Hotel Fleming", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d284236-Reviews-Grand_Hotel_Fleming-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$55 - $261*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Pza Monteleone Di Spoleto 20</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00191</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "284236", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/ab/72/ab72349658923ec2f00064c186203a555large.jpg"}}
