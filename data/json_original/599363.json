The Las Cortes is really nice. It's in the heart of everything in Madrid, but is a little oasis away from any noise outside. Our first room had the noise inside, unfortunately, but after the first night of listening to what sounded like a train passing through our room every 30 minutes, we asked to be moved and promptly were. Again, great service from the front desk, all of whom were most accommodating and friendly, not even minding our terrible attempts at Spanish. In our second room we settled in quickly to the great facilities and excellent quality of the accommodation. Couldn't fault it, and this time no train noise. Avoid 417!! It's next to the lift, but we worked out by going up and down in it that it wasn't that that was causing the noise. And the front desk had no idea either.

Did not bother with breakfast which is pricey at \u20ac16 per head - plenty of places nearby - \u20ac10 for 2. Bar prices are very reasonable - enjoyed coffee and also a few drinks there on our last night. Do try the restaurant at the lower end of this street - junction of first turn to the right walking down - brillant restaurant - book first. Also enjoyed The Turf in plaza santa anna but avoid the bar on the top right hand side of the square as you walk up from the hotel - rip off! City is amazing place.

I paid E100 and E120 per night. This was my first visit to Spain, and I travelled solo. The hotel is a renovated 18th c. palace and is well decorated and maintained. My twin bed room was located on the 4th floor, on the rear side of the hotel, and was large, as was the marble bathroom. A firm mattress but that didn't stop me sleeping. Double French doors to the Juliet balcony provided great noise-proofing (and a charming view) for the very late-night Madrileno crowd and the \"Occupy\" protest march, and the AC worked well. Didn't eat or drink at the hotel so can't comment there. For a first time visitor, the location is fantastic and I felt safe (although I wasn't wandering about at 1 or 4 am). Less than half a block from Plaza Santa Ana and about 2 1/2 blocks to the Prado Museum and everything in that neighbourhood. Can walk to Antioch rail station as well, which I did to buy tickets; wouldn't necessarily recommend walking on the uneven stone with a rolling suitcase. Things I noted: although the reception staff was helpful, they do not substitute for concierge service in this 4 * hotel, and there are no clocks in the rooms (or any room in Spain I stayed at). Would definitely recommend the Catalonia for a first time visitor and I would consider it for a second visit (although I like to stay in new areas). I stayed at the Catalonia Moratin on C. Antioch on the evening before my early morning flight home. Very friendly and helpful staff (more so than the Las Cortes), large room and bath again not quite as nicely decorated as the Las Cortes, and E75.

Despite having to take two transfers to get here, it is the most efficient, economic way. It costs two euros, and if you are an avid traveler like my husband and I are, and know how to not overpack, carrying your suitcases up the metro stairs is not a big deal. Take the Anton Martin stop and walk up Calle de Leon (which is right off the metro stop) two minutes. Turn left on Calle de Huertas, and an immediate right on to Calle Echegaray. Once you hit the first street, Calle del Prado, you are there! -We stayed in room 108. It was lovely and clean, but being on the first floor, there was a lack of privacy. Also, the bed was quite hard, which was unfortunate. There is also no clock in the room, so either bring one or have your cell phone handy. The windows in the room also don't open.

The hotel is well located for the Plaza Mayor and Retiro Park and Prado.

No noisy neighbours, even though we shared a wall with my daughter who had the TV on, so insulation must be good - and no bath gurgles. Staff were largely very friendly. The lady getting us in and out was courtesy and welcome herself. The young main asked to help find the car rental place already knew where it was (FYI after the luggage check inside Atocha station departures - look very carefully for the signs, which are more visible going W-E across the concourse) and was able to reassure from his own problems finding it. The restaurant was closed when we arrived but the bar staff and a guy dealing with the kitchen were happy to run us up omelette and crisps - at room service rates, but very helpful. Good breakfast buffet. Minor gripes - the wi-fi did not work on the 5th floor. They got the IT guy to reset the router, but when it still didn't work, said \"but he's reset the router!\" rather than think it might need another kick. But it worked fine in the bar. The lady who gave us a city map was off-hand - but that was it. To avoid late-night room service charges, it's worth looking at the Pl. Sa. Ana up the hill - we wished we'd seen the O Chaco galician restaurant first, and the kids' playground outside included a conjuror! For basics, the chinese-run supermarket on c/de Leon, down the hill did the cheapest mineral water we found on our trip, and would do other stuff. We did eat at the Cuban place across from the hotel, ok, good mojitos, but at EUR120 for 3+child, dear.

Apart that the foyer is really very *** , low ceilings and decorated like a Hong Kong handbag and accessory shop, lots of white marble, somewhat tawdry light fittings and brass detailing. However the rooms are quite splendid - spacious, well-furnished, great bathrooms, comfortable beds. To people who trot out the time-worn adage that they \"are only going to sleep in them\", that is quite a lot of the twenty four hours , I wonder how much time they intend spending in the foyer or hotel bar? This is the antithesis of most hotels that offer luxurious public rooms and horrible, little, claustrophobic boxes masquerading as luxury bedrooms. The breakfast, served in an austere subterranean dining room -not a particularly pleasant place - is none-the-less superlative for quality. This is not a copious buffet of everything and anything but a well chosen selection of all the best appropriate produce in the local market. On an occasion when I was too late for the hotel breakfast I went to the Alicia Room Mate next door .The comparison was extreme, their breakfast in the tapas bar adjacent was very poor, and the place had the unpleasant aura of a highway pull-in on the morning after the night before. My wife was attending a dental convention, leaving me pushing the baby and I did not feel much drawn a huge \"deluxe\" convention hotel at least twenty minutes walk along broad and traffic jammed streets to get anywhere I might want to be. The hotel in question describes itself as being \"at the strategic center of Madrid\" ( I guess it all depends on whether you can throw a stone that far, etc. ) Several trip advisors warned that the hotel in question is partially surrounded by a seedy red-light district, 'though one American lady did admit that they were of a better class! Where the Catalonia Las Cortes really excels is on its location and I am not thinking only of major tourist attractions. Much, much more than that, the hotel is on the old town areas of Las Huertas and La Latina which remain firmly in a time warp. Touristic nonsense has not yet forced out the real shops that people need, as in the old centers of most European cities The Marais in Paris is case in point, the Jewish delicatessens and shoe repairers are no more, forced out by multiple branches of l\"Occitane and dubious jewelery shops. Enjoy that whilst it stands, probably not for so long. The general fruit and vegetable market at Anton Martin (easy walking distance) is the perfect antidote to too much of being the sightseer. You can return to the human race having a coffee with the traders at the small bar upstairs. Just up the road from the hotel but far enough away to avoid the night time din is Pz Santa Ana which has a lot of quite reasonable tapas type bars that are friendly, relaxed and informal. Remember the Spaish start very late and throw all their rubbish on the floor ! You can so easily slip back to the hotel to rest before going out to take a glass of wine and a snack. That can easily occupy five or six hours. A bit further and you come to the famous and impressive Pz Mayor which is a commercialised hell-hole . Don't even think of eating there and the same goes for the horrible Puerta del Sol where a lot of younger people hang about to imbibe the traffic fumes. My lasting memory - the view from the balcony into an old barber's shop with brightly coloured bottles of bay rum, macassar, oil of violets,. and, tubs of brilliantine bearing the labels unchanged for near a century. Of course the obligatory rotating, stripey pole, red on white (or is it white on red?) drawing the eye in hypnotically. The barber quite as antiquated as his clientele, and most with little left except for a shave and polish. A morning of hand shaking and back patting before moving on, all bright as new pins, to read the papers in a favourite cafe. To have the same arguments and tell the same jokes.

They were also very accommodating about keeping one of our bags until our return. The suite was wonderful-- enormous bed, two flat-screen TV's, lovely furnishings, and frescoed ceilings. Being on the 2nd floor, on the corner facing the P. del Prado, I was concerned about noise but we heard nothing.. even on the weekend. We really appreciated the thoughtful design of the room-- ample closets, electric sockets at the height of the desk, good lighting (with switches actually next to them!!!), extra pillows and blankets, and a shower curtain in addition to the usual \"half- enclosure\" of the bathtub that leaves the floor flooded when you shower. Free wireless is available in all the rooms, and it actually works-- really well and with no hassles. The housekeeping eveywhere in the hotel is immaculate, and we didn't experience any of the discinfectant smell noted by other reviewers.

The highlights of this hotel are the very, very spacious rooms, which in my experience are quite unusual, even at higher-priced hotels in Madrid. When you're here working, the airy, high-ceiling look and the space to move around is so welcome that I'll make this my first choice when I return. As someone else mentioned, the beds are quite hard, but the pillows are soft. There's an excellent selection of newspapers in the lobby --all the Spanish papers, plus the Herald Tribune, the Financial Times and even Le Monde. But the place is quirky.

The hotel is very short distance from the train station and it's a 15 minutes walk. However, if you have luggages, highly suggest you take the cab BUT have the hotel arrange it for you. We got out of the station and took a cab in a nearby stand and when we told the cab driver where we were going, he started mumbling and looked sort of pissed off . Since the hotel is not located on one of the main street, it was hard to park and he almost kicked us out of the cab demanding the fare on the meter PLUS surcharge saying something like \"too short of a trip and need to charge us more\". He never got out of the car to help us with our luggage and we took our time but he started to swear (we knew since it's usually the first thing you learn in a foreign language) at us. Being we are New Yorkers, we could easily fight back without much fear, however, we let it go since we ARE in a foreign country. We decided to hold our tongue and told him to stop swearing. We told the concierge and she told us they could easily arrange a cab for us with more friendlier driver which they did for our trip to the airport. The hotel room is very spacious and clean with very comfortable bed. The breakfast is really the highlight of our days since it has a huge selection with great coffee to go with it. Just make sure you check the time since it's different between weekdays and weekends. The hotel is walking distance to a lot of places but you can take the Metro to a lot of places and it's very convenient. Madrid is really a city much like any other big city and has a huge nightlife. It's just so happened that we were there during the weekend of Blanco Noche when many of the museums in the city are opened 24 hours with free admissions and there were street performances until well into night. The local food scene is definitely one of the best in the world with many selections to chose from. We also took day trips outside of Madrid to Toledo, Saville and El Escorial which we thought were more charming than Madrid. Overall, the experience at Madrid was okay since it was just too much of a metropolis for us and missing the charm we were looking for.", "Date": "July 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cLocation and personal service\u201d", "Author": "sti5brigade", "ReviewID": "UR16833756", "Content": "Hotel my company was going to book was full so I chose this hotel based on location and value Its got an excellent location, close to a nice square, with live music and good restuarants (it is about 100 metres from the square, but far enough to not have any noise issues) Excellent service from the guy on reception and the waitress, who patiently listened to any request I had Dont get me wrong, this is not a five star hotel.

It can not be a 4 star because if you walk down the hill to the Westin Palace that is a 5 star just one better and thus this is not a 4. It is a good three star and if you get the price of a 3 you have a great find. The issues are the total package. There is no lobby. The restaurant is an after thought in a town known for great food. A $20+ breakfast is basically a standard bacon sausage and amenitites buffet kept warm too long. The diunners are basic. The room choices vary from the magnificent 202 to a literal dungeon 03. I am not kidding a dungeon is a room with no real windows and it is dark all the time and it at the lowest point in the hotel thus room 03. So the ability to predict a great experience is based on what is available. If you are flying here from the USA you had better insist on a certain type of room as all of the good ones are gone by 1800. What makes it a great 3 star is the cleanliness, the location, walk to the Thyssen, the Prado the Archeologie Museos, the Botanical Gardens or the park. A quick tube stop to almost anywhere else. The bathrooms are all in marble and the floors are wood which is nice unless the person above you walks around in heals which then drives you crazy. The people are nice and helpful and the internet is free. So it is a great 3 star. There are no amenities other than the internet, so if you need a place to sleep and get a good rate and a nice choice of rooms you will feel like you are in heaven. If anyone of those does not happen you will feel sort of put off and if two do not happen you will wonder who those people are that wrote those glowing reviews.

Everything we wanted to see/do was within 2-3 metro stops, so very convenient. If you're looking for cutting edge decor the Room Mate Alicia might be for you - we walked by it on several occasions as it is close by Las Cortes and the lobby features some interesting \"art\"!

We found it a little difficult to find at first seeing as it about a 10 min walk from Sol Metro and you have to take quite a few turns to find it. The reception area is probably the least impressive thing about hotel. It's perfectly fine and functional and I would have no complaints about it. But for such a wonderful hotel the reception area does not do it justice seeing as it is just average. I would not count this as a fault though. Our check in was perfect. The staff throughout our stay were very friendly and helpful. The room itself was beautiful. A nice mix of old and new. The building is a converted palace evidently. Some of the rooms (not ours) have the original painted ceilings. The bed was big and comfortable and the bathroom was spotless, classy and had a lovely powerful shower. The air-con (unlike many other hotels I've stayed in in Spain) actually worked perfectly and made sleeping very comfortable at night. The location of the hotel is only a few steps from Plaza St. Anna which is the main square for eating out and is surrounded by restaurants, bars and cafes where you can get some amazing food for good prices. All in all a lovely stay at Catalonia Las Cortes. No complaints at all. Rooms are lovely and quiet too.

I booked this hotel after failing to secure a reservation for the Gran Canarias, and we were not disappointed. I had researched the Las Cortes on trip advisor and found the reports to be very accurate. The trip from the airport took about 20-30 minutes depending on the taxi driver. It would appear that they all model themselves on Schummacher! Don't sit in the front seat if you are of a nervous disposition. The meter was running, but at the end of the trip this was \"adjusted\". For 3 or 4 in a cab it seems that the going rate is \u20ac30, which is not too bad considering the entertainment en route! On arrival at the hotel, check-in was relatively painless once the two young men on reception worked out the room permutations. We booked the standard rooms, of which there were slight variations. Ask for a room overlooking the courtyard as they are slightly bigger and probably quieter. The rooms are on the small side compared to some other European cities but have very comfy beds, nice marble bathrooms, all the usual toiletries and a good hairdryer (you did need a strong thumb though!).Breakfast was included which was good with a selection of cooked, healthy i.e fresh fruits, juices and muesli and also cold meats, cheeses and even chocolate cake! The hotel is in an ideal location for most of the main tourist attractions, i.e. Palacio Real, Plaza Major, Puerta Del Sol, Prado (closed Mondays, free entry Sundays but large queue) Thyssen, El Rastro & Retiro Park. All were within easy walking distance. The Plaza St Ana is a 2 minute stroll up the street and is a great place to spend time over a jug of sangria or tapas in the evening. It does get very busy Fri/Sat with tables at a premium, so going out early i.e. before 10 pm is a good idea. We ate just off the square at La Fragua De Vulcano. Good raciones (large tapas) but the music is a bit on the loud side. Vinoteca Bibicheria in Pl. St. Ana is a good tapas bar/restaurant but as you can't book, finding a table at the weekend is hard. Think the favourite place had to be El Buschon 5 minutes north east of Pl.St. Ana. Excellent pork and meatballs. Everything is in Spanish but half the fun is decifering the menu & guesswork! It was all good. We enjoyed Madrid very much with the location and standard of the hotel adding to this greatly.

The hotel has an intimate, cozy ambience with a small lobby and bar area. The staff working at the front desk were very friendly and helpful. After traveling in the south of Spain, we were happy to return once again to this hotel which felt like home in Madrid. Our rooms were definitely the largest we have occupied in Europe or Asia. On our last night there, my husband and I were upgraded to a junior suite with the largest bed I've ever seen--much larger than a king. The bathrooms were marble and had both a walk-in shower with excellent water pressure and a bathtub with shower. Each room also had beautiful tray ceilings, although minus the murals shown in the hotel photos. The hotel has maintained the large, beautiful staircase which was a part of the original structure. We only ate at the restaurant for breakfast. An excellent buffet selection of fruit, eggs, meat, and pastries was offered. Internet was available in the lobby next to the bar for a fee. The front desk staff was exceptionally helpful in dealing with problems we had with a booking in Seville. Yazid and Vanessa were uncomplaining in their efforts to assist us and always cheerful. Danny was also exceptionally pleasant. All three spoke excellent English. I would absolutely recommend this hotel to future travelers.

If you don't want to stay in a hi tech hotel (of which there are many in Madrid) and prefer a bit of old Spain - stay here.! The rooms are very comfortable with a beautifully done separate bathroom. Ours had a walk in shower room- very luxurious for a 4 star and air conditioning- which we did need in Feb as hotel was a bit too hot for us. This hotel is surrounded by great little bars and resturants- stay off Santa Ana for value and is walking distance to all the other major points of interest.(musems, Sol,La Latina, Plaza Mayor,Palacio Real, Gran Via)). We didn't get the metro once. Madrid is fabulous and I hope to return when the weather is warmer. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who likes a bit of style and comfort. The value was brillant- room B&B per night was 99euro- a bargain. I've don't have any photos but I would say that the hotel web site photos do not do this Hotel justice. Also this is a safer area than say- Sol and the Gran Via-where I saw an attempt at pic-pocketing etc at night time. Be careful where you stay in this city.
