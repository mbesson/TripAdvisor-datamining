The bathroom was small and not worth the extra charge. What we did like was the location. We could walk everywhere: 1313 Main for wine/cheese, Opera House, dining, etc. The first night at 2am there was a drunken fight in the room next door..we were moved to a room down the hall. This room was so much nicer, brighter, cleaner, bigger bathroom. The staff never apologized for the inconvenience I made 2 trips to office..first to complain then to get a new room.

Not sure if they are all the same, but this one was like a compound, the rooms surrounded the parking lot, which was inadequate for the amount of rooms. Booked this room several weeks ago. The usual places we stay at were not available, so we chose the Travelodge due to the positive reviews. I will begin by saying, the room itself was nicely done. Modern, with crown molding, overall the rooms visual effect was pleasing...... It was adequately clean, the ceiling above the shower needed some de-molding, and some loose change was left on top the air conditioning unit. The towels were bright white and fresh, but could have been a bit larger and plusher. There was little water pressure in the shower and we were on the ground floor. The toilet fill valve needs replacing as the tank fills at a snails pace. As for the bed, the mattress was very comfortable, however the pillows were thin and hard.The mattress sheet was flat and too small to be tucked under the mattress, and the blanket options were limited as there was either a top sheet, or an extremely thick top comforter of synthetic material. Coffee maker, coffee and hair dryer, shampoo and soap were provided. .......My complaint about this Travelodge was the location of the room we were given. Room 117. It is located in front of the postage sized pool entrance gate, and 2 handicapped parking spaces that continually were being used by other guests to unload luggage, before finding parking on the street. This room was located at a juncture where every hotel guest passed in front of to reach their room. This is also where every smoker stood and smoked their cigarettes, it wasn't necessary to open the door to smell the smoke, because a 1/2 inch gap separated the door from the floor.

The location was fabulous for walking to restaurants and shops. Large grocery within a mile drive. Wonderful small town atmosphere - not stuffy like some of the winery areas. The manager was very welcoming, friendly and helpful. Also the visitor's center is within walking distance and extremely informative. If you are looking for a safe, clean, reasonably priced hotel within walking distance of small quaint dining places, you won't be disappointed. Also recommend Downtown Joe's for dining and drinks and Napa Valley Roasting Co. for morning coffee and danish. The drive to the Napa wineries was about 10-15 minutes away. Also would like to suggest V. Sattui as a must stop on the winery tour. Nothing else compares for a combo of beautiful gardens, friendly staff, and food and drinks. Very, very few other wineries in Sonoma and Napa are grandfathered in as the only wineries where you can actually purchase food (cheese, crackers, etc.) The other 2 we know of are Benziger and Domaine Carneros in Sonoma but they don't come close in the food dept. (We weren't expecting that). Also you can actually purchase a bottle at V. Sattui and some wonderful cheeses and consume it on their grounds. The majority of the other wineries you can only taste and they are not allowed to sell you even as much as a glass so that was rather disappointing.", "Date": "July 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City", "Title": "\u201cstay away!!!\u201d", "Author": "travelingal32", "ReviewID": "UR17215143", "Content": "This is about the Downtown Napa Travelodge, located in Napa, California on Coombs Street.

However, when we got there, it didn't look too bad. The exterior looked like it had just been painted and it was in the middle of downtown napa! The parking area didn't look too full but it was the day before Thanksgiving so I don't think there were too many people staying there. The guy at the front desk was really pleasant and he gave us a map of the area and said if we need anything to call down. I went into the room and immediately had my friend help me lift up the mattress (I told you I read the reviews before and I was scared the place was infested with bedbugs). But the mattresses looked fairly new and no bugs! the room/bed is definitely only built for two though, so if you are planning on trying to squeeze four people into the room, good luck. Two of you will need to sleep on the floor next to the bathroom/sink/closet space/desk area by the door. The bathrooms looked pretty clean and my only complaint were the towels were a little worn and some of them didn't look like they had been washed very thoroughly (one of the washcloths looked like it still had a lipstick on it and one of the bath towels had a brown mysterious stain) I only noticed it in the morning after i had thankfully used a clean towel but I'm sure if I called down, they would have bought me some new ones. The location is the best though! I mean, all the restaurants i had read up on were in walking distance, (check out cole's chop house and uva trattoria) and it was next to the little downtown center with a cool little indie bookstore. If you're looking to hang out at the motel/hotel all day, hang out by the pool (it was tiny and i didn't even look at it very closely) and watch tv (worked at night but in the AM didn't work at all, strange) and relax, this is not the place to go but if you just need a central place to store your bags and sleep, it's not bad. I mean, i have seen worse. I think it might just be a combination of it being a little older and just the number of people who probably pass through all the time. Oh! and if you're one of those people who worry about security, they have two entrances (that i could see) one was the elevator and the other were stairs but both needed a key card to access the top floors. (it kinda made up for the fact that our door didn't have one of those super locks on it, it looked broken off) so overall, it was a pretty clean, very centrally located, easy to find, parking was good (but again maybe because of the holiday), somewhat secure, maybe a little rundown/worn but a passable place to stay for one night or two nights. if i went onto priceline and found out I had to stay there again, i wouldn't be so worried.

My first stay was back in 2001 before the place was remodeled and still called a motel. At that time it was a walk-in rate of 55.00 a night with a King bed, very basic, but in reasonable condition. The Travelodge is in a wonderful downtown location with all the great restaurants, COPIA and the wineries conveniently located nearby. The Mustard Festival at the Copia on that particular weekend was my primary reason for booking this Travelodge. For this stay, I booked on-line 2 months in advance (January) with some assistance from the Travelodge front desk. I needed two rooms, one with a king and the other with a queen for a friend traveling with us. The reservations online showed only queen beds but I knew otherwise from my past visit. I called the Travelodge directly after making the reservation and was assured by the front desk person that they could make adjustments in-house to the reservations and not to worry. They (local Napa Travelodge) had problems with the on-line reservations not showing accurate information about the actual rooms that were available at that site. Two weeks before our stay, I checked to make sure the reservations were valid and had the correct rooms listed. Everything looked ok. On March 17th, We checked in. On the reservation were two queen beds. There was no reference made for a king bed. My husband is 6' 5\". A king bed at a hotel is a necessity, not a luxury in his case. My friend's room was fine for her needs. I was livid that all the planning that I arranged was in vain. A complete deception. I demanded to speak with the manager. He acted like I was crazy because no such arrangement existed on the computer, in his world. I was also told that no other rooms were available, the hotel was completely booked. I knew we would be billed for the rooms whether we took them or not. I demanded that we be given a king room at the rate I was given. I was told that none was available. Finally, the desk clerk relented and offered us a King suite. The rate was 149.00 a night, not the 109.00 rate agreed on the phone with the the desk clerks previously. I consented and took it. At this point, there was no other choice. I was still going to be charged for the rooms whether I took them or not. Given the fact that it was St. Patrick's Day weekend in sunny Northern California, it seemed to be the only option other than driving back home. The so called \"suite\" (#307) had maintenance problems. The bathroom door was stuck to the point that it was difficult to open or close due to a sloppily fitted door jamb. A torn, slightly mildewed, shower curtain with ill-fitting and missing shower rings served as the barrier between shower and floor. This curtain looked like it was ready to be used as a painting dropcloth, it was in such poor condition. Water leaked through the curtain due to a centrally placed hole. The curtain kept falling down due to the limited no. of rings (5 rings- 12 holes), spraying additional water. The hot/cold tub faucet was mislabeled. The water pressure was low and the shower head was difficult to adjust. The fan didn't work, however, it looked like the light on the fan worked but the fan was never connected. The sink was remodeled recently and tiled in granite. The granite was sealed incorrectly and had stains. The coffee maker was broken. Cheap styrofoam cups were in the room, just like a Motel 6. The towels provided were worn out and stained. The room interior had worn, dirty carpets and signs of dry rot around the bay window. When the right side of the bay window was opened, the panel fell off. My friends room (#209) had stains on the furniture and the towels in her room were in similar condition. All this for 149.00 and 99.00 a night. If you are planning to visit Napa, please AVOID this hotel. It's so tempting due to the ideal location. For 149.00 a night, check out the Silverado or the Hilton Garden Inn. These places are not downtown, but you won't get swindled like I did. Chablis Inn has a king suite for 99.00 a night, another great option. You can do better.
