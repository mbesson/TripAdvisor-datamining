After a good stay in Feb. of this year, we decided to return to the Pension Kleist in Nov. The prices were very reasonable in Feb. and we were offered the same price this time (something they offer returning guests). Our first visit, we found the place to be clean, comfortable, quiet and with a decent breakfast buffet in the morning (included in the price). The location is excellent, a few streets from the Kurfuerstendamm, great cafes in the neighborhood (just bordering Charlottenburg) and near the S-Bahn  U-Bahn.When we booked directly with the hotel this time, we were not warned that the whole building is undergoing major construction. Instead, when we arrived bleary eyed after a long flight from the US, we were greeted with scaffolding covering the whole building. The owner had upgraded us into the best room, but failed to tell us why she did this. We assumed it was a special offered to returning guests. We asked about the construction, but she said not to worry, they don't begin until 9:00am, they wouldn't be working Sat. thru Mon., and they were working in the courtyard side of the building. Our room faced the front of the building.At 7:20am every morning, we were awoken with the arrival of the construction crew banging, talking, tools and equipment rattling. Yes, they did work mostly in the courtyard, but we still could not escape the arrival noise and they moved in and out of the building quite loudly. We also found them just outside our window talking, one morning, on the scaffolding. Not fun, especially when the windows are covered with very sheer curtains. They did not work Sat.  Sun., but they were back at 7:20am (this is punctual Germany, after all) Monday morning.Towards the end of our trip, I was not feeling well and tried to sleep in until noon. That was the day of renovations within the Pension and the noise in the room next to us was intolerable.If we had been told, at the time of reserving the room, that this outside construction and interior renovation of the pension rooms would be happening, we would have never booked it. Yes, we did have the option to leave upon arrival, but the owner made it seem like it wouldn't be a problem for us and we were too tired and drained to have to begin a new search (with our luggage) for alternative lodgings.During our stay in Feb., we paid for our stay with a credit card. The 2nd to last night of our stay in Nov., we were informed that credit cards were no longer accepted and we would have to pay by cash. We spent a good portion of our last day, scurrying around to get all of the cash together. The owner also would not give us a discount, stating she had upgraded us to her best room as compensation for the construction noise. This was news to us!I can only say, proceed with caution if you are considering this place. Inquire if construction is still going on (if you are staying over a weekend, it shouldn't be a problem) and definitely confirm the payment policies before you book. We will not be returning to this property in the future due to the lack of communication and the way we were treated, especially being returning guests.", "Date": "Dec 6, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR632100496", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "wolfieamadeus"}, {"Content": "Zu empfehlen !!!   showReview(14681054, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR821100534", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "krollinger"}, {"Content": "Tolle Lage.
