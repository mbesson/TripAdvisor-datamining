I've been to Amsterdam several times. In fact, I've stayed at the Hotel Titus before. You can get the number 5 (and 1 I think) from Centraal Station to the Leidseplien which will be a 2min walk from the hotel. Being familiar with it all, we walked and it will take about 40mins from station to hotel. We got a shared twin room and it worked out something like \u00c2\u00a3110 for two nights between two of us - so just over \u00c2\u00a325 per person per night. The location is great - just down the road from the Leidseplein and in walking distance for the shops, pubs, coffee shops, museums etc. If you couple a great location and a great price - something has to give, and it's the 'quality' of the room here that suffers - not in an overly bad way, but in terms of 'you get what you pay for'. Our room had a shower, a basin, we had clean towels, and a free of charge to use safe. We had a large window and a small TV. The room was large enough for the two beds and that's about it. The water was always hot, but unfortunately the downside means the room could get quite warm - not an issue due to the big window. The toilet was right outside, but shared, and small. The location was at the very top of the building and the stair climb was epic - not for the elderly, infirm, or drunk! If you only want a place to crash and will rarely be in the room other than to sleep, and you're happy with climbing steps - then this should be great! If you want somewhere that you can chill for an hour or two here and there, you may find it a bit uncomfortable as a relax-zone. If you're going with friends - make sure they're good friends as privacy in a room like that is non existent! There's also a free breakfast which like the hotel, is basic, but not exceptional - but gets the job done! :o) Happy Travelling!", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reykjavik, Iceland", "Title": "\u201cGreat value\u201d", "Author": "Kolla_is", "ReviewID": "UR125148671", "Content": "It is narrow!

The location of Titus is perfect, you can walk anywhere in the down town area, many museums and sights are really close and the airport bus stop is just 5 minutes away. Of course, the hotel is a bit shabby and a little run down but as we only were there for 4 nights and just wanted a relaxed weekend trip to explore a city it was just about perfect.

The location is ideal very close to the busling Leidseplein and only 5 minutes by tram or 25 minutes walk to the Dam Sqaure area and main shopping/bar areas. This is definitly a budget Hotel and 55 euros per night for a weekend stay with breakfast in my view is good value. When we booked we read some damming reviews on Trip Advisor but what do you expect for 55 euros per night. My party was plesently surprised, we had a room for three and a room for four. Yes the rooms are sparsely furnished but were en suite with sattelite television with a wide choice of english channels. Yes the toilets smelt musty but so did my travelling companions at times. The single beds were adequate and the towels clean. Our party are all shapes and sizes and there were no complaints re the beds although perhaps they were too tired or drunk to notice. Cleaning was non exsistant during our weekend stay. The building and rooms are tired but so what. The room for three was on the fourth floor and residents had to climb four sets of stairs so steep that mountaineering skills would certainly have been an advantage. In fact all access to the upper floors was extremely steep and not for the less able or those with heavy rucksacks as the power of gravity may cause you to fall backward.

The ONE positive thing about Titus is that it is in a good location \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just on the fringe of the Leidseplein and in walking distance of most attractions, with good canal and tram links to further destinations close by. However, other than its location, Titus has no other saving graces whatsoever. I travel to Amsterdam regularly, and this particular trip was a late-booked, 2 night stay on a Friday and Saturday night. As such, I just booked the absolute cheapest accommodation available (many hotels do not allow 2 night stays, especially on Fri/Sat, so choices were limited), but the Titus was not even particularly cheap! At approximately \u00c2\u00a380 per night (off-season) for appalling accommodation, Titus has got a good little money-making racket going on! Upon check-in, we had to pay a (refundable) deposit for our pillows. I mean, really? These weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t EXTRA pillows, but the very pillows (one each) that we had to sleep on. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m used to paying deposits for TV remotes and such, but have never laid out 5Eur for a lumpy sack described as a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpillow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Access to upstairs rooms is via extremely steep stairs, which even by Amsterdam standards were neck-breakingly steep. The stairway is dark, dingy, smelly, and doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel especially safe, what with the holes in the wall and all\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The room itself (in our case a twin room) was pitiful. 2 x single beds more suited to toddlers than grown adults, with extremely hard bases, hard pillows, and prison-style, scratchy blankets for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccomfort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. There was a broken mirror and sink, and the window faced a brick wall. Whilst the room had its own shower cubicle (clean-ish, spacious, OK), the toilet was situated on the hallway, to be shared with the rest of the floor. Fortunately, the toilet was situated right next to our room, so using it was no major inconvenience. Unfortunately, it was too filthy for words, stank to high heaven, and was situated in a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcroom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (cupboard) in which it was extremely difficult to close the door whilst going about your business. Sitting on the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthrone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, my knees touched the back of the door, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a 5\u00e2\u20ac\u21222\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd female! The size of the toilet was only a minor issue, though, the real problem was the aforementioned smell and dirt (think abundant poo-stains in the toilet bowl ALL of the time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it had clearly been a long, long time since it was cleaned). The room rate included breakfast which was\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6OK. I will not complain too much about breakfast, because it was an added bonus (it was the same price for room only, so our B&B rate made breakfast essentially free). The coffee and juice were nice, but the breakfast was a poor variation on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccontinental\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6the usual stuff, a slice of ham, cheese, a bit of bread and a hard-boiled egg. Aside from the eggs being grey in colour (clearly not very fresh), it was edible and no ill effects ensued. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d recommend this hotel to budget travellers only, perhaps a group of friends who just literally want a bed for the night and are none too fussed about hygiene and safety. If this room had been CHEAP, my review would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been glowing. Problem is, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more expensive than some much better hotels!

Far, far away from the seedy red light district and the thieves that inhabit the region. For fans of coffee shops, it is a five minute walk to the best coffee shop in town, Easy Times, which has the highest quality product.

Overall, 50 euro a night for a double room with high quality breakfast is one of the best deals you will find anywhere.

The breakfast consisted of a basket of bread and eggs with cheese and salami. The meat and cheese was curling at the edges so obviously wasn't very fresh. The staff were friendly with the exception of one on our last night. Because we were leaving early in the morning we wanted to check out the night before as reception didn't open til 7. Anyway the woman in question tutted as us when we asked to checkout as she was more interested in playing on the computer in the lounge area. She was very abrupt with us and barely spoke. We wouldn't stay at the Titus again as it was a nightmare 5 nights. Maybe it would be OK if you were a teenager who wanted to non-stop party but if you want to sleep at night then don't go to the Titus.", "Date": "May 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "East London", "Title": "\u201cGet what you pay for with this hotel\u201d", "Author": "Webber25", "ReviewID": "UR26674659", "Content": "I have just got back from staying at the Titus Hotel, went with a large group and stayed in the quad rooms - for the price you pay you cant ask for much more, rooms were clean and tidy, there were sockets for hairdryers/straighteners - which believe it or not some cheap hotels dont provide and there is no curfew - which again some other hotels do have curfews Really close the Leidseplein Sq - literally 2mins walk and close to Trams that take you into Dam Central - yes the stairs are narrow, was on the 3rd floor so you do have to be careful - especially after a few!! but that is not a negative as most hotels in the area have the same layout.
