The carpet had stains on it, the bathroom was very small,and the smell was just overbearing. I ended up going to the nearest Rite Aid to buy a can of Febreeze and two Glade Candles just to try and make the room smell some what better!!! The 2nd day of our stay we noticed that even with all the air freshner and the candles lite while we were there, we couldnt get the stench out of the room, so we decided to investigate the room. We found an OLD MCDONALDS bag full of food under the bed, and molded pieces of captain crunch cereal. I was just so disgusted that I didnt even want to be in the room anymore. I stayed majority of the time trying to freshen up the room for the night.The kicker that really turned me off of this place was when House Keeping came into our room and said to me\" Oh wow the room smells good, what did you do to make the room smell better!!!!\" The room really affected our stay there and took away from some of the bonuses The Oceanic brings. I really liked the location and being so close to the beach, Jetski's, and boardwalk. I was glad to have a pool nearby incase we didnt want to be at the beach for hours at a time.

I went against my best judgement and booked the hotel through travelocity. Let me say, it may vary by room type, because the pictures of the family rooms look nice, but we got a Ocean View Queen room. It WAS DISGUSTING! We were there a total of 3 hours and decided to leave. Our daughter got sick from the mold and paint chips in the room. First off, it took like 30 minutes just to get us in our room, even though it was well after 3pm....which is checkin and the reason? They hadnt cleaned it since the last person checked out. Also noticed the 'fresh fruit' that they served for breakfast was sitting out, in no air conditioning with bugs all over it...not appealing at all. When we got to the room and opened the door I about died. Dirty and ripped up comforter.....room so small we had to turn sideways to walk through to the even smaller bathroom. The TV was on...so the cleaning person was watching some soaps while they were \"cleaning\". Found their sponge left in the bathroom, which was completely CLEAN! There was a rusty shelf below the sink that was barely holding with one screw in it. The shower curtain rod? PVC !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! How trailor trash??? There was visible mold all over the bathroom and in corners of the bedroom. You could smell it as well. Paint was chipping all along the edges of the room. And when I took a quick shower the word \"Boo\" was on the mirror. So did they clean? Hm. I don't think so. Just overall craphole. And good luck getting a refund if you booked it through a travel agent. The \"manager\" on duty, whose name is on the wall in the office who checked us in, lied and said she wasn't a manager to the travel agent. She said she didn't know when the manager would be in, and this went on for a week and a half. They finally got ahold of the manager and they are now giving us a refund for the two nights we didn't stay.", "Date": "September 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hyde Park, New York", "Title": "\u201cOMG I should have gone with my gut instinct\u201d", "Author": "tib3322", "ReviewID": "UR117109177", "Content": "We stayed here 8/17 - 8/21. Let me just say that if we could have afforded to blow our budget, we would have checked out moments after checking in. however, it seemed that every other reasonable place that we called was booked, and we didn't want to spend all of our money to get an expensive room, so we were stuck. let me say that as soon as we opened the door to room #55, i felt the tears in my eyes. one of the walls was dirty and had a hole, and the cheap wallboard was bowed. the carpet was quite worn and didn't look clean. i wouldn't even think about hanging anything in the nasty closet, and i didn't take a thing out of my suitcase - i didn't want to put my good things in the dresser. i stepped foot in the bathroom and that's when things got worse. the sink was falling off of the wall. the shower stall - well let's just say i ran out to cvs to buy flip flops. the floor of the stall was dirty - it was much darker than the rest of the stall. the floor was worn and cracking. i could go on and on here. when we closed the door, my boyfriend said \"wow, look, there's a fly swatter.\" I never got that with a room before!!! Amazingly, we didn't have to use it. Still... The next morning in the shower I noticed a sagging tile. At that point it didnt surprise me and I didn't think much of it until later, when my boyfriend was in the shower. I heard him say \"what the heck, am i chicken little?\" the tile broke and fell on his head. we placed the chunk of tile on the bathroom sink. it was still sitting there 2 days later. gee, they did come and put a new tile up. My mood wasn't right the whole time of the vacation because of the room. After talking to other guests and to people in town, my boyfriend went to the front desk and spoke with the manager. Long story short, my card was refunded in full for 3 of the 4 nights that we stayed. That did improve my opinion of the hotel, but, I still wouldn't recommend it to anybody. It's a shame, because it does have a great location at the end of the boardwalk, where most of the fun stuff is. Plus, the pool was actually very nice. You can rent jet skis right next door. Another con was the parking. It is pretty limited, and people using the fishing pier can park in the hotel lot. So, don't count on being able to get a spot if you head out. We came back one night and everything was filled up. The girl at the desk gave us the okay to park in a no parking zone by the pool. At that point, i think they were catering to us. I was really sad with this hotel experience. i do a lot of research before choosing a hotel, and this was no exception. I read the reviews on here and on other sites. While I did see that there were bad reviews for the Oceanic, I saw that they were all pretty much older reviews. I figured okay, they must have improved things, great. NOT THE CASE FROM WHAT I SAW!!!! A coworker of mine spent time at the same hotel last month. She said it was clean and it was fine. After i made my reservation, i got second thoughts, but after hearing her opinion, I stuck with it. Mistake!!!! I should have trusted my gut and cancelled things right away. I won't complain about the size or the dated decor of the place. I could care less how big or small the room is, or if the furniture is pretty. I just want a clean room, where I can get a good night of sleep, and a nice shower. From previous experience, I know not to expect Hilton-type quality in a shore hotel.

The carpets only get vaccummed by hand pushed ancient old vaccummes. They offered to steam clean the carpet but I imagine they don't have a good steam cleaner and was not interested in smelling wet funk for days. I looked into other rooms they are small have ancient furnishings, half the lights don't work. One guest said they vaccummed their own carpet. If they had a bit of sense they would tile the floors, for what I paid for 4 days they could have tiled the \"East Wing\" which used to be 2 rooms with a shared bathroom. Did I mention the mold?? I also found electrical problems in the room. I would reccommend this place to someone I realy hated. NO internet either and their TV's sucked.

If you're over 300 pounds, you may have trouble squeezing past the tiny sink to get into the tiny shower. The walls were thin - I did hear another t.v. when I woke up but it wasn't loud. I don't think it is a loud/party type of place--I pretty much just saw families. There are even several picnic tables outside that overlook the inlet, plus the several tables on the patio outside of my room. There was also a nice clean pool with lots of chairs around it.
