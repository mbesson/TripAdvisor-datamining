I don't like giving bad reviews about hotels, but in this case I feel I must. I paid \u00a3150 for 3 nights, not a lot of money to stay in a London hotel, some people might say. It's a lot of money to me and while I didn't expect the Ritz, I didn't expect to stay in a room with paper either hanging off the walls or scraped off part of the walls. In my opinion, if the owner couldn't be bothered to make the room presentable, then he/she didn't care about the guests who stayed there. There was no lampshade on the ceiling light, there were two plug sockets, but you had to get down on your hands and knees and stretch under a unit, if you wanted to plug in your hair dryer. There was no wardrobe to put your clothes in, there wasn't even a chair that you could use to hang your trousers over. There was 2 coat hangers and 5 hooks on the wall. There were holes in the tiles in the toilet, that had been plugged in with bits of paper. The television had 4 channels, but all the pictures were shadowy. Some might say you don't go to London to watch the television, well I am a 65yr old pensioner and I don't stay out late in the evenings. Because there was a television in the room, I should have been able to tune in to at least the 5 terrestial channels. I could only tune in to 4 channels and all 4 had poor reception. If the owner couldn't provide a watchable television, then he/she shouldn't have put a television in the room at all. Outside my room, there was a plug hanging off the wall. I prayed no toddler would see the plug and put their hands in the holes I went down to breakfast the first morning and was greeted with tea/coffee? No good morning, no smile. Then 2 rounds of toast were plonked on to my table and the waitress flounced off. The next morning, I had breakfast elsewhere and this morning, which was the morning I checked out, I just had two pieces of toast a cup of tea. I only had the toast, because I had to take tablets with food. I understand people have bad days, but when you are dealing with the public, in a service industry, you should deal with them with a smile on your face and in a polite manner. I have to say the room and bedlinen was clean, and the receptionists I met were polite. The hotel is also in a great location. I will not stay in this hotel again, I have stayed in plenty budget hotels, but this is the worst one I have ever stayed in.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent place to stay\u201d", "Author": "Sarah K", "ReviewID": "UR124765957", "Content": "We stayed here for one night in a triple room - the room was extremely clean and tidy on arrival and had all the amenities we needed - TV, shower and toilet.

But of course I am generous and also I am taking part responsibility for not taking heed of the other (i now know helpful) reviews on this website. If this existed in a country with higher overall standards, it would definitely not rank as 2*. In a nutshell: Horrible canteen like 'dining room' for breakfast. Breakfast itself looked worse than anything i would serve to prisoners on death row. (And i'm a conservative!) Single rooms are in the basement and look like cellars. I'm sure not long ago they stored logs in here. No wardrobe, no desk, no carpet, no rug, no toothbrush, no toiletries and the cup they gave looked like they'd saved the empty nutella glasses and decided to reuse them. Blanket about the thickness of a shower curtain. If you come in winter, bring antibiotics and be prepared to catch pneumonia.

It's a 2 minute walk from Kings Cross Station. We didn't know London very well and this location was really central. I would recommend staying in the Kings Cross location for all attractions as you can get a main tube line to all the tourist sights from here. There's a cash point round the corner from the hotel and a Starbucks, McDonalds, Pret a Manger just up the road on the right hand side so we were extremly happy with the location 10/10 for us! HOTEL ROOMS: We specifically went for twin bed rooms and rooms next to each other (we had numbers 46 & 47). Our room was shockingly small it literally just fitted 2 tiny twin beds, half a wardrobe a tiny sink and no room for your suitcases so we couldn't even unpack! Not a recommended choice if you plan on coming back to the hotel to relax. Also TV only has 4 channels (if you are lucky). The window wouldn't open fully and the whole hotel was extremly hot - it felt like a sauna the whole time! Our friends room was better they were given a 'family room' Be warned! This is NOT family sized! But it was a great size for 2 people to share (I would recommend asking for a family room if I was staying here). It had a double bed (which was small) and a small twin bed, sink, chest of drawers, small cupboard and 2 windows which opened fully (as I said, hotel was like a sauna!). BATHROOMS: Can't comment on the on suite rooms as we opted for the really cheap rooms with shared toilet/shower facilities. Not a good idea! Luckily we are all easy going and got on with it but some people might come here and decide to leave if they are not used to these kind of facilities. The toilet and shower room were separate and absolutely tiny more like small cupboards. I would say if you were a slightly larger person you would not appreciate these small facilities. Showers worked okay and there was always hot running water but some of the toilets didn't flush very well. There are NO LIFTS in the hotel so please be aware of this if you have large, heavy suitcases and are put on the 3rd floor as there's 3 flights of windy stairs which are very small and kind of claustrophobic, so I would say this hotel is not suitable if you have difficulty walking. STAFF are nice and friendly and the breakfast is resonable. Although again breakfast area was small, dingy and very warm. Everything was clean but everything also needed a good lick of paint and redecorating the whole place looks very tired. To summarise this hotel is okay if you just want a bed for a night but not if you are the sort of person who likes to relax in a hotel room to take a break from London's hectic tourist stuff! I wouldn't stay here again. Would probably stay at the hotel a couple of doors down (not sure of it's name) but they are offering all on suite rooms at a very good hotel rate as well and we went into the lobby to have a look and it looked a much nicer hotel. I would not recommend this hotel unless you are used to staying in hostel type of places or you don't care what your hotel is really like. A good central base for travelling and tourist stuff for London and a good hotel price but that's about it.", "Date": "August 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "maine", "Title": "\u201cBelgrove, Forget it.\u201d", "Author": "maineevent", "ReviewID": "UR33476116", "Content": "Bad hotel. stayed deep in the bowels of the place. no light working in toilet or shower.

I went in about 9am on a Friday to ask about rooms and the receptionist who was I believe from Latvia was really nice and friendly. She had two basic rooms available one basement one top floor at \u00c2\u00a335 but when I asked to see them she said I'd have to come back after 11am. I went back in the evening about 6pm and another girl on reception who was from London gave me a key to see the basement room but wouldn't let me see the other room at the top as she said they were all the same. They just cannot be helpful can they ? What is it about some Londoners that they make an effort to be as unhelpful as they possibly can ? Anyway booked one night for the basement room for the Sunday to try it. Arrived Sunday afternoon and the basement room was OK.Room size was fine tv worked towel and soap but no plug for the sink( no big deal). Toilet at the end of the corridor but for me on my own that's fine. I just want a cheap room and \u00c2\u00a335 is OK as it's a good location. Stayed for two more days but on the last day there were some builders staying there in other basement rooms and if the windows are open even if their tv is low you still hear it. Fortunately the builder guy turned it off about 11pm as he had to get up early next morning. Breakfast was OK you help yourself to the eggs,bacon, sausage etc. The orange juice is actually orange squash mixed with cold water. If you fill up on breakfast you don't need that much for the rest of the day. I wish hotels were a bit more strict about noise I had to move to the Belgrove because the previous hotel round the corner had someone playing their tv at 4am. When I've been in hotels in the US and had to complain about noise they've dealt with it immediately.

The toilet had a flush handle made of chain links but no wooden or plastic handle at the end. It was shared by all in that corridor. There were 3 showers but I did not use them as there was nowhere to place the change of clothes as switching on the shower was going to wet the whole room which was small. There was no soap dish in the shower room. There was no towel hanger either. Just a hook on the door of the shower room which was bascially a shower head in an enclosed tiled room with no window and the ceiling paint was peeling. Breakfast was substantial in the morning. But minimum standards. We had hot food with minisausages, fried eggs, bacon, toast with butter, tomato and baked beans. The receptionists and canteen staff spoke what sounded like Russian.
