{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Fantastic base to explore the city Stayed at The Sakura with my girlfriend between 7-14 Dec 2008. It's located less than 10 mins from the busy Ikebukuro station and easy to find.We had a standard double room and was happy with what we had considering we were out and about for most of the day while we were there. The staff were all very polite and helpful and spoke great English. There was a small terrace cafe/bar area that added to the place as it allowed you to have a drink/food there if you'd had a long day. Ikebukuro itself was a great area of Tokyo - busy and vibrant by day and night but surprisingly quiet while we slept.I would recommend this for anyone who wanted to explore Tokyo and stay in a part of the city that also has so much going on...just remember it is more a hostel than a hotel so don't expect hotel standards when it comes to the room, etc.TIP: The hotel is split into two buildings on opposite sides of the street. The one opposite the terrace cafe/bar has safety deposit boxes for any valuable items.", "Date": "Jan 5, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR478814553", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "BristolTris"}, {"Content": "Great stay, great hotel and great neighborhood Wife and I stayed at the hotel from Nov 13- 19th. We are both in our 30s and travel overseas about 1 to 2 times per year.For the first 2 nights, we got a 'small double' bed and then we got the 'standard double' for the remainder. The hotel is an easy walk from the Ikebukuro station which is serviced by the Narita Express, so you get there from the Airport. Even though we have 2 large bags and 2 smaller bags, we made the walk from the station to the hotel in about 10 minutes.The hotel gives you excellent walking directions to get there from the station.Check in was easy and the rooms were nice. The 'standard double' was actually a decent size bed for us...like a queen size in the US. Room was well heated. The bathrooms are small but clean.The hotel location is excellent. Even though it is only 7 min walk from this huge train station, the hotel is peaceful, quiet, clean. The adjoining streets are very quiet too, so you should have no trouble sleeping.Hotel Staff speaks great English and are very responsive. There is also a cafe attached to the hotel where you can eat more 'western-continental food' if you're not comfortable with traditional Japanese food.There are plenty of eateries nearby, Japanese Ramen places, burger joints, pizza joints, small Indian restaurant, cafes, bakeries etc. Be wary though since almost all the menus are in Japanese and you may have to ask for an English menu (which may not be available)Also nearby, there are convenience stores and small grocery stores where you can buy fruit, breakfast, raw veggies (carrots etc), nuts, packaged goods, water and prepared food like rice cakes, tempura and other Japanese foods. Some of these small grocery stores take Credit Cards too.Under Ikebukuro station (Basement level 2), it can best be described as a 'continuous food fare'. Lots of vendors (mid price) selling everything from raw fish/veggies, to prepared sushi, fresh garden salads, tempura, dessert, chocolate...you name it. We eat salad usually at home for lunch, so we ended up getting a salad to go here each morning.All of the counters at this place (Ikebukuro Basement II) and several cafes around the hotel take Credit Cards too.From what I saw, most of the hotel guests were in their mid 20s, 30s and maybe some a little older too. It was not a 'party' type of place at all. I would really recommend this hotel to anyone thinking about it. Very reasonable price from Tokyo standards.", "Date": "Dec 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR398788122", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Arrege"}, {"Content": "Great stay at Sakura We are just home from a week in Japan where we stayed 4 nights at the Sakura Hotel in Ikebukuro. We are a family of 4 so struggled to find accommodation to suit us without having to get 2 rooms. The family room at Sakura had a double size bed and a set of bunks. The bathroom was tiny but that seems to be the norm in Japan. There was enough room to lay out our bags and not be too cramped. My parents also stayed at the Sakura and were in the other building opposite in a double room that was very spacious.The staff were very helpful and friendly with good English. They went out of their way to find a lost item of ours and without hesitation have sent it back to us in Australia.The hotel is an easy 5 min walk to the JR station. There is a 99yen (everything costs 99Y) grocery type store very close which was handy for snacks and drinks etc. I would stay there again as it is a good hotel and reasonably priced.", "Date": "Nov 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR589531466", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "travellin-with-boys"}, {"Content": "Want to get out quickly We were travelling up from Nagasaki, passed many cities, and finally Tokyo. We stayed at the Sakura Ikebukuro for 2 nights. It is not an excellent hotel to stay in.When we reached the hotel room, we were given a key, and that key have to be placed at the reception whenever we went out of the hotel.When we reached the room, I had a looked at the toilet and it was not flushed from the previous occupant. As there was no ventilation panels/ fans/ openings from the toilet, the toilet is the smelliest place in the room. Basically it is a plastic toilet capsule built into the room. On the 2nd day, when we went out and came back, we found that our room was cleaned, even though there was a notice in the lift stating that Room will only be cleaned upon request at reception, which we did not request. In the room, we found that one of my wife's socks was missing and made the complain to the reception. There was no action taken and they did not even looked for it. Not worth staying unless you are really on a super tight budget. You should be able to get better hotels around the area.", "Date": "May 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR776321501", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "JemnJo"}, {"Content": "Good Hotel in a good area My girlfriend and I spent four nights at the Hotel Sakura, previously Hayashi Hotel. It is a good choice, just five minutes walk from the Ikebukuro train station. The Narita Express links Ikebukuro stations directly to the international airports, although trains bound for Tokyo train station are much more frequent. From Ikebukuro station one can easily access various subway lines and JR train lines.The area is nice and safe, crowded with shops, restaurants and bars.We were given a double large room and then a bunk bed room for a second stay. Beds have nice and healthy cherry stones pillows. Both rooms were clean and had a tiny bathroom and toilet. There was a small TV set in both rooms with Japanese channels only. A refrigerator was available in each room.Pictures published on the Hotel website depicts exactly how the rooms look like.Breakfast is not included in room rates and there are no facilities, so you need to count on the many Marts and areas in the nearby area. Vending machines (tea, coffee and soda) are available at the entrance. In the morning, free hot tea and coffee is available near the reception desk.Staff is nice and welcoming.Last but not least: rates are very good.I am very happy I stayed at this hotel.", "Date": "Mar 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR638607654", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Silverino"}, {"Content": "Propre, pas cher pour Tokyo   showReview(22686963, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR620804516", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "david1975"}, {"Content": "economique et pratique       chambre japonaise", "Date": "Nov 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR850714737", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "doudoumwen"}, {"Content": "Super s\u8305jour   showReview(21214812, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR927453567", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Aurelie409"}, {"Content": "Propre, bien situ\u8305 et abordable!   showReview(19266924, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR578435465", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "mym21"}, {"Content": "sejour decevant   showReview(15187993, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR494949107", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "murielle92"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066460-d775810-r23283305-Sakura_Hotel_Ikebukuro-Toshima_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "775810", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
