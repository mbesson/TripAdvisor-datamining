Rome it self was an Amazing experience. some much to see so much to do the ice creams pizza pasta all delicious but just be vary of the various touts all over Rome selling fake goods I would say. just like any Country be careful of how you travel and stay to the main roads where most of the people are. just bear in mind I do not recommend this hotel for familie with small children at all !!!", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cCheap and cheerful budget hotel\u201d", "Author": "Lucyhaevey", "ReviewID": "UR126416928", "Content": "We stayed at the hotel Arcadia in January when on a 4 night break in Rome as part of a cheap last minute travel deal.

The hotel is more like a 2 star motel with NO facilities - you can't make a cuppa or even get one from a machine. There is NO BAR despite the hotel advertising one. There was a fridge in the room containing 2 bottles of water. Breakfast is continental but no fruit or yoghurt was available. The hotel is too far out of Rome to be called city centre. You have to take the metro to the end of line A (Anagnina) then get the 507 bus to the hotel. We arrived in the dark on a Friday night rush hour and tried to wait for taxi but there were none. Quite by accident I saw the 507 and the driver told us where to get off - 5 stops I think. The next morning we caught a bus at 9am and were in the centre at 9.40am with a good connection. The only good point about the journey into Rome is that it only costs 1 Euro. Unfortunatly you can't stay too late in Rome to enjoy the nightlife as you have to rely on the metro/bus otherwise get a very expensive taxi. The hotel shuttle operates only between 4pm and 10pm.to the metro station. If you telephone the hotel to let them know you want picking up, they will come to Anagnina. There is nothing to do once you are back at your hotel, there are no bars around so you are stuck in your room with Italian TV. We found a supermarket behind the hotel and bought beer and snacks but it closes at 8.30pm so stock up early. The hotel is noisy and looks unattractive as the bins are stored at the front of the hotel and there are industrial units across the road. The room we had (204) was clean and the bed was large and comfortable.The bathroom is decent but it is difficult to get a good shower with a hand held shower head.

The last metro train to Anagnina is at 9pm, so no late trains other than a Saturday night. Travel is really cheap however.

We are two girls age 25 and we arrived at Rome airport at about 10 at night. The reason I tell you this is because you NEED to be careful when paying for a taxi from the airport! I got into the taxi and asked the driver to put the journey on the meter as reading reviews Id heard this is the best way to get a fair price. Our driver fiddled with his meter machine and told us it would take 15 mins to get to the hotel. On arrival at the hotel, the driver fiddled with the meter again and after just a 10 minutes journey charged us 50 euros! Being late at night and 2 young girl, we decided to give him the benefit of the doubt and I gave him a 50 euro note. As I put my purse away he said to me 'youve only give me 10 euro and showed me a 10 euro note (same colour as a 50 note), i tried checking my money again and he was very pushy and said 'theres a 50' which i handed over, he gave me the 10 back. Needless to say, I was well and truly had, paying 90 euros for a 10 minute taxi! If you book this hotel, the journey shouldnt be any more than 30 EUROS. Anyway, back to the hotel... so we came in and the guy on the desk wasn't very welcoming or friendly. There are no bars, restaurants around the hotel. All there is is a suprtmarket (closed at night when we got there) and a 'pizzeria' which i put in inverted commas because it was more like a type of kebab shop/cafe, which was full of young local boys. because were hungry we decided to try it out and ventured over towards it but were followed but didnt like the look of it and were then followed until we go back to the hotel. Hungry and unhappy, we went on the internet straight away (which we weren't asked to pay for) and booked another hotel called the Hotel Gambrinus in Porta Pia. We stayed the night in the Hotel Arcadia. It was noisy and couldn't sleep, especially as the dumpster bins (right at the front of the hotel) were being emptied by dustbin men with beeping vans at midnight! Breakfast was basic but OK, again the staff weren't friendly, you just got on with it yourself really. To get to Rome (because by this point we didn't feel like we were IN rome!) you take the 507 Bus which come fairly often. You dont have to pay on for the bus I dont think. The metro is 1 euro per use or you can get a 11 euro tourist ticket which I recommend getting from the very beginning because if youre like us, you use the metro alot! (The metro is so easy!) I can't remember where you get off, but then you get on the metro at the Aranina (sp?) line and take the metro to wherever you want to go. In all this will take 10 mins plus half hour to get to the main Termini station. We are so glad though that we changed hotels. We stayed at the Hotel Gambrinus like I said, and this cost us \u00a370 each for two nights, but the hotel was gorgeous and the staff were so friendly and we were only a ten min walk to the metro and then using the metro took us anywhere. It was nice for us to go out in the morning, come back in the late afternoon to refresh for an hr or so and then go back out. I wont say don't book this hotel. It suits the purpose of having a room to sleep in, but dont it doesnt really feel like youre really on a nice holiday in Rome or Italy and I couldnt relax until we left. That said, if you plan on going into rome centre early and then coming back late, this is ok and fits the job for a clean room to sleep in. Hope this helps!

Upon entering the rather basic and depressing room which contained little more than a camp bed and a twelve inch portable television i was then faced with the challenge of hauling up a metal screen shutter covering the balcony window with the passion of the Hunchback of Notre Damne combined with the willpower of a 1930's Wall Street banker not to jump onto the vacant and tart filled streets below. A short walk around the neighbouring streets revealed nothing more than the motivation to learn a little of the local lingo, which included ' I'VE BEEN ROBBED' and 'I'VE BEEN HAD'. With absolutely nothing to do but return to the depressing prison of the Arcadia, we chose to peruse the selection of drinks that the mini bar had to offer, but without a successful bid for my left kidney on e-bay, decided that our money would be better spent. After settling down for the night on a camp bed worthy of an average Afgan refugee, we awoke to the promise of checking out and utilised the in house internet facility to book another hotel in a distant place called 'Rome' which bore a remarkable resemblance to the place we had originally wished to visit through Thomas Cook. After a one and a half hour journey, we arrived in the city we had hoped to see and saw the welcoming outline of the vatican and the aged marble walls of the Colosseum, rather than the corregated iron roofs of the local industrial estate and decaying suburban rot that the Arcadia had to offer.

It's not the hotel's fault - if you only want convenience for an airport then grab a room here for sure. I place the blame for my review of the hotel firmly at the door of Thomas Cook who had this hotel on offer for a city break when it just simply shouldn't. It took us nearly an hour and three quarters to get into Rome itself using the bus, metro and our reliable feet in order to avoid the truly extortionate taxi fees which had we stayed here for the duration, we would have ended up using out of sheer frustration. There was nothing close to the hotel - no restaurants, no bars and certainly no Roman sights. The hotel itself is advertised as a 3 star but I'm not sure that appropriately reflects it as the new hotel we booked instead was 4 star and of a far superior quality in every way.

Thought the location was worth sacrificing to get a better rate. How wrong we were! Many other problems too. A real horror story. Do not book this hotel. Read on to see why. Got in, spent ages trying to unlock the door, room very basic and poorly decorated. But we could handle that. Until the TV didn't work, the Air Conditioning didn't work and the Bathroom was awful. Asked to be moved room. They gave us the room next door, which had no additional inside lock. When we asked why/if we could be moved again, they just assured us that it was safe and the room was one of the newer ones. Bathroom was fine, but Air Conditioning still did not work, TV had no remote. We asked about this. They said they would bring a TV remote up. Never did. They said the Air Conditioning was off because it wasn't summer. It was 26 degrees. We figured since we were here to see Rome, that didn't matter so much and we'd get over it. Still, it was annoying. Journied into Rome. First you must get a bus to Anagnina Station. It only costs 1 Euro, and can be used with the metro if your journey is within 75 minutes. Bus takes around 15/20 minutes. Anagnina is a rough area. Dirty, lots of dodgy characters. Did not feel safe there compared with the rest of Rome and would definatly not recommend coming back too late at night from Rome and be hanging around there. Metro takes you into Termini in about 25 minutes, which isn't bad. But after a day walking around Rome, the commute in and out is very tiring. Especially when you have to get back to a Line A station from wherever you are in Rome, then spend 25 minutes (usually standing) on a subway past, I believe about 15 stops, then waiting around in an unsavoury area, then the 15 minute bus. Bus doesn't operate on a sunday, hotel provides a small shuttle service, which is helpful (one good point). Worst part of all is though, at nighttime, the noise is terrible. Paper thin walls. You can hear everything going on in the neighbouring rooms and in the corridors. Worse still, there is a restaurant just beside the hotel. So if your room is anywhere near it, you won't be able to get to sleep until about 2.A.M, because crowds of diners and drinkers shout, laugh and scream into the night. It feels as if they are right beside you. Even earplugs do little to help. You'll then get woken up again about 6 or 7 by people leaving their rooms with a thunderous roar. In conclusion, we were prepared to get over the smaller inconveniences of the TV, lock and Bathroom, but the Air Conditioning, Noise and Commute meant we had no choice but to move into the centre of Rome for our final night, loosing the money already paid in the process. That hotel was much better and yet rated a 3* also. This hotel deserves to be dropped a few stars.

It should cost around \u20ac60 from the airport to the Hotel - but taxi touts really rip you off - I said \u20ac60 - they said \u20ac75 !! Luckily the Hotel issue you with vouchers for a set fee - you pay either \u20ac20 to Ciampino (apporx) or \u20ac60 to Fumicino. They even call the taxi's for you so once you hand over the voucher - they can't argue or they'll put their contract in jeopardy. Firstly - on arrival at around 8pm Sunday evening - I was quite upset. Our holiday was supposed to be romantic but after seeing the state of the hotel I got quite upset indeed - considering I had actually paid quite a lot of money for the Sunday-Friday stay. My boyfriend wanted to phone Thomas Cook and get an exchange but we agreed we'd give it a try. AND ARE WE LUCKY WE DID!!!!!!!! What the hotel lacked in 'quality' - the staff certainly made up for in customer service. There is from who I consider the possible manager, a pleasant grey haired man couldn't have been any more helpful. He gave us a map showing where we get the incredibly excellent service of the 507 bus to Anagnina Metro station - this then taking you along a long line of attractions - sights and historial legends. My advice is buy a ticket from reception for \u20ac1 each - this can be used on any bus and any metro route - but is only valid for 75 minutes. Therefore I suggest for the amount of times you'll likely be jumping on and off the metro that you buy a weekly ticket - which costs \u20ac16 euro - you can purchase these from machines at metro's - but for safety and not to waste your change - i'd highly recommend buying these from newsagents - Giornalo ?? There is one at Anagnina before you get onto a metro. Breakfast is wonderful considering I didn't want to stay there - you could have a choice of tea / coffee / espresso (apparently lethal) chocco latte / hot chocolate (very rich) or cappucino. Then also milk / orange / lemon or other juices. Selection of bread rolls, choco crossaints / vanilla crossaints, cake (which sounds funny but is actually very nice). Also jams, honey etc. The waiting staff are friendly and speak good english. Although a lot of people that stay there are in fact mostly Italians. The sights that are worth seeing - Vatican is a must - Spanish steps / and I'd really recommend 'Rome Christian Tour' as you get an all day pass for \u20ac13 from Termini and it takes you around nearly all the sights. Behind the Hotel is a pizza take away - we did not eat there as it soooo did not look appealing. The hotel offer a shuttle to a nearby restaurant about 2km away - food excellent but staff speak poor english so we stuck to what we could pronounce - carbonara! Supermarket behind the hotel is excellent / very very cheap, wine and beer and snacks etc. Well worth a visit if you stay at Arcadia as drinks in mini bar are minimal - no beer only lager etc. We found the gym - near the basement carpark - but couldn't find a solarium, and we didn't notice the bar ever open. Yes the hotel was basic, but it was clean. The staff certainly made up for everything the hotel lacked as they were so helpful and friendly and really helped us out. We used the hotel as somewhere to sleep at night as most of the day we were out sightseeing. One word of advice - EARPLUGS !!!! Highly recommended as local kids hang round pizza place at back of hotel, and you can hear EVERYTHING that goes on in your neighbours room! So if you wish to experience YOUR romantic week away rather than your NEIGHBOURS week away - get yourself a good pair of earplugs. I could sleep through an explosion but sadly not with those walls. Happy stay and it wasn't as bad as we'd originally thought. In fact as it's so easy to get around Rome- i'd probably go again. Cannot fault the travel system. So if you just want a very comfy bed for the night, bit of brekkie, and somewhere to get a shower - get yourself to the ARCADIA !!!!!", "Date": "February 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "Graham&mary", "ReviewID": "UR6786879", "Content": "I booked a short break for me and my girlfriend in rome and read that this hotel was ideal for everything. From Ciampino airport it is about 15mins in the taxi. I read up about the local taxi drivers ripping people off so be carefull. They were going to charge us 45 euro's until i declined. They agreed 30euro's, which i still wasnt happy about but what can you do. The drivers over there realy dont care so i wouldnt advise hiring a car as you would find it crazy. We arived at night so didnt see the surrounding area too much. The hotel is clean and the staff are very friendly. Our room consisted of a double bed and a mini bar. Which is quite reasonable for the drinks, mainly water and cans of diet coke also 2 beers only a few euro's each. Ask for a map from the hotel reception, which if we didnt have we would not of been able too manage. It was clear and very well layed out even for the less geograpghical person. All the places you could want too visit are on the map. The local bus is around the corner from the hotel and takes you to the metro station where you can get on and off at any place you want to visit. At the metro station you can buy a 3 day travel pass costing 11euro's per person. That will allow you to travel unlimited on the bus and metro system. We didnt encounter any pick pockets you hear of, but just be carefull especialy on the metro's and in the city. Around the corner from the hotel was \"pippo's pizza\" a friendly pizzaria! cheap aswel. Ideal for a late night snack. There is a local restauraunt close by, and if you ask at reception they will take you for free. This hotel is an ideal base for young couple's and family's. The breakfast is basic but sets you up untill lunch. There are not any bars close by that we noticed. And i wouldnt like to travel back from the centre of rome on the metro at night drunk.

We found reception to be very helpful and they provided us with a map for the buses/metro. The hotel is very basic, but very clean and comfortable. The bus stop was right outside the hotel and takes you stright to Anaganina from there you catch the metro - this is by far the best way to travel around Rome and also very very cheap, we never had any probs with theives or pickpockets (but take care of handbags etc still as you can never be to sure), the only thing we did experience was people getting on the trains begging for money, but just avoid eye contact and they won't bother you. The only problem we had was on the Friday when there was a bus strike from early morning right through till about 6pm so we were stuck @ the hotel all day which was pretty boring as it is in the middle of nowhere and there doesn't seem to be any english channels on the tv!!! Overrall our stay at the hotel was quiet and comfortable and was ideal for what we needed, which was really just a place to sleep on a budget as we were out site seeing most of the time. Just one other thing to mention is that the walls are quite thin so if you stay in the hotel just have a thought for the people in the rooms next to you as on our stay we had one night where the couple next door desided to have a massive drunken argument and we could here the whole thing!!!

We arrived at the hotel at 11.00, given a very warm welcome and was suprised to be told that our rooms were ready well before our check in time. The room itself (302) was smashing with one of the comfortablest beds i have had the pleasure of sleeping in. The bathroom was suberb with a large shower cubicle with water pressure that would remove skin given the chance, very well equipped with soft white towels, shower gel, shampoo and hair dryer. The room we were in also had patio doors and a balcony with a view towards rome (not much to look out at but nice and quite) there was a TV with limited channels, wardrobe and dressing table. TIP... leave the aircon on when you go out for the day it isn't the most powerful of units but is refreshing enough to keep the room cool. The breakfast is basic but does give a good start to the day (beware the coffee its lethal) To get into Rome takes about on average 30-40 mins via bus and metro the bus stop is just around the corner from the hotel and run frequently in the week (when they want on sundays but down the road) Bus No. 507 takes you to the bus/metro station you can buy your combined bus/metro ticket from the hotel or at the metro station and very cheap to buy (\u20ac16.00 for 7 days). Ask the hotel for a free map it has all the metro routes on and places of interest. The gym and sauna are very basic but overall the hotel is EXCELLENT and i would recommend staying there to anyone and for the price they charge it is very very good value for money and with it being away from the centre it is also nice and peaceful on an evening. As for the hotel staff if they worked at Mcdonalds they would all have 5 stars on there badge and be managers in weeks. (LOL) there english was great and all the staff that we met were only to happy to help and offer advice. ( i would stay at the hotel for the staff alone) There is a small restaurant to the rear of the hotel, offered a very basic menu and we had to wait in excess of an hour for our meal and even then it wasn't complete. The supermarket is great for stocking up on drinks and fresh fruit and all very cheap. Take a trip to the TIME ELEVATOR early in your visit as they give you an extremely handy tourist book that is full of maps, museums markets and routes to follow. The taxi from Ciampino airport cost us \u20ac30.00 but we agreed the price before setting off, the first taxi driver we asked wanted \u20ac35.00. On your return to the airport buy a voucher from hotel reception. When in Termini make sure you have plenty of change for toilets as on average it cost 70 cent.

This place looked close enough but after a hard day of touring the grand city and trying to get over jet lag this place was far from perfect. I looked at the online reviews for this site at other travel sites and thought not bad. It wasn't until I attempeted to get there that I realized this place wan't what it originally advertised. Okay It is very close to public transportation if it happens to be working at the time. The subway is still under construction so it stops working at 10:00 PM after that you have to take a bus (which is not reliable timewise, so much so that they do not post a time schedule, they get there when they get there!) to the end of the subway line and wait for another to take you. Not so bad but when you are standing outside in the dead of winder it was horrible. When we finally got to the hotel we had to walk a block to get there and saw the neighborhood we were in, think Van Nuys, California so you know what I mean. They don't look like they cared much on the outside with dog poop and weeds everwhere. When we got there the staff were super nice but our room looked like something out of motel six (the pictures that I originally looked at were different). After a hard day I could really care less but the super thin walls made it impossible to sleep when our neighbors keeps laughing and shouting part of the night. The view into the countryside was beautiful but the hotel looked like something out of Tijuana. On the plus side it was next to a grocery store called PAM which was great for cheap food. That comes in handy because there is not much of a choice food wise. They do have a free Italian style breakfast which basically is just bread and coffee. They do have cereal and milk but the milk is extremely rich which I wasn't used to. So some rules of thumb for this hotel: Know how to get there bus wise, if you wait too late you have to take the evening bus and that takes a while (until they finally finish the subway construction). Be well versed in the bus routes and when they run. Take in mind there is a different evening line after 10:00 PM so you do not wait for a bus that will never come. DO NOT TAKE A TAXI TO THE HOTEL! You will be charged $60-$80 for a quick ride on the bus. They are pretty aggresive so try to ignore them. Try to get a room that is at least one room separated from your neighbors if you want to sleep. Also be sure to get the numbers to the hotel and VERIFY them before hand, every time we tried to call the hotel we realized that they listed their fax not their telephone number.There is a plus to this hotel in that you have your own bathroom (which you have to pay extra for in the center of Rome) and the low prices. The staff is really nice. And once you take the subway you are local to everything so its not that bad. Overall it is an ok hotel if all you want to do is lay down your head. Just don't expect anything fancy. Overall it was okay.

Everything is shut tight on that day! As for the hotel... took a looong time to get there. From the train station had to travel the metro right to the end of the long line. From there it is possible to take a bus but not advisable on the first attempt as the stop is a little unclear. A cab from the metro to the hotel was 15 euro. I asked the price first and that is what the cabbie quoted me even though the meter read 8 euro and then went up to only just over 10 when he hit a button to add on charge for luggage. So definately got ripped off there. Got to the front desk, was given the room key and off we went. At this point we were both a little nervous as the area is very much in the \"ghetto\". Very unnerving and dodgey felling. The room was ok, bathroom satisfactory (bath with shower hose but no shower curtain to keep the water IN the bathtub area). Did find a silverfish bug in the bathroom too... eww. English tv was only cnn and a show or two on mtv. so not much there to keep entertained. I went down to the front desk and asked where i could get some food. I was told that the only place is the pizza place out back. That was the good part of the location. Inexpensive and tastey food, family run and open on christmas. On boxing day the bus route was very odd. The front dest said nothign about changed routes. On the way back 7 of us from the hotel ended up totally accross town in the evening. When we were talking to them about the hotel they said that they found the hotel alright, breakfast was great and the car service was a great help. Breakfast!!? Car service!? My friend and i were told nothing about this any of the times that we were at the front desk!!! We were on day 4 of our 5 day stay so taht really got to me.
