Arriving at the hotel I got a damp, cellar room with something that could not be even named a window. After complaining to the receptionist, I was moved to a ground floor room, which was tiny, still smelly and next to slamming entrance door. Bed was totally uncomfortable with springs hurting my back. Maybe the rooms in upper levels are OK as the other reviewers say, but those were simply not acceptable. I have moved out the next day, but the hotel charged for the entire stay, claiming \"early departure\".", "Date": "January 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow", "Title": "\u201cVery clean and nice\u201d", "Author": "Lafeevert", "ReviewID": "UR26197713", "Content": "We stayed there for 3 days in March and it was even beyond expectations? especially bearing in mind that the rate was only GBP 40 per night. Really qood value for money, room is tiny, as well as the hotel itself, but newly refurbished and very clean, daily room service. Wi-fi in the room. Highly recommended if you are on budget. We stayed in room #14 on 3-d floor and the only disadvantage was the window to a narrow well with other windows in front of it, so with open window you can hear baby crying or other quests talking loudly ))", "Date": "March 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Romania", "Title": "\u201cVery nice and clean\u201d", "Author": "ImMeRomania", "ReviewID": "UR23938545", "Content": "We really enjoyed staying there. The room was small, but we had everything we need there. Even coffee and tea so you can prepare it by yourself in the room. The shower was great and clean. We had soap, shower gel, towels, hairdryer, and if you needed more, you could ask from the reception for free. They don't have breakfast but if you want, you can order the night before, for 3,5 GBP and you will have it next morning - room service delivered. I understood that it will not be called Brindle house hotel anymore, but Best Western Hotel Annexe. And beside that, it was at a walking distance of Backingham Palace and more turist attractions.
