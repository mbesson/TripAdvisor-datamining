I was surprised about the size of the room, it was much bigger than I expected. The same happened with the shower, it was huge! The bed was just perfect, kingsize with four pillows, exactly what I needed after spending the whole day walking through the Teotihuacan pyramids and Antara mall. The room was perfectly isolated from outside noise, so I slept like a baby. It also had everything you see in most hotels: TV, security box, coffee machine, Wi-Fi (which I didn't use, but I suppose that works properly). The only thing I didn't like was the breakfast, very poor in my opinion.

Unfortunately, the cable connection was not faster and I was quite often not able to access the internet at all. The breakfast buffet is boring and every day the same, minimalistic food is offered.

So it was to my utter disappointment when I checked in and they tried to pass a regular room for something I had paid extra for. Of course there was the usual yada yada about the room not being ready--they could have saved me the trip upstairs with a nice apology, because I was willing to wait. Anyway, that being said, the right room on the right floor turned out spacious, clean and perfectly amenable. No bath tub but water pressure was good and showers were sizable. This hotel though seems to be running on very little staff--there was never more than ONE person behind the front desk while I was there..so this person had to answer calls and do front of store duties to the detriment of everyone! Why they think they can manage on such meager man power is beyond me. Certainly, the front desk was always in a rush to ferry you off. Just getting them to get help for their laundry was a forty minute waste of time and effort. There is no room service in this hotel, which I find rather strange for what claims to be geared for businessmen. The business center is a sad hole with hardly anything working. Oh and the free wi-fi in the hotel suffers from intermittent failure. Really quite useless. The gym is a sad story too. Breakfast was your most basic hotel fare--no specials here, nothing different from the most basic of cafeteria fare served in a cafeteria manner. So, no, I did not look forward to breakfast on any day. That being said, the place seems fairly central and is beside a great mall with good restaurants, shopping and movie theaters. The Museo Antropolgica and Modern Art are but short bus rides away in nearby Chapultepec Park and Zona Rosa has it's own fair share of interesting characters.

We were in town for a cousin's wedding. We had 2 rooms, 1 king and 1 with 2 double beds. The rooms were very nice, the beds were slightly hard, but bearable. The tvs were large and got more channels than I expected. The bathrooms were quite nice, with large showers. The view from the king room faced the street and was great. There were floor to ceiling windows, which were great! Breakfast was included and was great!! Many different options, from fruit, cereal, toast, and yogurt, to delicious Mexican options like frijoles, chilaquiles, pan dulce, jamon, y huevos. There was fresh-squeezed juice and good coffee each morning. The service was also very good. Remember that the tip for breakfast wasnt included, so we made sure to leave at least $1US or 10 pesos per person each morning. The hotel is very new. The glass in the lobby and spiral staircase up to the breakfast area is very nice. The location of the hotel was also very good and safe. It was centrally located on Reforma, near Insurgentes. There was a modern mall right next door, with Sanborns, Starbucks, and a few other good restaurants right there. The hotel also had high speed internet in the rooms, and they provide a computer with internet access in the lobby. The hotel let us have a late checkout without charging any more. We left at 3pm, rather than 1pm, as is their listed checkout time. The only negative about the hotel was that they had told us, upon booking the reservation, that a crib would be available.
