We briefly left our room for a meal, but did not feel particularly safe walking in the dark, so headed back for an early night! Our room was dingy and dark with no natural light- fine if the light was brighter than a candle! The bathroom smelt like sewerage, the shower screen was off its hinge and the toilet bowl was not secured to the floor. Paper thin walls allowed us to listen to our neighbours TV all night.

It's not a short walk, but it's definitely not a very far walk. The hotel is located in an area without as many tourists which I like. The area really comes alive at night. The hotel is nice, but it's not equipped with a/c and you are only allowed 1 fan per room. If you are staying in a room with the windows facing the interior of the hotel (not along Via Tiburtina), it's manageable with the windows open, but not if you are along Via Triburtina. I'm from Texas so I'm accustomed to being warm, but it's difficult to go to sleep when there are restaurants and bars right below your hotel room ( see for yourself - google street view -http://bit.ly/bxIqg8). The store fronts to the left of the hotel are open at night as you can see from the google street view image). To Hotel Felice's credit, they did move us after not being able to sleep in that room. We were able to move to a room that had the windows facing the interior of the hotel. The other glitch we had was when the hotel staff asked for cash at check out. To their credit, they mentioned in on the first day and not at check out, but if you take a credit card as a deposit, you ought to be able to pay with it. I ended up paying half credit card and half cash. Sorry, I don't like to complain, but I feel the product is a bit misrepresented. Now, onto more pleasant things about the hotel! There is a terrific pizza shop. Really, pizza is pizza to me, but the service and the price were fantastic! It is Pizza Tonde - Il mattarello d'oro (not sure that is the real name) - it's on Via Degli Equi (look at google maps here: http://bit.ly/bt6Zro). Basically, it's has good service, great price, and it's really close to the hotel. You can get 2 large pizzas and 2 drinks for 11 Euros. It took 3 healthy male appettites to eat all of the pizza. There is also a good gelato place across the street from the pizza place as well. Overall, Hotel Felice is probably an OK place to stay, but I really think it's unfair to guests that there are restaurants and bars below their rooms when there only form of air circulation is a small fan and open windows especially when it's warm outside. The place is probably a lot more favorable in the colder months.

So arriving to the hotel via train, bus, or taxi is very costly. By taxi it is about 50-60 euros. By train and then bus it's about 15euro per person. The hotel is about a 15 minute walk away from Termini Station which a large bus/train/metro station from where you can go nearly everywhere in Rome. However, that 15 minute walk is quite unpleasant, especially at night. The streets are dirty and graffiti decorates every square foot of wall. While we stayed at the hotel (5 days) a car in front of the hotel was badly broken into. So the area is clearly not very safe. There are no places of interest at a walking distance from the hotel. Taking metro or bus everyday is necessary to see the sights. *Room* The rooms are quite small (like most in Europe) and only some have bathrooms included. We stayed in one that did. The towels are not changed every day, which is a small detail, but after 3 days it was unpleasant to have old towels. The television was not working and the staff was not helpful in fixing it. **There is no air conditioning*** which is probably my greatest complaint. In Rome, most tourists go to the ancient sites and see the many things that make Rome famous, which means walking - a lot. So when you get back exhausted, hot, and tired, the last thing you want is your hotel room to be humid, hot, and cramped. The room was hotter than the outside at times, and the only way to try to cool it down was to open the windows and turn on the tiny table fan that was provided. It was unbearable to sleep and the loud street noise was not helpful. And to top it off, on our last night there, the rusty water pipes leaked and our bathroom flooded and eventually got the entire room wet. The only person working at the desk begrudgingly came to help us and finally made us clean it up ourselves with - a dust pan and broom! *Staff* Needless to stay the staff was not very helpful as illustrated with the whole flooding issue. And there were no moments in which they really seemed to care whether we were comfortable or enjoying our stay. -- Most of the reviews I read for this hotel were very good, so I was looking forward to a good stay. Unfortunately it was not so. The air conditioning is really a problem and I would never want to stay in Rome in the summer without it again.

A stay at this \u201chotel\u201d is like that of a stray dog winding up in a cage at the local pound. There are so many horrible aspects to this hotel. I\u2019ll start at the beginning. We copied directions from the hotel\u2019s website to walk from Roma Termini. The directions could not have been more incorrect. It took us about 45 minutes to find the place. And if you are walking be prepared: this hotel is not in a nice neighborhood - especially at night - and it\u2018s a good 10-15 minute trek through the slums from Termini. We were actually afraid to walk from Roma Termini to the hotel at night. We had a hard time finding the hotel at first because the entire building -- and street block -- is covered in graffiti. Sweaty and tired, we were buzzed into the hotel (another sign of the type of neighborhood). The hotel staff speak absolutely no English whatsoever, which is completely fine as we shouldn\u2019t expect them to, but just know that there is no tolerance or acceptance of foreigners. My two travel companions and myself meandered our way through the check-in process. The problem is that the man at the reception counter treated us horribly and kept screaming at us in Italian. Listen, buddy, if we didn\u2019t understand you the first time we\u2019re not going to understand you the sixth time. Then he demands we give him our passports to \u201chold\u201d them until we check out. It was bad enough we couldn\u2019t grasp what he was saying, but then him yelling at us to give our passports was bizarre. We reluctantly handed them over. The man at the counter was so nasty and rude I totally expected him to sell our passports on the black market leaving us lost in Rome with no identification. We all had bags with us and were staying on the second floor. Hotel Felice has no elevator -- and this place has a lot of stairs that twist and turn. The trip up to the second floor was almost as bad as the journey from Termini. When we were leaving to check out, we just threw our bags down the stairs and hoped for the best. Needless to mention, nobody from the hotel staff offered to help us either time. The room: all things considered it was a normal cheap hotel room: beds, a small desk and a bathroom. We had a triple room with a private bath. The problem was the temperature. It was a hot August day so we weren\u2019t expecting the room to be cool, but the temperature in the room was easily 10-15 degrees more than the temperature outside. Plus, this place has no air conditioning and virtually no circulation. The three of us were looking for a room to chill out and relax in and instead we had to go outside in the sweltering heat to escape the heat in our room. Like Hotel Felice, it was a lose-lose situation. We spent the day touring Rome and, begrudgingly, returned to Hotel Felice at night. There was another man at the front desk who yelled at us for taking our key with us. Apparently, you are supposed to check in the key whenever you leave. Fine. Whatever. Then he throws our passports back to us (couldn\u2019t get a good price on the market I guess\u2026) and mumbles something in Italian. Our room was just as hot at night as it was during the day. We all took turns getting up during the night and taking ice cold showers to cool our body temperatures. Another thing that kept us up during the night was the constant pounding and slamming outside in the hallway. The doors are paper thin and do not block any noise -- at all. Also, it was *always* noisy outside. Motorcycles revved their engines all night long and there seems to be one constant party outside the hotel room . Given the neighborhood and surrounding environment, the party was probably a large drug transaction that lasted for hours. Unless you are a very, very heavy sleeper, you will not get any rest at this place. We woke up early to leave this horrible place (it\u2019s not like we slept anyway) and a foul odor seemed to have seeped in throughout the night. It was absolutely rancid. We couldn\u2019t leave fast enough. Check-out was another ordeal. Suffice to say we paid them whatever they wanted just so we could leave as soon as possible. Thankfully, we had only booked a room for one night. Any longer and we would have just left and gone to another hotel where the rooms weren\u2019t 115 degrees, didn\u2019t smell like rotted egg and dirty socks and didn\u2019t have to worry about being offered heroine outside the front door.

I definitely don't expect to go to another country and have everyone speak English so I didn't mind the communication barrier. However, I must admit for the Rome hospitality industry the staff definitely didn't speak a lot of English. Rooms: I booked the double room with shared bathroom. I thought the bathroom would be shared amongst 2-4 rooms. Upon arrival my boyfriend and I discovered it is 2 washrooms (located on one end of the hallway) amongst the whole floor. There were approximately 10 rooms on the floor and unfortunately we were in a room at the opposite end of where the washrooms were. My impression is this was definitely more like a hostel rather than a hotel (and I have stayed in both before). Location: I read the reviews that the walk to Termini station was far however I thought that was subjective based on how fast an individual walks. Now that I've experienced it I will confirm the walk is about 10 minutes (depending on the route you take) one is on Via Marsala (the longer route but you will get to walk on sidewalks and not through a tunnel) the other is Via Giolotti (through a tunnel and past some tracks). I would definitely say this hotel is more like a hostel. There actually seemed to be quite a few backpackers that stayed there. I wouldn't recommend staying more than 2 nights at this \"hotel\".

My room stank like a sewer (there was a bidet actually IN the shower). I opened the window to get some air and was kept up the entire night by a group of people who congregated directly under the window. I was supposed to stay for 3 nights but left after one. Despite what the Felice website says about a one night penalty for a late cancellation, they charged me for the entire 3 nights. Terrible service. I also felt like the walk from Termini was pretty desolate and as a woman travelling alone, I did not feel safe (I am an experienced traveller, am often on my own, and know the good areas from the bad). You can get a much better deal for the same price elsewhere in Rome. The Felice is a complete ripoff. There are other hotels in Rome that are the same price and offer much much more (air conditioning, closer to Termini etc.). For what they offer, the Felice should be charging at least 30-40% less.

I planned to be in Rome during the second week of January (four days in total) to attend the graduation of a friend of mine at La Sapienza University; this was the main reason of my choice towards Hotel Felice (that is very closed to the University). Honestly, the hotel is not the best I\u2019ve ever been in my life, but what surprised me was the general environment of the structure: my room were very clean, the reception desk (but at the end all the staff) was very kind to point out the best way to have a look of the city and advised me on the shortest way to reach my destinations. Outside, as I\u2019ve mentioned before, the hotel is placed very closed to Uniservity and obviously into an area frequented by students; so I found a lot of pubs, wine bars and restaurants (there\u2019s a good choice of places to spend the spare time). This is the reason why I would recommend this hotel to a range of people from 20 to 50 years old (there\u2019s some noise from outside during week-end!!). I\u2019ve not used them but I saw that there\u2019s wi-fi connectivity (toll-free service) and also the hotel can arrange some touristic tour into the city. I hope that my opinion could be helpful for you Have fun!!!
