They are absolutely correct. The hotel is entered from the main street of the island via an inner courtyard. The rooms are on average slightly larger than many European hotel rooms. The staff are terrifically helpful and completely bilingual. The combination of the historic with modern design is most charming. If you are fortunate to stay on the second floor (we were in Room 202), you will wake to exposed beams overhead. You may wake late because there is no street noise on this quiet island in the center of Paris. The only thing that might upset you is the price of breakfast (~18 Euros per person for juice, coffee and croissants). However, a block away are several local brasseries where the same breakfast can be had for about 7 Euros. Rue Saint Louis is lined with shops and restaurants of every type. While the crowds on many Paris streets can be overwhelming and tiring at times, it is nice to return to I'lle Saint Louis where tranquility reigns (except on Sunday). Yes on Sunday, the crowds are huge as many locals descend on the island to shop (stores in most other areas are closed) and eat Berthillion ice cream, a local favourite. The island and hotel are literally about 200 meters from I'lle de Cite the home of Notre Dame Cathedral and the hidden wonders of the stained glass in Saint Chapelle. The left bank (tourists abound) is only a block or two further. You can easily walk to the Louvre in about 20 minutes at a relaxed pace. This is the perfect hotel and location for couples wishing to experience a romantic visit. Oh yes, don't go to Paris in the summer - visit in early October when the weather is fine and the maddening hordes of tourists have gone back to suburbia.", "Date": "October 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cPerfection\u201d", "Author": "BunyipJr", "ReviewID": "UR119316863", "Content": "An absolutely amazing location!

We were traveling with our 10 and 12-year old, and have been to Paris several times and understand how small most hotel rooms are. We decided to splurge and rented a suite, which said it came with air conditioning and free wifi. The suite turned out to be two very small rooms stacked on top of each other connected by a curved staircase, with only air conditioning and wifi on the top floor. Neither the a/c nor the wifi reached the downstairs, requiring the upstairs occupants to turn the a/c on as high as possible and hope that some drifted downstairs. The only window in the bottom room was actually a glass door which opened onto a public hallway and courtyard, making opening that door to let in some air completely impossible. The windows on the first floor of the suites section were covered only with a thin, gauzy material, so that when one returned to the room at night, the other occupants were completely visible in their rooms if they had the lights on, even though they expected that they had privacy with the \"curtains\" shut. Enough said on that... This made the downstairs part of our suite dark, hot and claustrophobic, and very unpleasant for the two people sleeping downstairs. At 560 Euros a night ($785), it was honestly a terrible value. We were traveling with a group, and were frankly sick when we saw what the other members in our party had booked at a third the price. Other negatives were the price of breakfast: 18 Euros ($25) per person per day, which on top of the $785 we were already paying seemed outrageous, and the fact that they do not allow outside food to be brought in \"for health reasons,\" even though they serve room service in the rooms. (Read: we prefer you buy our food from us.) Positives: friendly and helpful front desk staff, nice dog in the lobby, a brilliant location in the city, accessible to everything, nice upstairs bathroom, good water pressure, comfortable beds.

It has become a home from home. You cannot beat the romance of the Ile St Louis, a small island barely 100m wide and 300m long right in the centre of Paris, barely 200m from the rear of Noter Dame: it is Paris's best kept secret. The narrow main street is lined with delightful shops selling clothes, artisan food, arts and crafts, antiques - and the island's best product, without a doubt, Berthillon ice cream: taste it and forget every other ice cream you have ever tasted. There are a handful of small restaurants and, at the end of the island nearest Notre Dame, a couple of bars, where you can sit and watch the world go by. This is a village right in the middle of Paris and its main street, which throngs with people by day, becomes quite at other times. Get off the main street and the rest of the island is blissfully quiet, so you can sit on the riverbank and read your book in peace. The hotel is concealed by huge wooden doors, which open into a passageway and external atrium: once you are in the hotel you leave the bustle behind and enter the blissful tranquility of the hotel, which was beautifully and sensitively converted from an old real tennis court by the present owner's father. The previous reveiwer describes it perfectly: if only those ancient massive beams could talk, what a tale they would tell! The bedrooms are smallish but certainly not cramped, and have been recently upgraded and modernised: they are light and airy, the beds are extremely comfortable, and the rooms contain everything you could need. Choose a room on the first or second floor if you are inn the main part of the hotel: they will be quieter. The owner and staff are extremely accommodating: they will recommend and book restaurants for you, to suit your taste, and there is a big 'Paris guide book' section in the hotel's library just inside the salon to help you plan your stay. Nothing is too much trouble and when the rather restricted dining area inside the hotel was full when we came down for breakfast on the Saturday morning, they served our meal outside in the very pleasant, sheltered garden / yard area - very pleasant.

It is one of only a few hotels, all small scale, located on Ile St Louis, the small island in the Seine River next to Ile de la Cite, home to Notre Dame cathedral. It seems that an architect restored the centuries-old building, exposed all the original wooden beams, kept a great deal of the space of the building open, inserted an unobtrusive glass-walled elevator, a ground floor bar, a very comfortable outdoor sitting ( and smoking ) area on a patio near the massive street entrance doors, a breakfast area on the ground floor, and a sitting/reading area as a balcony inside the atrium of the building on the second floor. There are several rooms on the ground floor, with garden areas. The second and third floors each have a number of rooms, some of them - including the one we stayed in for three nights- overlooking the inner courtyard garden. A giant magnolia tree was outside our window. The room preserves the ancient wooden beams, but is in all other ways contemporary in design; with very comfortable bed, very good lighting, adequate closet space, and a very functional bathroom, with bath and shower, plus separate room with toilet. Robes, slippers and toiletries are supplied. With it's off-street location, the rooms are very quiet at night. Breakfast includes fresh orange juice, fresh bread and pastries. It is much more than adequate. Service staff are friendly, helpful, able to communicate in very adequate English, and eager to help arrange taxis, recommend local restaurants and advise about attractions in the area and cultural events in Paris. We followed their suggestions several times, and were glad we did. Ile St Louis is mainly a residential neighborhood; but one located in the heart of Paris. There are a large number of historically significant buildings that ring Ile St Louis, almost all of them having stone facades and wonderful views over the Seine. There are no large streets on the island, and it remains a community where people live for years and decades. The owner-architect of the Jeu de Paume Hotel deserves great praise for having restored a building worth saving, and for converting it into a wonderful small hotel.

Lovely sitting room areas downstairs which were nice to relax in. We felt the management were very friendly and welcoming and were more than happy to assist us whenever we sought it and make bookings for us at restaurants nearby. the hotel is in the most fabulous location right in the middle of Paris and I would definitely go back and stay here again, just even for the location.

I feel at home when I arrive at the Jeu de Paume. I've stayed there 3 times. Admittedly, I have a background in architecture, and design is important to me. The JDP is an amazing renovation of an historic building! The street entrance has one of those traditional blue-painted doorways and the main entrance is off the courtyard off the street, making it very private. The downstairs has a small front desk and is primarily a series of comforatable, distinctive sitting areas (where you can have a drink) and a breakfast area punctuated by a glass elevator which allows the user to view and appreciate the half-timber space. It feels like a series of mini living rooms that are shared by all the guests. There is an upstairs sitting area, too. So you don't have to stay in your typically small Paris hotel room all the time. Rooms are small and the reservation confirmations from the hotel all state this fact to level expectations. I've stayed in 3 different rooms and all had nicely redone baths with marble accents and robes. Bathtubs were standard American sized and deep. One bath had the toilet in a separate room. All rooms had fabric-covered walls with a little piece of artwork--nothing fancy. Rooms come with a small TV and minifridge that I use for snacks I get at the open air markets. Walls are thin yet no thinner than at other Paris hotels. Occasionally this is a problem if the neighbors are noisy, but it all depends on your neighbors. I always bring earplugs for travel anyway. I love the ability to watch CNN International and regular BBC, neither of which I get at home. A friend stayed in a room here and said the floor sloped. I never had that problem or at least I never noticed it. On my first stay there I could not get consecutive nights for the length of my stay, which I extended after arrival due to loving it so much, and the staff graciously called all the hotels in the area to get me a room for the one night the JDP could not accommodate me. Gotta love that! The staff has always been willing to make dinner reservations for me and recommend restaurants that locals go to. Through the staff I found an amazing seafood place that impressed my European friends multiple times. I usually have to depart early before breakfast service starts and the front desk person will make me a coffe to get me going. Upon returning to the hotel after a day of Paris I am always greeted with a \"bonjour mmle parisencore\". Those foil packages of shampoo that another reviewer mentioned are Annick Goutal Eau d'Hadrien shampoo and bubble bath. Yum! You don't get this quality of product except at top tier places like the Crillon. Visit the AG store; it's not cheap but the scents are wonderfully French. Part of what you pay for is location on the Ile St Louis. This is a quiet street that has a number of interesting shops and boutiques. You step out your door and it feels like Paris should feel. It's easy walking distance to the Marais and a healthy walk to the Latin Quarter. I've had decent meals at the restaurants down the street. I'm a big shopper and one of the best aspects of this location is the Pont Marie Metro Station. It's 2 minutes from the hotel and a short direct ride to the department stores (mo: Chaussee d'Antin) without having to change at the dreaded Chatelet! If you are carrying a lot of shopping bags you will appreciate this. It's also a direct route to the Louvre/Tuileries/Palais Royale (and A Priori The). The only real issue I have with the JDP is that the breakfast is overpriced, minimal, and has Viennoiserie rather than a lovely flakey French croissant. This is a shame as the breakfast area in the hotel is quite lovely and comfortable, and would be given justice with a fresh OJ, and egg or yogurt, a croissant, along with their nice strong coffee. I usually get fresh OJ at the market around the cornet and keep it in my minifridge. Now that the USD is so weak, all French hotels are expensive. I first stayed here when the dollar was stronger and the JDP was a bargain.

I can overlook a lot for location, and this is my favorite location in all of Paris. I may be in a rut, but this little island in the middle of the Siene calls to me. I just love it here. There are only 3 hotels (as far as I know) and they are all on the same street. I've stayed at 2 out of the 3. This was my first stay at this hotel. It's a little more upscale than the last one I stayed in. I had a very small single room, but it was spotlessly clean, really comfortable bed, bathroom fine, quiet and very pleasantly furnished/decorated. Nothing elaborate. A little pricey, but hey, it's the historic heart of Paris. It is literally strolling distance to Notre Dame, St. Chapelle, the L. Bank, the R. Bank - in the middle of everything. Tiny streets lined with great little shops, ice cream, bakery, bars, restaurants. You feel like a local when you stay here. Hotel has a great staff - very friendly and go out of their way to be helpful. Nice bar/lounge. Nice outdoor patio spaces. I actually was able to park my rental car in front of the hotel overnight (only stayed one night - was on way to Loire Valley) - a miracle since the street is so tiny. Parking is a nightmare in this area, and I was prepared to park the car in a public lot across the river after I dropped off my luggage - But Voila! There was this nice little spot right in front. Super! I would most definitely stay here again as long as the weather is good (not too hot). It is not air conditioned, and if you have to leave your windows open, you have zero privacy. It's quiet, but it is surrounded by other buildings very close. Zero privacy if your windows are open. Winter - no problem. I'm sure it is warm and cozy.
