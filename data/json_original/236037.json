The positives: -GREAT location: not only was it a short trip from the train station, (approx. 10 euro taxi fare), but the beautiful flower market was right across the street. It was an easy (and beautiful) walk along canals to the Anne Frank house, the Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh Museum, Dam and Red Light District. - Staff: Not there overnight but any time we had questions about where to go or good places to eat, they would have a suggestion or directions right away. Even booked a taxi to the station the day before that was ready and waiting when we came down. The negatives: - Furniture/fixtures: Our actual hotel room seemed worn. The guide we had said that the rooms featured furniture from the 30's and 40's and that is true. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like the furniture has received as much as a coat of varnish since then. - The noise: As every review states, the night club next door can be very loud. We were several rooms over from the room that shares a wall with the club but we could hear the thumping beats and people talking outside (even heard someone throwing up, could have been our neighbor in the next room though). Overall, I do get the feeling that ownership is attempting to improve the hotel. The bathrooms have been recently remodeled and were the best part of the room. The staff there is genuinely friendly and helpful, and the location just can't be more centrally located. Staying there isn't cheap, but it didn't strike me as outrageously expensive by European standards. Not bad if you are looking for (relatively) cheap lodging in a great location for walking.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cTerrible.

The reality was that first, after arranging for two canal view rooms months ago, they tried to to put me in the back overlooking an air shaft. The woman tried to say that I had only made a request for a canal view and they had none. I told her that I had it in writing that I was to have two canal rooms, then an attic room on the canal miraculously opened up. (FYI: the canal view was the only reason I selected the hotel, so it was a big deal.) The two young folks (18 and 25) with us took the attic room and let us have theirs, which was an actual canal side view room as promised (at least there was one). But it was the attic room that had the bed bugs. I never knew of anyone who had them and I have to admit that I have been skeptical when I see it written, thinking that people might be inventing it to trash the hotel. So that there is no doubt in anyones mind, I am posting two photos I took of her face and arm. She got bites on many parts of her body the first night, even though she was under the sheets. We so wanted to think they were mosquitoes, but the bites were redder and became hotter than mosquito bites, and they were in places that mosquitoes just would not have had access too. Further, her brother, usually prone to mosquito bites, sleeping in the next bed, had no bites. Then, after the first night, when she slept on top of the bed instead of inside the sheets and covers and/or in a another bed, she stopped getting bitten. But the bites continued to hurt her for several days. We informed the hotel, but since now I know there was a June review with the same problem, it looks like they do not take the problem seriously. Generally, the place is run very unprofessionally. When we arrived around 5:00, for example, there was a sign that we needed to go the restaurant in back. Generally, there is no one from the hotel there after 5:00. The attic room had a lot of mold and even some body hair in the shower. Our room was just dusty and the shower stall had considerable mildew built up in the tiles. I developed immediately bad sinuses due to the dirt and mold of the room and that stayed with me through the rest of the trip. The hall and breakfast room carpeting look like the worst condition I have ever seen. I saw the same loose pieces of stuff on the hall carpet steps everyday, indicating that they never vacuum them or at least it must be rarely. The SIngel Canal is the loudest canal, I believe, with parties going on late at night. There is no air-conditioning and it is too loud to sleep with the windows open and there are no screens. (This part I expected, but am just trying to be thorough.) The told us breakfast was served until 11:00, but on the last day (of a three night stay), the kids were told at 10:30 that the breakfast was closed. To summarize: it is not clean, not well run, and it has bed bugs. And, it is not even cheap. Do not stay here. I will note that there is one young man who is very helpful and helped us with making calls to deal with a stolen wallet (that did not happen there). But one personable desk attendant is insufficient to make a stay there a good experience.

Stayed again in July 2006. On this visit some disappointment about slightly rundown now and not being kept in best condition, as evidenced in other comments here, but on balance still liked it and still several positive points. Location of hotel good. Better hotels tend to be further out, while the ones right in the centre are generally inferior budget ones. Stayed in room 35. Small attic room on top floor, rather cramped, and many quite steep stairs to reach it; but adequately warned about these points on website and when booking. Double bed, window with no view, very little storage space, but definitely a room with appealing character. Walls need some paint. Own private bathroom across corridor, ie not ensuite; obviously recently refurbished, good size, high standard, very clean, plenty of hot water, shower quite good. Electronic safe in room, no extra charge, good. Key cards to control access to both hotel and room. Mosquitoes and a noisy unit outside (a/c or similar) a problem the first night (unusually hot weather), so kept window closed subsequent nights. Staff efficient, helpful and friendly. Breakfast typical Dutch continental of various breads, jam, cheese, cold meat, eggs, and a few other supplies. Good coffee and orange juice. Served as help yourself buffet, not a vast spread, but quite good and sufficient for us. Breakfast room peaceful and quite spacious, better than many hotels. A few items not fresh on second morning, assume left over from previous day, otherwise a good and relaxing breakfast. Some parts of hotel need attention. Graffiti on outside an unwelcome start. Stair carpet in poor condition, and distinct musty smell on lower stairs, as noticed by everyone else on this website. Repainting some walls would be a significant, and cheap, enhancement. Paid 92 Euros per night, which is reasonable for Amsterdam (although 88 Euros posted in room ?). Larger ensuite rooms around 120 Euros, 140 euros for view of canal. Booking dealt with efficiently by email, cancellation available up to 48 hours before arrival. In summary: Needs some refurbishment - new carpets and some paint, and ensure everything at breakfast is fresh. Otherwise, still an attractive hotel with character, good value, good location, a typical Amsterdam house rather than a bland hotel. (Other than spending a lot more money elsewhere) we would probably stay here again.

It is on the Singel Canal, within minutes of the Flower Market. My husband and I and our 13 year old had Room 32, a Triple facing the Canal. The outlook is lovely, specially at night, with the canal and street lit up. Being winter, we had the windows opened only a few inches for fresh air, so the noise of the nearby Trams did not bother us, but it could be different in summer. I think the ambience more than makes up for any background noise. The room had a double bed (two singles pushed together) and a single. The bathroom is a bit small for three, but recently renovated and everything is clean. Towels were changed everyday. There is a shower only. The room smelt strongly of smoke when we came in, but this is a problem I think one encounters everywhere in this city. We got some air freshener from the Management and left the windows open for a while and that helped. Breakfast, which was included, was good. Cereal, juice, beautiful breads, toast and spreads, hard boiled eggs, some typical Dutch sweet cookies/toast, tea/coffee. The breakfast room was obviously the living room of the previous owners and is furnished with some lovely Dutch pieces, very comfortable and relaxing. The Managers/Owners, Els and Yvo, and their staff, all speak English, are friendly and extremely helpful with suggestions and directions. They called a Taxi to take us to Central Station on our departure and it arrived in a matter of minutes. The only drawback of the Agora is the steep, narrow stairs to the upper levels. We had to drag three big suitcases to our room and it was not easy. All Canal house hotels must have this problem, but be forewarned if you cannot manage steps. There are many good restaurants within a short walk of the Hotel. we tried an Indonesian restaurant, that does \"Rijstaffel\", it was excellent. All the sights are reached by a short tram ride or a brisk walk. The biggest problem we encountered in Amsterdam was the amount of smokers in restaurants. There are few designated \"non smoking\" areas and some of these are in very close proximity to the smoking section. Ask, before you sit down, if this is as much of a bother to you, as it was to us. Amsterdam can be very cloudy and windy. A good head scarf is invaluable, besides all the other cold weather gear.
