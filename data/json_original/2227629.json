The location was great and the d\u00e9cor fantastic; very clean and contemporary! There was a lot of room compared to a hotel room at a similar price. We felt like we \u201clived\u201d in Barcelona. The only thing missing was a regular oven, but otherwise the kitchen was fully stocked. The \u201cLes Corts\u201d Metro Stop on the Metro Barcelona Green Line is very handy. We took a bus from the airport to \u201cEspanya\u201d and then rode the Green Line north from there. We were shocked that Les Corts stop was right outside our window! It can\u2019t get any easier. We didn\u2019t have to figure out a map and the Les Corts area is nice: many businesses are just to the north on Diagonal Avenue. There are also very close grocery stores. The Consum is just around the corner. The staff were available 24/7 which was reassuring should we have any troubles. We would strongly recommend these Apartments to others and would stay there again.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Zagreb, Croatia", "Title": "\u201cDecent stay in clean and modern apartments near Camp Nou\u201d", "Author": "TomoB", "ReviewID": "UR127323339", "Content": "Apartments are situated just in front of Les Corts metro station, which is on the same green line that can lead you to Placa Espanya or Catalunya in minutes. Location is especially good for football fans because FC Barcelon's stadium Camp Nou is just 10 minutes walk from hotel. Apartments are pretty big and modern. I had a room terrace and both living room and one bedroom has glass wall towards terrace. Kitchen is very well equipped and you can buy groceries in Consum, supermarket just around the corner. There is a lot of small restaurants and cafes in diameter 100 meters from hotel. On the roof there is small pool but it is working from April 1. Stuff working here could be friendlier - they give the information you need, but you have a feeling you are interrupting them in doing something more important. Regarding noise some travelers mentioned, it is present because apartments are facing main street which is very busy. Also there is children playground and few restaurants in front of hotel which also influence noise level. Regarding mentioned there is some noise but it didn't stopped me of having a good sleep.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Managua", "Title": "\u201cA great apartment in a great location\u201d", "Author": "Frederick_Jimenez", "ReviewID": "UR127019481", "Content": "I stayed here from March 25th to March 29th. I was attending Alimentaria trade show. And this place was excellent, comfortable, clean, in a safe neighborhood, lots of restaurants nearby, \"Les Corts\" metro stop practically in front of the hotel. And for the soccer fans the Barcelona Camp Nou soccer field is only a 10min walk away. The 2 only negative aspects I can mention are: - check in is at 5pm. I arrived there at 2pm after an intercontinental flight, I was expecting to take a shower and get some rest, but I had to wait, at least I got to explore the neighborhood while I waited. - They don't clean your apartment unless you stay for more than 6 nights. If you stay less you have to clean it yourself. If not they charge you \u20ac55. I didn't pay anything during my checkout.

We were happy until the night. So noisy!!!!!! The noise (moving furniture noise) continued until 2am. Because they have a bar on ground floor. The hotel is very poor sound proof. Our room was on 1st floor. That was noisiest room we have ever had! We travel all over the world. So, we are not fussy travellers. If you are night going out person or booking top floor(5th) this hotel is superb.
