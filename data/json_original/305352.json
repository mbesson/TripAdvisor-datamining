However, we always book a hotel for one night before we move in to our place. One year while we were on a vaporetto going down the Grand Canal, we noticed the Foscari Palace across from the fish market. My wife said,\"I bet that would be a great place to stay\", so the next year I booked a room for a night. Because of a one day vaporetto strike the next year, we had to walk from the north end of the island to the hotel. Seeing how spent we looked as we walked in the door of the Foscari, the manager brought us two refreshing cool glasses of ACE juice. Right away, I knew this place would not disappoint. Our room was something out of a fairy-tale. We had second floor corner room that had two windows; one looking directly across from the fish market, the other overlooking a small canal. Our room had a large bed, beautiful drapes, a Venetian chandelier, as well as a fireplace; a place that even Desdemona & Othello would find comfortable. On the other hand, the bathroom was a modern as it could be; a large marble tub as well as a shower that had so many heads that you didn't have to turn around to get wet. After we settled in, we took a wondeful stroll down the Strada Nova which is just around the corner from the Foscari. That evening, we returned to the hotel & had drinks on the roof. What a view! The next morning, we came down to a breakfast that would make a cruise ship proud.

We requested a Canal View ( deluxe superior) room and were not disappointed with our view from the top floor corner. At $606 CAD per night we knew we were in expensive Venice! Compared to other 3-4 Star hotels we were were not being over-charged in our opinion. I suspect the side view rooms would be less appealing. We had a superb high-ceilinged room which was clean, airy and with a huge comfortable bed. The bathroom was marbled, well-appointed with a high tech shower that took a while to figure out. Despite the price a few minor things did not work, although we did report them (the tub jacuzzi, a small bathroom light) Breakfast was in an elegant although somewhat crowded room with generous choices of wonderful cold foods. The hot foods were a bit tired, but overall breakfasts were very satisfying. We appreciated the non-smoking policies. The Foscari Palace is next to a traghetto stop from which, during the day, you can cross to the vegetable and fish markets. The Ca d'Oro vaporetto stop is adjacent and the hotel is on the Campo Santa Sophia which adjoins a wonderful walking thoroughfare extending from Santa Lucia train station to St. Mark's Square (Sestiere Cannaregio). This hotel combines convenience for location with comfort. It was pleasant to return to after a long day of tourist travel.There do not appear to be many surrounding good restaurants although the Grom Gelato chain was very close!

First, the drinking cups were plastic-wrapped plastic cups. Can the guests not be trusted with glass? Second, the shampoo in the bathroom was in cheap throwaway pouches that were impossible to open. Impossible. Third, and most disgustingly, the hotel had clearly invested in fancy \"spa\" shower/tub combinations. This thing had more outputs for water than I could count. It was impossible to figure out how to operate. The jets in the tub didn't work. And everywhere in this thing where it was possible for mold to grow, it was growing.

As this trip was dedicated to their 35th Wedding Anniversary we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been searching a lot prior to making final decision. Being to Venice several times before and taking into account that it was my parents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 very first trip to this magnificent city I decided to find smth special and preferably situated on Grand Canal. We chose Foscari Palace for its fantastic location right on the Grand Canal close to Rialto bridge (less than 5 min walking distance) and within 10-15 min of walking to San Marco square in one direction but also the same distance to Piazzale Roma in another \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so the hotel location is perfect as you can reach all parts of Venice easily by foot. On the other hand if you are not keen on walking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the vaporetto station Ca D\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Oro is only one block (or 2 min walk) away from hotel and the Traghetto station (to cross the Grand Canal on gondola for only 0.5 EUR) is situated right in front of hotel entrance on Campo St. Sophia. With traghetto you will be able to reach famous Rialto Food and Fish market (which situated on the other bank of Grand Canal right in front of the hotel), only in 2-3 minutes. So taking into account such perfect location and also very good reviews of the property on Tripadvisor we finally booked their wonderful Junior Suite with Grand Canal view (Gonzaga suite) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c situated on the 2nd floor with high ceilings and 2 balconies facing Grand Canal. In the meantime I decided to make very special surprise for my parents and 1 week prior to the arrival without informing them I e-mailed the hotel explaining the situation and the specialty of trip (35th Wedding Anniversary) and asked hotel team for the possibility of free room upgrade to their one and only gorgeous Foscari Suite. To their credit hotel representative \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Mrs. Divna answered very fast and informed me that hotel would be more than happy to offer this free upgrade and bottle of Prosecco for my parents for such special occasion \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I would like once again to sincerely thank hotel team for such generous present and their fantastic attitude \u00e2\u20ac\u201c well done!!! So upon arrival my parents were escorted to their room and what was their amazement when they found that instead of Junior Suite (which is really very good) they will stay in Grand Foscari Suite \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this apartment is something special and worth separate mentioning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c situated on the 1st floor of the hotel, with high original beamed ceilings, marble floors, consists of huge (40m2) bedroom with fireplace, Murano glass chandelier and 2 balconies facing Campo St. Sophia and side view of Grand Canal plus gorgeous living room (almost the same size) with 6 big two-leaf windows facing directly Grand Canal (in fact if you look at the picture of hotel front \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 6 out of 7 windows on the first floor facing Grand Canal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all belong to Foscari Suite) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c WOW what a view! The bathroom features bathtub with Jacuzzi and all amenities you would expect from 4 star luxury hotel, there are 2 big LCD screens in both rooms with good variety of programs, bathrobe and sleepers which were changed EVERY day conclude the overview of this fantastic apartment. The breakfast was very good \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with wide variety of high quality products to choose from. The hotel itself is immaculate clean and the service is top spot. The rooftop terrace on the last floor has unbeatable views on the Grand Canal as well as general Venice panorame. In the evening on the first day parents was greeted with bottle of Prosecco \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was also unexpected and so even more pleasant touch for them. All hotel staff did their best to make their stay memorable and they really succeeded in this, as my parents said that they felt like at home away from home and that it was probably one of the most memorable stays in their lives. When the last day of their stay came they really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to leave and thus waiting for return in this fantastic property in the heartbeat and would definitely recommend this hotel to everybody who would like to spend an unforgettable time in the heart of one of the most charming cities in the world.", "Date": "February 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix", "Title": "\u201cLate review- This hotel will knock your socks off\u201d", "Author": "Escapefromthedesert", "ReviewID": "UR88578875", "Content": "Sorry, I am writing a late review, I stayed Nov 3-5 2009 prior to a Mediterrean cruise.

Venice should be and in some cases can only be walked. The lobby is grand. The hotel desk clerk was brisk and almost cold when checking-in. I think it was the language gap as English was not her first language. Once we got to the room I was impressed, the bedroom was separate from the sitting area. The bed was comfortable and very clean. We had a room that had an inner court view which was a view of the wall of the next building. I could have upgraded to a room with a canal view, but decided to keep the savings as we were only in the room at night. The hotel overall including the stairwells are charming with all the history from the Duke's prior palace. They did not have a work-out room ,which I expected from a boutique property. Breakfast was an ample European buffet with meats, chesse, fruits and breads. Both days they were late in their set-up as we are early risers and that staff seemed irrated.

Although there were a few that were questionable, I chose to go with the masses. What a mistake! Their customer service has A LOT TO BE DESIRED!!!!! I recently stayed in 6 hotels since September while touring Europe and made a decision to review all hotels upon my return to the USA. But at this moment, I am writing from my hotel room in GREAT DISGUST! It all started on Tuesday, the actual day a friend and I checked in. The hotel room did not have two washcloths even though two guests were on the itinerary. It took 1.5 hours for me to receive another washcloth. I called the reception desk after 11pm to request it via the phone. I began working on the computer when I realized an hour had passed. I called back in which the night auditor expressed to me that he did not speak English. No problem. I communicated to him my request in Italian after using Google translator. But, why didn't he just say this in the first place. Second, on Wednesday morning, I asked the receptionist, Divna who was not busy if she could show me on the map where a few tourists sites were that I researched myself. When I asked her where something was, she told me that she did not know. Not a problem. However, she was complacent with this answer even though she was sitting in front of the computer! So I said, \"Can you Google it? It will only take a few seconds if that.\" Within seconds, my question was resolved upon my prompting. Thursday at 12pm, my door bell rang. I was just about to answer it; however, the cleaning lady began to enter in which she apologized. I requested that she come back in which she replied, \"ok.\" 1 second later, the room phone rang. It was the same receptionist, Divna stating that the receptionist is leaving and she will not have anyone to clean the room. I requested that she gives me 15 mins. so that I could finish up and that the room will be all hers. She told me that it was not possible and if there was anything that we needed in terms of towels. I got dressed and approached the front desk at 12:14pm. I stated, \"I would like to speak with you when you have a moment.\" Divna told me that it was fine. I could speak to her now. As I began to speak with her, she was writing and looking up every now and then as if my concern was not important to her. I stated, \"I'm a bit confused because we were trying to leave the room and you are telling me that we can not receive cleaning service.\" Divna stated that the cleaning lady gets off at 12pm and that there was nothing she could do. I stated to Divna if the woman is off of work at 12pm, why would she just open our door to provide cleaning at 12pm. It doesn't make sense. She tells me that if she sends the woman up to my room to clean, she will not be paid for it. Then she begins to dismiss me and state I came down to argue with her? Excuse me????? I am simply trying to understand why my room can not get cleaned and furthermore who does not give a guest their undivided attention. Then other guests approached in the lobby and she began to get louder as I am quiet staring at her that I want to argue with her. I simply looked at her and stated that is not the case. Why would I argue when I only want to understand and that this is a GREAT misstatement. As I began to look at her as well as the other guests, she conceded and told a lady in Italian to go upstairs to clean my room. However, it was not without attitude and FRANK RUDENESS!!!!!! Thursday evening, it began to rain heavily. I enter the hotel at 10pm on the dot and was completely drenched. My socks, shoes, coat, etc. were all wet. I requested a cup of hot chocolate and was told that the bar closes at 10pm. I said, \"It's 10pm right now. Can you please assist me?\" Sarah told me that she would let her colleague know and call upstairs. Then she informs me that my friend called 10 minutes prior and ordered the same exact thing. We share a laugh. 10-15 minutes passes by in which I am told it is not feasible as the bar was closed. I know this already as we discussed it prior to me getting on the elevator at 10:03pm. Why even tell me that you are going to call upstairs if you had no intention of even fulfilling my request. She then told my friend that I could go outside. GREAT! Outside in the pouring rain after 10:30pm for hot chocolate when I am already soaking wet!!! Does that really make sense???? For hot chocolate???? She did not even care and explained that she did not have a key to the bar and/or kitchen to even fix me a cup of hot chocolate even though her and her colleagues congregate in the area to eat and drink themselves. Things that make you go, \"Hmmmmm....\" So I decided to get myself ready as we have an early check-out. I go into the bathroom and guess what? There are NOT 2 washcloths again! My friend goes down to the front desk to request one in which Sarah says, the cleaning lady did not leave you 2? No, she just came all the way downstairs to ask for an extra one for no reason. She then tells the night auditor in Italian and he comes back with a napkin. Are you serious? She tells him no and he comes back with a hand towel stating that is all they have. How can that be when the same thing happened on Tuesday night? There is not one washcloth in the entire hotel. I truly find that hard to believe. I am UTTERLY disgusted with my experience and because of the staff, it has made my stay in Venice bittersweet! I would NEVER EVER EVER stay in this hotel again or any property owned by the same management especially if this is how their staff attends to and/or treats its guests.

The first time I stayed in room 306. It was a huge room with big bathroom and great view of the canal. Beautiful decor, perfect location. Good breakfast and we loved sitting on the roof top patio in the morning just relaxing and watching all the action below. But...... we had no hot water in our room so couldnt shower. After speaking to the front desk they said the hotel had run out of hot water although the hotel didnt seem that full and they should have enough for all guests to shower the next day. The second time (a week later) my sister stayed in room 306 and I was in 203. She again loved the room but we were surprised to find out AGAIN there was no hot water. The staff said they would send someone up to fix it but they never did. I think it just doesnt work in that room. This time I had hot water in my room and even filled up the tub to take a jet bath. (It is amazing this place has jet tubs in beautiful bathrooms). The problem was the tub was not cleaned properly. There was hair from the previous guests and the jets did not work. I decided to shower instead but the shower head was broken and only drizzed out water. I decided that wasnt a big deal because the room was so comfortable so just went to sleep rather than bathing. Had a great sleep but was awaken early the next morning by construction from the opposite wall. The neighbors were jack hammering the wall opposite from my head at 7:30 AM! I called the front desk and they said it wasnt their construction but the neighbors. I felt that if they knew the neighbors were doing construction they should not put guests in that room or work out a deal that construction started after check out. I live in Milan and take guests to Venice regularly. I may give this place a 3rd times a charm try only if I got a great deal on it again.

As we're traveling around the world we've been using it for taking food with us on planes and to use in the hotel room. The front desk did not really seem to care about this and we could not find the maids to ask them since we were leaving early the next morning. The other is not their fault, but it seems the piazza they are in is VERY noisy after 11pm, every night there would be loud music playing, people screaming and the sounds of drunk people. It was quiet up until then and we'd go to bed only to be woken up by really loud noises which would go on past midnight.

The hotel's website didn't really do much to sell the place, but we booked it on the basis of availability and reviews on Trip Adviser. We were not disappointed. Forget those hidous sofa chairs you see all over the place on the website - the Foscari Palace is so much more elegant than that. We arrived by water taxi from the airport (the cheapest place to park if you are driving), and came directly to the hotel. It was a wonderful arrival. The staff were welcoming, efficient and knowledgeable. Our room had high ceilings, was spotless, and was tastefully decorated. Not a crimpeline covered sofa chair or needless piece of bling to be seen. The mini bar was wonderfully stocked and not ridiculously priced. The highlight however was the view from our room, which was absolutely stunning - direct onto the Grand Canal. We paid slightly extra to secure the superior double room overlooking the Canal, and it was well worth it. It was stunning. The bathroom was equipped with a jacuzzi bath with multiple direction spray in the shower - much too complicated for we simpletons, but appreciated nevertheless. Room service came twice a day, and we were always stocked up with lots of clean towels. The breakfast was very good, with something for everyone. I liked the fact that the staff were present when we were there, as we could always ask them for things that we needed. (Unlike other hotels with five stars where we have had to go looking for them!) Much has been written in other reviews about the location of the Hotel, and they are all spot on. The Foscari Palace is in an excellent location, and it offers exceptional value for money and a level of service which belies its four star status. It is a gem. As a general tip for Venice, we used the 'Time Out' guide to Venice and Verona, and used it for recommendations for everything from sight seeing to restaurants. It was invaluable. Look out for the famous and highly rated 'Alla Vedoca' bacari (winebar/restaurant) located not five minutes from the Foscari Palace - you must book a table in advance for the evenings, and you will see why. THE best meatballs in Venice, and very tasty pasta. The atmosphere is fantastic. Deservedly famous, so 'Time Out' says, and indeed it is. The other main benefit is that you only need to walk five minutes to be back at the hotel!

We ate at the 'a la Vecia Cavana' resturant, a card given to us in the hotel, however I would not recommend this resturant, it was very expensive and we did not find the staff at all friendly. For our lunch the next day we went back to the first riverside resturant (but they are all good) by the Rialto bridge (we had eaten here often on our previous visit) and had the most amazing lunch with excellent wine and really nice waiters, all you need to do is keep smiling, try a few words in Italian and they will serve you very well, all afternoon, and what a view!

Its a very beautiful hotel that has to be said is in a really great location for exploring venice, close to all the sights yet not right in the thick of it. The water bus stop is 2 mins walk away and the tronchetto (?spelling) crossing stops right outside the hotel door to so you dont need to walk down to Riatlo to cross the river. The Foscari Palace deserves to be well rated on trip advisor as it does exactly what it needs to provide a good standard of accommodation in the right place, its an excellent 4 star hotel but it didn't blow me away for the price (but then venice is expensive on the whole, the euro rate doesnt help) so i wont use words like exceptional or amazing to describe it. The staff overall were good, one man in particular who served us drinks was very friendly but i found it hit and miss with some of the staff on the reception rota, they could be a little sullen and getting any good quality information in relation to your questions proved a little difficult, language being quite a barrier with some. From start to finish however we never had any problems with the hotel. Check in was very quick and hassle free despite not checking in till 10 at night. Our room 304 was very good and better then i thought having only booked a superior double. Rooms have ample space, large wardrobes with real coat hangers (unlike most places now), defiantly one of the better equipped hotels i have stayed at, mini bar, flat screen tv etc. We also had a little balcony with side grand canal view which even though i knew we would have a partial view never thought we would have a balcony. The bathroom was very well equipped i have never seen so much personalized toiletries (its didnt stop there everything had a foscari palace stamp on it, stay here and you will see what i mean) its certainly funny, there is even a built in radio (1 station) in the bathroom. The bed was comfy however we only had 1 pillow on each side of the bed and 1 spare which i found uncomfortable as we both sleep with 2 pillows each. Breakfast spread was very varied plenty of continental choice, perhaps one of the best breakfast spreads i have seen in any hotel in europe. There was a selection of hot food in buffet style heated servers but im not keen on eating from them id rather it was cooked fresh, by partner partook in some hot food which he found to be fine but it all just looked rubbery to me. An interesting note which i wasn't expecting is there are alot and i mean alot of bell towers in venice of which 3 are in close enough proximity to the hotel to wake you up in the morning as they rung, i suppose it woke me up the 1st day as i wasn't expecting it but i soon got used to them. There are some lovely sitting areas downstairs in reception and a small bar, the best part as im sure anyone reading this has seen enough pictures of and one of the main reasons we booked this hotel is the roof terrace, the view is stunning and it makes for such a relaxing place to sit. We ordered our drinks downstairs at the bar and he delivered them up to us (which i felt very guilty about), by the looks of it there is a small bar upstairs which i think they must open when it is busy in the height of summer im not sure. A views notes about venice,restaurants,experiences. Venice was stunning, i have never been before so didnt really know what to expect, its something out of a picture book. We got to the hotel very easily number 5 bus from the airport (included in the vaperetto pass, defiantly buy one of these for the duration of your stay) then from piazzo roma took the water bus number 1 to ca d'oro then its a walk down the alley at the water bus stop turn right then 1st right and theres the hotel easy!!! The water bus system is so easy to use and it gets you everywhere. We did all the main sights st mark square (including the most ridiculous priced cafes in the square you have ever some across but it has to be done you live once!), Gondola trip, Harrys Bar, Murano island, Grand canal boat tour, Walking tour and trip out of venice to the hill towns both with Aventure Bellissime (great tour company to use, really happy with there service). Take a trip across to the market opposite the hotel its such an experience seeing all the fresh fish and vegetables. Restaurant wise despite being in venice for 3 nights we truly only had 2 as we arrived late the 1st night, both nights we ate close to the hotel Casa Mia - great food, very simple restaurant, lots of locals and very cheap. Its just behind the hotel but i cant give instructions as to where, as we walked round in circles to find it despite how close it was. Al Fontego del Pescaori - probably the best fish restaurant i have ever been to, a little pricey but what a place, if you turn left onto the main street behind the hotel then take the right down the alleyway before the next bridge you arrive at it about 25 meters later on the left handside, its got metal gates at the entrance and only a small wooden sign with the name on it, booking is advisable.

Later in the day the you can watch the canal give itself over to the visitors when the gondolas, water taxis and water buses are the main canal users. Many of the famous Venitian sights are within comfortable walking distance of the Foscari Palace and there is a Traghetto (a gondola converted to carry passengers cheaply across the canal), situated right outside the hotel's main entrance so you can visit other places of interest without having to use one of the Grand Canal bridges, the Rialto being the nearest. This hotel was definitely part of the Venice experience.", "Date": "September 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cAn oasis of calm\u201d", "Author": "Folrida_bound", "ReviewID": "UR19458684", "Content": "We stayed here for four nights to celebrate my wife's birthday.

The hotel was within easy walking of some excellent restaurants. Out of the Hotel to the end of the street and right, takes you to the Strada Nova where you will find Trattoria Da Gianni - it looks just like you would expect an Italian restaurant to look and the food is very good and reasonably priced. However, our favourite place was south on the Strada Nova, turn left at the end and first left into a narrow alley called 'C d Oca'. There you will find Trattoria Casa Mia, which looks a little basic but is in fact used by local Venecians, which simply adds to the charm and character of the restaurant. The food is absolutely fabulous, as is the local wine and to top it off, it is very reasonably priced. We had tried other restaurants closer to the more touristy parts of Venice but the rule seemed to be that the closer you got to Piazza San Marco, the worse the food got and the the higher the prices got. Overall, the Foscari Palace is perfectly placed for transport around Venice; for walking to the main tourist sites; for good local restaurants; and for attentive and welcoming staff, with a high standard of comfort and convenience within the hotel.

Staying at a place directly on the canal is definitely a big plus. We did not have to drag our suitcases up and down those (in)famous Venice bridges, as we saw many many other people had to do. Having prepared myself for small cramped rooms in a place like Venice, the size of these rooms were truly a pleasant surprise. Both of them comfortably accommodated an extra rollaway bed. Bathrooms were also large and well furnished. I loved the overall cozy feel of the hotel, probably because of its relatively small size. It felt like staying at a nice (and wealthy) friend's home.

I pre-planned that we would take a (expensive) water taxi straight to the hotel's dock on the Grand Canal. It was worth it to us for our first (and short) visit to Venice. We found great service from the hotel staff, both before and after our trip. The room, a deluxe double room looking over the Grand Canal (another splurge) was absolutely beautiful and very big. The breakfast buffet was the best we had among the 5 places we stayed in Italy. While the location isn't in the most popular San Marco sestiere, it was a pretty short and pleasant walk to San Marco Square and even over to the Accademia and Peggy Guggenheim museum. While you can probably find equal quality hotels closer to those areas, they're likely a lot more expensive. For us, this tradeoff was perfect. Wandering the streets of Venice is one of the more enjoyable activities anyway. If we were to stay longer in Venice then I'd have to consider a smaller hotel or B&B (at least based on today's exchange rate). But if you have only a short time in Venice, I'd recommend this route. And of all the places to splurge, I think this is a good one. The hotel quoted us 60 Euro for a water taxi between there and the train station. That's what they arranged for us on the way out of town (back to the train station).

As a result, you get a real reisidential neighborhood feel with lots of ordinary Venetians living their daily lives. The Ca d'Oro vaparetto stop is just a block or so away. . Also, the roof terrace has a spectacular view of the Grand Canal and is an utterly delightful place to read a book or have a drink while watching the endless activity on the canal. Based on photos and stolen glimpses, the more expensive rooms looked very comfy. But the standard room we booked -- the hotel's euphemism is \"classic\" -- was probably the most cramped room we had ever had in a four-star hotel. The only seating that would fit was a single straight-backed chair. At about 240 euros a night, the room didn't strike us as a great value, even considering that Venice is costly. The classic rooms tend to overlook a street that is literally about seven feet wide, so the view is a likely to be a blank wall. However, our room was quiet, and on the second floor at least, there was enough light. The bed was quite large. The mattress was considerably firmer than average, which could be a problem if you like a plush feel. The bathroom was fine, though the shower arrangement was a bit cramped. The breakfast, included in the price, was satisfactory and we never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for a table.

Other than the two or three hotels closer to the train station with Grand Canal views (slightly cheaper rooms but with less than shinny reviews), this hotel at the Ca d'Oro stop represents real value for your money. It is certainly not cheap, but the hotel represents good value. Something similiar to our Gonzaga Junior Suite (Room 209) say at the Hotel Gritti Palace and Hotel Bauer Il Palazzo costs about 1,000-1,200 euros! And guess what, we only paid 429 euros, and this is the peak Easter weekend rate! Though the actual room had appeared smaller than the website pictures, we were more than pleased - two frontal Grand Canal balconies, easy to find location, lilies in room, marble everywhere, huge and bright bathroom with showers and tub, Saturday Night free cocktail and harp performance (remember to tip the lady as we did!). Practically everything in the room appears and smells new, and very functional, too. Surprisingly, the common areas are a stunner too, with wrought iron gates, plush carpets, Murano glass lamps and a rather huge lobby waiting area. Of course, do not forget to visit its roof top Altana terrace, for some cocktail and great aerial views of Venice. As for breakfasts, there was a good variety of hot and cold foods, including something rarely seen at Italian hotels - my beloved stir fried Mushrooms! So yummy I must say ... Our glitches were minor and it did not affect our otherwise wonderful stay - 1. there were no slippers in the suite and the marbled floors could be quite cold during the winter months 2. the 2pm check in and 11am check out times were strictly enforced, with no room for negotiations... 3. that there was no tea/coffee making facilities in the room 4. being a Frontal Grand Canal view room comes with a small price - noise of the gondolas knocking against each other or against the wooden poles. To put it in a nutshell, we really enjoyed our stay there. In addition to the Hotel Londra Palace, this is yet another Venetian hotel we wouldn't mind returning to. The Hotel Ca Sagredo, which we visited in Dec 2007 (just across the Hotel Foscari Palace) was good as well with its Grand Palatial feel to it but the Foscari Palace was a cosier boutique styled hotel and seems to be better maintained.", "Date": "April 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cLoved It!\u201d", "Author": "SanDiegoGeorge", "ReviewID": "UR14746851", "Content": "We stayed at the Foscari Palace for three days and nights in early March, 08 and loved it.

We were originally in superior double over the front door of the hotel. It was spacious and pleasantly furnished, however the television did not work. The receptionist (very hostile) sent a guy to look at it. When he coud not fix it we were 'upgraded'. We were given a junior suite room 301. Thank goodness I did not pay extra for it. It had a small sitting area and a bedroom that was much smaller than our first room. Patio doors led to a small terrace with a table and four chairs but as the temparature was at 2 degrees we did not have much use for it. The view from the room was the wall of a building about 3 metres away. Breakfast was ok - quite basic and no toast, The room was far too small and you could overhear other conversations. The bar area also lacked atmosphere. On leaving the hotel another rude receptionist (both were male) told us our total without showing us the breakdown of the bill. Once we had paid, he turned toi his computer and began typing without so much as a thank you and goodbye, really quite bad customer service we felt. Perhaps I expected too much!

It was definitely on ours - and now its been ticked off. We discovered the Foscari Palace hotel via Trip Advisor. We read all the reviews and then ignored the one or two poor ones as being atypical. We booked via the Giannetti Hotels Group website and then corresponded directly with the hotel via email. This was all straight forward and we only had to pay one nights deposit up front. Arrived after dark on a cold winters afternoon so took a water taxi direct from the airport to the hotel (Euro 90). If we went back we would probably use the water bus (Euro 14 each) as the Ca D'or bus stop is only about 1 minute walk from the hotel and in retrospect is quite easy to find. The Foscari Palace hotel was beautiful. Staff were very helpful, even though our Italian is virtually non existant. We had booked a canal view and were given Room 201 - a corner room with two windows and a minuscule balcony. The canal view added significantly to the cost of the room but what is the point of going to Venice and not having one? It was all as expected - stunning! The bed was simply huge (being two 4ft singles put together as is typical). The minibar was suprisingly normally priced - comparable to most London hotels anyway. The Bathroom was clean and bright. The shower was overly complex but fun (Still cannot work out what one of the attachments was for). Breakfast was excellent especially considering that it is included in the price. Location of the hotel was ideal - Nothing was too far to walk to (and I am not known for being a keen walker). I would particulaly recomend the nearby restaurant - \"Hosteria Al Vecio Bragosso\" - about 1 minute from the hotel. Food here was the best we had over 4 days of consistantly good food, although it was not the cheapest. It was Very Cold whilst we were there - Take a warm coat if you are not going in Summer. I think that 3 days was long enough to see all that we wanted to see and the overall cost of being in Venice makes it unlikely that we will return. However, as I said at the begining, it had to be done. Overall, I would heartiy recommend Venice, and in particular the Foscari Palace. We had a great time (if a bit cold).

We stayed two nights (2-4 Feb 2008). The breakfast was pretty good and included in the price. We paid EUR598.40 for a triple room for the two nights so it was pretty extravagant and a bit out of our usual price range. On our arrival they told us there would be a little \"party\" in reception from 6.30pm. This turned out to be a lovely recital by a beautiful lady playing the harp. There was also some complimentary drinks and finger food on offer. It was good fun watching our fellow guests, kitted out in costume for Carnevale, appear for a drink then disappear into the night. This was my fourth visit to Venice and I must say to come during Carnevale is marvelous fun and definitely worthwhile. I picked the Foscari Palace as I wanted to be sure that we had a great time and that my 7yo daughter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first trip to Venice would be a memorable one and Trip Advisor had heaps of great reviews on the Foscari Palace. Carnevale was something I had always wanted to experience but coming from Australia I never thought I would have the opportunity to actually be there for it (as what Australian in their right mind would come to Europe for winter!!) however finding ourselves now living just up the road (in Brussels) and having recently become hooked on skiing we just happened to be in Austria in the week of Carnevale and Venice seemed so close Austria (it was about a four hour drive from Filzmoos where we had been skiing). We parked at the Tronchetto Parking Garage which at EUR20 a night is a fair bit cheaper than Amsterdam and Paris so seemed like good value to us. The only downside from the whole experience was the little wooden garden shed like structure at the end of Campo S. Sofia which sold cheap alcohol which seemed to include a lot of red bull and from out of this little wooden shed they blasted out very loud music until all hours on the Saturday night. Having only recently retired from the nightclub scene I had never considered myself to be an old fogey but when you are so tired that your body aches, you are located a good 50 meters away in what was for us a very expensive hotel and in a divinely comfortable bed but just can't sleep thanks to loud music well quite frankly I am now an old fogey and the music was just way too loud. On the Sunday morning we asked the reception staff if it was likely to happen again on the Sunday night and when they said it would we asked if there was anything that could be done (i.e. could they ask that the music be turned down/call the police/pull the plug on the stereo) as we actually found it difficult to sleep on the Saturday night as the music was so loud but they said there was nothing that could be done... the saving grace was that the little wooden shed didn't stay open quite so late on the Sunday night. In all it seemed unnecessary to have the music so loud in an outdoor setting and out of character for a place like Venice. There were a few other such tents and sheds blasting out the loud music and selling the cheap alcohol spotted around town but surely that only takes business away from the regular bars around Venice?", "Date": "February 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cTip for a Good-Sized Double Room\u201d", "Author": "us-uk", "ReviewID": "UR13018720", "Content": "I stayed here in a double (Room 103), while my other friends stayed in Rooms 104 & 102.

The receptionists are a bit up themselves, but asked for a recommendation for dinner they duly sent us somewhere where we had a wonderful meal. The chambermaid was lovely and nothing was too much trouble for her. The breakfast is excellent, but the hotel tries to up its (otherwise reasonable) charges with extras. So you pay for the tea and coffee in your room and you can't even take an apple out of breakfast. Not cool. However, if you go out of the hotel, walk the 20 yards to the Strada Nuovo and look diagonally left you will see a bakery. Their stuff is delicious (try the S shaped biscuits) and the fruit jellies (no gelatine and no artificial flavours) will make you wonder why you ever bought a packet of fruit pastilles. As other reviewers point out it is also brilliantly placed. We wanted to be near the synagogue in the ghetto and to be 8 minutes from there and 8 minutes from the Rialto was pretty good going.

I had chosen the property based on the reviews here and it was an excellent choice. The hotel is quite charming and immaculately clean. We booked the Deluxe with view of the Grand Canal and were assigned to #201. I had seen pictures of the room here, but they didn't capture really how large the room was. It was very spacious with high ceilings. The bed was two pushed together as one forming one large king sized bed. I felt a little firm upon first sitting but it proved to be very comfortable and gave me two nights of sound sleeping. There is natural light into the room from two long windows, one of which opened up onto a small balcony overlooking the Canal. Not big enough to sit out on, but nice to stand out on and admire the views. Although the Grand Canal is busy and noisy, when the windows were shut they were very insulated, so noise was not a problem. One note though. They are doing a large renovation project on the building next door. This room abutts all of that. If you are there on a weekday they will be woking there all day. Thankfully the room had enough insulation that we could only hear noise from the renovations when we were in the bathroom. One day though they were ripping up old wooden pylons out front of the hotel and that noise we could not escape from. Since we were on our way out for the day it wasn't an issue. The bathroom was also huge with a two sink vanity, bidet, heated towel racks, bathrobes, and a massively overcomplicated shower/jacuzzi tub set-up. While it's great to have modern equipment, there were just way too many jets and shower head options and was to confusing to deal with when you're groggy in the morning. It was also one of these half-glass shower wall designs (which seem to be common in Europe) so half the tub was wide open, while the other half was enclosed. There was a small glass door that could swing shut to prevent water from spraying out, but it then closed you in to a very tiny space with the water over you all the time. I prefer a shower where I have space to step back and soap then rinse, etc. So that was annoying. We didn't try the jacuzzi tub option so can't comment on that. There was a welcome basket of fruit and two complimentary bottles of water. There was also a mini-bar with items for a fee. The room had a massive wardrobe with plenty of room for storage. And there was a nice thin-screen TV elevated in the room so it was not in the way of anything. High-speed internet was available in the room; if you have a laptop they can provide a cable. The roof deck was wonderful with a 360 degree view of the city. It was a great place to relax after a hot day of touring and also nice to socialize with other guests. We met a nice family who also found the hotel through this site. There is a small bar adjacent to the deck but it was never being attended when we would pass by so we didn't use it. We also noticed that there was also a small bar just off the lobby. Breakfast was a very nice buffet with many choices of breads, cakes, pastries, fruit, cheese, cold cuts, as well as hot dishes like eggs, bacon, and potatoes. Great way to start the day. As far as service goes, this would probably be my only slight complaint. My first impression of the hotel was mixed. Upon arriving by water taxi, the bellman was promptly there to retrieve our bags. When we headed to the front desk though we were met with a clerk named Monica. There was a bit of a pause there though as she wouldn't even acknowledge us. No \"hello\", \"how are you\", \"can I help you\". I had to say to her that we were checking in (which was obvious with bags everywhere) and then she proceeded to do the check-in. She was very reserved and seemed uncomfortable or flustered when we would ask any question. She always had an answer to the question, but she just wasn't very friendly. I then asked Monica about an email request I had sent to the hotel a few weeks prior requesting to reserve the secret itineraries tour for The Doge's Palace. She looked around, said nothing was reserved, and basically brushed me off. I said I had gotten a response from Divina who wanted me to choose a time for the tour which I responded to. Monica went to the emails (they keep all of them on file, which is helpful) and said she would let me know. When I came down later to check she asked me if I had gotten a confirmation number from them and I said no. She then said that nothing had been booked. She then went to the emails and tried to say that it was my fault because I hadn't confirmed a time back to them. I told her to read the emails again. She did and saw that I had requested a time. This is where the problem was uncovered. It was Monica, not Divina, who had responded to my email confirming a time. The thing is I had also asked a question about St. Mark's Cathedral in the email. Monica answered that question but ignored my request for a time for the Doge's Palace. And apparently Divina didn't realize I had replied back because Monica had intercepted the email. Realizing that the tour hadn't been booked I didn't find it a big deal and just wanted to know what else we could find to get us on the tour. Monica kept focusing on the emails though and went on and on about them becoming very defensive. She didn't seem to like the fact that it was her screw up that caused the tour not to be booked even though I was not blaming anyone. She kept mentioning that I should have asked for a confirmation number. At that point I was getting annoyed and asked her to please forget what had already happened and to focus on seeing if we could get a tour booked now. She then called the Palace tour office but they had nothing available until the next week. She then pulled out a tour from an outside company and said she could book that for us. It cost 200 Euro per person!!! The other tour was only about 16 Euro, so I said no thank you that we would just tour the palace on our own. We later found ourseleves beset by her trying to sell us on tours the next day when I asked her about taking a vaparetto out to Murano and where we could catch it. Without answering the question she pulled out a tour book and tried to sell us on tours. I said I wasn't interested and asked her to please tell us again where we could take the vaparetto to Murano. I don't know if she got a comission on these tours, but I didn't like her sales tactics. Overall she was just very unhelpful as she either seemed annoyed by questions or really unsure with her answers. Contrast this with Divina who was extremely helpful in answering questions and was friendly. My friend's bag wheels broke off on our way to the water taxi and he needed to find a shop that would sell a massive sized suitcase to replace that one since it was now unusable. Divina called all around to various hotels to see if any contacts she knew were aware of a store that sold large suitcases. The bellman had identified the area of the city but didn't know the name. Divina couldn't find out the name either despite her calls, but she made a great effort which was very appreciated. We went to the area of the city the bellman mentioned and did find the bag store though so all worked out. One other complaint continues with the check-in. The desk clerk has an employee (possibly from housekeeping?) accompany you to your room to show you where it is. The woman took us there opened the door and left. She didn't say anything special about the room. When we walked in the room was hot though as the A/C had been turned off. We weren't sure how to work it. When the bellman came up with bags 10 minutes later he remarked about how hot it was and went over to turn on the A/C and showed us how to control it. We felt that the woman who brought us to the room should've showed us that or any other unique things about the room. Other than these minor service issues it was a wonderful stay and I would highly recommend this property. It's the perfect location in town as it's close to everything but you're not drowning in the tourist craziness of the St. Mark's area.", "Date": "September 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Worcester", "Title": "\u201cmirror mirror\u201d", "Author": "flowercat2", "ReviewID": "UR8711094", "Content": "Have just returned from two days in Venice staying at the Foscari Palace.

The work on the adjacent property is still ongoing so the taxi couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t dock right outside the Foscari Palace when we arrived, but it did pick us up from the hotel jetty when we left as a barge thing had been moved.

The location was pretty good, about a 10-15 walk to St Marks square, although I am not sure how accurate that is....because when in Venice you can never really be sure how many times you have walked around in a circle. We took a water taxi from the port right to the entrance of the hotel. There is something very exciting and romantic about that. The hotel staff was exceptionally nice and they allowed us to check into our room hours early. The room was well fashioned but a slight disappointment. The furniture was a little over the top. The bed cover was a beautiful thick down blanket attached to the decorative side of the duvet. Meaning that the only blanket available for use is the type of blanket that does not get washed between uses. This and this alone really put me off to the hotel. There were visible white crusty spots all over the blanket. We were completely appalled and quickly removed the blanket, turned down the air conditioner, and slept in layers as we only had a sheet for a cover. When one is paying over $300 a night to stay at a classy romantic place, the standards for cleanliness (among other things) goes up significantly.

We took the vaporetto from the train station to the Ca d'oro stop and it was very close (no crossing bridges with luggage). They gave us great directions to the closest stop for the airport and only paid 6 euros per person opposed to the 90 euros for a water taxi. Il Fornaio bakery close to the vaporetto stop was wonderful! They had great pastries and this little pink ball thing kind of like a small sugar covered cake that was amazing. We also ate at Trattoria da Gianni by the hotel (make a right when you leave the square). It'll be on your left. It had great calamari and cheap house wine.

There were some great things to be sure, but overall our experience was very so-so. We stayed at the Foscari for three nights in Feb. It was our honeymoon so we splurged for the Gonzaga Suite, and spent a lot of money on it. So naturally, among the good things was the room itself, the fantastic balconies and the view. Also a plus is the location which many others have commented on, and the cocktail party. Here come the minuses, and let me preface this by saying that Venice was the last stop on our honeymoon, and we had been absolutely spoiled in our first two hotel choices. Nonetheless, this was more expensive than either of those, so I would expect this to be on par. Our first problem was the service, which was at best, cold, and at worst, really frustrating. On a few occassions we asked for advice on how to get somewhere, or whether reservations would be needed, and always we were met with indifference. When we needed an extra pillow, we were treated as if we had asked for the most difficult thing in the world. As others mentioned, the jacuzzi bath did not work, so i expected that, but one night we lost hot water altogether- not even at a time you would expect many to be using it- and again we were treated as if were out of line to inquire when the water may be working again. The bed was uncomfortable, and not because it was a typically firmer european mattress, but rather, it felt just like a very cheap motel mattress. The beds (twins adjoined) would slide across the floor every time you got up or down. My husband and I would wake in the morning with a foot gap between our beds (which was funny but annoying) Finally, the worst part was breakfast. I understand that Italians dont eat hot breakfast like americans, but that wasnt the problem at all- I had come to love having a caprese or other simple breakfast. Here, the hot selections were fine, but the items you would expect to be good in italy were not. I had the worst mozerella here, the meats were very tough, and the breads were subpar. One morning, after giving up on those items, i just had some cereal. After i dumped milk on it and in my coffee, I began to smell something- the milk was completely soured!! Luckily, there was another pitcher of milk out, but my suspicion is that the urn that held the milk was not refrigerated the night before. It was unpleasant to say the least. So basically, i would say that this is a decent hotel. I don't think it deserves the raves it recieves on this board, and in the future I might try another location. It is not like this was the worst experience ever, it's just that those special touches you expect at this price level were not there (ie- in every other hotel we stayed at in Italy, the concierge would leave something special in our room to congratulate us, here my husband spent 50 euro to get a bottle of bad bubbly). Perhaps it was our fault for traveling after carnevale? In any case, I wish I could rave along with the others, but it just wasn't great for us.

Also the mirror of the cosmetic lighted mirror was missing. When I told the front desk, they quickly fixed the toliet seat (after all this would have been a deal breaker...) but said a previous guest broke the mirror and they were waiting on a repair. Ok.... Also our room was right outside the maid station. So at 7am, you heard her set up her cart with the towels, etc. And the big plastic garbage bags she hauled around sounded magnified at 7am with the ecoeing in the marble hallway. It sounded like she was right in the room! Also even with the shutters shut, you could hear the base 'ba boom' from the carnivale music on the canel... ok given the spirit of carinval (purpose of our visit) but it gets old at 5am, you know?

We were not disappointed. The location is excellent as it is within easy walking distance of the major attractions, close to the vaperetto stop Ca D'Oro and right beside the public gondola ferry across to the other side of the Grand Canal. The hotel is spotlessly clean and the rooms are large, with high ceilings, good bathrooms and all the amenities one would expect eg plasma tv, safe, double sinks, comfortable beds etc. Although our bath featured a jacuzzi and a spa/jet shower, as with other reviewers, we could not get this to work. I think it was a gimick that has not stood the test of time. The breakfast was plentiful and the staff were polite and spoke good English. Thank you to the reviewer who left directions from the airport to the hotel entrance - we followed them exactly and they were perfect. We experienced two very different restaurants, both were wonderful. The first was on the Saturday evening at the San Georgiano (exit hotel turn right into Strada Nova at the end turn left. Hotel San Georgiano on right corner and restaurant along on left. The food was up market Italian and very good (my husband particularly recommends the pastry with peppers, oil and garlic) I had the lobster special. The second dining experience came on Sunday lunchtime when we visited the island of Murano (don't expect glass blowing demonstrations at the weekend - this is a working island and like the rest of us, they work mon-fri) We ambled along from Faro vaporetto stop along the side of the water, across the bridge next to the glass tree and again across the next bridge to the bigger part of the island. We kept the water on our right and took the first turning left. This led us into the Campo San Bernardo. Everything seemed closed, but we heard the tell tale tinkling of cutlery on plates. We followed our ears, then our noses and found an Osteria in the square that had no publicity outside, no open doors etc. Bravely we pushed open the door and were welcomed with an amazing aroma of fresh food, fish, garlic and warmth. The waiter showed us to the back of the restaurant where we sat amongst tables of 12 - 16 multi-generational families - all locals. We had bowls of steaming spaghetti with tender clams and fresh fish or meat to follow. The restaurant gave us (unasked and complimentary) a dish of venetian hard biscotti and a glass of sweet wine to dunk them into. 1 litre of wine, 1 litre of water and the bill came to less than 40 Euros.

We did have to wait for a day, but in all fairness, we didn't let them know in advance of our need. As such, we were quite grateful for their kindness and assistance in this matter. The staff, overall, was wonderfully efficient and friendly. We were surprised with a lovely invitation from the hotel manager to an evening reception with period music, prosecco, and chocolates. Quite an enjoyable surprise for our last evening in Venice! The only thing that would make this hotel even better would be a restaurant on premises. However, the breakfast they provide in the morning was wonderful, and the staff was very good at pointing out restaurants in the area.

We stayed in the hotel from 10th-13th January (great time of year to visit Venice as it wasn't as busy as the summer months - no queues in sight!!). The location is excellent (one block away from the Ca D'oro vaporetto stop). We arrived at Marco Polo airport and got the blue ATVO bus (costing 3 Euros per person) which runs from right outside arrivals. It tool about 10-15 minutes and takes you to the Piazza Roma (the bus station). From here, we got our tickets for the ACTV (vaporetto) - we got a 3 day pass (costing 25 Euros per person - well worth it!) and got the No.1 vaporetto - Ca D'Oro is the 5th stop. After getting off the vaporetto, walk up the alley way (there's only one so you can't go wrong), turn right at the end and take your first right again. The hotel is on your left, right next to the Grand Canal. We had room 304 which was amazing - it was a 'superior' double and was spacious and equipped with everything you could possibly need! The bathroom was lovely - twin marble sinks, toilet, bidet and a hydromassage shower over the jacuzzi bath. The shower wasn't quite as I'd thought - the water only comes from one 'source' and doesn't squirt from all angles at once. We didn't manage to get the jacuzzi working either - the hotel staff tried but could not get it to work either. They said they'd get an engineer to look at it but this did not happen in our time at the hotel. There was a huge mirror on one wall of the bathroom, a lighted shaving mirror and numerous other lighting options - and even a built in radio (about 3 stations). The room itself had a huge double bed (well, it was two singles pushed together), a desk, small armchair, lcd tv mounted on the wall, electronic safe in the wardrobe (no charge). There were also tea and coffee making facilities but I have heard that the hotel charges for tea and coffee etc so worth taking a few supplies. The room also had a patio doors leading to a small balcony (with outside table and 2 chairs). Below there was a view of the street below and looking to the left was a view of the Grand Canal - amazing!! The reception staff were all very helpful. We were given a recommendation of a restaurant - can't quite remember the name but began with a G and was the closer of the two they recommended. We were not impressed - it was rather expensive and the service was not the best we've encountered. The food was ok but again, not the best we've had! The other one (on the coast) was shut so could not try that one. There's a good variety of shops which seem to stretch from the Piazza Roma right to St Marks Square and beyond. St Marks, by the way, is about 10-15 minutes leisurely walk, and the Rialto bridge is about 5 minutes walk. If you haven't been to Venice before, it is all flat walking except for the bridges that cross the canals. The hotel gave us a free water taxi to Murano (a must do when in Venice!). There is no catch with this service and does in fact make you feel like James Bond when travelling through the small canals on a fast boat (felt like a limo on water!!) We were given a demonstration of glass blowing which was amazing. There are many rooms filled with items you can buy. We did feel that we were being followed around by one of the staff which was annoying so we left without buying anything. There are numerous other shops on the island which sell the glass so we bought a couple of little keepsakes from these instead. The vaporetto runs back to Venice from numerous locations around the island so getting back is not a problem.

My family were taken to a incredible room that served as the Grand Ballroom when The Foscari was an embassy! Our room was enormous with 14 overstuffed chairs and a King size bed. This was not what I expected in europe where rooms tend to be small. There was a large fireplace and a plasma TV(not that you need that when in Venice). There were double doors that opened up to another room that overlooked the Grand Canal It had a few sofas and some beds for my 2 sons. My first reaction was WOW. I told my wife and kids not to unpack as I assumed the hotel booking staff had made a mistake and placed us in the wrong room. I checked back at the front desk and the incredibly helpful staff assured me that the room we were given was the one that suggest for a family. OK... so the room was incredible. The staff was very helpful and provided a lot of guidance for first timers to Venice. We enjoyed catching up with some other travelers at breakfast (it was delicious with lots of hot and cold choices) and meeting up with some at the end of the day in the common room off the lobby. The hotel staff did a fine job of pointing us to restaurants that were tucked away in little neighborhoods rather than the tourist traps. I cannot say enough good things about the rooms, the location, the staff, and the food.

Room 101 is HUGE, with what must be 20 foot ceilings (wood beamed and paneled) green marble floors, & a very US sized bathroom. Rm 103 was also very comfortable, with a nicely wood inlaid floor with some rugs, marble floored bathroom as well. Ceiling likewise tall, but not so ornately decorated. Both bathrooms had a tub/shower combination unit that is also a jacuzzi tub! Internet access is via Ethernet cable. No extra charge. Music from 5 different channels can be heard over speakers mounted in the walls of your bedrooms and bathrooms (can listen to different channels in each room) Rooms kept immaculately & were very quiet. Occasionally you'd hear people on boats as they were on the Grand Canal, but not often. You could hear the a number of gondolas rocking in their moorings outside, but this seemed a restful sound, not disturbing. The hotel has a private dock so you can, as we did, take a private taxi from the airport directly to the hotel and not have to navigate your luggage around the sidewalks. Literally right outside the front door is Campo St. Sophia where you will find a traghetto that crosses the Grand Canal for 0.50 Euro/person so you do not have to walk down to the Rialto bridge to cross. Gondoliers are right there as well. A short block up towards the train station is the vaproetto stop for the #1 Vaporetto. The main 'drag' to the Rialto bridge (a major shopping street) is likewise right out of the front door. St. Mark's is about a 10 minute walk, and is quite easy to follow. The Rialto is no more than 5 minutes away. The train station is perhaps a 20 minute walk in the other direction. Good restaurants are less than a 2 minute walk away. There is a nice platform on the rooftop for sitting out with a nice view of the Grand Canal and the rooftops of Venice. We only went up there once however due to the brisk weather we had during our stay. Breakfast was VERY complete. Scrambled Eggs, the European equivalent of bacon, & sausage all hot. Hardboiled eggs and a large table piled high with yogurt, cereal, cheeses, 3 kinds of cold cuts, juices, fruits, torts and you can order up a cappuccino. A mini bar is also provided inn your room. The front desk personnel were very friendly and helpful, spoke enough English, and had good suggestions for nearby places to eat dinner, & the like. I booked these rooms in Feb 2006 and got a rate of 125 Euro/night for the Classic double through [--].

Many thanks folks because this really is a delightful hotel and I wouldn't have found it otherwise. Of course, the hotel's main advantage is it's location directly on the Grand Canal together with the sensible room rates. The No 1 vaporetto stop (Bus/coach/ rail connections - St Marks' Square -Lido) is just a block away. There's also a gondola ferry crossing - a 'Traghetti' - that's literally outside the side door and the gondoliers will ferry you across for 50 (euro) cents a go over to the main fish and vegetable markets - it's like living over Covent Garden but so peaceful and quiet at night! Take my advice and arrive in style from Marco Polo Airport in a water taxi. It's 100 euro but worth every cent and you can always eat pizza for dinner later if you need to make an economy. (There's loads of pizza bars, pavement cafes, 2 supermarkets and decent restaurants around the corner from the hotel. I just liked sitting in the corner cafe reading my book.) Some reviewers have complained about having to buy teabags from the room mini-bar. So, yes, bring your own with you if you must - but you won't starve or go thirsty in this place! - breakast is a joy - even for vegetarians like me - you are really spoiled for choice - and the staff are always happy to oblige with morning tea or espresso. I walked my socks off in Venice - so come prepared with stout walking shoes. There is an exquisite delight to see around each street corner and if this is your first time in Venice, the urge to explore is irresistible. I took vaporetti trips to Murano and Burano (thoroughly recommended) just so I would sit down!

The bedroom is entered through double doors off the living room and is directly above the main street entrance of the hotel. Both rooms are gigantic and beautifully furnished!

What is recommended though is that before booking you research thoroughly what room you will get. We were on the second floor, deluxe front canal view rm 201 which was fine and yes did have a wonderful frontal view ending with the markets over the other side. However, there was construction work on either side and some of the rooms I would imagine would be facing the scaffolding and not getting much of a view at all.

The staff generally were great especially Divna on reception who responded to my booking emails really promptly and who was very helpful and friendly when we were there and the barman who served us a cracking martini. However, my only criticism was that when we arrived the guy on reception didn't really welcome us in a particularly warm way but was politely efficient in his conversation with us. I think it was this slightly 'coldish' behaviour that some of the past reviewers must have been talking about. After that though the reception staff were fine.

It's always worrisome to book a hotel in another country, especially if you don't know the language. I've heard horror stories from others about lost reservations and horrible reservation staff but I can say from my own experience at this particular hotel that you will have nothing to worry about. We booked our stay on Expedia, only staying overnight as it was the last night of our cruise (15 night) vacation and I knew we'd want to get home but didn't want to miss out on Venice. Upon embarkation from the cruise ship, we wandered over to the water taxi station to catch a ride. Not cheap, let me advise you there. It was 90 euros to hire a taxi. That said, it was a good choice as we had 4 very heavy suitcases and two carry ons and since we were only staying one night-we didn't have time to waste. The Foscari Palace sits right on the Grand Canal with a gondola station right out front. The reservation staff was friendly and helpful and we had no trouble with our reservation whatsoever. They all speak English, so that was also a bonus. Our room was clean and had unexpected surprises such as a flat screen TV, fluffy robes and a foot massager in the jetted tub. We had a welcome basket of fruit from the manager as well! The location is wonderful-off the main tourist route, quiet at night and the room shut up so dark that I was grateful for my wake up call or else we might have slept until noon. It's a nice hike to St. Mark's, so bring your (flat) walking shoes. We thought we must do a stop at Harry's Bar but let me tell you, it's much too expensive to sit and have a few drinks. Take a look inside and save your money! All restaurants inside St. Mark's are terribly expensive but we found a great place just around the corner where we had a great meal with our ship friends. I don't think it's possible to have a bad meal in Venice unless you're crabby and unadventurous. A gondola ride, 35-40 minutes, ran us 80 euros. We had to do it and no, you don't need to make a reservation unless you wish to do a ride after 7PM. You can catch a gondola at many places along the canals. We chose one that was black and gold and flashy. Our gondolier didn't sing to us but he gave us a nice tour with a history lesson and answered all of our questions. After a nice evening, a good night's rest, we were treated to an EZ check out and a wonderful breakfast. We opted to take the water taxi to the airport for the simplicity of it all and were glad we had made a reservation as a few of the vaparetto *buses* were on strike that day. It was 90 Euros to Marco Polo airport, another 20 Euros for a porter who took us directly to our check in line.

The Rialto bridge is also just 5 minutes away. There are some nice restaurants close by (ask the Hotel for a recommendation) and for shopaholics you will be spoilt for choice. Now then, the Hotel itself. If you can possibly afford it, get a water taxi from Marco Polo airport right to the door, it's a really memorable way to arrive and worth the extra expense. The Hotel is small and personal and very tastefully furnished and professionally run. The staff are very polite and courteous. The rooms are large and beautifully appointed with flat screen TV's, marble floors and bathrooms and mini bars. The beds are large and comfortable and attention is paid to detail (fruit bowl on arrival, bath robes and slippers, leaving pack etc) with a bed turn down service in the evening. A real MUST is to use the roof terrace (order your drinks at the bar first) as you get fantastic views across the roof tops towards St. Marks square and beyond.

The good service starts before arrival as all my EMails were answered warmly & within hours. When we left Divna came out to see us off in our watertaxi, it was like leaving friends. There have been a small number of reviewers who say they were treated coldly, this puzzles me as this differs totally from my own experience.

Some reviewers appear to have issues with their room & views. It really is a question of receiving what you pay for, particularly in an expensive city like Venice. There is no such thing as a free lunch, if you require a full canal view then you must pay for it. The prices at the Foscari are remarkably reasonable when compared to other hotels in Venice. I thought our lovely suite for what we paid was a bargain. This is my fourth trip to Venice so I feel familiar with what is on offer at what price. The location is perfect & I will not add to what has already been explained fully and very well by other reviewers. To sum up, the Foscari Palace made our latest visit to Venice the best yet & although I usually like to try different places to stay wherever I go, I will make the exception for the Foscari Palace & will return there as soon as possible.

LCD TV in room, probably only because there is no room for a fatter tv. There is no space to put your cases. The bathroom looked good- shower with body jets and whirl bath.

Divna and Madaleena were charming and informative. It was easy to book our stay conversing with Divna by Email and we also arranged to have a water taxi from the airport to the hotel. Bit pricey at 120 euros but what an experience! However coming home we found it quite easy to take our cases to Fondamente Nove, 5 minutes walk through the back streets, and hop on boat to airport for 6 euros each. We would certainly arrive this way next time now we know where the hotel is. We were surprised that tea and coffee was not complimentary in the room, never come across this before (tea bag costing 1.40 euros) - take your own! On the whole hotel was just perfect. Breakfast room was lovely with plenty of choice. Sitting on the roof enjoying a cocktail in the evening looking out over the rooftops of Venice was an unforgettable experience!

The hotel is fantastic and in a great location and we had wonderful views over the Grand Canal. So why the disappointment, firstly I have to agree with several other reviewers that the staff can be quite abrupt and this especially surprised me as the warmth of the staff at the Jesolo hotel could not have been better. Secondly there is building work being carried out on both sides of this hotel and from a superficial look this is not likely to end sometime soon despite management assurances, work also commences before 9 in the morning so beware. Thirdly although there is a nice touch of complementary fruit and warm bottled water in the room, having to pay extra for the coffee and biscuits sticks in your throat a bit. Breakfast was no more than satisfactory, especially when compared to the Jesolo although I appreciate that there are restricted facilities to prepare this.

Seeing the sights of Venice was special but finding a great hotel such as Foscari Palace to return too afterwards simply made our trip\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6magical. Venice is a pricey destination in just about every respect, but Foscari is an excellent value and well worth the price. The previous positive reviews say it all. Immaculate interior decor, receptive and knowledgeable staff, outstanding service across-the-board, and of course\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.the rooms. We have traveled to many European countries and this is the first time I have seen a bathroom of this size and caliber. The multiple shower nozzles/Jacuzzi/bath and piped in music if you so desire are all great touches. Trust me\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.not your typical European bathroom. I could go on and on about the breakfast buffet but I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been covered enough in previous posts. In short\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.awesome! On the 3rd floor, you can go up the stairs to the rooftop where there are chairs and tables and enjoy one of the most breathtaking views of the Grand Canal. As they say in a familiar commercial\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.priceless. Location is a big plus. We did not have the luxury to explore every nook and crevice of Venice on foot because our 5 year old son gets tired after just 30-60 minutes of walking so we utilized the heck out of the waterbuses. Foscari Palace is just a couple of minutes away from the Ca d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Oro water bus stop (route #1) that brought us to every stop on our \u00e2\u20ac\u0153must see\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd list. I highly recommend the waterbus pass for the duration of your stay for unlimited hop on-hop off convenience. Foscari is also a quick walk to lots of shops and restaurants on Strada Nova. There is also a grocery store (Billa) that sells everything at a reasonable price (not like the 7 euro plus sodas down at the Square). We turned to Billa for our bottled water, soda, toiletries, fresh fruit and such\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.a life saver. If you start from the hotel, turn left at the street and keep going straight until you hit a little bridge, cross over it and Billa is on your right. The hotel has no restaurant for lunch or dinner but there are several restaurants, bars, gellato stands, pizza and kebab places to suit everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taste. Yes\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6even a McDonalds is just around the corner from the hotel. You are also within walking distance of the Fondamenta Nove strip. The strip has a waterbus stop (route #41/42) to go island hopping towards Murano (famous for it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Venetian glass). I noticed that the Murano glass wares were more expensive on the island than on the streets of Venice. Do some comparison shopping before you flat out make a purchase on Murano. SOME TIPS: Buy a waterbus pass for the duration of your stay \u00e2\u20ac\u201c It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great way to see Venice via the Grand Canal. It was like 25 euro for a three day bus and waterbus pass. Pack light \u00e2\u20ac\u201c If you must take \"everything\" with you\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6then a Water Taxi is the way to go (approx 90 euro) from Airport to Hotel. Otherwise, a simple ACTV bus from the Airport to Piazzale Roma (main drop off point for waterbuses), then waterbus to hotel will suffice (all for less than 10 euro per person). Dining \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Be aware! Meal cost include much more than just your first and second course. Restaurants add an unavoidable \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bread and cover\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd charge plus a \"service charge\" to your meal. Some restaurants also charge by weight of the fish or meat (per gram). So, after ordering the wine, appetizer, dessert and a digestivo (after-dinner drink), your bill can quickly add up. Also, the quality of the food tends to get better the farther away from the beaten path. Final thoughts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Foscari Palace is truly a wonderful place to stay. It is just a hop, skip and a jump (or boat ride) away from all the main sights/attractions, yet far enough from the crowd and touristy atmosphere. The professional staff (Divna, Madallena, Giuseppe, Menelio, Gerald all the way to the cleaning ladies) were very accommodating throughout our stay.

The first impression of the hotel and the lobby are positive. It was freezing cold and beautifully decorated and I was impressed. However, our room, although rather large, was a big disappointment. First of all it was dreadfully hot and stuffy when we entered , and there were several flys flying around an overly ripe fruit basket that was meant to welcome us. Trying to have a positve attitude, we chased and swatted the flys, turned on the air and hoped for the best. On to the bathroom, it was so dark even with all the lights turned on, the makeup mirror was cracked and the light didnt work and there was an \"odor\" about it that we smelled every time we entered our room. The bathtub was so small that I (5'6\" and 130lbs) could not move or turn around in it, and the shower contraptions were difficult to figure out and had very little water pressure to them. When we went downstairs several hours after checking in and inquired if the air in our room should be as cold as the lobby, the somewhat aloof ( and they were aloof the entire stay..I can see why others have complained)staff said they would check into it. We left to find dinner, and when we had returned to our room,hoping to find it had cooled off, we found that they had turned OFF the air. It was now about a stiffling 85 degrees in our room. The next morning, as it had still not cooled off, we inquired again, and this time asked that no one please turn off our air again. They said they would check into it, but nothing was ever done. We stayed in 4 different Italian hotels, all reviewed on this site, and this was the only one we felt did not measure up at all as to what others were saying. The only thing I can figure out is that it must depend on which room you stay in. Also, we had construction to look at and hear outside our window, I am talking large cranes and clanking machienery. We had no canal view, and we had a double superior room, so don't think you automatically get a view by having a superior room. The odd thing about this hotel is that they appear to be trying to be a level 4 star hotel (turn down service with little towels place on the floor next to your bed) but they are seriously lacking in the comforts and service that really distinguish a good hotel from an average one. The other two 3 star hotels we stayed at during this trip, were far superior in service and in accomadations.

Very efficient (and English speaking) rapid responses to my emails and it was all sorted very rapidly. IMPRESSIVE! I made the booking several months in advance and checked everything was OK two weeks before by mail explaining the importance of the stay and the details of our likely arrival time. On arrival we were greeted by name (just how impressive is that?) and had a bottle of sparkling wine on ice awaiting us in our room with a Happy Birthday message. As stated by other reviewers the hotel was excellent, the room superb and, in our case, the Grand Canal view just made it the perfect stay. Everything was spotless with nice touches of fresh fruit in the room and a leaving box of juice and cookies. The breakfast buffet (served in a smallish dining room) had a variety of fresh fruit, meats, cheeses, breads, teas, coffee, yougourts,.....and a few hot dishes. The rooftop balcony was lovely for a nightcap before bed. And the service was just perfect - polite and friendly with special mention to the femaile receptionist (sorry we ddn't get her name) who was particularly helpful and the barman who on our second visit to the rooftop terrace remembered our drink choice from the first and our room number. This IS a boutique hotel and meets every criterion I can think of as measures of what it purports to be. It IS NOT a large luxury hotel with large communal areas and its own restaurant. The hotel also has a narrow frontage onto the Grand Canal with other rooms either looking out onto a narrow alley or a small Campo so unless you book one of the few special rooms, don't expect great views of Venice but the that's probably true of most of the hotels in Venice. I say this becuase Venice is expensive and so is the Foscari so it is important to understand what you get and then you won't be disappointed. For us, we cannot thank the staff enough for their thoughtfulness and service - it has been one of the most enjoyable few days we have spent anywhere. Getting there. Because it was such a special time, we splashed out on a Water taxi from the airport direct the hotel front door - just magical. However, the airport water bus line stops at Fondamenta Nuove (6 euros each way). It takes about 40 minutes as you don't need to go to St Marks Square via the Lido. From Fondamenta Nuove it is a 10 minute walk and if you choose the right route, there are only two brdiges to cross. In reality nowehere in Venice is far from anywhere else. It may take 40 minutes on the vapaetto from the hotel to San Marco but we walked it in under 20 minutes. It is about 10 minutes walk to the Rialto but take the traghetto outside the hotel across the Grand Canal and the walk is less than 5 minutes.

(10-15 mins walk to St Marks) We walked miles (take a range of flat comfortable shoes) was great to see the tiny walkways and bridges. RECOMENDED SIGHTS: St Marks Basilica(obviously!) Campanile - (tower) Take a trip up the tower for fantastic views (hired Dictaphone 4 euros for 2 people) Doge's Palace - (booked secret itinery tour before we went at --- prevents queuing, 16 euros pp includes palace entrance) The guided tour took you away from the crowds and behind a locked door, showing you Casanovas cell where he tried to escape, the torture room and various other things no one else sees. Then after the tour you can go around the palace on your own. Jewish Ghetto - worth a visit Campo Rocco (in Santa Croce) - Nice Square and lovely church Gondola ride - Business seems to slacken about 3ish so good prices to be had. Paid 80 euros for about 40 mins. Lido - if you have enough time and in need of some R and R ( rest and relaxation!) We took the water bus (vaporetto) from outside the hotel to the Lido (5 euro pp each way) when you get of the bus just go straight down Gran Viale Elisabetta (main street) turn left at the bottom to the public beach (spiaggia pubblica) You can hire 2 beds and an umbrella for about 22 euros for the whole day (is cheaper after 2.30pm) RECOMENDED RESTAURANT Algiubagio in Cannaregio next to the Fondamente Nove water bus stop. (---) This restaurant had a huge inventive meat menu ( fillet steak to die for, Ostrich, duck etc) a welcome relieve from fish. This was the best restaurant we had been to in Venice and went back the following night for a fantastic pizza also! Recommend booking (Divna at hotel reception sorted this out for us) We Stayed at Foscari Palace for 4 nights and had 5 full days, this was a nice length time. We came to Venice to celebrate our 10th Wedding anniversary and loved it, we have some wonderful memories that we'll always cherish.

The other window would open - however we had to keep it closed most of the time due to the building work next door. This started at around 7.30am and WAS loud enough to wake us up. The 'view' was the protective covering over the building next door whilst building work took place - this was so close you could reach out and toucg it. The most disappointing part of the stay was the unaffected attitude of the staff (with the exception of the lady who ran the breakfast area - v.friendly and efficient!). We explained at reception that we had specifically requested a quite room when booking as it was our honeymoon and could we be moved. We were told that the type of room we had paid for was full and that there was nothing in the same price range to offer us. We weren't even asked if we wanted to pay to upgrade. This 'unaffected' attitude greeted us from most members of staff - we were rather glad we had alot planned as it made the time in the hotel minimal.

This was disappointing especially since there was a large armoire in the room that I thought would hold the suitcases. But due to the way the drawers were set up in the armoire you couldnt use it to hold the suitcases. We ended up hauling the suitcases to the top of the armoire to store them which others had done before as there was carpet on the top. But when you had to get into a suitcase you had to haul it down and put it on the bed. The last night there it rained and since we were on the top of the third floor the rain was very loud above us. It may as well have been a tin roof. I think this could have been avoided if you stay away from a couple of rooms on the third floor. All in all the hotel was pleasant.

Two minutes from the Ca d'oro vaporetto stop, and opposite the Traghetto, which takes you on a slightly precarious, but quick standing-room only ferry across the canal to the Rialto markets. Perfect! Our 'superior' room was huge, obviously only recently restored ,with an elegant, light and airy decor, plasma satellite TV and a great marble bathroom. The bath and shower with all their extra fittings (jacuzzi, massage etc) took some working out, but were worth it!! We too appreciated the fresh fruit on arrival, and the farewell goodies for the journey home. We found all the staff unfailingly helpful; they booked us into some fantastic restaurants, which tourists wouldnt normally find, including a fish restaurant nearby that took some finding even with directions! We were the only non-locals there, and the owner, who also had a fish stall on the Rialto market, served up the most amazing selection of the freshest fish you could imagine. The cocktail party at the hotel on the Saturday evening was a bonus - great fun - and also an opportunity to meet up with another couple on the same flight home - we were able to share the cost of a water taxi back to the airport with them - from the hotel landing stage to the airport cost a total of 90 Euros for the four of us, but was worth it with an early flight to catch. One of the best attractions of this small hotel has to be the roof terrace where we sat in the sun and drank cocktails overlooking the Grand Canal - not many hotels can offer that! The only downside is the renovation work currently going on on both sides of the hotel. It didnt affect us at all as we were there for the weekend and a Bank Holiday, but could possibly annoy you if you were there when work was going on.

I had selected the Foscari Palace on the basis of the reviews. I wanted a place with a water view, close enough to the sites, but not slap bang in the centre of a tourist hotspot. What a great choice I made. I booked the Foscari Suite and could not have made a better choice for my wife. The suite is made up of a living room *and* room 108 with it's bathroom. The 'living room' is 35 X 20 ft ish with 14 windows (yes I am not joking) and a superb view of the Grand Canal, sitting almost right next door to Ca D'Oro, and opposite one of the markets of San Polo (though the hotel is in Cannaregio). The hustle and bustle of everything is in front of your eyes and it is truly great. The room had masses of sitting places and a table for 8 (I think it gets used as a general purpose hotel room for all guests when not booked as part of the suite). 50 inch plasma TV with English channels (but BBC World needed to be retuned) though we rarely used it, prefering to be out in the city or staring out the window. The bedroom was even bigger at say 35 X 35 ft, fitted with twin beds (would have been nice to have a double but they were very large single beds, easily long enough for my 6ft 4 inch frame). French doors to the two balconies which looked sidewards on to the Grand Canal and overlooked the small campo (or square) to the front of the side entrance of the hotel. All you would expect of such a hotel, plus another plasma screen, and selectable radio through the in-room (and in bathroom) system. Bathroom had a good shower/jacuzzi bath (note - don't use bubble bath and jacuzzi at the same time!). Towel robes you expect, but courtesy slippers is what makes the difference. Marble floors throughout, original wood roof, etc etc etc. The rest of the hotel was impeccable, great handrails, doors, seats. Subtle decor. I found all the staff to be polite and friendly. Lets not forget I had a running email thread going on checking and rechecking things for 3-4 months and they were superb always. They sorted my watertaxi from the airport and the restuarant for my wife's 40th birthday - and what a super recommendation that was as well. As others have said, the properties on either side are under construction but we never heard anything (probably because it was a weekend and a public holiday). We never got to check out the roof terrace but it looked good from what we saw. Breakfasts were enormous. Cheese, meats, bread, toast, fruit juice, eggs, beans, mushrooms, bacon, hot dogs, cereals, fruit, croissants - they had everything and masses of it. Attentative and polite as with the desk staff and bellhop. Okay it cost a lot, but it was easily worth every penny for the impact it made. A welcome basket of fruit and water, flowers, and the 'ciao' box on the last night. Drinks and nibbles on the Saturday evening. Did I mention the Gondala rank outside, or the tragetto 4 steps from the front door - so you can get to the other side of the canal without any hassle. A vaporetto stop (the water bus) within 100 steps. Supermarket close by, reasonable local restuarants. Touring the Grand Canal, we didn't see any other hotel that seemed to have the same combo of location and views - it was 15 minutes fast walk from St Marks Square, but there were so many ways to get there each with a different set of shops/sites that there was little need to run. Cannaregio was interesting, and the hotel was opposite San Polo, and next to Castello so you had the best of all the areas to sample. For the record - the fastest way back to the airport seemed to be the coach from Pizalle de Roma, stand D2, which was 25 minutes from the hotel by water boat, pay on the bus (3E).

It sits on the bank of the Grand Canal and is kept meticulously clean. HOWEVER, and there IS in this case a \"however\", this property has many quirks to consider. The phone system is a nightmare, and if easy contact with your home or office ouside the country is a concern, this may not be the place for you. We ultimately had to leave the hotel and call from a public phone because the hotel staff was unable to help us reach the USA. Our room, number 103, had windows to nowhere, so if you don't mind sleeping in a black hole, this is for you. The beds are very hard and typically Ventian, but the rooms and bathrooms are quite nice although very small. The hotel breakfast was the best we encountered in Italy, the lobby area is truly beautiful, and you could not have found a more impeccably clean property. The front desk staff are abrupt, almost unfriendly, and they make you feel somewhat unwelcome from the moment you arrive. So, the Foscari Palace is a neutral for us.

The room was fairly cramped, but extremely comfortable, with twin beds, a minibar and a flat screen TV (not that we used it!). The bathroom had a jacuzzi bath and power shower with music piped in throughout the bedroom and bathroom. The hotel also has a roof terrace for viewing the grand canal from above. My only gripe was that it was impossible to get the temperature of the bathroom down below 80 degrees, although it was great to come in from the cold to! The surrounding buildings are undergoing some construction work at present (Feb 06), but this does not detract from the fantastic location and views. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would consider staying here again if we return to Venice. If you're feeling nostalgic (and rich!), take a trip to Harry's bar, on the Grand Canal, expensive food and drink, but a fantastic 1940s feel to it. Two glasses of belini was 30 euros, but well worth the expense. Waterbuses arrive every 10 minutes or so and it's worth getting the 3-day pass if you're there for a few days - this costs 25 euros each and allows you to travel on any waterbus, all around the city and to Lido and Murano. The bars and restaurants at St Mark's Square are a little pricey, so I'd recommend finding an off-the-beaten track, authentic Italian restaurant, where you'll get cheaper, higher quality food and service than the main tourist areas.

Arrival was easy from the train station: just a few steps from the Ca D'Oro stop. From the moment we entered, we knew we'd be happy here. We remodel old homes back in the states and were struck by the beauty of the place. It was apparent that it had been recently renovated. All the common areas have beamed ceilings, lovely marble floors, and beautiful wrought iron on the stairs. When you check in, be sure and notice the gorgeous wall and ceiling light fixtures in the lobby...a beautiful eclectic mix of old crystal and very high tech chrome or stainless steel. Stunning! Up the elevator to our double superior room (304). I agree with the reviewer who said rooms are equivalent to a high-end U.S. hotel. Very nice furnishings, fine bedding, high ceiling, nice appointments like varnished wood windows and pretty draperies. English TV was available. Lovely French doors opened on to a good sized terrace, 5' x 12' with a patio table and chairs. The view from the window was unremarkable, but from the terrace there's a great side view of the Grand Canal. And now for the bath...wow! Beautiful marble throughout, double sinks, jacuzzi tub and multi-head shower. All new and beautifully designed. Fluffy robes, towel warmer. It was heaven. We also had a nice welcome basket of fruit, chocolate, and biscuits. Had no problem with the coffee maker...it was much like the one at home. We're early risers and really appreciated having coffee when we wanted it. The breakfast was great, too, even included scrambled eggs and bacon! And, yes, Luigi was there to make our stay even more perfect. The \"soiree\" was most appreciated...guests sipping champagne, listening to the music, all the while watching the snow falling on the Grand Canal. Does it get any better than that?! It was easy walking everywhere...Venice isn't that big. One suggestion for those going in nicer weather. There's a supermarket down the street where I bought olive oil, balsamico and salamis for gifts. While I was in there I noticed their \"deli\" counter. Oh my! Though I'd just had breakfast, my mouth was watering: crusty sandwiches of baby shrimps, curry chicken, etc. This would be a great place to fill a picnic basket! From the hotel, turn left at the street, pass the turn to the vaporetto stop, go over a little bridge and the store is on your right. I hope this review isn't over the top.

We even prevailed upon the bar staff to keep open the cozy bar one evening when we were in need of a night cap very late.

We were upgraded to superior double with a great dual-view (room 101 !). Marble floors/Carved Ceiling - LCD tv - Jacuzzi bath - clean/warm/spacious. The staff were polite and efficient. The hotel is clean and modern, plus ideally situated to explore all of Venice with a great shopping street (Strada Nova)right outside. Rialto Bridge (5 mins) and St Marks (15 mins). Getting lost of beaten track is the best fun. End Nov/early Dec is an great time to visit (weather permitting) with few crowds esp before lunch. We walked around the Doge's palace, Basilica and Campanile had no queues. The gondola ride is very expensive but a must have experience (60 euros). Drinking : Bacaro Jazz (Bellini @ 2 for 1 (7 euro) in happy hour) is a great bar; Harry's Bar is a novelty - size of a front room with Bellini's @ 16 euro each ! Eating : Restaurant in alley opposite Ca' d'Oro (100m from hotel) is a treat (eating with the locals); but we also ate at Foscari recommendation 'Ristorante Al Fontego del Pescaori' was expensive and was only frequented by English voices.

I'm sure they would have been courteous about it if we told them however. The breakfast buffet was very nice. However, you have to eat in the breakfast room and are not allowed to take trays up to your room. If you would like to eat in your room, there is an extra 15 Euro fee. This is the only reason why I rated the hotel above average and not excellent. I've never stayed at a hotel where you can't take food from the buffet to your room. Other hotels have always offered me a tray right away and allowed me to take food to my room. This has always been a must for me since I'm not a morning person and would prefer to stay in my room in the mornings. So if this isn't important to you, then you would love Foscari Palace despite this. The only thing to consider in staying in this hotel is that if you have children, the marble floors may not be the best thing. Otherwise, for honeymooners, etc., get a room with a view overlooking the waters---so romantic, fun and beautiful to look outside your bedroom window.

The standard double room was modern and clean, if just a tad bit on the small/crowded side. Since we did not upgrade to a room with a view, our view was of a building next door that was being renovated.

The shower was quite modern, but as seems to be the case with most hotels in Italy, the water gets everywhere! Their towels and toiletries were first-rate and they also supplied comfy bathrobes. The service at the Foscari was very proper and impeccable. They had a lovely flute/harp duet playing on Thursday evening. Their breakfast buffet was plentiful and delicious. Again, everything just was so proper -- beautifully monogrammed with \"Foscari Palace\" on all the linens, silverware and crystal. The front desk was helpful in offering dining suggestions, calling ahead for reservations, and giving us directions. One thing that we didn't realize until our 2nd day there was that you are supposed to drop off your key before you leave the hotel to explore Venice. This lets them know that you have left your room and they can turn down your bed in the evening. We are used to a more modern system of key cards. Here, they give you an actual key with a very large and heavy key ring! It was quite cumbersome to carry around our first day! The location is very convenient.

The hotel location was great - within walking distance of where we wanted to go, right nearby a vaporetta stop and not too touristy either. Breakfast was indeed great and despite that the clientele were mainly couples our pretty much well behaved boys were alway greeted with smiles.

We were told that for our first night that we would have to share a 2 bedroomed suite with our friends as the Hotels in Venice confirmation was for 4 people with the booking under 1 name but for 2 superior rooms. We tried to discuss this with the Manager on duty(Vicente) but were stonewalled at every turn. He is the most intractable person who operates behind a reception desk possible. I asked to see the Hotels in Venice confirmation but when he looked at it he then refused to show it to us. We were then shown to our room which was 1 large suite with twin beds and an adjoining conference room where the maid was actually making up 2 small camp beds as we went in. This was totally unsatisfactory and we went to TRY and discuss this with Vincente - no apologies or even a reasonable explanation other than to say we would receive our superior rooms for the following 2 nights. We were to be charged for 1 night for 2 people in a superior room - no privacy or real sleep on 2 camp beds. The next night yes we received a suite on the floor above whilst our friends kept the original room after alot of hassle. However it started to rain heavily in the early evening - we went to bed around midnight - my wife woke up around 1.15am saying she was getting wet - water was dripping off the ceiling beams onto the bed. I reported this to the night porter who checked if any other rooms were available(none were) so helped me push the bed to one side of the room and produced a towel to collect the drips. Chinese water torture comes to mind especially for my wife as the drips continued all night. I reported this to Vincente as soon as he arrived on duty next morning and he promised to move us to another room - again no apology or any reduction in room rates - his attitude was that this was an act of God(even Italians can be inventive). Our 3rd room was pretty standard but acceptable and we finally had a decent nights sleep. On trying to sort out a compromise with Vincente over the final bill we had more chance of winning the lottery - we had a final reduction of 40 Euros with still no apology. I do not know what charm school he went to but some serious management issues need to be resolved(it seems he was only the Under Manager as the actual Manager was off ill/holiday depending on when you asked).", "Date": "September 24, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, England", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Getaway\u201d", "Author": "petit_chou-fleur", "ReviewID": "UR3933442", "Content": "I stayed in the Foscari in march with my boyfriend for our 4 year anniversary.

Take your time just wandering round and getting lost in the side streets then end your evening watching the sun set with a bottle of wine on the amazing roof terrace. I dont think you could get a better view of Venice. I recommend taking a gondola late afternoon/early evening when its a bit quieter, and you can watch the sun set. we got a gondola from the station by the Foscari palace, which shuts around 6. To get around get a pass for the Vaperetto that covers the duration of your stay, you can get passes for one day to one week, which saves having to buy a ticket for every journey and means you can hop on and off with ease. And make sure you have comfy shoes! We were disappointed with Murano Island, make sure you pick a good place to watch them making the glass, as some places charge visitors when next door does it for free. Everyone should see venice during their lifetime, its truely wonderful.

It deserves 4.5 stars in my opinion = excellent service in all areas, pristinely clean, and great location. We stayed in the Junior Suite Gonzaga which is on the 2nd floor overlooking the magnificent Grand Canal. The room is over 550 square feet, beautifully decorated, and has 2 balconies. All the glowing reviews of this hotel are correct so there is not much else to say. Easy 10 minute walk to Rialto and then 10 more minutes to St.Mark's. Private terrace on top of hotel is magnificent. This hotel is worth every penny! While in venice, we booked 2 short tours with \"tours-italy\". After extensive travelling abroad and going on many great tours w/small groups, this is the 1st company I do not recommend - at least for the Venice walking tour (2 hours). Huge groups, no detailed info. - guide spoke as fast as auctioneer, and overall very rushed. We spoke to couples that went with 2 other guides, also w/this company and same tour, and they also were EXTREMELY dissappointed. In fact, we all left the tour early - it was that bad. On a positive note however, we had booked them also for the Grand Canal boat tour (70 minutes long) and the guide/tour was excellent. Only negative for this tour - they take the max 8 people and so boat is very crowded for everyone is forced to sit up front. The only reason why our tour ended up to be so great, was one of the couple's went inside the boat (covered area) for more room - though I felt bad for them because their views would not have been as good (small windows) and they couldn't hear the guide as well.

Of the three hotels in Italy I chose through TripAdvisor (the Dei Mellini in Rome, excellent, and the Hotel Pierre in Florence, good, were the others), this was the best. The location is great, right on the Grand Canal about five minutes walk from the Ponte Rialto. To get there from the International Airport, we walked 10 minutes from the Terminal to the Alilaguna ferry (40 Euro for 4, via Lido and Murano, however, and hour+ ride!), then got the #1 Vaporitti at San Marco (water bus - 20 Euro for 4), up the Grand Canal to Ca' d'Oro (House Of Gold). To the hotel is then just two minutes walk - to the main street, right, and first right at the square. On reflection, for four of us, a water taxi from the airport might have been cheaper, faster and more fun (EURO 44.95 from the airport to San Marco, I believe, after that I don't know). The main train station (Ferrovia) and the bus station are just a few vaporetto stops north up the Canal. Remember only the #1 stops at Ca' d'Oro. Apart from the nearby Vaporitti stop, you can cross the Grand Canal to the wonderful fresh fish and produce market (be there early), by traghetto (a gondola) for 50 cents, right outside the hotel. One of the better deals in Venice. I found the all the hotel staff friendly, personable and very helpful. They also knew our names and spoke excellent English, if that's important for you. The breakfasts were really quite good - something to look forward to, in fact. And the rooms and bathrooms were quite luxurious, with robes and good turndown service. The shower fittings were cool and techno, but large and somewhat over-complicated - it was a bit like sharing the shower with a white plastic robot. I liked being away from the gondola-crazy San Marco tourist melee, and in the morning I enjoyed early morning, cool-air walks north, into Cannnaregio, one of the more local areas of Venice. (Go towards the train station, then bear off right - Fondamente di Cannaregio, and Fondamente delle Cappucine, Ormesini, Misericordia and della Sensa are all fine canal-side walks, with cafes where you can get an early morning coffee. All are refreshingly tourist-free.) The hotel roof was kind of deserted when I was there, but I did see a nice mid-summer thunderstorm from there on our first night. The large room and the suite at the front of the hotel (overlooking the Grand Canal) appear to be really cool, but I was told you have to book them directly with the hotel.

We ate at one of them (Vini de Gigio), which is just down the street, and it was our best meal. When asking for restaurant suggestions be sure to ask to see the brochure - it's at the front desk in their restaurant folder. The best part of the hotel was the cost - only 180 euros per night.
