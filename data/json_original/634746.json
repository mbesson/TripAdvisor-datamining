I stayed here three nights and found the hotel clean with nice furniture and convenient to the Freeway, but quiet as well. There is a small pool and play area. The staff were friendly. The rate was good. Breakfast offered cereal, apples, OJ and muffins and toast. On the Con side, there was no coffee maker, fridge or microwave in the room, and just one issue of soap and shampoo (for the two of us, which I guess is OK but modest). There is coffee in the lobby which was a short walk from our room.", "Date": "December 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Grass Valley, CA", "Title": "\u201cThink twice before staying here\u201d", "Author": "HorridToad", "ReviewID": "UR91353012", "Content": "Motel has been recently partially refurbished but not finished. Photos are not accurate. Not close to Magic Mountain. Signs printed on white paper mark the floor numbers and elevator. Held in place with push pins and scotch tape. Rooms almost done but microwave and refrigerator removed leaving big holes. No hair dryer or shampoo. Bathroom very nice but faucets connected backwards, good bed. No reading light on one side. Entry door had tired feeling. Elevator more like a older freight elevator but worked OK. Strange door that could cover elevator on all floors. Had to go back down to get TV remote. Was told to bring back or it would cost $20. Would not give internet password at desk. Had to call down. Continental breakfast handed from back of reception counter in white bag. Contents OK with juice carton, apple, muffin. Reception study was small with a piece of plywood over false fireplace, no flowers, decorations, magazines, etc. Would have only given one star but the room was very clean with good mattress, nice shower/bath. Motel looks to be in financial difficulty and has strange vibes to it. Check-in parking spaces were blocked by highway cones and tired ones at that.", "Date": "January 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cDon't Waste Your Money\u201d", "Author": "DonnaNCrew", "ReviewID": "UR28397703", "Content": "We called and asked for two rooms next to each other as we were traveling with a group of 6 (big famiy). We were quoted one price and then charged another when we got there. Had to wait to get that resolved. Then we get to our room and find no washcloths in either room, one room had a bedspread with blood and urine on it!! We asked for that to be taken care of, and they changed the bedspread and gave us 1 washcloth for 6 people to use!!! The beds were not comfortable at all....one reviewer on thier site said they were the most comfortable ever....yeah, if you like sleeping on springs and pancakes for pillows. The TV's turn on, but don't come in clearly and the color fades in and out....out mostly. We left our stuff in the room when we went to Magic Mountain only to return and find that my son's NFL Jersey was taken from the room. We asked the maid if she saw it, she doesn't speak English. Told the front desk about it they said we had to talk to the morning crew. We spoke to morning crew who said there was nothing they could do about it and would call us if it shows up. Yeah right!!! We will never see that again. 2 rooms, 2 nights, all this mess and they still charged us almost $400.", "Date": "April 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Omaha, Nebraska", "Title": "\u201cbasic, clean and no frills\u201d", "Author": "huskertravelers", "ReviewID": "UR14081119", "Content": "We stayed in June of 2006 while going to magic mountain 6 flags.

Spent the day at Magic Mountain and called the hotel around 5pm to say we would be checking late that evening, I was assured this would not be a problem. Arrived around 10:30pm and the desk clerk has us checked in and on our way to our room in less than 3 minutes. My first thought was \"Wow, a hotel that actually remembered that I had a reservation\" Got to our room and my second thought was \"Wow, this is actually the room I reserved\". It was a non-smoking room, with one king bed, desk, TV stand/dresser combo, and 2 chairs. Looked like there had been a table in the room before, as it was quite a large room with an emply space where you would find a table in most rooms - I didn't miss the table and liked the nice open feeling of the room. The bedroom area and bathroom were spotless. Nice comfortable bed and pillows. The AC unit worked great. Even more nice surprises; FREE wireless internet in the room, cable TV (nice TV too), and phone numbers for Magic Mountain and a local Dominos Pizza that would delivery to the hotel room, free continental breakfast, and there was even coffee available in the lobby when we checked in. We had a room that faced the freeway but noise was not really noticible. They may have added insulating material to the walls since the last review. Paint and wallpaper looked very clean - might have been fairly new. The bathroom is all tile on the floors and walls and it was fresh and spotless. No mold/mildew or scum on the grout, shower curtain, or in the shower. Good water pressure and plenty of hot water. There were extra towels in the bathroom (5 regular bath towels plus hand towels and washcloths). The tip of the toilet paper was even folded with a fancy ruffle, not just the plain triangle you get most places :) There was only hand soap in the bathroom so bring your own shampoo etc.. but this wasn't a problem for us since I figured a \"budget\" hotel wouldn't supply that kind of stuff. Check out in the morning was under 1 minute. I would recommend this hotel to anybody planning on staying in the area. It took us about 20 minutes to get there from Magic Mountain and was very easy to find. I will be staying at this hotel the next time I am in the area.", "Date": "August 12, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Travelodge Sylmar/Magic Mountain Area", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g32655-d634746-Reviews-Travelodge_Sylmar_Magic_Mountain_Area-Los_Angeles_California.html", "Price": "$62 - $82*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">14955 Roxford St.</span>, <span class=\"extended-address\">Sylmar</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Los Angeles</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">91342</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "634746", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/d2/f6/d2f68ead308f3997d4fbb78efd3d8f9c4large.jpg"}}
