Hotel is located on Bleibtreustrasse; so take the left turn and its down on the right hand side, keep eye out, it is a very small sign. When we got inside ,staff were very friendly, room was very clean, small bathroom but vlean and rooms had very high ceilings[old victorian/georgian building]. Breakfast was brilliant a great variety and always full. Hotel has a lift and stairs. If staying at this hotel you have to try the italian restaurant and the other side of Bleibtreustrasse.

It has somewhat of a makeshift feel about it. My room was long and narrow with furniture awkwardly placed at one end and the beds at the other end. It was a bit dreary but provided a comfortable enough nights sleep and had all the requisite facilities. Impossible for wheelchair users because of short stairs in hallway up to reception and lift area. The breakfast room is very beautiful and magically decorated for winter/Christmas. There is a long centre table that looks set for an epic feast, and plenty of side tables. The location is salubrious, with nice restauarnts and shops close by, and it is within walking distance of the Zoologischer Garten railway station, which is served by Schonefeld Airport rail express and only costs \u20ac2.80!! I went to see the Christmas markets and there is one near to the hotel, and several others can be accessed via the hop-on, hop-off tourist buses which start off nearby on the Ku'damm. A taxi from airport costs about \u20ac36.

No friendly greeting, only shoulder shrugs and eye rolling. Definitely worst reception staff I have ever come across. Very heavy doors which made entry with luggage very unpleasant and difficult. One flight of steps (no lift) to reception also made things very difficult with luggage.

This hotel was a disaster though. It is very hard to say what was worst. The entrance is horrible (not that that is important), it's an old apartment building and on arrival you already become sad that you didn't make a reservation next door. On entering the hotel you are \"impressed\" by the dirty, uninviting feeling. The rooms are not at all like they are shown on the internet, they are wornout, small, oldfashioned and dirty. Your back will kill you every morning again on your crawl to the bathroom. if you finally reach it (not because of the size of the room, but because of the back injury!) you once again will be disappointed for spending your money for a louzy stay. Please avoid the staff, they will try to ruin your day with their \"friendly\" faces and their lack of service. If you have the nerve to go and ask for the Wifi password you will be surprised to receive it with a smile (....NOT!!!) after 20 minutes.

The elder breakfast lady is a very sweet and kind woman. The breakfast itself and the coffee were good. One gets bored with it after the 4th night but that's normal, that happens everywhere. It's location was very good too, right at the Ku'Damm and not too far from for example the Ged\u00e4chtniskirche. Berlin is huge so of course it was quite far from other 'to do's', which is normal for it's size. It was anyway a good idea to have the hotel near this very long shopping street, because the bags were getting heavy after a while. Now the bad list. The hotel is aged and I still wonder where they got the pictures they placed online. We got room 27 and we stayed there for 4 nights. It was a really small and unpleasant room that didn't have a relaxing atmosphere at all and that you wanted to escape from as soon as you stepped in. The bathroom was very small as well and the shower was very annoying to get out of and even a bit dangerous for slipping out because there is a very large step down. Between the end of the bed and the wall was 40 cm in space and the TV was hanging at the left of the bed in the corner where the bed was placed against. So your neck started hurting very much while looking at the tv and the person on the right wasn't able to see the tv at all. The 'twin' bed was a box with 2 matrasses in and the bed couldn't be put pulled into 2 pieces a twin should normally be able to. The matrasses were of no quality at all, not of age, just no support whilst sleeping so that; combined with the room getting really hot at night, resulted in 4 nights of hardly sleep and a very sour back. About the staff, I do not expect much, I don't even want those fake smiles at reception that so often hotelguest demand, I just want to be treated the same way as I treat people. What I do not like is being treated rudely. I went to reception 5 times in 4 days, the morning after the Sunday evening we checked in (that was 8.10 pm and we had to pick up the key in the other hotel). I stood there like an idiot, not like a paying guest, waiting for at least 10 minutes until the woman behind reception decided to put her personal call on hold (yes I do understand a bit of Russian) to see what I wanted. I just wanted to check in officially. Another time was for the code of the wireless. With dread I was given it. The 3rd time was on the last complete day that we were spending another night. I wanted to get a second key of the room because we were going our seperate ways (you even need the key during the day to get into the building). Instead of just getting the key we were told that we still had to pay for the first night (we made a prepaid for 3 nights then decided to add another night). I must admit I found this quite offensive as if I was a fraud because there was still a bill to be paid. We were checking out the next day and normally guest pay at check out, so this comment wasn't necessary for anything. The 4th time was the next day to check out and the last time was to pick up our luggage and ask for a taxi. In the hallway on the 2nd floor there was a foul smell throughout our stay, maybe airing the wallways wouldn't be a bad idea. To conclude, I really didn't like the place and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I think this place should be called a hotel at all. In my opinion this place is a total rip off. However I didn't let all this spoil my holiday and I must say I am impressed with Berlin and I very much enjoyed being a Berliner for 4 days.", "Date": "July 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cWhat a great surprise!\u201d", "Author": "Nataleigh", "ReviewID": "UR12821840", "Content": "Wow - we couldn't have imagined for anything better.

A beautiful balcony from our window overlooking the main street, and the bathroom was just immaculate! Probably the cleanest bathroom I had ever seen in my life. The one down side would be the beds... it was two singles pushed together and normally you can live with this, there was a big piece of wood in the middle so there was no chance of a cuddle in the night.
