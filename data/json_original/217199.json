Check in was real easy and the front desk people were great.That being said the room was something out of an old motel 6. Beds were shoved as close to the door as possible to allow room for fridge and cooktop. Cracks in walls throughout and just an overall not clean feel and smell to the place. 2 queen bed room with only 1 chair in the place. Closet door were removed and old wire shelves put up around the room helped and tio the cheap feel.

Rooms are basic, functional, and clean. My room was a one bedroom studio with a large bed, fully equipped kitchen with stove (no regular oven), microwave, and refrigerator, with a large breakfast bar that also doubled as a work desk. The only issue I encountered is that there as a mild, funky smell when I entered the room - smelled a bit like spoiled milk. I checked but could not find a source for the smell, but since I was only going to be there one night, it didn't matter. Looking at some of the other recent reviews, I didn't encounter any of the issues that others have reported. I did not use the wireless internet service (there is an extra charge for it), since I bring my own mobile wi-fi hotspot. Hotel is convenient to I-17. Note - If you book this hotel, be sure to check out the brand's website, as various discounts (AAA, senior, weekend specials) are available. If you're a first time visitor to the website, you can sometimes snag an additional $10 off the quoted rates.", "Date": "November 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Mexico", "Title": "\u201csmelly & dirty\u201d", "Author": "RoadrunnersNewMexico", "ReviewID": "UR98442985", "Content": "I booked a non-smoking suite SEVEN weeks in advance, yet they had none when we checked in.

The bathroom floor was sticky and dirt was in the corners. There was no lock mechanism in the bathroom door, just door knobs. Blue nail polish was splattered on the bathroom wall and waste basket.

First room the key didnt work (sound familar) then when he was able to access the room the bed wasnt made and the room was dirty. The second room he was given looked like a cancun party had been there with a razor blade left on the nightstand.

Cozy & clean, TV, kitchen area with large bar and stools, large refr. full stove, Microwave, coffeepot, cabinet area stocked with with dishes and cookware, cabinet drawers stocked with utensils for eating & cooking. Very large bathroom. Could live there and be very comfortable. We will be making this our place to stay when going to the valley. Much cheaper then taking our 5th wheel, I realize this read as a paid advertisement & believe me if I read it, I would also think so.

I had to get clean sheets as they had not been changed either. The people working there were very nice and helpful, but no help should have been needed. There was also mold all over the bathroom in abundance. I had to go out and buy clorox clean-up to kill it.
