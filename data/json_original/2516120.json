The rooms are quite large, I guess LA-size!. The bathroom by itself is almost as large as a hotel room I stayed in during a visit to Rome! Room was relatively clean, no complaints about that. Breakfast was limited, but still OK for a hotel like this. To name all items offered: Bagels, toasts, creals and Milk, buttter, jam, honey, and coffee. Our only complaint was that there was no cheese of any type available. The only negative comment. There was some noise from the neighboring rooms late at night (~3 am), and also early in the morning (~6 am). I always carry my earplugs when I travel, so the noise was not a major issue. BTW, I rated 'Service' as Average above, since we did not ask for any particular service.

It is set up in a fort style with one entry -- a two story building surrounding the parking lot. The staff was friendly. We opted for the king size bed, which was very comfortable, but tight for the room. The facility is definitely older, but had fresh paint outside, upgraded tile in the bathroom adn was clean. There was also a microwave and small refrigerator. We were on the upper floor, which was quiet. There was also a walk in closet, The heater was a little noisey during the night, but an adjustment on the dial set that right. The continental breakfast was modest, but adequate, with cereal, instant oatmeal, muffins and danish, eggo waffles, toast and juice -- no fruit.

So much better than the luxury hotel where I stayed for two nights (immediately after, on someone else's dime). Easy to find-- neighborhood looks sketchy, but had no problems. Very central to the things I needed to do (in Pasadena, Silverlake, Hollywood, and Downtown). Free parking! The manager was extremely courteous and friendly when I arrived. The room was huge and clean enough-- a few stains on the carpet, but no more than in my own living room. Mini-fridge in the room, free internet. I could hear some noise from neighboring rooms from time to time (folks above having sex), but nothing I haven't heard just as often in fancier places. Great breakfast for free in the mornings, lots of choices (cereal, pastries, fruit, juice, etc.). I opted to carry my food back to my room, rather than eat in the lobby. Check-out was very easy.

Since I charged it to Discover card when they were offering 5% cashback for travel and made the reservation from hotels.com [preferred online partner] through the discover card website, I got an additional about 4% cashback from Discover card. So I ended up paying net about $118 including tax, which is a decent deal for LA where hotels tend to be expensive and this rate included a free, basic breakfast. As others have pointed out, parking space is tight and entry is narrow so drive carefully. Hotel was only about half full so I did not have parking problem This is an older property so come with realistic expectations. The mattress was somewhat saggy, and as several others have pointed out, the carpet is old and dingy. The rooms and bathrooms are small but sink is outside bathroom so if there are two of you, that may be convenient. The bathroom tile and bathtub seem to be redone recently but the water control for shower head is finicky going from hot to cold very quickly. Hotel only provides soap, shampoo and towels so bring other toiletries. Old CRT TV but reasonably large size squeezed in corner; good part is about 66 cable channels including HBO As Super8 website says, every room has old fridge and old microwave but they worked fine. The furniture [table, chairs, dresser] are old and rather dingy but worked OK. Window AC unit seems new and worked fine without excessive noise. Sink had one blown light bulb but I got a new one from reception. One lamp above dresser did not work. Manager lives onsite and was friendly, cooperative and helpful with directions as was the receptionist. I asked for room not on Huntington Dr or Poplar so would not be disturbed by traffic noise and manager cheerfully and readily accommodated me. Basic breakfast with bread, two types of cereal, muffins, danish, coffee, orange juice, milk. Frozen waffles on Saturday but not on Friday. Area around motel did not seem very safe so be careful after dark Gas station opposite motel Has WIFI but I did not use; has computer with internet connection in lobby [$5/hour] All in all, this is a reasonable choice for those on a limited budget.

The room had a hole in one wall; you could see outside, people could see inside, and bugs could come in and out. I told the woman at the front desk that there was hole all the way through the wall. She responded, \u201cI know, all the rooms are like that. We\u2019re getting internet.\u201d I asked her, \u201cWell, we\u2019re in the room right now, what can you do about it?\u201d She said, \u201cHere, stick this in it.\u201d And handed me a washcloth. 2. Inside the room graffiti was carved into all of the light fixtures, the air conditioning unit, and into the wooden furniture. 3. The bathroom door had what looked like dried food all over it. The bathroom fixtures were rusted and the floor was incredibly sticky both days we were there. 4. The carpet was filthy and literally turned the bottom of our socks black. We ended up wearing shoes the entire time we were there and would not walk on the carpet. 5. The sheets were clean but the top sheet had a blood stain towards the top and in a visible location. We were given clean sheets but were still disgusted by the stain. 6. All of the walls were filthy, the furniture didn\u2019t match, the bottom of one of the chairs was ripped and sagging to the ground, the refrigerator never cooled enough to keep our food from spoiling., most of the TV stations did not get good reception, and all of the furniture looked like it came from a thrift store. 7. We had been gone all day the second day we were there. We arrived at the hotel room around 3pm, hot, tired, and in need of a shower. I went to take a shower and discovered there were no towels. I asked the housekeeper in the next room where the towels were. She did not speak one word of English so I went to the front desk, inquired about the towels, and was told by the woman at the front desk, \u201cThe towels are in the wash.\u201d I said, \u201cAll of the towels are in the wash? Don\u2019t you have any extras?\u201d She said there were no extra towels. I asked when they would be ready, to which she replied, \u201cThey\u2019re in the wash now so whenever they\u2019re done we\u2019ll put them in the dryer and when they\u2019re done in the dryer they\u2019ll be ready.\u201d 8. The continental breakfast was OK. The only problems with the breakfast was: long black hairs all over the apples and their idea of breakfast, which on Sunday consisted of Twinkies and Ding Dongs. 9. We were told when making the reservation that the rooms all had hair dryers, iron, and ironing board. Our room had NOTHING! 10. There was a homeless lady with a shopping cart \u201cliving\u201d in one of the parking spaces. 11. One of the housekeepers was washing the sidewalk and sprayed the entire back of our car, which we had just had washed and detailed, with water. We couldn\u2019t believe it when we saw her do it.
