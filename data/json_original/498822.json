We stayed one night in this room but were then given a room at the back on the 3rd floor which not only had a sea view over the rooftop of the buildings in the back street but had no outside noise at all. This was perfect. The room was sparsely furnished in a modern style with big TV but quite adequate and the bathroom had an excellent walk-in shower (no bath) which was a life-saver after the cold wet days - there were plenty of towels and toiletries provided. I agree, that the staff are very helpful and polite. The breakfast was good with lots of choice - eggs could be ordered freshly cooked with limitless tea and coffee plus cuppuccino machine - the restaurant also had an excellent view of the mosque opposite.

Second, check that the windows in your room are closed when you check in. If they aren't, the aircon won't turn on. And, you may find it very noisy. We spent a night feeling hot and stuffy before realising the problem. The cleaners open the windows for ventilation when they clean the room, so you need to remember to close them again.

First impression - we were a little worried that we had to go down an escalator to get to the hotel but once we got through the hotel doors we were rapt with what we saw. Check in was smooth, porters were quick to grab our bags and get them to the rooms. The rroms were clean and well decorated (not that interior design is high on our list of priorities when travelling). There is a mosque directly across the road, so the call to prayer was quite loud but we found that we quickly got used to it. the 5am one is a wake up call, but we quickly went back to sleep as it only lasts a minute (added to our Turkish experience). With the overnight stay at Gallipoli - as we didn't want to lug suitcases across Turkey we enquired as to booking a room for that night (which we hadn't done). Not a problem. So all our bags including travel companions went into that room and off we went. Breakfast was great with a wide selection of foods. The only complaint was that the coffee machine wasn't working properly (not hot enough and only half filled cups) and the hot chocolate was unavailable for the kids! Not to worry - coffee came around with the staff so all good! Plenty of room in the restaurant although there was o tour group there on our last day and the tables were starting to run out. ON tour groups - whilst the foyer area is adequate - when there are lots of people trying to get checked in at the same time, it can become crowded as they mill around the desk - this says more about the ignorance of some travellers as it was difficult to get through the crowd to get to the elevators. Perhaps tour guides can organise their groups to stand away from the access area so as not to inconvenience others staying at the hotel. The Spa/Hamam was fantastic although we went in there with our two daughters which was a little awkward when confronted with naked men. I think bathing suits should be a must if children are allowed in. Some adults also find public nudity confronting so consideration whould be given to this!

It is a modern hotel, but the layout is different than any other hotel I ever stayed in. It is located right on one of the busiest streets in the historic part of Istanbul The street has 4 traffic lanes and 2 tram tracks down the center. There is a lot of street noise. The front of the hotel looks like a streetside business office, no different than all the business around it. Only the sign on the glass indicates it is a hotel. When you enter, you are in a multistory atrium housing a shoe store, a jeweller, and two banks. In front of you is an escalator which takes you down to the hotel bar, restaurant, and the entry to the check-in area. Everything is marble or steel. The rooms are large, or at least ours were because we paid extra for something they call \"double used as a single\", meaning they had a double bed or two singles pushed together. Ample for two single people sleeping separately. An extremely comfortable bed, but the other furniture was sparse. Low luminosity fluourescent enrgy-saver lightbulbs made it very difficult to read and generally gloomy. The bathrooms are spacious, and there is a large closet and storage cabinet with a (small capacity) safe. There were sufficient soaps and shampoos, and everything was clean and the bedrooms were nicely carpeted. Nice big towels, but they weren't replaced daily. There was a flat screen TV, but in my room it only got European channels. My daughter got American channels as well. You don't know how much you'll miss American channels, if you're an American, until you have to watch Al Jazeera or Italian bicycle races in Italian, or Polish and German talk TV. The breakfast was really extensive, table upon table with eggs, breads, cerals, sweet baked goods, rolls, yogurts, juices and many other good things. It could be the biggest meal of the day if you wanted it to be. The restaurant has a good view of the Beyazit Mosque across the boulevard and it's quite a pleasant place to eat. As has been said by others, it is located about two short blocks from to a tram stop and also to one of the entrances to the Grand Bazaar. It's not as close to the Blue Mosque or Topkapi as I would have liked, at least a 15 minute walk or more, but you can take the very frequent trams to get there. All in all it's in a good but not outstanding location, but there is no reason to complain. If you pay extra you can get a room with a view of the mosque across the street. If you don't want to pay extra, there is a good chance your room will look down into the atrium with the escalator, and that is an ugly view. I noticed in the photos online that the busy street was right in front of the hotel rooms, so I requested to have the Marmara View instead. That means you'll be on the other side of the hotel and it's much quieter there. The view is pleasant, but there are a couple of rundown buildings right in front of your rooms that you'll be looking at. Still it's your best choice. They only have two rooms with the Marmara view, so request them specifically, 323 and 324. I think you could request that side of the hotel but without the extra fee Marmara view, but you'll be looking right into the windows of a sweatshop and other things. They were very good to give me those rooms when I asked for them. In fact the staff were very pleasant and willing to help in every way they could. So there's really not anything to complain about, as long as you request the right rooms, but the overall feel of this hotel is cold. Industrial, I guess you could say. Or maybe \"functional\" is the right word. I don't want to give the wrong impression, if you stay here you won't kick yourself, but I just think for a tourist making his or her first visit to Istanbul you might be better off in a more traditional hotel located a little bit closer to Aya Sofya and the Blue Mosque. Last year I stayed at the Adamar Hotel, and I would have stayed there this year but it was fully booked. I recommend you check on that.

We would stay her again There is a basic local restaurant near by called Istanbul International with good food/value. Take first street on right hand side after the tram stop and walk down the street (maybe gedik pasa street), the restaurant is on right hand side.

However, we waited until a week before we left to book and all prices shot up - doubling in some cases. We found the Barcelo Saray and it looked pretty good. The reviews on tripadvisor sounded great too so we gave it a shot. Location... The hotel is in the old part of town and is perfectly located for seeing the Grand Bazaar, the Hagia Sofia, the Blue Mosque etc. You're within walking distance of all the major sites - and the sea too. The hotel's website makes the claim that it's 200m from the Grand Bazaar - I think it's way closer actually (even better). The tram is right in front of the hotel and you're not bang in the middle of a tourist trap so the taxis won't rip you off. The hotel is around 30 minutes from the airport, which was easy. We stayed 3 nights so qualified for the free airport pickup which was awesome. On the way back the taxi cost YTL30. Facilities... The hotel has such a strange lay-out, but it is pretty good. Some of the rooms face inwards and their windows open into a central, covered courtyard. Glad we didn't have one of these. We were at the back of the hotel and faced the street behind. The views from the front of the hotel are much better. Food... A buffet breakfast is included, but was quite disappointing. It tried to be more than a continental breakfast but let itself down I think. We arrived at around 10 each morning and most of the hot selection had ran out. The hot food choices were quite strange too (noodles with meat, deep fried bread, boiled egg, fried egg, etc). However, I'm comparing this to places we visit in Thailand each year - hotels I'd visit just for the amazing breakfasts! Realistically speaking the food was good. Staff... The staff were great. They were all really helpful and friendly. They should come to London and train our hotels... Rooms... Our room was a good size. It was really clean and modern. The minibar was well-stocked (although expensive... the cans aren't marked so you can replace them if you need to). The bed was comfortable. The bathroom was huge... and modern. There were plenty of channels available on TV, but when we turned ours on, it was always on full volume - very strange. Noise... We were in a room at the back of the hotel and it was really quiet. The whole hotel seemed like it was empty - which it wasn't. No noise problems here at all! Decor... I liked the overall feel of the hotel. The colour scheme was good. I liked the carpets quite a lot. Guests... The hotel seems to cater for tourists from Spain and Portugal, however, everything was in English - and the staff spoke more English than anything else. There were a few groups from Spain when we were there - and a big one from the US. However, the groups weren't too much and the majority of guests were couples or families. One last thing... We're a gay couple and were given a double bed without even asking for it. At no point in the registration process do I remember requesting one either. This was a really nice surprise - not something I expected! I hadn't heard of the Bacelo chain before, and they were heavily into promoting all their other properties around the hotel.

The hotel is situated on a very busy main throughfare in the Beyazit district. Come out of the hotel entrance and turn right. Carry on down the main road and in 10-15 minutes' time, you'll be in the Sultanahmet district where most of the main historical sites are: the Blue Mosque, the Aya Sofia, the Hippodrome, the Archaeological Museum, the Topkapi Palace and the Basilica Cistern are all within minutes of each other within the Sultanahmet region. But be warned, the Beyazit district is much cheaper when it comes to eating out and plenty of excellent restaurants can be found down the steep side streets on the hotel side of the main road. You'll also find plenty of cafes and eating places on the main road as you head into Sultanahmet, although the price may rise accordingly. Across the road from the hotel entrance is the Grand Bazaar, a madhouse filled with hundreds of shops selling all the things you never knew you needed (or wanted)! Trams run along this main road, and you'll often see buses and taxis whizzing around, which makes the hotel location handy for transport links. Breakfast at the Barcelo Saray is the usual continental fare: fruit juices (cordials, not freshly squeezed), cereal, cold meats, salad, a very small selection of hot food, and plenty of bread. It's served inside a restaurant on the rooftop so you are treated to a beautiful view of the nearby Ottoman baroque-style mosque across the street. The hotel also houses a sauna and steam room, free to guests, plus the opportunity for a hamam experience (at cost). You can request airport-hotel transfer by e-mailing the hotel beforehand unless you book your stay through them directly. Although other reviewers were charged 30 lira for the transfer, we were charged a whopping 43 lira each way on our visit. Although, it must be said, the hotel driver assigned to us was wonderful and very friendly and welcoming. Unfortunately for us, we did not find the hotel staff particularly friendly. Although language was a barrier for us, we smiled as we communicated but almost every member of staff we interacted with, whether on reception or in the restaurant, was off-hand. Not sure if it was because we were Chinese (although from the UK), because we noticed other guests of Spanish, German etc origin seemed to receive more helpful and attentive service than us. Perhaps it all went downhill when we the porter first took our luggage to the room and we didn't have any change at the beginning of our holiday to tip him on the spot! Of course, it may just be a cultural factor (we had similar experiences of 'indifference' in restaurants and venues outside of the hotel) or a misperception on our part. However, the hotel staff offered an efficient, clinical service that was adequate to our needs. Communication in English was minimal, but the hotel has no problem attracting guests of varying nationalities. Barcelo Saray offers good basic room facilities: hairdryer, generous shower room (no bath in ours), TV, fridge, electronic safe, quiet environment. On the minus side, no tea/coffee making facilities, few toiletries including cotton buds and make-up pads but no bathrobe or slippers. The decor is clean and minimalist. The carpet in our room was grotty and in need of a steam-clean, but the furniture and bedding was spotless. Overall, the location is excellent. The steam and sauna rooms are a bonus and the rooms are quiet. These factors made it an above average stay for me, although the room facilities make this hotel more of a good 3-star than 4-star.

Maybe it is just me: these folks are chain smokers. People smoke anywhere and everywhere, including during breakfast, without any hint of consideration for others. The smoking was a major minus, probably the only minus. WIFI high speed connection was free in the room: finally the FIRST hotel in Europe with a free internet connection. Miracle. The room was standard, with an inside view. Super quiet. The AC was neverthless extremely noisy. It smelled cigarette smoke as I doubt the previous tenants cared much about the non-smoking sign. Much of the building/rooms/public areas looked fresh and new. The staff was fine. You will have to deal with the Turkish mindset whereby everything is a haggling match/game. The porter ordered a taxi for us. When we asked him for the price to the airport, it was 30 Liras. When the taxi arrived, it changed to 35 Liras. Most of what you will encounter is petty: street vendor selling bread sticks for 50 cents lira but will try to get 75 cents from you. Haggling is a game in Istanbul. It is about how much a vendor can apply price elasticity to every single customer. It is PRICELINE.COM but outdoors!!! *smile* Don't get offended. Nothing personal. They now seem to have thousands of Ukrainian and Russian customers all too willing to buy not one shirt or 2 pairs of shoes but by the dozen. I guess they resell the bulk back home at a handsome profit. I would go back to this hotel on my next visit. It gives you the feelign you are in the middle of everything. November weather was awesome. I could not stand the Summer heat in this town. Hotel has AC though. There is a hammam downstairs which we never used. The TV is worthless and we had no time to watch it: too much to do outdoors. The breakfast was ok. Inclusive of the price we paid. The juices were awful: chemical taste. It was a typical breakfast you'd find at a spanish hotel in Spain. Again, decent but nothing to be amazed about. There is a safe in the room. There is also a fridge you can use to store your drinks. We paid 80 Euros a night. By the way, the USD has basically lost all respect! Merchants would rather take Euros. Be careful about the multitude of quotes in different currencies. You have to juggle USD/EUR/Lira constantly to ensure no one takes advantage of you. I have a dream: a fair price clearly advertised by all vendors in Turkey. I think we would h ave spent another $2000 were the vendors more honest in their pricing.", "Date": "November 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Pasadena,Ca", "Title": "\u201cA travel Experience\u201d", "Author": "tripSouthPasadena_Ca", "ReviewID": "UR10363830", "Content": "After Mykonos we flew to Istanbul, Thanks to Ender, our travel agent at Kivoto's Aegean Agency he had set us up at the \"Barcelo saray Hotel\". His planning couldn't have been better, he took care of every detail to our satisfaction. The transfers in each city to our hotels were prompt and with courteous and helpful people.The hotel was fantastic, centrally located and right across from the Blue Mosque. The rooms were a bit small but the service was superb. They have an excellent retaurant \"the Vista\" on the top floor which is very elegant with an excellent and tasty menu and it has huge picture windows that overlook the Blue Mosque. It is very impressive at night all lit up. We enjoyed the Call to prayer throughout the day. The best part of the hotel is that it was very close to all the historical sights in the city. And shopping! I couldn't stay out of the Grand Bazaar especially because it was so close to the hotel I could make several trips back and forth. This is a city we will also visit again ,Ender, it was great!", "Date": "October 27, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Barcelo Saray", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d498822-Reviews-Barcelo_Saray-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$105 - $221*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Yeniceriler cad. 85</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Istanbul</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">34130</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Turkey</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "498822", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/d2/b5/d2b52f20651ac434399284c2709920b65large.jpg"}}
