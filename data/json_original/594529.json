The hotel itself is really disappointing, the rooms are not very clean, the ensuites in the rooms are horrible (there is no separation between shower and the rest of the bathroom, so when you take a shower, the whole bathroom is flooded!!). The worst is definitely the staff: very rude and not at all helpful!", "Date": "Mar 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR835405338", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "julie216"}, {"Content": "Disappointing Although the area was good, the hotel itself was very disappointing. It didn't seem that the room had been cleaned very well before I checked in and the bathroom was extremely small. On the first day, my toilet stopped flushing. I told the front desk first thing the next morning and when I returned to my room that night at 8p, the staff had just gotten to my room to look at it. They worked on it for a few minutes and then claimed that they couldn't fix it, and left. My toilet didn't flush for my entire time there - it was smelly and disgusting. I was very happy when my stay there was over.", "Date": "Jan 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR981082583", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "onebigvacationayear"}, {"Content": "Not bad Not great Qualities-* One of the cheapest places I've found to stay in Sydney* Reasonable if you're just looking for a roof on top of your head* My room was an en-suite- had a shower, toilet, sink, kettle, fan and wardrobe. All rooms are non-smoking. * The morning reception staff was friendly and you can store your luggage after check-out. * Kings Cross station is 7 mins walk and the bus stop is close by which takes you to Oxford Street and Central. Traits* The WORST thing about this hotel is that it was unbelievably cold. There are no carpets in the room and you will freeze despite how many layers of blanket you put over you. I bought a heater from the nearby Woolworths for $20. I'm sure this won't be much of a problem if you go during Spring and Winter* Your room will not be cleaned everyday....you need to request for it to be and even then it won't be everyday. * The shower isn't that great.....it dribbles out water* Not renovated as mentioned on website but they did start painting the building as I leftConclusion-Not a bad place to stay on a budget. It's quiet and not a backpackers hostel. I don't regret staying here. Remember you need to buy a heater if you're staying during autumn and winter as it will be extremely cold.Email me- sussexstudent@yahoo.co.uk if you require any further information on Sydney and Challis Lodge", "Date": "Jul 10, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR481221363", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "sussexstudent"}, {"Content": "Terrible I stayed there for 5 days and it seemed really long.

We first stayed in a non balcony room somewhere at the back which was very small and not nice at all. We then changed to a balcony room which is 15$ more per night, but it`s worth it. But still it`s nothing special but basic.The brochure says that the Lodge was recently refurbished which is hard to believe. At least the two rooms we have seen didn`t look refurbished at all.I agree with other reviews that the photos on the homepage do not reflect reality. The location of the Lodge is very good to explore Sydney. Potts Point is a nice area with trendy cafes and restaurants. It`s about 20 minutes walking time to the city center and harbour.There is a bus stop around the corner and Kings Cross train station is about 7 minutes walking time.", "Date": "Aug 28, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR733698808", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "chris-austria"}, {"Content": "Awful Booked the room for a week and stayed 3 days- that was too long. The room was tiny, scruffy and cold. ( used a hairdryer to heat it up) Mustard yellow paint with no pictures on walls. Bedding clean. The bathroom was also tiny with a shower that soaked everything else in the room and a cistern that constantly filled up so i ended up doing some plumbing!The staff at reception were less than friendly. Never looked up as you passed or gave you the time of day which added to the overall inhospitable atmosphere.Ignore the photos on website- they were taken somewhere else.

Our first stop was Sydney and chose the challis lodge as the picture price and area attracted us. I would advise nobody stay at this lodge as the photo on the web site must be from another hotel as our room was old, cold, damp and tiny. The windows would not work and permantly open, and as the weather was cold and raining it was not pleasant, the shower dripped - no water came through - a single wardrobe - small table - not enough room for two as so small - they had fitted a threequarter bed in the room as a double bed would not have fitted - I ended up very poorly with a chest infection as the room was so damp and cold - we had to air our clothes with an hairdryer - would recommend to see the room first and you might get the one on the picture which looks very nice!!!!", "Date": "Jun 26, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR971312710", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Nice building, nice area . Good value for your $$ or \u9227\ue0fd\u5053 Hey to all OZ lovers and travelers,I spent 9 days in Sydney back in April / May and I loved the city!!!! I Will go back next Spring and I will certainly stay at the same place because , eventhough the room was only average, the location in Challis Avenue is quiet, quaint, nice, lively and secure.I had booked a double room for one person but I finally opted for a triple room with balcony because the rooms I were shown were really tacky and somehow filthy....The room on the first floor featured a double bed and a single one with a nice view onto Challis. i loved the cockatoes paying me a visit in the morning while I was having Breakfast, and I loved the smell of the exotic trees lined up in Challis...:-)Well, I paid A$ 450 for 7 nights including GST , which is a little under \u9227?270.00. It's really a great price and you can easily forgive those little  drawbacks  that can sometimes bother or even ruin your stay...Ok, the wallpaper was old and decaying, the floor was dirty, the shower was leacking and the flush would only flush once a day but there was a fridge and a view worse the money. Sydnersiders are laid back people and I really felt almost at home there. I love Europe but Australia is certainly next to Euroe the only place where I would love to stay and may be live.Thanks for the great stay and if you do book a room at Challis or the Springfieldse, u the Challis web side because the price you will pay at any Hotel[--] or other webside WILL be dearer!!! Feel free to write back. I would love to meet new friends and never know...have a good time Donwunder next time I visit.OZ and other OZ lovers and travelers aged 30 to 48 feel free to conenct.Let's chat and exchange.CheersPascal-Pierre SaunierLa Ville au SangFrance-22130 CorseulEuropean Unionmail: PP22130@aol.com", "Date": "Jun 7, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR972252330", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Peter22130"}, {"Content": "Not as good as in the photos Lock on the door didn\u9e93t work, was grubby, shower only lets out a few drops of water.
