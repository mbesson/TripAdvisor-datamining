Superior room bed was smaller than a Queen, and there was about 1.5 feet on each side of the bed, a tiny desk, an armoir closet which was in the way and a 1-person-at-a-time bathroom - however it did have a nice view and good light from the two french-door windows which looked out over Rue Saint-Bon, a one-block long street with very little traffic. Standard Twin room was definitely larger, with much more room around the beds... it had a cute little (albeit nonworking) fireplace and one small window which looked out onto a wall about 3 feet away - very dark room, and absolutely no view. The bath was slightly smaller, no way more than 1 person at a time in the bathroom. Even though the decor was not particularly to my liking, both rooms and bathrooms were clean. The maids refold dirty towels and put them back on the towel rack, even when they are wet and dirty. They will bring new ones, however you have to ask for them in the morning - I guess they get locked up at night! They don't change sheets while you are occupying the room unless YOU remove the sheets and put them on the floor (?!?). Teeny-tiny elevator, send your bags up and you take the stairs! Breakfast was boring - mediocre coffee, same croissants, bread, boiled eggs (do-it-youself) canned fruit, yogurt and foil-wrapped, processed cheese EVERY SINGLE DAY - no variation what so ever. For 9 euros, you can do better within a block or two - unless you are just in a hurry, it is very convenient. Front desk staff was very, very helpful (if you could catch them NOT on the phone), happy to make dinner reservations, help with Metro questions, etc. They have a computer (stand up to use it) for guests' use, and a good selection of maps and tourist information readily available. The hotel is very conveniently located 1 block from the Hotel De Ville Metro stop and four blocks from the Chatelet Metro stop. You can walk to the Latin Quarter or the Louvre in less than 10 minutes easily. The Marais is full of fun little restaurants and bars, quite a few in less than 5 minute walk. If you are on a budget, and would rather spend your $$$ on other things besides the hotel while in Paris, the Hotel Andrea Rivoli would be an excellent choice. Just don't make plans to stay here expecting robes and slippers and chocolates on your (hard) pillow every night - not going to happen!", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and reasonable price\u201d", "Author": "modesttraveller30s", "ReviewID": "UR120587865", "Content": "This is the second time I've stayed in this hotel and I enjoyed it on both occasions.

The hotel is very well located on the edge of the lively Marais area, a few minutes walk from the Hotel de Ville, Ile de la Cite, the Pompidou Centre and the Louvre. Very close to metro stations at Hotel de Ville and Chatelet, which is only seven stops from Gare du Nord for the Eurostar. The rooms although not large and with relatively limited storage space are clean and comfortable. Our room (103) overlooked rue Saint Bon but the double glazing meant the room was quiet with very little noise from the nearby rue de Rivoli. The bathroom had a good sized and very efficient shower. The flat screen TV certainly had BBC World in English and I believe some other English language channels (although we spent very little time watching TV)! Breakfast at 9 euros was reasonable value and included juice, yogurt, fruit, croissants & preserves, mini pain au chocolat, small bread rolls, processed cheese, eggs and an egg boiler, toast, coffee and tea. Service at breakfast and throughout the hotel was friendly and efficient at all times (although some staff do not speak English and speaking a little French certainly helps). My only criticism of the hotel was the quality of the wi-fi signal, which in our room was weak, variable and sometimes non-existent. That is the only reason that this is a four star and not a five star review. However, please remember that this is a small two star hotel in Paris and structure expectations accordingly!

We were aware of all these, and more or less we found what we expected for 102 euro (classic double) for a week in May 2011. What we did not expect are the following: a) The wi-fi in our room (second floor) was either not working at all or was very, very slow. Having to send reports to our magazine everyday we had a really hard time. b) The hotel was in the process of intense renovation, in other words people were working the whole day (8.00-17.00) and the front of the hotel was covered by scaffolding. Nobody informed us about this in advance and there was no relevant indication in the web site. c) The noise (drilling, hammering, banging, hitting etc.) was terrible. When returning late (15.00) for a little rest, after a 6 hour strolling in the city, we could not stay for a moment, so we had to leave and find refuge in a nearby park or garden. d) The only view from our balcony, \"overlooking\" rue Saint Bon, was the scaffolding, the balcony floor was full of dust and debris and sometimes the workers were outside our window. The combination of noise, dirt and human presence made it impossible to open the window; worse, sometimes we had to draw our curtains to protect our privacy; worse still, one day, when we tried to open our window, we were told by a worker that the floor of the balcony needed to be left to dry up, because it was just cemented. In the hot days life in the room was simply unbearable. Imagine a dark room (lighting in the room unacceptable) and two people either leaving it in terror or waiting patiently until 17.00 for the workers to stop, unable to relax or work. We were extremely distressed not being able to feel comfortable in our room and having to walk around Paris from morning till late in the afternoon to avoid the noise and generally the unpleasant conditions. e) We complained from the first day to the staff in the reception and the only thing we managed, apart from earning their sympathy, was to hear that they were very very sorry. We sent two detailed email messages to the hotel manager, but to no avail. Only a short note from the reception that they were again very sorry, that they understand our problems, but nothing could be done. f) Before departure we insisted that, since we did not get what we paid for, the least the hotel should do as a symbolic gesture was to reduce the rate from 102 to 95 euro, that is, to the cost of a room not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153overlooking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the street but seeing to the yard. The manager never appeared, but, through the person in the reception, informed us that the full amount will be immediately withdrawn from our credit card!

There are many beautiful sights, lots of walking, and some wonderfully friendly French people. We selected Andrea Rivoli for one week for a few reasons: cost, location, free WI-FI. The location was okay, close enough to Chatelet and Hotel de Ville Metro, on the far reaches of the cool Le Marais area and in walking distance to the Louvre. The hotel is on a seemingly abandoned side street, away from the noise of Rue Rivoli. The cost was okay, a 2 star hotel for 102 Euros a night. I tried to reserve 10 other hotels but those were fully booked because of a fashion trade show. The continental breakfast was an extra 8.5 Euros. We chose the pastry shops - quiche/sandwiches/croissants/juice - for less. The room and bathroom were small, but we managed. However, the bed gave us muscle aches because the mattress felt like there was absolutely no cushioning, almost like a box spring. We woke up with back and neck aches every day. Our view outside was of a wall. We opted for 2 twin beds, as opposed to a double because we are Americans used to sharing a king size bed. There was a lift, which bypassed us if there was already someone else on there. We were 5 floors up and the spiral staircase looked intimidating. It was crucial that we had wi-fi, for work and to plan our day. However, I could almost never load a website page though I lucked out with email about 75% of the time. No one at the front desk could help us. Some of the staff insisted that no one else had this problem, and others said the internet connection wasn't consistent. Though, when I needed to check my email one night and it didn't work, one of the staff members was kind enough to let me use the front computer. Another time, the staff member wanted me to pay to use the computer, but finally allowed us free access. By the way, I am writing this email from Bruge, the same day we left Paris. I'm having no problems, at all, with my computer here. One final comment. We needed a taxi to the train station as we had heavy bags, not something you want to deal with more than once on the metro. The night staff member was challenged with finding a taxi for us in the morning. When we left in the morning, we had found out that a shuttle was ordered for us - 35 Euros instead of 12 with a taxi.

The manager/owner made that mistake, would not acknowledge it, refused to move us to a standard room, or to lower the price to what we had originally tried to book. She was rude and would not acknowledge her error, insisting it was our fault, stating things like'we are so much cheaper than North American hotels', to which I responded, 'you should visit North America, and see what you can get for 115E($180). Besides, that had nothing to do with the issue, for we love Paris and the area, and the hotel was absolutely fine. She refused to understand and blamed it on her staff that they should not have guaranteed that room. But, she has trained her staff, who by the way did not understand why we were not given that room. It had been handwritten, attached to our reservation, that #504 was for us and could not be changed.

The hotel room was all that we wanted it to be (and a little more with two gorgeous 'Parisienne' balconies that we would sit and people watch first thing in the morning). We stayed in Room 604 and we certainly weren't disappointed. The room was furnished with a decent sized double bed, small table and chairs and the ensuite bathroom wasn't as tiny as many other hotel bathrooms in Europe. So we were very pleased indeed. This was our first visit to Paris so we weren't intending to stay in our hotel room all day and all night so it was more than adequate to come home to after a very full day of exploring the sights and sounds of beautiful Paris. Even though it is located on a very busy street, the hotel itself is just slightly up from the main thoroughfare on a very quiet alley and therefore we did not experience much noise late at night at all and were able to get very good nights sleep on all our nights there. As other reviewers have stated - this is NOT a luxuriously appointed 5 star hotel. It does however fulfill its promises of being clean, tidy and relatively spacious for european standards. We didn't take up the offer of breakfasts at the hotel instead opting to walk down the street and try the many bakeries (we weren't disappointed with the quality of the gorgeous croissants on offer!). We always felt safe returning to the hotel late at night which was an added bonus. Would thoroughly recommend this hotel for anyone wishing to stay in a reasonably priced hotel that is close to everything. The staff were wonderful and very kind (especially having to listen to me trying to talk my very limited French to them) and as others have said, if you try and speak French to the French they are always much more willing to help you. Will definitely be back one day.

A word of advice that one cannot repeat enough: Don't automatically expect everyone to be fluent in English. If you try to speak a little bit of French you will get a very good response and better attitude from service staff, at this hotel and elsewhere. I am a French Canadian, so this is no problem for me, but my partner, who is an American, did make an effort and was amply rewarded.

Ok, so not too much light...I wasn't upset about that. The bed was comfortable...But as I lay there, I started to realize ther's a very strange, sweet, garbage-like odor in the room. I started to look around...the carpet was very dirty, with stains..or mold? I don't know where the smell was coming from. It was so disgusting that I had to sleep with the window open at a time when there were around 5-6 degrees celsius (40-45 F) outside. I had all my t-shirts and sweaters on me, just to make it through the night. I can't call that a night's sleep b/c I woke up all the time, sickened with the smell and the cold.
