{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Enjoyed our stay I stayed at Wida with my mum and 3 kids. The staff were very friendly and obliging. The airconditioned rooms were comfortable and modern. I have stayed at many hotels in Bali and have seen the best and the worst. This one is pleasantly average, well located and quiet (only 24 rooms). We got used to the fact that they were scrimping on the bacon with our breakfasts.... not that we ever left hungry, and the bathrooms could have done with a scourer (as per most bathrooms in bali) But overall, we enjoyed staying at the Wida and would certainly go back again.", "Date": "Aug 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR593274029", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Balibagus"}, {"Content": "wida hotel o.k i stayed here with my daughter and two friends,the rooms were small but neat and clean.it is a small hotel with a court yard pool that looks out to the street.i was a little disappointed at first but because it was right on the shopping strip the girls loved it . breakfasts was the same every day , pretty boring.juice,eggs,toast,coffee.if you want a resort style accomadation then dont stay here.if you want a neat room then its fine", "Date": "Jul 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR534367184", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "getawayAustralia"}, {"Content": "In love with the wida       the pool", "Date": "Apr 25, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR615601109", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "tyte"}, {"Content": "wida is special The Wida is small enough to be private but staff are friendly and the rooms are new, clean and large.
