{"Reviews": [{"Content": "A trip back in time We had stayed in this hotel about 5 years prior to our trip and were very pleased to stay here again. This time we booked the tower room. Basically an elevator takes you to the 5th floor and it is then quite a hike to the very top of the tower (60 steps). Because the stairs are so narrow and twisting, not much furniture of comfort could be taken up, but to stay in a tower dating back to the 13th or 14th century was an experience we will not forget. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. The staff would often stop and chat with us and on the morning that we left (at 5am to catch a flight), they insisted that they make us a cappucino before we left (probably the best one of our trip too). The breakfast was limited but satisfactory.The location is great and if we go back to Florence again we will always have this hotel as our hotel of choice. While other hotels might be more to the North American standards and comfort level, this hotel just provides such a wonderful piece of history to experience.", "Date": "Dec 8, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR578466957", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Euroguy66"}, {"Content": "One of a kind The reviews on this hotel vary wildly. It is the oldest hotel in Florence and the 2nd oldest hotel in Italy, and that should tell you something. This place has a lot of old world character. That sounds great but most of us are used to modern properties. We are a family of 4 with two teen boys (16  18). I booked this hotel based on the recommendation of a friend who loves this hotel and always stays in the ancient tower. This tower is part of the hotel and is 700 years old. It is also know as the Torre Monalda. The cool thing about staying here, apart from the fact that is is one of the city's original watch towers is that it consists of a small bathroom, small bedroom with two twins, larger bedroom with sink in room, and the grand prize is the top floor living area. This top floor, like the rest of the rooms, is sparsely furnished but has a fantastic view. There are approx 12 windows over looking the city, remember it was a watch tower. The tower is higher that all the other building except for the duomo and one other palace. The tower has air conditioning but you can also open the windows and catch some wonderful breezes. You can not book this room online...you need to call the hotel directly.We enjoyed staying here, but my husband did compare it to camping out. All of the furnishings seemed to be about 30 years old or older. Lamps you haven't seen since visiting grandma as a child. This is a tower ,so the stair case winds around and around as you climb by the opening to the rooms. So if you don't do stairs, these rooms are not for you. The top room does have a small TV and fridge. I read some reviews that compared it to a haunted castle but we did not find it scary at all.The location could not be better. It is on the same block at Hotel Davanzati, trip advisors #1 hotel. Breakfast is fine, very traditional European breakfast with rolls, yogert, cereal, fruit, coffee, tea, hot chocolate, packaged cheese spread etc. It is served in a very nice breakfast room. The lobby and check in desk were very unique and beautiful in their own way. See pictures on the hotel web site. The hotel workers were very nice to us and even joked with our sons. The man who took our bags up to the room told us he was made in Egypt. Most of the other workers seemed to be Italian. They do not speak much English and are not conversational. We had the hotel make reservations for us to the Accademia and Uffizzi. Definately the way to go! It eliminated waiting in line and the tour guides were wonderful. We walked to the hotel from the train station, actually we walked everywhere. The Porta Rossa is very reasonably priced and has a wonderful location in the heart of Florence. This hotel is different and not for everyone, but where else can you stay in an ancient tower with enough space for a family.", "Date": "Sep 22, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR411490321", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Judy88"}, {"Content": "In touch with history Stayed here one night due to our flight being cancelled. It was probably the last available room in Florence that night and they didn't rip us off at all on the price, for which we are grateful - most other room providers took full advantage of the situation to rip off our fellow travellers in the same situation that night. Found it to be an amazing hotel in terms of character, and agree with nearly all the more complimentary comments on the accommodation, breakfast service and excellent location of the hotel that have been made recently. Our room was huge, a bit basic yes but interesting old / antique furniture, everything worked, it would cost a fortune to bring this place up to a more modern standard and by doing so its appeal would be lost. We think the hotel management have the right approach, its not for some but thank goodness for an individual approach. Its a matter of what you want, I would happily stay a week here, I think my wife would want something a little smarter, - but then we are nearly at retirement age, not young things any more! We were in room 88, top floor. Housekeeping standard in our room very satisfactory, bed linen spotless, ditto bathroom, and we had plenty of towels. Breakfast not fantastic considering the price of the accommodation but very acceptable, fresh tasting bread, fruit, etc (coffee from help yourself urn revolting but much better from the counter we were advised by others - unfortunately the member of staff serving it disappeared!). Two things only on the negative side -an unpleasant smell, quite strong, persisted in the corridor outside our room, (not, I stress, at all in evidence inside the room), this was particularly off putting as we were being shown up! - and all the comments made already about the lack of civility and to some extent the personal grooming of the reception team are only slightly (in our limited experience of the place) exaggerated. They were quick and efficient, but no hint of a welcoming smile and a lesson or two in personal grooming was needed here and there.

Our room was very large, high ceiling, twin beds very clean no nonsense ward robe and drawer space and bathroom practical but certainly not Relais  Chateaux - simple would be the correct adjective. No extras apart from a small bar of soap and those awful flimsy towels that I always put on a par with a dishcloth. Take your own towel or by one at Rinacente. The rooms on the back were quite noisy as there is a small road that the ubiquitous moped use as a cut through and the dustbins were collected quite early or late whatever time you retire.

One day, the maid removed the extra toilet paper from the rooms, and we had to take rolls out of the hotel's public bathroom so we had some. On another day, the maid smoked in my room. The rooms come with air conditioning units, but no controls are provided. If you want air, the staff come around with one master control to turn on your unit, but they don't leave you with the control. How dumb is that??? We froze at night and had no way to turn the temperature down for ourselves. We would have had to call the desk to come up and adjust it for us, and who wants to do that in the middle of the night? The breakfast was not good. We had rotten plums and bad coffee. I had to check out at 5:30am to catch my flight, but nobody was at the front desk to help me at that hour. Luckily, I saw a doorbell next to the front door, so I went outside and rang it, which awoke the man from his sleep on the sofa in the lobby. He stumbled over to the desk to check me out and call a taxi for me. I can't believe this place is rated as a 3-star hotel. It is more akin to a 1-star hotel in the States. It was definitely not worth the price we paid, and I would not recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "Oct 17, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR281200687", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Not your average hotel The room was huge and had a lot of character.

The hotel itself is old and charming--a couple of mosquitos but no big deal in the summer. The air conditioning worked great in our room, and it was clean. Breakfast was included but it was so-so--better off getting something elsewhere.
