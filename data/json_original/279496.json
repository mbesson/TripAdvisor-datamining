There is a Monoprix (like Marks and Spencers) a couple of streets away for food. It is not a conventional hotel insofar as there is no reception desk or restaurant, it is more of a collection of self contained apartments in a beauitiful little building. We had a room at the back of the building and did not hear a single noise from outside - and we were there over Christmas and New Year! You do have to call to let them know when you are arriving but we did this when we arrived in Paris and were about 15 minutes away and it was no problem. You have a key for your room and an electronic fob for the front door so you can come and go as you please.

MINUSES: Check your confirmation email, people!! It says: \"This hotel does NOT have a reception desk. Contact the hotel to arrange arrival\". So that's a minus--you have to check in when they tell you and it is not a moment before 10 am and probably not after 4:30 pm. There is NO ONE on the premises. I have no idea where the buzzer goes to or where the person who lets you in stays normally. The lift is like a half of a coffin--can hardly accommodate you and your rollie bag. There is no glass in the bathroom or anywhere else, even though I had a microwave and a mini-fridge. I called to ask , \"are there any plates or silver I could use?\" \"No! You did not book a kitchen!\" \"Why is there a fridge and microwave here?\" \" You have them, but you did not book them\" \"Could I have a glass to rinse my mouth out after brushing my teeth?\" \"SIGH...!\" Later a woman did bring me two coffee cups. \"Could I have an extra blanket? It's very cold\" (-2C outside). \"No extra blankets. You have a heater\". No internet. PLUSES: It's incredibly cheap for Paris. The bed was heavenly- solid foam. The pillows and linens were wonderful. The room (21) was completely quiet and i slept soundly--it was really too cold for people to be on the streets at night. The bathroom was new and pristine. The towels were great. The water was scalding. There was a tub and shower. It is in a lovely area. The key pad works better than most places that have codes. I didn't see anyone else.

Nice parisian windows giving you a glimpse of a typical/but busy paris street.

The cafes are busy even on weekdays and rarely close before 3 am, so even with wax earplugs we couldn't sleep at all until they closed. Unfortunately, construction in the street using a jackhammer started about three hours later. The hotel staff was friendly, but unable to relocate us to a different room since they were fully booked. They asked us to send any complaints we might have to Expedia. One of the chairs in the room was trashed, but the hotel staff was unable to provide a replacement. The bed was made by the room service, but they did not vacuum the room or empty the trash while we're away. The mouse which lived underneath the fridge appreciated that and came out of its hiding place at night. A written request for a mouse trap was ignored by the hotel staff.

The only thing wrong with this place is the noise level at night. Otherwise, it's really a fantastic deal. The property consists of about 10 rooms that are all situated off a narrow spiral staircase. A tiny 2-person elevator is available for those who don't like the spiral staircase. The rooms either face the street directly, or are off to the side a bit. It's well-situated, sitting just behind Saint Sulpice Church. There's a bakery down the street, small restaurants and cafes across the street, great designer shopping in the area, and 2 metro stops just 3 minutes away. It takes about 7 minutes to walk to the Seine. We stayed in a mini-apartment on the fourth floor that consisted of a small ante-room, a small bathroom, and a bedroom that had a mini-kitchen with sink, fridge, small cooktop, and table and chairs. The apartment came with dishes and silverware, an ironing board, daily housekeeping, flat panel TV, a phone, and some information on the area. Hot water was plentiful, water pressure was great, we were able to control the room temperature via the electrical heaters, and the place was very clean. The bathroom was very well lit and had modern fixtures. All in all, it was more than adequate, especially for 45 Euros per night (we got a killer deal through Travelocity). The only problem -- and a big problem at that -- was the noise level at night. Our apartment faced the street and the single-pane windows weren't thick enough to block the noise coming from below. The bars across the street cater to a younger crowd that likes to party and we heard a lot of drunken yelling until 4:00 a.m. every morning. That, coupled with the echoing cavernlike effect of every sound bouncing off the buildings made everything much louder than you'd expect. Even the sound of women walking in high-heeled boots was amplified. The sound of someone sneezing on the street was louder than a flush from the toilet upstairs.
