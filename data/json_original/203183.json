The hotel is located in a residential area of Rome off of Via Salaria, and it's virtually impossible to find. We spent over 45 minutes circling the streets in the area, before finally stumbling upon it. After checking in, we were given a room on the second floor that overlooked a preschool. The room was okay, although it was very dark due to the heavy tapestry fabric that covered every wall. PROS: -Hotel does provide free ice, travel items (toothbrush, razors, etc) to guests -Nice down pillows, although be sure to ask for another one...they're not very plump. -Mini-fridge in room that you can store some items in. CONS: -Ridiculously hard to locate. -Parking is 15-25 euros per night, depending upon the season. -NO restaurants or shops within walking distance...eat before you arrive. (Do NOT eat at the bar in the hotel...my 10 euro pizza was a frozen pizza that had been microwaved.) -Unable to control room temperature...our room had to be approximately 75 degrees inside. -I didn't feel safe walking the streets...though it's a nicer area, I felt like I was more likely to be mugged on this side of town than I did in central Rome! -Front desk staff was rude and seemed unwilling to provide much information. I was completely unimpressed with this hotel. When we checked in, the clerk requested to keep our passports for 10-15 minutes. After 30 minutes had elapsed, we returned to the desk to pick up our passports and the clerk reluctantly handed them over. We asked for directions to a local restaurant and were told that there was a lovely one on the next street over. We walked over 4 miles trying to locate a restaurant in the neighborhood, and only came across 2 snack bars that served microwaved meals. So, I ordered a pizza from the bar at a cost of 10 euro. What I got was a frozen pizza that had been microwaved or just barely heated in an oven. I complained to the desk clerk and was told that I could get 10 euros worth of items from the minibar or a new pizza. When I stated that I didn't want either and requested 10 euros off of my parking fee instead, we went back and forth on it for several minutes. (Please understand, I checked into this hotel at 1600 and checked out at 0230 in order to catch an early morning flight at Fiumicino...I was hardly at the hotel!) Also, for the slighly accident prone like myself...the bathroom is a small step up from the main bedroom area. In the middle of the night, it's easy to stumble on this step. Be careful! I'm amazed the hotel was designed in this way. Bottom line: I would never stay here again, and will be notifying my travel agency about the poor experience I had at this hotel.

We managed to find the Rivoli as part of a flight/hotel package. The hotel is small but very well kept. Our room was cleaned every day of our stay. I emailed them ahead of time and told them it was our honeymoon and they left a bottle of champagne in our room and upgraded us to a king sized bed for a very nominal amount. The bathroom was beautiful, completely made from granite or other stone material with full bathtub & shower, toilet and large sink. Lots of wonderful toiletries! We had a tiny balcony on which was a small table and two chairs, with a very distant view of St. Peter's. There is a tiny food store just a couple of streets west of the hotel if you walk down Bruni Buozzi. They don't speak a lot of English but they've got fantastic prosciutto, wine, olive oil, cheese and breads. Perfect for an intimate dinner on our little balcony. The hotel's location is a bit low key, in a nice little neighbourhood at the northern end of the large park where Villa Borghese and the zoo are. Via Taramelli is a tiny almost alley like road so don't be surprised if your taxi can't make it up to the front door of the hotel. It's literally a 30 second walk from the main street. There is an amazing restaurant just a 5 minute walk east of Via Taramelli on Bruno Buozzi called Pagaroma. They provide food AND champagne even before you order and it's all included with your meal. We ate there at least 2x if not 3 and everything we tried on the menu was absolutely delish! Continental breakfast was included with our room each morning. Best part was the little flaky pastries in the warmer each morning. Get there early. The rest of the breakfast was your typical continental offering at most european hotels. The closest major piazza is Piazza del Popolo, so you are going to do a bit of walking to get to any of the major sites. We walked to the Trevi Fountain in the evening, walked everywhere else too even though at the end of a long day it seemed like a long walk back to the hotel (uphill).

There is a city bus stop nearby, but for first-time visitors (we're Americans) it can be tricky to get up to speed in negotiating the local bus lines. There are a few fairly expensive, and good, restaurants near the hotel, but no neighborhood feel whatsoever; it's dead in the evenings. On the back side of the hotel, on the street parallel to Via Taramelli, is a little \"tavola calda\" with a very friendly owner, and one more street down from there is a snack bar--both good for quick and inexpensive meals.

One staffer in particular (name starts with a P and ends with an O) said \"I don't know\" enough times to become a running joke for me and my husband the rest of the vacation. He spoke English but couldn't help with anything, reservations, recommendations, directions. In fact, when I asked where we could purchase a camera he literally said \"Walk down the busy street, you'll find a store.\" HA. Breakfast was adequate but served by a sour-pussed waiter. I told my husband that IF I EVER went back to Rome, I would stay near Termini which is terrifying at night but Termini is the station that connects you to every area you want to be in while in Rome. It's too bad this hotel couldn't be better located and better staffed.", "Date": "April 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Loveland, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cHad a wonderful stay....super nice staff and very clean hotel!\u201d", "Author": "1bsymom", "ReviewID": "UR103596721", "Content": "My husband and I just returned from a 10 day stay at Hotel Rivoli.

The hotel staff was awesome, especially Monia at the front desk and Jenny in the breakfast room. The room we stayed is was very clean. The shower was great. It had a lot of water pressure. Like most hotels in Europe there were no wash clothes but they were available from the front desk. The rooms have a nice little balcony with a table and chairs. We sat out there every night with a bottle of wine. The breakfast is included and had your standard European breakfast of meats, cheeses, breads and pastries. It also had juices, milk, eggs, cereal, different types of yogurt, fresh fruit and coffee. The hotel has a few restaurants in walking distance and a great little grocery store behind it. It is on a a bus route and we had no problem catching the bus to go anywhere in the city. This hotel was currenty remodeling the outside patios....it looked like it was going to be really nice.

I had checked out many hotels online and found that this hotel, in particular, had the most value for the money. There were things that were not to our liking such as the hot water problem. We tried in the early mornng, afternoon and evenings to take a hot shower. The three of us, in total, accomplished this once. We contacted the front desk and they told us what to do. It really did not work so we just made the most of it and figured that it was for a short time and we would survive. The hotel staff, including the front desk and especially one of the maids were super. The maid is from the Philippines and so helpful and friendly. We just loved seeing her in the morning for breakfast, which, by the way, was great. She always had a smile and ready to help. Just perfect. She is truly an asset to this hotel. The breakfast included eggs, bacon (Italian), ham, coldcuts, cheeses, cereal, rolls, juice, fresh fruit and pineapple (not fresh, but delicious) and ALL kinds of coffee. Any type you desired. It was all delicious/ As for the location, it is a bit off the beaten track but in a beautiful location. We were able to get around, without transportation, and found some nice shopping areas and restaurants. The front desk had given us the names of three restaurants in particular and we were pleased with just one of them. In fact, we had dinner and lunch there twice. This restaurant is about 15 minute walking distance from the hotel but worth the trip. The name of it is Taverna Rossini. The house wine (red) is to die for and the service and food are the same. We did go to a very exclusive restaurant nearby before going to the Taverna Rossini. The name of this restaurant is Pagaroma. It was expensive, they had no house wine, only very expensive wine, AND if you were not a local and rich, forgetaboutit!!! The service stunk and you were completely ignored. The food and service were not worth the mega amounts of Euro that this place costs. Another restaurant that we went to on our first night at the hotel was Ambasciata D'Abbruzzo. No house wine and since we did not want to spend the money for regular wine, we were immediately treated like aliens from another planet. The hotel, itself, is lovely and just as the pictures on this sight show. We were three adults in a room and very comfortable. Our son had a regular and very comfortable bed. We slept in a king bed. The room was clean and was lovely. Our requests for extra pillows, towels, etc. were met with a smile and immediately sent to our room. No problems at all. The staff were all very helpful and pleasant and always with smiles. They all spoke perfect English. The free internet was a plus. We decided to use taxis to travel to the many landmarks. We would have a taxi pick us up at the hotel and take us to a landmark. From there, we would walk to two or three other places, per day. We utilized a map of landmarks and make plans to visit certain places nearby each other each day. We then took a cab back to the hotel after the day was complete. It worked out perfectly. Probably a bit more expensive than taking the subway or hop on hop off bus but much more comfortable for us. The hotel is great is you want to get away from the madness of Rome at night. It is quiet and peaceful there at the Rivoli. Plus, we found that the price was great for the value. We loved it. So, if you want my recommendation, do not listen to all of the small talk about the problems at this hotel. It was worth the Euro and we were pleasantly surprised by the beauty of the hotel. We had a great time in Rome and would definitely use this hotel again.", "Date": "October 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aberdeen, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNice, but?\u201d", "Author": "TonyL47", "ReviewID": "UR80973080", "Content": "Nice room, well appointed, & the staff were very friendly, & helpful.

When I later browsed the Trip Advisor reviews I have to say I was worried as some people were quite negative regarding their stay at the hotel. So it was with a slightly uneasy feeling that we left for Rome at the end of July. When we arrived we were warmly welcomed by receptionist,Erica, who dealt with our accommodation very quickly and we were shown to our room. It was a ground floor room with a small patio area. The room looked recently refurbished and the walls were covered in a dark fabric, which wasn't an issue but the pattern on it constantly moved infront of my eyes and instantly made me feel dizzy. I approached reception about the situation and within 20 minutes we had been moved to a room with less busy walls. The bathroom was in black granite and sparkling white ceramicware and there was plenty of hot water at any time of the day. Both towels and sheets were changed daily and the room was spotlessly clean. There was also a\"free\" safe in the room, we've stayed in some hotels where there is a charge for this facility. The bed was comfortable and so were the pillows and the air conditioning worked well. We had a balcony with a table and chairs. The public areas in the hotel were very clean and the decoration was typically Italian, lots of marble and travertine. Breakfast was quite ample with bacon and scrambled eggs for those who wanted something hot. The continental breakfast included rolls and croissants, German rye bread and sliced bread for toasting, butter, jams and spreads, a selection of sliced cheese, ham and salami, cereals, yoghurt, cakes, fresh fruit and plum tomatoes, a selection of juices, tea and coffee. If you wanted something that wasn't on the table the staff were very obliging. The hotel doesn't have a restaurant as such but it does have a basic menu which can be ordered at the bar, handy if you've had a hard day's sightseeing and your feet are refusing to take you to one of the local restaurants. If you like pizza then walk down the hill and over the river to the RossoPomodoro which serves fab food at reasonable prices. For a more formal meal you could visit the Pargaroma restaurant which is up the hill from the Rivoli, two courses with drinks around 67 euros, excellent food and service. Back to the hotel - all staff were very helpful, especially when we were asking for directions and info. regarding public transport. They gave us names and directions to the local restaurants. To get into Rome centre the best way to travel is by the No. 52 bus, which arrives about every 20 mins. You will need to buy your tickets from the tobacconist shop near the Pargaroma, they cost 1 euro each and last for 75 mins. Remember to validate your ticket in the yellow machine when you get on the bus, if you don't you can have a fine. Overall we had a very comfortable stay at the Rivoli and feel we had very good value for money.

It was our first vist to Rome and we booked BW Rivoli in advance- at a good rate, yet we were a bit anxious to see if the good reviews were to be confirmed. They all confirmed- and we had a very pleasant stay. One of the big advantages of the hotel is the quiet location, which is a big plus after spending a day in the very busy touristic areas of the city. At the same time, the acces to the city centre is very easy- just take bus 52 which stops just a few steps from the hotel and go to the end of the line, a 15 minutes trip. The hotel itself is small, cozy, nicely decorated and welcoming, with helpful reception staff and a romantic style. We had rooms 207 and 212- not too big, yet big enough and comfortable. The bathrooms were big, with shower and bath tub. The coffee & tea making facilities (kettle+ instant coffee & tea) were brought into the room on request, for free. A tough picker would say that there was one downside - the minibar in our room didn't work, but for us this wasn't really an issue, so we didn't even report it. The room was clean, bedsheets and towels were changed daily and looked immaculate. We found also useful that close to the hotel (just go down the main street, than turn second left) there was a supermarket (GDS- the Italian correspondent of Carrefour)- were you could find nice fruit, juice, mineral water, sweets etc- almost everything you could wish to \"supplement\" your staying. Breakfast is ok, but pretty much the same thing every day; still enough to choose from (usually 2 types of ham/ salami, cheese, sausages, eggs, various yogourts, jam, butter, fresh fruits, croissants, cakes, milk, cereals), coffe/cappuccino. Re internet access- we had our laptop with us and connected easily to the Wireless internet network using the password given by the reception staff. All in all, we had a very pleasant stay at Best Western Rivoli Hotel, would stay there again any time and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good value for money stay in Rome!

The Hotel is down a pokey side street and has little to offer in the way of facilities. Luckily we found so much to do in Rome that we were hardly at the hotel. We ended up in a double (twin beds, we pushed them together but the cleaner kept seperating them...we took the hint) smoking room which smelt foul, the stale smell was impregnated in the fabric walls. The bath plughole leaked and there was little hot water. The bathroom was well overdue attention.When we went down for breakfast on our first morning we noticed that every single table was full of dirty dishes. I heard other English guests complaining that it was disgusting. There wasnt anything left to eat (if you do go, have breakfast early) the yoghurts (pretty much the only food left) were 2 months out of date!! I pointed this out and got no response from the waiter!!! not even an acknowledgement. The staff were so rude, we asked if we could change rooms due to the smell and were told NO. Eventually we gave up and vowed never to return. Having stayed in a number of 4 star hotels I would struggle to rate it with 3!!! Its not that close to the centre, and to be honest I cant think of anything nice to say about it. If you havent already booked...DONT!!! Rome is such a fantastic place although we did notice that we were always charged TAT (tourist added tax), make a note of how much things are before you ask/order them. I would never recomend this hotel to anyone!!!!", "Date": "December 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Thessaloniki, Greece", "Title": "\u201cterrible bathrooms, unfriendly staff\u201d", "Author": "petra82", "ReviewID": "UR5030480", "Content": "We are a family and stayed there in two rooms, 801 and 802, for 5 nights.

Perhaps that was a good thing, as it turned out to be a pleasant stay. Tea, Coffee making facilities are available for free upon request, ask at reception before heading for your room. Room was cleaned each day, fresh towels etc. Breakfast was basic with some weird cracker bread, croissants, cornflakes, tea coffee etc. All room amenities were in working order ie shower bath etc. Most staff were helpful speaking to me in English as I didn't know one word of Italian. I would recommend this Hotel to anyone. The only negative...... the walls are far from sound proofed, so if you are going there for a Romantic weekend well lets just say, be careful otherwise the rest of the Hotel will hear you. Even worse you may end up having to listen to others if you catch my drift. There is a Metro 10 mins walk from Hotel \"Euclide\" by turning right out of the Hotel, right and then right again walk down to the end of this road cross over the road and left (for about 20 feet) then take right about 50 feet takes you to Euclide station. You can buy an all day Ticket for 4 Euros, which allows you on Metro, Bus and Tram as often as you like. The Vatican, Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, Colosseum etc are all only Metro stops away from each other. Rome is a great place to visit. REMEMBER LIKE ALL MAJOR CITIES HAVE A DEATH GRIP ON YOUR PURSE WALLET CAMERA ETC, especially when travelling on the Metro, the busier the train is (people squashed against each other) the greater the risk of being pick-pocketed. THEY WORK IN GROUPS!!!!. I almost lost my camera to some female who managed to get the zip opened on the camera case and get her hand on the camera. Luckily the train jerked and moved her away from me and I could then see what was going on.
