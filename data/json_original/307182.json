This place is very rustic  isolated first off... for the price it is wildly poor value!! honest! I stayed at Komaneka Resort in Ubud for the same price in total luxury! If you enjoy sleeping with bugs,  flying moths in the bathroom, without music or tv... if you like yoga as well, then this might be the right place! The air con is a ceiling fan, my clothes were constantly damp, the gym was pathetic with century old machines, dirty, no towels, water. the spa is ancient in a kind of charming way... but very expensive treatments!! another couple also agreed it was a 'rip off'. I took a cookery course that was only preparing 3 dishes for a large price. I am telling you that it was VERY disappointing! there is NO clue in any of the info! but beware! the organic garden was good,  I did like the food, but the fact that I had to pay for my 3 nights IN advance was a telling sign of what was to follow!!!BEWARE!", "Date": "Feb 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR640136727", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "nancette"}, {"Content": "Best stay in Bali       Waking up with softest shade of green.", "Date": "Jan 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR479820994", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Chiki-ko"}, {"Content": "Paradise in Bali       The deluxe hut", "Date": "Dec 1, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR723063235", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Doc_Jon"}, {"Content": "The real thing       Villa", "Date": "Mar 28, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR418006432", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "mosquita"}, {"Content": "Just awesome!
