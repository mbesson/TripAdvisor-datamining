Our bathroom had a bath with a shower (only partly accessible) and a shower. However, the shower we used didn't have a soap or shampoo holder. We had no choice but to leave our soap on the wet shower floor for the next person. The other problem with the bathroom (and this is shared by many hotels I've been in) is the lack of shelf space for our toiletries. There are three of us in a room but the only space for toothbrushes, toothpaste, floss, shavers, shaving cream, etc., etc.. is around the sink. Not nearly adequate! And everything get wet... For breakfast we had to go outside and down those uneven steps to the sidewalk and then walk up some steps to the Bistro de Paris. We had a choice of tea or coffee with either a croissant, muffin or bagel. Plus a small dish of fruit salad. The croissant and muffins are baked fresh and are very nice.

The staff weren't overly friendly but they were helpful and accommodating. When we arrived they were just finishing up cleaning our rooms. They provided plenty of towels and everything was clean. Upon first impression, the room was fine. We got what we paid for, two beds to sleep in and a bathroom (which was very clean and looked as thought it had been recently renovated). One of my friends recently had to move out of her apartment after battling a problem with bedbugs, so when we read one of the reviews on this site which mentioned the possibility of bedbugs, we were determined to seek them out. We stripped the beds and examined the mattresses' seems for evidence and couldn't find a trace of them. Trust me, my friend knew exactly what to look for and was satisfied the whole room was free of them. The hotel was in the perfect location. We could easily walk to both Old Montreal and Downtown.

The bistro looked cosy, but the personnel there was certainly not accommodating. I went for my breakfast early (around 7:30 - being jetlagged) and by 11:30 was hungry again (studying gives me the munchies) When I went down to order a sandwich, I was told this was not possible, since they were closing after serving breakfast and that \"they didn't have time to do that now\". It seems that they operate seperately from the hotel, which wouldn't be a problem, unless one encountered an attitude like this.

Dirty looks and rude greetings. If you are on the second or higher floor, you will experience the secondary stairway, which leads to the communal basement. The kitchen is clean if you want to use it in front of everyone. Although down the stairs you will see rolling baskets and wheel chairs and garbage bags on the steps. When you get to the main floor, you attempt to open the door to the outside, only to notice that it has been screwed to its frame. The whole hotel makes for an unpleasant visit.

Hotel is divided between two buildings on either side of Sherbrooke Street. This is quite inconvenient as I will explain. Please read my review of this horrible place. The towels were frayed, thin, small. The bed sheets were thread-bare and see-through. No extra blankets. No shampoo or conditioner, lotion as is customary at most hotels. No clock, tv was very small, shower curtain was too small for the shower opening, water all over because of this. Shower curtain rod was a tension rod that slipped down the shower walls and fell down with every shower taken. Bed was old, creeky, extremely poor quality mattress. Lamp and room lighting was poor. Large wooden window shutters instead of curtains or blinds were difficult and cumbersome and allowed in full view from the street or zero. Room did not have a coffee machine and breakfast voucher from cafe was a rip. If you want to take your bagel and coffee from the cafe to go you are forced to pay extra to do so for each breakfast. When questioned why, they were hard pressed to provide an answer. The room was not supplied with kleenex tissues and had only one roll of toilet paper. I had to cross the street and ask for another. The closet and room in general was small. Bathroom was miniscule. It looks like they tried to spend money on the finishes. The washroom had nice tiles and the shower looked nice. However, the taps made this extremely high pitched, loud sound when the shower was running. It sounded like a fire alarm going off and nothing we adjusted could make the sound dissipate. They should have spent the money on details like this instead of pretty tiles. I woke up to the smell of cigarette smoke on Saturday morning. When I spoke to the front desk about it they said that no one was smoking in the rooms. I'm not sure how they could know that for sure from across the street. No one offered to look into it or follow up with me. Customer service lacking. I can't think of one thing that was positive about this experience.

Hotel De Paris is the worst hotel I ever stayed at!!! The hotel is really dirty and smells. The room was tiny. The carpet was dirty and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look like it was vacuumed for a very long time. The sheets and comforter were disgusting and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look like they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been washed. The walls were extremely thin (you can hear everything). The bathroom had stains and was gross. The hotel should be rated 1 star or a low scale hostel. I tried to upgrade/switch room, but the other rooms were worse. FYI, I checked out their web site and the rooms are nowhere close to the pictures. Also, I woke up after the third night (this morning) with bed bug bites on my arms and legs. I have already written an email to hotwire telling them that I will never use their service again. Please do yourself a favor and never stay at this hotel!

My sister made a separate reservation for a 3-star superior room, for herself and her fiance for the same days. We both received e-mail confirmations. The day before we were expected to arrive, I received a phone call from the desk confirming a room upgrade to a 3-star superior room, I had made several weeks earlier. The man asked what time to expect my arrival and I stated that I will be arriving in the evening. He confimed everything and I assumed everything would go according to plan. When we arrived at the hotel, we stated at the desk that we had reservations, to which the young man at the desk asked \"If we had brought our own sheets?\". Bewildered, we said \"No\" to which the man responded that it would be \"$3 per night for sheets.\" My sister then asked, \"Is this a hotel?\" The man stammered and said \"Yes\" and then proceeded to shuffle through a batch of receipts from individuals that had checked in. Then he said that he couldn't find our reservations based on these receipts. Neither of us could figure out why he didn't simply check the computer in front of him for our reservations. And how is it that I received a phone call from the hotel confirming my reservation the day before? The man said that the individual in question didn't know what he was talking about. We insisted that since he lost both our reservations (An unlikely coincidence) that he do us the courtesy of find us rooms. He insisted there was no space at the hotel. Strange, considering that 10 min. prior he was willing to offer us a room, albeit with their 'hostel' annex. He sent us to a shabby motel, saying that they had two rooms available. They did not. We went back, fuming. Finally, they made arrangements at a Best Western, more expensive, using my contact information, mysteriously made available from the computer. How is it that our reservations were lost when he was able to pull my name from the hotel computer? We spoke with the Hotel de Paris manager, Hector Zana, on the phone, who said that the hotel would pick up the difference in the room rates when we checked out the following day. However, when we called the manager, he was extremely rude and denied ever having the conversation or offering to pick up the difference in our tabs. We promptly called the police, which got the same rude response from the manager. What's worse, the manager said that we made the reservation through a non-affiliated website- a blatant lie as the hotel had sent us e-mail confirmations when we made the reservations. So here we were stuck paying $50 more after spending hours arguing with these people. Plus, we had to call our credit cards making sure that we were charged for the missed reservations as our accounts on the hotel's website were still 'active'. Our theory, that there are no such 3-star rooms and when the hotel realized that's what we were expecting, conveniently 'lost' 2 seperate reservations and bamboozled us by promising to cover the extra expense of costlier rooms elsewhere. Despite their nice website, this is not a true hotel but a hostel run by a bunch of con artists.", "Date": "July 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cStay Away from Hotel de Paris\u201d", "Author": "Bastet412", "ReviewID": "UR5429590", "Content": "After making a reservation with the Hotel de Paris more then a month and a half ago and receiving a confirmation from their website, I assumed that my vacation in Montreal would go with out a hitch. Upon checking in, I tell the person at the desk that I have a reservation for the superior Queen Room in Annex 1. He then asks me if I want sheets...silly question of course! I then ask if the hotel de Paris was a hotel, to which he replies yes, but they also have a hostel. (What kind of hotel is \u00e2\u20ac\u01533 Star\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and has a hostel?) Anyway, the \"concierge\" proceeds to search for my reservation everywhere but the computer and informs me that he couldn't find my reservation and that the hotel was completely booked. Even with the confirmation information he was unwilling to be accommodating. There is a computer in the lobby and I checked my reservation and it was still active. How is it that they were unable to locate it? After almost 3 hours of trying to find us a room, the person at the desk finally called the Sam W, who I assume is the owner of the hotel. Sam W, instructed the person at the desk to find us a room in another hotel. The first \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hotel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was Hotel de la Cassa. If this location is comparable to the Hotel de Paris then they really should remodel. First we had to be buzzed in to the Hotel de la Cassa and the women was behind what looked like a prison window and did not speak either French or English well and frankly the lobby smelled like cat pee. We needed two rooms and there was only one, so we had to return to the Hotel de Paris. Upon seeing us again, the person at the desk called back Sam W. After several minutes of them conversing Sam W promised that they would find us a room in another hotel and that the Hotel de Paris would pick up the difference. All we would have to do is call the manager Monday morning Hector Z. This was an obvious lie, because upon checking out of the hotel that they found for us on Monday, we called the manager Hector Z and he proceeded to say that Sam W had never spoken to him and that it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t his problem and that the reservation that I had made was through an independent web-site; not true at all since I went to the Hotel de Paris website and made the reservation through them and received a confirmation through the Hotel.

Although the bathroom was remodeled, it did not make up for the dirty green carpet, non working tv, tiny room for 6, and dirty radiator with garbage inside the floor area arouond the radiator. One of the beds, which were hard as rocks had a pull out bed. When I pulled it out, the sheets were filthy and the actual pullout drawer was disgusting, full of dirt and hair. When I informed the guy at the front desk, he said he would get us new sheets. My husband insisted on speaking with the owner, but the front desk guy said he had no idea where he was or when he would be there. We had to pay for one night, but never ended up staying there. That would have ruined our trip to Montreal. We got a room at the Springhill Suites in Old Town instead for $15 more a night. Also, the parking for $8 they offer is street parking and you cannot park on the street from 3 to 5 pm. We also found out the place mostly rents out beds to people who cannot afford rooms.

We really enjoy the place, but I think it is probably not for everyone. First, it would not be for anyone with bad knees. Just getting into the lobby is quite a steep climb from the street. Second, it would not be for light sleepers - at least not on summer weekends. Montreal is a late-night town, and the rooms at the front, especially, get a lot of street noise. That said, we like to stay in the front, in one of two rooms with a rooftop balcony - a fantastic place to chill with a beverage and some conversation. In fact, the balcony is the whole point for us - the view of Rue Sherbrooke and downtown is wonderful. We've stayed in both rooms that share the balcony, and they were both nice. We were much less impressed with the standard, balcony-less room where we stayed on our first visit. Of course, the balcony makes sense only in the summer. In the winter it's likely to have four feet of snow on it. The hotel would not be a bad choice in the neighborhood, even if you opt for the less expensive rooms without the balcony. It's clean enough, the staff is decent, the decor is pleasant if slightly faded. But there may be better choices. In fact, in winter we prefer to stay across the street and down a block at the more comfortable but slightly less atmospheric Hotel Chateau de l'Argoat. If you do stay in the neighborhood, don't miss Parc LaFontaine, a great place for a stroll or a run. In winter there is ice skating in a pond with high embankments that protect skaters from the wind.
