Staff helpful and most spoke perfect English. Internet only available in the lobby and you need help if you don't speak German to use the computer. Staff very helpful with this. I would rate the hotel higher except that it was the only one we stayed at on this trip ( out of 5 hotels in different cities ) where breakfast was not included unlike 8 years ago.

The rooms are spacious, well laid out and the beds very comfortable and with excellent lighting for reading, which is a major issue for me.

Previously in Berlin, I had stayed at the Hotel Unter den Linden, and found it to be satisfactory at best. It felt more like a pension than a hotel. So I lucked out and found Hotel Gendarm! It's a truly lovely hotel. My room really was more like a suite, with a separate sleeping area, and a small kitchen type arrangement. The views out the front of the Gendarmenmarkt are spectacular and it's close to everything, including the U-bahn, which is literally across the street. The windows are big and open easily. Everything was clean and in good working order. It's a small hotel, very quiet. They lock the door at night and you must use your key to get in the front door, but then again a lot of the smaller hotels in Europe are like that. The room service was wonderful and this was a very comfortable and nice hotel. I will definitely stay here again. I heard no noises at night, the bathroom was decent size. I didn't try the breakfast because I was feeling afraid to use my not-very-good German. Really nice hotel.", "Date": "January 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "savannah, ga", "Title": "\u201cgreat location, lovely hotel\u201d", "Author": "hawa", "ReviewID": "UR3544632", "Content": "a lovely hotel in a beautiful square a few blocks from the unter der linden. the room was attractively furnished and the breakfasts were fantastic. close to most of the sights of berlin and many excellent restaurants. a u-bahn stop is across the street and it is a few stops to the zoo bahnhof. i would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "June 12, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Gendarm nouveau", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d231107-Reviews-Hotel_Gendarm_nouveau-Berlin.html", "Price": "$130 - $248*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Charlottenstr 61</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10117</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "231107", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/4e/f8/4ef875d1949efae041083362400019c56large.jpg"}}
