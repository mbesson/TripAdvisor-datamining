In the U.S. I'd expect more for the price. We stayed in two rooms -- a smaller one with a view right onto a wall of the Roman Forum -- pretty neat. We also spent one night in a triple room, which was spacious for two but possibly a bit small for three adults (the third small bed is up a couple of steps on a little platform, which creates a nice space for a kid, I'd imagine). The triple was around the corner from the main hotel -- you're buzzed in by the front desk. Others here have worried about the security of that, but I didn't feel threatened for a second. Neither room was particularly well-appointed, I'd say. Both had air conditioning that worked, but only after a call to the front desk to fix a tripped breaker somewhere in the building that prevented it from switching on occasionally. Bathrooms, as has been said elsewhere, are rather small, with a *very* small shower in our standard double room. What's weird is that the shower could have been fine, but it's built so that half of it is sort of raised up, as though designed for you to take a bath sitting down on one side. If you stand in one side or the other, there's not much room to move. Odd. The water pressure and heat were fine, though. Anyway, you are not paying for decor or showers at the Nerva, you're paying for location, and it's great. You are steps away from the Forum. Easy three-block or so walk to the Colosseum. Longer walks (warning, a bit hilly at times, but no problem for us) to the Trevi Fountain, Pantheon, Pizza Navona, and the great restaurants of the Monti area. There's a nearby metro station and two places to catch buses to the Vatican for a Euro per trip. The front desk staff was always helpful in directing us to these various places. They also called us cabs and made one dinner reservation for us, all with a smile. We also liked the little tucked-away shopping area down a narrow street around the corner. Cool little glass shops and the like. Decent breakfast, the Italian hotel standard, with bread, toast, croissants, meats, cheeses, juice, espresso or tea, yogurt and a nice wedge of custard cake. There's wifi in the lobby. They're happy to let you sit in there and check email, etc. It gets a bit crowded there in the morning as people check in and out of their rooms and have breakfast, but pleasant enough.

And all the staff - the servers in the dining room, the cleaners were friendly, courteous and helpful. I travelled in July so I appreciated coming back at night to a cool room. Yes, the bathroom was small. Who cares? The bathroom was also modern and pristine. It was a great convenience to have breakfast in the hotel - coffee, prosciutto, cheese, croissants and other breads, fruit, yogurt, cake. Booking online I got a great rate. I think the walk-in rate is pretty high. This was a lovely hotel and one of the highlights of my first trip to Rome.

Luckily, the hotel itself is also amazing. When we booked, we knew that we would be in the annexe round the corner (there was a small discount as there is no reception or wifi there), but it is like being in your own Roman apartment and you trot down to the hotel for breakfast. This review is therefore based on an annexe room and we cannot speak for rooms in the main building. We had booked a double room but (presumably as January is quiet) were upgraded to a room with one double and two twin beds. The bathroom was long and thin, but the shower (no bath) was double-size so plenty of room, with good toiletries and towels, plus a heated towel rail. Sadly, the hairdryer was one of those dreadful elephant trunk things that is about as powerful as an elderly asthmatic breathing on your hair, but a minor quibble for a four night stay. The room looked out onto a small rooftop courtyard and because it was up a side street off the remarkably busy road that the main hotel is on, was extremely quiet. There was the usual noise from the other residents (not just hotel guests but people who live in the rest of the building) - shoes on hard floors etc, but all perfectly bearable. We specified a non-smoking room (although it came with a ashtray) but the room over the hallway was obviously a smoking room and made the hall and stairs, and our own room, smell of smoke sometimes The bed (we only used the one!) was comfortable with spare pillows and blankets, and the curtains provided a good blackout. There were no drawers for clothes but plenty of hangers in the wardrobe so we just used the other beds as suitcase-rests. One negative point was that although the TV had some 200-odd channels, there was not one in English. Obviously we don't go to Rome and stay in our room watching TV all day, but just one English news channel would have been good... Breakfast, as mentioned, in the main building (so just hope it doesn't rain too hard as you run round) is in a small room with about 6 tables: not too bad at this time of year but we imagine there might be queueing in higher season. Coffee, tea or hot chocolate, and the expected bread, ham, cheese, crispbreads, cake, croissants and slices of fresh orange, melon and kiwi. The staff were all very friendly and spoke varying levels of English (our Italian needs improvement) and all in all, we hope to stay at the Nerva again and again. You are a 5 or 10 minute walk from the Colosseum, Forum and Vittoriano, and we walked up to the Villa Borghese which took about half an hour (depending on how distracted you are by the treasures of this wonderful city).", "Date": "February 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cHistory on the doorstep and Friendly Service\u201d", "Author": "mrpsmith77", "ReviewID": "UR94869702", "Content": "A smallish but friendly Hotel located on the edge of the ancient forums of Rome.

Some of the walls are three & 400 hundred years old! A family owns the place, and an incredibly friendly staff will help you find restaurants, serve breakfast, or pour a glass of wine or espresso during the day. Pros: walking distance to any major attraction in Rome. Includes the standard fare of an Italian breakfast: ham, cheese, toast, coffee, juice, yogurt. The owner brought grapes in for breakfast from his own garden. A small bar is open during day to pour a glass of wine or make you a great espresso. Rooms were quiet and large enough. Beds ok, a bit hard for me but fine. I am a bit spoiled with Hilton beds but I slept fine and I liked that the drapes kept the room dark while sleeping. The room was quiet at night even though we were right on a street. Free wifi in the breakfast/bar area. The bathroom was fine, though the shower was sooo small if you drop the soap, ya sort of have to squat to get it..or do without the soap!. But rather than be annoyed, be charmed. I found it cute that the tiny shower was in a bathroom that had a sink, toiletries, hairdryer, a toilet and a bidet. It just seemed that over the many years and rebuilding, this particular room had a tiny shower. Worked fine though. The overall hotel has so much history with it, so be amazed, take some time and enjoy. The cost was nearly 300 euros so not cheap, and one has to weigh convenience with cost. We found great restaurants, amazing sites, friendly people and all we had to do was walk a few blocks. But you may need to go outside city limits to find a cheaper alternative.

And so to price....We booked 3 months ahead and paid 124 euros a night just after the busy Easter week. This seems fair to me for a 3 star hotel in this location. However, the headline rate is over 230 euros which is quite rediculous. When our flight was cancelled and we needed to stay an extra 4 nights there was much umming and aahing before they eventually offered us the same room at 160 euros. A quick check on venere.com showed they were now booking at 234! However, it also showed the Hotel Forum Cavalieri just round the corner at 120. So we moved and had a bigger room and a buffet breakfast for the rest of our extended stay (see my review)", "Date": "May 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cHotel Nerva takes great care of guests\u201d", "Author": "genlee33", "ReviewID": "UR62329152", "Content": "The hotel was recommended by a friend and the other Tripadvisor recommendations sold me.

The bed was actually comfortable enough, but when we asked for extra pillows, we were only given one and told that there were no more to give. I dont' think that two extra pillows is an unreasonable request. The location is probably the best thing, as it's literally a stone's throw from the Roman Forum.

There were 2 single beds up in the loft and one small bed next to the queen bed in the main room. The bathroom was quite large with a tub and shower combined, sink, toilet and bidet.

Happily our room was already available, so we checked in and freshened up before we began our explorations of Rome. Hotel Nerva could not be better situated.

Most all the ruins in central Rome are within walking distance of the hotel, as are Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, and many museums and galleries and good shopping areas. Our room was a good size, very clean, and nicely appointed. A room safe was provided, as well as a minibar with reasonably priced items. The bathroom was very tight in this unit - the towel warmer projected out from the wall and got me a number of times. The plus was that there was a bathtub - could do a little soaking to get rid of sore muscles after walking the city for hours. Toiletries provided were very nice and maid service was excellent. Breakfast was good - very adequate. I cannot eat dairy products, so my wife would take the cheese and I would take the meats. Breakfast included good made-on-the-spot caffes, yoghurt, a fruit plate, meat and cheese plate, a piece of cake for each person, small grilled cheese and meat sandwiches, toast, and cornettos. Certainly plenty of food to give energy for the day's explorations. The best thing about Hotel Nerva is its staff. The entire staff, mainly family members, were as friendly and helpful as any staff I have found. We were always warmly greeted. Restaurant recommendations were great (and there are many within very close proximity). The desk clerk happily called to make reservations for us.

The intimacy of the hotel was a welcoming addition after the chaotic hustle and bustle of a day in Rome. We had a clean and airy room with a big double bed (by Italian standards) and a single, with plenty of room to move around.

It is within six block walking distance of the subway, and an ideal location at great value for the cost for exploring Rome. We took the bus and subway in from the airport: it's good to have a map printed so that you can find the street: it's a bit hidden down a quiet side street. The desk staff is friendly and informative: there is a small elevator to the upper rooms,but steps along the hallways. The rooms are clean and comfortable, but simple and modestly sized: the beds took much of the space. There is a TV and minibar, a safe is in the closet. The bathroom is clean and functional; the shower is tiny but has abundant water. There is a sitting area with free wireless internet access located next to the front desk: the innkeepers have a bar for drinks on request, and evening spent there catching up on email and watching football were very nice. Breakfast is served in the morning: fruit, rolls, a selection of meats and cheeses, juice and coffee. It's a good time to mingle with other guests and to get tips for the day's touring (one woman suggested a shortcut from the vatican museum to the sanctuary that was invaluable). The desk staff is very helpful in suggesting local restaurants: two that were very good nearby are the \"alle Carrette\" for truly excellent pizza and \"Taverna Romana\" for a real local experience with fantastic italian food. We rented scooters neaby from RentScotter that really made for a fun day at little cost.
