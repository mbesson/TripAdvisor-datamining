I booked this hotel as a 3 star hotel on Hotwire. Upon my arrival and viewing that it was a motor lodge style motel I was hoping for the best. Check in went smoothly, unfortunately that is where the smooth roaded ended and I ended up on a pot hole filled journey the rest of the way. Driving to the back wing of this motel right next to garbage dumpsters with trash bags overflowing them was the location of my room. 5 minutes after arriving to the room with my family (wife, 9 year old, 9 month old) I recieved a knock on our door with someone saying I was in his room. I called down to the front desk to let them know someone was claiming this was there room and that I am not opening the door. He said that they already told the guy to come back to the front desk and that he assigned him the wrong room. After that debacle was over I had a moment to look over this beaten up room that was claimed to have been renovated. Hey Seven Seas- putting a flat screen in a room and new white sheets does not equal renovation. The first thing I noticed was exposed wire hanging out of a hole in the mirror wall. Yep this renovated room had a fulll wall made of a mirror like in the 70's. There was a cut out and a mirror plate that was supposed to cover it, but alas the mirror plate dangled by one bolt exposing the wires. I sat down on the bed , and thats when I really knew I was in trouble. The mattress litterally sank to about an inch above the box spring. The softest bed I have ever encountered. Ever. Not lumpy, just like a huge pillow. This is not a good thing and for those that are wondering I weigh 170 lbs. I next reached for the remote, it does not work. I call the front desk which rang for litterally 1 minute. I disconnected and tried agian a few minutes later and informed them of the TV not working. They sent a maintenance man to room who showed me the \"trick\" that he claimed the FD should have known which is to turn the TV on mannually and then you can use the remote. I love tricks. I pointed out the exposed wire and told him he could fix it in the morning since it was about 10PM and I needed to get my young family to bed. Woke up the next morning after the worst night of sleep in my lfe and hoped in the shower. Cla CLANK- Thats the sound of the loose towel rack falling down. OK.....I just put it back up and hand tightended the screw back on. Midway through my 5 minute shower the hot water abruptly halted sending streams of ice cold water on me. Classier by the minute. Water pressure was also an issue. I called Hotwire at this point and told them this hotel is not acceptable as a 3 star. Expedia (parent company) lists them a two and half. Nothing they can do apparantly and direct me to the FD. They also do a call for me to the fd. I call down and explanin that I need a new mattress in the room as this one is garbage. she says she will take care of it. Also explain that challenges I have had. They offer to move me. We had plans to go to Sea World this day so I was not wasting another minute of our trip on this non sense at that time. When we return to the hotel after our day out. I am given a key to a new room. We head over to check it out. Same exact room set up with same issues as the first sans the exposed wire. At this point I just gave up, the hassel of moving was just to great considering that this run down product is standard here. I asked them to send some one to my old room to fix the exposed wire issue and I would deal with this for the last night of my stay.

Our room was toward the back and on the second floor, so we didn't experience a lot of highway noise. The room was very clean, but could use some minor maintenance, there's some rust around the bathroom fixtures, loose doorknobs, the security latch needs replacement, etc. Overall, the room was adequate, small but certainly serviceable. The biggest complaint was that the room was cold and the heater was of little value. We had to ask for an additional blanket, which they provided. Our request to the maid for a blanket, went unheeded so we had to call down to the front desk when we returned that night. The response was \"we'll see if we have any extras.\" A maintenance person came by shortly to deliver the \"extra sheets we requested.\" He seemed surprised when I told him that we needed a blanket, not sheets. Who needs extra sheets? He finally return a few minutes later with a blanket. The on site restaurant is so-so. The food is OK, but a bit pricey for what you get but the service was very friendly and attentive. Prior to booking, we were concerned by other reviews about unfriendly service and dreadfully slow internet access. Perhaps we were lucky, or the management since responded to feedback, but the front desk staff was very courteous and friendly and the Internet access was amongst the fastest and easiest to connect to that we've had at any hotel. No complaints there at all. The biggest downsides is that the plumbing is very noisy and you can hear water running anytime a nearby room uses water. One advantage of a hotel at Hotel Circle over lodging at the more touristy areas (such as the Gaslamp District in San Diego) is that you are nearby to neighborhood stores such as a CVS pharmacy, Target, Staples along with non-tourist restaurants. This is an advantage if you need toothpaste, another pair of socks, or other incidentals since you can get it without paying the outrageous prices found in hotel gift shops/convenience stores. Also, if you just want to grab a quick bite to eat without the high price of vacation spots. This is a big advantage if you are traveling on business. It is only a few minutes drive to Old Town, the Gaslamp District, Balboa Park, and other attractions. We chose this hotel because of price, and we would stay again. We use hotels for sleeping, changing, and showering. If you're looking for a place to stay where you'll be hanging out, using a gym, and a spa; this probably isn't the place for you (although the pool and jacuzzi looked inviting); but if you want a lower price place that's convenient and clean, this is a good bet.", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "California, USA", "Title": "\u201cHotels.com 50% off one night $60\u201d", "Author": "MeuterMedia", "ReviewID": "UR122044577", "Content": "Don't pay more than $75 for this older complex. try to get a room in the back and upstairs (section 400) it's away from the freeway - but you still have the noice from the neighbors. including car noice from the cars parked infront of your room. i stayed in a small unit #441 - 2 beds, old chipped bathtub, older TV, very noisy neigbhours, banging doors, late night arrivals car alarms, you name it.

The staff never smiled, tried to avoid you at all costs, and if you aren't honest, you could easily walk out of there without paying your bill and nobody would notice nor care. The food is quite expensive too. They offer you a 15% off discount card which makes the prices a little bit easier to take but it's still pricey. Portions were \"American-sized\" (big).

I have stayed at many hotels and honestly I have never had a complaint. My boyfriend and I stayed at the Best Western Seven Seas hotel recently in San Diego, California. I had paid $100 for a night and looked at the pictures and it seemed like a nice hotel that was in a good location. We we got there were completely shocked of how dirty the room was and how unsafe we felt. The door to our room had a 1 inch gap all the way around it so we could hear everything that was going on outside (this was like a motel not a hotel, you had to access rooms from outside). The sheets on the bed were scratchy and when you walked on the floor you could feel hair on your feet. The water never heated up when I took a shower and the towels gave me a rash. BUT it gets better.... At about 2:30 am someone began banging on our hotel door and you could hear the clacking of high heels outside. Somebody was walking back and floor and knocking on everyone's door and was screaming. Keep in mind that our door had a 1 inch gap all the way around it so we could hear EVERYTHING. My boyfriend finally woke up and answered the door. When he opened the door, a hooker was standing outside saying that she had lost the key to room and didn't know which one it was. Then she asked if she could stay in our room and of course we shut and locked the door. In the morning we left as fast as we could. I would never recommend anyone staying here EVER. I am not a picky person by any means and I was disgusted out of my mind. If you want to stay in San Diego and not pay an arm and leg for a hotel just pay $20-$50 extra a night to stay at a Marriott or a Holiday Inn Express.

We arrived at the pick-up spot 15 min. early and waited about 30 min. before calling the hotel and asking if we had been waiting in the wrong place. The receptionist said the van should have been there but since it wasn't she checked and found out that the driver had not left and had no plans to drive out to get us. Evidently because we had not signed up in the morning for the van, and even though the driver had nothing else to do, we were left waiting for nothing and ended up taking a cab. This was not an isolated incident. In talking to another hotel guest, when she made her motel reservation, she was promised shuttle service to a special event, but was later told the shuttle did not serve the location she needed to go. We understood that their priority is shuttling people to and from the airport, but it seems the receptionist wasn't smart enough to add our name to 'the list'. One hand doesn't seem to know what the other is doing. I will definitely not recommend that anyone stay at this hotel. However, the restaurant adjacent to the hotel has good food and service that is outstanding. The big San Diego Blackout happened on our first day at this motel. Senad Kolenovic, the Food & Beverage Supervisor, welcomed us like family: gave us a table by the window where there was light; he served us ice water, bar snacks, and cold sandwiches.

Netflix did not even remotely work, nor did google in any timely manner - my phone provided our internet, which I have to pay for separately. <> The room was absolutely tiny, it barely fit a queen sized bed and two chairs. It was, however, clean and nice for what it was. <> There was a refrigerator, but it was not turned on... so by the time it was cold we no longer had any use for it. <> There were less toiletry items than a mid-level motel - 2 soaps and 1 very small shampoo, both low quality. <> There were only two towels and two pillows, the bare essentials. They knew there were two of us a week before checking in. After a trip to the pool our towels had a layer of chlorine on them, which we continued to use the next morning unfortunately as that was our only option. <> The faucets are extremely loud - we could hear every single one of our neighbors washing their hands at odd hours of the night and morning. <> As I write this review (on my phone's internet) I also hear a vacuum next door (through the door that separates our room from the next) - It is 8:20 in the morning on a Saturday.

The bed was a mixed bag. The mattress was decently comfortable, but the pillows were hard and a bit too large, forcing my head to rest at a funky angle. I woke up with a sore neck after the first night; the second and third nights, I used the plush beluga whale I'd gotten at Sea World for a pillow and had better nights' sleep.

Inside the \"bedroom\" was the smallest \"Queen\" sized bed I'd seen, but it was still big enough for me (6 ft. tall) and my wife. The bed was pretty hard ... after the second night our bodies were beginning to feel pretty soar. Overall we felt pretty comfortable in the room and would definitely stay there again.", "Date": "May 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place for the Price\u201d", "Author": "Mzlady09", "ReviewID": "UR107599390", "Content": "We stayed here while we were in San Diego for a wedding.

There was also a pool and 2 whirlpools. we were right next to the high way which was great since we could get everywhere we needed to go relatively quickly. The seven seas cafe was great for lunch, and they had daily specials. Dinner was kind of expensive and we ended up eating elsewhere. Their breakfst was also a little high so we walked a couple blocks down to this plaza called Mission valley and there was a place that had breakfast for 6.99. The best part about the hotel was the free shuttle thet you can use to get to the airport or other attractions. Its for come first serve so call and let them know what time you need it in advance. I noticed that a lot of reviews complained about poor customer service, and we did not experience that. We got there 3 hours before check in, and the woman at the desk called one of the maids to find out if a room was ready for us.

The TV had cable but with very limited channels, the good stuff (i.e movies and recent episodes of your favorite shows) cost money. There is a computer desk in the room that served adequately for my lap top. However, I had to use the outlet behind the TV, that luckily had a 6-prong outlet to plu in my laptop and blue-tooth for the night. Service- The like to change your sheets every other day unless you specifically request that it be changed daily. They did not leave any plastic bags in the trash bins but luckily I brought some plastic grocery bags that I implemented as trash bags. The Bed- I got a full size bed that needed replacing and only 2 standard synthetic-fill pillows. Food- There is a restaurant next to the front desk that is decent. There is NO complimentary breakfast and NO complimentary afternoon snacks or drinks at this hotel. Parking- Parking is abundant but the spaces are very compact and perhaps parking away from your room might be a better idea especially if you need space to get things in and out of your car. And, also, there is no elevator to the second floor and some of the stairwells to the second-floor looked as though it was ready to collapse. So be careful. Amenities- I saw a pool but it was closed for some type of work, I know this hotel had a gym but I never saw it, and they had about 2 hot-tubs.", "Date": "June 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia Beach, VA", "Title": "\u201cI Enjoyed My Stay\u201d", "Author": "tmann01", "ReviewID": "UR63206448", "Content": "I stayed at the Best Western Seven Seas for a couple weeks on a business trip.

The food in the restaurant was good, albeit expensive. The wait staff, with one exception - a warm and chaming young lady from Eastern Europe - was pedestrian. I felt very comfortable with the 5 police officers who met one day for lunch. It indicated to me that the restaurant had a good local reputation for its food. The pool area was nice and pleasant to relax at. Free internet was nice as well. Management is concerned with their image and were quick to my complaint to Best Western headquarters - see below. CON: The room was too small and very uncomfortable and every request to upgrade to a larger room was met with disdain and \"if you're not happy with the room, go somewhere else,\" or \"Don't let the door hit you in the back.\" This happened 3 days in a row. They were rude and obnoxious. On the last day I requested a late checkout and was treated, once again, very badly by the Front Desk Staff - they were extremely rude and obnoxious. One of them actually sneered at me. I asked to speak to the manager and was told he was unavailable, but I did speak to a Customer Service Clerk and she was very helpful. We were allowed a late checkout (5:45 p.m.) and were fully charged for an extra night. Oh, and I never did get to speak to the manager. When I returned home, I called Best Western and filed a complaint. To my suprise 3 hours later, I received a phone call from the manager who was too busy to talk to me that day. We had a pleasant and fruitful exchange re my experience - he apologized and we discussed the need for better training of his front desk staff. I was not offered any consideration to return and the hotel never forwarded my stay to Best Western and I never received credit for my stay in their Rewards program. I have stayed in literally hundreds of hotels (including BW) all around the country and I've never been treated so shabbily. I was positively impressed with the speed and personal response to my complaint (Kudos to Steve!), but it does not mitigate how I was treated. Hopefully the staff has been retrained and have been taught the proper treatment of guests and without those guests, they would not have jobs.I would not recommend this hotel to friends or family, because I can not be sure that they will not receive the same nasty treatment I did. Lastly, prior to San Diego, I stayed at the BW Carriage Inn in Sherman Oaks for 6 nights and the front desk staff went out of their way to make our stay pleasant and that our business was appreciated.

When we arrived at the room we noticed a no smoking sign, I called the front desk and was told there were no smoking rooms available even though I could see an entire building of non occupied smoking rooms just across the parking lot. I was also told that a fine of 75.00 would be imposed if we smoked in the room. A complaint call to Hotels.com resulted in a partial refund. The room itself was clean and comfortable, well laid out with ample lighting, clean bathroom and standard furniture: 2 chairs, small table, chest of drawers, a night stand or two and a bed. No complaints there, however no elevator meant having to lug our heavy suitcases up the outside stairs. The motel has a restaurant which we did not go to. It also has some nice greenery lined pathways that lead to a nice pool area with umbrella covered tables & chairs which made for a relaxing place to sit while we figured out how to use our new video camera. We signed up for the free shuttle to take us to the cruise ship terminal and the next morning the kindly driver assisted us with the luggage and off we went. After our cruise we were picked up by the motel's shuttle and we spent 2 more nights at motel before driving back home. This time they had opened the long building in the back (where the smoking rooms are) which made the stay nicer since we did not have to go outside to smoke as we did before. The second room we had was also clean and comfortable, it contained a desk and TV, one chair and table, 2 night stands and the bed. One wall was covered in mirror. There was an alcove/closet where suitcases could be stored and the bathroom was divided where the comode and tub was behind a door, separated from the sink. They had a coffee maker on the sink's counter with makings for coffee or tea, and I believe there was a tiny frige under the sink (could be wrong on that). The one thing that caused me to book the room was finding out they allow you to leave you car there during your cruise.... at no extra charge! Just leave your keys with them at the desk. We were off on the cruise for 8 nights and my car did not appear to be touched at all. All in all it was a good experience to stay at the Best Western Seven Seas in San Diego, even though we were unable to smoke in the room the first night.

The room was small, but had a lot of amenities, many of which worked. The complementary wireless Internet worked (although at just 30 kbytes/sec). The coffee maker didn't work. The mini-fridge was good. The shower lacked pressure but was serviceable. We didn't notice noise from other rooms. The room was hot and humid upon check in. The air conditioner tried hard to cool it down, but it breathed the smell of damp mold. The room had that run-down look motels get when they are past their prime. It was clean; as clean as they could make it, but it was just old. We saw canine cops outside the lobby. I wonder why canine cops seem to hang out there. Our reservations promised a single Queen. The bed in Room 353 wasn't a Queen; it was size Full a.k.a. Double. I called the front desk and asked whether they happened to have a room with a Queen; they answered that room 353 had a Queen. I explained it wasn't a Queen. They said it was a Queen according to the computer. The bed in 353 is a Full, as anyone can discover by measuring. I got a tape measure. The bed is 55 inches wide -- industry standard Full or Double. The front desk gave me the key to an alternative room which the computer also said was a single Queen. I checked that room -- it also had a Full bed. Perhaps this hotel has a lot of these small rooms with Fulls, and they're falsely advertising them as Queens and hoping nobody notices. I certainly saw two such rooms, anyway. The pool closes at 10:00 PM but this hotel offers a 24-hour hot tub, which I think is a great idea. On Saturday night I went to the hot tub, but it was occupied by 10 navy men, with another 15 sailors hanging around. Those boys had been drinking, but they were OK; they weren't too rowdy. San Diego has a big military presence. I decided not to go in the hot tub with them, though. We wound up staying in 353. The bed was too small; we felt cheated.
