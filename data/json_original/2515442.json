I have never been to a hotel where the staff were so helpful but also personable at the same time. When we mentioned at breakfast that we left some flip flops out by the pool the day before and needed to find the lost and found, our server went outside, found them and brought them to our table on a tray! Bikes (free rental) were promptly brought out when we asked for them. Warm freshly baked cookies are out every afternoon. Crystal Pier is nearby and we saw dolphins playing. The amusement park in Mission Beach was a fun thing to do for a couple of hours, and is just down the boardwalk. Anyway Pacific Terrace is a small sweet hotel that I highly recommend.

My husband booked this trip for our family and chose this hotel based on the positive reviews he read. The 3 story hotel is located right on Pacific Beach. It literally takes you less than 3 minutes to get from your hotel room to the ocean. It was very low key and uncrowded; a boutique-type gem. Upon our afternoon arrival, we were told our room preference was not available. We booked through Expedia and were told our room preference was not guaranteed because of that. The staff worked immediately to remedy the situation and placed us in a king jr suite with a full ocean view for the first night and then moved us to the room preference we had originally booked with an upgraded view. Every staff member we encountered, from the front desk to the person who brought us extra pillows, were friendly, competent and eager to help. Great staff! The rooms were upgraded and very clean. All amenities were provided that you would expect from a high end hotel including large beach towels for our use. The beds were very comfortable and the decor lovely. My only complaint would have been the use of bedspreads as opposed to duvets. The entire hotel was very well maintained, including the pool and lounge area. The pool was an ok size, no frills, but very clean with comfortable chaise loungers with cushions. And of course with a spectacular view of the Ocean! For a small fee the hotel provides beach chairs and beach cruisers. Children's beach toys are free to use. The beach in front of the hotel was never over crowed and we always had a front row seat to some great surfing. Parking was also convenient located in an underground garage beneath the hotel. We didnt eat breakfast at the hotel because we were off exploring the area each morning. Be sure to try Kono's Cafe just south of the hotel.

We arrived at the Pacific Terrace before our room was ready but they were very accommodating in holding our baggage and letting us use the facilities and the pool. They also gave us a nice room upgrade and a bottle of wine as we were celebrating our anniversary, which was a nice touch. I can't say enough about how welcoming and helpful the staff is at the Pacific Terrace -- they all seemed genuine too, like they really wanted to help and were not just asking because they were getting a paycheck to do so. The room was incredibly clean and comfortable. We loved that the hotel offers bicycles that you can take along the boardwalk, it was so relaxing and fun. We didn't stay by the pool much, as we really wanted to enjoy the beach and boardwalk and check out the san diego bar scene and attractions (the Zoo is a must -- it's just incredible and not like any zoo you've ever been to!) , but the pool area looked nice. As for San Diego, I'm so in love with this city. The people are the friendliest and most happy people i've ever met in the U.S. I can definitely see my husband and I relocating to SD down the road. if you're comfortable using public transportation, don't be afraid to take the local bus to any attractions or anywhere for that matter -- it's MUCH cheaper than a taxi and it's very convenient. The bus stop is a few seconds walk from the Pacific Terrace and the transit system in san diego seemed very easy to use.

The rooms have 2 double beds which are amazingly comfortable once you manage to clamber onto them - the heavy wooden frames around them are just at the right height for me to bang my shins every time I attempted to get on the bed. The view of the ocean from the balcony is fabulous - we left the door open to fall asleep to the roar of the waves crashing against the beach. Our room was almost right in the centre of the hotel - which meant that we were over the top of the entrance to the pool - the balconies are great but they aren't very private or quiet - indeed when there are people in the pool, especially kids playing, it can be very noisy. Service was reasonable - but not exceptional. When we booked we had a rate with a free glass of wine which didn't ever materialise - although to be honest we kept forgetting to mention it. There were a couple of other niggles which irritated - they ran out of the only decent beer they had in the bar - Sam Adams (they only did four different beers, one of which was a \"lite\") and 2 days later when we tried again for a beer they still hadn't got any (the bartender was a bit embarrassed and offered to pop down the shop!). The other niggle was that we asked about a late checkout - it was a quiet time so they agreed to an hour later than normal - 12noon, but if we wanted a 3pm checkout we would have to pay just under $100.

Their full ocean view rooms have balconies that are basically on top of the ocean, and are AMAZING for people watching if you get a room on floor 2 or 3 on the right-hand side of the hotel. Try not to get a room right in the middle of the U shaped hotel, as those are farther back from the beach and you end up just spying on people in the pool when you should be enjoying the sunset. I never pay for parking, as I'm always able to find free parking within a few blocks. I also never eat the food at the hotel, as San Diego is chock-full of marvelous restaurants. My partner and I are honestly slightly embarrassed for liking this hotel so much. We're in our early 30s, which we think is far too early to be staying in a Tommy Bahama themed hotel. The upside of that is that there isn't a party scene at night. It's always quiet, we sleep with the balcony doors wide open, and when we venture down to the jacuzzi we always have it to ourselves. The one downside is the customer service. The hotel staff tends to be reluctant to allow early check-ins or late check-outs. They also won't let you book a specific room unless you pay a $50 fee -- so even if we book months in advance, we aren't guaranteed one of the right-hand side oceanfront rooms. Even though we are repeat customers! I also never get free upgrades, even when better rooms are available :-( My final gripe: my partner called today to find out about availability this coming Monday. He called at about 6pm and was given a special unadvertised rate by the person working the desk. He said he would call back in a bit to confirm. When he called back a different person answered the phone and refused to honor the rate he had been quoted just a few hours earlier, even though the room (a King Suite) was still available. We felt like we were being jerked around a bit, so we booked a \"Surf Pad\" room at a different beach-front hotel just a smidge down the boardwalk. We're bummed out, because that hotel is swankier, but also louder and douchier. That said, they are much more accommodating about early check-ins and they don't bait and switch on price.", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Gatos, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Friendly Staff, Kids loved it!!\u201d", "Author": "Chris B", "ReviewID": "UR122843465", "Content": "I stayed 3 nights at the Pac Terrace with my wife and 2 small children (8,6) and we had a blast!

You can park your car and walk to restuarants, bars and shopping. Once I was surprised with an upgrade to a beautiful suit. This place understands good business and how to keep customers coming back. I have told other hotels that they should take some lessons from Pacific Terrace, see how a good hotel is run and go back and train their staff. I can't wait until my next visit.

The hot tub was also nice. We were disappointed in our room. At $500 a night and all the glowing reviews (#2 in San Diego!), our expectations were high.

Nice big room, gorgeous HUGE furniture - 2 beds, big closet and sink/vanity area with an enormous bathroom (oddly laid out with a giant empty space where there should have been another vanity and sink) a large shower and toilet. The balcony overlooked the pool and hot tub and the view of the Pacific was perfect! The hotel is right on the path that runs along the cliffs and is close to the Crystal Pier and lots of restaurants and bars. The hotel had a concierge who was very helpful with directions, maps and advice. The free breakfast was OK - nothing fancy.

We chose the Pacific Terrace Hotel for both its luxury and its position and it didn't let us down. When we arrived the check-in was handled swiftly and perfectly and after a long drive south to SD it was so pleasant to be able to walk in and check in so quickly. I needed parking and I used the onsite basement parking, You can unload and put your luggage strait in the lift up to your room. We had requested a room overlooking the sea and that is exactly what we got with a balcony and seating to enjoy the view. The reception staff were excellent and extremely helpful we used the beach chairs and umbrellas, which you can borrow from reception, a couple of times and nothing was any trouble. The staff all seem to enjoy what they do and are very helpful. We even had animals created from the towels placed on top of the TV unit or on the bed when the room had been cleaned which really was a nice surprise. It was particularly nice to be able to open the doors of the balcony and hear the waves of the Pacific crashing on the shore while lying in bed. The position of the hotel is perfect, its right on the board walk to Pacific Beach but not in the centre of activity so you are not disturbed in any way as you might be if you were based more directly in the middle of things. Our room was quite small for a family of 4 but we managed fine. The room had a coffee maker and fridge which is great. There was also a 42 inch HD TV which was also great. There are no restaurants in this hotel but having said that, the breakfast is well done and ample. This means that you have to consider that you have go out and find somewhere to eat every time. This is perhaps the only negative, all the restaurants we sampled in the near vicinity are mediocre at best. You have to go at least three blocks back into SD to find somewhere to have a good meal. Granted there are quite a few restaurants along the Pacific Beach boardwalk but they are not great as it seems that they are quite happy with the passing trade they have and seem to cater for the drinking customer more. The best we found was the Green Flash and they got our order wrong but what we had was OK. The pool is nice, clean and gets sun pretty well all day.

Housekeeping did a great job. A few times, we left in the morning and stopped back at the room fairly early, like 12:30, and the room would already have been cleaned. I stayed in a partial ocean view room for 6 nights at $420 a night. I didn't know it came with a kitchenette, so that was a nice surprise. It had a small frig, microwave, coffeemaker, sink, and plates, bowls, and utensils. It came in handy. The balcony overlooked the ocean on the left and directly underneath and to the right was grass and a view of another building. The Pacific Beach area can be noisy at night. I left the patio door open to hear the ocean overnight. Drunken carousers screaming below at like 3 am woke me up the first night. I came to San Diego for comic con, and the hotel was close to everything I wanted to see. I don't think it took longer than 10 minutes to drive to the convention center, the zoo, Sea World, La Jolla, etc. There are also a lot of restaurants you can walk to from the hotel within a few blocks. There's a Trader Joe's a couple blocks away as well, so you can buy drinks, etc. to bring to the zoo or the other attractions that want to charge you an insane amount for a snack or bottle of water. Parking isn't too bad if you don't mind sometimes having to walk a block or two. There is a garage at the hotel that is $20 a night, but we just parked on the street, and it was fine. It's well marked where you can park and can't, mostly only signs for street cleaning (no parking first Wed. of the month sort of thing). The staff was really nice about answering questions about getting around and parking and didn't push us to pay for the garage, which is what I expected. They provide a lot of nice little touches which I appreciated: free iced tea and cookies, 4 beach towels in your room, HBO, everyone on staff makes a point of saying hello. The only thing I can come up with negative is that they were doing construction on the pool area, so I didn't get a chance to use it. But it wasn't a big deal, since the beach is right there. Also it would have been nice if there was another entrace other than the lobby. It was quite a hike to get to my room each time on the other side of the building.

We rode our bikes along the beach path from the hotel all the way to the south end of Mission Beach and around to the bay side and back up (more than once). The area through Mission Beach was a party crowd July 4th weekend, and pretty crowded. On the second trip we found the alley just behind the first row of houses and that sped things up.

The good news is that it lived up to its promise. The staff was more than friendly, the room was very comfortable and the location was ideal. A small reason behind our choosing this hotel was because they rented bikes on the property. We were briefly disappointed when we learned they were out of bikes when we checked at the front desk around noon. However, we were pleased when Rachel at the front desk directed us to a rental company just a couple blocks down the beach where we were able to rent for an even lower price than the hotel offered, thanks to a coupon she gave us. We didn't mind the walk to the rental location since we were already planning a long ride and a little warm-up walk wouldn't hurt. At the bike rental place, we were on our way in under 5 minutes. We also got a recommendation from Paul for a Mexican restaurant in Old Town, plus a coupon for a free appetizer. The food was great! On the downside, just minor points. There were lipstick marks on one of the glasses in our room, but otherwise the room was impeccable. Don't expect much from the excercise room. We checked it out, but decided against it. Choose a long bike ride if you want to get in some exercise. The pool was nice and but most lounge chairs were taken when we chose to visit around happy hour. However, we had a room on the first floor that was just steps from the pool and were happy when they brought our drink order to our patio where we were taking in the view.

We had a \"partial ocean view\" room which ended up being on the first floor looking out towards the pool-we could sorta see the ocean--but from my perspective I wouldn't consider it to have been a true \"partial ocean view.\" That being said..I would say to spend a few extra dollars to get a ocean view room on the 2nd or 3rd floors--that way you won't be disappointed. The room was nicely furnished, spacious, and clean. Our wireless internet was inconsistent--sometimes we could connect and stay connected without issue and other times we would lose the connection sporadically. We were not aware of the fees to park our car at the hotel prior to arriving-so that was a big surprise to us. $20 per day to park in the parking area under the hotel seemed a bit high to me--so be sure to plan on budgeting that into your travel costs. Also, when we booked our room the hotel was doing continental breakfast with the room--they stopped doing that just before we arrived. They are now charging a separate charge for a breakfast buffet ($11.50 for adults and $6 for children). We tried it one morning- there was cereal, muffins, yogurts, oatmeal, eggs, bacon, sausage, juice, milk, and coffee. It was nice to sit by the pool hearing the ocean, but for the price we felt you could do better by going a short drive to the IHOP.", "Date": "June 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento, California", "Title": "\u201cThe most amazing place on earth\u201d", "Author": "MAhmahkitty", "ReviewID": "UR113704349", "Content": "I booked this hotel and was nervous until I drove around the corner and saw the beautiful hotel.

The location is terrific, providing gorgeous ocean views and close access to the beach (note, the hotel sits above the beach, so you must use the nearby wooden staircase to get there). The room decor is plush with a tropical flair--comfortable beds, wooden louvered rolling shutters, and premium dark wood furniture. We enjoyed the huge flat screen TV and DVD player. The bath area included a large marble-topped counter and sink with large mirror, separate from the toilet and tub. The countertop housed a small fridge and also a mini-bar. Everything was sparkling clean. The balcony was oversized and included 4 wrought iron chairs and table. Our particular room faced a more southern direction, but the balcony was semi-circular in shape which allowed for a broad view. We did partially overlook the side street and a few buildings, but still had full ocean views, including some spectacular sunsets. (There are also ocean front rooms that overlook the pool area.) The pool was small, but more than adequate; the lounge chairs were comfortable and I really enjoyed being able to see the ocean waves while lounging by the pool. The hotel does not have a restaurant on-site, but there are many places to eat within walking distance. They also have a unique system with a couple of the local restaurants where you can actually charge your meal to your hotel room. There is also the option to have room service provided by nearby restaurants. There do serve breakfast, at an additional cost ($9). We enjoyed it--choice of ham and cheese omelets with breakfast potatoes, bacon or sausage and toast or waffle and bacon or sausage. Plus coffee, juice, milk, and hot chocolate. I can't say enough about the staff. Everyone at the front desk was extremely helpful and accommodating. Check-in and check-out was smooth and efficient. I was welcomed back every time I returned through the lobby. Every single staff member I encountered greeted me. I also noted that members of the staff were constantly cleaning and polishing the public areas. All in all, really top-notch. The room rates are in line with first class status, but I really felt like they went out of their way to earn it.

The room was clean and odor free (we're particular) and the accommodations were as promised. The front desk & staff were exceptionally friendly and professional. We ate breakfast there only once, and were pleased. Parking is below ground with safe, easy access to the upper floors via elevator. It was a bit chilly, so the pool & hot tub were only used once, but were very well maintained. Plenty of chairs, towels, etc. I would recommend a windbreaker or fleece this time of year, but layer! Chilly in the morning leads to some NICE warm afternoons. DON'T FORGET THE SUNSCREEN!! You'll need it! The beach is nice with lots of sunning & swimming to the south and the start of some rocky cliffs to the north...all within walking distance. If you like (or want to try) surfing, this is the place to be. Downtown San Diego is a short, easy drive, as well as some nice scenery to the north in La Jolla & Del Mar. Bring your cameras... the sunsets are INCREDIBLE. The walkway behind the hotel is great and is a nice way to head south down the beach without having to utilize the busy street/sidewalk. There are PLENTY of great restaurants & bars (most are family friendly) within walking distance, as well as a grocery store to stock up on drinks & munchies. (Our room had a small fridge that we stocked with drinks & things). We loved the laid back atmosphere and the locals were very friendly. The bar areas got a little rowdy after dark, but noting crazy, just sort of a college-type atmosphere. Don't be surprised by the amount of street bums. They re there, but they do not aggressively badger you for money. I know everyone does the zoo or Sea World, but we chose the Adventure R.I.B. rides, located in the marina behind the Sheraton across from the airport in San Diego. They offer whale & dolphin sightseeing trips as well as harbor trips and an excursion to the Mexican Coronado Islands, which is what we did. FANTASTIC!!!

We had the option of staying downtown San Diego, but we wanted to find someplace away from the hustle and bustle. Pacific Beach is an area full of character, and very laid back. We found the Pacific Terrace Hotel through TripAdvisor. This is our 2nd stay at the hotel. When we arrived, we weren't placed in the room we thought we had reserved. It was simply a difference in what we remembered when talking to the reservation agent vs. what the reservation agent had noted. Our understanding was contrary to what their room classes were. They could have easily argued their point (which technically was correct). After talking with the staff, and out of sheer goodwill and interest in pleasing us, the shifted some rooms around and were able to put us in the room we had expected. The next day we received a personally written (not a form letter) note apologizing for the mix-up and wanting to ensure we were satisfied. We needed to stay in our existing room for a couple of nights until the current guess departed our room. The thought of moving rooms wasn't appealing to us because we'd have to pack our stuff and move it. They sent us another note on the day we were to transfer rooms indicating it would be done between 11am and 1pm, and we didn't need to be present - they'd send a guest services agent to move all of our luggage. They told us to hang our clothes (which we would have done anyway) and they'd move them directly from the old closet to the new one. We basically threw our toiletries in our suitcases. All the moving was done by the guest services agent. Let me reiterate - they way their room classes were set up, they didn't need to let us transfer rooms, but they did it anyway. They also discounted the rate for a few nights, gave us a free bottle of wine and free garage parking. The staff is unbelievably friendly. We've traveled extensively for business and pleasure and have never had such wonderful service. The amenities in the room were fabulous. The bed was so comfortable, the provided a DVD player, beach towels ... everything I could think of. My wife had a sinus headache one evening and someone at the front desk offered to go to the drugstore and purchase medicine.

When we inquired about being transferred to another room because we were woken up our first two days by noisy neighbors, the staff could not have been more accomodating. Kyla was amazing and offered to move us to another room while we spent our day at Legoland. All they asked was that we pack our stuff, not to include items in the closet and refrigerator. They upgraded us to a junior suite for the inconvenience. When we returned from Legoland, all of our stuff had been moved to the new room. We really appreciated their thoughtfulness.

Spend very little more & go to the Hotel Del Coronado (we were glad we did after the 2nd night here). This place is a very beautiful 'condo' type accomodation in the wrong location (unless u are a Pacific Beach surfer dude type). No restaurant or liquor licence on premises. We did not feel safe coming back to the hotel at night. The beach is a long, steep staircase down to cold water & it's not \"combed'. The nearby restaurants have slow service & cater to low-budget, surfer kids & low-budget families. There was no restaurant in the hotel. Unless you are guaranteed oceanview on the 3rd floor or higher, you will not really like the view. On one side of the hotel is a 15-storey apartment blocking natural light & your view. On the other side of the hotel is the beach PUBLIC WASHROOM building, a parking lot & the pier (better than the north side anyway). The ladies serving the continental breakfast are grumpy, especially if you get there 10 minutes before closing. The breakfast area is messy, everyone helps themselves & leaves a mess. Too much bird poop on the patio tables & chairs. And the pool --- what a joke! Way too small for all the kids using it. And it is surrounded by glass walls to keep the plentiful beach bums out of the property. Having said that, the staff did try to move us to a better room, altho' it was not enough given our other issues with the surrounding environment. This is not a beach resort hotel. It's a nice condo where u need to go out & get your own supplies & drive everywhere (eg. to good restaurants in La Jolla/ Coronado Island).

This was our first time in San Diego and we happened to arrive at the same time the area was in the middle of an atypical cold snap. We originally reserved and were placed in a partial ocean view junior suite on the top (3rd) floor. This view was great for both looking out with a direct view of the boardwalk to the south and the ocean at just a slight right angle. We also faced the pier which extends hundreds of feet over the ocean and was lighted at night. The room was spacious and well appointed and includes a small kitchenette area, sitting area with couch and a small desk area for laptop use. Free Wi-Fi and parking was included in our package. The stocked kitchenette is convenient for those that may want to purchase food and prepare some meals to reduce restaurant dining expenses should you desire to do so. It\u2019s a nice option but we did not take advantage of that aspect.. Visit Kono's a few blocks walk south on the boardwalk for a big breakfast at reasonable prices. Do take advantage of the very knowledgeable and helpful staff of the hotel. Both Angela the concierge, and Kyla at the front desk are fantastic to work with and exceptional at their jobs. Upon arrival we spent a fair amount of time with Angela getting assistance and recommendations for the \u201cmust-do things\u201d in the area that she would recommend as a person with provincial knowledge. Angela took time with us to provide us helpful information, directions, restaurant recommendations and even ways to save money by acquiring discounted event/tour coupons available at that time of our stay. During the remainder of our stay whenever we saw each other we would casually chat about what we have done and are planning to do next, as easily as if talking with a friend. The next point I cover is not a complaint. It's an example of how the hotel staff works to please their customers. Although the assigned room was almost perfect in every way, there was a slight issue with our shower. No matter how we positioned the shower head, water still leaked out onto the floor. The swinging glass doors have a slight open space where they meet the side walls, and the joint where the glass doors are suppose to seal must not be tight enough. This was not so much of an issue other than it required us to use the towels to sop up the spillage which took more than just one towel to absorb. I was more concerned about long term damage to bathroom floor and to the ceiling of the room directly below us than any minor inconvenience to us. After our second morning when we were leaving to sightsee for the day, I reported my concerns about the shower to Kyla at the front desk. She said she would send someone right up to look at it. Out of curiosity, I inquired if there were any full ocean view rooms available for upgrade. Kyla checked for availability and found a corner room with a full ocean view that was displaying as available for the next 2 out of our remaining 3 nights and she offered it to us at a VERY reasonable upgrade fee. She could then move us our final night to another full ocean view junior suite room free of any additional charge. All we had to do was throw our clothes back into our suitcases and the staff would move them while we were out for the day. Anything hung in the closets could stay there and the staff would take care of moving them. During the 15 minutes it took for us to go back to pack our bags and return to the front desk with the old room keys, Kyla informed us of some good news. She was able to move some things around in the system so we could stay in the corner room for the duration of our stay. Not only were we excited to hear this news but Kyla looked genuinely excited for us that she was able to work this out while we had packed. She really went above and beyond anything we had expected and I can\u2019t stress enough how she sincerely took pleasure in making us happy. The room was a great bargain in my eyes. This corner room turned out to be one of the large honeymoon suites with two separate balconies overlooking both pool and ocean, two separate rooms dividing the living room, kitchen, dining room area from the bedroom, bathroom area (with larger sink area and separate large Jacuzzi). We awoke each day looking directly from our bed straight out to the ocean, with the waves lapping onto the shore and no more water lapping onto the bathroom floor after showering. The hotel has a nice pool area but as mentioned the weather was a little cool and windy. You need your room key to gain entrance though the gated areas. This is probably due to keep small children and non-guests from access. The pool was heated and the children had no problems jumping right in. There is also a large separate hot tub to one side of the pool with temperatures high enough to ward off any cold weather. We found this hotel\u2019s location ideal for our plans which included spending our time at different places in the surrounding area. During our stay we visited the typical spots such as Old Town, Coronado Island, Balboa Park, Gaslamp quarters, Seaport Village, etc., via the Old Town trolley tours (highly recommended for first time visitors). We drove the rental car back to some of the same to spend time in the evening hours. We also briefly visited La Jolla, Laguna Beach, Balboa Island and Newport Beach. The hotel\u2019s location was perfect for both these North and South directional excursions. All the staff at the Pacific Terrace hotel should be commended for their customer service and friendliness from the bellboys, valet parking, maid service, front desk and concierge. Each person always had a ready smile and courteous greeting during the length of our stay. We would highly recommend this hotel to be one of the top on your list for consideration if you are staying in the area.

We book the full ocean view room as we enjoy sitting on the balcony with a glass of wine watching and listening to the ocean waves. If you like to leave the balcony access door open (to hear the waves at night) be advised that at 7:00 AM the pool area is open and it becomes a bit noisy. This is a family friendly hotel and there are kids along with the noise they create.

I wish breakfast was included in the room cost, but at least complimentary coffee and tea was available to all guests in the breakfast restaurant. I have no complaints other than the fact that the room keys were very hard to get to work. Especially on the outside doors heading out to the board walk.

I must say, though, that the surrounding area, surprisingly, seems a bit \"downmarket\". Our view looked out,. partially, on a public washroom that was refuge (in bad weather) for at least four unfortunate, homeless individuals. In good weather, they spent nights on the wooden walkway to the beach. While I sympathize with their plight - it set up a strange combination of resort versus homeless neighbors. Just what were we trying to accomplish - relaxation? or dealing with reality? In looking back on Trip Advisor comments (on return home), I noted that this situation was pointed out a couple of times back in 2009 - so its been going on for a while. So, it seems, it is a long-term issue there. I suppose the kicker for me was the nightly, late-night \"singing\" by our \"neighbors on the beach deck\". My young son joined us in bed having \"nightmares\". He said they were singing \"help me\". What do you say to that ? Other sounds along the walkway late at night were heard most nights.. So..... what should I say.? I'm not overly negative, just realistic.

We are not in the $380/night hotel crowd but this was worth it for the once-in-a-lifetime experience of hearing and seeing the surf outside our open balcony. The Capri condos next door is a much taller building and has huge search lights on its roof. It lights the white waves of the surf during the night so after dark, you can still see the waves rolling in. It was pretty incredible to fall asleep to the sounds and sights of the ocean. The room was sumptuous and we enjoyed it very much. This hotel is one of those places where you don't ever really see work being done but you know there must be many workers to keep it all so perfect all the time. This was our first exposure to extra fees for everything. Our \"extras\" bill was over $200, above our pre-paid room/taxes. That was just parking, internet and breakfasts, not even the mini bar or room service. Breakfast was posted as $9 but it had 2 kinds of fees/taxes added to that which made it $13. I'm sure those things don't matter to the money-is-no-object crowd. This location is second to none. The boardwalk is about 5 yards past the edge of our pool/breakfast area, and then the sand and water are just below that. We soaked up the ambiance of rollerbladers, yoga'ists, surfers and California culture. Things I found odd about our room: the shower had beautiful luxury glass doors, but were placed on a standard hotel tub, which meant you had to shower with your arms up to not bump into the (marble) walls or glass doors. It was very very clean, but I still think it's gross to rub against a shower wall.The water pressure was also nothing great. The bed frames were outrageously beautiful handcarved wood. The wierd part was that the rim part of the frame running around the mattresses was about 8 inches wide. Just swinging my legs down off the tall bed without thinking about it resulted in a number of good bruises. This was a bed where you had to calculate your strategy for reaching the floor. And they don't have any King beds, just queens. I'm sure this is every hotel's battle near salt water, but there were several bits where the drywall was crumbling or rusting metal showed through.

San Diego is a great vacation spot and this hotel reminds you constantly where you are and how lucky you are to be there.

The location is outstanding, right on the boardwalk a 30 second walk to the beach. There is no restaurant on site which was a little more effort for those travelling with very small children/infants etc. They do offer a wonderful in house hot breakfast for $9 a person which was very very good. In addition we were told there was some arrangement for room service but mainly we strolled around the area to find a good place (ie the Thai place right around the corner is GREAT) Rooms were very clean and the beds super comfortable. Pool and hot tub were good temp (ie warm) and appeared well taken care of. Parking is $20 a night with free Valet, I know this may seem reasonable but after paying for the room being charged 20 bucks a day on top to park just seems like one of those annoying \"extra costs\" The garage was never more than half full so I would suggest just allow one vehicle per room per night. We stayed in the family suite and my only suggestion was that this doesnt work well as a \"family\" suite. It is on the main floor and it is a two room suite. The bedroom has 2 queens the washroom and the patio. The living room has a sofa and TV. If you have small children and put them to bed early you cant use the patio or bathroom without waking them up going in and out. Your only choice is to stay in the small living room with no access to the outside patio.We like to hotel/resorts where we can out our child to bed and have access to the deck/patio to have a drink on. Even my wife though it was a weird setup . I dont think for us it set up well as a family suite but rather it is more of an executive suite but yet it still has 2 queen size beds instead of one king. If it were possible the deck/pation should be made avaialble from the living room area. All in all a very good hotel, we would return as a couple but not with our little one just because of the setup.", "Date": "February 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oro Valley, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cThis was an excellent holiday getaway!\u201d", "Author": "adsouthall", "ReviewID": "UR95112262", "Content": "This hotel was the perfect choice for relaxing after a long day of sightseeing!

The service was extremely friendly and accomodating, from the front desk, to the maid service (we needed extra laundry bags), to the breakfast room crew...all treated us like family in their own home!

The top reasons why: 1. Best sleep I've ever had in any hotel, ever. Beds/bedding are extremely comfortable, but leaving the balcony door open and falling asleep to the sound of waves is incredible. Sometimes when I'm having trouble sleeping at home I literally imagine I'm at the Pacific Terrace. Sounds cheesy, but it's true. 2. Best balconies and views. Pay the extra money for a Full Ocean View room, and request the 3rd floor. I mean it. On our last trip we booked last minute on a holiday, so we had to take a first floor Partial View. I had to keep pretending I'd never been there before so I wouldn't keep feeling sad about what we were missing. The rooms are still lovely, the landscaping is still beautiful, and we could still hear the ocean, but there's simply no comparison. 3. Wonderful rooms. The carved wood furniture, pretty ceiling fans, and floor to ceiling plantation-style shuttered doors make me feel happy every time I walk in the door. Most hotel rooms, even suites, usually make me feel claustrophobic and uncomfortable. These rooms make me never want to leave. Of course, I spend most of my time on the balcony watching the surfers. 4. Great pool for the kids, great lounge area for me. The kids like to swim for hours, and it can be a dreaded chore for me when a hotel pool doesn't have a pleasant lounge area. I could sit by this pool all day and be perfectly happy. The pool is not too big, not too deep, and 3 feet from the boardwalk so you can watch the kids, people going by, and sunsets on the ocean all at the same time. The full-length glass walls help keep out the wind (and wandering people) without losing the view. At night they light torches all around and light up the numerous palm trees with Christmas lights. It's awesome. 5. Just a few steps to the the beach. The stairs from the boardwalk to the beach are about 20 feet from the hotel. You can go from your room to the sand in 60 seconds, and jump right in the hot tub when you get back. There is an extremely helpful warm water shower station by the pool to wash away all the sand. All this accessibility to the beach, and yet we still feel very safe with every gate requiring room keys for entrance. These are just the main reasons why we love this hotel. There are also nice things like friendly service, good breakfast, great restaurants, fun bars, beautiful weather, clean rooms, awesome housekeeping, plenty of big towels, comfy robes, complimentary beach toys and boogie boards, and particularly delicious cookies every afternoon. It can be a little expensive during the peak season, but it's still worth it. So often, with hotels in this price range, you feel like you've paid a lot of money for a fancy lobby and a room that's no better than an $100 Marriott. We compare every other hotel we stay in with the Pacific Terrace, and haven't found one yet that we like better. This is why we keep coming back year after year.", "Date": "January 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Grand Island, Nebraska", "Title": "\u201cIf a great hotel with ocean views is what you're looking for - this is it.\u201d", "Author": "Bridesmom_8", "ReviewID": "UR92706141", "Content": "We're from Nebraska and rarely get to be on either coast so when we planned to go to San Diego the first thing I looked for was a great hotel on the Pacific Ocean.

For those who like having an on-site restaurant this would not be the fit for you; however they do offer breakfast each morning in a downstairs lounge area at a reasonable price.

After a quick check-in we headed to our room. It's a smaller hotel than we've stayed in before, but it had a nice \"private\" feeling to it, perhaps due to the size and more upscale decor. We had a perfect view of the pool area and the ocean from our top floor, centre room suite. It was incredible falling asleep and waking up to the gentle sound of the Pacific Ocean right outside our large balcony window. In fact, the way the room and bed are positioned, we could actually watch the ocean as we lie in bed. It was far enough into the room, however, that there was no worry of anyone outside looking in. The spa tub in suite was huge and extremely comfortable, easily fitting my 6'2\" husband and my 5'2\" self with room to spare. The toiletries were nice and they provided toothbrushes and toothpaste in addition to the usual upscale soaps, hair products and lotions. Our toilet did stop working after one use, but after a quick call to the front desk, an \"Engineer\" came and fixed it within minutes. We were very impressed.

The room was incredibly spacious with 2 very comfortable queen beds, huge flat screen tv, dvd player, sound system, sofa, dining table and small kitchen area with a mini bar and fridge. We even commented that the suite was probably bigger than our small townhouse at home. There was also a spacious private balcony with a partial view of the ocean which was close enough to hear the waves crashing and watch the surfers. I highly recommend the 3rd floor rooms for best view and least street noise. The bathroom was beyond belief with a HUGE jacuzzi tub, walk-in shower, spacious closet, dressing and makeup area AND a TV!!! Watch a movie from the tub or while you're getting ready. An array of toiletries were provided including shampoo, conditioner, lotion, bath salts, shower gel, mouth wash, toothpaste and tooth brushes. The maid service was amazing; they respected our privacy and as soon as we left just for a short time, we came back to a made up room without ever seeing the staff responsible. The front desk and all other staff were all very helpful and accommodating. The heated pool and jacuzzi were very nice and the hotel location cannot be beat. It's just off the ocean and a very short walk to many restaurants, bars, nightlife, and shopping.

There must just be something \"magical\" about Pacific Terrace. In our times, with everyones busy lives, for all of these happy guests to sit down and take the time to write multiple paragraphs praising this hotel must say something great about this jewel of a hotel. We are rate shoppers! Never once in negotiating our room rates, comparing with other hotels, etc., did the staff ever make us feel \"cheap\" or badly for trying to get the most room for the money- quite the opposite in fact. Paul, Danielle and Carli were all wonderful to deal with as we changed rooms (different views and sizes) three times before deciding on one! When we arrrived at 7:00 am (after a 6 hour drive from Phoenix) they took our number and promised to get the room ready early for us...they also recommended a restaurant up the street called Hennesseys. The concierge Katherine overheard us looking for a place to eat breakfast, called the restaurant and arranged for us to get a two for one breakfast:) Hennesseys also is a wonderful, casual place to eat- equally friendly and accomodating staff... low key though, so if you are looking for \"fancy\" this is not your place! Great food, great drinks- and a very lively football watching group was their clientele! So, true to their word, we got our room early... having booked a full ocean view and coming out to see palm trees blocking our view- we asked to switch rooms.... again- NO PROBLEM:) They rushed a bellman up to us- he helped us pack up the room we had just unpacked and they moved us down the hall- the whole time assuring us that the room we had was the only one with the palm tree \"blockage\" and not to feel badly about wanting to switch. We did this and got the most AMAZING view!!! After a long day of sun, drinking and eating, we decided to rent a movie on the PPV they offer at the hotel- being technologically challenged, we had to call down a few times to figure out how to get it to work- again- no problem... every request, small or large was met with a smile, and NO PROBLEM- that should be the theme for this hotel- WE HAVE NEVER HAD SUCH AMAZING SERVICE AS IN THIS HOTEL! We have stayed in resorts in many cities- many of them more expensive and \"high end\" with less amenities, and certainly worse service. Its as though the entire staff goes to customer service seminars on a nightly basis to keep it so consistent:) One last thing we would like to point out, and yes we are going to mildy bash a couple of the other beachfront hotels here- Ocean Park Inn, Tower 23, Beach Cottages, Best Western Blue Sea Lodge..... We have stayed at these places. We have occasionally made reserverations and then called the cancel them... well, before staying this time at Pacific Terrace, we had also booked a room for $30 less at Ocean Park Inn. When we booked the room at Ocean Park I called Pacific Terrace to cancel- they didnt just say \"ok, heres your cancellation number\"- they asked why? And they asked if there was anything they could do so we didnt have to break the reservation....it worked! Even though Pac Terrace was higher by $30 a night, we stayed with them- number 1- because they made us feel that our visit mattered- number 2- they offered us a nice bottle of wine! So, I then called Ocean Park Inn to cancel and got \"heres your cancellation number\"- not even a why.... that kind of service with our kind of take on it could mean thousands of extra dollars a month for one hotel over the other! Our special thank yous to Katherine, Paul, Kyla, Carli, Danielle, Angela, Ted and the bellman- sorry guys we do not remember your names! Even the housekeeping staff who were always smiling and friendly- who also left animal shaped towels on our bed!! Little things are everything at this hotel!!!

The room sizes are very good and if you have selected a room with two \"queen size\" beds, these are a genuine equivalent to a UK double bed size. Service is very professional and efficient but not in your face. Whilst staff are obviously looking to maximise their tips, they would never be so rude as to mention or suggest it. Facilities are a little limited (fitness room is small and no restaurant), but you have a plethora of eating and drinking establishments nearby. The \"boardwalk\" at Pacific beach is lively during the day, but not noisy at evening. There are one or two homeless around, but the area is very safe for walking around even late at night. It doesn't really have a spa, but the treatments/massages are as good as any we have encountered in many luxury spas in the UK and elsewhere. The place has personality rather than corporate blandness. It is not 5 star as it doesn't have the full facilities you would expect in a 5 star, but the quality of the hotel and the friendliness of service put many of these to shame.

Ignore reviews from 2005. All rooms have been updated. Our family of six planned a last minute (10days in advance) trip to San Diego. Our late plans ruled out renting a house on the beach--the next best thing was the Pacific Terrace (and about $5000 less than a house for six nights). We have traveled the Caribbean extensively, and the service was as great here as anywhere we have been! Nice, clean comfortable rooms. Because of alittle booking glitch (ours not theirs!) we did end up switching rooms, and saw four rooms in the hotel. I don't think there is a lousy view in the place! They all are \"partial\" which practically means \"full\" ocean views. The only rooms I spotted that could be questionable were the ones on the first floor facing north towards the parking ramp exit. Very clean, great beds, and very accomodating front desk. Purchased tickets at concierge for Zoo at a discount. Great restaurant within walking distance down Boardwalk (which is really concrete sidewalk) called JRDNS. Fantastic breakfast or lunch. Ate there twice. Did not eat there for dinner. Great little mom and pop owned breakfast place 2 blks called Sweet & Savory Cafe at 4600 Mission Blvd. Unbelievable stuff!! Great breakfast wraps etc. Only takes about 20 min to get downtown San Diego (in light traffic). Have to admit; the amount of homeless peeps in the San Diego area is a downer--but in this economy I'm sure that is up in all temperate climates. Drive down along the harbor in late afternoon. Great photo opportunities.

The view of the surfers riding the waves is great, from your balcony or from the pool area. Plenty of restaurants and shops within an easy walk. Drive north a few miles to La Jolla to see the seals or snorkel with the leopard sharks, or just take in the gorgeous scenery. Only 10-15 minutes from downtown, the zoo and the aiport. The hotel: The rooms have an elegant touch to them, yet are very comfortable. The beds were great, the bathroom had plenty of space (separate vanity area), and there is a large hi-def TV. The balconies were roomy enough for the four of us to have our pizza while taking in the view. The pool is not huge, but it's fine because the hotel is small. Everything is lit up at night, giving it a very warm, romantic feel even with the kids there. Amenities: Large towels are provided in your room when you arrive to use at the pool and/or beach. They are yours for the duration, but they are happy to provide fresh ones. There is free lemonade, iced tea and water in the Caribbean room by the pool, and cookies during happy hour. Boogie boards were provided for the kids at no charge. The continental breakfast included in the rate was more than adequate with bagels, danishes, muffins, fruit, juice and coffee. Parking is $20, but it includes valet service. There are also computers with free internet access and printers for guest use. Service: The staff is what really pushes this hotel over the top. Everyone had a smile and a hello, and seemed eager to please. Check-in was a breeze, and the front desk was happy to provide info on food, shops, etc. Our room was made up each day while we were out, and the kids loved the chocolates with the turn-down service. The staff members were happy to take photos for us, and Danny the bellman was even able to give us some pointers on using our camera. Overall: Unbeatable, even though it is expensive. You often feel that four and five-star hotels try to nickel-and-dime you with extra charges, but the Pacific Terrace is just the opposite.

The location - gorgeous, funky, convenient, safe, walking distance to lots of things, and best of all...not downtown. The roar of the surf is part of the appeal, as well as the view and people watching. The hotel feels small and intimate - you recognize when there are new people at breakfast in the morning. We would get up before our kids, sneak out of the room and go have coffee and read the paper poolside while they slept - glorious. The hotel has quite an international feel of the clientele, and there are plenty of kids around. Another amazing thing - and even our kids kept commenting on it - was how nice everyone is. From the housekeeping staff that would run things to our room to the engineer that was fixing the pool heater at 10:00 at night and proudly said it would be ready for us in the morning, the staff was simply outstanding. And finally, I have one tip and a final compliment for the staff. We knew that we were going to go to the Wild Animal Park, Zoo and Sea World while we were there, but decided not to buy the 3-1 pass online because the hotel web site said they sold discounted tickets. As it turns out, they are unable to offer the same discount that you can get online due to restrictions from Sea World, so it ended up costing us more to buy at the hotel. It was MY mistake, as I didn't ask ahead of time where to purchase them. However, the hotel CREDITED ME the difference between what I would have paid online and what they can charge! I'm not kidding - these people are the best. So, buy your tickets online, but stay at the Pacific Terrace when you visit.

They were almost too generous with the towels and bath products! The resort is on the north end of a 3 1/2 mile boardwalk: if you get up before the crowds it's an awesome run. Definitely rent bicycles and pedal down to Mission Bay and through the lovely park. The boardwalk is mighty busy, but the hotel is a little off of where the action is so you wouldn't even realize how crazy busy Pacific Beach actually is while staying at the hotel: but just walk out the door and south one block and you're in the middle of it all! We enjoyed watching the surfers at all hours of the day from our balcony, and pool area was tropical and lovely. The concierge took care of every possible question and request we had. My husband and I felt perfectly comfortable on our own at the hotel, but it was filled with families who seemed to be having a great time as well. I didn't feel overrun by all the kids there, and our visit was still quite romantic. My only suggestion is try not to rent a room on the south side of the hotel - the balconies overlook the parking garage and a street that seemed very busy with early morning surfers: you might find that action disturbing.

It was nice and had the weather had been better Im sure we would have enjoyed it more but we felt overall it was just ok. Notes of caution... There are very limited facilities in terms of food and drink on the premises. There is no bar, no snacks and the breakfast area is badly designed and not able to cope with the volume of people. Food is available to order but comes from a local restaurant and is therefore expensive and takes a while. Pool are is ok but quite small. On the plus side the rooms are clean and well maintained - although furniture is a bit weird! The staff however were excellent and couldnt do enough for you.

Was told my room would be a \u201cJr. Suite\u201d with two beds and a sofa sleeper, w/best view available. The hotel employee encouraged me to upgrade to this suite, over a standard 2 queen, to make our stay here more enjoyable, with the extra space & bed. It had an extra cost of $75 but after speaking w/him agreed to additional charge. We were very excited, as we had not stayed at this hotel in the past 5 years, but before this time had stayed many times and had been very pleased. Upon arrival we were given the \u201cJr. Suite\u201d which seemed to be a standard room with 2 queen beds. I went to the front desk, and asked about the sofa sleeper, and explained this was the reason I had upgraded to the \u201cSuite\u201d over the standard queen. They told me there must have been some mistake. They offered a larger suite, which had a sofa sleeper, with no view to compensate. I told them the reason for our stay was for the view. They then stated they had a comfortable \u201cAero\u201d bed which had an additional $20 charge, which they were willing to comp for the misunderstanding. We received the bed, which was a little twin blow up mattress, which rested directly on the floor. After we had settled into our room, we began to hear hammering and pounding from the room below our room. We called the front desk to ask about this. They informed us the room below us was under construction, and was being re-carpeted. We asked how long the pounding would continue and we were informed it would be another hour. The hammering and pounding continued all afternoon. We had to leave the room because the noise was so loud. When we returned to the room, and went to sleep, the blow up bed I was sleeping on had a hole in it, and I slept the entire night on the floor. In the morning, we went to get a towel from the pool area to take to the beach. The security guard yelled at us, and treated us like we were criminals-he wanted to know how we got into the pool area. I explained I had used my key. The guy seriously needs to learn some customer service skills. I went to the front desk, and spoke to the same lady I had been speaking to all along, blonde with glasses. She had a great big smile, and tried to pacify me with it. She wanted to make things \u201cright\u201d for all of our hassle. She told me that we could stay another night at no charge. I asked her which room we would be able to stay in. She told me we could not stay in our same room, because it was booked. She had someone show me a room they could offer us. The room was a large room, w/NO VIEW... the view was of a hotel next to ours. Upon returning to the front desk, we told her it would not work for what we had paid to stay, she said there was another room with an excellent view that might be available, and that we should go and do our daily activities, and then she would call us when she knew if it would be available. After waiting 1 hr, we had not heard back, so we went to have breakfast\u2026. Again HUGE disappointment\u2026 it is not what it used to be. We returned to the front desk, and asked her what were the plans. She still did not know. By this time, it is 10:30am, and we need to know if we need to pack up our stuff and check out, or move to another room. We asked to see the room, but she refused to show it to us. We told her we could not make a decision, until we were able to see what kind of a room they were willing to offer. She said she was not able to show it to us, but encouraged us to just \"take the offer\". We then went to the 2nd floor, where the room was that they were offering, and saw the door open, and asked the maintenance staff who were working on the room if we could take a peek. There was no view, except for a view of the parking lot and public beach bathrooms. Once we saw the view, we understood why she refused to show us the room. We then called the front desk, and told them we would be checking out, and we wanted a discount on our room for all of the issues we had experienced. Upon checkout she had a smile on her face, but her body language showed our issues were a serious inconvenience for her.", "Date": "May 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cNEVER SORRY I STAYED HERE\u201d", "Author": "Pickeetravelor", "ReviewID": "UR63535891", "Content": "In a time when customer service is poor, this place goes out of there way to make sure you are happy.

If you don't want to have to get dressed up, and you want to walk to any number of casual seafood restaurants for dinner, this is the spot for you. THe hotel is right on the boardwalk, but about two blocks down from the more commercial area, so you avoid the noise and chaos. You access the beach by going down a staircase. We could watch the surfers from our balcony window. The view is amazing. The pool is small, but managed somehow, even during spring break with lots of families there, to have seats for everyone each time we went. The pool has a glass wall separating it from the boardwalk, which allows a great view, but protects from the wind. Our room, a suite, was very large and comfortable.

Sure, it is great to be at the beach -- especially when you normally live in a cold, damp or otherwise unattractive climate. Pacific Terrace is in a great location for watching the Pacific, the surfers, the skaters, and also some highly transient people who frequent this area. The staff are young but try to be very helpful and many of them will go out of the way to assist. But they do not have the experience to provide superior attention to details that many reviewers have come to expect. Their intentions are the best but in my observation the hotel management seems to be absentee. When the rooms were redecorated 4-5 years ago they brought in horrible beds that have huge wooden frames. They were supposed to be luxurious -- but fail miserably. The beds are high and the wooden frames are very large and uncomfortable when one gets into and out of the bed. They probably cost the hotel a fortune (or maybe not-- perhaps the manufacturer realized their design flaws) but they seem as if they will be around for a while although they look dated now. (Management has even added a small set of steps to use to get into the bed--like the ones you see on TV for your dog) Large flat screen TV is supposed to compensate for the bed issues I imagine... (don't forget your remote) Over the years I have found that the rooms are VERY variable in cleanliness, view, comfort and amenities. If you don't like the first room you are assigned, ask for another. Unless you want to keep tabs on children and the pool, I strongly advice a second or third floor for the view and the improved security (although the property is secure-- the open door to a private balcony is better than a room where people parade by and can look in..) They need to go to a better system for breakfast-- The management should simply find a way to include it. I am sure I'll be back but would rather stay on the harbor.

It's a smaller three story hotel overlooking Pacific Beach, separated from the beach by the popular 3 1/2 mile boardwalk. Our room was nice, decorated in a Caribbean/tropical theme. Nice limestone bathroom, separate sink area with a mini fridge. Everyone working there is super friendly and helpful. Complimentary continental breakfast included lots of choices: cereals, fruit, yogurt, bagels, pastries, coffee, juice. At breakfast you can also pay for a cooked meal, but lunch and dinner are not offered, nor is there a bar in the hotel. (Complimentary glass of wine delivered to your room on your first night, and of course, lots of watering holes nearby.) I think all the rooms have at least a partial ocean view, which is how our room (208) was listed, but I really couldn't have asked for more \"view.\" Our balcony was good sized, overlooking the ocean and the courtyard where the pool and hot tub are. Didn't make it for a workout in the fitness center which is a small room in the parking garage, but got plenty of exercise on the boardwalk and in the pool. The location is great, couldn't be closer to the water, and right on the city bus line. Lots of restaurants and a grocery store within walking distance. Loved Pizza Amore for salad and thin crust New York style pizza. Would not return to the Green Flash restaurant, and the restaurant JRDN (yes, that's spelled correctly) was too hip for us---think \"ultra lounge\" but the food was good (and pricey). I would definitely return, but probably only in winter. If you're a people-watcher you'll love the 24/7 walker-jogger-bike-rollerblade-segway-skateboard-dog-stroller traffic (got the picture?) on the boardwalk, but if you like your privacy you might find the constant parade a little intrusive. Even though the courtyard and pool area are walled and gated, a large part of the wall is glass so that you can see the ocean, but the boardwalk users can look into the courtyard and even into your room if you haven't closed your shutters. In January even during bad weather, the boardwalk was used pretty heavily and I'm sure it's crazy crowded in summer.

If you view the video tour and click the master suite you can see how nice it is. I slept on the pull-out sofa bed- it has an inflatable mattress and they include an electric pump that's easy and fast to use. Let me tell you- it was soooo comfortable! As you can see in the video tour, there are two spacious balconies overlooking the ocean. You can really enjoy the relaxing sounds of the waves as you drift off to sleep. That's what's wrong with some of the mega resorts- your too far away from the beach that you can barely see or hear anything.

Went to use a robe and untied it only to find a long black hair inside the robe. This robe was not tied as neatly as the other one so I suspect housekeeping replaced a \"used\" robe on the hook.

This room was the largest suite they had but we were told we could only stay for 1 night because it was booked the next day.

My husband used the jacuzzi tub and the drain plug wouldn't come up so we had to pry it open with a knife. This huge and expensive room did not have a closet! There was 1 armoir with a rod but it was about 10 inches too short so our slacks and dresses. crumpled at the bottom.

The hotel does not have an actual restaurant on the premises, but they have arranged room service with several of the local restaurants.

We chose this hotel based on Tripadvisor reviews and its proximity to the ocean. The hotel is wonderful.

Pros -Hotel is super clean, very nice overall -Rooms are awesome and decorated with real furniture not the normal cheap hotel stuff! -Nice pool with great bar service from very helpful staff -The view of the ocean is awesome. We had an Oceanfront King on the 2nd floor. I would try to get one of the end rooms that face the ocean when I return. All have awesome views but the hotel is sort of C shaped facing the ocean. The end rooms have the awesome view but don't have to overlook the pool. Either way, the view is awesome and will not disappoint. -Location is within walking distance to all sorts of original restaurants. Ask the front desk, they will guide you. Make sure you eat at Taco Surf, just 1 block away on the main road. Its a wonderful little dive Mexican restaurant. Very clean and delicious. The kids (ages 3 & 5) liked the pizza next door and I was able to bring it in to Taco Surf. Cons - these are nit picky but you cannot review all positives! -A little pricey. I booked on their website and chose the Internet prepay deal. The price ended up going down a bit, so I called and was upgraded. But, I would say the price is justified given the service, location, and cleanliness of this hotel. -Self parking is $20 per day. With the price of the rooms, this should be included. Good luck parking the car if you refuse to use their parking. -I called to ask if they were on the beach. I was told they are 15 steps from the beach. Not true, they are 15 feet from the beach, but if you took 15 steps towards the beach, you would fall down a 30 foot cliff. Now, however, they are on an awesome boardwalk and located between 2 sets of stairs to get to the beach. The stairs are probably 45 feet in either direction. We explored the area quite a bit, and we believe this is the nicest beachfront hotel in the area. There are so many nice touches, from the furniture, to the turn down service, to the printed information delivered to your room telling you what staff is available overnight even with their pictures, and just the overall great, secure feeling you have while staying here.

We had already booked 4 nights at Loew's Coronado, but wanted to start our trip early and stay somewhere else the night before. I was watching the rates on Expedia and I saw the Pacific Terrace had a \"run of the house\" room for $99!!! The rates for the hotel normally range between $330-$550 during the summer. This was a great deal, so I booked it. I knew that this rate was most likely for a \"non-ocean view\", but I was hoping that we could upgrade when we got there. I called the hotel before we left and they told me that they had quite a few rooms left so I knew that we had a good chance of getting upgraded. When we got there, they offered us a \"full ocean view\" room for only $30 more!!! What a bargain! So we paid $129 for a full ocean view in the middle of the summer. So I would like to give my thanks to the crappy economy for making this possible. As for the room, it was flawless as it was back in 2006. We were on the 3rd floor and the views were incredible. The decor of the room was awesome and you can tell that they spared no expense when this place was built (or refurbished). If I had my choice, I would have brought a pillow out on the balcony and slept there. Hands down, this is one of my favorite hotels in San Diego and one of the top 10 in the country.

While there are some negatives (no restaurant), I can overlook those based on the views, room quality, and friendliness of the staff. By the way, they offer free internet as well!!! I only wish that this place was still an \"unfound gem\" as it was back in 2006 when the rates were low.

We had a so-so rate for the weekend and an ocean view suite. We anticipated the whole pool experience in the car going down from LA. When we got down there we were met by a half dozen youngish thugs with stretched ear lobe rings, full body tats and a few had that glazed look of \"where am I?\" on their faces. There were all guys except one girl who was in a bathing suit that was 3 sizes too small for her body. Not pretty for the family scene. They began to smoke and carry on. It's all good, believe me. I was a punk once too. But not for $400 thanks. The concierge and my wife had a mis communication about dinner reservations but it was finally worked out. We went to the trendy JRDN at the Tower 23 hotel a few blocks away. The babysitter that the hotel arranged was great btw. JRDN started off with a thud. There's lots to write here but I will leave it to Urbanspoon. Look for my review there. Just prepare yourself for lots of trendy but no substance. We inquired about the change in guest profile and were told they would \"ask them to calm down\" if need be. Ya.... no thanks. I don't need to be shot in the garage. These guys were about 5 or 6 to a room btw. I know that was not on the rules list. The free hot breakfast has been changed to a $7.50 hot breakfast with lots of $2.00 add ons. We opted for the free continental. It was fine. The supposed Starbucks coffee was weak. Go down the beach a bit and have a better coffee (and probably breakfast) at Konos. The beach here is not fluffy white but that is ok. If you are looking for Hawaii, San Diego ain't it. But all in all the hotel's location is prime. In fact, if they didn't have the location, they'd probably be out of business at this point. Upon check out the concierge (Katherine?) was very helpful and offered to do anything to make all the woes go away. She gave me free parking ($20) which I didn't ask for. It's funny. They always think it's about the money. It's not. Get rid of the party at the pool and I would have paid $500. The sad part was that she was so earnest in her effort to help, the other \"customer service\" agents at the desk (Matt and another gal) were making fun of her while I was being helped.

They waived the parking fee for us in the garage because we stayed for 11 days. Granted I would have been reimbursed if they charged us anyways. The staff was very accomodating. I wanted a microwave in my room, and they brought one up to me. However the way they plugged it in, I kept killing the power strip it was plugged into. Which didn't help at 4 am when I was getting up. (Jet lag from East Coast) The staff would always recommend a good place to eat for me. both nearby and further away.

Being able to listen to the ocean at night was a plus, expect on the weekends with kids who were there to party checked in, then I couldn't sleep well. The pool was very warm, which helped with the very cool breeze coming off the ocean. Ok now the negatives. I contacted the hotel before my trip to inquire about HSIA. They said it was wireless in the hotel, and there are no wired connections in the rooms. Ok fine, I took a wireless laptop with me.

The grounds are beautiful and well kept up with maintenance people all over collecting towels and any litter that (rarely) seemed to find its way to the pool area. What I loved about the pool is that there was no smoking, no food and beverages (since the eating area patio was just steps away) and no music....Just peace and quiet. Even the very few children in the pool were quiet and well behaved. The tone was just automatically set to be this tranquil. We swam everyday despite SD having a record cold spell during our trip. When I asked the hotel desk to turn up the heat in the pool even more than the 80 degrees it was set at, they immediately complied and the next day, and for the rest of our trip, the pool was a haven away from the cold winds off the Pacific. Each room has a fantastic balcony where we had our breakfast delivered daily. To look at the beautiful ocean and that pristine beach over coffee every morning was the best way to start our day. There is also a walkway along the ocean path for bikes, rollerblades and the like, but we loved walking on this amazing beach best with its hard packed damp sand making it super easy to traverse. The rooms are newly renovated with very comfortable beds, lovely furnishings and lighting, new, clean carpeting, and plenty of space to stretch out. The staff, though, is what made this a special trip for us. We were treated with such cheerful smiles and genuine offers of help in every way by every staff member there. Lynette, Ted, and Cassie were especially helpful. Lynette brought us complimentary wine one evening for us to enjoy on our balcony and even remembered a treat for our 3 year-old son, Leo. The housekeeping staff, too, was exceptional, going out of their was to accommodate our changing needs daily. We loved them all!

We have two children ages 2.5 and 5 years so we stayed in a Family Suite (two rooms) the first two nights. The prices went way up for Valentines Day weekend so we switched to a Junior Suite to be more economical. This room actually worked much better for us and we downgraded the rest of the trip to the Junior Suite from the Family Suite. We found we didn't need the bedroom closed off...the kids fell asleep easily after days at Legoland, Seaworld, Zoo etc. and then coming home and playing in the pool. The suite was well equipted and had a refrig, kitchen table, plates and utensils so we were able to eat fruit and cereal most days before heading out. This saved money and felt like we were having a healthy meal. We loved being pool side so it was easy getting back and forth to the pool with the kids and for cocktail hour supplies. We were thrilled with the location. You are right on Pacific Beach and it is beautiful. The boardwalk runs for 3.5 miles or so and it is just gorgeous. I could not recommend this hotel more. Rooms are very clean. Staff is very friendly and care deeply about your enjoyment and satisfaction. Plush robes are a nice touch and great for traveling out to the pool when the weather is only 60'f but the kids want to go in. Pool and hot tub were great and beautiful view from the pool. We can't wait to go back. Some recommendations...Taco Surf across the street had great authentic Mexican food which we took back to our room for dinner on two nights. Walk down the boardwalk and there is a breakfast place Kono's. Not a healthy breakfast but delicious and people line up. The line moves very quickly. Joe's Crabshack also a nice walk down the boardwalk was delicious and the beers reasonable (3.99 for a microbrewed draft pint). We had the Dungeness crab and it was excellent. Great kids menu which was important to us. Ralph's grocery store was convenient and good prices if you get a store card.

My mother and I sadly only stayed for one night in January 09. We paid $119 on hotels.com and were upgraded to an oceanfront room upon arrival for an additional $50. The room normally is about $250 in the off season. Our room was lovely - 'princess and the pea' beds, very high and cozy. Full mini bar with sink, but also with an empty fridge to stock your own goodies. We were happy that they had actual glassware - coffee mugs, wine glasses, and cocktail glasses. The room was clean and modern with a HUGE television. A nice layout with a more private bathroom / changing area - especially useful with the oceanfront boardwalk right outside your window. The surrounding area included quite a number of restaurant choices - mostly pub / grill type places, which looked casual. We were only there one night and ordered room service, which was fast and yummy. The hotel offers a number of room service options from surrounding restaurants. The only downside is that they charged $20 per day parking fee, but included 'free valet', which was efficient and friendly. I suppose they get away with charging this in the summer months, but in the winter, it seems a bit high - and I'm from Chicago.

The BEST things, of course, are the location and the incredible view and sound of the Pacific Ocean. The facility is fabulous, and the staff bends over backwards to please their guests. They sincerely seemed to want to do whatever they could to make us happy. When we checked in on Sunday, 1/18, the consierge, Katherine, made us feel like we were the most important people in the hotel with her attention to detail, patience, and efficiency in meeting our requests. On the last day of our stay, the front desk gave me enough post cards so that I could give one to each of my students back home. Everything inbetween was exceptional, too. We were fortunate to stay off-season, when the room prices were discounted by 50%. So the price wasn't extremely expensive, just very expensive. Still, we felt that we got our money's worth and then some! We stayed in a 600-square-foot junior suite on the thrid floor with a full ocean view, a King bed, and a breakfast bar. Here are some tips that I don't recall reading in the other reviews: **We discovered that the view was even better when we took the tall breakfast stools out onto the balcony. Then we didn't have to look through the bars to see the ocean. **There is a silent but very effective ceiling fan in the bedroom area that helped to keep the air circulating. The temperature was perfect so we left the patio door open all day long. **The sliding shutter doors can be closed to give you absolute darkness & privacy, or can be moved completely out of the way to provide a totally unobstructed view out the patio door and windows. The shutters can be moved to allow just the amount of light or darkness desired. **Separate from the toilet & shower area, there is a large vanity area by the sink, with a giant mirror and a large plug-in makeup mirror. Lots of room to spread out. **The bed is extremely elevated, probably so you can still see the ocean while you're lying down. There are stairs provided in the closet that can be placed by the bed if you need help getting in and out of the bed! It is unbelievable comfortable, and we slept extremely well. **We slept best with the patio door shut tightly at night. It was very quiet, but you could still faintly hear the beating of the waves. **The $9 breakfast was actually about $27 for two people, when you add in the required gratuity, tax, and a tip for the server delivering it to our room. But it was large, hearty, and very tasty. Great to eat breakfast on the patio as we watched the ocean & the people passing by on the boardwalk! **We observed daily testing and/or cleaning of the pool and hot tub by pool professionals. My husband felt that the chemical balance and temperatures were perfect. **Even during the off season, the $20 per night for parking was well worth it. Easy in, easy out, safe, secure, and convenient. **The best part of the trip was our time at the hotel or on the beach. Why go anywhere else when you're in the perfect location with comfort and luxury all around you? During the day, the ocean, beach, boardwalk, and nearby shops and restaurants were all we needed. Watching the sun go down as we sat on our balcony was breathtaking every evening. After dark, the in-room movies were nice entertainment, for a fee of course. **We purchased pop & snacks at a nearby store to stock our refrigerator so we weren't tempted by the goodies in the mini-bar. In the Carribean Room, coffee & tea were always available, there was iced tea and lemonade in the afternoon, and freshly-baked cookies are at the front desk at 4:00 p.m. Yum! **Twice we ate at the Crab Catcher in La Jolla, about 20 minutes away by car, but you'll need good directions to get there. The hotel concierge can make the reservation and will get you great seating. Delicious food, beautifully presented. See if you can get Michelle to be your waitress -- she was delightful! The worst thing about being at the Pacific Terrace Hotel is when you have to leave. I was actually seriously depressed for about a day after we left! We're already starting to save for our next trip.

The location is nice, right on the beach front, and far enough away from the bars so you don't get too much of the traffic and noise associated with it.

Beds were comfy, and the plasma TV's are a nice touch, especially with the large number of high def channels they had available. It's one of the few times I've actually wanted to stay in my hotel room instead of going out. As another reviewer had mentioned, I was expecting a continental breakfast since I had read somewhere that it was provided. Unfortunately, it's not offered anymore, and breakfast is now a $12 option. Dennys and iHop was close by so I didn't bother with the in house stuff, and just went to one of the many local restaurants nearby for breakfast. The $20 parking was a bit steep too, but with the limited on street parking, you'll probably want to pony up the $20 for it if you're going to be there during peak season. I was there during the winter, and parking was still a little scarce at times. The front desk staff was very friendly and accommodating. They greeted me by name when they saw me which was actually quite surprising and a nice personal touch. They also offered to help with my bags which was also nice.

We stayed in one of the \"Family Suites\" because we wanted a bit of a kitchen available so we didn't always have to feed our little girl restaurant food all the time. Here's what I liked about it: - If you want a \"beach\" holiday in San Diego, the hotel is perfectly located for that; its right there on a very nice one - The local area is great for walking around. Not a lot of high end restaurants, but quite a few mid-range / family friendly ones to choose from, all walking distance - Reasonable drive to Sea World, the Zoo, Old Town, downtown, etc. - Excellent front desk staff; always extremely helpful - Excellent room staff - Prepare to be surprised by how nice the furniture is. - LOVED the two 40\" flat screen hi-def TVs with DVD's. Here's what was not so much: - Bell service... hmm... called for assistance with the inflatable sofa bed. No one ever came. My wife eventually figured it out. - Gave up on the valet parking by the end of the first day. There was NEVER anyone out front when we were coming and going, so we just got used to parking ourselves. - Last day wake up call... asked for 8:00am, got it at 8:18am. How hard is it to get that, of all things, right? Good thing we weren't in a hurry to catch our plane... this alone would make it impossible for me to ever consider staying here on a business trip - Standard collection of all the usual hotel annoyances... cracked wine glasses, sinks that don't drain properly (and the SMELL when they don't...), only tolerably clean carpet, one of the phones didn't work, yada yada yada. - The pool is definitely on the small side, and some days it was a challenge getting a lounger. In the end, while we enjoyed our stay there, we wouldn't go back. Or at least if we did, we wouldn't stay in the family suite, which cost us over $600 per night. At $100 - $200 per night sure, I'll put up with the little stuff, its kind of expected. But for $600 a night the whole experience should be top notch from start to finish, not just parts of it.

Not disappointed, but overall it is pricey for what you get. Pacific Beach area of San Diego is a laid-back and scenic extent of beach that doesn't suffer the pretentiousness of La Jolla, or the city feel of the San Diego centre. This is a small hotel with some great features, including: good breakfast included, great complimentary wines at 4pm daily, twice daily room service with turn-down service, sumptuous bath-robes provided in room, in-room fridge, huge TV, heated pool and plastic wind-barriers round the pool so even when a chill sea-breeze blows, it is hot sitting round the pool. Above all, it is located above a really attractive beach, and there is a great view of the sunset from the beach. However, parking is extra, a rollaway air-bed is extra, and the total cost is similar to a 5 star hotel, which is I think hard to justify. It is a compact hotel, and when busy, it can feel squashed with insufficient space around the pool..Hotel is in a \"V\" shape, with a south and a north wing. The South wing rooms get best views of ocean and sunset, and they get sun on the balcony, the north wing rooms don't, apart from the top floor.

Previous posters complained about the lack of a restaurant and that is a bit annoying. We found that that Pacific Beach is not a center of fine dining so you have to make the best of it. It's a beach community so expect mostly casual dining with many restuarants you can easily walk to. We liked the locations at both the Green Flash and Tower 23. Gringos has good Mexcican food and margaritas though it does not have an ocean view like the others. We loved the boardwalk that passes in front of the hotel.

The free breakfast is so ample that we had little interest in lunch. The wine party at 4 PM is a riot - they serve decent wines, and the servers come by and refill your glass if they catch you not returning to the bar!

When researching hotels in the area, I came across a couple of travel sites with old outdated pictures, when I went directly to the hotels site, I was surprised at how lovely the rooms were. I called the hotel to confirm, that the pictures on their site were current, and I was told that all the rooms have been completely remodeled. I booked a partial view double bed room for 159.00 plus tax (what a bargain) since the price for that class room is normally 440.00 The only downfall was no king bed. I requested for for a room on the 3rd floor, I was told that they couldn't guarantee it, but that he would note that I am requested a room on the 3rd floor. After reading several reviews, I had mixed feelings, but it was really the only beachfront hotel I could find in the 200.00 price range, that looked maintained. The staff was super friendly, attentive and professional. I have never been to a hotel that every class (bellboy, front desk, house keeping, cafe, security) of employee was kind, courteous and willing to bend over backward to accommodate your needs. This hotel is VERY customer service orientated. Upon check in, I asked if they could accommodate us with a king bed, mentioned we were celebrating our anniversary (really tried). Unfortunately they were unable to do so, since they were completely booked. They were able to accommodate my request for the 3rd floor, as the view is so much nicer. Some reviewers complaining about the 20.00 underground parking, but the peace of mind is worth it, very safe, key access only, and direct access from hotel elevator. The room decor was very inviting and up to date. Nice dark solid wood beds, granite counter tops, marble bathroom, huge plasma TV, ipod player clock radio, snack bar, coffee maker, iron, blow dryer, safe. The room was immaculate, and well stocked with towels, comfy bathrobes, bath goods even q-tips & cotton balls. The beds were very comfortable, pillows were fluffy, the sheets were high thread count and super soft. The balcony was spacious, with 4 chairs and a table. Our room was facing South toward the pier, and it was an amazing view. I could have sat on that balcony our whole visit just listening to the waves crash and people watched. There was a little parking lot below our balcony, that was normally occupied by surfers. I had a blast watching the surfers change in and out of wetsuits in the parking lot, lol. It was a little noisy at times (car alarms, beeping delivery trucks, ice cream truck) but I didn't mind, I liked all the action. I do have to say that there were quiet allot of homeless people in this area (most beach areas are this way), but I never felt unsafe or threatened in anyway as they just mind thier own business. Lots of restaurants, clubs and shopping on Garnet which is about a 3 block walk. This area is populated by allot of young college students, majority is 25 and under. There were a few nicer restaurants like Jordan at Tower 23 hotel which is 2-3 hotels down from PTH that had a more mature crowd 30 and over. It's definatley a lively happening area, which my husband and I enjoy. We live in Los Angeles so we are used to this type of atmosphere, it might be a little shocking to people who are not accustomed to this. Beach access is super close and easily accessed through the pool area which is accessed with your room key. We didn't use the pool/spa, but it looked really nice, heated, ton of towels and lounge chairs. I did notice allot of families on the lower level and pool are which is were the family suites are located. Which might be a little odd if you are there for a romantic getaway or honeymoon. Some little perks that make ALL the difference in feeling pampered........... Free iced tea, lemonade, Starbucks coffee (self serve) Basket of apples and fresh baked cookies in the lobby Free wine from 4-5PM in the cafe (self serve) Turn-down service, with Belgium chocolates on your pillow Basket of towels in front of every room in the morning Continental breakfast included I was expecting danishes, cereal and fruit, but the variety was impressive. 5-6 different types of pastries and muffins Bagels, croissants, english muffins (variety of cream cheeses, jams, peanut butter) Fresh fruit, variety of melons, oranges, apples, bananas Variety of hot and cold cereals Boiled eggs Yogurt Starbucks coffee, Tazo teas, Juices, milk The dining area seats about 15, but there are several tables right outside the cafe around the pool or you can get a tray and take your food to your room. If you really want to be pampered, for 12.00 you can put in a request the night before to have breakfast delivered to your room. I myself, got a tray and took it up to my room and enjoyed breakfast on the balcony watching the sun come up. This hotel went above and beyond my expectations, I will definatley be visiting PTH on a regular basis when I need to getaway with my hubby. Hopefully I can get a budget friendly rate again in the future, because $440 is a little steep. The only thing I disliked was the early check out time of 11:00am.

I saw the fabulous ratings on this and other sites and decided to plunge for three nights. When we arrived we found ourselves in the California Wildfire event. We did disney the first two days, but the smoke from the fires did burn our eyes the second day. I was very worried that San Diego was going to be a bigger problem, but my calls to Pacific Terrace were reassuring, so we kept with the plan. I am glad we did. First off, the room was heavenly. Hardwood furniture, big flatscreen tv's in both rooms of the suite, a view of the Pacific, heck we were right on the boardwalk. We were thrilled with the overall hotel and the room. Breakfast was a selection of bakery shop type rolls and danishes and granola with fresh fruit etc. No eggs or waffles, but It was high quality and was probably healthier too. We walked the beach each morning, but the water was too cold for a real swim, but my boy and I did jump in for the thrill. There were great eateries and shops within walking distance which we did use on two nights. Sea world was closed \"due to air quality\" but the hotel which was close by was fine, so I guess it was more due to the fact that nobody would have shown up. The zoo was awesome and more than made up for it. San Diego was such a great city to visit. The Service was superb. Little details abound which let you know that they care about service to the guests. They give real voice calls for morning wake ups, and one morning the guy told me that he recalled that we were heading back to LA for our flight and he informed me that the interstate was closed. If he hadn't done that we would have missed our plane, fortunately they helped me plan a trip through the mountains east of the fires. Driving was a trip, like going through a cauldron of orange smoke when we neared the fire areas.

It's incredibly over-rated and very expensive for what is a 3* motel with a great looking pool and sea view. The rooms are floral-themed circa 1978 and are in drastic need of updating. The wash basin is in the room itself which isn't great. The toilet and shower over the bath (which again is like a motel bathroom) are off the room separately. The \"free\" breakfast is served in pokey, dark room just off the pool - and you have to walk through it to get the pool. Breakfast is cereals, some bagels, bananas, apples and juice so don't get too excited. The pool is nice enough though smoking is allowed and with kids around, not brilliant. There is no pool service for drinks or food. There is some free wine for an hour in the afternoon but no great shakes. There is no restaurant - but there are restaurants locally who will deliver. There is free parking within walking distance of the hotel but it is limited - it's there though. Noise-wise, you can hear other balconies and because the area overlooking the pool is half-moon shaped, can be quite loud, although my 3-year old slept through soundly. For the price, this hotel (motel) is hilariously expensive. It hasn't had much competition in the past, but with hotels like Tower 23 springing up (2 minutes walk from the Pacific Terrace and better in almost every way) I hope they will have to reconsider their proposition. If you think you're going to get a great hotel because of the rate, you won't.

Two years ago I thought that I had found a gem and was nervous to even tell friends as I wanted to keep the secret to myself. My last stay was a week ago and I booked a partial ocean view for two nights. I knew that the rooms are rarely ready before 4pm so did not bother checking in until my conference was over for the day. Upon check in I was shown where my room assignment was and asked if there were any other rooms (I knew this one was not optimal). The gentleman at the desk told me that they were entirely sold out - he assured me that I would like the room. Needless to say, the room was not acceptable. It was directly over the lobby of the hotel and essentially faced the street with a street light shining in to the room and cars parked behind it. When I called and said that this was not what I had expected - he asked in a snippy voice \"can you see the ocean?\" to which I replied \" not really, there is a light glaring into the room\". I told him that I would prefer to check out than stay in this room and then magically there was another room. Both days that I went to the pool there were no towels for the beach or for the pool (only a pile of used towels). In fact, I stood next to a soaking wet man in the lobby the second morning as there were no towels at the pool so he was going back to his room to dry off. The \"breakfast buffett\" is in a small room that feels rather dirty - you can get a tray and bring items to your room which I recommend. The rooms are still nice although do not feel quite as pristine and new as they did 1-1/2 years ago. I agree with the reviewer who stated that if you have a car, you are roped in to the $20 parking fee as there is sparse overnight parking around the hotel.

The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. They sell tickets to area attractions at a small discount, and it was very helpful to have our SeaWorld tickets in advance so we didn't have to wait in lines.

We were celebrating our wedding anniversary after several years of marriage and were looking for something different and romantic as my wife would say. I am an appraiser by profession, so I may be a little more critical in my observations. If you like a noisy beach location then this is your place. The hotel is on the beach boardwalk and lies between two feeder streets that lead to the beach. It has underground parking which is another $20 for each night. Considering the amount of beach traffic you really have no other alternative, but to pay the extra $20 for parking so factor that into your costs. We asked for a partial ocean view to take advantage of the beach location and yet to be a little more economical then the very expensive beach front location, but one had to be on the balcony to see the partial view. What was really annoying is that you were directly facing one of the streets I refer to. If you don't mind being bothered at 6 AM by people arriving at the beach then your OK, but like us, we like the slider or window ajar to get fresh air during the night when sleeping. There is late and early traffic on the streets and since the hotel is only 3 stories high you are going to be relatively close to the noisy streets regardless of which floor you are on. We were on the 2nd floor. One noise that could have been avoided is the hotel Help early in the morning. I didn't understand a word they said, but all I know is that there was one hotel worker that appeared to be in charge of the others and she was doing a lot of yelling to her subordinates in the hallway. The doors were not well insulated and we did complain to the hotel about their Help being too loud in the early mornings. The rooms were appointed rather comfortably, however, the large frame beds did make it more difficult to enter the beds, especially if you have small children or older adults who will find it difficult to climb into and out of the beds. Even exiting the beds we were hitting our shins, because the frames came up so high from the floor. Like many hotels, these beds had colorful tropical bed spreads that I would never sit on or lay on and it is obvious these bed spreads are not washed on a daily basis like the sheets are changed. The floors seemed clean and they did provide new slippers, but the slippers were one size fits all and if you wear an 11 shoe like I do then forget it. The bathroom was OK. Only one sink and the water pressure was normal. The bath tub is enclosed with a double glass doors with seals at the bottom of the doors that did not seal and if you took a shower there was more than just a pool of standing water when you exited. We had to use several towels to soak up the water and we also reported this to the hotel, because we thought it would create mold and moisture problems in the walls. The room had other features, like a small refrigerator, microwave, a small wet bar and a big screen TV. There was a hair dryer, a lighted magnifying mirror and ironing equipment. They did provide terrycloth robes that were available for purchase. One feature they did have that was upscale and that my wife enjoyed was the Gilchrist and Soames body bath soaps and cremes. On the other hand, however, what may be a little embarrassing if you are sharing a room with non-intimate guest is using the bathroom. The bath fan was too small and inadequate to ventilate the bathroom odors that penetrated to the entire room immediately. This is a design flaw in the original construction. There is no restaurant in the building, but they do provide a continental breakfast from 6:30 to 10:00 AM. in the exit room to the pool area. There is also Starbucks coffee provided all day that were in dispensors near the pool area. One evening they did have some complimentary inexpensive wines available for tasting in the late afternoon near the pool/patio area. There is a considerable amount of local shopping stores and small fast food local-owned and chain restaurants , but if you want any real fine dining you will need a vehicle to travel up to La Jolla, which is the adjacent city, which is approximately 5 miles north. Our partial ocean view room was $330 and tax was $41.25, parking $20 for a total of $391.25 per night.

For some strange reason the carpets had been cleaned were VERY wet and a noisy utility fan was running on the floor. To dry it out I guess. The room smelled like a hockey bag.

VERY insincere. Back at the desk the man tells me there aren't any other rooms. So weary were we from travelling and with kids that just wanted to go swimming, we begrudgingly accepted the room (at $400 for that night; our one night in San Diego). That night we tried to sleep...all 3 of us in one bed because the pull out was hard as a rock. We could not open the sliding door to air out the smell of wet dirty socks because we were on the ground floor and were worried about someone breaking into our room in the night. I wrote a letter to the management at about midnight or 1 AM because I couldn't believe how ripped off I felt.

We had booked a oceanfront junior suite. We were offered an upgrade to a master suite for a bit more money. After seeing both rooms, both of which were beautiful, we opted for the master suite because of the separate bedroom which was convenient when our little one went to bed at 8 or 9pm. It was a beautiful room with two oceanfront balconies, 3 flat screen HDTVs (including one above the jacuzzi tub), a small breakfast bar with microwave and fridge and a small dining room table. The attention to detail really made this hotel special. Everything from the bathrobes and slippers to the little stepstool in the washroom so our son could reach the sink to wash his hands and brush his teeth. There were even lovely jars of bath salts left next to the jacuzzi tub which we thoroughly enjoyed. The basket of towels in front of our door in the mornings was a nice surprise. My son loved the little chocolates left on our pillows each night. The rooms were very tastefully done with California shutters instead of the usual nasty hotel drapes. Beds were very very comfortable. My only complaint, and it really is a petty one, is that there was no freezer in the fridge. But it was not a huge deal as the wonderful staff offered to put our frozen foods and ice packs in their hotel freezer for us. Just a minor inconvenience as someone had be sent to fetch our things each day. Again like I said, a petty complaint. The continental breakfast was a nice bonus, and the food was fine - muffins, danishes, bagels and some fruit. We were never around to enjoy the afternoon wine and cookies, but appreciated the ice tea, lemonade and Starbucks coffee available throughout the day. I love boutique style, small and elegant hotels.

It is one of the nicest rooms I've had in a hotel. I don't know what he paid for the room, but he's a great guy. He reserved us one of the King-suite ocean front rooms. It was pretty much in the center of the hotel (kind of shaped like a horseshoe a bit) and I think we had room 316. The balcony was nice sized and felt fairly private even though it overlooked the pool and deck, which is just off the main beach path running throughout PB. We slept with the door wide open at night to the sound of the crashing waves of the ocean. But, it also came with a price. Staff moving deck chairs around in the morning (6 am?) by the pool dragging the metal legs along the concrete as well as a bunch of Marines on their early morning and loud cadence jog. But, did i mention the waves? ;-) The room had gorgeous furniture (a REAL entertainment unit) a huge wide screen LG HD TV, a comfortable bed, enough tables and sitting areas to be comfortable, and lovely decor. The room is decorated throughout with dark wood working such as the crown molding and plantation shutters covering the slider door (no cheesy curtains!). It's very warm, relaxing, and tropical feeling and was reminiscent of a model home in a new housing community. The bathroom consisted of a large wide area near the door with the closet and a nice sink and countertop. One of my few complaints was the screw for the hot water knob was stripped and kept falling off it's base knob. The toliet and tub/shower are in a closed room. The main room had a huge granite counter/bar near the small kitchen area (honor bar, small fridge, microwave). We didn't need any of that (except for the $6 Amstels). Everything was clean, new, and seemed recently painted. My only major complaints are with the towels, they were not that plush or high-end comparing it to the rest of the room's offerings. Robes were provided, though. Also, the pillows on the bed were not that nice (we grabbed two more from the closet). They could use some plusher, down or feather nicer pillows. -The staff are super friendly. -You have to pay for parking in their private garage underneath the building. -We ordered room service which comes from one of two off-site local restaurants (Hennesey's was one).

Too bad they don't have a better restaurant/room service on site. -Location is great, near lots of restaurants, the beach, convenience stores, etc. Though I've never stayed in PB during the high season, it was nice there mid-week in March. Read my other reviews; i'm stingy with the \"5 stars\". I think this place is really 4.5 on my typical scale, but I'll bump it up to 5.

There is also a Dennys for all of you with children who want a family restaurant that is close by. Filippi's Pizza Grotto is disgusting and I would recommend staying away from this place.

I traveled with my husband and 6 year old, we've stayed in plenty of nice and not-so-nice hotels and we were so thankful that we chose the Pacific Terrace. With the numerous online searches available I had originally scoped out a different hotel in SanDiego that we thought would meet our needs, but after reading trip advisor decided that there were too many reviews regarding uncleanliness of rooms and uncomfortable beds, which I will add are my #1 and #2 requirements when choosing a hotel for family travel, (when traveling for relaxation with family it's just not worth it to be uncomfortable). This hotel was very clean, very comfortable (including the beds), and quite peaceful. The friendly staff always greeted us with a smile and a friendly comment when we exited and entered, I think they really like their jobs. One surprise was the exercise room. When hotel staff mentioned that I had to go through the underground parking lot to get to the exercise facility I was haunted by thoughts of a dingy old room with rusty equipment...to my sincere pleasure it was the exact opposite and absolutely perfect. It has new, clean, well maintained equipment, 3 TV's, free weights and machines - it is a small room but has everything you need for a vacation work out, even a scale & restroom with shower. The breakfast (with plenty of healthy choices) and wine reception are a great way to start and end a relaxing day. Don't worry about no shuttle and don't bother with the \"hotel' driver. [I was concerned about whether to rent a car or choose a hotel with the optional shuttles available (hotel shuttle was originally was my # 3 hotel requirement for this family vacation) - but I am happy we chose to rent a car and I recommend it merely because SanDiego is pretty easy to get around and most importantly for the freedom to explore what you want when you want... also renting the booster for our child with the car rental avoided putting him in taxis or vans with inappropriate or no seatbelt. We did the usual SanDiego stuff - the Zoos, SeaWorld, the beach,... but we passionately enjoyed our family vacation when we ventured off the beaten path, for example we visited the beautiful Torrey Pines area and toured a few of the nearby vineyards, which included a fun educational opportunity and often wine tasting's for the adults.] The hotel is surrounded by many types of food and restaurant choices, the room service is a nice option, but we had a great time going for walks (or driving around in our rental car) to explore the area while choosing our next meal. - Konos, Gringos, many Thai, and Japanese options to name a few of our favorites. It was assuring to find that the photos shown on the hotel website are true representations of the rooms and the hotel. Because we vacationed during the off-season we were able to experience this hotel at a reasonable rate, which was much appreciated! In my opinion Pacific Beach area, in general, has a rough-around-the-edges reputation, but what we found is that it's a genuine area with real people - we loved the area and the Pacific Terrace Hotel!! My only fear is that our Pacific Terrace Hotel experience was too good to be true and when we go back we'll discover it was all a dream.

I have to say that this hotel is the cleanest beach hotel I have every stayed in. We had an ocean view room. It was a little smaller than I expected, but the view was absolutely beautiful. The maid service cleans your room twice a day: once in the morning, and once in the evening for turn down service. They do a great job. We brought our two toddlers and they brought their stuffed animals. The kids were so happy when we came back to our room at night to find our bed turned down, and their little stuffed animals propped up on pillows next to chocolates. The entire staff was very nice. I read reviews about them being so young, which is true, they were all young, but they were all very knowledgable, professional and exceptionally helpful. The continental breakfast was very good, and it was great to have fresh Starbucks coffee, tea, lemonade and iced water available all day long. Overall, our experience with this hotel was great. I only have one thing that I would warn about. The preferred driver service for the hotel. First, I want to say that Carlos was a very nice man. He was very insightful about San Diego, and told us about the best places for food and sight seeing. We spoke with the driver before we booked his service. He said he would have a car seat for us, and we do not need to bring one. When he picked us up from the airport, he came early and was in a very clean, beautiful car, but the car seat was only an infant carrier. Needless to say, I couldnt fit either of my children in it, so I had to buckle them in and pray to God that our ride would be short. Carlos does not use turn signals. Nor does he turn his head to check traffic before switching lanes or come to slow stop at traffic lights. We had planned on using him for all of our excursions, but after the ride from the airport, I was too afraid to use him. We didnt reserve a rental because we had everything planned out with the driver service. We called cab services in San Diego, but none had car seats available. We ended up taking a bus to Sea World. On the bus were a couple of local homeless people. We walked everywhere else. It rained all day on Sunday, and we were stuck inside the hotel with nothing to do but watch tv. It is not entirely Carlos' fault. He said that he had a car seat that we could use during our stay if we used his service, but he didnt know how big our kids were. When we asked him if he had a different car seat, he told us that was all he had. My very strong advice is to rent a car with car seats, or bring your own if you plan on traveling with your small children.", "Date": "February 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Ocean Front Hotel\u201d", "Author": "bruiserjohnson", "ReviewID": "UR13046136", "Content": "This was a wonderful hotel in San Diego right on the beach!

I had fallen in love with San Diego on a short trip there in June and just HAD to go back. (So much to do, not enough time to do it.) Our previous visit, my husband, son, and I had stayed at Paradise Point hotel. Enjoyed it, but wanted something right on the ocean this time. (Our suite there was on the water, but the \"water\" was the BAY, and I didn't know that at the time of booking. Still a BEAUTIFUL view of the bay though.) After much research, I chose Pacific Terrace hotel for this trip. As far as I can tell, this is about as close to the beach as you can get in San Diego. (if there are any luxury hotels located directly on the beach, I'd sure love to hear about them) Pacific Terrace is up on a bluff, so do be aware that you have to traverse a rather long flight of stairs from the boardwalk down to the beach. And they seem to be twice as long when you have to climb back up them at the end of the day. That did hamper us a tiny bit as we found ourselves to be quite lazy, but it probably saved us from a worse sunburn than we already got. We spent a lot of time body boarding and just playing in the water. GREAT waves, and very attentive lifeguards. Nice beach with a great view in both directions. A cool pier just to the south and La Jolla to the north. Planes flying overhead with advertisments streaming behind them. Very much the California beach scene. I do have to say though, I liked the Mission Beach area of the boardwalk better than this area, probably because there were no bluffs separating the beach from the boardwalk and all the action. We stayed in a junior suite with a king bed. My son stayed on the sofa (which had a pullout bed he never used) and I had a huge, very comfortable bed all to myself. Loved the room. Beautiful, classy, dark wood furniture, and a very large kitchenette with a breakfast bar. Very clean and comfortable. Our suite was on the ground/pool level. I had asked for a suite as close to beach access as possible, but ended up right in the middle of the hotel with the pool between us and the boardwalk. Turns out, being on the ground floor was not a plus, given the fact that we had to take so many stairs down to the beach anyway, what's a few more inside the hotel? My view of the ocean was minimal so I was a bit disappointed with that. Next time I will request a suite on either the far north or south side of the hotel - still poolside- and probably the top floor so I can see the beach and enjoy ocean more. Good news is, our patio was fairly private, and I could still hear the ocean. I spent a LOT of time out there with my laptop using the wireless internet e-mailing my husband back home. And made friends with the mourning doves who had built a nest nearby. We used the underground parking -very convenient. We fould ourselves driving around to explore every day. The hotel seems to be close to everything and I found San Diego to be a very good city for driving. We walked around the neighborhood a lot, too and felt quite safe. Lots of tourists, a few homeless and wierdos on the boardwalk, but not anything we didn't already expect. Just be aware there are always going to be people targeting tourists in a place like this, so keep your wallet safely tucked in your front pocket, or your purse zipped and always close. I saw one guy that seemed to be scoping us out, probably to pick-pocket. He followed us around for a while, so I finally put my hands on my hips, spun around and glared at him straight in the eye, and I never saw him again. I wouldn't go walking at night though without my husband. Having a restaurant on site would have been nice, but it wasn't the end of the world. Would have liked to have seen the hotel provide a more detailed guide of area restaurants and attractions. It was difficult for us to decide where to go since we were never sure what was really in our neighborhood and what was several miles away. In all though, Pacific Terrace is a very nice hotel. GREAT rooms with plenty of space, plenty of towels outside our door every morning, good maid service, nice staff, continental breakfast, wine in the evening, but still left me wishing for an on-site restaurant and slightly easier access to the beach. But again, I still haven't heard of any luxury hotel in the San Diego area that's closer to the beach than this one, so until I do, I still rate this one as a winner.", "Date": "December 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ventura, California", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Venturagal", "ReviewID": "UR11516241", "Content": "We really loved this hotel.

La Jolla was only 10 minutes away. Second best are the rooms - just gorgeous and very comfortable. The plasma TV was a nice luxury. The neighborhood around the hotel (Pacific Beach) caters to 20 somethings with lots of surf shops, bars, restaurants and boutiques. It wasn't our scene but we felt safe to walk around and enjoyed eating at the various restaurants. The Broken Yolk for breakfast was great. The hotel's continental breakfast is nice, but simple.

We booked the hotel last November based on Trip Advisor reviews...Recent reviews, with focus on the surrounding neighborhood, made us a little nervous, so we went in to the trip with low expectations. With a few minor exceptions, PT met or exceeded our expectations. What we liked: THE BEACH: It's right there, right out your window, and it's beautiful. The first couple of days, there was a lot of seaweed, but then the huge raking tractors and dump trucks came and took all that away. The surf is wonderfully noisy at night and the water is shallow for some great wading and wave jumping. We took surf lessons with Rusty Farrell (you can get his number from the hotel) and the kids (and my husband) had a blast learning to surf. THE LOCATION: Pacific Beach (PB to the locals) is a hoot. It is young, hip, laid back and great for people-watching. We loved watching all the cyclists go by on funky bikes with surf boards tucked under their arms or tiny dogs tucked into baskets on handle-bars. There are great swim shops, tattoo parlors, taco joints and bar and grills. You WILL see homeless people, but we were never panhandled to or felt unsafe. THE ROOMS: Now, we were spoiled with a premium ocean front junior suite, so I can't speak to some of the other reviews that complain about the rooms. Ours was perfect - nice balcony looking straight out to the ocean, eat-in bar, refrigerator, microwave, sink, dishes and silverware...The TV was fine - we rarely turned it on. The IPOD docking station was great...Our bathroom was well-appointed and always stocked with towels of all sizes. There was a minibar that we didn't touch...In room safe - yes, it was small - but it held our small valuables just fine. Nightly turn-down service with chocolates and light music playing on the radio was fun to come home to. We were nervous at first because our room faced the elevator, and previous reviews complained about noise, but we never noticed a thing. THE STAFF: The staff go out of their way to accommodate all requests. Nicole at the pool did an incredible job of keeping wine glasses overflowing during the 4-5 p.m. wine hour (she even offered to send someone out for my Diet Coke when we discovered the soda machine only carried Pepsi products). She also was quick with freshly baked cookies for the kids and would slice up an apple for the kids almost without having to ask. The front desk staff remembered our names, had our car brought out promptly when we needed it and were genuinely always happy to see us. Housekeeping staff were unobtrusive but also always smiling and saying hello when you passed them in the halls. One of our daughters liked sleeping on the floor in the adjacent kids' room. She made a nest of blankets and pillows and was quite happy there, preferring that over the aerobed we had rented. At night, when we returned to our rooms, the housekeepers would have arranged her nest with cozy pillows, propping up my daughter's doll and stuffed animal and making a canopy with the doll blanket. Too cute. Things to Consider: BREAKFAST: As other reviewers have mentioned, there is no restaurant on site so breakfast in the morning is a continental buffet. Given the space available to them, I think the hotel does a great job. There were muffins, pastries, croissants, bagels, and English muffins (with jams, honey, butter and peanut butter to top). Cold and hot cereal, fresh fruit (apples, orange slices, bananas, melon), orange, grape, and apple juices, milk, coffee and tea. We tend to like a lot of protein for breakfast, so after a couple of days we ventured out to Kono's (highly recommend) for their breakfast burritos. All in all, the breakfast worked for us most days and, again, the staff were so friendly and willing to help, it was a really pleasant way to start the day. Be prepared for the flies, though. The hallway along the breakfast area is \"open\" to the outside and most of the seating is outside on the patio, and flies, as we've experienced in other tropical locations, are happy to join you for your every meal. DINING: As there is no on-site restaurant, you need to venture off-site for lunch and dinner. The hotel provides a list of recommended restaurants, and there are many close by that are actually pretty good. It would have been nice to have had a restaurant in the hotel - it did get a bit tedious trying to figure out each day where to get the next meal - but it was also a great way to see the surrounding area and get out. We did end up bringing food to the pool one night which turned out to be one of the best memories of the trip... FOLLOW UP: We had a couple of glitches with the front desk and concierge that just proves the point you can never follow up enough. We learned the first night that many of the reservations I'd requested via email weeks before with the concierge just hadn't been made...Also, a couple of requests to the front desk required a follow up call. Nothing major, but worth noting. FAMILY OR LUXURY?: With the price tag, you might be tempted to think of PT as luxury. But, in our experience, while close, PT is much more a place where families can spend a relaxing vacation, on a beautiful beach location, enjoy the pool and be close to all that San Diego has to offer. We were so pleased that there were other families with children - and we met some great people we hope to keep in touch with - but could understand that those without children, who may have been expecting a quiet, romantic, luxurious hotel stay may not have gotten what they paid for. Know that the pool is open until 10 p.m. and it's mostly families - with boisterous, young children who are in it until then. If we ever find ourselves again in the San Diego area, we will definitely stay at the Pacific Terrace.", "Date": "August 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cspectacular views\u201d", "Author": "taffy87", "ReviewID": "UR8504949", "Content": "My mom, sister, and I came to San Diego for my sister's 40th birthday.

On the positive side: 1. The customer service could not have been much nicer. Everyone was warm and friendly from the maids to the check in desk. VERY warm. Even the maintenance folks were very nice and went out of their way for us. 2. The pool is delightful. Small, but very warm. So easy to get into it. A good hot water shower is located poolside so if you are coming in from the beach you can rinse of thoroughly before going in the pool or into the hotel. There are nice fluffy chair covers and plenty of towels. The pool is basically oceanside although a wall is there to assure privacy. 3. The hotel is very clean. Maids come right away when you leave your room and do a very fine job of cleaning everything. Turndown service is nice with chocolates! 4. The location is great in that you are steps from the beach, close to many bars and restaurants - - all in walking distance. And you are ON the beach. The oceanfront room we stayed in had excellent views and a nice sized balcony with two chairs and a table. 5. Fantastic plasma television! Have never seen better in a hotel. On the negative side: 1. This particular area of San Diego could be described as having \"local color\". There's a good number of beach bums, BMX bikers, lots of body art and piercings, etc. We were asked by a few people to give them our doggie bags from the restaurants, but no one actually out and out begged for money. I never felt unsafe at any time. But I can see how this might bother some folks . . . 2. There were some maintenance issues during our stay. Our bathtub was leaking water into the room below. Unfortunately, they decided to fix this issue at the exact time we were returning from the beach and wanted to take showers. I was annoyed to be honest, but the chief engineer was very, very apologetic. He actually came down to get us at the pool when he was done with his work. They really could not have handled it any better than they did. We also had A/C issues. Everyday, the AC turned off on its own, and an engineer needed to come turn it on. A bit annoying, but it always ended up working. 3. The hotel doesn't have a restaurant or poolside bar service. Frankly, I think this was its biggest flaw. They provide room service through two local restaurants - - Chilis and a sort of sports bar. The sports bar does have good food, but I like to just be able to grab something spur of the moment and there's no way to do that. The hotel provides breakfast which I'd describe as very fair. If you just like cereal, milk, and a banana - - you are all set. They provide tons of pasteries that are totally nothing special. Their bagels are pretty much awful - - I'd give them a 3 on a 1 to 10 scale. The English Muffins are Thomas' and are fine. But the worst part is that the layout makes NO SENSE. The toasters are blocking access to the fruit bowls, and everyone is standing waiting for these very slow toasters to deliver the goods and meanwhile blocking others from getting their food. When you eat breakfast, I highly suggest bringing your food outside - - it's much more comfortable and pleasant there. There is also free wine from 4-5 which is a lovely touch, but it would be great to be able to buy a drink to have by the pool at other times of the day. 4. If you are going for the beach, the beach is good, but not fabulous. There's tons of seaweed actually on it (not in the water though). It's long and good for running. It has good waves for boogie boarding and surfing. The water (being the Pacific) was cold, but totally bearable. All in all, we liked it a did our kids. 5. The parking garage is a tight both in terms of space and the number of cars it can handle. We rented a GMC Acadia - - any bigger than that and you'd be seriously struggling to park. 6. The beds have great linens, but somehow weren't super comfortable. A bit too firm for my taste. If you like firm, you'd be very happy. The overall feeling is nice as the linens are high quality.

I had booked the hotel as the reviews were positive and it described itself as luxury. We were disappointed as it is certainly not luxury. On the positive side the staff were friendly and helpful and the location in terms of access to a wonderful beach great. However, there were a number of factors that seriously detract from the experience. Probably the major one is the very poor \u2018Continental\u2019 breakfast. It is described in their in-room video as Gourmet; it certainly was not. A luxury hotel does not serve up a selection of pastries and packets of cereals in a school tuck-shop setting using cheap plastic cups and plates, surrounded by flies and expect to call that a luxurious experience. The lack of dining facilities, or indeed what appeared to be any form of cooking facilities, meant that we dined out each evening. The local area is really geared toward the younger generation, i.e. teens/early twenties and not forty-two with a wife and two children. Hence, the dining alternatives tended to be Grilles attached to Bars and were not really suitable for a family. Note that the area was not threatening, it\u2019s just that the options were not really places you would take your family. The next aspect was the bathroom. In fact the shower (above a small bath) and toilet were in an en-suite that is best described as being close to a downstairs utility room. It was not a luxurious bathing experience. I have noticed in the photos posted by other reviewers that other bathrooms looked larger. We stayed in a Partial Ocean View room; maybe other types of rooms are better. We also had problems with our air conditioning, it worked very rarely and the room window could not be locked. Also, the in-room safe was small, so that you couldn\u2019t fit in anything bigger than a mid-sized camera. Although the furniture was OK, the general appearance of the hotel was of being in need of a renovation, for example, the carpets were dated and the balcony floor covering was pealing. We didn\u2019t use the pool, as we preferred the beach. However, it did not look particularly inviting and there was no pool-side bar, as far as I could gather. Would I stay there again.

The large, well-appointed rooms offer comfort and either indirect or direct ocean views. The location is close to Sea World and sits along the Mission Blvd. strip of restaurants, shops, and bars. The strong point of this property is the rooms. They are spacious, comfortable, and well-maintained. Our room, number 317, was a \u201cpremium ocean view junior suite\u201d that featured a wonderful ocean view. It is a one-room suite with dimensions of about 17x35 feet, excluding the dressing and bath area. We enjoyed leaving the balcony\u2019s glass sliding door open at night, since the hotel is close enough to the beach to allow the sound of surf to lull us to sleep. We were able to close the screen door to exclude insects and adjust the wooden louver doors for privacy without losing the ocean\u2019s soothing sound. The room was furnished in heavier, higher-quality furniture. The room was available with either two queens or a king with sofa bed. Accompanied by two children, we chose the two queens, which were massive; the mattresses were boxed in by a wide wooden frame, so that one would occasionally bump it when moving in or out of the bed. The beds faced a modular shelving unit that contained a 42\u201d flat-screen HDTV, drawer space, and lighted shelves with inexpensive sculptures, etc. There was a two-chair seating group near the balcony door, a desk, and a table with four chairs. All were appointed with nice coverings in bold colors, and nothing seemed worn or dirty. At the table end of the room, there was a kitchenette with sink, microwave, undercounter refrigerator, and dinnerware. There was also a locked, second refrigerator stocked as a mini-bar. We never used the facilities to prepare meals, because of the abundance of restaurants within easy walking distance. Several restaurants allow your meal to be charged back to the hotel, and two restaurants will deliver to your room with a small service charge, again billed to your account. We tried that the first night we arrived, and the food was delivered by hotel staff, warm, within about 45 minutes. The bathroom area was more modest, although the hotel offers more bathroom features in an \u201cexecutive suite\u201d category that was sold out when we reserved. The sink in our room was in a separate dressing area with a closet and vanity with generous marble counter space. The toilet and shower were very average, located in a small room off the dressing area. The toiletries were \u201cGilcrest and Soams\u201d, which I believe to be a European hotel supplier\u2019s brand. The room rate includes a cold continental breakfast and late-afternoon happy hour. We did partake in breakfast every morning, with a selection of bagels, rolls, cereals, yoghurt, and fruit. There would also be two juices available. After a few days, the limited selection became somewhat tedious. The hotel has no restaurant other than the breakfast room. Breakfast could be eaten inside or out. The San Diego climate made breakfast by the pool very enjoyable. In late June, the mornings would be quite crisp, limiting ocean bathing, but enhancing lounging around the pool. The modest pool was heated and had an adjacent whirlpool tub. During our stay, it was never crowded. We never made it to the happy hour. It was held only from 4-5 p.m., and we would always be away from the hotel. Parking was available under the hotel for $18 per day. The garage is accessed through a gate controlled by the room key card, and there are elevators at each end that rise upward to the lobby and the rooms. There are a limited number of free spaces adjacent to the hotel, but they often were unavailable. Especially if you plan to be coming and going in your vehicle, the underground parking is a good investment, and can be decided upon at arrival. There is a tiny gift shop off the lobby, and the front desk can provide tickets to local attractions at a small (typically $2 per person) discount. The hotel straddles the beachfront promenade, which is itself atop a 20-foot cliff above the beach and the Pacific Ocean, both reached by nearby stairs. Although there is a comfortable expanse of sand, the beach experience was marred by tons of seaweed and dead marine life, at least during our visit. There were very few seashells along the beach, disappointing our 7 and 9 year old girls, but they enjoyed watching the surfers in the water next to the pier, just south of the hotel. By the time we left, the younger announced that she wanted surfing lessons. From the hotel, it is a ten-minute drive south to Sea World, and fifteen minutes to the Old Town area. The strip of restaurants and bars surrounding the hotel stays active until late, and drew some who seemed potentially problematic. Although not a major issue, there is a slight risk of encountering boisterous or confrontational conduct later in the evening. We stayed at a peak time, so the rates were high (over $500/night for our room, taxes and parking, even with an AAA discount) and the value was acceptable, but not great. We were not upgraded as others have reported, possibly because the property was busy. However, we recommend this hotel, primarily based its oceanfront location and the room features. It does not have elaborate public areas or a huge pool area, and the limited staff provided adequate, but not instant, service. Because the hotel is not large, there is no hustle-bustle, which we appreciated. We regretted not having planned more time to enjoy the room, beach and pool.", "Date": "July 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cPricey but wonderful\u201d", "Author": "rubberducky", "ReviewID": "UR8091836", "Content": "Well I don't know how you get a \"deal\" on this place but I couldn't manage it for the life of me... and I worked hard... lol We are a family of four - we are in the mid to late 30's and our children are 2 and 4. We have stayed in San Diego twice before, once at the Welk Estates in Escondito (love it, but only if you're staying for a week or so) and at the Bahia Resort Hotel at Mission Beach - before the reno's. I really wanted to stay here but the price US$450 scared the bejeezers out of me. This trip I was on business and could write off our hotel stay so I jumped at the opportunity. I read lots of reviews that complimented the hotel and since it's #1 in San Diego how could we go wrong. Just after I booked I read the latest review about the area being a dump and I got scared... however there was no going back... We arrived on July 6th at about 4pm... check in was quick and fast thanks to Humberto (Tito), they have parking underneath the hotel for $18 a night which was great because then it's a quick elevator ride to your hotel room. We stayed in a oceanview room on the second floor middle of the hotel. The room was huge, beautifully appointed and comfortable. The balcony was great with an amazing view. The beds are about four and a half feet high with a little step stool to climb up... There is a bar fridge and a mini bar. Never tried the internet but apparently there is wireless... We got changed quickly and ran for the pool (we had just driven up from Ensenada). There was free wine hour from 4 to 5 and lemonade for the kids. The wine was excellent, white, red and blush and the service was great. We had a quick glass on the patio and then changed over to plastic glasses and went for a dip. The pool isn't huge but is adequate for the most part, only occasionally crowded. The hot tub was great and the view of the surfers was fun to watch. The area around the hotel is funky and fun. We walked all over... ate at World Famous the first night and Gringo's the second night. I lost my nose ring and bought one around the corner at the tatoo parlour. We felt completely safe and happy in the area and after eating dinner at World Famous walked back along the beach skipping the surf with the kids at 11pm a night. There were a few homeless people sipping beers, etc. but no one was violent or scary. The beach is beautiful and clean and we met lots of the vendors along the way in their little shops who were so nice and helpful. We ate breakfast at The Broken Yolk on Garnet both mornings... mmm best omelets ever!! Dinner at World Famous was ok, the appy's were great but the main courses were hit and miss, the prime rib was good, the steak not all that interesting. Dinner at Gringo's was ok too.. the appy's were fabulous, however the traditional Mexican food we ordered was not our favorite and we wish we had ordered fajita's instead. At about 11pm on Saturday night there was a little yahoo going on in the pool, it lasted about 15 minutes before hotel staff cleared them out without incident, however it was very loud for a few minutes. We had a problem with dripping water over our vanity. I called the front desk and they sent the repair man, who looked at it and told me he would resolve it while we were out. When we came back it seemed to have be fixed, however overnight the drip came back and our whole vanity was flooded including all our bathroom stuff, it was a big mess. I complained when we checked out and they comp'd our parking so $36 credit, which was nice. So here's our list of pros: - amazing location, fun, hip and interesting - beautiful hotel - fabulous service - great pool area, fun to hang out at - wonderful sandy beach - entertaining watching the surfers - fun boardwalk to walk along - comfy beds/linens - tv was huge and lots of options - small bar fridge (good for leftovers and cold drinks, etc.) - lots of good restaurants/shopping near by (walking distance) List of cons: - very expensive - have to pay for parking - noisy - we didn't mind at all (in fact we like it) but if you're looking for peace and quiet you probably won't find it here between the surf crashing and the people around the pool We never even went into San Diego proper this trip, we loved the Pacific Beach area so much... we visited Sea World on Saturday and that was excellent, however it's a two day excursion with little people and we didn't get to see everything in one day...

Not sure how everybody seems to get such a good rate, but we booked through hotel website at $420 a night! This was our most expensive hotel during a 3 week stay, but certainly not the best. You are paying for the view. The hotel does not have a restaurant, so any room service is brought in from outside restaurants. The breakfast is served in a very small room downstairs. You can have cereals, small selection of fruit and toasted bagels, It's the same every day and there were never enough bowls etc, so you had to have polystyrene bowls which you are supposed to use if you want to take breakfast to your room. The most disappointing thing is the surrounding area, it's a dump!! The hotel said they had restaurants that you could sign a tab and they would bill the hotel, so that you did not have to carry your wallet around at night, this seems to me its because the area is so dreadful. We were recommended one restaurant by a local chap who got chatting to us outside the hotel, its called Nicks by the beach, very nice food and good service, its about a five block walk. All other nights we drove into the city and went to Seaport Village, about a 15 min drive. It's on the waterfront and has some good restaurants. We also went to La Jolla which is lovely. Wonderful area, great restaurants. Very easy to get to Seaworld and San Diego Zoo, both about 10 - 20mins drive. If we stayed here again, we would stay in La Jolla and certainly not Pacific Beach, the other reviews have said this is a dump, but I didn't quite believe it until I saw it.

My review is a bit late, but it was such a great hotel that I wanted to chime in. We stayed here in Sept. 06. We were there with 3 young kids 5 and under. We all had such a great time. The room was spacious, clean and beautiful. We had a 1st floor patio room, which was very nice with the kids to be able to access the pool so easily. Also, it was a great place to sit and drink free wine/lemonade while the sunset. Nice for eating breakfast and even dinner. One night we brought home a pizza from a joint just down the street and ate it on the patio. The staff was amazing. The free breakfast was really good. So good that we never even made it to Kona's for breakfast, and that is our favorite breakfast place in the world! It was very convenient to the beach, and great people watching. the kids loved the free cookies and chocolates. I can't begin to say how wonderful our experience was here! We walked down PB at night to go eat and we never felt the least bit unsafe, even with 3 small kids. Frankly, I'm dumbfounded about the few bad reviews about this hotel. I can't imagine what those people would like. My husband and I stayed at the Four Seasons Maui and Four Seasons on the Big Island just a couple of months before our SD trip, and it was on par with that experience. Mind you, no one is coming around spritzing you with Evian at the Pacific Terrace like they did at the Four Seasons Maui, but that's a bit much anyway, even for the Four Seasons. And, I'm not saying that the facilities and amenities are equal to the Four Seasons, but the experience was just as good, and it was a fraction of the cost. As for the complaints about the work out facility--who in their right mind would want to work out in a gym when you have miles of paths along the ocean (not to mention the ocean and the beach) literally right out the back door?

We stayed 2 nights at Loew's Coronado Bay Resort (loved it!) then drove here for 2 nights because I wanted to have a room right on the beach to actually hear ocean waves crashing against the shoreline (you won't get this on any of the bays, artificial beaches or marinas in the area). What a culture shock leaving lovely, serene and secluded Coronado to drive through this overcrowded, busy, dumpy neighborhood lined filled with low rent apartments and 1 star motels. The only other decent hotels I noticed in the immediate area were Tower 23 and the Crystal Pier cottages which despite my dislike for the location I may try out someday just because they are so unique. THE ROOM: we got a premium ocean view suite on the 2nd floor. It was an outstanding, clean beautifully furnished room complete with sink, refrigerator, microwave oven, huge flat screen, dock for your MP3 player on the clock radio. The beds were cozy. But I don't like comforters and throw pillows (they are pretty but how sanitary are they?). My first morning of enjoying the ocean waves was interrupted too early in the morning by loud children playing near the pool area or one of the nearby balconies. THE HOTEL: staff was friendly but not extraordinary. I'd question their recommendations for dining. Two of the staff members highly recommended a place called The World Famous. What a dud recommendation. We drove to the place, could not find parking space anywhere within a few blocks so we drove up to the valet booth where we got ignored. I went inside to the hostess who told me there was a 45 minute wait. I scanned the place and it too looked like a dump. I guess the view is what attracts people to that dumpy restaurant. We drove off to Nick's around the corner and got immediate seating which was alright but not as good as the one in Maui. Our 2nd night I was much more clear with the concierge when I told her I wanted an elegant restaurant with a view in La Jolla. She recommended \"Azul\" which we LOVED and I highly recommend for amazing views, romantic and calm atmosphere and fantastic gourmet dinners and desserts. The continental breakfast was a plus even though our first day we walked to Hennessey's Pub for a good breakfast. The hotel staff had laid out a nice spread of pastries, bagels and cream cheese, yogurt, juices, etc. THE BEACH: fabulous! The walking path just beyond the pool area has nice views of the beach, there's a separate bike path too. THE LOCATION: on the plus side there are a lot of restaurants, cafe's and pubs/bars within walking distance which is great if you don't want to drive anywhere. But what a huge step down from Coronado and La Jolla this area of Pacific Beach is. I think it's because it's a very old neighborhood. If you're in your 20's or if you love to surf you'd probably love this area. The surfers are plentiful on this beach very early in the morning. Although it's a nice well maintained hotel with good staffpeople I probably would not stay anywhere in Pacific Beach again (except for maybe Crystal Pier cottages). It's nice to be on the beach but for the high rates they are charging at Pacific Terrace I'd rather stay at a full-service hotel or resort.

There is a beachwalk that is nice and very long with plenty of restaurants to choose from but the surrounding area looks a little seedy. Some of the homeless hang out near the public bathroom next to the property.. (It was and education for our kids.) Fitness center is a room off the underground garage with no windows...they should have just skipped the investment. No restaurant or bar on site.

The staff was friendly and informative, our room was clean, fresh towels left daily and nightime chocolates were a nice touch. We had a \"family suite\" room, which consisted of 2 rooms. The main room had a microwave/mini fridge, sink, sofa bed, flat screen tv, and dining table. The bedroom had a door that closed off to the sitting area (very nice for sleeping kids), inside it had 2 queen size beds, flat screen TV, IPod docking station (nice surprise), balcony entrance, bathroom area with huge counter and 2 sinks. The toilet/shower area was separate. We were on the first floor, which gave us a larger patio area, however I would prefer to stay on a higher floor next time. Better view of the ocean, and no people walking right by you on the boardwalk (just a personal preference). We paid for the parking garage and it was absolutely worth it! Don't even bother trying to find parking on the street. I used the laundry facilities once (located on the garage level) and had no problems. The morning breakfast was great. There were bagels, danish, fresh strawberries/cantaloupe, bananas, yogurt, english muffins, boxed cereals, instant oatmeal, juices/milk/coffee/tea/hot chocolate. It was very helpful to not have to leave the hotel for breakfast, much less pay $20+ for a restaurant. In the afternoon/evening, there was iced tea and lemonade by the pool. Coffee, was available almost all day/night. From 4-5 wine was served by the pool (no cost), which was wonderful...cookies for the kids in the lobby, too. The only thing we encountered was a problem with the shower doors....they leak and badly. We ended up using a few extra towels, placed on the floor, to help with the water. Do not leave your clothes on the floor or you'll be using the dryer, too! :) We ate at 3 restaurants nearby, which were recommended by the hotel: Hennessey's Pub, Bella ____ Italian food (I don't recall the entire name), and Gringo's mexican food.

There was always a fresh basket of linens outside the door the next morning in case we needed an extra towel. The included breakfast was very good with fresh fruit, cereal, pastries, juice, coffee, water, and yogurt. The afternoon wine reception was very relaxing. We sipped our wine by the pool. The pool area was beautiful and comfortable. Our 3.5 year old daughter loved the fresh baked cookies in the afternoon and adored the turn down service because she got chocolate on her bed at night! I enjoyed the free internet access in the lobby. We walked to dinner many nights. The hotel did a fantastic job of referring us to different dining spots. We really liked being able to push a stroller all along the beach on the sidewalk above. The area is difficult to pinpoint exactly. It is a 50s beach bungalow type location. There are alot of college kids that live in the area. As with any busy/large town, there were occassional homeless people along the Pacific Beach boardwalk. That being said, we were never uncomfortable. Right across from the hotel are condos that are starting at $750,000!!! The hotel was really convenient to La Jolla and to Seaworld. We loved that we stayed right on the beach and could hear the ocean. We paid $15 day to park in their garage under the hotel. They even had music playing in the garage that was relaxing.

Our experience parallels the reviews of many of the prior guests. it is a great place to stay!! Let's get this one out of the way right off ... Yes, our shower leaked a bit, but only if we weren't observant. The doors swing from the walls, meeting in the middle of the tub opening. It is great for getting in and out of the tub, but can leak if you don't get the doors closed in the correct sequence over the side of the tub. This did not ruin our stay. The staff is indeed friendly. We arrived early and were given access to the pool area and general facilities while we waited. Being a holiday week, we did not get an upgrade, but were pleasantly surprised by the view from our 'partial ocean view' room. (see photos) It may be that since we arrived early, we may have gotten the two prime POV rooms that were available. Our room was larger than the room that our kids had because theirs lost some of the footprint to the stairwell. This is something you may want to watch for even in the second floor Ocean View rooms. The breakfast was sufficient and ample, but lacked any form of protein other than yogurt. The selection of scones, muffins, pastries, cereal and fresh fruit should keep most appetites at bay for the morning. It was very nice to not have to get up, get dressed and go find breakfast. There is an interesting, reasonalby priced breakfast stand just down the walkway from the hotel that had people lined up out the door each day. The grounds are very well kept and groomed. The pool and spa are very well maintained and their are plenty of towels by the pool and in baskets by the rooms that can be used from until the rooms are serviced. Our only complaints regard a few details in the room ... a noisy AC system fan that was irritating, plantation shutters that were not properly installed and didn't slide well and a few needed paint touch ups. It appeared that the room had recently had some rennovations that just weren't well finished. It was obvious that new carpet had just been installed in the stairway, so upgrades are in process. Also, the bell on the elevator door is really annoying! The 42\" plasma TV was so good that even my wife enjoyed watching it. You do get a bit of price break on tickets to major attractions by booking through the concierge. When we go back, and we will go back, we will upgrade to an Ocean View room.

From 4-5PM they have wine. The view and location cannot be beat. Parking is $15 per day, however, they do have a few free slot and there is parking on the street.

Turn down service is nice, if you like that. Beautiful sunset view. Nice warm outdoor shower for those returning from the beach. Good spa services available. Fun to watch surfers from balcony. Cons: Surrounding neighborhood is rundown and sketchy for walking at night -- safe, but not nice (ex. young men sharing a joint on the sidewalk, many vagrants). Very urban. Not a lot of familes walking around at night. (Boardwalk area OK during the day. Lots of joggers. ) Housekeeping was pleasant but not thorough; did not remove our trash every day even when full. Parking is $15/day billed automatically. Your responsibility to ask them to remove the charges if you don't use garage. We used the free parking in the alley. My strongest dislike was having to go to the garage to use guest laundry. Very isolated area. Neutral: Breakfast is OK, all carbs (cereals, pastries, fruit). Wine hour is nice but wine is low end (you get what you pay for when it's free). No snacks available; bring your own. Jr suites are significantly larger than 2 bedded rooms. Beach chairs available for $5/day. They are extremely heavy and awkward. Supply own lightweight chair, if possible. Beach can be very windy. Some good restaurants but not a large number of family oriented places. Definitely the surfer bar part of town. Try Kafe' Zen for great Thai food. Many restaurants deliver to hotel. This hotel could use its own restaurant. Overall, I just loved it and would love to return. I know I listed some cons, but I wanted to be thorough.

You know what I mean.......when you expect something to be so good, it's always a let down. After a horrible overnight flight from a fantastic week in Hawaii and an extremely irritating 4 hour drive from LAX, we pulled up at Pacific Terrace. We had not slept for over 24 hours and must have looked like the living dead..........we certainly felt like it! However from the moment we stepped inside, we were made to feel so comfortable and welcome, we knew this place was different from most hotels. Our room was to die for - it was huge. We had paid for a Deluxe Ocean View Room, but randomly got upgraded to a Deluxe Ocean View Suite. It was fantastic. The bed was so comfortable, the massive HD ready Plasma TV unbelievable, the bar and kitchen area (which we were not expecting at all) were great and the balcony and view were spectacular. The pool area, although small, was more than adequate for the size of the hotel and was so well looked after. If you're around the pool area at 4.00pm each afternoon, a trolley gets wheeled out with a complimentary selection of wine for guests.

However, all these things said, the thing that really puts this hotel in a league of its own is the staff. I've stayed in a lot of different accommodations in my time and I can without hesitation say these guys were the best. Not only were they so very helpful and efficient, but their general manor and friendliness was really heart warming.

We really wanted to treat ourselves and stay somewhere near the ocean with a nice view, but were unsure of which hotel we should select. When we stumbled upon the Pacific Terrace Hotel and read all of the reviews about this \"diamond in the rough\", we decided to give it a try. I have to be honest...we thought the reviews might be a little too good to be true. However, let me tell you...WE LOVED EVERY MINUTE of our stay. When we checked in, the staff was very friendly and truly went out of their way to ensure our stay was as wonderful as possible. Upon entering our suite...and I know my mouth dropped wide open...the bellman said, \"Enjoy your stay with us\". Our room was just BEAUTIFUL! We loved the turn-down service and chocolates at night and the 4-5 p.m. wine at the pool. The continental breakfast each morning was very nice with a plentiful selection and great coffee. We talked about planning our next vacation around our stay at this WONDERFUL hotel. I can't wait!!!

First of all, my wife and I were vacationing with our two children ages 4.5 and 6. A 'Welcome' email from the hotel was received a day prior to our arrival, suggesting we prepare for relaxation\u2026a nice way to begin. Our 5 pm check-in was smooth, especially for the busy holiday weekend. The staff at the front desk was courteous, professional and efficient. The bellman, Rich, was particularly helpful in pointing out all of the features of the property (pool, breakfast/wine hour, parking, etc.) and our stunning room. We booked an executive suite as it was the only way to GUARANTEE that we receive a room with two queen beds. Premium ocean view and Jr. suites are offered with both King/sofa bed or 2 queen configurations and while the hotel tries to accommodate all requests there are no guarantees. The room exceeded our expectations. Out third floor suite was very spacious and nicely appointed. Notable amenities: 42\u201d plasma TV, large double sliding doors w/ plantation shutters, ocean view patio w/ seating for four, wet bar w/ microwave. The bathroom was exceptionally large and had a jetted tub. The room was clean and well cared for. Our room was located on the north side of the hotel facing the Capri and the ocean. Rooms on the south side look out toward Crystal Pier. There was enough noise at street level that we chose to close the sliders at night. I\u2019m not sure if the rooms that directly face the ocean would be quieter as they are adjacent to the pool, beach and beach walk. The pool facility was appropriately sized for the hotel. Pool and hot tub were heated to 85 and 104 deg. respectively. There were no age restrictions for the hot tub. I believe the hours were 7-10 a.m. Seating was adequate and towels plentiful. Additional shade seating would be nice. This is NOT the \u2018send your nanny down in the morning to reserve a lounge chair\u2019 pool scene. Very relaxed and laid back. Deluxe continental breakfast is served from 7-10am and is well stocked and plentiful. Pastries, bagels, cereals, fresh fruits, yogurts, juice, coffee, tea and milk are offered. Seating is cozy inside or one can dine outside near the pool. It seemed that most guests took advantage of the complimentary breakfast. Iced tea and lemonade are available throughout the day as are an assortment of board games. Complementary wine hour is from 4-5 p.m. by the pool. The hotel DOES NOT have a restaurant or pool side bar service, however, there is fare from two local restaurants to choose from for room service or pool side delivery. Guests are also able to charge back to their room at several other nearby restaurants. Location is ideal. The hotel is located in Pacific Beach just north of Crystal Pier and shares an oceanfront location next to the Capri By The Sea condominiums. Beach access is just out the secured gates. Activities are plentiful. There are several restaurants nearby and worthy of mentioning: The Fishery, PB at Cass and Opal (.8 mile from hotel), an inland neighborhood eatery (no ocean view) delicious, FRESH seafood. Station Sushi, Solana Beach, if you\u2019re up north (and returning to the hotel from Legoland) it\u2019s well worth the stop. Great hotel staff recommendation! Taco Surf, PB, Mission Boulevard between Felspar and Emerald, GREAT taco eatery just a block away. Take-out for pool-side dining. I would not recommend Taylor\u2019s. Service was slow, food mediocre and ambiance just so-so. The fitness room was under construction and was going to be \u2018very small\u2019 according to staff. We did not utilize any offsite fitness facility. Parking located beneath the hotel was adequate and secure; I believe it was $17 a night. The hotel also provided 10 first-come first-serve spaces in the alley behind the hotel at no charge. Surface/street parking is difficult due to the desirable beach location. Hotel checkout is 11 a.m. I had inquired about a late checkout when I booked our room two months prior to our stay and was told it would not be a problem, so I booked a late returning flight to Reno to maximize our stay. However, this request was denied the night before our departure due to the \u2018unusually high amount of room turnover\u2019. In the end, we were extended until noon and were able to use all the hotel facilities (less the room) until 3 p.m. So what cold be done better? Tough question. There were a few noticeable exterior \u2018wear and tear\u2019 marine environment issues (peeling paint, rusty metal) that could be repaired. A small pool side bar might be nice to aid in relaxation. One or two of the staff seemed overwhelmed by the demands and volume of guests and were neither helpful nor responsive to guest requests\u2026find replacements ASAP that are truly dedicated to guest service.

When I am traveling on vacation with my young kids, it's tough to fit in some time to exercise so I try to keep the time I am away doing that as short as possible. So now I have to spend nearly 25 minutes walking back and forth to a local club that costs me $11 to use each time. I travel several dozen times a year -- mostly for business and a few times for pleasure -- and to me nearby fitness facilities mean an elevator ride away or at most across the street. So today I barely had time to try to fit this in and trek off to the local club only to be told that I cannot use their facilities because I don't have ID with me -- of which the hotel made no mention that it would be required. So I end up out walking around for nearly half an hour and don't get time to get in some exercise because that would mean me being gone another hour and a half from my wife and kids. Hardly what they expect from me on a family vacation. Other comments: - it was -physically impossible to take a shower in our bathroom without flooding the floor with water because a large gap between the shower stall and the wall. It was a pain in the neck to have to mop up after every single shower which required us calling to ask for more towels and bath mats. - Their coffee is terrible.

The rooms are very nice and upscale. Staff is very friendly and helpful and create a very laid back atmosphere. They offer a small complimentary continental breakfast every morning which is nice. It is not a trendy hotel. So, if you are looking at a place to be seen this is not it. Yes, there are sufers, college kids, and bums that hang out on the beach. I've never had a problem with any of them but if they bother you then go out to Coronado or La Jolla. This hotel has been great for our kids as the small pool is warm and not very crowded. It is does not have an onsite restaurant or bar. So, if you want 4 star service while sitting by the pool then this is not the place. If you don't mind walking down the beach to dinner or bars then this is not a problem as there are many. Also, we have 3 small kids and there are many walk up fast food places very close if you don't feel like a formal dinner. I would also say the entire Pacific/Mission Beach area is pretty laid back. There aren't any 5 star restaurants within walking distance. There are many decent places to eat but you have to go to Gaslamp or downtown for the trendy places. The area is definitely on the upswing with real estate booming. It is also much more exciting than La Jolla or Coronado, which are good for shopping, but pretty boring IMHO other than that. The beach at the hotel is great. There is some seaweed around whereas Coronado keeps the beach pretty clean. There is also a 2-4 foot break for body surfing. Overall, without a doubt, one of my favorite hotels anywhere and easily my favorite in Southern Cal.

On the beachfront promenade, you will see all types of people from young to old. The hotel was being painted even though their web site said that the renovations had been completed earlier in the month. Our room had a very strong smell of paint the first two nights. The hallway carpets were dirty. Perhaps they will be cleaned or replaced after the renovations are complete. I thought the pool and spa areas were lovely. There was also abundant landscaping. Parking under the hotel was very convenient and secure. Despite a few deficiencies that I mentioned in this review, I would highly recommend this hotel at the discounted winter rate of $195.

It was very clean, plenty of piping hot water and the beds were sooo comfy. We thought the breakfast provided was way above average - plenty of cereals to choose from, fresh fruit and fresh croissants/bagels danish etc. There were also plenty of highchairs - clean ones with working harnesses!! If you choose to get breakfast out there is an abumdance of eateries along the boardwalk (and it's only a 5 min walk to Starbucks!). There's also a great supermarket there where you can pick up supplies to store in your refrigerator. At 4pm-5pm there was complimentary wine tasting which was a lovely touch, there was hot water and coffee provided all day (just help yourself) and cookies at the front desk. Unlike others, we found the $15 a day parking convenient. We could load the kids up easily in the underground parking and did not have to fight for street parking. The key card worked every time so no problems there. The pool area was spotless - even though the weather was unusually cool when we were there, we could still swim and even take the baby in. The beach was a bit grubby and there was a lot of seaweed but we didn't really want to go down there anyway; the view however is beautiful - a lovely sunset most evenings and we even saw dolphins playing off the end of the pier. Yes, there are a few down and outs who \"live\" along the boardwalk, but all were friendly and non-threatening and it did not put us off wandering along the boardwalk each evening for a stroll with the kids. If you enjoy running, this is a great place to exercise and join the many other runners who seemed to be out all day. This is a wonderful accommodation - we think it's one of the nicest hotels we've ever stayed in (and we've stayed in some pretty swanky hotels). It's small, quiet, the staff are incredibly helpful and efficient and it's very well positioned. We went out every day and the longest we were in the car was on the journey up to Legoland (40 mins). By the way, the hotel has a brilliant sheet with detailed directions to all the major sights. We didn't need a map or even a guidebook - it was all provided for us. Most of the sights are easily within a 20 minute radius, probably less. We bought our tickets at the front desk which saved a few bucks and beat the lines at the entrances.

Very helpful and friendly staff on the front desk at check-in. In fact all the staff I met, whatever their role at the hotel, where friendly and helpful. If you have a car secure underground parking is $15 per night (I think on a first come basis, we didn't have a car). There is some street parking, but follow the advice of the front desk as to where as I did hear her telling one guest that they do ticket every night in some places. We booked an Executive Suite. This room was enormous! We had 2 king beds with a pillow top mattress type thing that was very comfortable. A sofa, 2 easy chairs, coffee table, desk & chair, 'proper' size dining table and chairs for 4 people. The kitchenette consisted of a sink, fridge, microwave, 3 elec ring stove top with small oven, coffee machine plus plates, cutlery, glasses etc and pots and pans. My only minor quibble is the TV angled towards the beds, rather than the sofa, which meant I tended to drop-off to sleep on that very inviting bed of an evening and miss the end of whatever I was watching! The bathroom was also huge with a 2 person jacuzzi, seperate shower stall and seperate WC also. The wardrobe is in the bathroom which sort of turns this room into a dressing-room. Lots of towels and toiletries and they topped up the toiletries each day too - not a thing that always happens. Lovely soap! There is a phone and TV in the bathroom. Two nice terry robes too. Each evening, around 6.15/6.30pm, housekeeping would arrive and turn back the beds, leave chocolates on the pillow, draw the curtains, turn on the side lamps and leave the radio playing music for your return. We had a big balcony that had a sideways view up to the coast towards La Jolla. We stayed in 325. If you could get room 322 to 324 you would have an even better view. This side of the hotel you also get to see the sunset. There are ocean front rooms, these were all reserved for our dates, which I am sure are wonderful. Personally I prefer the side we were on if going for a side view (rather than the side views to Cyrstal Pier) for that sunset of an evening. The huge sliding windows to the balcony also have those 'net shutters' that mean you can leave the doors half-open for air but get no visiting bugs. Not that I saw any bugs, but a nice touch. Sitting on our peaceful balcony of a morning gazing at the Pacific, the surfers and joggers/walkers etc was hard to beat. I was travelling with just carry-on and my 10-yr-old so when I discovered there was a guest laundry down in the car park I was happy. Any Mother's reading this will relate! It's $1.25 per wash in quarters (front desk keep change), $1.25 per dryer (45 mins) and for soap and fab con. They also offer the usual laundry services.The Longs Drugstore on Mission (about 5/10 mins walk) also sell travel sizes of laundry detergent etc. The included buffet breakfast was more than adequate and you can take it up to your room if you prefer. There is a flat rate $10 charge to have breakfast delivered to your room. There was every type of cereal, oatmeal, fresh fruit, yogurt, endless pastries (muffins, croissants, scones, danish, bagels etc) preserves and spreads and all the usual beveragas (hot and cold). Between 5 and 6pm there's a free wine hour. Nice to take a glass and sit by the outdoor pool. The pool and spa face the boardwalk and beach, loungers by the pool and tables and chairs around the outer area. Lovely spot to sit - or swim if you like. Each guest gets a 'pool towel' card. Location wise I loved it! We could walk to the beach, restaurants and shops. Remember we had no car. There's a Ralph's supermarket on Mission about 10 mins walk away, as well as the Longs Drugs, for whatever supplies you might want. There's a post office at the corner of Emerald & Cass - we had to mail some purchases home! Longs sell packaging materials as does the post office. The No.9 bus (direct to Seaworld) leaves from the corner of Diamond and Faneul. About 15 mins walk along a safe residential street. Not sure what parking costs at SW but the bus is a good option if you need it. $1.75 per person each way. The bus is quite regular in both directions and there is always a printed timetable you can take from near the driver's seat. Cab fare to SW is about $13 each way with a tip. The No.34 bus is a few mins from the hotel on Mission Blvd (turn left at the corner of Diamond & Mission and across the road for the trip out, you can see the bus stop) and takes you straight to La Jolla for $2.25 per person. Ask to get off at Pearl & Girard.

Pacific Beach is kind of an older beach community. Pacific Terrace has to be the nicest hotel in the area. Right on the beach, if you can get it pay for it because it is worth it. Smaller hotel so everything is very accessible. Parking is great. Being so close to the ocean parking could be a nightmare, but their parking garage is great, pay the extra $15 I think it was well worth it. Great restaurants within walking distance. Boardwalk to stroll on right outside the hotel. Unless you are a very hard person to please you won't be dissapointed at this hotel. I didnt mention though we didnt pay anything near the rack rate of $355 for our room.

Lovely, Spacious Rooms, Very Clean. Excellent room service. Requested a late checkout (was no problem). Restaurants/Shopping Suggestions Excellent. Love Pacific Beach Area (La Jolla would be second choice) Breakfast was unlimited choices (eat in garden or on balcony in room) Wine between 4-5, cookies at front desk, also tea, coffee, lemonade all day. Pool and Hot Tub awesome. No complaints at all. Love to go back on day! Location is the best (within walking distance of shops, food, drug stores, car rentals, mission bay/beach) Overall very tourist friendly and very safe at night. Please check it out (room on 2nd or 3rd floor nice 1st floor easy access to pool and carribean room) Hope this helps!

From the minute we entered the hotel, our every need was seen too. The staff were very friendly and our room, an ocean view on the second floor, was amazing. There was a fridge in our room, so it was lovely to go into the supermarket, about a five minute walk away, grab some beers, and sit on the balcony and watch the sunset. The pool is very clean, and so is the jacuzzi. Your room card allows you to get straight out onto the boardwalk and then you just have to walk down the steps to get to the beach. Its a very friendly area and its safe to walk around at night. We wanted to go to San Diego Zoo for a day trip and the staff printed us out bus timetables and a map so we could get there in the quickest time possible. The breakfast was mainly breads and pastries, which was ok. We had two double beds in our room, and the room itself was immaculate. We had a chocolate left on our bed every night and the beds were turned down. Each morning when we got up there was a paper left outside our room. Just the little touches like that was what set this hotel apart from the others. Will definitely be coming back here.

We splurged and got an ocean view room. I don't know how many times I called the hotel to verify that the room was definitely facing the ocean. We weren't disappointed, as the room was awesome and had a full front view of the ocean and boardwalk. We were on the 3rd floor and the pool was directly below our room. The rooms all have bathrobes and slippers, which is a cute touch. You can buy the bathrobes for a price, which my friend did. The free breakfast is good--lots to choose from and you can take it outside on the patio with tables/umbrellas. As two women traveling alone we never felt scared or nervous walking the boardwalk at night. The boardwalk takes you right to some good restaurants. I will have to say parking is a problem. There are only a few 'reserved' spots for guests (without paying). A few times we had to park down the block when returning at night. But that's a small thing to deal with when you wake up to the ocean outside your balcony door! If you're thinking about staying here and question some of the reviews on here--yeah, maybe sometimes things don't go perfectly well for people, but if you want a small hotel, beautiful setting and friendly staff, this is the place.

Be forewarned...if booking an \"Ocean View\" room from Travelocity, Expedia, TraipAdvisor, etc., don't expect to get what most people consider an \"Ocean View\" room once you get to this hotel. You are better off booking only the \"Garden View\" room if you want an Internet discount because I could just barely catch a glimpse of the ocean from my \"Ocean View\" room. It was a real disappointment and downer. The only way to get an Ocean View Room is by booking directly with the hotel....as I leaned after I checked-in....and paying the 'premium' rate that isn't found on the discount internet services. I was really looking forward to our stay at this hotel after researching it on this internet sight. I could picture looking out at the ocean and watching the sunset from our room. I had the choice of booking the Garden View or Ocean View and opted for the latter. Boy...was I in for a surprise! Problem #1 - When I got to my room, it had only a king-sized bed for myself and 3 other people! The receptionist claims that Expedia didn't inform them that we had 2 kids staying with us. I showed her a hardcopy of my booking and confirmation # - which showed 2 adult and 2 kids as per the booking procedure - and she said they don't get that information from Expedia...they get different information. Say what??? So this is now my problem?? Oh well, can you please help me out and get me a room with 2 queens. Sorry sir, we're full tonight...perhaps tomorrow...you have a fold-out bed in your room that you can use. Problem #2 - They placed us on the ground-level. Looking out our patio, you needed to be 6' or taller - and standing up - to catch a glimpse of the ocean. Everything else in front of you is overgrown shrubs, flowerbeds, palms, brick privacy dividers and a 7' barred fence on the property-line. When I told the Manager that I am extremely dissappointed they consider my room as \"Ocean-View\", she said that all their ground-floor rooms are considered Ocean View as per AAA ratings or some other fancy-named agency. Can we get and \"Ocean View\" room on the 2nd or 3rd floor - even if it's for only tomorrow night?? Although you booked \"Ocean View\" over the Internet, we cannot give you an ocean-view room on the 2nd or 3rd floor because they are classified as....\"Deluxe\" Ocean View rooms and therefore cost much more money. What?? Oh yes....and they are not available over the Internet. And Sir, your current room also has a kitchenette (that I didn't need!) so we actually consider your room as an upgrade from your confirmed rate! Boy...do I feel better!! Problem #3 - You can complain all you want, but the Manager is used to these Ocean-View complaints, and does not budge on the interpretation. She offered to move me the next day to another \"ocean-view\" room, facing north, on the north side of their building. The room looked directly into the Capri hotel and had a better glimpse of the ocean, but I passed on the offer, and decided to air my complaints on TripAdvisor...hoping that someone else doesn't run into the disappointment that I did....two nights of sleeping on an old cot-type pullout bed...and enjoying the ocean view from my room for as long as I could stand on my tip-toes! I don't know why people seem to rate this place so high and give it rave reviews. If I was to return to San Diego, I would probably stay next-door at the Capri. Do your own due diligence.
