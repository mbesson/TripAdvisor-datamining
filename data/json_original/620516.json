After 8 days in and around Kuta, Legian and Ubud our family of 6 decided to end our holiday in luxury by booking 2 bungalows (one for the kids and one for us) at La Joya. The surfers in our family were rapt and the rest were looking forward to some RR by the pool. Oh dear! After a bumpy but exciting ride to the property we arrived and were delighed by the beautiful bungalows, some with outdoor bathrooms, complete with thatched roof, terrazzo floors inlaid with shells, teak doors inlaid with mother of pearl and romantic fabric draped beds. Unfortunately for the price, the rooms are a big disappointment. We are OK with no TV or room service but would really have liked a phone to reception, a bar fridge which would have enabled us to enjoy our deck and garden with a cool drink in private without traipsing down to the bar every time. I actually twisted my ankle twice on the uneven stepping stones laid into the grass pathways and this did not even happen to me negotiating the rocky paths at Uluwatu. The airconditioning was good except that the roof did not meet the side of the building so that in some places there was at least 30cm of space for the heat to enter the room and offset any benefit from the aircon.. You really are in the middle of a rural area which is lovely but it means that unless you hire a driver to go out, you eat every meal in the restaurant. The restaurant had a very limited and unoriginal menu with prices that compare to fine dining establishments like Gado Gado, The Breeze and The Living Room. They made excellent cocktails by the pool, but you pay! Our room was in the far corner of the complex and we could not believe it when the local dogs started barking excitedly with every motor bike or vehicle or cow that passed. My partner did not sleep at all the first night and we checked out the next day. What a disaster. To top this off, when we explained that we would be checking out early (11am check out) due to the noise, hot rooms etc the staff turned off the water and power to our 2 rooms at 8.30am!. Thank you very much La Joya!", "Date": "Oct 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR262608905", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "juliezzz"}, {"Content": "La Joya - A romantic getaway We stayed at La Joya for 2 nights during our honeymoon. It was a lovely place to stay. The bungalows are gorgeous. The doors don't lock, but there is a safety deposit box where you can leave any valuables. You also have a deck and a garden area that comes with your bungalow, the area outside is very spacious. The pool is great and the beach is only a short walk away (and a few steps!) The warungs on the beach are good for cheap food. The beach was very quiet when we were there is July. We had very tasty meals at La Joya and would definitely recommend. Although a lot more expensive than eating at the warungs. The breakfast is simple but nice. The staff working around La Joya are very friendly and the staff working in the restaurant aren't quite as friendly as some of the other hotels but pleasant enough. A good place to go for a romantic getaway.", "Date": "Jul 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR406902620", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "LeeAnne19"}, {"Content": "Credit Cards now accepted at La Joya       Villa Day Bed poolside", "Date": "May 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR895921625", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Skippygirl"}, {"Content": "PLEASE put the JOY back in la Joya       bungalow with curved glass doors", "Date": "Sep 4, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR800493731", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "GlobeRoamer"}, {"Content": "Very overpriced I spent a few nights at La Joya in mid-July, just before the height of the tourist season. The bungalows, the pool and the view are nice, but the food, service and payment options are terrible. Out of a possible 10 points for food, the best thing I had was a chicken sandwich that I would give a 6. The rest of the food was terrible, even the scrambled eggs were horrible. As for payment, this place is very isolated, no ATMs nearby, and they only accept cash. What kind of resort doesn't accept credit cards in this day and age? Not only that, the currency coversion rate they give is criminal - over 10% less than the going rate! With La Joya's overpriced rooms (double what they should be) this really adds up. Bali has many great places to stay, but this certainly isn't one of them.", "Date": "Aug 2, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR621275818", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "relleki"}, {"Content": "Many samll rip-offs that add up... Many small ripp-offs, when added up, make a big one. La Joya is a real jewel in many respects, but certainly not money-wise. Everything, from bar and food to Internet or transportation to/from the hotel (a must, since La Joya lays at like ten miles from Jimbaran, the closest city or resort), is from moderately to outrageously out of price. The worst, as mentionned by previous reviewer, is that they don't accept credit cards. Accordingly, when we asked for booking, the owner demanded that we transfer on her bank account in Indonesia 50% of our stay (that is, 200 US dollars) as a deposit. We did so, however, someone made a mess out there in Indonesia and the money never made it to her account. When checking out, she made us pay the full 100% bill. Back home, we had to ask for the money to be retreived to our account. Commissions added to commissions and the whole mess costed us 100, one hundred dollars.", "Date": "Sep 23, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR818588379", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Khawaga"}, {"Content": "A secret spot, peacefull and stunning view on the ocean ...
