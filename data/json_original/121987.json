Based on reviews on Tripadvisor, we chose the Milburn. What a delight across the board! We reserved a standard suite with a king bed, but, although I never confirmed this, I'm pretty sure we got upgraded to a \"premium\" suite (14th floor). It was HUGE - a great living room area, a teeny kitchenette (no need for it to be any larger), and then a long hall that connected back to a large bedroom with windows on EACH side. There were a total of THREE closets in the suite - more than we'd ever need. A few more details: -There were TWO separate thermostats - one in the living room and one in the bedroom - The bathroom was lovely, although quite small, as one might expect in an older hotel. If a person were of wide girth, they'd probably have a lot of difficulty in it. However, tall people would definitely appreciate the height of the shower head. I saw some reviews about the water not getting very warm. We didn't have this problem at all, although the temperature controls were extremely sensitive. The walls are covered in mirrors in the bathroom, so it does not feel confined. There was a phone in there, too :) - The bed was wonderfully comfortable. There was an iPod dock on the bedside table which I didn't use but was a nice touch -Our girls (12 and 9) slept on the sleeper sofa. Seemed like about what you'd expect from a sleeper sofa, but they had no complaints and slept extremely well. -FREE Wi-fi (say no more) - this is NOT a given in NYC -FREE continental breakfast (standard hotel continental breakfast fare, no better, no worse than other places) - this is also NOT a given in NYC -Two flat screen TVs in suite (didn't use them too much - there are better things to do in NYC) -Room was very clean and nicely decorated. VERY tempting just to stay there... -QUIET - I'm sure being on the 14th floor helped, but no issues of street noise -Hotel employees - every single interaction was great, from the nice man from housekeeping who brought us robes to the helpful people at the front desk (one man spent a good 5-10 minutes helping me to identify a great restaurant that I'd forgotten the name of (Celeste - on Amsterdam - yum!) and the super nice guy in the breakfast room. -Lounge - pleasant and cozy with a fire in the fireplace -Location - GREAT This is my new favorite NYC hotel!", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montpelier, VT", "Title": "\u201cConvenient, friendly, affordable hotel\u201d", "Author": "DGP_12", "ReviewID": "UR123020965", "Content": "The Milburn Hotel is in a great neighborhood, is really affordable and has a friendly staff.

The streets around this place are spectacular if you like archiecure like I do and I would recomend just walking around and looking up. Some of the Borwnstones around 81st street were superb but there all over the place if you look.

We turned on the AC in hopes of airing out the rooms, but the two separate AC units were too inadequate to do anything about the strong smell or even simply cool the warm, musty rooms. One large closet next to the bathroom seemed to be the main source of the smell. We informed the front desk of the smell, but we were not given a clear alternative. Against our better judgement because we were so tired, we decided to spend the night. Other problems then became apparent. The shower faucet handles were not secured to the shower wall leaving large gaps where anything could crawl through, and later that night a large bug did appear in the bathroom.

The kitchenette was a life-saver and the free breakfast was excellent. We stayed for 7 nights. In the lobby of the hotel is a nice sitting room with a few bookshelves of books for kids and adults. My 6 year-old would go downstairs every morning to return the books she grabbed the previous day. She loved this part of the day and we were very happy to be able to provide her with lots of reading options without having to pack all her books from home. The front desk also has a small DVD library with a good selection of family-friendly titles available to check out for free. The Milburn's location is fantastic! Just a few blocks down from either the 79th St or 72nd St Metro stops. If you would rather take cabs, the hotel is only half a block from Broadway where you can grab a cab anytime of day within a minute. We were able to go from our room to a Broadway show within 20 minutes! Within just a few blocks in either direction are numerous restaurants, grocery stores, a couple of wine/liquor shops, pharmacies, and anything else you would need.

Big mistake on my part trying to be a good neighbor and booking with them, their rates are not that much less expensive than the Hilton in midtown. I am never recommending this hotel to anyone who comes to visit me, and I have lots of friends internationally and in the US. Management of the hotel just loss 1000s dollars of potential revenue in exchange for 500 dollars cancelation of two rooms I booked with their 72 hours!! cancelation clause. If you're thinking of booking, please look around with the rates, you can get a location closer to midtown attractions.

The representative was very helpful in answering all of my questions about the lay out of the rooms. We arrived early (before 2:00) and our room was ready. The suite was clean, quiet, and spacious! The wi fi was fast enough for our needs (free). We had a few housekeeping needs. We needed more glasses, plates, silverware....they were delivered within the hour.

We arrived early in the day and asked if the front desk representatives if there was any way we could hang up my husband's suit so it would be ready for a formal event that evening. I mentioned that my husband had been traveling for a week and we really needed to assess the condition of his suit. The front desk rep told us to wait until 3 pm for our room. I asked to speak to a manager and was told he was in a meeting. I then pressed the issue and asked for a hanger and a place to store the suit along with the luggage. I was told there was no place to hang a suit for him but then I noticed a coat tree in the area behind the reception desk and asked to use that area. After more discussion, I was given a suit hanger and the suit was hung on a coat tree in the area behind the reception desk. Late that night we tried to use the internet and called the front desk for help. We were told to call another number and were charged $1.25 for the two calls we made to the help desk. Had we known of the charge we would have used our cell phones. We needed to check out a day early, on Friday. Late Tuesday night before reaching the hotel, I called the hotel to let them know of the change of plans. I was told I was too late to avoid a penalty as there is a 72 hour notification time period. When we arrived at the hotel I again asked about the charge for leaving early. On the second attempt to learn more, I was told that if the hotel could sell the room, we would not be charged and that we would know Friday morning whether we had to pay for Friday night. Friday morning no one at the front desk knew anything about our request. We returned after breakfast and a young woman explained that although she did not know the status of the room, we should vacate the room and maybe it would sell. We were not leaving NYC until late that evening, but we packed and left the room as she suggested. When we returned around 4 pm we learned the room had been sold so we did not need to pay for the third night. The room was on the interior courtyard, was quiet, with windows that opened.

The lobby of the hotel is warm and welcoming and the staff are super friendly. We checked in and got directed to our room. The room we booked was a one bedroom suite as there was four of us travelling, the youngest of whom is 19. The room was great. It had a really spacious living room with a big double pull out bed and a flat screen tv with digital and dvd player and all. Off the living room there was a tiny kitchenette, and I mean tiny, but it had a good size fridge and there was a coffee maker and microwave there, plenty for what we needed. The bedroom had two good size double beds with two wardrobes and again a huge flat screen tv with the digital cable and dvd player. It also had an iPod docking station where you could play your iPod or the radio, this came in really handy for charging the iPods we had with us! the bathroom was located off the bedroom, it was small in comparison to what I've come across in Ireland, but no smaller than anything you would see in places like Paris and Barcelona. After reading previous reviews we kind of had a good idea of what to expect of the hotel and the surrounding area. The first night we went to a local diner which served great food, there are plenty of them around the Milburn, and all really good value! The first morning we were a little bit hesitant about the breakfast, we had read that it was one of the downfalls of the hotel. Much to our surprise and delight we found that the breakfast was more than sufficient. There were six different types of bagels, two cereals, juices, teas, coffees, and even a selection of croissants and other breakfast cakes. There really was a good selection, and you could help yourself to as much or as little as you want. One thing I would say is get down to the breakfast early, we found that if it was any later than about 7.45am the queue was really big and you ended up wasting valuable sightseeing/shopping time waiting to get a table. The room isn't huge so space fills up pretty fast. the hotel is located in the perfect area with a good mix of residential houses and shops. There's a Sephora literally across the road at the opposite side of Broadway, it's not as big as some of the others that you will find in NYC but it was still great, and had practically everything there. It was really handy too for just popping in on the way home from anywhere. On our final day the hotel minded our bags for us as we wanted to get a few last minute things done. If you want to use the Subway the nearest stations are on West 72nd and Broadway and West 79th and Central Park West, the 1,2, and 3 routes stop at 72nd street and the local trains stop at 79th. Get a week pass if your there for anything more than 3 days, theyre great and you save loads! Also the Fairview shop nearby is amazing! It has everything you could ever need or want, they even have Barrys Tea and Cadburys chocolate if your feeling any way home sick! Its an amazing place even just to go and have a look in! Nick's Diner is definetly worth a visit....really good value food....place is really cool with loads of messages all over the walls! It's really popular with the locals too which is always a good sign! Another great thing about the hotel is that they have WiFi all over it! It was really handy to be able to go on the internet on my iPod touch from the bedroom to check things like weather and times of buses and Subways! Definetly worth bringing something that can connect to the net! But there are two or three computers with internet access in a room off the lobby as well!

The staff here are not overly friendly, not actually unfriendly, just not as welcoming as you might expect. However, once we were there a couple of days and started chatting with one of them, they turned out to be not too bad after all. The breakfast was very disappointing. Downstairs in the corner room, out of paper cups and bowls. Tiny packets of cereal. Only bagels, no bread. We didn't bother after the first day. Bought breakfast supplies at one of the WONDERFUL supermarkets on Broadway. Fairway or West Side are GREAT. They have everything you could require. For dinner they even have freshly pre-prepared meals for $5-9 which you can take back to your room and eat using the plates etc in the room and the microwave if you need to reheat. I can assure you they are not the frozen TV dinner variety, these are proper meals, good sized and freshly cooked. The cheese counters are to die for! If we had not been travelling with our friends we would have probably eaten in almost every night and tried all the lovely stuff from the supermarkets! Back to the hotel.... it's about a 5 minute walk down to 72nd street where you can get a 2 train non-stop to Times Square (5 mins?) or a 1 which stops all stations (6-7 mins?). On Amsterdam Avenue there are numerous pubs and restaurants. We ate twice at the Amsterdam Ale House. This is straight down 76th street across Broadway and on the corner of Amsterdam. Reasonable priced food. Wine about $9 a glass which from the UK and Aus seems rather expensive.

The line was too long to wait, so we grabbed a bagel and headed for the subway. The next day we did breakfast in our room, and the last day, we waited for a table. If you want to eat in the breakfast room, allow some extra time in the morning. (Although since all rooms have tables in the room- you can easily eat there without a wait.) The employees were great.

We asked the front desk people about parking, and one of them came outside with us to give us advice. Bottom line- we would stay here again, especially with our kids.

I had requested a quiet room and we were very pleased with the room we got. It was on a top floor and was very quiet for Manhattan. We liked having a kitchenette with a sitting area and we also had a private balcony with a nice view. Other positives: The bed was comfortable and we liked the free wireless service and the kitchenette. The room does not have a stove, but you can request a hot plate and pots from Reception. The bathroom needed updating but was just fine with enough room for our toiletaries. The housekeeping service was excellent. The continental breakfast was a perk as was the fitness room. They also offer a free pass to the JCC one block away. And the hotel is located in a wonderful neighborhood, close to great restaurants, cafes, Central Park, and the subway. There were a few things that I did not like about the hotel. The rooms do not have individual thermostats and are heated by radiators. When we first arrived at our room, it was quite cold. I called the Concierge who had me check the unit. It had been turned off and he told me to open the valve to generate heat. The temperature was fine for several hours, but we woke up in the middle of the night because it was sweltering in the room! So we realized that the radiator had been turned off for a reason. We ended up just leaving it off for the rest of our stay, which was fine once we figured that out. The radiator also made periodic hissing and knocking noises -- survivable with ear plugs, but somewhat annoying. Our bed linens had a stain and the blanket had a hole. The refrigerator was not working properly. Even at a low setting, it froze the beautiful salad greens that I had bought at Fairway Market and I had to throw them away. These are minor things, but they started to add up and for the price we were paying, I expected better. My biggest complaint is with the hotel's cancellation policy. The Milburn requires that you cancel by midnight 3 days prior to your arrival date. So if you're arriving on a Wednesday, you need to cancel by the Saturday night before. I reserved online and got a confirmation email. It was not clearly stated that you must cancel by midnight prior to the 72 hour period. I tried to cancel our reservation 3 days prior to arrival but neither the Concierge nor the manager with whom I spoke agreed to cancel the reservation. I left a message with the hotel's general manager and with the accounting office, but nobody ever returned my calls. We decided to keep our reservation to not lose our first night's deposit.

It could end up costing you plenty. My reservation at the Milburn was for Friday, Sept. 18. On Monday, the 14th, I phoned the hotel to inquire about the cancellation policy, which would have been unnecessary had I received a copy of the policy by e-mail or snail-mail. The person I spoke with told me it was three days in advance of the reservation. She also used the phrase \"72 hours,\" which, from my travel experiences, is a synonym for three days. So, because my plans were uncertain at the time, I chose to wait one day based on the conversation, especially since the confused clerk did not tell me that the deadline for canceling was Monday. When I called Tuesday -- three days before I was scheduled to check in -- to cancel because of a family matter, I was informed it was too late. The front-desk clerk I spoke with said to contact the general manager on Wednesday to discuss the situation. I left repeated polite messages with the general manager on Wednesday and Thursday. He refused to return my calls. So I stopped by the hotel Friday morning before leaving town, and the general manager told me the matter had been turned over to accounting and to contact them. For the next eight workdays, I phoned the hotel and asked to be switched to accounting. Each time, I received a recorded voice and was asked to leave a message. Each time, I left a polite recording -- eight of them -- yet never received one return call. It was obvious that the continuous lack of returned calls from the general manager and accounting was an effort by the hotel to ignore me, hoping that I would go away. Finally, I phoned the hotel and requested to be switched to anyone in accounting. I got a live voice who told me a refund or full credit would be considered. My occasional pestering finally got a response after a few weeks. I was informed that no refund or credit would be granted, only that an unspecified \"rate\" might be considered on my next reservation with the hotel. Are you kidding me? So I'm out $339.13, plus hours of my time dealing with the most customer-unfriendly hotel general manager in a lifetime of travel. There are plenty of good hotels in New York.

We booked a suite rather than a regular room after reading the reviews on this site, since only the suites could be guaranteed to be renovated as of the date of our stay. The upcharge was not substantial, and was well worth it. We had no problems at check-in at 6:00 pm on a Friday evening, and the staff was consistently courteous. Our rooms were in the corner on the eighth floor, and it was one of the quietest urban hotel stays I have ever had, despite being in NYC. There was some street noise, but nothing from within the hotel itself. The curtains kept the bedroom very dark, too -- good for late sleepers. Not everything seemed up-to-date -- it is an older hotel -- but for the price we found nothing substantive to complain about. Be advised that our bathroom was very small, with almost no space to set out toiletries, though it was clean and modern. If you have a hanging toiletries bag, or some other method of keeping your things at hand without placing them on a counter or shelf, you might want to bring that along. The kitchenette was also very small, but handy. We both found the king bed as comfortable as at home. Other than price, location was the main reason we chose the Milburn, and it was a good choice. The hotel is located in a pleasant Upper West Side neighborhood, just off Broadway. (But it's still extraordinarily quiet.) Local families were very much in evidence on the streets the weekend we were there. We love to walk, and we walked almost everywhere we wanted to go -- restaurants on two of three nights, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Frick Museum (just across Central Park), Lincoln Center for the opera, and Midtown shopping. On our last night we had dinner in Greenwich Village -- an easy, direct subway ride away. When we did need a cab, it was easy to flag one on Broadway a half-block from the hotel. We thought the complimentary breakfast was going to be a real advantage at the Milburn, but, though it was fine (coffee, tea, juice, cereals, baked goods, some fresh fruit), we think we would probably have been happier breakfasting at the Manhattan Diner a block away. Next time we'll plan on that: they serve breakfast all day. If you're an early riser and like to get a cup of coffee and a bagel first thing in the morning, however, you'll appreciate not having to go out for breakfast.

This hotel is not in the heart and hub bub of downtown so you do actually feel comfortable wandering around at any hour to the 24 hour grocery store around the corner. While being out of the craziness of downtown you are only 1 subway stop (on the 2 train from 72nd street) away from Times Square. You are on the same line (the 1 train from 72nd street) as the ferries to Staten Island and Statue of Liberty, You are a couple of stops from the Museum of Natural History (a must esp the planetarium) on the M79 bus from 79th Street. You can walk to downtown - it took me 20 mins to get to 58th street and you are a couple of long blocks from Central Park. The shopping in the local area is great - a Barneys around the corner, a Loehmans one block down and a Filenes Basement on the cnr of 79th street. The local restaurants are adequate. THE SERVCE: I thought the staff were great. As mentioned our son was ill and they were very helpful with information about Drs etc. The free breakfast is a great bonus and am not sure what the previous reviewers issues were about - you have a choice of cereal, fruit, pastries and bagels, tea, coffee, juice and water.

When I ran back out to explain our situation to the police officer the manager followed me out, and when I was told the ticket could not be retracted, the manager took it off my hands.

We were encouraged by a local friend to stay away from the Times Square/Midtown area to get away from the mayhem and better experience life in a New York neighborhood. I am so glad we stayed in this upper west side location! The room at the Milburn was tiny - this was not a surprise based on everything I read about NYC hotel rooms. We had the studio double - two double beds, a tiny table with two chairs, very small bathroom, and a small kitchenette with microwave, refrigerator, some plates/silverware, and countertop (the kitchenette also had some shelves and ended up being an alternate location for one of our suitcases and belongings). There were four of us - my husband and I, and our two young adult daughters. We did get a pretty good rate through hotels.com (~$137 a night) - expensive for us, but reasonable for New York. If money were no object, we would get two rooms, but..... On the plus side, the beds were very comfortable (I generally have a hard time sleeping in hotels because of the super-hard beds) and had nice linens, delightful pillows. Room was quiet - we did not face out onto the street, but we were near the elevator and did not have a problem. The bathroom had seen better days (heavy on the caulk), but it was clean and worked fine for us. Lots of families at this hotel. They did provide a free continental breakfast - fresh bagels, juice, fruit - but it was often very crowded. Also free wireless internet in the rooms and three computer stations in the lobby for public use. They have a sharing library of books and also videos/video games that can be checked out for free. The front desk staff members were extremely helpful. They greeted us warmly, provided directions and helpful tips, arranged our transportation back to the airport. The only strange thing is that the ice machine and the soda machine are in the basement. The first time I took the elevator down there, I thought it was a mistake - there were housekeeping staff and old mattresses and cleaning supplies everywhere. But there's a tiny room just across from the elevator that houses those items. The neighborhood is wonderful - lots of grocery stores, pharmacies, Filene's Basement and Loehman's nearby, other small specialty shops. Two blocks to the 79th St. subway station - same intersection is where you catch the crosstown bus (M79) that takes you to Central Park and beyond. If you go the other way, you're about 4 blocks from the 72nd St. subway station (there's a Gray's Papaya hot dog place right there that's great). Easy to get to Times Square/Broadway shows. I felt it was very safe. High spots: Manhattan Diner (on Broadway, I think on the corner at 77th?) - wonderful breakfast, get the challah French toast; they also have good desserts. Levain Bakery - just east of the intersection of Amsterdam and 74th - a tiny basement bakery with GIANT warm yummy cookies - the chocolate chip walnut and chocolate peanut butter chip ones were delicious, oatmeal raisin good, too Gray's Papaya (near the 72nd street subway station) - plain grilled hot dogs with mustard and toasted buns. Get the pineapple juice instead of the papaya. Fairway Grocery (corner of 74th and Broadway) - for a Texas girl, this was an amazing glimpse of a \"big\" New York grocery store. Beautiful fresh produce, extensive bakery and deli. I will say that the deli attendant was yelling at a customer for missing her number being called - a bit intimidating - and the checkout process is fast and crammed. You better be ready and on your A game - this is no Wal-Mart! We bought fruit, veggies, bread, and butter to have in the room for snacks. Also, we got good breakfast sandwiches (bagel with eggs, bacon, cheese) and fresh squeezed orange juice at a hole in the wall place on Amsterdam, maybe called Bagel O?

We were pleasantly surprised by our recent stay at the Milburn. We chose the hotel because of the location -- two blocks from relatives -- and were a bit concerned about cleanliness because of a couple of reviews. (Had the option of the Belleclaire and the Lucerne, both for a little less money, but the Belleclaire had some construction going on -- light sleepers -- and the Lucerne was a little farther away than we wanted to be.) We checked in in the morning, before the rooms were ready, but wanted to get the king sized bed, which they wouldn't guarantee over the phone, and wanted to see about getting a quiet room. We were given a really nice sized room on the 12th floor. King bed (simmons beautyrest....excellent), big flat screen tv w/cable, desk with free internet, small kitchen w/fridge, microwave and sink, closet w/safe, and a large CLEAN bathroom that had obviously recently been renovated. Everything was clean, there were tons of pillows, and we were really pleased. Contintental breakfast with cereal, a good variety of bagels, muffins, etc . . . all included in the price. There was a DVD player and a VCR in the room and the hotel has hundreds of movies available, at no charge, at the desk! Lastly, in addition to their own exercise room, swimming is available, for free, at the JCC across the street . . . nice place! Also, they have 24-hour room service with the Manhattan Diner across the street . . . less than 30 minutes for delivery and the prices aren't marked up. Let's just say there was nothing wrong with this stay! The staff were helpful, pleasant, and we were pleased. A few thoughts: Because it's summer, we were running the air conditioner the whole time. Since the air conditioner was running the whole time, we barely heard any noise in the hotel. Our room looked out over the inner block, not the street, so there was no real street noise to speak of anyway, however the hotel does use the doors with electronic keys which means they need to be slammed a bit to close. Also, our room was across the hall from the stairs -- doesn't really matter on the 12th floor -- and also right by the elevator. Without the air conditioner, we might have heard more of the people in the halls and other TVs . . . standard hotel stuff but, perhaps, a bit more evident in an older building? Two standard pet peeves: I'll probably write this in every review but hotel designers should be required to spend one week in every room they remodel! 1. The big flat screen tv was great, however it has a BRIGHT blue power light that stays on when the TV is off. Really bright . . . two towels thick bright, if you know what I mean. 2. The completely remodeled bathroom has no shelves. I don't know why this is so common. There's a toilet, with a back . . . put a small shelf there for stuff. There are wrap-around mirrors but only one hook on the door. EVERY traveler travels with toothbrush, toothpaste, drugs, etc. There should always be a place to put them. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to New York and staying on the Upper West Side.

After reading the reviews on TripAdvisor, I booked a reservation and have absolutely no regrets. We stayed there for six nights from Dec. 16-Dec. 21, 2008. Our room was plenty big with a tiny kitchenette. The children had a sofabed and my husband and I had a wonderful separate bedroom with a king size bed. There was a bath that had two entrances, one from the living area and one from the bedroom. The counter space in the bathroom is very minimal but there is storage space so you can put your things away when not in use. Besides having the sofabed in the living area, there was also a small dining table. The kitchenette was very small but served the purpose. There is a wonderful market just one block over, Fairway Market, and on a few occasions we bought food items and we were able to eat in the room. The building itself is very charming as it is a converted pre-war apartment building. The staff was helpful, too. We arrived at the hotel on the first night at 2:00 AM and they already had the sofabed made out for our children. The mattress in the bedroom was absolutely heavenly; I slept very soundly each night. The location is wonderful as there is a subway station four blocks one direction and three blocks in the opposite direction. I felt perfectly safe walking to the market alone or with my children. It is a very residential area and it was a treat just enjoying the beauty of all the different old era buildings in the neighborhood. There are several family-run shops as well as chain stores, such as The Children's Place and Gymboree. Getting to the theater district/Times Square on the subway was very easy and took less than 15 minutes.

For a light lunch, the famous Zabar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is a 5-minute walk away, and at the corner of the hotel (2-minute walk) is Nick\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, a no-nonsense pizza and burger joint that serves huge burgers and breakfast meals at very reasonable prices.

The Fairways Caf\u00c3\u00a9 also serves up good meals, and for the best bagels in Manhattan, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s H&H, also a 5-minute walk from the hotel.

Broadway and all other sites are as easily accessible from the hotel. Take Bus 104 at the corner bus stop (76h and Broadway), and this takes you directly to Columbus Circle/Central Park, the Broadway Theatre District and Times Square. To and from the airport we took a Dial 777 sedan, which is about the same price as a cab. If you book online for the trip to the hotel, you get a $3 voucher which you can use for the return trip.

The lobby, public restroom, computer room, and sitting room are nicely updated. I wished they had updated our room the same way! We had a studio, comfortably firm king bed, then ordered a cot to be delivered. The room was small but manageable. The bathroom consisted of a sink and tiny counter space opposite a toilet and shower/tub. There was also a wall phone that I kept knocking with my arm. The baseboards had come off in some spots revealing some ugly spots underneath. I didn't dare open the crooked doors under the bathroom sink. I didn't want to see what was in there (it could've been fine--I don't know). I showered with the door open because it felt so claustrophobic with the door shut. A small refrigerator, sink, and coffeemaker were squeezed in on the opposite side of the bathroom. The maids do not wash dishes as part of their contract. The rooms were cleaned daily and they did a good job. The amount of shampoos/conditioners/lotions they give you is stingy. Unless you ask, they give you one sliver of a soap for the sink AND bath. No shower cap unless you ask, too. The A/C was very loud the whole time. The low-med-high setting controls didn't seem to make a difference although it did keep the temperature cool in the room. I had a hard time sleeping with the A/C on at first but after the second night, I got used to the noise. The front desk staff said the A/C was brand new. That was probably true;' they just didn't mention it was the lowest-end model of the newest A/Cs available. The staff offered to change our room but we decided it was bearable. The hotel gives free wi-fi both in the room and in the lobby. They give you a passcode for thirty minutes of websurfing in the lobby. I don't know if you can get another ticket if you wanted to surf beyond that. We found we didn't need more than that. The hotel offers free use of a brand new pool a few blocks away--this turned out great for our daughter who was tired of traveling. They require a swim cap though; luckily, they had some spares so we didn't have to buy one. The hotel also offers free use of DVDs and videotapes-also good for down time of the kids. The continental breakfast downstairs is offered Mon-Thurs. It's ok--nothing fancy but enough to get you started in the morning. Room service food comes delivered from another restaurant in a brown bag. It was nicely wrapped up in foil on the inside but didn't come on a done-up tray like my daughter had hoped. A washer/dryer are in the basement--I didn't see it but I heard it was pretty spooky down there. It takes something like $4 in quarters to wash. The front desk didn't have any quarters. We decided to take our laundry next door, which they washed/dried/folded for $1/lb. It was in by 9am, out by 5pm. Well worth it. The hotel is located on the upper west side, just three blocks from the subway. The shops and delis give this area a residential feel, away from the busy tourist areas, yet close to museums and Central Park. After the U.S. Open, we walked home from the subway at 2am but didn't feel unsafe at all. Employees were cleaning their shops and sweeping the streets and other folks were walking to their destinations. I'm not used to paying about $200+ for a room but in NYC, this is considered to be on the low end.

My wife attempted to cancel the reservation online at 12:30 on the 22nd and the website rejected it.

We constantly used our fridge and microwave in the kitchenette. When we would bring food or snacks back to the room, we would actually use the microwave as storage and to heat up the leftovers we always seemed to have.

The connection is a bit slow, but good enough for anyone's needs. The in-room safe is big enough for passports, money and some other small things. Laptops will not fit in there, but you can get a lot of other things in there! You have to keep in mind that this hotel is definitely older and has some quirks. The main one being the slower elevators. We were on the 9th floor and just before we were ready to go, one of us would go and hit the button on the elevator. The floors aren't that big, so it was easily accessible. Other than that, some of the fixtures are older and a bit dated....but they work! There are no ice or drink machines on each floor either. I think you have to go to the basement to find these, but we just stocked our fridge so we always had cold drinks in the room. They have a really nice continental breakfast downstairs from Mon-Thurs.

The higher up you are, the less inclined you would be take the stairs! ~ The rooms have steam heat, and it can be a bit of a challenge to regulate. However, if you call the front desk, they will send someone from maintenance up very promptly to adjust it for you. My room was boiling hot when I got in. Maintenance turned it down as low as it would go, and I still managed room temperature by having the window open most of the time I was in the room. ~ The phone system is old and doesn't work very well...at least it didn't in my room. The few times I made phone calls, I could hear other conversations in the background. I loved the location on the UWS. You are close to a subway station that will get you pretty well anywhere you want to go, and very near to many great restaurants, shops, and grocery stores, yet the side streets are residential and pretty quiet. It's an easy walk to both Central Park and Riverside Park. It's an older hotel, but very well kept. For the price, I would definitely stay at the Milburn again.

The Milburn, with its new/old fittings, is giving itself the new image of a European boutique hotel, complete with hotel staff who screen phone calls for those important enough for the manager (yes, I was actually told that).

I'm not writing to state that the location of the hotel has changed, nor have the rooms suddenly become ill-kept, but there are moments, exchanges with hotel staff, that travelers recognize as the signals that the warmth and professionalism that previously defined the hotel has been superseded by the cold and impersonal.

Even so, I can't stand tripping over things and like to have a spacious room, and the Milburn definitely fit the bill. We paid about $310/night, which was pretty much the going rate for hotels of this calibre in NYC in September, one of the busiest months. We had a king suite, and both rooms were very spacious. There were phones and TVs in both rooms, and a phone in the bathroom. As others have noted here, the bathroom was tiny, but I'd rather have a small bathroom than a small living space! The hotel was a bit shabby but it was clean, as was the room. Staff were helpful and friendly, although being as self-sufficient as we are, we had little interaction. Bed was comfortable, air conditioner wasn't TOO noisy, very little noise heard from other rooms. We LOVED the surrounding neighbourhood. Although we went out for a couple of expensive dinners, we didn't want to spend much time sitting in restaurants waiting to be served, so shopped at neighbourhood grocery stores and had our breakfasts and some dinners in our room, The kitchenette was tiny but quite functional. We really liked that when we were out walking, we were in the midst of folks walking their dogs, walking their kids to school, and so on. Proximity to Central Park was great, ditto the subway.

We were part of a group tour, but decided to go a couple of days early. We didn't want to pay the going rate for our group's Midtown hotel, so we decided on the Milburn, and we were very pleased. First, though, the negative: there was a mix-up in our reservations. We had booked on-line throught the hotel's web site in early December 2006. I had occasionally checked the reservation to make sure it was OK. When we arrived, they couldn't find my name at first. Finally, they said we were supposed to arrive in July, one month later. Fortunately, I had brought the email confirmation with me, and after the manager looked everything over, we were given a room that was an upgrade from what we had reserved. So the problem was resolved to our complete satisfaction. Now the good stuff. The lobby is very inviting, with a nice area for seating and relaxing. Our room (a one bedroom suite with a King) was very clean with all the amenities we needed. There were no problems with the AC. The bed may have been the most comfortable bed we had ever slept in. The bathroom is indeed small, but for us that is not a big deal. The Milburn provides as a courtesy what other hotels charge for: use of a computer with internet access and holding luggage in storage are 2 examples. The hotel's location on the Upper West Side is very convenient to subway stops and the neighborhood seems, by NY standards, fairly unhurried and neighborly. There are several restaurants nearby that give discounts or special offers to guests of the Milburn. The hotel staff is very helpful, and recommended a nice restaurant when we asked. Taxis don't often go in front of the hotel, so to get a cab plan to go to Broadway. The Milburn is a great hotel for those staying in NY who don't to spend a great deal of money on a hotel.

There were 3 of us in the room and the total cost, inc. tax, etc. was $818.00 (US) for three nights. We had 2 double beds and a couch that pulled out to make another bed (We didn't use that). There was also a single chair. The room was much bigger than any I have seen in the candid photos. We needed a handicapped accessible room b/c my daughter is in a wheelchair and she was able to move around quite freely and not bump into things! There was a small, but very clean bathroom and also a small, but again clean, kitchen area. Not once did I see any housekeeping staff walking through the halls!! Yet, when we returned from being out all day the room was made up. The staff was very friendly and when we called to ask for extra towels they came right up with them. My only complaint would be that there needs to be a longer loading area. Going in was a breeze, but that was a Sunday. Going out there was a huge truck loading mattresses on and it blocked part of the loading space, and that was in addition to cars going by and one car double-parked waiting for someone--but that's New York!! There is a small fitness center and there is access to a pool nearby (We used neither!!). They are now building a breakfast area off the lobby, but until that is finished there are no restaurants on the property. We went to a bagel place 2 blocks up which our daughter recommended and right across the street there is a 24 hour place called Big Nick's. It is a little hole in the wall, but quite good, and always crowded! Oh, and we had a celebrity sighting the day we arrived. There was a car in front of ours and the man was putting something in the car and it was Richard Kind (from Spin City). We ran into him several times that day walking around.

The air conditioner is a windowbox so all the dust from their work blew directly into our room. We asked to move but were not accommodated.

Easter was very warm, so we ended up spending a lot of time in Central Park which was just a short walk away from the hotel. 72th Street subway station was also very close and so was West Side Market (we liked it better than Fairway since Fairway was always so crowded). I would stay at The Milburn again. But I have to admit that if I had more money to spend I would go to some place much fancier...

Lincoln Center, Central Park within walking distance, and subway station is only a couple of blocks away. Crosstown buses are also a couple of blocks away, useful if you're going over to the Museum Mile.

While you aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as close to all the attractions the subway is only a short walk away and since its so close to Broadway we never had a problem hailing a cab. The main reason that the location was so great is that Upper West Side isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really a tourist area. So instead of all the shops being tourist orientated (i.e. full of postcards and other souvenirs) you get some great businesses nearby. In particular there are a couple of great supermarket/delis nearby where we often grabbed something for dinner \u00e2\u20ac\u201c heating it up in the microwave in the hotel suite. The staff were also helpful and friendly. Sometimes however it can be difficult to get them to understand what you want.

Main thing is a place to stay, a good bed, decent shower,and good location. Well...guess what...The Milburn delivers on all fronts. Upper West side is just 10 minutes away from Time Square, with the 1 or 2. Subway is 4 blocks away (5 minute walk) on 72th street. Breakfast is available at Manhattan Diner, just across the street, $15 for 2 persons! Dinner is okay at Niko's, also across the street. Already mentionned in other reviews is Fairway market, large selection of fresh products; vegetables, meat,bread,take-away dinners. We paid $215 a night, which I think is a steal, this timemof year, and considering the neighbourhood.
