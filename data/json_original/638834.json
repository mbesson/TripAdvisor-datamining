On discovering that there were only three teabags (one Indian/British style, one Peppermint and one Fruit) I asked reception for more 'traditional' teabags, and was given a handful of extra bags. However, when the room was cleaned during the day, and the stock replenished, I was amused to discover that the extra teabags had been taken away and we were once again left with just three (one of each)!!

All I can say is that the rooms in this hotel are so big and comfortable, it doesnt matter what kind of room you get. I wouldnt consider staying anywhere else in Berlin. In the past I have stayed in various Berlin hotels including the Kempinski on Ku'damm, the Artotel and Centrovital in Spandau, but this hotel is the best. Firstly as a business class hotel you get a level of attention you wouldnt get elsewhere. Check in is so quick and efficient, reception staff are so helpful. Room service is fantastic and the household staff are friendly and welcoming. The rooms are surprisingly big, spacious and comfortable (order harder pillows though if necessary - traditionally in Europe pillows are soft). The furnishings and decoration are modern, clean and well maintained. Plenty of storage in the large wardrobe for cases etc. Great sized bathroom with a fantastic shower, showergels etc. And English TV! Always a plus. Breakfast is expensive but there are plenty of great restaurants and cafes nearby for food. Cafe Einstein being my favourite. The bar serves lovely food (Berlin Burger highly recommended!) and cocktails. Nice and atmospheric in the evening after a long day shopping at the Christmas Markets : ) As its a business hotel, conferences are held in the conference room across from the bar. But this isnt a problem. It seems the conferences finish early evening leaving guests of the hotel free to lounge in the bar. The location is perfect. The bus 100 is right outside the hotel and goes directly from the Zoo to Alexanderplatz. The tour buses also stop here! Witttenburg Platz and Nollendorfplatz U bahn are a short stroll away. KaDeWe is about a five minute walk. Its ideally located in the centre and so easy to get to and from the hotel. There is also a taxi rank across the road from the hotel. The current renovations had no impact on our stay whatsoever, and I believe they will be finished in March 2012. I am staying here again in January 2012 for our 6th visit to Berlin and will hopefully get to see the new rooms on our 7th visit sometime in the near future!", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Doha, Qatar", "Title": "\u201cGood value and spacious room\u201d", "Author": "topcat1972", "ReviewID": "UR121850548", "Content": "We visited Berlin as part of our honeymoon and we were not disappointed.

It is a large hotel well located a 10 minute walk from the zoo. The hotel itself is modern, clean and spacious. one tip I would give you is not to use the phone to call home. a 12 minute call to Scotland cost me 15.60 euros, far better off calling from a phone box!!!! getting to the hotel. we came from schoenfield airport . we bought the ABC welcome card at the airport, but you could have got it at the train station from one of the red machines. please please follow this advice though!!! only stamp/validate the ticket ( in the wee red boxes on the platform) once just on your first journey. you don't need to stamp it again for any further journeys. we did and got thrown off the train coming back from a day trip and charged a 40 euro fine because we thought we had to stamp it every journey. on arriving at the station we followed the advice from other reviewers but could not find the express train mentioned. So we ended up going to platform three and getting the train to Dessau. We got off at zoo and then we were lost!!! if you want to walk to the hotel when you come out of the station and you can see the zoo in front of you turn right and just and walk to the top of the street. then turn left and keep walking straight down that road. or when you get to infront of the zoo ( you will see the elephant gate) cross the road and get on the number 100. this is a great bus service and stops at all the main sites such as the Reichstag, Brandenburg gate etc but even better than that it stops at Lutoplatz just in front of the hotel. the next stop comes up on the display well in advance, just remember to press the stop button!! in the end we ended up getting a taxi to the hotel which cost 5 euro 60 cents. Even although we had paid in full in advance (and so didn't bring our credit card) we were charged a deposit of 50 euros per night which would be returned to us upon checkout. This is something you really need to know if you are a traveller on a budget like we were and have booked and paid in full in advance. we stayed on the 5th floor. There was very little noise. The rooms were clean and spacious and decorated in a modern style. The mattresses were very squishy yet comfortable. you only get one large rather squishy square shaped pillow, we didn't ask for more but I assume you could have. We has a safe in our room which we could programme which was free of charge and the TV has a number of English speaking channels, BBC, ITV etc which are also complimentary. best of all was the wee fridge in the room. it enabled us to nip across to netto just up the street and buy some breakfast essentials as we didn't opt for breakfast at the hotel. Diet coke aka coke light is very expensive in Berlin! I got one from the kiosk at hotel reception and was charged 3 euros for the pleasure. However This was actually comparable in cost to plenty of other shops we saw in Berlin, even bottled water was on the expensive side compared to other countries in Europe I have visited. we nearly died one night when we went to the Irish bar and got charged 13 euros 20 for 1 bulmers and 1 gin and bitter lemon!!! it was quite hot and humid when we were there and doing a lot of walking about cold drinks were needed regularly! The customer service team were great at the hotel and nothing was a problem for them. The receptionists spoke English and were helpful giving us a map to help us get around. when we left to get back to the airport we got the bus from the stop on the square outside the front entrance no. 100 bus to freidrichstrasse and then we went to that station and caught the airport express from platform one. May I strongly recommend to anyone travelling to Berlin for a few days to visit Sachsenhausen in the town of oranienberg. It was something I felt I simply had to see. we took the number 100 bus to friedrichstrasse. got off walked up the street to friedrichstrasse station and got the s1 s-bahn train to oranienberg. then we did the 20 minute walk ( well signposted- or you can get the bus) to Sachsenhausen. you will need to leave I.D as a deposit for an audioguide (3 euros) and a map (0.50 cents) but you get this back when leaving. Also you have to make a reservation to visit the pergammon museum which I was disapointed by as I the didn't get to see it. Reichstag too has to be booked three days in advance. Berlin was a great city to visit and we happened to be there for the 50th anniversary commemoration of the building of the wall.

When we arrived at the hotel at about 11:00 (after a sleepless night) we recieved a room (1516) that was suposed to be as we booked, double bed none-smoking. We were notofied that we got a 2 levels upgarade from classic to business room. BUT when we entered the room we discovered a twin bed. I went down to the front desk and the lady said that this is what they have at the moment and if we like she will move us to another room (1526) with a king-size double bed. She pronissed that House keeping will attend to it immidiatly, but it will take some time to clean. We went out for almost 3 hours. We came back at 14:30 BUT the room was not ready for us. We waited 20 monutes more got the key went into the room BUT it was a twin bed, once again. It was too much for us and after a while the lady in the front desk said that any booking is just a guest wish BUT they do not promise to fulfil it. I thanked her for giving us a room and not a sleeping bag in the garage and decided I'm not going to fight it any more. I didn't want to destroy my entier vacation for being mad at an idiot at reception. The room shot have been a high level (businees at a 4 star hotel) BUT the room amenties were limited to empty fidge that used to be a mini-bar, safe, TV, Air-conditioner, coffe making corner, and two soap dispencers in the bath room (they calim shampoo and soap is the same). BUT no shower cap, no shampoo, no hair conditionaer. They provide 4 towels (hands and shower) BUT the two larger ones are significantly smaller than what I know from many other hotels.

My partner and I had a pleasant stay there and would be happy to return again someday. Location: The location is very good. It is situated about a 5-10 minute walk from the U Bahn and there are local bus services nearby. There are shops and restaurants within a short walking distance. The area feels safe when walking around at night. Staff: Professional, approachable and happy to help with any requests. Every staff member we dealt with was able to speak English. Room: I paid for a classic room but was given a superior room which was nice. The bed was comfortable but the pillows were too soft for my liking. We had a double bed but single duvets but it was fine that way. There was a TV, small refrigerator, 2 bedside tables, a phone, 2 chairs, a small table, a large mirrored wardrobe with coat hangers, shelves and a safe inside. It had carpeted flooring. The room was a good size and was well decorated. Inside the information booklet in the room it mentions complimentary internet for use in rooms and this was the case sometimes but other times we attempted to log on and it was asking we pay 15.95. So sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. We didn't require it very much to query it but I'm not sure what was going on with the Internet. Bathroom: The bathroom had tiled walls and floors with a bath/shower, a sink and a toilet. There is a large wall mirror and an attached magnifying mirror on the wall. There was a hairdryer in the bathroom and shaving sockets. The hotel provides a bottle of shampoo/soap/body wash combo on the wall in the shower and at the sink. Two hand towels and two bath towels were provided. The bathroom was very clean and the water was always hot when required with good water pressure in the shower. Restaurant: We did not use the hotel restaurant for breakfast or dinner. To be fair, I think asking for 21 euro per person is excessive, it doesn't matter how big and varied the breakfast is said to be; one can only eat so much in the morning! We couldn't justify 42 euro per day for our breakfast and instead it is possible to store milk in the refrigerator for cereal bought from a nearby store or visit a nearby cafe or pick up a pastry for 1 euro in the U Bahn station before heading out for the day. Similarly, the restaurant seemed expensive and this was off putting. In saying that, the restaurant menu did look nice and if you can afford it then feel free to ignore this bit. However, I would recommend the hotel bar meals which are slightly cheaper if you don't feel like leaving the hotel for dinner. Bar: The hotel bar serves drinks, meals and snacks. The staff were friendly. They have a good cocktail menu. Drinks are a little expensive but being a hotel bar that's probably to be expected. The bar was a nice place to sit for the evening when it was pouring with rain outside. When it is sunny there is an outdoor area which is nice to sit in when having a drink.

The famous 100 bus stops less than a 1 minute walk from the hotel too. Public transport to every corner of Berlin is very easily reached from the hotel.

The bus is really easy to use, since there is a little flashing board which tells you which station is coming up, and it is also announced.

Also if anyone is going for a weekend in November or December, you can buy a single ticket which will work all day on the transport system. No need for a travel card. Also, don't forget to validate tickets as there are plain clothed police officers around. So back to the hotel - breakfast was a large selection which was nice. The staff at Breakfast were a bit abrupt but I think that's just their way. Big buffet selection, you can have your eggs freshly made. There were cereals, breads, continental meats, cakes, cooked breakfast, fruits, yogurts, all different coffees and teas (e.g. lattes, hot chocolate etc). Maid service was good too.

If you dont mind a walk it wasnt far to walk from the hotel to brandenburg gate etc, that took about half an hour through the Tiergarten. There is a few restuarants around the area, a Steak restuarant and an Italian, which are withing about 10mins walk. Not that many bars though. Our room was at the back of the hotel looking over the car park so wasnt too noisy. The Room: We had a double standard room, it was very spacious with a sofa, table and 2 chairs, there was a nice bathroom and the shower was powerful. There was also a small fridge (we kept beer and orange juice in it), and a nice flatscreen TV - my only complaint would be that only ITV was working out of the UK channels, not BBC1 and BBC2, even though they show on there. The rooms were tidied daily and the coffee restocked. Overall I liked the location of the hotel even though it isnt in the most lively location - if you want to be in the midst of all the nightlife then this hotel probably isnt for you - but this wasnt a problem due to the transport links near the hotel, which were very good.

We had a bunch of bags since we were working for 1 week and vacationing for a week and a half afterward. The beds were two twin beds pushed together. Again, I expected this but the beds kept splitting apart. Finally, I was with a group that got free breakfast. I registered through a different system but was with the same group that rented hundreds of rooms for a week. When I asked about possibly having them remove my breakfast charges given that I was with the group, they said no. I understand I registered through a different system, but clearly it wouldnt have been a big deal since they were letting people in free all week just for wearing the company shirt or being with someone wearing a company shirt. I do want to note that the breakfast was great. Not sure it was worth 19 Euros, but it may have been :) If this were 100E a night and included breakfast, then it would be worth it. Otherwise, I'd recommend staying closer to the Zoologicher Garten as that was a very central location.", "Date": "November 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Medell\u00edn, Colombia", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel, the worst Internet Connection!\u201d", "Author": "ColombiaJuanSe", "ReviewID": "UR48935893", "Content": "This hotel is really good overall!

Hotel Berlin is situated in an easily accessible area about one-third the bus journey to/ from Bahnhof Zoologischer/Alexanderplatz.

I was allocated an upper floor room overlooking that area\u2019, which provided lots of day light, most needed in February. The room was large and well decorated with a lounge area plus a \u2018huge\u2019 closet, minibar and the usual 4-star hotel inclusions. My dinner in the hotel for the first two nights was excellent and a very personable maitre\u2018d assisted me re wine selection. The buffet breakfast (incl. in the room rate) was \u201cstunning\u201d and consisted of a wide range of juices, cereals, fruits, breads, cold selections (meats and cheeses) as well as hot, i.e. scrambled egg, bacon, tomatoes, etc. The selection of \u2018anything and everything\u2019 was amazing. I loved every \u2018mouth-watering\u2019 moment! My last night at Hotel Berlin, I ate at an Italian Restaurant, \u201cSorriso Ristorante\u201d, close by the hotel at 76 Kurfurstenstrasse, which was perfect and made even more so by a delightful waiter.

We ate in the restaurant once, and the food was really good. I had a steak, cooked to my exact specification. The restaurant price was a bit steep though. The restaurant manageress was really nice, and took good care of us. The location for us was good too. We meant to do some walking, and I completed an ambition, to walk through Tiergarten, down Strasse des 17 Juni and on to the Brandenburg Gate and on to Unter den Linden, taking in the Russian Memorial and the Reichstag. There were some nice restaurants local to the hotel. Just round the corner, there is a lovely Italian restaurant, and I swear I bumped into Gerhard Shroeder in there. He does live in Berlin I'm told. There was a good chinese nearby too. The U-Bahn was only five minutes from the hotel. If you go to Berlin, then get yourself a 72 hour pass for the transport network. You can use the U-Bahn, S-Bahn and buses for 72 hours once you have validated the ticket. I think there are two levels, one for the city centre and one that takes in all of Berlin and Potsdam too. Potsdam definetly worth a visit. If you fly into Sch\u00f6nefeld, the taxi into Berlin can be expensive. The train is much cheaper and very easy to use. The train does a big curved route through parts of the old East Germany. It was an interesting trip. The main stop is Alexanderplatz. Once in Berlin centre, you can easily get an U-Bahn close to most places or just get a local taxi. We visited Charlottenberg Palace, near Spandau. It's a piece of renovation, but really well done. All the artefacts have been gathered from other palaces that were destroyed beyond renovation in 1945. In early December, they have a good Christmas Market outside the main gates.

With the exception a swimming pool, the hotel offers all the amenities one would expect for such a large modern hotel. The standard rooms were HUGE not just by European standards, but by any standard. The classic double included two twin beds moved together to form a queen size space (typical practice in Germany) with new higher end linens, nights stands, separate sitting area with full sofa, coffee table, and sitting chairs, a desk and chair, small flat panel TV with BBC and CNN available, and FREE WiFi throughout the hotel (a rare and valuable amenity in large business class hotels). A very large closet with wide full length mirrored doors was opposite the ample size full bath. The front desk was staffed by friendly, always helpful professionals all of whom spoke flawless English (other language-speaking staff were also available) and adjacent to the front desk was a 24 hour \"grab and go\" snack cooler with tasty sandwiches, chicken wraps, and beverages available for purchase at a fair price 24 hours a day. The oversized lobbies included a bar which also offered food most of the day. A full restaurant serving food at three mealtimes is also available. (I only ate breakfast there once and will comment on that later, so I cannot evaluate the quality or value of other meals.) An impressive (for a hotel) modern gym was available 24x7 free of charge for guests in the lower level. Also in the lower level was an outoor/indoor relaxation lounge with its own tranquility waterfall, and two dry saunas which were operational from about 6 to 10PM and during other hours by request. Local phone calls were fairly priced at about 0.8 Euros. The location was perfect for me as I like to walk and be central to everything but not right in the middle of anything. In 15-20 minutes I could walk to the heart of the K'damm, the middle of Tiergarten, the zoo and aquarium, and the Shoneberg nightlife - in perhaps 20-30 minutes be at the Reichstag and Brandenberg gate. U-bahn and S-bahn stations are a good 10-15 minute walk. That said, those who want to have a plethora of restaurant choices and tourist attractions just outside the door might be disappointed in what I have read elsewhere has been described as a rather \"bland\" location. My ONLY criticism of the hotel and my stay there is the very expensive price (19 Euros / $28 USD) for the breakfast buffet. Yes, it was plentiful and presented a variety of hot and cold selections, but the level of pricing is more appropriate for a full scale Sunday brunch, not a breakfast. Fortunately, there are other choices nearby. (E.g., the nearby Holiday Inn Express even advertises outside its door \"Paying too much for breakfast at your hotel? Enjoy ours for 7.95 Euros.\" Granted it offered only a simple cold buffet, but for 11 Euros difference, it was fine. Simple coffee, juice, and bread breakfasts were available elsewhere nearby for about 4 to 5 Euros. This hotel is a GREAT VALUE if you can get a room at a good rate $90 USD or less, and a little more if breakfast is include, and a fair value in the $100-$120 range. Once the rooms sell for over $130 you probably can find better values elsewhere.

The hotel is large with nicely decorated public areas and helpful staff. The hotel bar is a great meeting place but not cheap. The walk to the underground is direct and takes around 10 minutes but the whole of Berlin is then at your disposal. The staff at reception recommended a nearby restaurant for our last evening and it was a fantastic find. There's a fab cocktail bar (Bar am Lutzowplatz?) across the square from the hotel and they do a half price offer most nights - well worth a visit! Our room was in the main wing and while it was huge, it wasn't particularly modern. We had a great sitting area and the room was cosy throughout our stay even though the temperatures outside were well below freezing. Bathroom was nice, view was a concrete block but in all the room met all our requirements. One of our party stayed in the new wing and they had a modernised room with flat screen tv and much more modern furnishings.

There is however a quick-breakfast option available at the bar (a croissant and coffee). A good option is to eat in the restaurant at KaDeWe (department store), open from 10am weekdays and 9.30 on Saturday. We found the immediate area to be somewhat lacking in restaurants/bars. Although we didn't encounter any problems, the surrounding streets appeared to be frequented by 'working girls' at night! The public transport in Berlin is excellent and as most places are a short tube ride away. Walking to Brandenburg Gate via the Tiergarten took perhaps 35 minutes. This would be a good base for a shopping trip, as well as for sightseeing. There are more centrally located hotels, but the prices rise accordingly. Tip - get a 'Welcome Card'.

Later in our stay, there was always a wait at reception. Other problems: the air conditioning has an automatic shutoff, and only one setting--on or off. So at night, you have to get up and turn it on again every few hours. The water in the shower can go from hot to cold in a split second, and never stays the same temperature for very long. The fitness center consists of: a treadmill, a stationery bicycle, some dumbbells and a second rate universal gym. And the restaurant was spotty. The main course was a lowlight (overcooked fish), the desserts were excellent. Another problem was the location. It sounds great: the middle of Berlin. But to quote Gertrude Stein, there's no there there. There are low rise office buildings, but no shops or restaurants in the immediate vicinity. Lutzowplatz, the square the hotel borders on is overgrown with weeds. There are some nice stores and cafes past the subway station, about five blocks away.
