With several friends staying at the resort we were invited to to enjoy the pool at the resort, knowing the hotel's policy is 5 wrist bands per room. Our friends gave us wrist bands and myself and my 3 sons (ages 11,.8,7) were having the time of our lives on the Saturday before Easter Sunday with 5 other families, 2 of which were hotel guests. I ordered a hot dog for my son and we both took bites out of it - it was beyond hot - scolding- we both burnt our tongues, my son was crying and the hotdog was gross so I complained and told the attendant at the snack shack to be careful with other guests eating the dog is was too hot. He called his manager and he refunded my money. We went back to our seats and all of sudden the manager, who refunded my money, and a security guard came over to where we were sitting, approaching me so agressively, it was shocking. He said, you were asked to leave once and you are treaspassing you need to leave the property immediately. I respnded by saying I was not asked to leave, which I was not the security guard said this is not up for discussion, so I said I need to find my 3 sons and got up. Ofcourse I couldn't find them they were swimming and having a ball, I walked around the property looking for them, my heart ponding. While I did that my friends tried to talk to the security guard to find out my they were kicking me out and he said he didn't know what happened but was just doing his job, they said you have the wrong person, she has done nothing but laying here getting sun and swimming, other guests sitting beside us tried to get involved and they said the PD would be called if I didn't leave the property. I finally found my kids and packed up and me and my 3 girlfriends and our 7 boys were escorted off the property all the way to the valet. How embarrassing, can you imagine. I am a single mom, a professional woman, a clasy and sophisticated person, I was enjoying my Easter weekend in Scottsdale, from California. I was sober and respectable and did not derserve to be treated this way. There was absolutely no reason to have escorted me out of this resort and in the insulting manner I was treated. This was honestly the most devasting experience of my life and ruined my children's vacation. They were embarrassed and confused. I am also a frequent Marriott client and can not believe they treat people like this. There was no discusson or empathy, they didn't pull me aside and explain anything or try to work with me. They treated me like a common criminal that had committed the worst of crimes. Beware if you are at this property you may get kicked out and be humiliated for no reason what so ever. I ahve travelled all over the world stayed in the most exclusive resorts and never in my life have I been asked to leave or treated in this way. I will never ever stay at a Marriott again.

It was spring break and the kids were really hard to avoid, even late in the evening in the steakhouse. It seems like a great family resort if that is what you are looking for. My husband and I don't have kids and probably would not return to the resort for that reason. We did find the spa pool and that was an amazing quiet oasis from the noise of the rest of the outdoor spaces. You can either pay for a day pass or it is included if you are an elite marriott member. I had a hot stone massage while I was there with Stephan and it was amazing! The spa facilities are relaxing and very nice. That was definitely worth the splurge. There is a happy hour from 4-6 at Roy's and the drinks, appetizers, and staff were all great. Everything is $6 and you can sit out on the patio and enjoy.

Even the Priceline-level room I got was pretty phenomenal, with a big balcony, comfortable loveseat, and fantastic work chair -- I wanted to go home and buy that same chair. Fantastic bed, too. The highlight of this resort was pretty clearly the pool, which seemed to stretch on forever. The lazy river actually had enough square footage to be lazy. Inner tubes were free and plentiful, and there was a bar and taco stand within feet of the pool entrance. All the poolside areas were immaculate and functional, even down to the restaurants situated just outside of the pool/lake area. Service here was inconsistent. Check-in was a breeze, a late checkout wasn't a problem, and it was never an issue getting somebody on the phone from the front desk, even at busy times. With such a sprawling resort, though, I'd run into situations where one hand wasn't really talking to the other. The girl at the front desk, as an example, told me that the steakhouse on site was open till 10 PM. I decided to go there for dinner after dropping off my bags. When I asked for directions to get there at 9:30 (the hotel is big enough to require such directions), I was given functional directions only to arrive and find that the steakhouse had closed at nine. It seems like somebody could have filled me in there. I ended up heading back to the water's edge to grab dinner at the bar area, and while the service was great when someone actually showed up, it took a full 25 minutes from when I sat down to the moment where someone even came by for a drink order. The area was a little crowded, but not 25-minutes-bad. Oh, and the resort fee. $25 per day is a little nuts, even if it gets you access to the gym and free (very functional) internet. This should really be $15/night and it should cut out some of the useless accoutrements (e.g. free appetizer at the steakhouse with an entree purchase) that are padding the fee. It didn't bother me since I had a greatly reduced rate, but for $400-$500 a night, that extra $25 is no fun. That resort fee also includes a discount on valet parking, lowering it from $25/night to $15. If you don't choose to use the valet, parking here isn't all that great; it's a pretty lengthy walk from any of the free self-parking lots to the entrance, especially with bags. Those are all relatively minor slights, though, on an impressive resort.

The bars and restaurants have great happy hours and we enjoyed some early drinks most nights in the warm fall evenings. We had dinner at Blue Sage twice and it was delicious both times. The prices are reasonable and quiality high. The sushi at Roy's was a big disappointment - but drinks were delicious. My husband also ate at the Vista Lounge for a burger and it was great. Throughout the business meetings the catered food was also amazing, especially the breakfasts!! Location: You are in North Scottsdale so it's a bit of a drive to get to any main attractions. We took an ATV over to Fountain Hills and into the Saguargo National Park, which was really cool to see. I'd highly recommend one of these trips - ours was organized through Expedia's Destination Services.

Let me preface by saying we are Marriott \"elite\" members. We try to stay at Marriott as our standard hotel when ever possible. We are loyal in that regard and unless we are traveling to a destination location that has a special resort (such as in Australia , we usually chose a Marriott hotel/resort because they are reliable and we know what to expect, and generally speaking the communication is fantastic. Our first stay at the Marriott Desert Ridge was a few years ago. We booked a suite and on our arrival were so surprised when we arrived to our room and found we were placed in what was named the \u201cBoard Room\u201d. It was actually an approximately 800-1000 square foot large open studio suite which contained a living area with small patio and then a \u201cdining area/board room\u201d area which had a beautiful dining room table which would comfortably seat oh, I\u2019d say 10 people. There was also a hutch which had a selection of hard -back books in it. Mostly for show, but during our 4 night stay we did read a couple of them. The suite, used probably more for business gatherings could also be used for small impromptu cocktail receptions because it also had a small butlers pantry in another area which was accessed by a second entry door. This area included a small kitchenette with microwave, fridge, 2nd honor bar and wet bar. In our case it worked out perfectly for our long weekend. Oh- the bedroom was a pull down Murphy bed. Located in the living area. Worked for us. Good bed, nice selection of pillows and the robes were really nice as well. On this experience alone I would rate the resort 5 stars. We enjoyed the 24 hour room service, the fitness center and the on demand movies. The problems we have with the Marriott Desert Ridge is that we really like this room and on the following visits we have attempted to book and make use of this room to no avail. The first attempt we tried to book online and the room wasn\u2019t listed. So we called the hotel directly. After being shuffled from person to manger, we were informed that the room was not available anymore as a \u201csingle booking\u201d and if we wanted to book it we would have to book it tandem with an added room (with an adjoining door leading to a basic hotel room, which would end up costing us approximately 1/3 more per night)- or we could book a one bedroom suite and take our chances upon arrival that it would be available. We did the latter and it wasn\u2019t available on check in. We tried once more, and again no luck. The Marriott Desert Ridge is a nice hotel.

The resort is located near great restaurants and shopping is fairly nearby. However, the one problem we encountered was when we arrived at the golf course only to find that it was \"cart path only.\" A bit disingenuous since this had not been stated anywhere when we made the reservations several months ago. The pro shop told us that they seed every November and no carts are allowed until much later in the season. They said for medical reasons, a golfer can get a red flag, ride along the rough and cross at 90 degrees. OK, but still not resort golf. When I mentioned this at the hotel, they had no idea that this was going on at the golf course. They immediately offered to refund our money...again, very good service. Walking was not an issue for us. However, before you sign up for golf here, and before you travel to this resort, be sure to find out restrictions at the golf course.

Not a huge deal, but the service I've received other places. Our shower also leaked onto the bathroom floor like mad. We had to use our towels and mop the floor several times and request new towels.

I am a Platitunum Elite member and have been fortunate enought to have experienced many incredible resort stays, including a recent stay at the nearby Camelback Inn, in which we had our own private pool. That was lovely, but I can honestly say our stay at the Desert Ridge was absolutely perfect. Our kids said it was the best vacation they ever had, and we loved it, too. The property is older but has been updated, with each guest room fully remodeled last year. The property is very similar to the Starr Pass in Tucson, but the location and the activities are much better if you are looking for convenience and off-site attractions. The rooms are very clean and nicely furnished - something that is very important to me. We were upgraded to a nice suite, which is almost twice the size of a standard room and well-worth the additional cost if you can afford it. The service was outstanding. Everyone was so friendly, and the attention to good service was better than anything I have experienced. The front desk called to make sure that each of our special requests were taken care of according to our preference - even on a sold-out weekend, they took the time to do this. The activities were amazing, and our family stayed active the entire time. My husband and I visited the spa, which was a wonderful experience. I had the Desert Ridge massage, which was amazing!! I would suggest this treatment to anyone! The women's dressing room had everything you would want, includinga steam room, sauna, hot tub, outdoor showers, private showers and baths, grooming essentials, an outdoor pool, a relaxation room, a bisto, a great fitness center, and a nice boutique. My massage treatment included essential oils made from the on-site herb garden. My husband enjoyed his treatments, too, although he said the manicure and pedicure were over-priced and not as enjoyable. We had breakfast at the buffet each day, which was absolutely incredible. Dinner at Tuscany was very good, too. We also had dinner one night at the Sage, which was not as good as breakfast. The breakfast buffet was among the best I have had, with an omelet bar, homemade cinnamon rolls, fresh fruit an yogert, bagels and lox, breakfast meats, belgian waffles and pancackes, cereal bar, potatoes, mixed juices, and more. There are multiple pools and a waterslide. Staff are on hand to make sure you have a drink at all times, and they deliver to you even when you are moving around in the lazy river. There were s'mores at the firepit at night and a movie at the lazy river at night - along with balloons for the movie, \"Up!\" There were grills and snack stands at the pool. A large lawn for various activities, both stuctured and not. The resort provided beach balls and everything you need to have a great time. Valet parking is available, but we wish we had just parked ourselves to save the valet charge each day. There is a Starbucks on site, and plenty of bars and restaurants around, too.

We ended up spending $300 for one night, a bunch of poolside drinks (Kokopelli Pina Coladas were a hit) and breakfast and dinner for 4. The Fling and Swing package covered kids meals and resort fees.

When I travel, I like to know that the property would at least meet certain expectations, important when traveling for business and considering the value for what you are paying. This property exceeds any expectation that I had and has become my new Phoenix/SCottsdale go-to for ANY stays, business or pleasure. This particular trip was a quick get away for my wife and me. We needed to spend just a little down time in a relaxing atmosphere. While this is a resort - Golf, Spa, HUGE pool complex - there was still plenty of opportunities to relax and not be bothered by other people living their lives. It also is one of the few properties where they have a concierge lounge which they call the Cloud Club. It is an up charge, but well worth it - virtually 24 hours access, plenty of snacks that go WAY beyond crackers and cheese, a \"dinner\" snack that could easily pass for a meal and breakfast including omelets cooked to order. The Club staff is beyond accommodating and the particular chef that we had there, Lem, was entertaining and would create anything that we wanted and that he had available - on or off menu. They really tried to make you feel welcome and comfortable. What was truly nice was that there were no children allowed under 21 in the Club. I know, that sounds terrible, but the last property we stayed at with such a property (NOT a Marriott) allowed children and it was a nightmare - the parents had no control and were rude about it. The staff did absolutely nothing to prevent or even deal with the situation. But let me move forward. . . . The restaurants are all fabulous, and include a Roy's. I know, it is a chain, but Roy Yamaguci still has a hand in things and the food here is as if you went to one of the anchor locations. The lounge area can accommodate many, many people, and there is entertainment I believe every night. I mentioned the pool complex - it is huge. It has a restaurant/bar with a complete menu and just not a bunch of fried food. The pools themselves are sprawling all over the property and include a \"lazy river\" for those wanted to just drift. The spa/exercise facility is large and friendly (and comes with the Cloud Club package). The equipment is well maintained and they have free weights as well. The only draw back is it is a short walk outside and at an end of the sprawling property but hey - you're going to work out so a little walk is good for you , no? I would suspect that this property sees a fair amount of convention and business travel due to the size of the ballrooms and number of restaurants, lounge areas and places to \"hide\", so I would caution people to check to see if a convention is booked and what % of the bookings are used for that purpose. On the other hand, if I was looking to book a convention or gathering, this would absolutely be a top choice if not the top choice in the Scottsdale / Phoenix area. I would also \"caution\" that while I was never approached, this is somewhat attached to a Marriott Vacation Club. I did not know this when booking but again, it made no difference and I would not avoid the property because of this.", "Date": "August 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cExcellent resort!\u201d", "Author": "AlphaTangoZulu", "ReviewID": "UR116284220", "Content": "We stayed here for 3 days in mid July during the week and it was excellent!

Thought it would be great for water by the pool but when we went to try and claim it, well there was a whole hard-sell about going to the presentation.

The only issue I had is that I kept finding teeny spiders in the room (maybe because of the region?), even in our bed! That gave me the heeby-jeebies really good because I do NOT enjoy insects of any kind. Plus, I had my kid with me and I didn't know if they bit. I certainly didn't want to take them home in my luggage. A really nice lady at the front desk told me over the phone that the exterminator would be in our room probably within the hour, and I said this was fine, that we'd be at the pool. When we returned to our room a couple of hours later, I figured the exterminator had been there. My husband and daughter were napping when I got a phone call saying the exterminator was on his way up. That just would not do because where was I supposed to stash my sleeping 3 year old for the next couple of hours? Everyone knows you do NOT wake a sleeping child. : ) So the exterminator did not end up coming after all. Other than that, the hotel was fantastic wtih a great staff, very generous food portions (we ordered room service for breakfast each day, and once for lunch), and lots of activities. We were delighted to return to the hotel after graduation and find a live band playing in the lobby! Looked like alot of fun, though we were too tired to join in. Word of caution, WEAR SWIM SHOES AT THE POOL. The ground is blistering hot out there, and it would have been WAY too hot for my daughter to walk on, so I am glad I took a few steps first and found this out for myself. I would suggest that the hotel posts something about that or mentions it when guests check in that they will want to protect their feet. I am from Houston, Texas and it's plenty hot, but I've NEVER experienced that before. So just beware. This review would have a much different tone if my kid had blistered her feet on the asphalt. Across from the resort is an awesome shopping district that includes a theatre for beating the heat and of course the all important Target store!

The entire resort is supposed to be smoke free but people are smoking at the pools, in the rooms...I was walking into a cloud of smoke almost every turn..and this is a GIANT place. If you want free second hand smoke...this is your place. Complained to hotel...and was actually told that people are allowed to smoke on their balconies. WOW! I called back to double check and the manager assured me that she was mistaken and the resort is \"supposed\" to be smoke free. RIGHT........ We got a suite for us and our baby because we wanted a nicer room and experience. Well it's such a joke. Because...all of a sudden at 9pm...a HUGE group of people BURST into their STANDARD SIZED rooms (i say that in caps b/c standard rooms here are dirt cheap and so 8 people are splitting the room so it's only $25 a person...yup you get the picture of who stays here) throwing beer bottles around, rowdy as can be, playing beer pong...doing body shots...you name it...they were doing it. I think at one point, one of them threw each other on to the wall during a \"friendly\" fight because I thought something for sure was going to explode through my walls. I almost threw up when one of them went out for a smoke break on the balcony and said \"oh dang i can't wait to eat more sausages tomorrow.\" WTF??!!? Called front desk...hotel sent security to calm them down... Fast track... 2AM...awoken by the sound of beer bottles breaking on the OTHER side of our room. Another group of drunks swearing, obscenity, F bombs every other word, girls challenging to fight the guys...guys threatening to throw each other over the balcony! My baby was startled to death and and cryng hysterically because they were screaming next door throwing chairs around going in and out of the room and balcony nonstop. IT WAS LIKE A SCENE AT A BRAWL AT A $39/NIGHT MOTEL IN THE MIDDLE OF NO WHEREVILL. It was so disturbing and we had to pack up at 2 in the morning...baby crib, all our luggage, wet bathing suits (have you tried to pack up at 2am after you're awoken by drinks? it's not fun) etc so we can escape from this HELLISH place filled with NASTY PEOPLE! We went to check out at the front desk (by this time it was 3am)...I was furious already thinking we were the only who would be awake at this god awful hour. Nope. There were people walking around the hotel lobby shirtless, INSANELY INTOXICATED, PRACTICALLY WALKING INTO THE WALLS AND YET stillllllllll chugging their coor lights. I was shocked...and yet the front desk staff didn't even bat an eyelash..because THIS IS THE NORM OF THE CROWDS HERE. The pools are open 24/7...which you might think is great..but it's probably the biggest red flag because 24/7 pools means loud obnoxious drunks at all hours. STAY AWAY. DISGUSTING!!!

The rooms were well maintained and up to date - flat screen TV's and more. The Spa was first class - go for the hot rock message!! Keeping it real, the front desk did struggle to juggle the crowds. We requested a connecting room as we have teenagers and a 10 year old. We were arriving on a late flight from New York and we wanted to make sure everything was set upon check-in. A few days before I called to see if the request had been granted. I was told it was and that our rooms had been assigned. We arrived around midnight and they had given our connectors away. I was not happy as we had to separate the family on night one. Early the next morning I received a call from the front desk that they had found connecting rooms for us. What a relief! Unfortunately they moved us from a room with a view of the pools (which we paid an upgrade for) to rooms overlooking the parking lot. Again I was not happy. When I asked how this happened they told me \"take it our leave it. that's all we have\". Exactly in those words. I was so unhappy I called the other big resorts and was all set to check out the first day after I checked in! I decided to talk to the manager to see if anything else could be done. Thankfully, after some more juggling, we were put in a WONDERFUL room overlooking one of the isla's and golf course. The concierge was very, very knowledgable and helpful. We went off property for a few dinners and the recommendations were superb! The value for money without compromising quality was truly superb! Pay the resort fee - it is totally worth it and frees you up from fees that would otherwise annoy you at check out. I would highly recommend this resort to anyone traveling to Phoenix!

We live twenty five minutes away. I am a Elite Marriott member, for many, many years. I requested early check it for 12:00 PM. After waiting ten minutes at the Front Desk I was finally able to speak to Stefanie(very abrupt, and constantly reminded me that \"check in is not until 4:00 PM\". I made my reservation directly with the hotel in house reservation dept. Reba was helpful, Candice was of no help and needs to familiarize her self with this property and amenities . I made my requests through Stacey the concierge. I wanted to purchase the Cloud club membership. When I called the Marriott Elite number that advised me that no memberships were available, but speaking with Stacey she secured one for our trip. Needless to say we did not get early check in and we already felt like the Font Desk was not concerned, as they told me that my requested room was re booked with another guest as this room was on late check out. We proceeded to the Cloud Club to change attire for a round of golf. Allison was very nice and attentive. There was no coffee available so she made a fresh pot. We asked to store our luggage until we could get our room. I asked the bellman who came up to get our bag to bring to our room when it became available...he advised me that I would have to let them know when my room was available so then they could bring to that room. Staying in a 4-5 star hotel......that shows their lack of detail and service. The golf course was poor, the starter was letting golfers with scheduled tee times later that ours to proceed in front of us! We saw a beverage cart once and was told that food was available\"at the turn' which was in fact a sit down restaurant not really equipped to handle quick turn around for golfers. After golf we ventured back to the front desk to get our room key and went to the Cloud Club and were one of two couples in the facility. The one attendant was so involved with the other couple that I had to present myself to her to get a few beverages. Victoria was there and came out when some cheese and bread were available. I asked her for a cloth napkin...as they only had those little square napkins you put under a glass. she looked at me and said\" are you planning to make a big mess?\" I found that to be a very inappropriate comment as there was silverware but no cloth napkins. It was after 5:00 PM and the \"Discovery Hour was not available so we went to our room. The room was very dirty. The tile floor had spots of sticky soda. They mopped over it but the spot was still there and very evident. The walls on the front entry into the walk in closet and bathroom had some stringy lint like substance hanging off of the ceiling...I have pictures. There was bird feces on the balcony floor. Having to wait so long for a room you would think that if housekeeping did clean , then where was the supervisor who does final inspection? Still wanting to enjoy our weekend we gave it the old college try and ordered two strip steaks from room service. One well done and one medium well, mushrooms on the side......pretty simple. Not so. We were alarmed when we heard a knock on the door from the room service attendant, was getting dressed and before we were entirely clothed this man had already opened our door!!! I have NEVER heard of such a procedure! He took the lids off of the food and was on his way out the door when I said \" wait a moment I want to cut into the steaks and check them. They were both medium if not rare and one of them had mushrooms completely over the steak. This culminated to our overall experience with this hotel to be very very very poor. I notified the front desk and advised that we would be vacating the premise. This completely ruined my Easter Holiday and weekend. This hotel is more of a convention style property. They do not seem concerned with their Elite members, nor concerned that their Elite members are spending leisure time and money on a weekend, above and beyond the normal business travel week.", "Date": "April 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cAverage Service Level, Uncomfortable Furniture and Ants\u201d", "Author": "theLuckiestGuy", "ReviewID": "UR104972620", "Content": "Stayed in a 1 br suite with adjoining Room (so a 2br suite) for 5 nights.. this is one of those Arizona factory hotels.

I'm just surprised how disapointing the stay was knowing that up-front. Honorable mention to the hotel's service staff who were pleasant.

The hotel was very expensive and unless you are on an non-scrutinized business expense account, I would not recommend this property for leisure. It is overcrowded, underwhelming and not what you would expect of a Marriott or any luxury property for that matter. The rooms are three star at best and we were charged $500+ a night! The service was not there. The check in process was impersonal. The lobby was cold and uninviting. The housekeeping service was average, no turn down service! Maintenance was lousy, we had a broken air conditioner and toilet. Dishes and trash were in the hallways and public areas. It was as if they expect you to pay extra for an average room and lousy service because it has the JW brand name. We certainly did not get good value or have a good experience. About us: I am a Marriott rewards elite member. We were a group of several families with adults and children ranging from 9 to 18 yrs. We were in Phoenix for spring break. We have stayed at other Phoenix properties including Squaw Peak, Paradise Valley, the Buttes, etc. About the hotel: As a Marriott Vacation Club property, this consists of a main hotel building and canyon vacation villas (timeshares). There is a golf course and several pools on site. The resort's grounds are nice but not easily accessible since most of the green space is reserved for the golf course. There is a road that you can walk down. There is a elite concierge lounge, but this was not available due to a group being at the hotel. The breakfast buffet is good but costs $25 a person, ouch that's steep for a large group with teens for a breakfast that should be included. The food at the pools was lousy and is expensive, certainly not what you would expect at a JW. The drinks are also expensive expect to pay dearly for every drink for you and your kids. The only bright spots were a Roy's restaurant on property which has an excellent happy hour and a Starbucks Coffee. Other than that expect crowds and to spend lot's of money: crowded pools, crowded lounges, crowded lobbies and nowhere to relax. The pool area is like a zoo cage where you need to go through a single point of entry either with key card or a daily wrist band. The pools are OK but very crowded. The water was too warm for our tastes. It is hard to get chairs by the pools so get there early to reserve. There are 3 pools and a lazy river. There is also a large hot tub but it was too hot for me. There was a mix of families their with young children, teens and business people with spouses. As a side note, the signs to the left of the lobby that direct you to the pool were wrong and lead you to a gate that you cannot enter. Our room was a connecting room. The room was loud from the noise of the air conditioner and we could not sleep. When we requested to be moved, the front desk refused saying there was nothing available. We were also given an accessible room which was specifically not our request. The toilet was also broken. When I mentioned this to the front desk, they did nothing. This is poor customer service. We asked for a restaurant recommendation & reservation from the concierge and they sent us to one of the most expensive restaurants in town (Sassi) it ended up costing us over $50 pp for pizza and pasta including the kids meals! Not very considerate. We then found Kierland Mall area which has Maggianos, PF Changs, etc. There is also a mall across Deer Valley that has an Albertsons and other stores. In short, my experience was that the JW Desert Ridge was overpriced, overcrowded, my room was poor, the service was not there and did not deliver on any of my expectations.

I was Working in Desert Ridge so location was great. I will try to keep this brief and point out some areas for consideration if you are visiting Phoenix for the first time. Firstly, you must hire a car as I only saw 1 bus in the whole week I was there and nothing is walkable. The hotel was about a 35 minute drive to the north of downtown and the airport. The hotel is huge but never feels overcrowded. As I had travelled from the UK I suffered from waking up at around 5am after my first night - no worries. I was straight down the gym (accessed by key card) onto the treadmill and then beat of all into the lazy river for a swim around watching the rabbits and sunrise. Then into the hot ub at around 6.30am, fabulous! Then, breakfast al fresco at the hotel - full buffet with everything you can imagine. I was especially fond of the counter full of fresh berries (2 plates full per day). As I arrived on a Saturday - on Sunday we jumped in the car and headed north to Anyhem Outlet mall (30 minute drive). To cut to the chase, well worth a visit (Nike / Ralph Lauren and so on), but you are just as likely to get a bargain at Macy's at Paradise Mall (I picked up a RL Hoodie and RL Lambswool v neck for $55 in total. Needless to say, food is fantastic, recommend the Cheesecake Factory. One evening after work we headed downtown to catch a Phoenix Suns game (NBA) - again would recommend you can book tickets from the UK (around \u00a325). We parked at the venue for $15 and ate at Coopers Town - Alice Coopers' place opposite the US Airways Center - go for the 'Big Unit' a 22 inch hot dog!

The charge for parking is $10.00 per day. We had to ask for the coffee and paper cups to be replaced everyday. The towels were low quality, dingy and scarce. Again, at this price point I expect better. The hotel was basically empty until the day we left when a convention group began to arrive. I guess the economy isn't so bad that this hotel feels they need to step up the quaiity to attract the independent guests. The facilities were nice but because of the irritating charges for the smallest things, we won't stay at the J.W. Marriott again.", "Date": "January 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philly", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay for our Anniversary!\u201d", "Author": "Scott_in_Philly", "ReviewID": "UR92548305", "Content": "My wife and I spent 5 nights at the JW Marriott Desert Ridge to celebrate our anniversary. We arrived on a Friday and left on a Wednesday. Due to some airport delays, we didn't make it to the hotel until about 7PM. After working that morning, traveling all day, and not eating much along the way, we were pretty drained when we arrived. We had originally planned to go outside the resort to eat dinner, but by the time we got there, we just wanted to collapse. We decided to just eat on-site at the hotel and ended up at Tuscany. This proved to be a great choice. The wife had a great pasta dish as I scarfed down a pizza. Admittedly, we were probably underdressed for this place, but the staff made us feel very welcome and were quite understanding of our travel experience. We didn't plan on eating here, but having done so, I would definitely recommend it if you are staying at the hotel. If it is warm enough, consider dining outside on the patio that overlooks the Isle of Capri. We ventured back to our room and crashed. I woke up the next morning to a beautiful sunrise over the mountains with a view of the Isle of Capri in front of me. We had booked a standard room using Marriott points, and were upgraded to a Signature View room. It definitely did have a very nice view. I ended up spending a lot of time out on the balcony, just reflecting and thinking about how fortunate I was. Other than a suite, I can't think of any other room I would have preferred in this hotel. It had just about the best view I could have hoped for. Many thanks to the Marriott staff for placing us here!! Although I did play golf every day that I was out there, we did spend a good amount of time just relaxing at the resort. Many afternoons were spent poolside. All of the pools there are heated and at quite a comfortable temperature. There are multiple options when it comes to the pools. There is a large pool with a fountain structure built in the middle of it. There is also more of a quiet pool for swimming laps nearby, as well as a small area for younger kids to sit in the water and play. A decent size hot tub is in the same area too. Unfortunately, the lazy river was closed while we were there. They did a good job of hiding it from the public though. If we didn't know it existed, we would never had known it was there. This is a good thing if you have younger kids, as I would imagine they would see it and be quite disappointed. Our favorite place to relax was the spa pool though. It is far removed from the main pool complex and there were no little kids running around here. Don't get me wrong, I love kids and know to expect lots of yelling and splashing at a place like this. Sometimes, it is nice to have the option to escape to peace and serenity though, and that is what we got at the spa pool. Since we are Marriott Rewards Gold members, we did not have to pay to use the facilities. It is included if you get a treatment at the spa, otherwise, I think you have to pay a minimal fee. As for dining, we did try out most of the dining outlets at the property, as well as venture off-site a good bit. For breakfast, we did try out Blue Sage one time. The food was good, but it wasn't anything spectacular. There is a Starbucks on site that provides a quicker option. Across the street from the hotel is the Desert Ridge Marketplace, and most notably an Einstein Bagel. Most of our breakfasts were here. It's great if you don't need a big breakfast buffet. We did have lunch once at the poolside restaurant, Just a Splash. It was your average resort poolside fare. Not bad, but not spectacular either. It is good if you are hanging at the pool and don't feel like getting up out of your seat though. A much better lunch option can be found at the Spa. There are some really tasty, and really healthy options on the menu. And the fruit smoothies there are awesome (not to mention cheaper, significantly better and much larger than the ones at the other pool). If you find yourself craving fast-food, there is an In-n-Out Burger across the street from the hotel (in the Desrt Ridge Marketplace). Aside from our dinner at Tuscany that first night, we ate outside of the resort for our dinners. There are a number of great restaurants in the area. Down the street from the hotel is the CityNorth shopping area. There are a few options there, including Ocean Prime, which offered great steak and seafood. About 15 minutes away is Kierland Commons. This is a very well built up area with multiple great dining options and lots of shopping for the wife! We often stayed at the hotel for Happy Hour and then ate later dinners. There is the Vista Lounge, which has live entertainment and great specials. Roy's also has an Aloha Hour from 4-6PM. $5 for huge frozen margaritas became a daily event, as did the $5 drinks and appetizers at Roy's. I am generally quite active on my vacations, but there is something to be said for just relaxing to the music with a frozen drink in hand! As we were there a bit before Christmas time, the resort was nicely decorated for the holidays. One of the coolest things was the massive gingerbread complex (not house) that they built over the prior month that magically popped up in the lobby overnight. The picture doesn't do it justice. It was too cool....just an example of how the hotel goes above and beyond here. If there is a fault to this hotel, it would be the resort fee that everyone complains about. It was $16 for us as Marriott Regard Gold members and $25 if you are not. They give you a list of things that it gets you, but none of it really applies. You get 10% off in the shops at the hotel, but not the main gift shop, which is where we bought gifts! It does include self-parking fees or a $10 discount off the valet parking, but that is about it. Yes, it does suck. But there isn't anything you can do about it, so get over it before you arrive and don't let it spoil your trip. All in all, we loved this place! I have been to many fine resorts all over the world. While this isn't the Four Seasons, it is a very nice 4 Star Resort. It is one of the best Marriott properties I have been to, maybe the best (and yes, I have been to the ones in Hawaii). If you are thinking about coming here, don't think about it any longer.

We'll share the positives as well as our concerns about our stay. We likely will not stay here again. The Fairmont and Westin Kierland are much nicer options. Positives: Enjoyed the lounge entertainment on Sat. night, employees friendly, fairly comfortable bed (although the bedding is surprisingly loud), Roy's is a fantastic restaurant, nice food options available all day at the resort, jacuzzi was nice (although a long walk), enjoyed the golf, and close to shopping area with many restaurant options and movie theatre. The pools look nice, although it was too cold for us to enjoy them. There is a very small fridge in the room and an electronics center that allows for easy cell phone charging, video connections, etc. Negatives: This is not a well designed resort and there are many down sides to room views. One must walk long distances to various things, and many of the rooms are way out on the ends which requires considerable walking, and real possibilities of getting lost. It is necessary to walk outside to get to the general fitness area and there is no bathroom available there. Our first room had a terrible view of the roof. We requested to be moved, and the second room had a terrible view of a construction area. Requested to move again, and they finally put us in a better location, although could here the lounge music and if it had been warm would have had considerable pool noise. Really have to be persistent to get a room with a decent location here and pay top dollar. They aren't in a hurry to upgrade! Things in our room were average at best. The heating/cooling system is a bit loud and made sleep less enjoyable. We're not hard to please, but really did feel disappointed with the quality here. The cleanliness could have been better; there were considerable food crumbs in our room that we had to clean off the chairs ourselves, and the second and third days they were still not vacuumed from the floor. Our bathroom was not well cleaned the second day. The furniture in the lounge needs to be cleaned or replaced. There is a $25/day resort fee that includes internet access, the basic fitness center only, and self-parking...not a deal....it's a pretty long walk with no sidewalks so you must walk the main drive with vehicles. Overall, feel this place is trying to sell itself as a top of the line resort, but is very average. I wouldn't spend the money again; only worth it if you can get a great deal that is $100ish/day. If you're going to spend $200-300/day stay somewhere else.", "Date": "January 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cClass Act\u201d", "Author": "2batravelfan", "ReviewID": "UR89436416", "Content": "The employees are professional and well trained.

I thought it was odd though that I could get so many things for free but had to pay 2 dollars for a pain reliever. The hotel had about three different restaurants. We only ate at one -the Blue Sage, but we heard that Roy's Hawaiian was also very good. The hotel is located very close to a shopping mall and it was easy to call for a town car with a flat rate of $5 (very good deal). I could go shopping while my husband was working. Because it was summer and the weather was really dry and hot, there were not many tourists or guests at the hotel and I appreciated that. The pools were well taken care of and there is a lazy river. In short, this place is a great way to relax and enjoy without even leaving at all during your stay! The best part of our stay was the Revive Spa. I elected the Arizona Experience and it was amazing. The hot stone massage was done by a very gentle masseuse who was very in tune with what I needed. The facial left my face feeling extremely soft, revived, refreshed and renewed. My skin was glowing! The spa also has a private pool so that if you don't feel like mingling at the other pools, you can just be by yourself (maybe with a few other people). Later on, I was able to rent a car from the agency in the hotel and I drove out to Scottsdale to do some sight seeing and more shopping.

A great choice since we had a fantastic time. We have stayed at 3 - 4 other JW's and Ritz properties and the Dessert Ridge is one of the best.

The standard guest rooms here are much, much larger than even the Ritz rooms we've stayed in the past. The bath rooms also are very large and plenty of room for two people. Bravo Marriot for breaking with past culture and expanding the size of these rooms. A few pointers: The Cloud Club is well worth the money. It's $100 a day per room or $75 a day if you are a Marriott Gold Elite member. This inlcudes the $25 per day Resort Fee and the $16 per day Self Park charge so essentially its $59 a day regular guest or $34 a day for Gold Elite members. It provides access to the spa area and the spa pool. This pool is pure paradise!! Very quiet and totally relaxation for adults only. Cloud Club has a great cooked to order breakfast with fresh fruit, pastries, bagels, etc.. Happy hour with nice selection of wine & beer, mixed drinks, soft drinks, bottled water, etc.. The food at night is very nice and all you need before dinner. Self Park- no big deal...just a 2 minute walk even in 100 degree heat. No sweat...sorry couldn't resist. Runners & Walkers- great location for both. Right out of resort onto Deer Valley Dr. cross Tatum Rd. go about 1/4 mile and will intersect with a shaded trail through a subdivision. Nice place to run or walk. Golf: The Faldo course is excellant. Irish links course in the dessert.

We decided on JW Marriott Desert Ridge because of its amenities (pools, location-we loved the Desert Ridge Marketplace for all of our shopping) and with the package we were also given a breakfast buffet. Let me tell you, it would have costed us $23 EACH daily to partake of the buffet food (which we wouldn't have paid-we would have stocked up at the local Albertson's instead). But, because it was included in our package deal, I must say it was well worth it! They had so much fruit, sausages, potatoes, breads, pastries, juices, pancakes, waffles and made to order omelets!!!!! There was so much food, we ate until we couldn't eat anymore and then spent most of the afternoon at the pools. We finally started to get hungry again around 6pm!!! It was that filling. The grounds here are beautiful and we enjoyed seeing all of the desert plant and animal life. There aren't any palm trees in the midwest so it was wonderful to just marvel at them there. Our room was basic which was fine for us and once we arrived, we requested a mini fridge which was brought to our room about 15 minutes later. The bed was so comfortable to sleep on and the furnishings were modern looking. My husband loved the 42\" flat screen TV. My husband did have one complaint though. He really wanted to see a fan in the bathroom. I would have to agree. One more thing; we came on this trip for relaxation (job stress and time away from the kids) and were so glad that the school year had begun as there weren't many kids running around and making noise in the pool area. Quite frankly, there weren't many people at all at this resort during our stay. That is probably why we received such a great rate to begin with.

After reading through many and relating to a few, I would like to add my 2 cents and strong positive support of the resort. True, the room was no great shakes, but the property was beautiful. True, it is large enough to warrant getting a map, but it wasn't so big that you couldn't get around without one. True, service at restaurants was spotty, but it was great to have so many choices on-site. And if the service was bad, or the food unmemorable, you could always go to the shopping center across the street that has a wide variety of restaurants to choose from. I highly recommend Mimi's Cafe for good food and good prices. A local's favorite, you may have to wait a while to be seated, but it's worth it -- great breakfast. I felt the resort staff was extremely nice and helpful, but restaurant/lounge staff attentiveness was spotty. We went to attend Spring training games (go Mariners!) but were outnumbered by families on Spring Break vacations. Personally, I have no problem with sharing \"my resort\" with families. On the one hand, it's our bad luck that we're paying premium airfare because it is a very popular travel time for vacationing families, but on the other hand, what a fabulous respite from rainy, dreary March in Seattle. Worth the price of the plane ticket. Our favorite things: for my husband, the fitness center and spa which he visited every morning. First class and never over-crowded. For me, taking long walks in the morning while he was doing his workout. I walked city streets into neighborhoods but the sidewalks were wide and are flat, safe and easily accessible. Did I mention what a fabulous respite this warm March weather was from our cold, wet Seattle March weather? You can't beat it. Other favorite things: drinks on the sofas/club chairs facing the grassy knoll (good sushi btw); Meritage Steak House - not necessarily the best steak I've ever had, but a nice atmosphere; people watching (we also were there during Fight Night and personally saw or heard of many celebrity sightings); warm weather - oh, I already mentioned that. Usually at this point I'd say \"you'll really like it\" but reading the past reviews, it's clear that people are looking for different things in their vacation stays, so this may not suit the bill for you.

We visited the property when it was new and decided to visit Scottsdale in July, during the 4th holiday........what were we thinking? But......we were pleasantly surprised. The Desert Ridge is a beautiful property with excellent restaurants on property including Roy's, Blue Sage and Tuscany, and within a short drive (about 2 minutes) you have California Pizza Kitchen, Macaroni Grill, and many others. The property is a nice expansive property, but done right. They are going through a update to the rooms. We were in one of the newer updated rooms and the amenities were fine. We had two rooms (one king with pullout sofa and a double). We had no issues. Plenty of channels on the t.v. and plenty of room in the bath. The amenities of the hotel include golf and the more popular river pool. Needless to say, it is true it can get crowded around the pool. The water is cool in the morning, but warms up quickly during the day. They provide tubes for coasting down the river, along with the Nickelodeon adventure of poolside shows for the kids at the pool. The servers around the pool do their best to take care of customers, but it can be a bit of a wait for drinks or food. For the most part, we found everyone to be courteous and accomodative. Usually two people \"cruise\" the area, so if you get missed, someone is likely to come by. We spent time all over the pool. There is something for adults and families. The fitness room is fine, with treadmills, ellipticals, bike, and stairmasters with television. THere are free weights and other equipment. Nice facility close by the pool. Didn't use the spa, but I'm sure that's nice. I noticed one review as it related to the courtesy of the staff, I cannot disagree with that comment more. I found ALL staff members to be polite, courteous and professional, following the Ritz Carlton ways. You may be asking, is it worth it going in the summer........AZ is a dry heat. It hit 113 while we were therey, and while hot, there are ways to cool off. The rooms were comfortablely cool all the time (which was an issue on our prior trip).. THe Blue Sage restuarant was very good . We did the Nick package deal where kids under 12 eat free.........BEST DEAL GOING.

They have a simply divine lounge with outside seating that isn't too noisy even if there is an event which is not that often. The lounge area extends outside and is a very large area with lovely comfortable seating where you can have your pre dinner drink around their attractive firepits.

Let me preface by saying that I have stayed all at types of all inclusives (including Mexico and the Carribeans), and the package that we got for the Desert Ridge was as close as you can get to an all inclusive here in the States. I found an incredible deal that included daily breakfast buffets ($22 value per person), daily found of golf for the guys ($130 value per person), plus daily 50 min spa treatment for the ladies (valued at over $130 per person). We got the whole package for about $250 per room daily. You can't beat that! Pros: Hotel: Beautiful layout. The grounds were immaculate. For those that say it is too big, go and check out the Mexican resorts...now that is big. Nothing looked run down, people always cleaning Pool: A hit with the kids. Lazy river and water slide was nice. Attentive wait staff around the pool as well. Room: We got the 2 bedroom connecting. It was perfect for 2 families (4 adults, 4 kids). The kitchenette was perfect. We loved the Murphy bed and extra full bath in the living room. Allowed the men to leave early for golf without disturbing the rest. Our room was 3406 and was easy walking distance to everything (including Golf course). Food: This was the biggest surprise. Food was terrific. Food was well priced for a big resort. Plus with the resort fee, kids eat free! We literally save $100s on that alone. There was always happy hour with decent priced drinks. We ate at the Blue Sage (terrific breakfast buffet), Tuscany (great ambience if you sit outside), and the Meritage Steakhouse. We had lots of picky eaters and all thought the food was great Service: This too was outstanding. Everyone was friendly. There was a housekeeper/engineer named Thomas who even went out of his way to get us free drink coupons. Everyone tried to cater to our big group. They even compensated us (gave us a credit) for a fire alarm that went off in the middle of the night. The \"At Your Service\" number was always able to help us with reservations and anything else we needed. Golf/Spa- Having this included in the package was awesome. I called well ahead and made tee times and spa reservations well in advanced. Golf clubs were taken from our car and was always ready for us at the cart each morning. The courses were in great condition. The practice range and greens were perfect. The staff was also very friendly and helpful. My recommendation would be to make an early tee time (<8am). The spa, per the women, was wonderful. The waiting room was nice and all treatments were enjoyed. Tip is automatically added to your bill. Cons: - Rooms weren't ready til exactly 4pm. A tad annoying - The carpets in most of the rooms were loose and worn down - Pool got really really crowded during the weekends. Hard to find chairs and lounges - Beds were really soft and worn down - Towels at the pool also appeared worn down and frayed - Buffet gratuity for party >8 was automatically 18%. Did not understand this - Would have liked to be able to rent a cabana at the main pool All in all, you could not ask for a better deal for a family vacation.

Our room (deluxe view room...standard with a nice view) was very well appointed. It was plenty large enough for two adults and a child (or two).

The bathroom was an excellent size and with equally impressive high quality materials and design. As many write about, the pool complex with lazy river and water slide was outstanding! The Best! The water temperature was terrific and the cleanliness of the pool area and water was tops. Our kids loved their days here. The only problem we had was trying to pry them out of the water and sun before being too badly sunburnt. Also, our kids loved the Nickolodeon Kids Activities that the hotel sponsored. We did a Nickolodeon Breakfast with Dora and Spongebob that they really enjoyed. Also, the Kids Club was fantastic. They did a pajama party one night while the adults had a great dinner...and then wanted to go back a day later for a half a day at the Kids Club...always a good sign when they want to go back. Nickolodeon also sponsored several poolside events and arts and crafts which was terrific as well. The restaurants and service at the hotel were all equally great. We have a wheat/gluten allergy in the family and were blown away by the excellence and awareness of the hotel and its staff. Every restaurant had a dedicated and extensive gluten free menu! This is an extreme rarity...which we really appreciated. The only other hotel that was this excellent on this front happened to also be a JW Marriott...(JW Marriott Grande Lakes Orlando). Marriott really is outstanding in this area. Breakfast in the morning at Blue Sage was always a treat...very high quality and diverse...whether you do the buffet or off the menu. Dinners at Tuscana (Italian and our favorite), steaks at Meritage, or pacific fusion at Roys were all excellent with great ambiance, quality food, and service to boot.

The king and pullout was better. The doubles are very small and my tall husband and I were fighting for space in the middle of night. I called for more pillows and was told they were out- doubles have 2 pillows on them-- 2 very lumpy small pillows. Kings have at least 6 pillows. I did not think the rooms were very clean-- not for 4 stars. The Kierland has much better rooms, beds and pillows. We went primarily for the pool. We went out at 8:00 in the morning and noticed about 85% of the chairs were already taken- oddly there were only about 15 people around. It is obvious that people get up very early and go down and save seats at the pools. They have a sign that says they will remove articles from seats that have been unattended for 30 minutes---- this never happens. We watched as people left their seats saved for up to three hours. They do not have any cabana rentals in the family pool areas. It was stressful to think about waking up early just so we have spots at the pool. This place is also very stingy with their towels. 1 towel per person and they check off your room number- if you ask for more you are charged. This is ridiculous considering the towels are half the size of the chairs and the chairas are in pretty bad shape and not very comfortable. Again, Kierland beats their pool. The lazy river at the Desert Ridge is average. They have many pools but they are all small and not very enticing to kids. Kierlands beach access, plentiful towels, comfy chairs, tables beside the chairs, service, etc.... had me regretting the pool I was sitting by at the Desert Ridge. Valet is $25 a day- Self park is $10 although the website says it is free- Seriously? $10 to park your car 2 miles away? Bathroom configuration is weird- In both rooms shower door would not open all the way because toilet is so close. Shower is a tight fit. Pina Colodas with toasted coconut along the rim were fantastic. Yes, they are $12 but I feel that price is about average for a good pina coloda. It is in a great location with a Target very closeby. They have plenty of nearby off site palces to eat and shop. This place is better than the Phoenician. We were cosidering moving hotels so we went to tour the Phoenician. It is very tired--- needs rejuvinating. Must be why it was the only 4 or 5 star place with rooms still available.

The rooms. The rooms are small and not much thought seems to have gone into the decor. Unattractive wallpaper which makes the room seem even smaller than it is. Mismatched furniture. Positively the most unattractive headboards I have ever seen. Bedding not especially memorable. Pillows were terrible. Artwork mediocre. No theme. The only good thing about the room was the flat screen LG TV and we had a really nice territorial view. There is a small balcony with two chairs that we did not use.

There is a coffee maker in the room but no coffee pot or coffee==that will cost you extra. There is no ice maker anywhere, you have to order ice from room service which we presumed was about $5 for a handful of ice. There isn't even WI-Fi in the rooms. Instead there are some areas around the front lobby that you can get connected but expect to pay about $13 to get connected each day. I declined this \"service\" so I'm not sure if they also charge you for actual time spent on the net. While our room was paid for by employer, the resort still wanted our credit card for \"incidentals\" that they expect you to have to pay while there. The grounds and area are really well kept and beautiful and a walk around the outside of the facility is a must do. We didn't go into the swimming pool area because you have to swipe your room key into the gate to get in and we expected that would also be an \"incidental\" we didn't want to pay for since we were not going to actually swim. There are several of the typical shops and restaurants found in most well appointed malls and shopping centers just across the street from the hotel grounds but it is a fairly good (albeit pretty) walk from the hotel to this area.

We would never return to the Keg because we've had much better prime rib at less than half the cost of this place. We thought initially the Keg was going to be really good just because their prices were extaordinarily high but then you don't always get what you pay for, certainly you don't at the Keg. However, Steamers Seafood Restaurant located closer into downtown Scottsdale was a real treat. The shrimp, scallops, and fish were very good and the prices are reasonable.

When I checked in I asked to confirmed the package but they said \" no free breakfast\". After a long discussion they eventually agreed to honour what I had been told and not charge for the breakfast. However when I checked out they had charged for the breakfast !.. That was another long conversation but they did eventually cancel that charge. They had also not applied the$ 100 credit to my dinner at Roys restaurant at the hotel . I took issue with this when I checked out and got the bill and they said \" that resturant is on our property but not owned by us so you cannot use the credit. \" I said that was the first time I had been told that and if I had known I would have eaten at one of their other restaurants . They said that when they gave me my room key there was some small print on the documents attached stating that Roys was excluded, , so I had to pay for that dinner. ( When I got home I found the papers they gave me when I checked in and there was NO mention of the fact that I could not use the credit at Roys) . When I checked out I asked if I could use some of the unused credit for lunch . They said that was fine. However that was then charged to my credit card, but when I raised the issue they cancelled it. . This was all such a hassle I would not return. I got the clear impression that they will charge for everything they can and hope you do not notice. The second issue I had was that despite a very good range of pools, not one was \" adults only\" and all had noisy kids so I had no peace to read.

Marriott Spa & Resort for three nights for a business event. Staff were all very friendly and helpful. The facility is gorgeous! I could have spent most of my trip in the lobby or the huge arrival verandah. This impressive property blends very well with the natural surroundings and I was thrilled to see jack-rabbits eating grass on the lawn on my way to breakfast. Dining outside was a treat as well since all sorts of birds, including hummingbirds happily mingled with diners and staff and more aggressive species waited to snatch left overs from the buffets and clearing trays. The impressive labeled native plant collection on the walking paths and an adequate number of big comfy wooden benches and chairs made it easy to tolerate the high temperatures (102 - 106 during my stay). The distant mountain range was an impressive view from my balcony. A colleague said she'd seen a coyote on the path during an early morning jog. This facility is definitely for nature lovers and is a perfect backdrop for nature photography. My king room was adequate, though the color scheme and decor made it a little too casual - might do well with an update. The room and the entire hotel were clean and tidy though. In my room was a large desk with ethernet (wi-fi is free in the lobby), big screen TV, large chest with in-room safe, large closet, loads of large mirrors, a seating area with loveseat and coffee table and a large bath with deep soaking tub and separate glass shower. When I reported the toilet handle was barely attached to the tank when I got to my room maintenance arrived promptly to make the repair and the front desk followed up via phone to ensure all was well. Meeting areas were great but our group was quite large so we utilized several salons. Because of the size of the room it was difficult to view either of the huge screens while presenting from the center of the stage. One thing everyone noted was the hotel catering staff for the meeting was reluctant to leave the buffets out for very long even though the meeting frequently ran past break time. Stragglers arrived to the foyer to find the serving trays had already been removed though there had still been plenty of food. Food during the meeting and via room service was good, nothing extraordinary but certainly not inedible. The resort boasts several restaurants though I did not get a chance to try any of them. There is also a spa, golf course, swimming pool with 'rafting,' a Starbuck's and Kinko's as well as several upscale shops. Kiosks to print boarding passes are across from the front desk and are a welcome convenience. The conscierge desk staff was even there late evening to help facilitate day trips or outings and there was a multitude of brochures to peruse. Each morning, a variety of newspapers were available at reception. Despite the magnitude and elegance of the entry and reception, the main focus at Marriott Spa & Resort seems to be comfort and a down to earth friendly, cheerful approach. I suppose that would explain the sunny yellows and bright colors in the rooms rather than more somber and stuffy elegance. One point to keep in mind if heading here for a stay is the resort is very large. I was on one end of the building on the lobby level and my meeting was at the other end. It was easily a ten minute walk, albeit through the beautiful lobby and past a bank of windows through which I could watch the bunnies enjoying the lawn. Marriott was advertising a deal, $99 a night for up to four nights for a future visit but it was necessary to prepay and I wasn't sure when I'd be in Phoenix again so I didn't get details but I would definitely recommend this property for leisure or business especially at those savings!", "Date": "September 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cLocation\u201d", "Author": "Chopalua", "ReviewID": "UR43172119", "Content": "The hotel is located on a huge parcel.

We had never stayed there before. The first night, we got a local rate of $111 for the night. The arrival, valet and check-in process was smooth and everyone greeted us and made us feel welcomed. The room was spacious with a king bed, big couch, desk, flat-screen TV, balcony and a huge bathroom with separate soaking tub and shower. The bed was very comfortable and the linens were top of the line. We spent most of the day relaxing in the room or walking around the resort holding hands. It was great! For dinner, we ate at Roy's, one of the restaurants at the hotel. It serves Roy Yamaguchi's renowned Hawaiian Fusion Cuisine in a festive, island-style atmosphere. The food was great and the service even better. The second night, we did the \"Buy two massages and get your hotel night free\" deal ... the two massages were only $175 total and they were great! The Revive Spa truly lives up to the hype and advertising ... it is luxurious, well-appointed, soothing, clean and the service is outstanding. My wife and I got a couple of great massages and spent most of the day at the spa, swimming in the pool, eating at the spa cafe and taking advantage of the amenities. For dinner, we just decided to sit outside at the Vista Lounge, had a couple of drinks and ordered some sushi rolls. They were really good! Later, back in the room, we got the munchies and I decided to order a Chicken Pot Pie from the Blue Sage Restaurant. This was the only down side to the whole experience ... it was the worst Chicken Pot Pie I have ever had! Oh well. The next morning, the check-out process was painless as all we had to do was drop the key off at the front desk. The valet had our car waiting, loaded our bags and off we went for the five mile drive home. Overall, I give the JW Marriott Desert Ridge the highest rating I have ever given a resort. The facility is new, fresh, modern, clean and inviting. The staff are, without question, friendly and very, very service-oriented. And just about all of the food was fantastic. I know the prices for the accomodations become quite steep in the winter during high season, but if you can get a deal, I would highly recommend this resort in every way.

A convention at the hotel did push the limit of capacity at the Blue Sage restaurant but nothing beyond that experienced by most major city restaurants on a Saturday night. We found ourselves waiting for 45 minutes to be seated for a buffet. The hostess was useless and couldn\u2019t seem to \u201cfinds\u201d any of the parties whose name she whispered (there was no hearing her meek calls over the talk of the people waiting). My husband and I eventually walked in to \u201csee\u201d buffet and noticed several empty tables for two. Still we continued to wait. After finally being seated, we noticed quickly that the large numbers of wait staff did a lot of running around but accomplished very little on each \u201ctrip\u201d. The service should have been relatively easy given that most customers chose the buffet. Our first thought was that our table was not assigned though we were in the front room and passed by every server going to the kitchen, bar, and hostess station. The hostess by then had been joined by a young man who seemed to be the only individual trying to solve problems. He seated us, got us our water, cleared tables and sat the crowd the hostess couldn\u2019t seem to handle. We waited 15 more minutes for someone to take our drink order so we could tell them we wanted the $19.95 buffet. Finally a rather abrupt waiter came by and gave us permission to go the buffet. The \u201cadult\u201d buffet food was good but small plates and bowls for deserts and soup were not available. The waiter appeared for what was only his second visit to bring our check. When we finished eating, we continued to wait for another 30 minutes for our money to be taken and another 10 for our change. By this time there were about 4 tables left in the restaurant with patrons seated. Our wait gave us time to watch the hostess take 30 minutes to buss a table across from us with ADD like distractions pulling her away to seemingly meaningless tasks every few seconds. The entire staff was now in closing mode and we were completely unable to make eye contact with anyone. Luckily we were not in a hurry and decided to make the best of watching and chuckling at this hapless display of disorganization. After more than two hours we went to just outside the restaurant to the large patio area to enjoy a drink. No server asked us our order though they did serve other guests around us. We then ventured to the lobby bar are where we experienced the same non-service.

We checked in between 2 and 3 on a Friday afternoon -- valet was wonderful, bellman took our bags, and we checked in.

We were also offered the option of opting \"out\" of the resort fee -- which I thought was required, but I see from several other reviews that that appears to be something this Marriott is doing this summer. I was very excited not to have to pay $25 just to save $10 on valet parking which was the only \"feature\" of the resort fee that was of any value to us. We were there to relax and did not need internet access, no kids, etc, etc, etc... However, it appeared on our bill the 2nd night. A quick discussion upon checkout and it was promptly removed. Nice. Very nice. We got everything we asked for: extra pillows, extra towels, within 1/2 an hour of checking in. Our suite was lovely -- huge bathroom all done in marble and granite, nice bed, wonderful bed linens, flat screen TV. Beautiful double balcony where we enjoyed our morning coffee. The \"living room\" furniture was dated with the support on the chairs and sofa, worn out. Since we didn't really need/use that room, that was not an issue for us. The property was built about 2002, so it's coming up on time for a re-do. I did notice that part of our hallway had different carpeting and door number signs -- very pretty -- maybe a sign of things to come? We also upgraded to the Cloud Club -- which is a very good value for 2 people -- especially if one of them has Marriott rewards elite status.

We received an email from the hotel concierge asking for any other special requests...and all of them were met. Great view, high floor, extra pillows etc. The room was very large with a huge balcony overlooking the pool area. The bathroom was also very large with a tub and a seperate shower. The entire bathroom was travertine and granite. Perfectly clean and well appointed with a blow dryer, toiletries etc. The fabrics in the room were a bit dated but the bed was all white high quality linens. The matttress was extra cushy. My king room had a small sofa that also pulled out into a bed. The armoire at the foot of the bed had a 42\" high def flat screen. It was also outfitted with plug ins for computer, Ipod with power cords in the roomy closet to make all the needed connections. There was also a mini bar and very small frdige in the armoire as well as a small safe. The closet was large and had many hangers, 2 plush spa robes, a full size ironing board and iron, coffee service and the entertainment plugs mentioned above. Large sliding doors went out onto a semi private balcony. It had plenty of room to relax and it was awesome to sit out there in the morning before my meetings and enjoy the cooler air. At least it was enjoyable until my neighbor turned out there two kids onto their adjoining balcony. I glanced over and discovered that they were just sitting there staring at me...my guess is the parents stuck them out there so they could have some \"alone time\" in the room? HA, The hallways were divided by large stairways and atriums so there wasn;t that Vegas huge long hallway vibe. I think this contributed to it being very quiet at night. There is a bar in the hotel lobby that plays live music at night outside on a patio. Unfortunately the patio was close to my room so it sounded like a live concert up in my room til after 10PM. The ballrooms were a decent walk from the rooms but certainly not excessive. The meeting rooms were well appointed and even those usually boring banquet meals were all very tasty and enjoyable. We tried two of the hotel restaurants, The Blue Sage, which was more like a big coffee shop and Roy's. Roy's was outstanding but quite pricey. Good for an expense account or special occaision but definitely not everyday vittles. There is a huge outdoor shopping complex called Dessert Ridge across the street from the hotel with tons of restaurants and another complex just down the street with many upscale eateries. We tried 25degrees there and it was outstanding. Gourmet burgers and excellent appetizers. The pool area was just outstanding. There was a long lazy river and then about 4-5 other pools scattered about. There were tons of chairs and many water stations. Everyone grabbed the complimentary tubes and cruised along with their margaritas and pina coladas. It was just wonderful. The landscaping was inpeccable and the terrain went on and on with golf course and the hotel grounds. It was so much greener than I thought the desert could be. The sound of running water was everywhere with water features of all varieties scattered around. Every single hotel associate I came into contact with was smiling and friendly. I don't know if this had to do with the economy and them being so grateful to have any job or if perhaps they had the opportunity to hire a higher calibre of employee because of it. Regardless they all went out of their way to be extra nice and helpful. Was this the most spectacular hotel out there, no, but this whole experience ranked right up there as being among the most pleasant I have had.", "Date": "July 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGreat Customer Service!\u201d", "Author": "SoBeGirlNewJersey", "ReviewID": "UR34386426", "Content": "We just got back from a 5 night stay at this property.

The whole staff at the property was extremely hospitable from the valet attendants, front desk staff, bell staff and servers. We did get upgraded to a suite because of my husband's Marriott status which was beautiful. The room was very clean and had 2 balconies, bar area, dining room and huge bathroom. It was very comfortable. We did opt for a daily Resort Fee of $25 which gave our kids free breakfast, lunch and dinner in the Blue Sage, internet access, free parking, complimentary spa / fitness club access, etc. Very useful considering our kids ate about $35 each morning at the buffet. Pool was very busy and you had to get a chair before 10am or else you wouldn't have a place to sit. LOTS of kids! Loved the Lazy River the best. Great Nickolodean activities for kids which they loved. I love the spa! My sister and I had a massage and it was very relaxing and also lunch in the cafe. Excellent service and great food!

It is a beautiful large resort with all the amenities. We were given a very quiet room, although it overlooked an acre of roof. The room, bath, cleanliness was all very good. We spent one afternoon at the outdoor pool area. It was what we expected - lots of noise and young families. I had one little boy cannonball me while his mother watched and said nothing. They had the entire pool but chose to douse the few adults talking. The resort planned this area well because all the water falls really drown out a lot of the worst noise. That evening we dined at Ristorante Tuscany and it was by far the finest meal of the week including our excellent service. It was a very expensive dinner but I would highly recommend this restaurant. The next day we planned to spend the entire day at the spa pool and then have a massage in the afternoon. This is a beautiful spa and we were very impressed when we first arrived. That soon changed. In spite of many signs placed in the spa and outside at the pool stating no cell phone use, no smoking, etc. people were just coming to the spa to make their cell phone calls at the outdoor tables. Women were chatting on their cell phones in the locker room, and people were loudly conducting business all around the pool. One young women was on her phone the entire afternoon. The spa is also nonsmoking yet one young man found a lounge chair outside the locker room and smoked away. You could smell it in the pool area. The final straw was a young mother and grandmother rolling in her baby with stroller, etc. to camp out at one end of the pool. The spa states that it is for adults and children over 16. Another young mother not using the spa brought her 6 year old son to the outdoor spa cafe so she could talk on her cell and let him run around. Why have rules if they mean nothing? This is not an adult spa and it was not relaxing. The waiters will not say anything for fear of losing tips. We changed our plans for massages knowing that tranquility is not a priority here. The next morning were were charged an extra resort fee for each day even though we were on a package and did not use the internet or parking. They said they had taken it off only to find they had not when we returned home. Nothing earth shattering, but nevertheless an annoyance that takes time to correct. If you have small children and like a loud noisy resort this is for you. If you like a first rate spa experience I would look elsewhere for these prices. Also, if you need to get to the Phoenix airport they do not have any reasonable transportation provided by Marriott.

The question I was asked was \"did you try the remote?\". Wow. About 30 minutes later, a maintenance man appeared and was mystified because he couldn't decrease the volume either, so he called in assistance. It could not be repaired, so we were moved to another room--this was about 1 1/2 hours after we had checked in (for only one night). The next room was exactly the same, and the TV worked. I went into the restroom to use splash water on my face and almost overflowed the sink because the stopper was broken and plugged the sink. I had to reach in to dig the stopper out, and didn't bother asking for it to be fixed because our time had already been wasted some. There are no vending machines on the property, which was an issue for us because my husband is diabetic and sometimes needs a quick soda if his sugar levels drop suddenly. **The last problem we did not discover until we were already home--when checking in we were asked for a card for any incidental expenses, which we are accustomed to, and my husband gave his debit card--now, normally we would use a credit card, but staying only 1 night we knew we would have no additional expenses. Checking our bank statement, a $210 charge was debited at the exact same time we checked into this establishment. Our room rate was only $161 plus taxes (government rate)! I called the hotel Saturday, and they said they could offer no help, it would have to wait until Monday and a separate billing department would be able to assist me. I did call them Monday, and was told by a representative that it was a \"hold\" placed on the funds (which renders them completely frozen until Marriott calls the bank to have them released). That's all fine and good, but we were not told that any amount would be frozen by the check-in girl, and we travel frequently and are used to giving a card for incidentals, which we normally never accrue. Our 1st 2 nights in Scotsdale we stayed at a lower star Marriott and this one could use some tips to earn its higher star rating. As stated by others, the housekeeping staff did not acknowledge us at all when we walked by, and we always make a point to speak to housekeeping in the hotels we use. We would never consider staying here again, much to our disappointment.

My guess is that the previous reviews about unfriendly staff had to do with English not being these people's first languages. The lazy river was surprisingly entertaining. We thought we would get bored going around and around but it was very relaxing -- a combination of people watching and going on a car ride. The rest of the pool complex had a little something for everybody. Even if I had a two-year-old and our elderly parents with us, there would have been pool stuff to enjoy for everybody. Our biggest complaint was the fees. The $13 fee for internet access is ridiculous, as is the $22 fee for valet parking, the $20 fee for access to the Revive Spa fitness center, the $20 for access to the golf driving range, the $20 access to the tennis facilities, etc. The parking lots are pretty far from the hotel and in the summer heat, it is not a pleasant walk. Why is it that at the lower end Marriott (Fairfield Inns), you get free breakfast and internet access but as you move up the price range all the freebies disappear? If you're shelling out a few hundred a night for accommodation the least they can give you is a free breakfast and internet access. Any management types listening?

Really Wanted to Like it ... But...\u201d", "Author": "dreampilot", "ReviewID": "UR18081477", "Content": "We stayed here in mid July for six nights and seven days, four of those days attending a convention at the resort. We have a lot of mixed feelings and I have to say that if it wasn't for the great rate we got (nearly 70% off rack) because of our convention, we probably would rate this stay a lot lower. First the good... 1. Location: It is convenient to the Desert Ridge marketplace, a full service mall including a 20 screen movie theater and dozens of restaurants. The Resort runs a shuttle every 15 minutes or so to the mall. If you have a rental car - it's location is very convenient to Phoenix's highway system and downtown is only 20 minutes away. 2. Grounds/Atmosphere: well kept - and you can't beat the bunny brigade as we called it. In the late afternoons, dozens of rabbits plop on the green grass and stretch out - it's an almost surreal experience which is fun for young and old alike. There is a lot of grounds to explore... Although I have to say Orlando's JW Marriott's lazy river is much more fun, there are at least more pools to choose from. The slide would be more fun if it wasn't turned off so early 3. Rooms: Pretty typical for Marriott - which still has the best beds of most any hotel in it's tier. Bathrooms are nice and the flat screens come with full computer interface to hook up your laptops too. Patios in every room are a nice touch and big enough to host 4 friends relaxing. 4. Front Desk Staff, Concierge, housekeeping and Parking Staff were great folks and easy to talk to and represented the Marriott brand well Now the not so good... 1. Service: Outside of the folks mentioned in #4 above, We were extremely disappointed in the service by the other staff. We had better experiences with service at Motel 6 and other budget brands then some of the people we ran into here at this JW. The lounge and bar staff were completely rude, hard to get a hold of and just not very pleasant people to deal with. Our waiter at Roys and one of our waiters at the Blue Sage were the rare exception to the restaurant staff as well. If I ever stay here again - I would much rather take a shuttle to Desert Ridge Marketplace and eat over there than waste any more money at the Resort restaurants and their rude service.. 2. Speaking of staff - the lack of friendliness at the pools by staff was also very noticeable - and quite honestly for what we're paying (if it was normal rack) - we would expect a few more options poolside for drinks and snacks similar to how Orlando's JW resort runs. 3. If you like the all in one contained resort experience, I suppose you will like the entertainment options (2 golf courses, spa, etc) available - but we made more trips into Phoenix than the average guest because quite frankly, these resorts can get boring and drain your pocketbook dry. So maybe in all fairness this complaint isn't fair to direct at this JW specifically - but imo, if you plan to stay a few days here consider renting a car (AT THE AIRPORT - NOT THE RESORT - YOU\"LL SAVE LOTS OF MONEY) and exploring the area more. I am not overly picky about service but the consistent attitude and not so hot service we received from the lounge, restaurant and other staff here reduced our rating a whole \"star\" alone. Anyway - We would recommend this resort if you get a great deal but if you're paying full rate - you'd be much better off perhaps at another one of the many, many resort properties in the area.", "Date": "July 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bahamas", "Title": "\u201cNo \"Green\" in the desert!\u201d", "Author": "melodyheard", "ReviewID": "UR17889494", "Content": "The staff was friendly, the resort itself is beautiful, the spa was nice, nothing spectacular and the breakfast was good.

We wanted to bring our 2 of our children to a resort with some water features. When we checked in I presented two $500 gift cards to put on our tab. I knew we would spend more than that and they need to be processed. The girl told us it would be more convenient to run them at check out. What she meant was it would be more convenient for her as they take some time to process. It was off putting to be turned down for payment up front. Also, I have used thousands of dollars of these in Marriotts across the country and have been greeted much more graciously. One of the reasons we booked this hotel was for the lazy river and slide for our kids. The pools and grounds are gorgeous. We called before our trip and were told that the lazy river and slide were open until 7;00pm both nights so we booked it. However, both nights the river and slide stopped at 6:00 even though the signs posted said 7;00. Of course, the young people working the water area leave like robots as soon as it stopped flowing and couldn't answer any questions. We were later told that the features are on timer and a supervisor did not reset it. Our suite was $400 a night and there are many nice resorts in the Phoenix area with water features and better rates who are much more alert. It felt like the staff is less on top of things because there are fewer guests. Andrea at the front desk credited us $50 for the inconvience but the experience was not optimal. On the plus side, our two room suite beautiful. The fabric and features are relaxing,upscale and the new LCD tv's were great. Another detail that fell through the cracks was the air conditioning in our suite. The kids side with the sleeper sofa was great, but our room with the king never cooled down(we set it at 60 but it was about 78) and it never went off the whole 3 days we were there. Again, management needs to pay more attention to the details. The Blue Sage restaurant on the property was great and the kids loved it. Our second night we left the pool and wanted to eat at Roys. They would not seat us because we were in our suits and cover ups. I could understand this during convention season in Phoenix. However, when it is 111 degrees, your restaurant is almost empty and there are only 2 resturants on the property that are open, it should be adjusted for the season. Again, property management should close for the summer or pay attention. Our general feeling is that this is a great corporate hotel in a beautiful setting.

Nearly every person we talked to, whether it was at different restaurants, outside, at the front desk etc. seemed genuinely happy and more than willing to answer any questions we had. Many members of the staff seemed to go out of there way to help. From the moment we got there, the staff outside were Very friendly. The first thing we did was eat lunch at an outside cafe and the waiter we had was Very nice. Later we had dinner and sat outside on the patio and listened to live music and our waitress was extremely nice and helpful. Another day, we went to the kid's play room that they have and the young woman there was one of the friendliest people I have ever met. Another day, we didn't get our roomed cleaned and someone came by to make sure we didn't need anything. We didn't, but it was nice that someone came by to ask. Another night, we had dinner at Roy's restaurant and the service was Excellent. We have a little one who has a few food restrictions due to allergies and they went out of their way to find her a dessert that she could eat (that came free with her meal) even after we told them it wasn't a big deal. Our little one loved the dessert! When we booked our vacation it came with a credit and room upgrade. The front desk was great at helping to make sure that we actually got these. The room was Great! We had a huge tub and stand up shower and a private balcony that we could sit on and listen to the live music each night. GREAT!!! We loved that. The entire resort was clean and the interior decorating throughout was beautiful. I appreciated all the of the details and decor everywhere. In your room you are also given a, \"What's going on today\" sheet that tells you everything you can participate in which is really nice. If I had to point out a few things that were not positive, there aren't many. There are many birds that fly around so there is a good number of bird droppings by the pool area and at least on the balcony that we had. But, you can walk around these. It doesn't take away at how beautiful the resort is and at how great the landscaping is. It's really beautiful. Although there is a lazy river, which is great fun and relaxing, if you have someone with you that cannot swim or isn't a strong swimmer, I wouldn't let them out of your sight. My husband, literally helped save a woman from drowning. She went up and down in and out of the water a couple times splashing around and when we realized she needed help, she had just went under water again and didn't resurface for many seconds with one hand sticking out of the water until my husband jumped in from the other side and got to her and pulled her out of the water. There was a lifeguard nearby, but I think she must not have seen her. Also, I think there are spots that the lifeguards cannot see and although the water isn't deep, it's moving and for someone who cannot swim well, it's easy to panic and slip which is what I think happened to this woman. Thankfully, she is ok. Also, I did have a couple drinks by the pool that were a little spendy that were not very good that I didn't finish, but then my husband and I both ordered a couple smoothies that we were delicious.

We had a fantastic time. We arrived at night and the hotel was beautifully lit. Upon entry the staff was very friendly and helpful. Walking to our room we were a little nervous as we had to walk to the back of the hotel and down the stairs. When we got into our room we were pleasantly surprised. The room was definitely one of the nicer rooms we have been in. Everything was very clean and updated. Our room had a small patio area that overlooked a water with a fountain. My husband is in sales and stays in hotel rooms across the country every week. He was impressed with the both the room and bathroom. The grounds of the hotel are spectacular. We found something new to explore every day we were there. We didn't find the pools to be too crowded. There are a variety of locations to sit at and enjoy the pools and waterfalls. We found the lazy river a nice place to sit near since it kept people moving by and not constantly splashing or yelling right in your face. There were also other locations through out the pool area that were quiet and relaxing just to sit and listen to the water falls. My husband is a Gold member and we had access to the spa fitness facility. Which was also very nice with ellipticals and tread mills with tv's attached as well as a variety of free weights and machines. The Desert Ridge mall is with in walking distance and offers a variety of great places to eat and shop. We at at Roy's one night which was fantastic. We had a lunch a few times at the pool and the staff was very accommodating. We had a great time seeing the wild life too. We made friends with a duck, got to see a nest of great horned owls at the spa and saw a variety of birds and bunnies. I was a bit nervous after reading some of the reviews. I do have to say some of them are a bit critical. My husband stays at various hotels across the U.S. every week. And he was very impressed with the grounds, room and service here. He pointed out that rarely does he find a hotel that has free internet access, few that have rooms that are as nice as these, and very few that have bathrooms as nice as this.

We arrived early Friday evening after a long day that had started 12 hours earlier; starting in Flagstaff, moving on to a fabulous day at the Grand Canyon and surrounding areas. Needless to say, we didn\u2019t look exactly \u201cspiffy\u201d as we tumbled, crumpled and hike-weary out the large but not upscale rental car. As my husband snaked around the crowded arrival area I spied many immaculate, beautifully dressed \u201cshiny\u201d people coming and going from the lobby, I took a deep breath and as we trod upon the premises we were treated\u2026\u2026\u2026 WELL by the valet, bell captain, and assorted staff in the lobby. I had carefully read the room descriptions prior to making reservations. As any family of FIVE knows, it is a challenge making reservations for one room. However this time, I didn\u2019t have to forget, oop\u2019s, a family member and make it an even four to get a room, as rooms were noted as having a max of five with two queen beds and a sleeper sofa. We opted for the up-grade with the view. It wasn\u2019t planned as a long stay, just a little nice R&R after all the traveling, with a fun pool for the kids and admittedly \u201clovely\u201d grounds for the parents, so no worries for mom. Check in was fine, again courteous enough, etc. except I was advised no sleeper sofa. My third grader is small enough (we did it at Disney) so I figured no big deal, sleep on sofa as sofa vs sofa bed. BUT when we got to our room --two double beds (!!!) and NO sofa. The music was vibrant and clearly lively outside our balcony over-looking the pool. One person\u2019s \u201cparty\u201d is another mom\u2019s nightmare. I was not OK with the set up. When we asked for a cot, it took up so much space that other furniture needed to be removed. Another deep breath, and I marched to front desk looked for the person who seemed to be in charge and politely advised, NOT OK. Francesca (sp?) was very attentive and immediately got busy trying to find another room. I also offered to, happily, forgo the up-graded view to look out at a wall gain a sofa, and call it even. No exchange rooms were available\u2026\u2026BUT undaunted Francesca kept working it. She offered some sort of penthouse (??!!) room with a dining table for six, and a murphey bed, my eyes started spinning in their sockets (no explanation needed for other moms) then she found it. The executive suite. One King (as if the 3rd grader doesn\u2019t end up in bed with us anyway) and a sleeper sofa in the other room for the two middle schoolers. Perfection !!!!!! The room(s) were large, lovely (by any standards\u2026.Belagio, Wynn, Beverly Hills Hotel for recent comparison) quiet, and the view the next morning, one for mental memory books. I advised Francesa that I was not looking for a freebie or a hand-out and she politely scoffed at the thought of anything other than an even exchange. Kevin Costner (in town for a charity event), quietly singing and playing the guitar under my balcony the next morning was an added bonus for mom (and yes, super handsome, !!! etc, in real life).

This is my second stay at this hotel, last was 2 years ago for 3 nights. First, let me say I am a Gold Member of the Rewards program and am a loyal patron. That being said, I was dissapointed not to be treated like one. One week before check-in I requested a room overlooking the Desert Botanical Garden. I did this knowing that the rooms facing the pool are quite loud at times. I was told I had an \"upgraded view room\". Upon check-in I was given a room with \"two over-sized Queens\" according to the front desk. Queens?? These are full beds and I am with my wife of nearly 15 years on vacation. Possibly we could have a King bed? Oh yes, and the room is on the 2nd floor overlooking...the pool. I called front desk immediately to let them know this was not satisfactory. They took my cell number and told me they would call when they had another room available. The time marched on until about 3:30. At this point, I was concerned they would have filled their rooms. I went to the front desk and found they only had 2 rooms left in the hotel. Unreal. They were a King on ground floor (I always request high floors, but apparently having that information in your Elite reservation status is just for one's own personal information) and another double/double room overlooking the Botanical Garden. I took the double/double begrudgingly as it least it had a decent view. By the way, no offer to help move my luggage...nice touch. Room we finally setlled in was standard for the resort. Nice view of mountains, botanical garden and....720 people from Bacardi on two mornings having breakfast. Now I dont begrudge the hotel for making money on corporate events, but they need a better system to make those on vacation not feel inconvenienced by these events. My inconvenience came at 3:30 AM on my 2nd night there when the staff started setting up the buffets, etc. Having come to AZ for the weather, I had my sliding glass door open. Ahhhh, the relaxing sounds of golf carts backing up (beep, beep, beeep) and rattling dishes, clanking glasses. Now, every day you get a sheet in your room with activities for the resort. Basically, this doesn't change form day to day. My suggestion? Put the events and location of events on their as a \"heads-up\" to the vacationing resort guests so they know if they should keep their door shut so as not to be awoken at 3:30 AM. Another thought, work it out with the corporation to give those in rooms overlooking their event a small gift. It would go a long way. Lastly, let's talk about litter. The grounds are mainly immaculate. This ends in the common areas outside, especially at the pools (SPA pool is worth the money). I know there are a huge number of people that traffic these areas, but the resort doesn't seem to know this. They need many more staff to clean up througout the day. Cups, straws, etc were everywhere. Part of the blame lay on the guests. Some of whom didn't make any effort to clean up after themselves. On the other hand, I shouldn't be swimming in a pool with empty cups at the bottom (at least 1 every day I was there). Also, as I was walking back to my room after a day at the pool and I noticed something striking. There was a sugar packet on the lawn as well as a piece of plastic. I saw 2 Marriott employees, one was dressed as a manager. I thought this will be interesting to see if they stop to pick up this trash. The answer? They walked right by. Marriott, train your employees to have pride in the resort surroundings. This is unacceptable. One last piece of advice: get some new chaise lounges out at the main pool. A number of them look like you got them from a garage sale. People are paying over $500 a night at this time of year for chairs like this? The lounges at the Spa should be standard for this kind of high-end resort.", "Date": "April 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, MN", "Title": "\u201cGet A Discount or try elsewhere\u201d", "Author": "wamu", "ReviewID": "UR15192074", "Content": "We stayed at the JW Marriott for three nights in April - it is a fairly new site and you could definately tell.

This upset him and he refused to go on the slide again with \"the mean lady\" working there. I talked to the manager of the pool area and he said he would address it.

Great location but will not travel in March it is Spring Break and no matter where you travel whether beach or ski there will be plenty of kids about. I was suprised no one mentioned the vacation club time shares. Do not show interest when traveling past the time share desks because I did and not only had 3 separate voicemail messages on my room phone but also had a flyer put on my door so unless you are truly interested in their 90 min presentation steer clear. This hotel is located across from Desert Ridge Marketplace one of the cleanest outside shopping malls I have visited, it is not high end stores but has most everything moderate and they do provide a shuttle pick up from Desert Ridge. The rooms are some of the cleanest and the housekeeping staff very friendly. The pools were crowded due to the month of travel but there are several and they do clear out at 5:00 pm and since it is still very nice outside that is a great time for adults to attend. The restaurants are priced average for a hotel in this category. The room service prices are steep for breakfast so we went across to Mimi's or Paradise Bakery. Be prepared to walk alot, if you like to be near the pool or golf please ask to be near those areas. The nightly turndown service provides a schedule of activities for the next day, this is the first time I have seen a Segway tour offered.

Since we had an early morning flight, we had requested early check-in in advance. We knew it might or might not be available but we were happy to learn on arrival that our room was ready and it was only a little past 9:00 a.m. We had also requested a high floor in advance and we were given a room on the 5th floor (top floor) that overlooked the lagoon, golf course and mountains in the distance - very quiet and relaxing on the balcony. The room was spacious and nicely decorated. I have read other reviews complaining about the size of the room. We had a \"regular\" king room and there was a desk and chair, loveseat, coffee table, armoire and still plenty of room. I peeked in a room with 2 queens (or doubles) and it looked a little more cramped. So if a king bed suits your needs, you will find it more spacious. The bathroom was huge - separate tub and shower and large vanity. The staff went out of their way to be friendly and accommodating. The concierge made three dinner reservations for us, gave advice on activities we might enjoy, and printed out our boarding passes on the day of our check-out . Breakfast at the Blue Sage was great - good food and fast service - we ate outdoors each morning. We did not eat any other meals at the hotel so can't comment on that. Even though the hotel was full, the only place that seemed crowded was at the pool. It was somewhat of a chore to find a chair each day. Lots of chair-saving going on, even though the hotel says this is against their policy. However, the beverage service at the pool was fine. I forgot my pool wrist bracelet twice but this was not a problem - I had my room key and was not asked to go back to get the bracelet. I appreciate the staff's diligence in keeping outsiders out of the pool in order to keep it available for guests - this is common practice at other nice resorts. The spa was a real treat! It was expensive but in line with what other spas charge. I think when you travel at spring break, it takes a good attitude to have a great time and enjoy your vacation.

We trust that Marriott will ensure that convention business doesn't overwhelm the hotel and interfer with the guests paying their own way who expect to have access to the facilities at their convenience without being subjected to noise and overcrowding (if you think it might be a problem it might be wise to call and see what they have booked at the time you plan to be there ).]", "Date": "February 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Jersey", "Title": "\u201cClassy Place\u201d", "Author": "Gracie27", "ReviewID": "UR13683459", "Content": "We went out to Phoenix for a girls spa trip from 2/15 through 2/18-just a quick weekend getaway. This hotel was wonderful-the grounds are beautiful, the staff is so helpful, the spa was one of the nicest I have ever been to, and the food was excellent. I will say they definetely focus on their conventions and it is a great resort for golfers...if you are looking to experience downtown Phoenix, I wouldn't recommend this place but for a nice, relaxing trip, convention, or golf outing, its perfect. We spent a lot of time across the street at the Desert Ridge Marketplace, eating and shopping and the Resort offers a complimentary shuttle service back and forth as well. Our room was on the top floor overlooking the front of the hotel-it was the perfect size for the three of us. And honestly the only complaint i have was that during the evening you could hear the \"lobby\" band playing from our room because the main hotel is set up like an atrium so many rooms overlook the lobby and noise carries, but we just put the tv on and went to sleep and it stopped at a decent hour, so it really wasn't a pain. The hotel was beautiful, I loved how they have the fruited water all over the place and they gave you a free starbucks coffee coupon every morning. They had nature walks along the trails and the fitness center was very nice (no one was really there). Besides the spa cafe, we did not eat at any of the restaurants in the hotel so I cannot comment on them.

I am a self-described hotel snob and I was pleasantly surprised by how wonderful the resort was. The rooms were very clean & restocked with towels twice daily (morning & turn-down service). It was quite expansive, but just enough to feel like you had your own space. There were many little nooks where you could curl up with a book or take a nap in the sun & no one would know or care that you were there. The lobby had a nice bar & plenty of couches & tables to play card games on well into the night. There was live music every night - my only complaint is that they should have played later than 10 PM! I would recommend the Starbucks or Blue Sage Marketplace for breakfast. Although you are still going to pay $2 for a cookie, they are the only \"munchie\" place in the hotel. If you like healthy food eat at the Spa Bistro. It is open to everyone even if you don't use the spa. The food was very good & quite refreshing - - $9 for a \"healthy\" hamburger, not bad. We did eat at the Blue Sage restaurant for dinner & was not too happy with the service. All the other restaurants in the hotel were a bit out of our price range. I would recommend the Desert Ridge Marketplace across the street (nice walk, or catch the shuttle every 1/2 hour from the hotel). Although, it may look like a mall, there are not that many shops, but there are plenty of restaurants! We at at the Yard House. If you like beers, they have 84 on tap!!! They even put on our Packers for one of the football games! All in all, this would be my 1st pick of hotels if I was ever back in Phoenix. Contrary to some of the reviews on here (that had me a bit nervous before I went), this hotel is not business/conference centered.

There are several options around if someone does not want to eat there. My only comment is although the service at the Meritage Steakhouse (at the golf club) was good, the food wasn\u2019t the best (it was good but certainly not in the region of the cost) try instead Capital Grille - Scottsdale or Ruth's Chris Steak House - Phoenix.

Upon arrival, we checked in and were given a room on the 6th floor overlooking the botanical gardens, golf course and distant mountains. There was a small table and two chairs on the balcony. The room was clean and we had plenty of towels for our use. The shower stall tiles were a bit slippery and uneven. The beds were comfy and we had our choice of four pillows, two each of foam and feather. The ice machine was down the hall in an enclosed area and the free laundy (including detergent) was on the 4th floor. The only suggestion I would have is a screen for the sliding glass door. Coming from New England, I would have loved to keep the screen door closed and let the desert breeze in during the night. Staff in both the shops and restaurants were accommodating and gracious.

We bought a case of water at CVS for the cost of a bottle at the Marriott. The grounds are beautiful and the lazy river was relaxing.

It made it hard to feel relaxed with all those corporate badges and people always doing business. The hotel definitely caters to this and these people get the better service. They being the business people also look at you like what are you doing bringing your small children here to vacation? What made a difference in our stay was that they do have a nice lazy river for children with a slide and my boys also enjoyed the basketball nets at the other pools. Also, we ate at Roy's on our final night and they truly were wonderful! Kudos to their staff and their food was excellent. Thank you Roy's for letting us end the trip on a remarkable note! Be aware also that this is supposed to be a JW and the linens are not the best. Although, the room was clean the linens were awful (most of the towels were not very white but dingy gray and the bed sheets were worn with even little tears). We went to the breakfast at Blue Sage one morning...I was very irritated that the table was not clean and that the chairs were not wiped . The booster seat they gave my daughter was disgusting also. I hate to be picky but you can get this at an IHOP......and this is a JW! Do yourself a favor and if you are a family try the Camelback they are so much more service oriented and it has a much better feel for families. We have stayed at alot of Marriott's top resorts and also Ritz's and we were a little disappointed with this one. We will definitely go back to the Camelback with our next travels to the Phoenix/Scottsdale area and by the way, if your travels take you to Sedona don't hesitate to stay at the Enchantment /Mii Spa Resort this is truly a fantastic resort and you will be amazed at the views!!", "Date": "October 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh", "Title": "\u201cExcellent once again\u201d", "Author": "kayleigh_k", "ReviewID": "UR8711599", "Content": "Never fails to deliver each time I have stayed.

My only complaint is that a hotel of this size should have more than two computers in the business center, which was run by FedEx Kinko's. At 40 cents a minute, surely they'd recover the cost in a month. While the gift shop is terrific, I think they can expand the business center a little into the gift shop and add a computer or two.

The hotel and rooms were beautiful. We had a room with 2 double beds, and while not huge, it was comfortably sized, and the bathroom is spacious and nicely appointed. The beds were very comfortable, and even with the soaring temperatures, the air conditioning worked well and was pretty quiet. This hotel has over 900 rooms, so you can imagine how large it is. We chose to self-park, not to save money but because I like the convenience of coming and going on a whim, being able to access things stored in the car, etc. The only problem with the free self-parking is that there are not adequate spaces, and you have to walk probably 1/4 to 1/2 a mile from the parking lots to the hotel. By the time you reach the lobby, you are practically suffering from heat exhaustion! Fortunately they have dispensers of cold water and iced tea in the lobby area.

It's not a big deal to be in this category (only requires 10 nights per year or that you have a Marriott Visa card!) The letter said we could visit the Marriott Canyon Villas desk in the lobby to receive a deluxe postcard set. Of course, they want to sell you a membership in these timeshares. We also received a scratch-off \"lottery\" ticket upon check-in, that had to be scratched at the, guess where, Canyon Villas desk to see if you won some Marriott points. The icing on the cake was the recorded message we received on our last day, thanking us for staying with them. I thought \"what a nice touch\" until I kept listening to the message, which went on to offer us a great rate on a return visit ... of course you must book this through the Canyon Villas to see if you're eligible, etc! They just couldn't give up that last opportunity to try and sell something. Would definitely have been nicer if they had just thanked us for our patronage ... period!

After reviewing this property online, and knowing Marriott's trademark of exceptional service we were looking forward to our 5 day stay at this fairly new property. Both couples stayed in Standard King rooms at $549 per night. Upon Thursday afternoon check in, our room was on the 3rd floor, directly above the main driveway/valet enterence. With this rate, the noise and traffic which included 3 buses were a surprise. The bellboy was assuring us these were the last bus arrivals for the day. As he spoke, 2 more could be seen approaching. Our request for another room was not immediately remedied, but an hour later we were told we could move, but we would be very far from each other. We still agreed after realizing the distance was most extreme! There are 950 rooms here so we were off to Egypt on our own, no offer of assistance. We laughed this off as glad to have the opportunity to be removed from the driveway noise and fumes. Later we met our friends in the huge and most beautiful lobby and waited forever on the patio to be acknowledged and served drinks. We decided to move inside and found a spot near the bar so our husbands could serve us rather than die on the vine. The people watching was fabulous tho- Obviously lots going on. A reception was queing up before entering their poolside designation. We noticed an entire outdoor common area had been roped off- and this was the beginning of how things were going to go - removing pool areas, lawn areas, patio areas for convention meals, receptions, MLB club members and special events. The \"vacationer's\" space got smaller and smaller as the weekend proceeded. All the pool's furniture filled up in the early morning either with bodies or \"saved\" with books and towels. Poolside service was very stressed, and there were long waits to order- and to receive orders. We watched as other guests lost patience and learned that the management had no time for regular duties as they followed up with personal apologies. I have no idea why they were so short-staffed, as the complex is designed to serve the masses. Perhaps that is the downfall, as the staff did not seem to enjoy or handle their positions under stress and there is no excuse for runnng it understaffed. We dined at Tuscany, it was fabulous and here the staff knew how to treat and please their guests and allowed us to feel like we were in Europe where it is impolite to hurry the guest along or present an unrequested check. This was our favorite meal of the entire trip! Roy's was a great environment, on patio outside. The food was also good but you will have to pay to get any amount of it, salads and accompaniments are separate. Their location is more visual to the \"hotel masses\" and here we knew that our table was \"scheduled\" for another reservation behind us. Reservations are a must, suggest later dining to avoid being rushed. The onsite Starbuck's had huge lines all mornings and usually ran out of breakfast items and popular ingredients before we got up. The hotel was full the entire time we were there, not just the weekend. We went to the spa on 2 different days: peds and manis on one visit, maggages the other. Never have we paid more for salon services, but were happy to have the use of the spa included which isn't always the norm for pedi/mani services. The massages were excellent but construction was underway next to the pool, tractors and alot of dirt and dust aloft along with the noise. There are many spas in the Phoenix area and this one dosen't come close to the atmosphere or relaxation available at JW Marriott's Camelback Inn - there is where you will find spa bliss! Our husbands golfed on site - very expensive for the quality - they are used to the Trune courses in Arizona and there is no comparrison except in fees. We were certainly paying enough and know what the resort experience should be. After a few days of not being treated as JW Marriott guest's reputation holds, we managed to get rooms in JW's nearby \"real resort\" Camelback Inn. This property is much older and smaller - but if you are expecting service and an relaxing atmosphere you will be treated as the most important guest that you deserve to be and would expect when staying at a resort. The Desert Ridge is a Convention Complex. All the amenities are a huge bonus and a great addition to the convention experience, resulting in positive reviews from the business traveler, and a huge dissappointment to the vacationeer! I shouldn't close without mentioning the middle of the night fire drill. The continued blaring sirens emptied bathrobed guests into hallways. I felt horrible for the parents of wailing children but the worst of it was that there was no communication. Remember, our rooms were at the farthest point, Egypt, and it was a hike with and without use of elevators towards the lobby. Since this turned out to be a false alarm it was unfortunate that staff did not send runners or use the PA system to explain the situation. They did record and deliver a phone message hours later that blamed the incident on a guest, suggesting that he was drunk in the bar and pulled down on an alarm. I don't like to quote over used phrases, but when we left the Desert Ridge I said to my friend, \"Been here, Done that, Won't be back.\"", "Date": "June 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel\u201d", "Author": "StarBellySneetch", "ReviewID": "UR7762044", "Content": "When we arrived at the hotel, we noticed that the parking lot was located kind of far away, but decided to just deal with it and make the long treck to our room.

Having kids, this is a plus. The pool was great and is where we spent most of our time. Being 100 plus degrees outside there were plenty of umbrellas (we had no problem finding chairs w/ an umbrella in the morning, however, it did get crowded by late morning). Also, there were staff members handing out pitchers of ice water and popsicles throughout the day. The food you can order at the pool was good and the service was quick. There is also a great kid's menu (we were not given the kid's menu and had to request it). There were a lot of activities at the hotel during our stay including a movie shown by the pool every night, a cowboy camp night with s'mores and a native american family who performed traditional dances. The fitness center could be a little bigger. If you want to go on the treadmill or do weight machines it's not a problem. If you do mat work or free weights, first of all there are no mats and secondly there is very limited space to work out. The Desert Ridge Marketplace nearby has something for everyone. There are several restaurants including California Pizza Kitchen, Rock Bottom Brewery, the Yardhouse and Macaroni Grill. Great restaurants for kids. There is also a movie theater and the outdoor mall had a lot of your typical mall stores.

While my husband attended meetings I floated in a tube in the lazy river pool (and I was certainly not the only adult in the lazy river pool). This property is absolutely stunning, gorgeous grounds, tastefully decorated rooms and a bathroom I wish I had in my own home (marble, granite and travertine). The beds were comfy, though I would have preferred firmer pillows. Neither my husband nor I found the hotel staff to be snotty or rude as another reviewer mentioned. Everyone we encountered was helpful and friendly. The concierge even gave us a much better suggestion for transportation back to the airport (and made the reservation for us as well) than what we were originally planning to do. We took SuperShuttle from PHX to the hotel for $19 p/p. A little time was wasted in making various stops within the airport to pick up more passengers and then having to stop at another hotel to drop someone off, but this is the nature of SuperShuttle. However, the driver was quite competent. But for our return to the airport we took TransStyle Limousine for $22 p/p. It's a town car that takes just 4 people. We were at the airport in 20 minutes. One other convenient (and free) perk was that you could print out your airline boarding passes at a computer in the lobby near the front desk. The computer only prints boarding passes, but for about 20 airlines. We appreciated this convenience. Food at the hotel: the restaurants are pricey, as one would expect them to be at an upscale property. My husband brought me breakfast from the spread at his meeting, but I did have lunch at the pool one day. I thought the prices were reasonable ($12 for a very large and filling spinach salad and $5 for a smoothie). I had seen other people's orders and knew, before I ordered my lunch, that the portions were plentiful. For dinner we took the complimentary shuttle to the Desert Ridge shopping/dining/entertainment complex across the street from the property (the property is large and also encompasses the Marriott Vacation Club, so the shuttle is necessary). There were many good dining choices with many price ranges at Desert Ridge. My only disappointment was some of the equipment in the fitness center. My husband and I are both gym rats, and we both love the elliptical trainer. Some are better than others and the ones at this Marriott were not good at all. Very awkward and uncomfortable to use, so ended up running on the treadmills (which were quite good and had personal TV's with complimentary earphones). Though we were here for a short conference, I would definitely consider returning for a long weekend sometime, perhaps even a sisters/girlfriends trip.

We have another room it is on a different floor,\" and the exhausted and exasperated guy says, \"Fine,\" and the next scene is him walking into the type of suite in \"Ocean's Twelve\"? You know the kind of suite you picture Julia Roberts getting? Weeeeellllll.... That's not exactly what happened to us. Okay, that's exactly what happened. We got the most pimped out suite I had ever seen! We really did not expect much because we had gotten a time share presentation invitation from Northwest WorldPerks. My wife and I were considering a timeshare, and maybe a temporary relocation to the PHX area for a year (while a friend rented our house from us, our jobs are in demand anywhere in the US, and thus our friend indirectly pays for PHX apartment), so we were intrigued, but we did not expect much for $75/night. Well it turned out after our \"Great AZ Road Trip,\" which I chronicled under my review of the Comfort Inn Camp Verde, I was actually prepared to pay big $$$ for an upgrade. After all it was our third anniversary and I wanted to live how the other half does, at least for a few days. Well did not have to shell out for the upgrade thanks to the large Honeywell conference that took about 99.4 percent of the hotel and bumped me into a suite. Now this was no ordinary suite... Noooooo. We walk into gleaming marble foyer, with the most detailed closet with ample drawer space and plush robes. On the left is the bathroom with: Double vanity; Everything you could think to need in little baskets underneath on the shelves; A completely marble tub and seperate marble shower big enough for two and surrounded by glass; Seperate powder room with a phone in it!!!!; And marble that goes 3/4 up all the walls. Go past the bathroom and into the room (that was at least two regular Marriott suites in one) and there was: A huge TV with a nice interactive menu hidden in the TV armoire; Two bookshelves with actual books I would want to read (of course JW Marriott's book was there as well); Two leather \"Lazy boy\" chairs; Leather couch: Solid wood desk with a computer and internet; Large dining/board room table with eight chairs; Large wet bar (about double the size of most hotel wet bars); Mini-fridge (always how you get in my book of favorites): Safe; And king-size Murphy Bed with memory foam mattress with soft white linens. The wife and I laughed ourselves silly for about two hours and called everyone we knew. Mind you we're on vacation and people are wondering why were calling them so late (PHX was three hours behind at that time because it was Indpls's first year on EDT.) Then we got scared that they might make us move, but that never happened. They probably wouldn't but we left our do not disturb sign out 24/7 just in case. I experienced nothing but first class service while there, but then again, I wasn't really trying to get much other than a tan and tall drink. Ate in the steak restaurant once and service was above average. Expensive pool side drinks, but convenient and very tasty... er, effective! Time share presentation was very pleasant until they told me that unless I write a check for $X,0000 right then, I'd have to finance through them to buy... and the interest is 14.9%! Are you kidding me?!?! I could've bought it at 0.9% on my MC right then, but they don't take plastic. Dumb. Killed it right there and we were going to buy one. He did give us a $100 Marriott certificate though - applied it to a free steak dinner in one of their five restaurants! I had a very good filet, but it's not Sullivans. Scenery is 2nd to none. Our room overlooked a courtyard full of wonderful vegetation. My wife enjoyed here morning strolls before it got above 90 degrees. If I was an advid golfer there is no way I would miss a few rounds out here. Especially since you can sometimes get the Jack Rabbits to go after your partners ball. The only way this place would be better is if it was in Sedona, but you wouldn't want this place there because it would make Sedona too commercialized. The hotel was full of people bt did not feel crowded. The main guests with the deep pockets were Honeywell, but unlike some of the other reviews, I did not feel ignored. Housekeeping to valet, to regular attendants were courteous and acknowledged me before I had even made eye contact sometimes. The gentlman working at FedEx Kinkos was gracious enough to waive the internet fee because I was just on for literally two minutes. I think it would cost him more in his time to ring up 78 cents. Parking is a nice walk across some HOT blacktop, but I will take 115 degree heat over Indiana winter anyday. Water is something that is sold everywhere here so you're thirst is not far from relief but make sure that you are drinking water BEFORE you are thirsty. A smart tip is to go the grocery store in the shopping area across from the resort and just get a twenty four case of water. You will even appreciate warm water when it's 115 Farenheit. Pools are exceptional, but get towels early or bring your own. When I was there they were asking for hotel keys for towels, which is smart because there seemed to be some locals there who probably are not paying for these amenities. The place is so large there is not much that staff could do to keep them out. Did not utilize the spa, but definitely considered it seriously. Did a lot of exploring of PHX. Old Town Scottsdale is great. They are still building around Scottsdale and the free bus service is great, especially if you want to find a free place to park and then ride around town to several points including Scottsdale's amazing mall! The only other place I though to compare is the mall near Waikiki, but Scottsdale's mall was indoors and Hawaii's mall outdoors. Lot's of great mom and pop restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale. Wanted to try them all! Overall, I had the most enchanting experience in PHX and the JW Marriott was the crowning jewel. I hope to go back several times over my lifetime. Maybe one day I will retire there at the ripe old age of 51. Hmmm... Early retirement plan...Maybe I could be Ocean's Thirteenth - Doh!

All of a sudden a man was standing over my child and I, motioning for us to leave. We had been in the spa reception area for all of 5 minutes!!! We were in the process of walking toward the door anyway. I wound up cancelling b/c I knew after being treated so rudely, I would not be able to \"revive\" there. Finally, the UGLY-and I mean UGLY: Beside shelling out a $$$$ money for the suite and joining room, we also decided to shell out even more for a passcard to the \"CLOUD ROOM\". They offered snacks, lite meals, drinks, web access, open bar. However, they just instituted a no kids allowed rule. That meant either parent having to go solo to the \"CLOUD \" while 8 yr old sat outside to help w/the carry out food; the other parent stayed in room w/other 2 kids. Never got to enjoy the view, or ambiance as advertised. Despite this, we understood and used our divide and conquer plan as mentioned above and were fine with it. Then there was the issue of me trying to take my totally asleep 2 yr old into the \"CLOUD\" room b/c my spouse w/other 2 kids were at the pool. I figured it would be ok since I was doing a quick snack run. I didn't think it was safe to leave her alone outside in the hall. Asleep toddler and I were 6 feet into the \"Cloud\" Room when \"on duty \" Cloud concierge person stopped me and tried to shoo me out b/c according to her, kids aren't allowed (though it is a family resort) and it's not fair to the other guests who can't bring their kids in. She spoke rather loudly, repeating herself and embarrassing me in front of the other 6-8 guests who were in there. Naturally I reacted and told her that it was ridiculous that I paid extra $$$ for the CLOUD Room, and that I couldn't stop in for 2 minutes to grab a few things to bring back to our rooms. Not once did she offer to stand outside the Cloud room and watch my baby for the 2 minutes it would have taken. As I was leaving she got infront of me pushing the Cloud Room door wide open, for all the guests to see-more humiliation for me, and said \"I'm a momma too\". I turned to her w/ baby in stroller and said \" That's not the point \" but I didnt get to finish what I was saying to her, b/c one of the male guests came charging to the door and told me I was making a scene. Of course all he could see was upsetment on my face responding to her, and not the continued snipping she was doing to me. I am 5'7\", and the Cloud Concierge person was easily 5' 9\" , and the guy who charged at me was atleast 6'5\" tall. It was intimidating and scary to have these taller people standing over me in such an aggressive manner. And they did this to me w/ my toddler by my side. I wound up in tears at the front desk as my 8 yr & 6 yr old children walked up w/ their dad. It was awful. I didn't want to leave our suite and room after that, it ruined the last day & half of my trip. It also upset my kids to see me crying.

Next morning for breakfast, the line and wait were longer (over half an hour, we were told) so we decided to try to snag breakfast at the Starbucks on the property.

The location is many miles north of downtown and most Phoenix-Scottsdale sites, although the 101 and 51 freeways help. You have to have a car to stay here unless you are willing to pay the high tab of cabs and exec cars. My wife and I are not golfers and we didn't do the spa, so we have no opinion on the Desert Ridge course or the spa.

Also ate at the Italian restaurant on property and it was OK and expensive. Breakfast buffett is expansive and expensive. Be prepared to have money fly out of your wallet for everything, but this is a high end, luxary resort in the desert and that is to be expected. The resort is big, 400 plus rooms so know that before you go. Also, it is located way out in n/e Phoenix on the border of north Scottsdale. Everything in this area is spread out. If you don't have a rental car, be prepared for a car service or taxi ride to Old Town Scottsdale costing between 50 and 60 dollars one way, plus tip. There are great bars and restaurants between the resort and downtown Scottsdale. Both Devil's Martini Bars were great. Dos Gringos was casual and fun and for a high end steakhouse (really high end), but absolutely fabulous for the food, decor and bar and people scene, try Drinkwater's City Hall Steakhouse in Old Town. From there you can walk to just about all the other bars and nighclubs. It was all good. Personally, I would have liked my resort to be about half the size of this one and half the distance to Old Town Scottsdale, but I was part of a golf group and it was not my call.

The pool is really a pool complex, with several different pools and hot tub. Although the hotel was fully booked, the pool never really seemed crowded. The Spa is enourmous and seemed extremely busy, but that did not take away from the experience in any way. The treatments, were expensive but wonderfully relaxing. The restaurants we tried were quite good. We ate most often at Blue Sage, which had a great breakfast menu including a impressive looking buffet that we did not get around to trying.

The front desk staff and all hotel staff we encountered were very pleasant and helpful. The concierge staff even created driving directions for us from point A to point B to point C and back to the hotel when we told them our tourist-y plan for my 1 free day!! We rented a car from the on-site Hertz place. We enjoyed the Frank Lloyd Wright camp tour, (Talieson West), old towne Scottsdale and Rawhide - the re-created old West town complete with fake shoot-outs. Hokey- yes, a little, but great fun and great photo opps! Looked like a movie scene. My husband and teen daughter had a great time on the Detours guided van tour to the Grand Canyon which also stopped at Sedona and a reservation and included lunch for $130. The concierge encouraged that tour group because of the cushier seats for the long drive up and back (4.5 hrs each way). There wer others that were cheaper, but I'm glad we booked this one - they got a great guide. My daughter was spouting off facts and info about plants, geology, etc for days afterwards. The hotel's free shuttle to the nearby Desert Ridge Marketplace ran every half hour or less and was very handy, since otherwise you'd need a car to get anywhere. (or go broke on taxis to get downtown) We ate most of our meals over there, since they had California Pizza Kitchen, TGI Fridays and other non-chain but similar places and the restaurants at the hotel looked expensive for our tastes.

The staff at this place were really great. Very kind and attentive and willing to do whatever it took to make our stay enjoyable. There was a woman who was checking in when we were checking in and it turned out she was at the wrong JW in Phoenix, so the front desk attendant arranged to have one of the resort's town cars take her to the correct hotel so she didn't have to pay for yet another taxi. That's what I call great service! We picked this hotel for three reasons: 1 - lazy river/pool complex; 2 - spa (for me); 3 - golf (for hubby). If we were attending a conference, I might have given this resort a higher rating, but as a leisure hotel, it is only okay (especially given the high price). 1. The lazy river/pool was great, but a little on the cool side and always dirty with bugs and debris swirling right around the loop with you. Pool bar/cafe food was what I've come to expect from pool bar food - expensive and mediocre. 2. The spa environment was wonderful. The facilities were beautiful, peaceful and serene and the staff was okay. The massage I received was probably the worst I've ever had, and at $150 for 50 minutes, I was hugely disappointed. 3. I'm not a golfer, but my husband was pretty disappointed with the course he played (there are two and one was closed - unfortnately I can't remember which one he played). I guess it's the wrong time of year for golf in PHX, but still, for the price he expected a lot better. Our room was nice; bedding was heavenly. Shower pressure was terrible and so I called the front desk. Within an hour, maintenance had come, removed the old shower head, located and installed a new one and the pressure was much better. There was a cockroach in our room the first morning, but it was clearly on its last leg and was the only bug of any kind we encountered in our ground floor room.

I have a very hard time sleeping in uncomfortable sheets, but the bed itself was very comfortable and had lots of pillows. The other issue I had was the way the A/C was set up. The vent was a large vertical space on the corner of one wall and only hit one bed, so one of us was hot all night and the other froze. I was glad for the big down comforter on the bed. We stayed Sunday to Monday, and on Sunday the pool was absolutely packed, but we had no trouble finding two chaises together. As soon as we even set down our bags a pool valet came up to us and gave us towels. As we sat down another pool valet appeared and gave us a pitcher of absolutely lovely filtered or bottled ice water, I'm not sure which. This was very good, because if any of you have tried drinking Phoenix tap water, it's really bad. But then we didn't see another server the entire time we were there, and we would have ordered something from the pool bar. The other review is correct in saying that some of the crowd definitely was being overserved alcohol and got pretty loud and obnoxious. We also saw one guy who was pretty raucous spill his entire drink into the lazy river. I was not impressed that you have to pay extra to get a raft to float around the lazy river, though there seemed to always be a few floating around that you could appropriate when someone left the pool. We didn't spend time at the other pools except to walk around and see what they were like, and they were nice, if set a bit close together. I loved the splash pad for the little kids which consisted of a big area with 6 deck jets aimed at the middle, and about 1/4 inch of water on the pad. No chance of drowning there! The restaurants are very expensive, though there were several to choose from with quite a bit of variety, we chose to eat at the nearby shopping center which had many more reasonably priced options. We did have our free Blue Sage breakfast, which was nothing to write home about, and arrived almost cold. We did have the option of the breakfast buffet, but we ordered off the menu. The servers will push the blue corn pancakes and say they are to die for. We thought they were pretty gross. The spa treatments were well done, and the staff was very professional. There is a required 20% tip added on to each treatment that is payable before the service, which is nice because you don't have to bother trying to carry cash around in your robe. The amenities in the spa were wonderful, and they offer everything. The layout is a teensy bit confusing and even though I spent 2 days there I still kept getting lost. On a side note, anywhere you go and anywhere you sit you will have something beautiful to look at. The hotel takes their theme of earth-water-wind-fire very seriously and incorporates into every aspect of the grounds and decor. It is just beautiful there, and I will stay longer next time and take more advantage of what the resort has to offer. Moving on, parking is $18 or 20 a day through valet. I recommend self parking, which is a little bit of a hike, but the walk to the front door is spectacular all along the way, and with everything to see it makes the walk go quickly. The valet staff is hugely helpful and friendly, and very quick to do anything you ask. The bell staff was equally nice and eager to please, as were the front desk staff, which was evident on the day we checked out. Being Elite Members of Marriott is supposed to entitle you to perks, which really don't mean that much, but the one we looked forward to was the free access to the spa for each day of our stay. We had access included anyway the first day because of the spa treatments, but we wanted to spend the day after we checked out enjoying the spa as well. We called a couple of times before we arrived to makes sure this was the case, and they said that it was. They also invited us to arrive early before check-in and use the pool and whatever else we wanted even before we were to be able to get into our room. Wow! Anyway, we checked out and went to the spa only to be told that we could use the gym, but to get a locker and robe, and to use the pool woud be a $25 charge. No way! We went back to the front desk, explained the situation, and after a minute the girl came back and told us to go enjoy our day at the spa, it was all taken care of. We found out later that the spa had charged our $50 fee to the front desk, and the hotel comped it to us. The spa told us that that was a source of contention between the hotel and the spa, and guests were usually misinformed of spa policy. What? Either way, we camped out at the pool for most of the day, we were the only two people there, and we were waited on by the servers exclusively. It was incredibly relaxing and quiet. The pool wasn't heated though, and I was too chicken to get in all the way; it was cold! Everything was great, and I will go back with my family and enjoy the hotel fully. The only other thing I have to say that is even a little bit negative is that it seemed that a lot of the staff was non-English speaking, as in mostly Russian, and we had a very hard time getting our questions answered. It was very difficult communicating with many staffers there, and if you wanted anything done or had pertinent questions you had to go to someone fairly high up on the hotel food chain, where they all spoke English. All in all I give this hotel an A-; we loved it! To break it down pricewise, we basically paid for our spa treatments, and got the room, the breakfasts, and the extra day at the spa for free. $269 total, with the spa treatments and tips being worth that, the room would have been another $115 or so, the breakfast came out to $45 including tip, the extra day at the spa, $50. Great deal, so I highly recommend taking adantage of the Summer rates; you will never know it's 110 degrees out if you are in the pool or getting a massage!", "Date": "September 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cValue for money\u201d", "Author": "Paaltjes", "ReviewID": "UR5728275", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights after an extensive trip through South West USA.

The rooms are a reasonable size - with two queen beds, a spacious bathroom with shower and a balcony. We ate breakfast in the Blue Sage most days - buffet with my son paying around $9 and mine being $19.50 - a relaxing way to start the day - especially when suffering from jet lag and waking very early in the morning during our first few days in arizona. We spent some time by the pool most days and these were rarely crowded - but were noisier at the weekends when large groups of 'young (ish) men and women' would drink (a fair amount) and generally get quite loud as they turned pink in the arizona sunshine - golf parties or conference attendees - i don't know. There were many 'local' families on one occasion being allowed into the pool area by residents - you need a room key to access the pool area, they just asked if they would open the gates for them! It didn't seem to be a big problem really as the hotel pools are large and this is the off season. We ate pool side on several occasions and the food was fine - although one server over charged us on several occasions (the hotel put this right when I checked out). We had one meal (on our last day - and the server then told us that on purchasing one drink from the pool area (soft) we were entitled to refills all day (news to us) - I wonder if that will be the case next summer? - although we'd never been told this before. We ate room service often - my son prefers it, and it was usually pretty promptly delivered and generally warm. There is a 20% charge + $3 and tax added to each order - ouch! We were able to order using the inroom computer and confirm availability online - so my son was able to order the food for us this year - a nice touch. Check in and out of the hotel were easy and my special requests were met (computer and fridge). Most of the staff are attentive and helpful - always polite and friendly - the pool staff less so this year than last. We made use of the complimentary laundry service - with soap and softener provided - and left with clean clothes to finish our arizona holiday in the marriott canyon villas.

At no time did any Marriott person offer any apology for our inconvenience or show any sense of caring. When all systems function correctly it is easy to run the ship.

As a side comment, be sure before you stay here that you want a mega complex with all the associated large crowds, noise and a very crowded pool area with no cabanas and very few umbrellas.

We literally kept the door open with fans blowing the slightly cooler air from the hallway (which was still very warm) into the room. The hotel moved us to another room in the area....but same problem. We finally gave up our suite and moved to a standard room closer to the lobby and the air conditioning was at best, adequate (we kept our fan!).

The food was great, noone I was with, was ever dissapointed in there choices. The salads could feed a small family, and at $12-14 each they should. Heres a tip: They offer a smaller managable half-size salad for $6-8 each that is still enough to fill up even a large appetite. But they wont tell you they offer this smaller size, we just found out by accident. Food and drink service poolside was a little on the slow side but the young people that were working the pool in 100+degree heat deserved a medal for that alone.

My only complaint about this goregeous place was the selection of places to eat. There is NOWHERE to just grab a low-cost meal. Even the cafe that is poolside charged $12 for a cheesburger, $12-14 for salads, and $10-12 for average drinks.(Everyone was raving about there Pina Coladas w/toasted coconut in all fareness) The restaurants I'm sure were fabulous, I only ate in the 2 that were the most affordable. You can also have drinks and a small food menu out on the large patio in the back of the hotel. ( I recommend the \"Chicken Wonton-Tostada's\" they were unreal....Yumm!!!)

Parking: The hotel unfortunately allows its staff to use a huge part of the closest parking area. The reason is that management attempts to force you to use the valet service ($ 20 per day).

There was relaxing New Age type music playing in their botanical garden, and sometimes in their dining areas. It added to the natural setting, as did the baby bunnies, quail families, and hummingbirds that we saw on a regular basis.

We requested early check-in and arrived at the resort around 1pm. We were helped promptly (no line) and given the keys to our room. We were on the 4th floor (the infamous free laundry floor) and our room was non-smoking with a King sized bed. The view, even though the front desk clerk said was wonderful, was interrupted by nearby buildings. However, I said we were locals so mountain views aren't really too \"new\" to us anyway. The room appeared clean, except for the week-old newspaper and towel on the armoire and the broken nightstand door... otherwise everything else was fine. The bed was WONDERFUL - we slept through the night in peace. We had a spa package through the hotel - a great deal - 2 spa treatments, daily spa access, a room, and breakfast for two at the blue sage all for $289.... not bad. I have nothing but great things to say about the Revive Spa. We received a hot stone treatments and afterwards I used the sauna and steam rooms. There is also a pool in the back. Men and women are split throughout, except for the pool area and the bistro. The staff was very helpful, and there is everything a person needs to relax at this spa. There are also showers stocked with shampoo, conditioner, body wash, shave gel, razors, etc - and mouthwash at the sinks. I loved it so much I came back early this morning (yes, we came back today) to sit in the steam room. I'm thinking about going back just to spend the day there sometime in the future. Last night we ate at the shopping center across the street and had dessert at the Meritage Steakhouse. This morning we had our complimentary breakfast at the Blue Sage which was very filling (we did the buffet). We didn't have time for the lazy river, but it is basically a pool that is about three feet deep with jets to move the tubes along - great attraction for kids. The property is beautiful - even though I am from this area it really felt like a vacation. We enjoyed walking on the trails and over the bridges. The parkinig lot is far away, but if you look around the property, you might find some spaces closer to the room once you're checked in. One more thing: Even though I was there for just a night, it felt like a 3-day vacation! Definitely worth it!

There were four of us in our party and the room was just a bit small but that was because the beds are small. But we were fine with that and even had a roll away brought up which was nice. We ate dinner at the golf club steak house. Nice but the service was slow a bit and they forgot a lot. It was quite expensive too and we kept feeling like we were being watched or something. You know the feeling, like everyone thinks that you dont belong there. But we ignored that and had a good meal. We swam that night in one of the pool and that was nice and relaxing. While we did that we could hear the live music playing in the patio area which made the moolight even more special. We did use roomservice for night snacks and that was prompt and good. That is 24 hours too. The bathroom was beautiful with a seperate shower and tub. Everything in marble and well stocked. The bath goodies that they give you are wonderful and we had to get some from the spa store to take home so we could have them there too. The beds are very very comfortable and I slept well. However, fitting two people on the bed if they arent children is quite hard. For two adults a King Bed would be best. In the morning we had breakfast at the Blue Sage Restr. on the grounds and that was wonderful and well priced. I will go back there over and over again to eat when we visit.

The pools and the lazy river raft ride were clean and inviting, especially after a round of golf on one of the two world class golf courses. The Wildfire Golf Club was truly worth the trip. We enjoyed both the Arnold Palmer and Nick Faldo courses so much that we played 18 holes on one day and 36 holes the next. The Pro Shop staff was always courteous and treated golfers to a memorable golf experience.

Then the bell staff took my luggage and then up to the room, along the way he was telling us about the area and what to and not do to in Phoenix. I planned a side trip to the Grand Canyon and he even told us the best way to get there. We had a standard room which was very nice for 2 people. Beautiful bathrooms are the norm. Bed is very confortable and easy to fall asleep on. We had a nice view of the grounds on our balcony and was nice just to sit out there and enjoy the weather and ambient sounds of the resort. The hotel restaurants are all great and the food is top notch. I highly recommend the butterfish at Roy's and the Salmon dish at the italian place there (forgot the name). When you get out to the main pool area (which there are a lot of different pools) you get to experience how nice the place really is. There are waterfalls, tons of desert flowers, cacti, etc to look at. There were plenty of chairs available and the area was not overly crowded at all. We were there on the weekend and you still can find a place to sit, even in the afternoon. You can sit anywhere and the staff will come by and take your food and drink order and you can eat right by the pool. The lazy river is great to get out of the hot sun and you can relax in there for hours on end just floating aournd. They even have a waterslide for the kids. I saw all different types of people, families, etc, so everyone is welcome here and kids are not a problem. They have 2 fitness centers, one where you have to pay $10 for that includes other spa services, and a free one, which I used and is better than your average hotel gym. They had 8 new treadmills, ellipitcals, free weight area, bikes, etc. Better weight machines are in the pay gym though. Golf courses are well maintained and very challenging. I do not play golf that much, but it was one of the nicest courses I have played. There are 2 and I played the Faldo one.

There was no place to put anything in the double room and we were tripping over each other. Even the coffee maker was hidden away in the closet.

We had a very comfy king bed and a pullout which was a twin. So we had to get a rollaway and fit it in between. This left for very little room. They were out of rollaways when we called but we found a maid who brought one right to us. The bath was fine, but only one sink and one plug area. Very limiting. Otherwise it was fine. Pools: My kids loved the lazy river and the main pool with the fountain. It was cool the week we went but the water was heated. There was never a towel shortage either. They have pitchers of water and cups free of charge which is great. Kids: there were tons of kids, all ages and yes, they do play continuously in the grassy area.

The pool was large but had several strips and smaller pools for privacy for those of us that are not excited about how we look in a bathing suit. The service at the pool was good and drinks were $9 but you could double the size for $13.50. So $6-7 per drink which really isn't bad for a pricey resort. The concierge was amazing. They recommend two different off the beaten path restaurants that were wonderful and full of character. There are little firepits throughout the resort. We mentioned while stand at the concierge desk it would be fun to make smore's. The girl working the counter started a furious search (9PM) for supplies for us. She called the executive chef at home and asked where to find marshmallows... we kept telling her don't do this we can go to the store!

My wife works for Marriott, and I stay in hotels over 150 nights a year, so we both have a good basis for comparing hotels to each other. First of all, the resort is beautiful. The gardens are immaculate and go beyond just being pretty. There is just something about a stylish building (that's only 6 stories tall) surrounded by ponds, fountains, pools, lawns, flowers, golf courses, and LOTS of palm trees. You could easily mistake this for a Hawaiian island setting. Our room was above average, overall. It was pretty big, with a large bathroom and bright walls, it was very clean, and there is a hint of some kind of flower perfume that is pleasant when you walk in. I was surprised that for $500 a night, though, that guests still have to pay $10 daily if they want internet access. You can stay at Courtyard by Marriott for under $100 w/ free internet. The pools were very warm at 86 degrees, and the Lazy River was nice and relaxing. There seems to be lots and lots of space for guests at the pools - hundreds of lounge chairs. The fitness center is great - all new equipment, including cardio w/ individual televisions, free weights, and machines. All of the hotel staff was very professional and pleasant. We ate at Roy's one night and off-property for all other meals. Roy's was nothing to write home about. We had eaten at the one in Pebble Beach, which was very good, but this one was about a 7 out of 10. We ordered the appetizer sampler platter, and everything was delicious, though pricey at $25. The entrees we ate were two of Roy's signature dishes - \"macadamia nut encrusted mahi-mahi w/ lobster Cognac sauce\" and soy-glazed butterfish. Both fish were cooked well and tasted good, but lacked depth of flavor. They was no explosion of flavors in the mouth. So, the meal was good, but not outstanding in my opinion. Service was very slow every step of the way, from taking our order, to getting a drink, to getting dessert (it took over 30 minutes even though we ordered the souffle with our dinner order, as recommended on the menu). They came around early on and gave us each 1 breadroll (yum!), but despite my requests for another roll, we never saw the bread guy again the entire night. There are plenty of places to eat near the hotel, if you don't want to go fancy all the time. We spent a whole day in Old Town Scottsdale. We highly recommend a sundae at The Sugar Bowl and authentic Mexican food at Los Olivos. So, I think the Marriott is a very nice hotel, but probably a bit pricey for the average traveler, espescially considering the cost of eating on-site.", "Date": "February 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cHorrible!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4453628", "Content": "I have to say that I absolutely could not WAIT to leave this place.

So many waterfalls and fountains around, it just feels so relaxing. After getting to our first room, we decided that since we'd be staying for a week, we would like a room with a better view, and they gladly gave us one overlooking the botanical gardens and the driving range. The restaurants are delicious, and it was a treat to sit by the pool and enjoy a margarita and the cobb salad. The golf is a little pricey ($190/round), so we decided to use the driving range each day. We couldn't have had a better time. There are so many shops in close proximity to the resort, we felt like we were in heaven. The Spa is amazing, and to fully enjoy it you need to spend the entire day there. We had lunch, sat by the pool, and got a couples massage. It was all AMAZING! The only downside was that on the day we checked out, we were awakened by a fire alarm at 4am.

This is a beautiful resort with excellent grounds and rooms. Check in was smooth and the room we received was in a very good location, just steps from the exercise room and the \u201clazy river\u201d pool, and in close proximity to the main pool and the lobby areas. The room was ground floor, with a patio overlooking gardens and the golf course. A room one or two floors higher, with balcony, would have afforded a better view, but we were happy with ours. The room was very large, with king size bed, sofa, coffee table, two chairs, desk, television cabinet, and a huge marble/tile bathroom with both tub and separate shower (glass enclosed). The bathroom amenities were top-notch. The room was immaculate when we checked in and stayed that way while we were there. The room also included a digital safe and small fridge to the side of the mini-bar. The only complaint at all about the room is that the fridge did not keep things real cold, just cool. We had a small ice chest with us so things we wanted to be really cold we just iced down. The resort is quite large and spread out, so be prepared to walk. While valet parking is offered, it is not mandatory and self parking is available. It is quite a walk from the self park lot to the room wings so people that have mobility problems should be aware of that. The exercise room by the pool area is open 24 hours and is very well equipped with state of the art equipment. It was busy while we were there, but early morning visits usually found open treadmills. The spa was very nice and offers the typical services. It also has another pool available, but one must pay a daily spa fee to use it. This might be worth it when the resort is full of kids but while we were there we say maybe 4 children. There is also another exercise room located adjacent to the spa, but it is not open 24 hours. The grounds and the public areas are very nice. There are several dining options available in the resort, as well as a Starbucks for coffee drinks. There is of course lots of out door dining space. The bars at the main pool and the lazy river offer a wide selection of drinks (reasonably priced for a resort) and a nice selection of food (also not priced too badly) and make a nice place for a pool side lunch. We ate dinner at the resort only one evening, at Roy\u2019s, which was excellent. It was expensive but worth every cent. We both chose the fixed price menu which is good value at $33. It offers a very nice selection of Roy\u2019s specialties served in three courses. Roy\u2019s also has a nice wine list and offers some fairly inexpensive house wines (which were quite good) by the glass. We highly recommend Roy\u2019s. Just outside the gate of the resort is the Desert Ridge Shopping Center which offers a wide variety of dining options and many shops. Hint: if you want to buy liquor, beer or wine to stock the room, Osco Drugs is MUCH cheaper than the Albertsons Grocery store. Marriot offers a free shuttle to and from the shopping center so you could leave your car parked at the hotel. It runs until fairly late in the evening. We really enjoyed our stay and rate this hotel as excellent. We were able to relax around the pools, have some good food and drinks, and just chill, which we both badly needed.

There was live entertainment in the evenings so you could sit outside and enjoy it. Roy's restaurant is excellent. It is open for dinner only. I recommend the Blackened Ahi Tuna and the chocolate souffle. It was so good that we had dinner there two nights in a row. The pools were crowded during the day, but it was too hot for us to be by the pools during the day anyway. We used the hot tubs and pools at night which was nice since it was less crowded. The fitness center was great. I especially liked that it was open 24 hours and there weren't any hidden \"resort fees\" to use the fitness center. My favorite part was Revive Spa. The facility is absolutely gorgeous. Treatment includes full use of the facility which includes a fitness center, steam room, showers, jacuzzi, sauna, as well as a beautiful outdoor pool and spa.

Still conflicted on my feelings regarding our stay. My husband was out there for a conference and it just happened that our anniversary was the day after the conference ended. So I flew out a few days after he did and we just extended our stay. Overall I enjoyed it. The grounds are breathtaking! The food is great and everyone is very friendly. I really liked the location because it was located between Phoenix and Scottsdale and close to the freeway. It made getting around very easy. The staff was very helpful and always had smiles on their faces. Like I've already said the grounds are amazing. I really can't say enough about that and it really made up for the bad things (I'll get to those). There is a patio just outside the lobby that has several tables and lounge chairs with firepits and it was always the place to be in the evening and early morning. I really enjoyed taking a book and just hanging out. The pools are very nice and never seemed crowded. Okay so here are the few negatives. The pools weren't heated and it wasn't very comfortable to swim. However, this was in November. Second, I called two weeks in advance and spoke with someone at the hotel. I explained that my husband was going to be there for the conference but that I would be flying in halfway through the week for our anniversary. I told her it would be great if we could get a room with a good view and a king sized bed. When my husband got there he was put in a room with doubles. He told the front desk I would be there in 3 days for our anniversary and could they move him as soon as a king came available. So when I arrived 3 days later he was still in the doubles. We slept in seperate beds because I am 5 months pregnant and there was NO way we could both squeeze into one of those little beds. Not ideal on a romantic getaway. The next day we called and again requested a king room. We were called back around noon and were told our new room was ready and a bellman was on his way up to move us. We loaded everything up and made the trek across the hotel to our new room. When we opened up the door it was another double but the view was amazing (pools). The bellman called the front desk and explained we were wanting a king and again said it was for our anniversary. He was told which room to take us to but it was on the 3rd floor and overlooked the front drive! Not exactly romantic but we opted for the king vs. the view. This was the biggest problem we had. I know the hotel was sold out because of conferences. However, it just seems to me that someone would've thought to put more of the single business travelers into the doubles and leave the king rooms for couples. Also, over the course of a week can you really tell me there wasn't a king room with a decent view that came available. Also, my husband is a preferred Marriott reward holder. So much for rewarding loyalty that week. We did make the best of it and really enjoyed ourselves. Overall it was nice. Just a few little annoying things that keep me from giving it an \"Excellent\".

Our check in was easy but was somewhat dismayed at the poor view from our room given the fact that I am a Marriott Rewards member. Our balcony overlooked...a roof.

There were a couple little maintenance things that could have been overlooked in our room but it really didn't make a difference in our stay. One of the lightbulbs was out in our bathroom and part of the shower handle was coming off the wall a little. Our room was on the fifth floor and when the bellman took us through the hallways, it was very warm. But maybe, that is to be expected in Phoenix in August.

Inside one entrance out to the parking lot, there were dried flowers or leaves on the floor that were there the entire four days we stayed. I kinda thought that would have been cleaned up as soon as it was noticed by the staff. The lobby was beautiful and very clean though! All the beautiful marble and large windows overlooking the back of the hotel. There was always iced tea and water available to the guests. At night, it is absolutely beautiful on the grounds, torches lit along the pathways and fire pits with comfy chairs and table all over. We enjoyed our visit to the spa tremendously! The Revive Spa was a beautiful building. The private spa pool was a very relaxing place to enjoy the rest of the afternoon after our massages. If I were to suggest to anyone coming to the Marriott Desert Ridge, ask for a room other than in Wing A if you have a car. While walking out to the parking lot from this wing, you walk past the garbage area and there is a strong sewer and garbage odor there. Like I said earlier, if we had paid the standard rate I would have been just a little bit disappointed but we were really able to overlook these little issues and still had a wonderful time!!", "Date": "August 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cThis JW is VERY nice!

The regular gym had a little bit of \"high school locker room smell\"--which happens when people work out....but we found the Spa Gym a bit less crowded.

We had a fabulous time there - spending the majority of it in the pool areas. We loved the lazy river. My kids preferred not using a tube but just \"free floating\". My 4 year old wore a ski life vest and was able to safely float, too. The resort is very beautiful, especially at night. The many pool areas are nice so that everyone can find a pool that is their speed. One pool we called the \"quiet pool\" because it is off to the side a bit and was used very little. We were, however, disappointed with the poolside service. During 6 days there we always had to wave down a waiter to get them to come by. Very few servers would stop by and say, \"Can I get you anything?\". Once they took our first order, we would usually receive fine service. Poolside food is pretty good. Kids meals are a deal at $4 with soda, fries, and entree. My kids ended up sharing one since they were good size. The Cobb is great and huge! We were also surprised that the poolside service and bar close at between 6:00 and 7:00 pm. The rooms were spacious and nice. Our view over the front courtyard area was nice because the city lights at night were gorgeous. During the evenings we often sat out on the patio (Vista Lounge) and listened to the music, had drinks, ate off the small appetizer menu and watched our kids play for hours on the grassy area with several other children. They had a blast and it worked for us. Our overall experience was great, though I did not feel we received great service in any area. I was never told about many of the perks at resort and only knew of them because of TripAdvisor. For example, the complimentary laundry on the 4th floor, the free shuttle to the mall area, the gym, spa specials, etc. We would definitely come back to the resort with our children.

The resort itself is beautiful with many pools to fit whatever age group is interested. The lazy river was a nice feature for all ages. A large grass area in the center of the resort allowed kids to run and run. I saw kids playing there from morning until night. The rooms were nice and spacious and the balcony a nice touch. It allowed us to put our kids to sleep at a decent hour and continue to enjoy drinks on the balcony that overlooked the outdoor seating and band. We felt like we were part of the nightlife without having to leave the room. Once you closed the sliding door to your room is sufficiently cut out the noise from the outside. The outdoor Desert Ridge Mall which is adjacent to the Marriott property ( the resort faces away from this) was extremely convenient to access the 30 or so restaurants which offered a nice variety of prices and food choices. It even had a Target for those last minute items you did not bring (actually knowing its there we would have just bought some things when we got there). This location of Desert Ridge is north of Phoenix and convenient to 17 that allowed us day trips to the Grand Canyon, Sedona and Verde Canyon.

Often first impressions of a hotel are formed quickly while checking in. Once again, Marriott came through with a check-in time of about 90 seconds. The associate who checked me in was friendly and efficient. I liked the fact that he asked if I wanted help to my room, which I never do when traveling alone. I lucked out getting one of the better view rooms in the resort. Room 6303 is on the 6th (top) floor and looks directly out onto the garden, stream, and pool with the desert and the mountains in the background. I made good use of the small balcony by having my room service dinner there. The room itself was about average size, but decorated and furnished very nicely. Everything was of good quality, especially the bed, pillows, and bed linens. The king bed was one of Marriott\u2019s new \u201cI want one of these at home\u201d beds. They are extremely comfortable. The duvet covering the bed seemed freshly laundered. On one of the night stands was a CD player/clock radio, a nice touch. My only disappointment with the room was that there was no swiveling-tilting office-type chair. I guess it would have not fit with the d\u00e9cor, but I always have work to do and a good office chair is appreciated. The desk also fit with the d\u00e9cor, but was not as conducive to working as a true desk would be. I suspect very few visiting this resort spend much time at a desk in the room! The bathroom was great. It was large and had both tub on one side of the room and a glassed in shower on the opposite side. The lighting was excellent. There were the usual upscale assortment of amenity items, a hair dryer and a magnifying mirror. There were plenty of thick towels. It was 109 degrees when I checked in and I took advantage of the pool quickly. Actually the pool complex has three pools, each different and on a different level. There were stacks of pool towels available and I saw most guests had pitchers of ice water at their lounges. I decided to try the Lazy River pool where you can effortlessly float in an inner tube around the pool in about 10 minutes. That was great! It being summer vacation there were a lot of kids, but that was to be expected. I had room service for dinner and was impressed when the associate who took my order suggested instead of the soup of the day they prepare me shrimp chowder. She said the regular soup did not look very good. The shrimp chowder and my American Kobe Beef burger were great. It took about 25 minutes from the time I called until my dinner arrived. I also liked the fact that they said up front that a 20% gratuity was being added as well as a delivery charge. Some hotels have a service charge and I am never sure how much of that the server gets. All of the hotel associates that I came in contact with were very friendly and helpful. My room key stopped working (I took it into the pool) and instead of just giving me another key, the front desk associate came with me to my room to make sure I did not have any other problems. I had a drink at the lobby bar and the service there was prompt and very friendly. There is a lot to do at this resort. Besides the pools, there is a wonderfully equipped health club. It is next to the spa and is complimentary. You don\u2019t have to pay to use the spa to use the workout room. There was every conceivable piece of exercise equipment you could want. Most had LCD monitors and wireless earphones. Another thing I liked about the hotel was the Starbucks. Their patio overlooked the botanical gardens.

Around Memorial weekend we had the Pediatric Nurses Convention. Food: Roy's was excellent.. Drew our waiter was fabulous as was the Manager that night.. she knew we were celbrating a 50th Birthday and gave us a quiet area in the patio overlooking the grounds.

We did utilize the Cloud Room facilities and the staff catered to all our wishes.. by the way, the chocolate chip cookies were fabulous.

Based on what I had read on TripAdvisor.com and based on information from a person in my office who had briefly visited the resort, I had some hesitation about staying here. I knew that it was in the middle of nowhere, and I also knew that it catered to large groups. Plus, I had the pleasure of staying twice at the JW Marriott Camelback Inn, both times for a business conference. I really enjoyed the Camelback and knew the experience at Desert Ridge would be quite different. However I got offered a package deal at Desert Ridge for a price that I couldn\u2019t turn down and just wanted to relax in the desert for a few days My first reaction was mixed. I checked in on a Saturday, and the place was busy, no doubt about it. It was hot and I was looking forward to a long swim, but the pools were crowded with kids. Plus, the one pool that seemed somewhat suitable for lap swimmers was closed for a special event. I asked the front desk if I could be comped to use the Spa pool, and they said fine. That was a nice bonus (and service proved to be excellent at the resort, during the course of my entire stay), since use of the spa facilities cost $25 at a minimum. The pool was beautiful, but I still felt it in no way compared to the spa pool at the Camelback. Despite my initial mixed reaction, the place grew on me day by day. The Desert Ridge is the largest hotel in Arizona, but to me, it didn\u2019t feel that way. The architect did a great job of making the resort seem like a manageable size. There is still quite a bit of walking to do, but not nearly as much as some of the big Vegas hotels. The hotel was pretty full over the weekend (and less so as the week went on), but for the most part, the restaurants, pool, and area by the pool never seemed congested. There were a couple of big groups there, but they never bothered me. Rooms were quite large size and were very cheerful. The bathroom were large too, with a separate marble tub and shower. There were some quirks with the rooms: there seemed to be a waste paper basket only in the bathroom and not by the desk as well ; the shower leaked, unless you positioned the showerhead in a certain way, and there was no way to turn the light on the balcony off, meaning you had to completely close the curtains to get to sleep. But these complaints are relatively minor and in no way subtract from the great overall experience at the hotel. I only ate at the Blue Sage, the casual restaurant. Great burgers at lunch and dinner; breakfasts was good, but not great. Prices were on the high side, but I\u2019ve seen them higher elsewhere. However, unlike a lot of other resorts, you are not locked into eating only at the overpriced restaurants on the property. A short way from the hotel is an outdoor mall with a good food court, an Albertsons supermarket, Einstein Bagels and a bunch of casual restaurants including On the Border Caf\u00e9 and California Pizza Kitchen. This really gives a guest a lot more options, in term of food. For those without a car, I think the hotel runs shuttles to this mall, and if it\u2019s not scorching hot, it\u2019s probably not a bad walk. The best feature of this hotel for me was the beautiful two-level lobby and outdoor patio area, as well as the beautiful pool area. The resort was extremely conducive to relaxation. While it is true, that Desert Ridge is somewhat isolated and away from the heart of the action in Phoenix, I found it fairly easy and quick to get around by car, and since I\u2019ve been to Phoenix many times, I preferred staying close by the hotel.

The property outside impeccably managed ... full of flowers, waterfalls, palm trees etc. Always the sound of relaxing soft music everywhere, as they have speakers throughtout all the garden areas.

Perfect (not too much or too little) and always with a smile. I've been to scores of resorts and hotels as I travel a lot and never felt so welcomed. Everything was right on time and to our specification. Tips seemed appreciated in return for good work, not expected. Maids, front desk, bell, wait staff, and valet all took the time to say good morning and play with our 1 year old. Recreation ... Pools are the highlight as discussed earlier. The Wildfire Golf Club has two courses, Faldo and Palmer. I thought the Faldo was OK. I'm not a fan of the overbunkered type of course. I've played better desert layouts. Everything was well maintained and in great condition though and service was outstanding. A little pricy at $150, but that does include range, cart and 6 Calloway balls. Food ... There are 4 real restaurants ... the others are really casual, patio type snack bars. Roy's was outstanding (I mean top level outstanding). Blue Sage was average / good. We didn't eat in Tuscany or Meritage but I heard both were very good. The pool bar serves great lunches ... we ate lunch there every day. The have outstanding salads (Cobb is awesome) and great wraps. We went offsite a few nights. Spa ... My wife said it was incredible. I was wondering if she would ever come back. The resort does a great job with young children. Although it does cater to business meetings, we hardly even saw them even though there was a huge one in the hotel. It is very large and plenty of space for all. Pool and restaurants not really crowded, even though hotel had high capacity. All in all ... If you want a desert vacation ... you can't go wrong here.

Rooms are average and the bathroom after reading the reviews was very disappointing. Only one sink and not very large at that. Eventhough there is a sperate shower stall, it was so on top of the toilet that when you opened the shower door you just miss the toilet by about 2 inches. One day I had the call front desk to get my room cleaned. This was after 2:00 pm the day after I checked in. I was told they were busy because a lot of guest checked out and new ones were arriving and they needed to turn over the rooms. So I quess that means I was put on the back burner since I was already checked in. Staff were ok, but not 5 star helpful or even 5 star friendly. Beware major conventioneers at this hotel. In fact the week I was there the hotel was 95% booked and probably 80% of quest were there on conventions. They litterly take over the hotel. One night the only lobby lounge in the hotel was taken over by these conventioneers and there was no place to sit and have a quite drink. Also a hugh TV screen was brought in so all the \"men\" could watch Monday night football, for which they proceeded to behave as typical male's would during a football game. I think you know what I mean. Another evening most of the pool area and hot tub section was closed off for a private convention dinner party. This type of service would not happen in a true 5 star resort. The Marriott is trying to match the Ritz Carltons and Four Seasons, but are falling short. Remimber conventioneers do not pay out of their pockets for these trips, their corporations do. They could care less about your hard earned vacation. All in all not worty of a 5 star rating.

For the days we were there, we awoke early (since we were still on EST) and took full advantage of the desert botanical tour, the Starbucks and other morning activities offered by the hotel. Days were spent poolside, and we enjoyed the food of the pool bar, as well as the Jamaican steel drums that lulled in the background. Evenings we would decide upon a restaurant and events over a glass of wine while listening to the live music around the fire pit. Everything was new, clean and gorgeous. The concierge desk was very helpful in lending restaurant recommendations, and providing directions to everywhere you could imagine.

My husband and I stayed for four nights and paid to upgrade ourselves to a Cloud Room. Well in advance (ie 3 weeks), reservations were made for all four restuarants with specific requests for outdoor seating. On arrival we were greeted well by many people and thought we were onto a winner here although it did take us some time to attract the attention of the gentleman at the Cloud Room to gain admission. Our first nights meal at Roys was exceptional with excellent attentive service; our room was beautiful and our walk in the gardens delightful. Day Two went well until Dinner, when we were seated in a corridor at Blue Sage (the dining room was empty) advised no outside seating was available (though tables were visible) and served our entree four minutes after our appetizer - the server could not understand we were not ready for it so left it anyway. Next day our problems started with the Cloud Room - this has the potential to be a great facility and the staff really do try their best. However, for Appetizers read - lovely food but used as Childrens Teas and dinner by those too mean to pay for it elsehwere. On one day there were 12 children racing around the room and others shouting and crying - one parent even pushed in ahead of us to get the last of an appetizer as it all was l her little darling would eat - we had to go without. The staff advised they have no control over the number of children in the roomas any guest in a cloud room can bring in unlimited children to the room free - so it is not a quiet oasis of calm for a pre dinner drink - quite the opposite. Breakfast was even worse as one dear child was in training for the Muffin Throwing at the Olympics event much to the amusement (and encouragement) of their parents. Obviously the hotel is not responsible for the behaviour of the parents, but be warned on the marketing, this is not the quiet facility you might think you are paying for. Contrast that with our lovely well cooked, romantic meal outdoors at the Tuscany where incidentally delightful well mannered child sat at the next table to us. Wildfire was also a good spot, though again that evening our pre dinner drinks were a shambles as the kids had empty all the adult mixers and Perrier from the fridge and the staff had to get more brought up - and when the first lot arrived doting grandparents took all the water bottles for the children. The poor assistant was so frustrated as he tried to get our preferred drinks to us. Other lapses that needed addressing were, a 50 minute wait for the (wrong) food order at the pool, with no supervisor available to register a complaint - an offer of free drinks was made but as we were about to drive and did not want alcohol or desserts that was worthless. Also had to point out every single day we were in a Cloud Room so should not be charged for parking, yet the charge still appeared on the final account; newspapers were not delivered on two of the days and each day we had to call housekeeping about things missing from our room (like the trashbin). Yes, some of these are minor grumbles, and many of the staff did work hard to provide a very good personal service, but the hotel let itself down too many times during our stay for us to rate it any higher. On check out, the lady adjusted the parking costs but was not interested in our issues re the Cloud Room (which its staff had suggested we raise with them as it concerned them too) - as we were on a tight timescale to get our flight it was pointless pursuing them, but my advice think very very carefully about spending $100 a night for a Cloud Room if you are a couple wanting a more relaxed atmosphere to sit have pre dinner drinks or breakfast in.

Little kids ran around unsupervised through the lobby and hallways. Underage (and unsupervised) kids were also jumping into the spas. Of course families taking over resorts is now commonplace and when you have a huge property like Desert Ridge it's understandable to keep the rooms full. What's funny, though, is that there are any number of other resorts in the Phoenix area with better family-oriented activities, pools, slides, games and so on. In fact, there are better places period. The Desert Ridge is far out of town cut into freshly-bladed desert and not especially convenient to anything. The place is huge and unattractive from the outside-- we thought it was a prison or a government building at first. There are other resorts that have better views and are more intimate and charming. Our standard room was smallish and appointed with only fairly humdrum furnishings. No doubt there are nicer rooms, but I like to judge a place by its standard room. The restaurants were fine and not too expensive for this kind of place -- we ate at the Blue Sage and Roys (Roys was more interesting) -- but nothing gourmet.

We were thrilled with our vacation! We were not there on business, so we just used their pools and lazy river to catch some fun in the sun! We experienced no crowds at all in the water, in fact we marveled that about 95% of the chairs were empty all day around their pools. Now, we did drop a bit of money at their Blue Sage restaurant and Roy's, but we knew we would. We could have gone across the street and saved some money, but we so adored the wonderful live music, the refreshing breezes, the lit torches and the surroundings that we couldn't tear ourselves away. Our daughter was tired of the same old kids menu items, so we requested that a small bean/cheese burrito and side of rice be made at Blue Sage--- no problem at all, they were happy to oblige. They may want to look into offering that to other kids as a healthier alternative to chicken tenders etc... I must comment on the service. I've read that some people have experienced sub par service. We did not find this to be the case at all!!! I would say that I had the best service that I have encountered at any hotel from the front desk, to the bellmen, to the valet and every restaurant too! Everyone accomodated our every request including a couple special ones with a smile--- I find it hard to believe that the service could vary so widely from the attentive and friendly help we received. We have traveled widely and found this hotel to be top notch. I think you will enjoy your stay!

This service saved us a bucnch with all the kids clothing. The location is great to get on the 101 and head anywhere in the Phoenix area quickly, yet away from all the hustle of the city. Only negative comment is the long walk to the car in the parking lot during heat of day. Probably a quarter of a mile, seems more at 100 degrees.

We both *loved* the resort, from the beautiful grounds to the excellent dinners at Blue Sage and Roy's. We spent our first day at the Revive Spa. The massages were great, and since you have access to all spa facilities for the day, schedule your massage as early as possible. We were able to enjoy the private pool area for many hours (until 8pm) away from the kids and crowds at the other pools (which weren't very crowded, but there were only a few others at the spa pool). The lobby is beautiful at night. We enjoyed sitting outside on the lounge chairs and outdoor couches, looking up at the pools with the firepits around us, sipping on drinks from the bar. Phoenix weather is also something to behold - we didn't see a cloud for 5 days and the nights were warm, but not hot. Perfect for late night strolls around the grounds. Our room was also great, with a private balcony and turn down service twice a day. The bathrooms are beautiful. Service was top notch. The staff was very nice. There is a car service to the mall across the street for $5, or it's a quick 15 minute walk (time of day is the key of making the choice to walk or get a ride.) I used the fitness facilities twice, which are adequate. If your body is on east coast time, you'll be treated to early morning sunrises across the back of the resort earlier than 5am. The gardens around the resort and water features are gorgeous. The only possible negative of the resort is that from the distance, it doesn't look like much. You can only really see the palm trees in the front and since it expands out to the north, you only see the southern stucco wings from the road. From the highway, it's even hard to pick out the resort, so the resort doesn't look like the oasis it is from a distance. However, once you drive up to resort and walk in the lobby and see the grounds, you immediately know it's a special place.

We have been to a number of wonderful hotels around the country, and none of us can wait to return to this hotel. We stayed in one of the Cloud Club rooms, which gave us access to additional amenities. If it is within your budget, the additional cost is well worth the level of service and amenities (such as full breakfast, snacks and beverages throughout the day, evening appetizers and full open bar, and dessert, including specialized concierge services) provided, and the Cloud Club staff could not be more helpful. The recreational offerings include several pools and a \"river\" pool, with a slide, that was great fun for us and for our teenage daughter and her friend. Golf courses and services were first-rate. The spa, which includes a terrific (and quiet!) pool as well as a spa restaurant, offered excellent massages. We were less impressed with the manicure/pedicure services offered in the salon, which were overpriced and lesser quality. Rooms were spacious, with balconies, and the hotel staff was attentive; on the occasions that we made a special request, we received immediate service. We at at Roy's and the Blue Sage (breakfast and dinner) and found both to be extremely high quality, with exceptional service. The appetizers that we sampled from the other hotel restaruants were excellent, as well. I would highly recommend using the hotel's vacation planning services (check the hotel web site) in advance of your visit; we did, and we received wonderful recreational, dining and cultural recommendations and had all reservations made for us prior to our arrival.

The whole thing was rushed and the lady didn't seemed like she was very experienced. My Friend got a mani/pedicure and had the same rushed experience.
