You can walk to the Sofia, Prado, and Thyssen in 15 minutes; to the Palace in 20 minutes; to Plaza Mayor in 5 minutes; to Puerto del Sol in 10 minutes. The Sunday Market (El Rastro) is two blocks from the hotel. A Metro/Tube stop is 1 block from the hotel (just down the street on the corner). There is a movie theatre and several restaurants just across the street. The hotel shares a corner building with the Hagen-Das Theatre. Just across the street are several shops, cafes, an outdoor market, souvenier shops, and the pathway to Plaza Santa Ana (many outdoor cafes/restaurants there). The rooms have interior and exterior locations. The rooms over the street can be a bit noisy in the evenings on Fridays and weekends, as people pouring out of the clubs/restaurants are headed out...and then later headed home. I was on the 4th floor and I could hear the street noise, but it didn't really bother me. I still slept with the window open. i would avoid any interior rooms that have walls that back-up to the Hagen-Das Theater on the other side. When the theatre puts on a production (usually music) you can hear every note through the walls and even feel the walls shaking. The room was nice and kept clean. It has a closet, mini-fridge, tv, 2 single beds, nightstand. The room has air conditioning and a small foyer. The bathroom is separate. Toiletries are provided (not the norm in many Spanish hotels). The shower head can be a bit awkward in some rooms...as it isn't in the usual spot at the \"end\" of the tub. In some rooms it is located in the middle of the wall. Imagine standing in the center of your tub and facing the wall. Strange, but you'll get used to it. If you get the breakfast package, you'll get a full breakfast with your room. The breakfasts are wonderful: eggs, bacon/ham, fruit, juice, coffee/tea, several pastries to choose from, potatos, and many other items to choose from. It's a good and full breakfast to start your day. There is a solarium on the roof if you feel the need to get some sun or need a quiet place to relax and read a book. The breakfast room has a large sitting area (separate room attached). There are some couches and chairs and a large screen tv. There are three computer terminals in the room with internet access. The hotel provides free wifi in the rooms and public areas. You can tell in the evenings when everyone is back in the hotel, the wifi slows down a bit. Overall, it is fast enough to let you get your work done. If you are there for business, you will not have a photcopier and you'll have to ask the front desk if they can print documents for you. No fitness center and no pool. The cleaning and front desk staff were INCREDIBLY friendly and helpful.

The metro station Tirso de Molina is just a 100 m or so. Upon arrival we were pleasantly surprised by a free upgrade to the junior sweet. The room was nice, it had a large bathroom with a massage bath (but unfortunately the massage function was not working), a nicely decorated bedroom and a separate seating area. The windows toward the light well didn't offer a view, but it was nice and quiet in a city that never sleeps. The hotel looked as if it had been quite recently refurbished. The only negative aspect (which is common in most places in Madrid) was that although we requested a non-smoking room in our booking, the carpets, sofa etc in the seating area smelled of cigaret smoke. So if you're really sensitive toward this kind of issues I suggest you contact the staff and draw their attention to your preferences.

We were weary from our long 18 hour flight. The hotel clerk was kind, understanding and very fast and efficient as she could see our state of affairs. We were assigned a room in short order. She was bilingual - Spanish and English - so when my Spanish vocabulary was lacking, she readily understood me. The room had marble flooring and a large bathroomm with tub which was very clean and equipt with towliing and an array of soaps. We had a room at the very end of the second floor hallway which made it very quiet. The window was open when we arrived and there was a nice breeze in the very temperature comfortable room. My companion and I took no time to get to sleep in their comfy beds. We awoke a few hours later, refreshed. There was good pressure and plenty of hot water in the nice bathroom for our showers. There is a bank of free computers for wifi downstairs from our room near the dining facility. I had purchased a yogurt from a store and asked for a spoon which was graciously given even though it was not time to dine yet. (It was about 3pm). Before embarking on our explore Madrid walk, we got a map and good information from the desk clerk. She asked if there was anything we needed in our room. This hotel entrance is not on a busy street, more like an alleyway. It was only 1 block to a bustle of activity of all the shops. There were many streets with really interesting shops with a variety of wares and a real abundance of restuarants of all ethnicities. We chose an east Indian restaurant which was very different but quite good. We walked to a square with a fountain that the locals seemed to be hanging out in. We continued past the fountain to a long promanade of streets which had trianguar shades at the roofs of the buildings which added shade and color. It was really interesting way to shade the walk. After walking until about 11pm, we found our way back to the hotel and got a very restful sleep. In the morning, checkout was very efficient and we were called a cab and went to the train station so we could continue our trip to Burgos. From there we started walking the Camino de Santiago, a glorious journey. I truly recommend the otel Medium Cortezo. It is all that one needs at an affordable price and near all the bustle of activity of Madrid.

I'm glad I did as, although the hotel is far from perfect, it is everything I would expect at the rates for a well located hotel in a major city. What do I mean by far from perfect? Nothing drastic, but important points nonetheless. The room was reasonably, but not excatly huge. Again, that's all I'd expect at the price. Also, there are no safes in the rooms, so valuable have to be left in safety deposit boxes beside reception. Fine for keeping money, passports etc, but no good for leaving cameras and other bulky items when going out at night. It's also a pain having to go to reception every time you want money our of the box. So, nothing drastic as I said before. The positives? For me there were plenty. Firstly, the hotel is less than 5 minutes walk from Plaza Mayor and is within easy walking distance of the Cathedral and the Royal Palace and is only about 15-20 minutes walk from the major museums and Parque Retiro. Also about 15 minutes walk away is Atoch Railway station, should you wish to venture further afield. We booked to go on a Tapas and Wine tour which meets at Plaza de la Villa and that was only two minutes further on from Plaza Mayor. Also in that close vicinity are Mercado de San Miguel and the worlds oldest restaurant, (according to the Guinness Book of Records), Sobrino de Botin. Other than location, the main pluses were the staff, (friendly and helpful, without gushing over you), and, as I said before, the price. I paid 400 Euros for five nights there and have paid more for lower quality hotels in far less central locations. So, all-in-all, I'd say it would be a good choice for anyone who doesn't expect five-star quality for three-star prices. Those are the people who would give it one star, but I gave it four. Lastly, on the subject of poor reviews, ignore what you read about Botin. I decided to take a gamble on it in spite of many lees than favourable reviews, and only did that because of the chance to eat somewhere so famous within five minutes walk from my hotel.

It was in an excellent location, just a 3 or 4 minute walk from Puerte del Sol and Plaza Mayor. A Metro subway stop is located just a block south of the hotel and there is a major Metro stop at Puerte del Sol. Restaurants, small groceries, and shops of various kinds abound in the immediate area. The air conditioning worked well in our rooms and the free wifi was a plus. The breakfast buffet was very good and fresh, including boiled and scrambled eggs, bacon, various fruits, meats and cheeses, bread and pastries, cereal, and coffee and juice. There is no restaurant for the other meals, but it is unnecessary since you'll want to try out the restaurants in the area anyway. The rooftop solarium includes a beautiful view of the surrounding area and some lawnchairs and a couple of showers if you'd like to work on your tan while you are there. An exercize room would have been nice. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. They spoke adequate English, though some spoke it a little better than others. Patricia Willems of the office staff made every effort to help us have just what we needed when we arrived. She adjusted our rooms for us just before our arrival and made the extra effort to warn us of the Metro strike that would have made our use of the metro to get to the hotel on our evening of arrival impossible. She made minibus transfer arrangements for us (about 20 minutes from the airport by bus) and made sure that everything was perfect. She even initiated contact after the trip to make sure all went well.

The hotel is very central, literally 5 minutes into the main square. We didnt have to use the metro at all to get around the city in those few days so cost saving. However, for the good sides there are always bad - and that is the noise. Our room was situated right next to the night club. From 9.30pm We Will Rock You was on which we heard with great clarity until 12.30am. Then from about 1am until 6am (I checked the time after no sleep) the night club could be heard, This was not as clear but just the base vibrating. We did get used to it. The other solution would be to check where your room was - it is probably better further away from that end of the hotel. Nearly forgot to mention one morning after little sleep (musicals & night clubs) we then heard more noise at about 8.30am. Thinking this was probably party goers on their way home I looked out to see who had been keeping us awake. However, the samaritan church located opposite our room was giving out breakfasts to homeless people. This only happened one morning thankfully as it seems the rest of the Easter weekend they went hungry!

The rooms are very basic and the beds small and uncomfortable. There was 4 us and only 3 beds and when I complained they bought another bed in!! There was very little natural light as there is one small window with no outlook. The room had a subtle scent of sewage!! I think there was a problem with the plumbing. The room is next to a theatre and you we could hear the musical full blast!! Myself and the 10 year old were wide awake until after midnight. Although my partner and the 8 year old managed to sleep through it all!! We managed to get a good deal on the booking through Airmiles which meant I could accept the negatives.
