I chose it primarily for the price and location to the Rome Termini. Hotel has definitely been updated. Our room (including bathroom) was updated. The breakfast area is nicer too - nice selection breakfast buffet served juices, eggs, pastries, bacon, prosciutto, coffee. Be aware which package you get, some include breakfast some don't, if not it's only about 8 euros per person - still well worth it. The people seemed pleasant, answering any questions necessary. Don't expect a big size room but I wasn't expecting to spend a lot of time in my room anyway. Wifi for a fee, but a lot of nearby cafes have Wifi for you. Though, not a lot of restaurants open late nearby. We tried to get something to eat around 10pm and things were closing up. McDonalds is just a few minutes away but does attract \"all\" sorts of folks due to location to Termini. But there's a lot of police around too - so never felt in danger or anything. Again, the best benefit was the location to the Rome Termini, less than a 5 minute walk. You can get to the Express to/fro the airport, Metro, which will take you to all major sites in Rome, plus the regional trains to Firenze, Venice, etc. Though other areas in Rome have more places open late, traveling with my young daughter, I didn't want to cab or pull luggage all over the place which made this place ideal.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel.......\u201d", "Author": "Jay S", "ReviewID": "UR127951823", "Content": "Traveling with 2 young kids, I must say, room was spacious, for the 4 of us.

Recently remodeled rooms: the room was spacious and very well appointed and even had Sky satellite TV. 4. The staff are generally very nice. 5. Our room was in the \"Annex\" which is a block and half down the street from the main hotel/reception. We thought this was a little weird since it seems that the other floors are actually apartments but our room was really nice so our fears were allayed. Con: And it's a big one. 1. The room smelled of the sewer. Not right when we first got in but after a couple hours. Rome was the last city on our trip and we got in late so we didnt feel like asking to change. We notified the staff and they sent a cleaning lady in the morning. She tried her best but honestly there wasnt a lot she could do. The smell was coming from the drains and toilet so we just made sure to close everything and keep the door closed. I'm sure they would have accommodated us if we wanted to switch but we were too tired to ask. Though, they did not offer it right away when we told them of the smell. 2. This isnt the most quiet part of town. There are a lot of hotels nearby and of course the train station is busy.

I had a single room, with a double bed, and while well funshied and appointed and very clean it was tiny...even by Italian standards! There was not enough space to walk around the bed on both sides and virtually no space to put your suitcase on the floor. Definately a one person room and even then rather claustrophobic!

We were planning to spend 1 night in Rome prior to taking a train to Civitavecchia for our Eastern Mediterranean cruise. We ended up paying $1 plus about $24 USD in taxes; so, we got a pretty good deal (although when you consider the fact that the voucher was for $140 USD), it was pretty pricey. We had read enough about Rome to know that things would not be cheap. We also read that a 4 star in North America is probably a 3 star in Rome, which seemed about right (we had a very nice room but a few steps form the bed area to the bathroom and entry area). Also, you should know that the check in process is very different. You will have to provide your passports and you will be charged a small fee that appears to be charged by the city of Rome (sorry I cannot remember exactly how much). The other thing os that you should try to use the transit system which is amazing. It cost us 1 Euro to get from the Vatican to the hotel; and, about $20 Euro by taxi. Just be warned that the hotel has a set of 3-5 stairs before you will get from the lobby to the lift (elevator). You will have to carry all of you luggage up these steps and back down at the end of your stay; and, the lifts are very small; so, 2 adults and luggage max. Termini station is down the street. There are many restaurants around as well. Just give yourself enough time to get around.

We booked the accommodation before reading the reviews on Trip Advisor, so were a little scared about staying here as some of the comments describe the hotel as being rough. I have no idea why people are writing bad reviews. We stayed in the economy room, and yes the room is small, but no smaller than a normal Travel Inn or Premier Inn (I know it's a four star hotel, but it is four star old fashioned not modern). The room was clean and towels changed daily. The staff were really helpful and nice, especially the staff at breakfast (say hi to the bald bloke). The only thing I would say is, unless you are booking your accommodation directly through the hotel, you are not entitled to the free airport transfers promised on the site. Also, breakfast is not the best, but does the job. They are also obviously trying to cater for American visitors by providing a Happy Hour American style buffet each evening. My advise to the hotel is, forget the American's they have no taste. They are in Rome and should stay at home if they want to stuff their faces with mounds of American food. Make it an Italian buffet and keep it sophisticated and simple. As everyone else is saying, we were really close to the Metro, which is really handy and really cheap. Don't be afraid to get lost, it is sooooo easy to find your way back to the Termini, and as big as Rome is, it is walkable. Best tip I can give is, going at this time of year (November) and visiting the Vatican, DO NOT LISTEN TO STREET VENDORS TRYING TO SELL YOU FAST TRACK TICKETS!!!! They were telling us that the queues to the Vatican and the Museums were two-hours long. We queued for St Peter's for ten-minutes and walked straight into the Museums!! We didn't even have to queue for the Sistine Chapel. PLUS, it only cost us 20 Euro's each for entrance to St Peter's and the Museums not the 32 as stated in travel guides or 45 as given by the robbing vendors. Also, everything is expensive, but you can find cheap booze and cheap food, but the places selling cheap booze don't sell the best food. For places with nice food, alcohol is REALLY expensive, Don't let this put you off, the place is so laid back, you can mix and match. And finally, make sure you go see the Trevi Fountain.

The hotel is in an excellent central location just 1 street away from the Termini Station, cross the road and the Morgana is the next road down running parallel to the station. Really good transport links to airports via train and bus, we caught the bus from Fumincino airport return, pre-booked in the UK, with Terravision which run directly to and from the airport/station for 4 euros pp each way, normally 6 but on offer. Terravison also run a shuttle bus service from the Termini to Campino Airport direct. Leonardo Express service by train which is quicker but more expensive approx 17 euros. Taxi transfer approx 40 euros 1 way. The sightseeing hop on hop off bus is 2 minuites away. We were surprised how good the location of the hotel is. We had a lovely room to the front of the hotel, the walls of the hotel are beautifully decorated with fabric, cleaned to a high standard every day with clean towels and sheets. The rooms have flat screen tv's and a fridge. The breakfast is a must, lots of choices and an excellent start to the day. They also offer an 'all you can eat' evening buffet for 8 euros with a drink, we were tempted but was a cold buffet served in the lounge/bar area. We would certainly have eaten at the hotel if the buffet were warm and a little more extensive. We thought that many of the guests would have eaten in the hotel if they had opened the restaurant as the food was very good, and sightseeing is exhausing. We were disappointed at the food offered by the local restaurants which were serving mainly pasta with sauce, meat sauce which did not seem to contain any meat and pizza bases with little or no toppings, not cheap even if you go for one of the deals as the drinks are very expensive. There are a few Indian Restaurants/kebab restaurants near the station which are cafeteria style, also self service cafe's and McDonalds. We would not recommend the area round the station late at night though. The fridge was excellent, we bought our own wine from the supermarket nearby, there are quite a few close to the hotel where you can buy your own drinks, beer from around 70c per 660cl bottle and wines very reasonably priced. No tea or coffee making facilties in the room, but having been to Rome before we brought our own. Worth bringing your kettle as a day out in Rome is very tiring! Wireless internet is available at the hotel but is 10 euros per day this we found expensive as often find this to be complimentary in 4 star hotels, if not in your room generally available in communal areas. When you leave you will also have to pay without exception a city tax of 3 euros per person per night in cash. We thought that our stay at the Morgana hotel was great, we walked from the hotel to the Colisseum, the Vatican, Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, Pantheon, Piazza Navona, all the major sights, recommend at least a 3/4 night stay to see the city properly. We dont usually post pictures of hotels we have visited on tripadvisor but as we had such a nice time here have decided to this time.

Booked with BA holidays and was pleased with the price. This is a nice hotel. I didn't think the reception staff when we arrived were overly welcoming, but others were during our stay. Its positioned 5 minutes from the train station and bus station which is ever so handy. The street is busy but you can't hear much at all with the windows shut, unfortunatley the air-con was off for the time of year and our room did get extremely warm and stuffy. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the room very modern and extremely clean. The barman was lovely and the manager of the breakfast room was charming and couldn't do enough for you. We had breakfast included and really enjoyed it. There were cereals, yoghurt, cold meats and cheeses and cake. The scrambled eggs and bacon were delicious as were the breads. The coffee was horrible, but you could ask for a cappucino etc and hot chocolate. It takes about 15 minutes to do a leisurley walk down towards the forum and colosseum. Its a nice walk and you can check out the resteraunts on the way. We would definately stay in this hotel again if retuning to Rome, it has all you need for sightseeing. Did the walking tour of the Colosseum and forum, good but manic. It was great to have your own ear pieces to hear the guide. One thing we didn't really see advertised was the 'newest building' around the forum, the Ministry of culture which was built in the 1800's. Its a beautiful building (and free admission). You get great views of Rome from it, and if you pay around 7 euros can go in the elevator the the top, we think it was worth it! There are lovely sculptures etc in the building and a bit about Italys famous revolutionaries and Poloticians which was interesting although it does lack information in English or any other language other than Italian actually which was a shame - but then again, coming from Britain I dont think anyone can do museums like we do! Got a 24hr bus hop on n off bus ticket which was handy for getting from place to place especially the Vatican. The Vatican was amazing but we didn't go in as I live with two Atheists! A trip up the nearby Castle was interesting but overpriced for whats there - which is really the shell of a fortress and good views of Rome. A day at Pompeill is a must - but it is a long day so prepare yourself, but you do get to see some of the rest of italy and mt Vesuvius is amazing in the background of the ruins, it really brings it to life! I must say, yes Rome is expensive, although there are plenty of cheap souvenirs to be found. I'm not at all impressed with the food though. We even went to eateries where the Italiens ate. 9 euros for an 'incredibly' thin pizza with not a lot on it and not a lot of taste is a bit of a rip off. I think I make better pasta than some of the meals I saw and tried, we even heard Italiens complain. Beer from a trolley car averages 3.50euros and a bottle of coke 2 euros. Your lucky to get a bottle of beer in a resteraunt for 5 euros, usually 6! Rome is a lovely city break but you won't see and enjoy it unless you stay for a minimum of 4 nights I'd say.

The hotel is one block away from the main railway terminal in Rome centre. This is very convienient to get to most of the attractions, but like the Kings Cross area in London or Gare Du Nord in Paris, the streets around the Morgana are seedy, and full of cheapish hotels, tourist oriented restaurants and street traders selling counterfiet handbags and other trashy stuff. It didn't particularly feel unsafe, just ... seedy. The hotel reception is small and crowded most of the time, the bar comfortable (although drinks are expensive) and breakfast room adequate. The staff were polite but not interested, for example they couldn't seem to programme my keycard for more than 24 hours at a time, so having gone to the 5th floor only to have to come back down again each day to have the card reprogrammed was treated with polite and slightly amused indifference. The hotel has 100 rooms across 5 floors and is a labyrinth. There are 2 lifts, both minute and very slow. If you dont like lifts, steer clear of any room above the first floor. I had booked 2 rooms, one double occupancy for my daughters and a single occupancy for me. The single room I was in (524) is really tiny, just enough room for a single bed. The en suite is similarly tiny, you have to navigate around the sink to get to the WC and around the WC with your back to the wall to get to the shower. The room was clean and reasonably well decorated and had flat screen TV but the signal quality was awful. The soundproofing was not great so light sleepers will have a problem with neighbours. We visited in mid-October, when the weather in Rome is still very warm (t-shirt's were fine) but the Morgana has already switched off their air conditioning and the rooms were like ovens. My daughters had to move after the first night because of the heat. I had to have the window wide open all night, which overlooked the a small central courtyard. 6.30 seemed to be the time to start bottling up downstairs so sleep was impossible from then on. The manager said that they switch off the cooling because of the \"changing season\", it felt more like a money saving measure to me. I think Morgana is typical of hotels in this price bracket and this district of Rome. As a base to tour the city, it is convienient, and of course, if you arrive by train, ideal. However, space is definitely at a premium throughout the hotel, and the heat and noise (because of the heat) are unpleasant features of what was a largely enjoyable and informative trip.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cSurprised that this is what passes for a 4-star in Rome\u201d", "Author": "Paxlulu", "ReviewID": "UR119919839", "Content": "This hotel would definitely not be considered a 4-star by North American standards.

With such a short walk to the metro it's SUPER easy to get around Rome without breaking your wallet on taxi fare. I was thrilled at how easy it was to catch the metro to 95% of the sites we wanted to see.\u00a0 - My husband & I arrived from Fiumicino Airport. \u00a0We had arranged with the hotel for transfer service. \u00a0(Refer to their webpage for further information.) Because of the room we booked & the # of nights we were staying the transfer was free. Bonus for us! However, after learning how to use the metro it would have been equally as easy to arrive via metro & for a very reasonable fare (1 euro per person!)\u00a0 My recommendation for anyone arriving via airport, bus or train:\u00a0Use the metro & get off at the 'Termini' station. \u00a0The hotel is a short 2 blocks away & very easy to navigate...even with luggage. You will exit the station on the 2nd floor. Look for the McDonalds outside. Exit the station going left to the 1st street. \u00a0Take that up one block & turn left. This street will be labeled ___________. \u00a0The hotel is located on the left hand side of the street just past 2 or 3 cafe/ restaurants.\u00a0 Staff:\u00a0 The staff at Hotel Morgana was very pleasant and helpful. There was always a smiling face available to answer questions, help with info regarding metro & bus connections & recommendations for restaurants in the area, \u00a0what to do & how to make the most of your day in the event of a transportation strike, etc.\u00a0 Breakfast:\u00a0 When we booked, we chose not to add the breakfast option to our reservation. In our past travels we often found that breakfast at hotels in Europe (in our opinion) can be hit or miss & we didn't want to commit ourselves. However, we ended up eating the breakfast every morning at the hotel!! \u00a0We were very happy with the selection! Hot scrambled eggs & bacon, tons of bread options, meats, cheeses, cereals, juices, yogurts & fruit! Great way to start a morning before heading out to see the sites of Rome!\u00a0 Room: For the price, the location, the cleanliness & overall size & setup: I highly recommend this hotel! It holds up to its 4 star rating! The room had a \u00a0cozy, classic decor. Compared to American sized hotel rooms, this room would be considered small. \u00a0Compared to many other European hotels I've frequented however, I found this to be a good size, easy to move around & with a large bathroom! \u00a0Hotel Morgana was fantastic overall & I will be sure to stay here again in the future should I return to Rome. Amenities: -Great TV in room. There is one station that shows American movies which we enjoyed relaxing to after a long day of site seeing. -Quality hair dryer in the bathroom! \u00a0Really appreciated that!\u00a0 -WiFi: great option available but had major difficulty with connecting. It was our only complaint & frustration to speak of. \u00a0(There is an Internet spot on the corner near the metro if you need to get online.) -safe: nice feature! -laundry service: nice feature but VERY expensive.

They recommend you either try and find parking on the streets around the Hotel (good luck find one), using the parking meters or you can use the privately owned parkade which is FIVE blocks away and costs at least \u20ac17 per day (about $25 day CAD)!

The lack of proper maintenance has given the hotel room an \"unfresh\" appeal - the curtains, the bed cover, the tiles of the bathroom, etc. just looked like they had seen better days. So the nice pictures on the hotel website were probably taken when the hotel was first open, and unfortunately the hotel no longer looks that way.

I should mention that I took a month long vacation in Europe with my two children. As a woman traveling alone, a good hotel was important to me. I booked this hotel through priceline, since I have used them in the past. I contacted the Hotel a couple of days in advance via email to make sure the room would be a fit for all three during our stay. The Hotel staff was promptly responding to all my emails and my concerns. We finally arrived to Rome, and checked in at the Morgana. What a great surprise and wonderful experience to say the least. Miss Mariza at the reception desk was very professional, corteous, knowledgable and was pleased to address my needs. She mentioned that she would likely place me in a better room with a small extra charge for the extra bed. She was truly kind to us and gave us a very comfotable and nice totally remodeled Master room at the annex. We have stayed in several nice hotels, but this one for European standards was comfotable, spacious and very comfortable. We were very please that Miss Mariza was helpful and gave us that room for (7) days. Another highlight to our visit was the Bar. When we first arrive, we were informed of a few of the ammenities of the hotel. One of the is the Happy Hour (for the cost of a min 5 euro drink) we decided to give the bar a try that evening. We were pleasantly greeted by the bartender (Elmer). I would like to make a special comment to the supervisors and management (owners) of this hotel. Elmer takes a lot of pride of his work. He made us feel very welcomed every single day. My kids were lookling forward every evening to the happy hour to spend some time with Elmer. He was always trying to accomodate all our needs, special drink requests, and even recommending new things. We see how staff like him can draw more guest into a hotel. I am a firm believer that the comfort, location and ammenities of a hotel are important. But my strongest belief is that a staff member that goes above and beyond can change the view of your stay. I also want to mention that this hotel is place is a very good area. Super close to the metro and offers great safety. I was pleased to see their ring the door method. That way, you do not have people just walking in to the hotel. The security guard, Guiseppe was very nice to us as well. He was friendly, welcoming, professional and so courteous. He was a true joy that made us feel very safe. My kids were looking forward to see him every evening during our happy hour visit to the bar. The room expectations were great, clean, comfortable rooms, great decoration, hotel close to everything, you will feel just at home here. The Breakfast in the morning was really good. We didn't get to eat there every morning. We had it a couple of times only, but the staff was also corteous. If you are looking for a very comfortable stay at a great price, stay at the Morgana. I am looking forward to return to Rome and stay here in the future. I will not hesitate to recommend this great place to friends and family. To the Owners: Please make sure to make a special recognition to the high level of service provided by : Elmer, Mariza and Guisseppe. We were honored to be served by staff that makes travel and hospitality more enjoyable. High level of service like the one provided by the staff mentioned above, does not happen in every hotel. I am more than happy to forward a direct letter to you to validate the recommendation of this review. I stayed at your hotel for 7 days, and were the most wonderful during my one month vacation in Europe. Thank you Hotel Morgana, Y.

It's located very close to Termini, which was super handy when there was a taxi strike the day we were leaving Rome; we were able to walk to the train station to get to the airport. Having stayed in plenty of 5 star hotels, I would not give Morgana a 4 star,rather I think it is more like a 3 star.

We used this all week and never had any trouble at all. However avoid the rush hour if your claustraphobic. The hotel looks as though it has been upgraded. We had an executive room and although a bit small was perfectly ok, with a clean bathroom but only a shower. The breakfast was excellent with scambled egg and bacon ( or cooked ham not sure). There was a superb choice of meats, pastries etc. If you take any electrical equipment the normal two pin continental plug will not fit. The hotel has a three prong plug with the pins in a line. There are numerous eating establishments in the area with for example tourist menues. Three courses 12- 17E . Most Pizzas are the same price as home 7-10E but beer is expensive. We had a bottle of wine for 8E., but paid 5 for a pint. Being next to the station the area does look a bit run down but dont worry as every one is fine and friendly. If you inrend using the busses and visit museaums then look for a combined ticket as it could save you money. One metro trip is 1e and 4e per day buses and metros. St Peters and the tombs are free. Sistine and Vatican 15E. Watch the collosuem as touts try and get you in but you can get a ticket which combines the colloseum and the ruins opposite.

The breakfast was great - scrambled eggs & bacon, lots of different breads, cold meats, cheeses, three types of cake (my favourite bit) ,warmed croissants, cereals, yoghurts the list could go on, but you get my gist - the breakfast room got a little busy and we had to wait for a table for a little while (considering it was low season) so it may be a longer wait in high seasons ! The hotel is literally 1 block from Termini station - The area is not as run down as we had expected. You could easily walk to Colesium and Trevi fountain. 40 euros was the taxi fare from the airport- so quite reasonable. Overall for our short weekend break it was a good pick for a hotel - We would return .", "Date": "February 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kerry", "Title": "\u201cIf you want to stay in an actual hotel don't stay here!!\u201d", "Author": "stevewalsh1984", "ReviewID": "UR96979740", "Content": "We were extremely disappointed with the Morgana Hotel, Via Filippo Turati 33/37, 00185 Rome, Italy. We stayed for three nights from 12-15 February 2011. When we arrived we were told our room was not part of the actual hotel building but was situated down the street about 200 metres from the hotel in what the receptionist referred to as the \"Annex\". When you book into and pay good money for a hotel room you expect to stay in an actual hotel and not in a busy apartment block down the street with tenants staying on the floors above you and noisy shops underneath which stayed open til 1 o clock in the morning. There was no 24 hour security as stated on the hotel website and on numerous times when returning to the room the main entrance was unlocked. The phones in our room were disconnected which meant whenever we wanted to contact reception we had to walk up the street. We stayed in the \"hotel\" for 3 nights and on 2 of the nights we were unable to gain access to our room because our swipe cards were deactivated. This meant having to walk back down a busy street at night and go to reception to reactivate the cards. There wasn't even an apology from the receptionist for the hassle caused, it was as if it was our fault the cards wouldn't work. There was suppose to be a mini-bar in the room. There was a fridge (which didn't work)in the room which had 2 bottles of water in it. We asked on two occasions to be moved back into the main hotel building but were told there were no rooms available at that time and that the receptionist would contact us if one became available. They never contacted us. I would highly recommend staying clear of this hotel as the staff are extremely unhelpful and ignorant. The fact our room was not even part of the hotel was a major disappointment. Upon checking out we let the receptionist know how we felt about our stay and she couldn't care less.", "Date": "February 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cA perfect stay at the morgana hotel.\u201d", "Author": "Oldoff", "ReviewID": "UR96965174", "Content": "Just a few words to share with all of you what a great experience we had at the Morgana hotel.

But, no-one caused us any difficulties whatsoever and we were able to stroll the short distance to the hotel. A friendly night concierge (who speaks English) checked us in - provided key - but that is really where service ends there. We carried our cases to our room and found ourselves in one of the yet-to-be-renovated bedrooms on the third floor. For a city-centre (budget end) hotel it wasn't at all bad. Slightly on the small side, bathroom in need of updating (very small shower cubicle, no bath), but quiet and clean. Good value. Breakfast is good - not a particularly exciting spread, but certainly more than adequate to set you up for a day of sightseeing. Don't expect a lot of staff interaction - there isn't any. But, as in all other areas of the hotel's operation, everything seems to be well-organised and to flow without too much fuss. Exploring the city from here is easy. For the fit and able, walking is best - lots of the major sights are within a 30 minute stroll. For those who wish to be delivered to the sights - Termini Station nearby allows access to Metro, buses, trains and taxis - and (during the day) taxis are very reasonably priced (and as good entertainment value as anything that a fairground ride can provide - hold onto your hats). There are a number of small restaurants near to the hotel, but they are cheap and cheerful and don't add to the Roman Experience.

First of all, do not believe the hype about the location. YES, it is convenient to Termini station, and YES, that's nice because of the subway, but it is a fairly seedy area with vagrants walking on the street. I am a resident of NYC so it takes a lot for me to say something is a bad area... believe me, once you are off the exact little 1/2 block this street is on, you'll feel uncomfortable at night unless you're a young urban couple totally at ease with being in iffy neighborhoods. Think 40's/8th avenue in NYC about 10 years ago, lots of cheap souvenir shops, recent immigrants peddling on the street, etc. - not crazy dangerous, but certainly not great. I have my parents to worry about, senior citizens, and every time we come back to the hotel I stress out that something will happen to them. Hotel amenities leave much to be desired. My room is about 100sf total, my \"double\" bed is two twins pushed together. The 100sf piece is fairly common in EU, but still, a 4-star hotel with a room this small? (Comparison: Westin in Paris also has small rooms, but was at least 2x size of this room). My TV is an old 19\" that has no reception at all. No mini bar. no closet. Bathroom tends to flood but is fine. (pics enclosed of the room) The overall effect is something like an Econo Lodge or older 3-star hotel (think old holiday inn that wasn't renovated) in the US. Some of the decor is pretty (if rather tacky), and yes, the breakfast is pretty good. But there's no assistance in getting a cab/to attractions (yes, you can walk to Termini, and yes, that's just around the corner, but if I were in a proper 4-star hotel, I wouldn't have to - there'd be a bellman at the front to hail it for me - not that I need that, but sometimes my 70 year-old father does!) Net-net: If I had thought I had booked a 2 or 3-star hotel, I'd probably be totally OK with this place. The location is convenient to public transport which is great on a budget, the breakfast fills you up, the place is relatively clean. The problem is, I was told this was a 4-star hotel (actually I got sucked into this from Priceline by naming my own price - be warned!). And when I booked a \"4 star hotel in Central Rome\" I was expecting something like a Westin or Sheraton, or a very nice boutique hotel... not a hotel where I think \"Wow, I would have loved this when I was 19 and travelling on a budget\".

This hotel is definitely convenient to the main train station in Rome; it's an easy five-minute walk. However, the service personnel are surley and abrupt; the rooms are so tiny there is nowhere to open your suitcase but on the bed (then you have to pack it all up, zip it closed and stow it upright against the wall and hope you remember it's there if you get up at night to use the bathroom); the air goes off when you leave the room (like many hotels in Europe, you have to insert your keycard in a slot to turn the electricity on--but unlike most hotels, the air goes off, too.); the tub is so narrow at the bottom that you cannot stand with both feet on the bottom to take a shower (okay, I know this sounds silly, but unless you're a really tiny kid, you have to balance on the sides of your feet and brace them on the sides of the tub to take a shower); the water runs very hot to fdreezing cold with no warning; although the location is VERY convenient to the train station, it is in one of the worst parts of Rome for walking around at night, shopping or--God forbid, eating. The minute you walk out of the front dorr you are literally assaulted by waiters of the adjoining restaurants who try to stop you and convince you to eat at their restaurant. It's okay for a day or so, but after that, this becomes really annoying. We did not find this to be true in any of the other places we stayed in Italy. For most Americans, I would say this is a 2-star (maybe). So, check out the reviews carefully. You can do MUCH better than this place. We ceratinly did. One redeeming feature--besides the proximity to the train station--is the breakfast, if you have growing children who eat you out of house and home. The breakfast is hearty with a good selection of serve-yourself choices and the teenagers we saw there really took advantage of the wide selection of ham, cheeses, breakfast rolls, eggs, bacon. yogurt, cereal and fruit. Is it gourmet? No--but, it's decent and the kids won't have to eat until dinner time. BIG TIP here: get everyone up and down to breakfast early! Do NOT wait until the last half hour or so of the serving period or you'll find yourself crowding around the doorway and sitting all over the steps waiting with the other sleepy-heads (and their starving children). The tables will all be full, the coffee will be hours old and lukewarm, the wait staff is furiously bussing tables (rather than getting you coffee or finding you a clean napkin) and the food selection is lousy (all the good stuff is gone and won't be replaced).

Once arrived the friendly staff had us take a seat in their large lounge provided with couches, tabels, menus for snacks and drinks which was all exactly what we needed after our long journey to get figured out for the moment. 15 minutes later they had us all checked in (the front desk staff work at the speed of light), and were bringing up baggages for those who needed to our rooms which were all on the same floor. The breakfast hall was huge which allowed us to enjoy the scrumptious italian breakfasts all together. The hotel helped us organize buses that would come pick us up right at the door (!!) and take us on really grand tours around the vatican and rest of rome. We even got to see the Pope!!!!! The rooms were comfortable and overall this hotel was extremely accomodating and helpful with our tricky situation.

I tried to give this hotel credit because it's obvious they're trying to keep the hotel up to good standard, but failing. The the front-desk staff were very helpful and friendly, and that's the best thing I can say about the hotel. The lobby was (deceivingly) classy and check-in was the last time we felt good in the place. A friend stayed in 323 (single), me and my partner in 312 (double). Our flimsy key-cards would only work in every 1 out of 10 tries, and other times not work at all. We went back to the lobby several times to get the keys re-activated, sometimes still didn't work. The maid let my partner into my friend's room when he wasn't there, which was convenient for us, but in retrospect didn't make us feel secure. All of the nonsense trying to get working key-cards was the last thing we needed after a difficult journey. The rooms have a cheap feel, as though someone tried to fix them up but did it as cheaply as possible. The rooms look nice in photos (ours looked nothing close to the photo here on TripAdvisor) but up-close there is a musty, dusty feel to everything. The walls are decorated with this carpet-like fabric that collects dust that would drift around whenever we touched the walls. The in-room safes couldn't be activated in either room. The door to the rickety full-length closet in 323 fell off when I opened it -- a heavy slab of wood that could have hurt or injured one of us if we were in the wrong place. The beds were not terrible, but less comfortable than we expected from a hotel -- mattresses felt old or cheap. Some fixtures were new, but the toilet tank in 312 made industrial-strength groaning noises for a couple of minutes. The fridge was unusually noisy and we had to unplug it. The wi-fi costs 10 euros a day, which is like a month of net access back home. I searched for a signal and my laptop could find none, which makes me think it would have been problematic if I paid for it anyway. We got a card entitling us to complementary breakfast, but when we went down in the morning, our room was on the \"pay\" list and we were told the complementary-card was a mistake. That's the kind of mistake that would cost them nothing to honour, so being turned away was one more thing that made us feel unwelcome. We dropped into Una Hotel nearby (which is even closer to the train station) and considered splurging there for our second night. Although we didn't, I have to say it looked luxurious -- the only nice-looking hotel in this area, as far as we could see.

Every single person or couple who entered this Morgana hotel had to wait in a filthy reception for at least 20 mins because the rooms were always not ready and we, as any other travellers coming to Rome, had just arrived from the airport and looking forward to start our holiday which left us very disappointed given that the hotel knows we're arriving at this time in advance (which is in the normal check-in hours i.e after 2 pm). Third, the most disgusting room we have ever been to...!! We have found WORMS and INSECTS in some parts of the room (near the wardrobe and behind the mini bar) which was unbelievable especially in a 4 star hotel that cost 150 EUR per night (which now I confidently cannot give it more than 2 stars... if I'm generous!)

A 15-20 minute walk will take you to the main tourist hotspots and we never had to take a taxi or tram once during our stay, yet covered most of the sites. Even the walk to the stadium was only about 45-50mins. As for the hotel itself, it is very clean and has a certain character about it. A quick read in the visitors book will show that all nationalities use the hotel and there were very few negative comments. The only major negatives we had were around the size of the room (400). Lets just say it only took the cleaner 30 seconds to hoover the small patch of carpet in the room. We maybe struck it unlucky, but our double room would not even be classed as a single in some hotels. The smallest, most uncomfortable bed, that you could only get into from one side, as it was jammed up against the wall on the other side. There was one tiny wardrobe hid away in a corner that was about 4ft tall, which we didn\u2019t even try to use. Saying all that, I am of the opinion that we don\u2019t go away to spend all our time in the hotel room and we were rarely in it. If we had of wanted to do that and have a larger room, we would have spent our money in a more expensive hotel.", "Date": "February 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and excellent value for money!\u201d", "Author": "30statesJo", "ReviewID": "UR23702562", "Content": "Spent a January weekend break with a large group of friennds at the Morgana.

We stayed in Rome at the start of our trip then traveled south to Sicily and worked our way back up to Rome for our last night. The last place we stayed was Hotel Morgana for one night. What a welcome change it was. It is a very clean and beautiful hotel! The beds are comfy and the rooms are warm and quiet. The showers were clean and big with a nice bathtub and hot water that lasted forever. The service is beyond what we had anywhere else in Italy. The price was very good too. We had two adjoining rooms for the 5 of us and only paid 175 euro for the night. We had free wifi from anywhere in the building...including our room. In other hotels we had to pay for the wifi and only use it in the lobby. My teen was thrilled to use her laptop and catch up with friends after being out of touch for the last two weeks. I didn't have to worry about her being down in the lobby alone because she could use it from the room. The breakfast was excellent. It was in a very pretty room with big comfy chairs and great service. It included scrambled eggs and meats and lots of other choices that we had not seen before in more expensive hotels. The staff spoke very good english...which at this point in the trip was a nice relief to us. The hotel is within walking distance (2 blocks) to the termini train station...so no 30 Euro fee for a taxi. Before the trip I was under the impression that it was not a good idea to stay near termini. But it was fine and nice to be so close to the metro, buses, and trains to go anywhere in Rome easily. We had stayed near piazza navona at the start of our trip and it was nice to be on the little cobble stone streets in the quiet area of Rome. But I would not do it again since everything closes and you are away from the action. This hotel was safe and very beautiful inside.

We had booked a 'deluxe double room' through the hotel's website, and had a confirmed late check in. The room given to us was at best depressing - dingy, old and dirty carpets, shabby bedspreads and was so small (and no I am not complaining by American standards, I am aware of European hotel room sizes), I wonder what a standard room would have been! The bathroom was supposed to be designer marble with a Jacuzzi (as advertised on their website for a deluxe room) but it wasn't anywhere close to the pics we had we seen on the website. Okay, it had a jetted tub, but it wouldn't drain - worse even when you realize it at midnight with soap all over you! So we called front desk, and they sent someone to look at it half an hour later and refused to give us another room. The guy comes in around 12:30 am, and after 15 mins says he cannot fix it and needs a plumber to come in the next morning. He got rid of some of the water using a bucket but by no means we could have taken a shower there. I argued with the front desk, and finally they gave us keys to another room in the 4th floor (we were on the 2nd), to go take a shower in the morning! So much for the first night and if I haven't mentioned yet, the room was also a street facing one, so lots of noise! The next morning after much argument (they said they would fix the tub for us), they agreed to give us another room around 2 pm when they start checking in people. I must say the staff was really rude, never a word of apology, infact they were mad at us for complaining about the tub! The hotel manager even told me why am I complaining about the tub since I got a good internet price (130eu) - can you believe that? Anyhow, they supposedly gave us another deluxe room, which was even dingier, and the Jacuzzi had cracks and molds all over - we showed it to the hotel staff and so they finally agreed to give us an executive room !!! I think their deluxe room is a farce, don't book one, you may be better off with a standard or superior double. The executive rooms are quite good - they have nice clean, contemporary decor, feel bright and airy which was quite a welcome change! The breakfast is fairly good, their cappuccino is quite good (make sure you ask for it), the rest of the staff is Okay - don't expect American hospitality there! They did give me the complimentary ride to the airport (as part of the deluxe package deal for 3 nights), make sure you confirm your date and time at the front desk one day early else your ride may not be available on the day of your departure - I noticed they do not keep a record of it and when you go remind them, they put it down in their dairy! Overall, I would not stay there and if you did, I suggest you take an executive room - they sometimes give decent rates online. The termini area is OK, not as seedy as I had expected but then you have to be careful in Rome. My feeling is most of the hotels in the Termini area would be similar, Morgana is by no means a 3/4 star hotel.", "Date": "July 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cHotel Morgana .. great location but bit pricey!\u201d", "Author": "jcscSydney", "ReviewID": "UR17170519", "Content": "Hubby and I stayed at Hotel Morgana for 1 night the end of May this year, before flying out to Australia the next morning.

We had one of their \"Superior\" double rooms and although not exactly palatial the size of the room was perfectly adequate. The decor both in the room and generally throughout the hotel was very nice, though the fabric covered walls might not be to everyones taste, it was clearly well maintained and clean. The bed was comfortable although one minor gripe was the fact the mattress was two singles pushed together which can be troublesome. The only thing we would have added to the room would have been tea and coffee making facilities... The en-suite bathroom was very well appointed and quite large. Actually had a bath in it, which I was surprised at given how relatively inexpensive the room was, which made getting washed in the evening before going out again more relaxing. Staff were always helpful and courteous. The breakfast buffet was quite nice, with a largish selection. As for food in the evening there were quite a few decent places on the same street as the hotel for when you didn't fancy walking a long way (you really need to go to the place across the street once during your stay for the comedy maitre d'). Before I booked I had been quite apprehensive of the area as I had seen reports that it was a bit grim crime wise etc. but to be honest I found it about par for the course for a European city (no worse or better than London where I live).

The rooms were very small and a bit musty. Everything in the room looked like it was 20 years old, including the wall paper. Generally for the right price I can live with that, but the location of the hotel is not in a very convenient area. It is located two blocks from the train station which at night is a seedy area to be in. There are no restaurants or shops or bars or sites that one would want to go to within almost a half mile.

If/when I go back to Rome I would rather stay in the center of town, Piazza Venezia area, which is near all the major sites and restaurants.

If you do seek cheaper, stay off the main roads and look at the menus and prices before you sit down. The hotel is near the termini which is the base for buses and trains, however the hotel is sound proofed and the windows are covered to the extent to make an air-raid shelter blush so sleeping is a delight. The decor of the hotel is to die for, and so is the breakfast.

The reservations went without a hitch and the hotel included a free car transfer from the Fiumicini airport which was a wonderful start. The hotel is indeed only a block and a half away from the train station but you never hear any trains. The noise pollution in Rome itself takes care of that. I have lived in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Manhattan, and Amsterdam and I have never been in such a noisy city before. It's hard to hear yourself think, sometimes. One of the reasons we booked this hotel is because of the photo's on the website and the fact that they are one of the only hotels in central Rome that offer a family room for 2 children. At 200 euro a night I expected more room for the money. We chose a 'superior' room and got a family room for 3 people with an extra bed shoved up as close to the beautiful old large radiator as possible. The entire room can not be more than 3 x 3,5 and that with 4 beds, a large desk, and a nightstand. (see photo) On the third night, due to the lack of space and unspent energy, our youngest son fell and bumped his head on this radiator causing us to spend an hour in the emergency room at Umberto I hospital and resulting in 2 stitches. The photo's lead you to believe that everything has recently been refurbished and it has, I believe, but the carpet and tapestry that is stapled overall only creates a smothering atmosphere, especially if you suffer from allergies, so be warned. The staff is very friendly but not overly and the breakfast is very simple and the same everyday. We are used to only bread and cheese breakfasts but the quality of food here we felt left a lot to be desired. The hotel is very central but be sure to ask for a room at the back of the hotel. Our room was located in the front and the noise stopped at 1-2 a.m. and recommensed around 6 a.m. The area is a bit seedy and maybe it's just me, but I found a lot of Rome to be borderline seedy and very dirty, not just around the station.

The bathrooms are of average size and the only complaints we had about the bathroom was the tiny shield that was supposed to keep water in the shower. The first night the bathroom was practically flooded because the water pressure shot the water over the small shield (we learned after that night and it wasn't such a problem). The breakfast buffet is good the first two days, but it NEVER changes. By the last day (we where there five days) my husband and I almost cracked ourselves up because we knew exactly what food to expect. I would recommend venturing out for breakfast after the first two days, especially if you don't enjoy eating the same thing every day. Free or not, it eventually is not worth it!

Oh...... and with it being close to Termini station, it means you can get the early train to the Vatican, or Colloseum, or Spanish steps or.........", "Date": "July 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "H\u00f8jbjerg, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cFantastic, but be aware of location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3445780", "Content": "If you're going to Rome, then you should be aware that it is easy to arrive to- and depart from a hotel in the Termini area. And it is nice to have the the central bus station and metro close by. But it isn't terrible close to most of Rome's attractions, and thats our major complaint about this hotel (as well as any hotel in the Termini area). A minor complaint is the small rooms. We thought that when the reviewers spoke of small hotel rooms, it had to do with big americans beeing used to the fact that everything is bigger in the U. S. of A. -- but after having spent 7 nights at Morgana, we totally agree that the rooms are small. Other than that, we had a very-very nice stay. Front desk were very nice and sweet, everyone were easy to understand and speak to (not every italian speak fluently english, to say the least). The rooms were clean, the breakfast buffet were great (and we likede the opening times in the breakfast lounge - it closed at 10:30, which is pretty late compared to most hotels - at least in the northern part of europe). The area around the hotel seemed very safe. We felt very secure - both day and night. All in all a very pleasant stay, and we would absolutely recommend the hotel to others.", "Date": "May 6, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Morgana", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d203086-Reviews-Hotel_Morgana-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$123 - $283*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Filippo Turati 33/37</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00185</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "203086", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/1c/49/53/guestroom.jpg"}}
