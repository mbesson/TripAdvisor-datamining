We stayed here for two weeks in September 2005. The hotel itself is beautiful - the impact on arrival was a stunning hotel with amazing facilities.September is very quiet - there were barely any other guests there the whole time, which some may like, but we found quite disconcerting, and many of the facilities were not open as a result (pizza restaurant, poolside bar). You are quite a distance from anywhere, although the hotel does run free daily shuttles to the beach and to the local supermarket (the hotel is some distance outside of the gated area of true Nusa Dua).Th real part of Nusa Dua is VERY expensive. We ate at one of the hotels one night (our first night - never again!) and paid as much to eat and drink (if not more) than we would have done in the UK. After that we paid for a taxi to Sanur or Kuta every night - a fair distance, although not too expensive if you get a metered taxi.That is a good point to mention - ALWAYS get a metered taxi or ask what the fare will be BEFORE you agree to travel - unmetered taxis can cost twice as much as metered. You can ID metered taxis by the blue bird on the top. Villa Sekar Nusa has friendly staff - sometimes a little too friendly. One hotel manager was quite pushy in getting us to use his 'friend' to taxi us around the island - when we disagreed we were woken at 6 am with repeated phone calls from reception saying his friend was there waiting to transport us, even though we kept saying no.We would not use this hotel again. Although quiet, it was a little too quiet - friendly, but a little too pushy - tranquil location, but too far from ANTHING else.", "Date": "Jan 14, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR773529910", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "NTZ"}, {"Content": "\u9289\u693c\u5135\u9288\u3083\u5125\u9289\u7b3a\u5113   showReview(19955120, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 18, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR287032326", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9289\ue042\u5069\u9289\u7b3a\u5113\u59d8\u6940\u578e\u9288\u6393\u30bd\u9287\u693c\u500b   showReview(19954937, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 20, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR866068811", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u951b\u621e\u7866\u9287\u693c\u4f28\u9287\u693c\u4ee7\u9286\u509e\u5134\u705e\u5b28\u4f05...   showReview(19956096, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 18, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR623241359", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "0", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9289\u5c7b\u505f\u9289\u5908\u5049\u9288\ue76c\u4f04\u6942\u6a3a\u5f74\u9287\ue0a0\u4e97...   showReview(19955905, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 9, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR542444301", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "0", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1191333-d307565-r6749463-Sekar_Nusa_Resort-Nusa_Dua_Peninsula_Bali.html", "HotelID": "307565", "Price": "$152"}}
