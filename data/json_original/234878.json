We got a special rate including breakfast, but with the mediocre TA reviews, we were a bit apprehensive. As per other comments, the location is really excellent. There are 2 buses which run from Tegel Airport which drop you less than a couple of hundred metres away from the hotel, and it is near U- and S-bahn stations, so getting around is a breeze. We didn\u2019t find Berlin that big, so walking to a lot of places was a viable option generally too. The Ku\u2019damm has tons of high end shopping, and a good supply of bars, restaurants and cafes offering something to suit every budget. There is a bar right across the street from the hotel which we can recommend for drinks and reasonable food. There are also a few fast food joints towards the Zoo Station (5 minutes\u2019 walk), and some convenience stores. There is a large supermarket near Zoo Station called Ullrich. Very convenient, with a massive range of reasonably priced alcohol, but just be careful of the derelicts and drunks that seem to congregate around the entrance all the time \u2013 we had no trouble with them, but the smell is not pleasant! Don\u2019t miss out a visit to the KaDeWe department store (about 10-15 minutes\u2019 walk towards the city centre), and you MUST visit the 6th/7th floor food hall where all the delicious food and drinks are, including a range of superb live food stations. Seriously, you have to eat there at least once. Heading the other way, take any of the many buses 6 stops to 100 Ku\u2019damm, the \u201cHouse of 100 Beers\u201d from all over the world, plus they also do some very tasty and well priced German food. The hotel is pretty old (there is a photo of the hotel dating from 1955, and it is probably even older than that), and in some ways it shows its age. The lobby and mezzanine lounge area give a very modern and trendy feel, but the rest of the hotel is rather tired and dated. The stairway carpets are threadbare in places, and presuming that they are not protected by some government preservation order, the old wooden windows with flaking paint also need to be redone. They still even have actual door keys on large heavy metal fobs that you have to hand to reception every time you go out. I can\u2019t remember staying at a hotel with that system since the last century. On booking we were upgraded to an executive room opening onto the interior courtyard, and it was quite spacious with 2 very big wardrobes. You did feel that you had just stepped into a 1980s time warp though, with the pale wood (actually, laminated MDF) done in a whitewash style. The room had a weird layout, with the bathroom on the left immediately on entry and a wardrobe on the right, and a 1980s glass door at the end of that corridor which led to the main room. The TV is tiny, no more than 12 or 14 inches, and the channel selection is poor \u2013 about 10 German channels and 1 English news channel, and no pay per view movies. The wooden floorboards under the carpet creak and squeak unmercifully, so there is no quietly sneaking to the bathroom at night so you don\u2019t wake your partner. The bathroom was fine, even good, but it was an interior bathroom with no natural light. There was decent size bath and the shower was hot with good water pressure, even on the 4th floor, and the towels were good quality, although the toilet tissue certainly wasn\u2019t. The room was clean however, as was the hotel in general. Our main complaint about the hotel is the unbearable temperature, even though the heating was not switched on. Even in autumn with temperatures at 10c and below while we were there, the hotel was like a hothouse. The only way to stay comfortable in the main room was to have the old wooden windows wide open \u2013 both sets, as there are exterior and interior windows. Even then, it was still warm, and there can be plenty of noise coming from other rooms or the terrace area below which then just echoes around the courtyard. Having the windows shut was simply not an option. My wife is like a lizard, craving sun and warmth, but even she found it too warm. The interior bathroom was like a sauna \u2013 you would literally come out sweating if you spent more than a couple of minutes in there. The hotel must be an absolute nightmare in the summer. Another gripe is the lifts \u2013 we thought there was only 1, and it was very slow, so at peak times we just used the stairs. However, we discovered a 2nd lift at the back of the hotel, but it stops at the mezzanine floor which means you have to walk all the way round and down a flight of stairs. For some reason the staff never mentioned it was there, but it is only really relevant if you are at the back of the hotel. The final gripe is wifi is 5 Euros per day but you can only access it in the lobby or mezzanine lounge area. There are some very cheap cybercaf\u00e9s nearby however, and Starbucks 100m up the road is free. Breakfast was fine, with a wide selection of hot and cold food to suit everyone. There is no live station though, so the eggs are either scrambled or hard boiled, and the bacon was very greasy and not good. That aside, everything was great, and the service efficient and with a smile. We found all staff \u2013 reception and housekeeping too \u2013 efficient and friendly. So, great location, decent room rate and breakfast, very average rooms and hotel facilities generally, and more like a 3 star than a 4 star. The biggest thing they need to do is install some air-conditioning as part of a full refurbishment. If we could get the same reduced rate again we would probably stay there again as Berlin is not a cheap city for hotels, but we would not pay the normal rack rate, and we would certainly not go in the summer unless there was aircon.", "Date": "December 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, Russia", "Title": "\u201cit was definitely not a 4 star hotel! only 3\u201d", "Author": "Nadezhda_Nadezhda", "ReviewID": "UR87623659", "Content": "good location is the only advantage. old hotel, terrible bathroom. unfriendly reception staff ! ask for a nonsmoking room, i got a horribly room smelling of tobacco.", "Date": "November 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Swansea, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood location, great breakfast, clean room, comfortable\u201d", "Author": "Deb105", "ReviewID": "UR84925941", "Content": "We stayed 3 nights at this hotel.

The room was very small to boot.. On deciding it was not right for us, we had no trouble at reception asking for a double room and were given a much larger room with twin beds pushed together. The bathroom was newly re-fitted and very clean. The room was somewhat characterless and rather empty but was generally fine. The pillows were not old but virtually wafer thin with no spares left in the room (you get one pillow each) but apparently reception would provide extra pillows if you ask.... From these two things, we were starting to get the impression with this hotel that better standards are available - but you get inferior things offered first until you actively ask for better! There was a fully stocked minibar but sadly nothing to make a morning cuppa with. Breakfast was hugely expensive - we paid 34 Euros for two people and decided to go for Starbucks the next day instead. The buffet breakfast was tasty and had lots of choice though. Location extremely good for shopping but you'll need to get on the u-bahn or s-bahn for a feww stops to get to many of the main tourist attractions. Nice cosy lounge area in the hotel, lit with little tea lights in glasses and some comfy chairs too. It is however, a lounge - not a bar, and you need to press a button on the wall to get someone to fetch you a drink from the little menu as opposed to having a bar open which you can approach at will..

Luckily we got a room facing the courtyard so we were shielded by the noise from the street although wecould clearly hear the trains in the background but it was alright, you could sleep through it. Of course there wasn't any AC but we did have a fan upon our arrival but it really didn't do that much. I understand there's no AC but i still could not understand how the hotel could be at least 10 degrees hotter than it was outside even when the outside temperature was relatively cool and windy. Like other reviews have pointed out, yes the carpets are old and stained but it didn't really bother me. We had a minibar in the room and we took out all the stuff out so we could store some water but it rarely kept anything cool. Despite the bathroom being \"old\", i liked it. Ok, there are old beige-ish tiles but it was really big compared to other european hotels i have stayed at before and i like the extra space. The towels were changed every day and the trash was also emptied out. The only thing that i hated were the beds and the non-existant pillows, it literally broke our backs every day. It really was pure torture!!! THe beds were hard and some were bulky while the pillows were for the most part flat as pancakes. Taht single experience is enough for me not to return there for more than a few days. The curtains are see-through so you do get light in early in the day and the sun straight into the room in the afternoon.We did not have breakfast at the hotel but there is a bakery shop just a few seconds from the hotel with great eats. About the service, they did their job ok and have not met one that was too surly. So all in all, our experience was alright despite the horrible heat in the end of our stay and the horrible beds we had to sleep on. Like i've said before, i had read the reviews for this hotel beforehand so i wasn't too surprised with little things like stained carpets and the no AC.

This writer can only comment on our experience so with that in mind ... Judging by the usual criteria for hotels in Northern Europe by and large this hotel is NOT 4 star the facilities being rather limited. Despite what you might read in the blurbs there is no air-conditioning in the accepted sense of the term in the public areas. We found one portable air-conditioner in the first floor lounge and it was usually turned off despite outside temperatures of 22 deg C plus. There is definitely no air-con in rooms. Our son had a fan in his room but we had to wait until the second day for one to come available from a guest having checked out. On arrival at about 5 o'clock the temperature in our room was 89 deg F. Our rooms on the 5th floor, 527 & 528, were at the front of the hotel looking out onto Kurfurstendamm Str and our only option to avoid suffocation was to leave the door on to the balcony (a rather precarious perch to say the least) open all night. While this eased the heat a bit (down to 80 deg F by morning) the noise from outside was extreme, traffic, revellers etc., until 3 am and later - fortunately for me I had ear-plugs but my wife cannot wear them so had extremely disturbed sleep. As for the room itself: the carpet was heavily stained, and the room layout was unusual to say the least, there were two single beds arranged as right angles to each other with a lollypop shaped table affair between them; while the room was cleaned every day change of bed linen was an option which could be requested rather than a norm; there was a most unpleasant smell in the bathroom (which was itself quite nice); for English speakers the only chanel on the rather antiquated TV was CNN so pretty poor. Our deal was room only and we intended to pay for breakfast separately; on arrival we were offered a \"trial\" of two for one, which we accepted. The breakfast was buffet style catering for most tastes (e.g. scrambled egs, incinerated bacon, sausages, cereals, various yoghurts, fruit, cakes etc.) best described as average, but the price wasn't at 17 euro. The staff were pleasant enough but the tourist advice was frequently incomplete. The G-Lounge on the first floor is rather nice, however, references in descriptions of the hotel's facilities to hot and cold snacks and cocktails (and other drinks) being available is rather misleading; there is no bar in the hotel, rather the ladies at reception, from which the G-Lounge can be seen, keep an eye on whether guests are in the Lounge and pop up to take orders then disappear to some unseen location only to reappear later with ones order. I guess this is an example of multi-tasking (keeping overheads down).

If you want an ultra modern hotel to sit in all day instead of spending it outside seeing the sights, then go elsewhere. I agree with other travelers that the breakfast buffet was wonderful. A great selection of hot and cold food and fresh fruit. While there is no real bar, you can order a drink from the front desk and they'll bring it to you in the nice lounge area. Its a great place to sit and meet other travelers. The hotel even played films and pop concert videos up against the lounge wall. I think the hotel receives a bad rap because of the S-bahn train line that runs near it. I was actually on that side of the hotel and I can honestly say it didn't bother me at all and I slept really well. But if you are a light sleeper or spend most of your day in the room then I can see how it may be a problem. Overall, I was tremendously happy with Hotel Zoo. I intend to stay there again if I I get a chance to return to fabulous Berlin.", "Date": "November 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "US", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location!\u201d", "Author": "Global-Ally", "ReviewID": "UR21747661", "Content": "During a recent stay at the Hotel Zoo in Berlin, we had excellent experiences.

I had no choice about walking out to find an alternative hotel becuase we had paid up front. There wasn't even enough room for a tv stand, it had to be fixed on a bracket attached to the wall. I asked for a room with a bath and the only option was to upgrade - which costs a further \u00a3100 (120 euros). The breakfast was not included in this. If you want to buy breakfast upfront it costs 11 euros, but if you'd rather not make the decision until later or in the morning, you have to pay 16 euros each. we did eventually upgrade into a room which had limited day light and an artificial window on one side infront of a painted landscape. The day light effect was provided by a naked strip light! The carpet in this room too was dirty. There was a dead insect in the hallway which was there for the 3 days we were. The good thing was that the bathroom was in fact clean, but complimentary toiletries means there is a soap/shampoo/body wash all-in-one dispenser. There were no tea and coffee making facilities either. The 'business centre' had one computer which was engaged whenever we tried to use it.

OK, they no longer use AM but it is still on the building itself. Location: Very centrally located. 100 metres from the U-bahn and maybe a 5 minute walk from Zoo Station which has multiple U and S Bahn services. Shopping at your door step although most shops are high end or very touristic in nature. Clean and well lite area however so this area is fine. A walk to Potsdammer Platz is about 35 minutes with a few routes to choose from. The Tiergarten is nearby as well. Amenities: Pretty simple although I wasn't there to go for a haircut or spa treatment so I didn't mind. No gym but take the stairs and walk this city if you need a workout. I never ate at the restuarant or used the bar, just not my thing. For 14 Euros for the breakfast I also thought it was a little pricey. For 2 - 3 Euros I got amazing baked goods and excellent coffee from local bakeries which are plentiful everywhere. Don't forget to try the Currywurst on the street. Very delicous for 1 - 2 Euros. Room: I was travelling alone and my room had two single beds. I needed to use the duvet from the second bed as typical German duvets are not very long. There was a writing desk with two chairs, inroom safe, ample closet space in the hallway and a stocked fridge. Got the munchies one night and it cost 10 Euros and I only had a coke, some peanuts and the chocolate covered almonds. A bit pricey but then again I would be shocked to find a hotel mini-bar that wasn't expensive. Heating is of the water pipe variety so did hear some cluncking around of the pipes one night when the temperature dipped below 0. As I booked through a mass hotel reservation site, I got a room on the second floor at the back of the hotel. Not a great view although with 12 foot ceilings there was lots of natural light, besides I didn't go there too look out my window anyway. There was a train track about 150 metres from the back of the hotel but really wasn't bothersome at all. I actually found the rooms to be rather soundproof as well,unless there was noone else in the rooms next to mine. The bathroom was large but akward with the toilet roll dispenser almost touching part of the toilet. Very little leg room because of that, as well there was a moveable towel rock on the other side of the toilet further limiting freedom of movement. Cleanliness: I had no problems with the maid service and found the whole hotel to be rather clean. A Japanese couple were at the desk one evening complaining that he had been bitten by a bedbug however and had a few appropriately sized bit marks on their body. I had no problems with this however.

There's something for everyone at breakfast, if you can get breakfast included in the price it's very good value for money. Finding the hotel; * Getting to the hotel from Schonefiled Airport is easy. The train Station is easy to reach ( Look out for S-bahn signs) once you get there buy a ticket from the ticket machines (validate ticket before you get on the train) get the train to the Zoologischer Garten station, the hotel is a 5 minute walk away from this station. Tips; * Just around the corner to the left of the hotel is a tourist information. If you're going to be travelling around the whole city we'd reccommend that you buy a transport ticket that can be used on buses, trains or on the U-bahn, at around 17euros for 2 days this is great value for money (remember and validate your ticket) *Plenty of restaurants around, the HardRock cafe is a two minute walk down the street right in front of the hotel (ask the hotel staff for directions if unsure) and there's plenty of other restaurants to choose from. *If you're looking for a food store or supermarket the nearest one is about a 5 minute walk away from the hotel (Kaiser's). *If you're looking to visit the olympic stadium make sure there's not a football game on first as you'll not get to do the tour. *To see the best stretch of the Berlin wall (about 1.5km) get the train to the Ostbahnhof station and you're right there.

The hotel also offers \"quiet\" rooms to the courtyard which was a great plus when located on an otherwise busy boulevard. The room - as the hotel - is clean and well-maintained on a daily basis. However, it has not been touched, it seems, since the 1960's on any upgrades: beds, pillows, bedspreads, lighting, TV, internet - you name it. If retro-chic in its original state is what you are looking for, this is your hotel. Obviously there is a reason the hotel does not post room photos on its own website but leaves the impression of a bright, modern environment behind! Certainly not the place for a comfy shopping plus romance trip - the room is too sterile (though large) for that.

Staff were completely unhelpful and treated our request for a room change in line with our booking with a shurg of the shoulders! Room we had was cold and very noisy due to closeness of railway.

Our room was large and spacious, and had a particularly big bed, although seconding previous reviews the television is a little dated, and the only english channel is CNN! The room was immaculately clean and maid service was daily, we asked for 2 extra pillows on arrival and came back to find them shortly after, with a complimentary basket of fruit and biscuits which was very nice. Staff were always friendly and spoke good english. Location is superb, probably the best feature of the hotel, right on the Ku'damm, the bus from the airport (X109) stops right outside, and costs just 2.40 euros from Tegel Airport. Top tips *Breakfast can be found cheaper than the hotel at a lovely restaurant above the Gary Webber shop just a few doors up, and for half the price. *The Thai restaurant on the road behind the hotel 'The Elephant' is some of the best food i have ever had, and is very reasonable indeed. *KaDeWe is a must, and makes even harrods food court look small, great for a few glasses of champagne and some sushi! *The Zoo is a MUST, and not be missed at any time of year.

Fantastic location for discovering Berlin - situated right in the centre of Berlin on the main shopping street The Kurfurstendamm - a very nice part of town too it was! Upon entering the hotel you couldn't but notice how clean and inviting it was, decorated beautifully for Christmas and candles lighting throughout the hotel reception and G Lounge. Staff were friendly. Breakfast was super and the rooms were a good size, really clean and comfortable. They could do with a little updating but they were very well maintained and cosy. We got a super rate of 87euro per room per night incl. breakfast when we booked directly through the hotel website. Only thing to comment on was that some of the websites selling rooms at this hotel state it has a 24 hour bar but it doesn't and we were a little disappointed when we returned to the hotel at 1am for a nightcap only to discover that the bar closes at midnight - however the mini bar in the room was well stocked and was very reasonable so we could get over this!

The leaning staff are either incompetent or poorly managed, the room was not cleaned properly, the carpet looked like a bunch of frats boys had partied there the night before and believe it or not, we had to call down to the front desk for toilet paper - apparently if we wanted a full soap container for the shower or more than 1 roll of toilet paper we had to ask someone. also the room was incredibly hot as it faced south, had poor ventilation and no air conditioning (although i noticed some rooms beside did have air). Fortunately i spent most of my time seeing the sites of berlin so the room didn't matter that much, but i still expect a basic level of service.

The only draw back was the cost of breakfast in the hotel (14 Euro), we found a lovely little cafe in the street opposite the hotel which did a fantsatic breakfast for just 1 Euro!

The rooms were quite clean but warm even with the windows wide open at night. The small fan provided didn't really help much. No noise from the street however. The location of the hotel is excellent for U-Bahn and S-Bahn connections - there's a U-Bahn station within 50 metres of the hotel and Zoological Garden station is only 5 minutes or so away. There are plenty of restaurants within easy walking and a lively bar practically across the road where live music is played most nights. We found the hotel staff to be efficient but not particularly friendly but the biggest problem was that on one morning, the buffet breakfast was a bit chaotic. The choice of food was fine but there weren't enough staff attending to replenish the food choices as they ran out and there didn't seem to be enough tables for everyone.
