I'll be honest for the low price I was not expecting that much or overall an ok Resort, however I was wrong. Actually, it was great- these is the facts: - Great staff, friendly (in PR is very dificult to find a staff that is friendly and w/great customer service) -The room- we/got an ocean view and near the main pools- it was really good, clean and very charming. - The pools were really clean, jacuzzi's- the Hotel is pretty spacious. - I would consider this Resort for couples (wanting to spend time a great quality, quiete time) or seniors. Theres not that much to do for either young or teens. Like I said is very quiete. - Rest. food is okay (I have try great seafood in other places of the island) perhaps for burgers and appetizers will be a good alternative to use the rest. - I mean you do not have an option, if you want any fastfood rest outside the hotel- you have to drive a good 10-15 min out. -The beach- well is not really a swim beach- the water is very, very shallow- it was really clean- but if you want to soak your feet- that will be fine. I would highly recommend- read a great book or sleep and sleep, relaxing w/some great pina coladas!.

Beautiful and peaceful hotel. Clean rooms, very nice staff, great facility. 3 swimming pools (1-kids pool, 2 larger pools) and nice beach. Coin operated washer and dryer were surprise amenities - helped to fully dry soggy clothes from several days of island fun. Guanica is on the Caribbean and thus there are no crashing waves like the north side of PR. Blue waters and blue skies. Dry Forest BioPreserve surrounds the area and thus very little rain. Nice walking trails in the preserve, but be sure to take maps and water! Also, the insects come out at night...that's what you get when you are next to a nature preserve. The food is good and pricey but that is the norm at all hotels. The coconut mojitos were the best! We ate at the outdoor grill and never tried the fancy restaurant indoors, but it was highly rated. This is a good place to relax. We did not have time to scuba or snorkle; it will have to wait until next time.

The resort is secluded. It is very peaceful and family-friendly. The service was good. The staff was friendly and helpful, but they keep \"island time.\" The food selection isn't great as mentioned, but some of the dishes were really good. Only breakfast is buffet-styled. The other meals are by menu. The grounds were nice and well kept, but not spectacular. The seaweed on the beach didn't bother me. In fact, I think it draws in fish and allows them places to hide. We saw a nice variety of fish on the resort. Gilligan's Island was nice, but rather crowded with a party atmosphere every time we visited. Now the major complaints.....we felt that the all-inclusive was quite overpriced. Especially since they made it a point that tips were not included. You sign a bill for everything that you order, including drinks. Our room was bad. We stayed in Building 3. Saying that the room needed remodeling would be quite the understatement. The room was not kept clean. There were many battle scars in the room from the ongoing war against mosquitoes. There were some spiders living on the ceiling, but I didn't mind them that much because I saw them as allies in the war. We saw a centipede and a cockroach in the room. During our 5-night stay, the toilet clogged 3 times. The rooms badly need sound proofing. We heard the people above us when they moved furniture, the people talking outside in the neighboring patios, the people talking inside in the neighboring rooms, the people talking in the hallway outside our door, and especially the people getting ice from the ice machine located right outside our room. The loud AC unit did help to drown out all of this noise, when it was running. In conclusion, fixing up the rooms would go a long way to improving this resort, but we don't see ourselves returning.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cPeace and quiet and beautiful grounds!

Having been a frequent visitor for the last 18 years, we encountered this resort in better shape and condition than ever. It maintains its Caribbean plantation/South Pacific charm. The rooms are perfectly maintained and daily maid service is outstanding. All of they new units blend right in with the older ones which are kept in mint condition. The general ambiance at the resort is very peaceful and conducive to a graeat romantic getaway or a family vacation. There are two separate pool areas which contribute to different types of vacations. A big plus at Copamarina is the absence of a casino and motorized sports. There are numerous types of non-motorized water sports that can be arranged to be enjoyed at the dive shop. I personally do not dive but the resort is an important PADI base where divers go to several area sites. There are two restaurants, Las Palmas and Alexandra's. The latter was closed during those days but Las Palmas is good. The atmosphere is awesome and the menu is excellent. If you spent many days, be perpared to commute to some of the Guanica and Yauco restaurants, you may get tired of the menu. Breakfast is basically a buffet, unless there are a few folks checked in. You can opt for ordering a la carte. Copamarina feels far away and secluded, but it sits only 15 minutes away from Yauco's american style shopping centers. Las Palmas is a bit pricey but portions are good. If you order iced tea or soft drinks, be prepared to pay for refills; free ones are non existent. There is an excellent public beach adjacent to the property and try to go at least once to Gilligan's Island by boat which can be arranged at the front desk and costs $7 per person. Considering you are already there and the safety of the vessel, it is a pretty good deal. Pack a lunch if you are staying past noon at Gilligan's, a uniquely paradisical offshore island, five minutes away from Copa. Front desk staff will make every effort to makemyour stay as pleasant as possible.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cTotal Relaxation!\u201d", "Author": "Beachreader7", "ReviewID": "UR126913344", "Content": "We enjoyed our stay at the Copamarina March 5-12, 2012. We agree with the complimentary things said here on TA about the resort which is undergoing a million dollar plus update as I learned on Twitter @copamarina. I want to skip right to information I had a difficult time finding out about the resort so your stay can be as relaxing as ours. Getting to Copamarina: We rented a car (highly recommemded) at the San Juan Airport. Be sure you have a GPS as you will be driving on a 7 lane freeway which is like driving around LAX at rush hour. Have one person monitor the GPS carefully because it is easy to get off on the wrong exit in San Juan. Next you will drive over the mountains on a well maintained highway through terrain like I64 and I77 through West VA, complete with those semi runoff ramps. After you cross the mountains, it becomes drier and resembles the area south of San Jose, CA. Rt. 52 was a good road. Soon you will think you are driving through dry New Mexico followed by oil refineries in Ponce. There was a lot of road construction on 52 and 2 near Ponce, but traffic kept moving. You get a mini tour of the USA going to Copamarina. The road into Copamarina: We had no trouble finding #333 into the Copamarina. We made sure we arrived in the daylight after reading reviews here. It is twisty, but stay on your side when going around curves and cars can easily pass. White lines are painted on each side of the road. We thought this road was like driving on a country township road in Eastern Ohio. No potholes like Ohio, though! It has a very good surface. As you pass the big park, you will know you are almost there. Checkin: Very welcoming and well trained front desk staff will greet you and answer any questions. (They have a nice booklet about the Dry Forest Reserve next door.) Don't miss the cold water with limes on a table in the open air lobby. It is very refreshing. Check if your room safe will require an actual key so you don't have to go right back to the lobby. Laundry: There is one washer and drier which take quarters located near the spa. Las Palmas Restaurant: This is one of the areas that has recently been completely upgraded. It is beautiful and the views while you drink at the bar or dine are fantastic! There was a large scuba training event going on when we first arrived so dress was very casual--Tshirts and shorts. There was a lovely beachfront wedding Saturday night so some guests were dressed in just a bit more resort style then. All of the fresh seafood dishes were very good. Alexandra's was closed until the weekend , but dishes from it were suggested by the gracious servers each evening. The house green salad was huge and there is enough to share. I also made a meal from the spinach and club salads. The $12 breakfast fruit plate also was a great choice to share. The scrambled eggs portion size can feed a small family. I am still adding fresh, high quality cinnamon to top my homemade oatmeal here at home. Be sure to request it. Thank you, Copa chef! Best of all is the cafe au lait made with Puerto Rico's finest Yaucono coffee. (Yaucono or Alta Grande are also provided in the rooms for the coffeemaker.) You will enjoy the sun sparkling on the water at breakfast and the sound of waves during your candlelit dinners. You can see Jupiter and Venus shining brightly overhead in the wonderful dark skies. And as another reviewer noted, don't miss the coconut Mojitos! Groceries: The Economart in Guanica is quite the experience! You will see a huge Burger King sign as you drive on 116. Turn down the street right by the Burger King and it will take you down to Ave. 26 de Julio where you will find cars stalking the parking lot for a space. Go around the corner and park down the street by the arena. This is not just a little carryout; it is the grocery store heart of Guanica. We bought drinks, fresh fruits, and food for lunches. People at home warned us about prices in Puerto Rico, but food here in the countryside was priced similar to prices in Ohio. (Gasoline just down the street was 96 cents/liter.) The Yaucono coffee is behind sliding glass doors at the front by the checkout lanes. This coffee sells for $12 dollars for 8 oz. in gift stores in Old San Juan; it is $5 for 8 oz. or $3 for 4 oz. here at the Economart. Other guests said it was locked in cases by the checkouts in nearby Yauco. By the way, the Yauco shopping plaza is right by Rt. 2 so you can very easily find it, too! Swimming: I was able to swim laps in the main pool. The other pool is 3ft. 6 ins. deep so you can swim the breaststroke down the center. There are great clean hottubs that are not overly hot for meeting other guests and exchanging travel tips. If you want a perfect beach for lengthy strolls, choose Eagle Beach, Aruba or Cancun. If you want peace and a laid back visit, this is the place. We snokeled off the beach and pier. The much discussed sea grass is not slimy like \"seaweed\" found in Ohio and Michigan. There are plenty of starfish. Children had a great time in tide pools. Rooms: Bldg. 2 has been updated with new bedding and it looked like new tile floors. Good Wifi is included in the resort fee. We had a new large flatscreen TV with HBO and many channels. It is true that you can hear the neighbors through connecting doors. One night we think someone must have called the front desk at 10 PM, because the newly arrived neighbors tuned their happiness down as if someone had thrown a switch which made us laugh! We do hope to return with family to the well run Copa some day. We have made a lot of people jealous with our lovely photos.

With two large pools, we were quite happy. While there is a beach, it's more for sunbathing than swimming. The restaurant on-site was really good. We ate there all the time because it was a switchback hairpin drive to get to other places. It was outside, but roofed, with a great view and breeze. The top end restaurant at the resort was closed on the two days we were there, but we got some of their specials on the menu where we ate. The amazing thing was that there were so few people visiting there. It was perfect weather -- but I don't think they had 30 rooms with guests. The place is huge and must have well over 200 rooms.

This lovely sea side resort fit the bill. It is about 20 minutes from Ponce and an hour and a half from San Juan. The hotel had a perfect mix of young families, couples and retirees; as well as Puerto Ricans, North Americans and Europeans. The rooms are generic Caribbean, clean but somewhat dated. Our room was quite nice, but did have a door to an adjoining room. This was not a problem on the first night of our stay, but we did hear everything said and done in the room next to us on the second when it became occupied by a young couple. There are two restaurants on the premises, a outdoor casual one and a more formal indoor one. Both were excellent and quite reasonable for the quality of the food. You can order from the more formal restaurant's menu at the cafe. Other than these two, the local restaurant scene is practically nonexistent. You can ride into Guanica for a couple of places, but I suggest you call ahead to make sure they're open on any given day. We did walk each afternoon to the ferry landing (Gilligan's Island, I kid you not) for drinks, where my wife had the best Pina Colada of her life, and there is food available, but we did not eat there. Much has been written here about the quality of the beach. There is a lot of underwater vegetation right off shore. It is protected wetlands and cannot be cleared by the hotel. If this bothers you at all, there is an excellent public beach an easy 5 minute walk down the beach where you can swim without encountering the problem.

Or simply ask the server if there are any other options. We did, and were rewarded with delicious red snapper! 2. If you will just travel to and from the airport, don't bother with a car rental. If you wish to explore the area, by all means rent a vehicle.

This month we visited for a second time with our four year old daughter. What an awesome vacation! The Copamarina is super kid-friendly.

The pools and grounds are impeccably maintained. The rooms are not super luxurious but are perfectly adequate and very clean. You aren't going to want to spend much time in your room here! Las Palmas Cafe, the outdoor cafe where we had breakfast three times and dinner three times, serves good, reasonably-priced food. We particularly enjoyed the whole fried snapper (the pizza, which we ordered the following evening, wasn't the best -- the crust was tortilla-like and not our favorite). One of our favorite things was that there is a small playground right next to the tables at Las Palmas so our daughter could play while we were waiting for our food, scarf down her food, then skip off for more sliding and climbing fun while my husband and I relaxed, chatted and enjoyed a second delicious cup of cafe con leche! The beach is a little grassy and therefore not really suitable for swimming, though there is a better public beach just a few minutes walk away.

The service was fair - if you have travelled in PR, you'll be familiar with this. The rooms were great. They were large, and had either a balcony or a terrace. Each room had a fridge and a huge shower! One of the best parts was the fact that they had Aveda bath and hair products! The pools and hot tubs are a great way to stay cool. The beach is not that great, but if you have a car, take a drive and explore local beaches - you won't be disappointed. Our favourite part of Copamarina was it's direct access to Gilligan's Island!!! For $7US/person, Copamarina had a private shuttle (pontoon boat) to take you to Gilligan's Island. Gilligan's is a nature reserve in the middle of the bay. It has shallow warm water, and you swim through the mangrove to the open water. It is a fantastic experience, and you cannot travel to Guanica without going. We loved it so much, we went twice on the same week! Be prepared to take absolutely everything you'll need for the day. From food, to beverages, to chairs/towels etc. There are picnic shelter and grills - if it's a PR holiday, it will be packed, so book as soon as main reception opens.

It consists of several buildings along the ocean, pools, a hot tub, small playground, game room with air hockey, and two restaurants.

The hotel was in good condition \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it looked like everything had just been re-painted.

There are some patches of sea grass but easily avoided by either swimming around them, swimming off the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pier, or strolling down to the adjacent beach park. There were a few small fish, but no spectacular snorkeling right off the beach. The hotel does have kayaks and small catamarans, but we did not try these. They rent snorkels for $15/hour ($25 for the day). There is also a company that will take you snorkeling ($69) or snuba ($99) diving from a boat that leaves from the hotel pier. Our snorkeling trip was cancelled due to poor weather (must have been an issue with the currents as the weather was perfect). There is also a boat to Gilligan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Island that leaves every 30 minutes from the hotel pier from 10 am to 4:40 pm ($7). The pools are beautiful and clean. There are two hot tubs, two pools, and two shallow kiddie pools. The restaurant on site will serve drinks at the pool for the expected high resort price of about $8 each. The staff is helpful, polite and speaks English well. WiFi was free throughout the property \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including the beach which was VERY nice. Our room was in the main building, ground floor facing the ocean. It had a very nice back porch and we enjoyed sitting out, drinking rum, watching the sunset, and hearing the ocean. The room was large and clean with the expected amenities. There is a spa on site that we did not visit. The fitness room was a small room with two treadmills, some weights, stationary bikes, and a stair stepper. The equipment was in good shape and the fitness room was open 24 hours. The only downside to this location was that it is somewhat remote (that may be an upside to some!). There were few things to do in the immediate area. Guanica is tiny with no good restaurants. However, for a 2-3 day vacation, there was plenty to do such as the Dry Forest (ask for a brochure and map at the front desk) and Gilligan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s island. The restaurant on site was good but if you want to go out, you will drive for at least 25 minutes to find a decent place to eat. They add a 10% resort fee to your bill which I found distasteful.

Then they put us in building 4 - far from everything - not that its a big place but there were empty rooms everywhere. The resort wanted $240 p/person for transportation to the hotel so I rented a car. Then I understood why! It took 2 1/2 hours to get there and people drive crazy! The road into the resort is sooooo windy and narrow, it scared the life out of me and thus we were afraid to ever leave the resort. The area around the resort was extremely poor and I probably wouldn't have ventured out anyways. The food was good but the same everyday - only one restaurant for breakfast and lunch - two choices for dinner. The bartenders were very slow ,even with noone there - so if it had been busy you would have never gotten a drink. The beach was nice and so was the ocean, calm and swimable. Kayaks available and we took them to Gilligans island which was nice. But if we had to pay $12 to rent them (they were part of all-inclusive) it would not have been worth it. They also make you think the ferry to Gilligans Island is free - its not - $8 p/p. Pools and hot tub were nice but it was really BORING, because there was no one there and the people there were in their 70's. So, if you want to pay ALOT of money to be alone - this is your place.

Based on my family's week-long stay at Copamarina between Christmas and New Years, I can say there's some truth to both the good and the poor reviews. Experiences will vary, depending on your expectations and especially on whether you're looking on the outside (the hotel grounds and natural beauty) or just inside the rooms (which are average). At the resort, we waded in the ocean (yes, shallow with plants) and swam in the beautiful pools (yes, unheated and slightly chilly except for the two jacuzzi's) during at least some part of every day, and our kids loved it. Mostly, though, we used the resort as a jumping off point for day trips around the southern and western parts of the Island (e.g., the picturesque Cabo Rojo lighthouse, stunning Playa Sucia beach, the charming hill town of Adjuntas, hiking and chasing waterfalls in the lush inland forests, etc). Our main concern in planning to stay at Copamarina was food, because we did not go \"all inclusive.\" We paid $265 a night per room (we had two rooms), and the all-inclusive package would have added another $200 or so per day, which seemed unreasonable. But everything worked out okay. The rooms have mini-fridges and coffee makers, and after asking several times over the course of a couple days, the resort put a microwave in our room, because we have a baby and needed to heat milk, but it came in handy for other things, too. (Remember to bring a bottle/can opener.) We wound up eating at one of the resort's restaurants only once. In nearby Guanica, there's an Econo market with everything you can imagine, plus a McDonalds and Burger King (though we managed to avoid both), and a couple good but cheap local bakeries that sell pastries and sandwiches. Several times for dinner, we drove 15-20 minutes to the town of La Parguera, where there are several places to choose from (we highly recommend Moon's Tapas). A word about diving: We dragged scuba gear with us, but never got to use it because the weather, although sunny, was too windy with high ocean swells. You can book diving (and snorkeling or snuba) tours through the resort, which now uses an apparently brand new operator called AquaAdventures, run by a friendly guy named Jose, though they weren't very good about returning messages and letting me know the status of whether the dives were cancelled or not. On a final note, Puerto Rico has amazing natural beauty (no visit is complete without driving through the mountains and getting lost at least once -- even with GPS), and everyone we encountered at the resort and everywhere else was very friendly and helpful. Even the policeman who pulled our car over (for reasons we never learned) immediately apologized and let us go as soon as he saw we were tourists.", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Charles, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cDont go to this place !!!\u201d", "Author": "jeanneschulz60", "ReviewID": "UR122843922", "Content": "Just got back from copa marina beach resort in puerto rico. and I must say I was very dissapointed!

After dropping our luggage off in our room, we wasted no time in heading to the terrace for a drink and light dinner to discuss our options. The only negative here is that we were bitten by mosquitoes, and we wish we had put some bug spray on before we sat down. We could have had dinner indoors in the restaurant, but we really liked being outside by the beach. After eating, we saw that the water activities hut was still open, so we asked a few questions about kayaking and promptly decided to do that instead of hiking. Actually, I had decided I wanted to kayak a while back, but my husband loves to hike and needed a few reality bites from the mosquitoes (which we received at dinner) to change his thinking. So, the next morning we asked for a late check-out (from noon to 1pm) and kayaked to Gilligan's Island, where we saw lots of fish in the crystal clear water. We kayaked through narrow passageways in the mangroves where we were all alone. It was wonderful!

Gilligans Island was a little disappointing. It's basically a bug filled island full of trees and iguanas and the jellyfish were out in full force. Fun for 2 hours or so, but nothing more. Take water and bug spray with you-there are no facilities there. The food was typical resort food. Alexandras was closed and there were special events over the weekend so it was unavailable to eat in. Las Palmas has an OK menu but is very limited so after the 4th night we started running out of things to eat. But you have to try the conch fritters. Super tasty. Breakfast was great especially the tropical fruit plate. The drinks were definitely watered down, so if you're looking to get a buzz on, drink beer or watch them open a new bottle of liquor. It was almost frustrating. The last night and day we stayed was the weekend and it started to get pretty crowded but before that there were few people there. The grounds are really nicely kept and the greenery surrounding the pool (especially the one near the club house) is absolutely beautiful. If you like to have snacks or drinks at night, make sure to hit up the little shop before 6 because that's when they closed during the weeknights and everything is of course, astronomically priced--$15 can of sunblock! Yikes! Just stock up before you go. Also, the bar/outdoor restaurant closed as early as 9:00 one night we were there even though they say they are open later. All in all it was a nice place to stay...not perfect but perfectly relaxing and quite beautiful.", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Paul, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cReally liked it there!\u201d", "Author": "bkshores", "ReviewID": "UR120106524", "Content": "This is a lovely spot.

All in all, it was a lovely spot in which to spend a few days. However, we felt at times as if the resort were having an identity crisis. The prices, and aspects of the ambience, suggest a desire to be a high-end resort. The setting was certainly spectacular enough to support such aspirations. A few details still need to be worked out, however, before we would feel that the high-end prices ($850 per night plus tax and resort fees) were warranted. First: despite paying a 10% resort fee, we discovered that everything required more fees or deposits. $15 per towel as a safety deposit (refundable if you return the towels), $20 per hour for kayak rentals...it adds up, and makes one chafe at also paying a resort fee. Second: our rooms were cooled by air conditioners that were louder than any I have ever heard in my life. It sounded, quite literally, as if an 18-wheeler were idling in our room...we could not hear each other speak while it was on. In a budget hotel, I would happily tolerate this kind of of thing. But at high-end prices, I would think an investment in new, quieter AC would be warranted.

Our trip was during the last week of July, 2011. We reserved an Oceanview room, but the front desk allowed us to take a look at the oceanview and the beacfront rooms, in case we wanted to change. Both room were beautiful, but we stuck with the Oceanview. The grounds are immaculate, full of beautiful Plumeria trees and bouganvilla. There were also mango, coconut and grapefruit trees. The grounds alone would be reason to visit Copamarina! We chose the \"All-Inclusive\" package from the resort, which was a bit more cost effective for our trip. The meals are a bit pricey from the 2 restaurants. The meals were nice, and I suggest trying the mofongo with grouper from the Palms Cafe(outdoors). Breakfast was the nicest, with an assortment of frsesh fruits, pastries, pancakes, omelettes, etc. And delicious coffee! Watch out for the lizards the sneak underfoot to grab morsels of food! My only complaint was the wait staff at the outdoor cafe. They are VERY laid back. So be prepared to wait for servive. Getting a drink at the bar was also frustrating. I suggest ordering several at once, as to not get your buzz killed. My favorite was the Puerto Rican Iced Tea! The beach at the resort was amazing! The beautiful blue waters and the palm trees beg you to relax... There were plenty of lounge chairs, beds (yes, beds!) on the sand for you to relax. Water sports available are kayaking (fun), snorkeling and wind surfing. There was also a bot to Gilligans Island, but a bridge was broken at the time of our trip, so the Coast Guard closed it until it could be repaired. : ( There is a nice public beach in walking distance, if you want to grill.

First we were thinking about Mexico, but one of our kids had an expired passport, so we had to settle for Puerto Rico. It was the best decision. It was an easy 2 hour flight from Atlanta with no hassles with immigration and passports. The people are super friendly. The hotel is on the caribbean side of the island, which means the weather is warmer and the ocean is beautiful. The hotel's architecture is what you want on a beach vacation, tropical looking, relaxed with gorgeous gardens. The reception doesn't even have walls, the weather is so nice. The rooms are nice, the beds not so soft, but we noticed that the day we were leaving there was a big truck with new mattresses. Across the beach there are absolutely gorgeous islands to go snorkling. The water is calm and safe, perfect for little kids to learn how to snorkle. The water is so clear that back home people thought I was filming a swimming pool. There are kayaks to rent, you can play volleyball, and rent snorkle equipment. The beach right in front of the hotel has a lot of vegetation, but you should walk on the pier and jump on the water. It is crystal clear, and like a giant swimming pool. Fabulous! If you walk the sand stretch from the hotel you will find a public beach where the locals go and it is perfect for little kids. If possible remember to go during the full moon so you can swimm at night in the bioluminescent waters. Out of this world! The restaurant is pricey. We bought food at the grocery store and kept snacks and breakfast food in the mini fridge. The local restaurants in town are reasonable and you can get cuban sandwiches at the bakery for about $2.50. During weekends the hight life is very lively in the little town. Lots of dancing and live puerto rican music. I have 3 teens and they had a blast.

If you are looking for stuff to do late at night, you will not find it here: this is a place for relaxing. The beach in front of the hotel itself is mucky, as it is adjacent to a mangrove swamp. At times the smell of the swamp gets to the hotel. On the other hand we got to see some of the amazing birds, no doubt due to the proximity of the mangrove. A short walk away is Ca\u00c3\u00b1a Gorda Beach which is nice, and the hotel has a private shuttle boat to beautiful \"Gilligans's Island\" (Cayo Aurora, officially). Gilligan's can get very crowded on weekends, beware- get there early. We have stayed several times at this hotel: the service has been outstanding and the facilities impeccable always. The all-inclusive package is worth every penny. The one time we did have a problem with our bathroom somebody from the hotel staff was there to check it in less than 5 mins, and when they couldn't fix it they changed us to an equivalent room, all within 30 mins... on New Year's Day. You can also take a short drive to some of the outstanding beaches to the east (like Tamarindo). And the adjacent dry forest is definitely worth exploring - with the necessary precautions: the heat can be suffocating even in the early morning, some of the smaller trails are poorly marked, and you must keep an eye out for mountain bikers.

I do think people need to know that this is a place to relax and not a resort bustling with activities.

The bar by the back pool wasn't open at all when we were there, nor was the sunset cruise, nor the snorkeling...all of which was disappointing but we got over it. The front desk was very helpful. The spa was just okay, but again it's not a luxury resort. It has the potential to be incredible with a little attention to details.

The multiple kiddie pools, the super shallow side of the front pool with it's fountain, the shallow surf as well as the breakfast by the playground make for a very relaxing trip. This visit our kids were 7 and 11 so without those great benefits appealing to this age group we found the following shortcomings and standouts: Not much in the way of activities for kids that might like more independent. Though this was our 3rd trip they had no record of us and said we couldn't accrue our visits to the frequent visitor program. Our room, #301 was a handicapped room and the bathroom floor would soak after every shower. It also felt smaller than we remembered which may have been because the handicapped bathroom was larger and diminished the room size. In hind site we should have asked for another room. In the past with the meal plan, we received lunch and dinner on the day we arrived and breakfast and lunch on the day of departure. The policy has changed so for two nights stay we received only dinner on arrival day and breakfast on departure. 5 meals instead of 7.

The water is not at all inviting as it is covered in thick seaweed. We didn't see one person in the water on the hotels property. There is a public beach that is a short 5 minute walk. This beach was filled with locals and wasn't much cleaner. You need to watch your step as there is trash (bottle caps and such) around. I was very disappointed that the hotel did not clean up the beach area. The rooms are older yes, but they are very clean. Every staff member we met was extremely kind and professional. Anything we needed, like extra towels, iron even the microwave was brought to our room within minutes of requesting it. To make your \"family dollar\" stretch further, I would highly recommend you visit a grocery store before getting into the town of Guinica as there are no large grocery stores to be found, no decent restaurants as far as that goes too. There are small refrigerators in the room and like I mentioned, we requested a microwave too. You are at the mercy of the resorts 2 restaurants. One being very over-priced. The other option is eating at the open air bar. The setting there is very nice and enjoyable. Each night we were there, there was a live musician. The food was very good, although the kitchen staff seems to have problems following special instructions with certain dishes. Each time we ate there, they messed up at least one item. Our last meal was the worst, as my husband's appetizer order was never placed and the waitress delivered 2 of our 4 meals way before the others where prepared. Not to mention the french fry issue...but that's a long story~ Anyway, the manager was quick to respond and made our meal complimentary, which pleased us. There is a small gift shop where you can purchase soda/water and ice cream bars. Three ice cream bars set us back $8.00. There you can rent snorkeling gear and kayaks. My children and I did the \"snorkeling tour\". Which was a waste of good money. The coral reef which is just off the beach, was dead, the water way to choppy for snorkeling (even dangerous) and super cloudy. We saw just a few fish although, the captain takes you to where there a lot of large, live starfish. That was neat, but not at all worth the money. True snorkeling can happen at Culebra. If you have the opportunity to travel to the east side of the island, try that. Gilligan's Island is a very neat experience. We rented the snorkeling gear and took the little boat ride (which the hotel provides for a small fee). We were there on a weekday and there where roughly 40 locals. We choose to carry our cooler and gear over our heads and waded through the water to the other little island. There we felt as though we had the place to ourselves! There were hundreds of little fish that we could watch along the roots of the trees. We set up camp there and 3 hours went by way to fast. This is the second time I traveled to Puerto Rico. After experiencing the east coast, I wanted to see the south west coast. Even though I did enjoy my stay, I would recommend staying on the east coast. There are more restaurant options and more to \"do\". Pretty much anywhere you travel on the island, there are poor communities and narrow roads.

I wanted to do happy hour a couple of times but was discouraged by the atmosphere....it didnt seem welcoming and inviting. Even when we checked out we got no thanks for visiting us or have a good trip home...it was a strange vibe. I would love to go back as i came relaxed and the place has the potential to be really great! the rooms and beds were clean. We had some issues with our room....the phone did not work, tv had constant static, back door did not lock and our safe did not work. Some of things got fixed.....but it my mind. we are paying for a service and all this should be perfect. all in all we had a nice time...i hope for enthusiasm next time.

What we like: Beautiful setting, great climate (1 hour of rain in 11 days' total stay!), quiet and secluded, peaceful, great staff, unusually clean and well-kept property. What has improved: The (two) restaurants are both very good -- better than they were last year -- and the prices weren't out of line by our (Washington DC) standards. What could be better: Rooms are clean, spacious, well-kept and well-appointed, with comfortable beds, but not luxurious. What some may love and some may not like at all: Quiet, peaceful, beautiful ... and not much to do except lay around, on the (narrow) beach or at poolside. There is tennis (a very good pro, Efren Alfonso, is on call and his rates are great -- $45 a session), massage, a dinky exercise room, a boat excursion to a mangrove swamp (\"Gilligan's Island\"), and not much else. They bring in a guitarist several nights a week which is very pleasant, but otherwise it's not a place for nightlife. The resort is in a relatively isolated spot, about 2 1/2 hours' drive from San Juan. The nearby town (Guanica) is dead. The nearest towns of size are Ponce (about 45 minutes' drive) or Mayaguez (about an hour's drive). We are husband and wife, age 71 and 65 and in good shape, traveling with sister-in-law age 71 in not-quite-as-good shape. No kids traveling with us. It seems like a kid-friendly place, but it does not have organized activities for kids and didn't notice any lifeguards. You'd have to amuse the kids on your own. (Don't know if child care is available -- worth checking.) Still, we loved it last winter and, if anything, loved it even more this winter. It's a good bet we'll go back next winter too.

Super relaxing, beautifully situated, comfortable rooms, and well-managed with good service (unfortunately when you're traveling in PR on a budget that is not easy to come by). The staff and fellow travelers were very friendly. All the rooms seem to have a nice view. The hotel wasn't very busy while we were there; even though it has 100 rooms, the experience felt more intimate than that. It was by far the most family friendly place we stayed in PR. the casual restaurant is open air & has a playground in close proximity. Our 3 year old rarely has an interest in sitting at the table for more than 20 minutes, so he could safely run off to play at the playground where we could easily see him & we could finish our meal in peace. It was also the only place we stayed that had good salads in the restaurants, another item that's hard to find in PR. The babysitting services through the hotel are an absolute steal at $10/hour, take advantage! Seasoned caregiver Nicole took good care of our son, and we were able to rent a Hobie Cat for 1.5 hours & have fun by ourselves in Ballena Bay. Captain Roberto (Hobo) gave us a sailing refresher course for FREE (it had been over a decade for both of us), and sailed out with us in another Cat nearby for safety since the winds were about 20 knots. We tipped him generously. After drinks on the beach we enjoyed a nice dinner in the fancy restaurant while Nicole took care of our son. If you are interested in hiking, check out Bosque Seco, just north of the hotel. We parked near headquarters & did the Ballena trail downhill towards the beach with our stroller, a little rough but doable. Hubby had to hike back up to the car & drive back down to south trailhead to get us, however. By all means be sure to take the ferry to Gilligan's Island for a few hours. The water is crystal clear & it's like swimming in the Blue Lagoon. For swimming I would recommend a snorkel, mask & fins since the current comes in pretty strong from the ocean. For wading & splashing it's not necessary.

It's also such an easy flight from DC to PR, and we wanted a low-stress Honeymoon with little travel frustration. If you're looking for an isolated location, this is your spot! Getting there was a challenge, as it's located down a treacherous road along the coast (I was terrified - it was so curvy and narrow!) but once you get there it's totally worth the trek. We pulled the Honeymoon card when we got there (couldn't help it haha) and they quickly upgraded our room so we had a view of the ocean off the back patio, which was just lovely. We also happened to be there during the off-season (luckily avoided a hurricane) so there were very few other guests to compete with for beach chairs and service. The room was not very lush (and our toilet's pipes made weird whistling noises that ended up being a bit of a joke for us) but with how lovely the beach is, we spent most of our time outside anyway. The beach was wonderful - there are lots of fish swimming around right under the dock that are fun to watch while snorkeling. It's such an quick trip to Gilligan's Island where you can swim down these great channels and see a lot of beautiful underwater life - plus the Copamarina boat takes people back and forth all day long, so you don't HAVE to make an entire day of it. If you go a few kilometers down the road, there are very isolated beaches to explore - great caves and coral areas - it was just LOVELY! And if you just want to relax, there are beds on the beach for a nap and plenty of shaded areas to drift off under (even a few out in the water!) The service was wonderful - especially Robert (who wore many hats at the resort and kept looking out for us to make sure our stay was pleasant) and Jackie (who kept searching us out and made sure the drinks kept coming - and she was always super friendly). Service could have been a bit quicker at the bar and restaurant, but we were also struggling to get on \"island time.\" The knowledge of the dry forest nearby could have been better - we wanted to go hiking one day and asked at the front desk where to go, etc. etc. and were basically just handed a very generic pamphlet and sent on our way without much help. Every sign in and around the dry forest is in Spanish, so if you don't know the language, be prepared to kind of wing it. We went all-inclusive, which I think was totally worth it.

So we sat by the outdoor bar and watched the scores change on ESPN (along with 10 other people who wanted to watch the game), and then we decided to watch the Duke game in the business center. The Internet connection was also very slow using wireless and the landline. It couldn't even handle going into my email account much less a video feed.

They handed us our keys and left us to our own devices. We started walking, and walking and walking until we arrived at the very last row of rooms, almost falling over our suitcases from the terribly long walk. I couln't believe they did not offer us a ride in their convenient golf cart, we saw later during our stay. We had booked the week without dinners, so maybe we were placed on skid row without a ride. We also had an overlflowing toilet. The parking lot reeked of septic overflow. The pollution of the water in front of the inn is clealy apparent. There's not much life there. The beach next to the Inn was closed due to pollution also, proving this point. The service at the Inn was mediocre for us. Not sure how they treat their other guests, that book the more expensive rooms, but for the price we paid, service should have been exquisite. The staff was moping around and slow, or unresponsive when called upon, like when we called about the plugged up toiled. They waited until the next day, the whole thing overflowed, making us feel grossed out about our room. They did give us a free dinner for the inconvenience, which was nice and tasted great. Again, at their prices it's best to go to the Gilligan's Island next door where they serve very nice, fresh tasting dinner. Finally, getting to the inn is a sad experience with all the litter along the roads. Why does the Inn not see to it that it gets cleaned up. It is their calling card. A beautiful drive to the Inn makes for better expectations. Also, when they vacant rooms they don't turn off the aircondioning so the place sounds like a factory.

When we arrived in Guanica, we did not have directions. Both of our phones were out of battery. We stopped in Guanica, and in limited Spanish asked some towns people for directions. They drove us to the road we needed to take. It is just lovely. As we drove up the road, the view of the ocean was amazing. We parked in the lot. The hotel staff is very friendly. They give you their undivided attention. They do not move on to other concerns until all your questions are satisfied. Our room was spacious. The king size bed comfortable. The view amazing. It is a large complex. There are many families staying here. It can be a long walk to the restaurant if you have mobility issues. We did not mind the walk. There are many orchids growing in the trees. We enjoyed every minute of being outside. The beach is shallow and has sea grass. It is so clear though, that as you walk down to the end of the dock, you can see fish, starfish and the grass. The ocean is very warm here. We were able to take kayaks out to Gilligans island with Carlos on a Monday. We were able to snorkel there around the mangrove roots. It was just lovely. We also enjoyed eating at Las Palmas for breakfast and dinner. We enjoyed the guitar player that played each evening. They have a buffet at breakfast. They have three beautiful pools. They also have a kiddy pool. It is very family friendly. This part of the island is dry, and rarely rains. It is near a natural reserve called the DRY Forest. We were able to hike in the dry forest. We ate in town for breakfast several times at a bakery. We were able to learn some Spanish. The Puerto Ricans were very friendly when we attempted our limited Spanish. There is not much shopping. We actually originally only booked three days at this hotel. We did not have reservations for the rest of our trip. We drove north and visited Rincon and Isabella. After several days, we decided that the weather was best at the Copamarina. We called and they had a room. We headed back here and finished out our stay here. I really did not want to leave.

Free Wifi was included and laundry machines were available (both things I often miss at so-called five-star hotels.) The surrounding forest is exceptionally beautiful though there are no hiking trails reachable from the hotel without a car. The grounds are very nice but scheduled for further development to maximize room space and minimize the actual garden area. The pools were nice, though as all too common nowadays not nearly deep enough for any real swimming. The jacuzzis were OK, though one was not nearly hot enough. Now the downsides: 1. The hotel is very isolated. A car is a must. 2. PR-333, the road to the hotel, is very narrow, twisty, and scary. It is usually barely wide enough for two vehicles to pass each other with a few inches to spare. There are no sidewalks along the road, and bicycling would be far too dangerous. 3. Food options are somewhat repetitive over a longer stay. 4. The beach was polluted and closed due to excessive coliform bacteria count, or at least the public beach next door was. The hotel did not inform its guests of this problem. Raw sewage occasionally washed up onto the beach. 5. Like many hotels now it has upgraded to HDTVs without upgrading its satellite service which is still standard def and thus everyone on the TV looks extremely fat. 6. The maids routinely swept out the rooms onto the back porch and then left the back door unlocked, almost every single day. The staff knows this and even relies on this to get guests back into their rooms when the key cards stop working. 7. The hotel is excessively obnoxious about controlling your stay, not even allowing your guests to visit your room, the pool, or the beach. 8. The water sports were haphazard. The boat schedule was not reliable, and guests were not informed of the options nor were appointments kept. The Copa is undoubtedly the best hotel for miles around, and certainly the best nearest to Bosque del Seco.

The reservation area is open air and we could already tell we were going to like it! The room was very clean and well decorated, but the mattresses were a bit hard and lumpy. The ocean view from the room was wonderful and I really liked the two door set-up, but there was no key for the door leading to the beach. So, each time we went to the beach we had to walk out the door by the parking lot and walk around through the lobby in order to lock our beach side door. I think it would be really easy for them to key the doors the same so you could lock both doors with one key! However, that's my biggest complaint about the resort! Otherwise, it was absolutely wonderful. The beach is not white sandy beach, but it is nice, clean and we saw all kinds of star fish. There is sea grass, but the water is shallow very far out and you can see where you're walking. It wasn't a big deal. The dock was nice to walk out on and that's how we were able to see lots of star fish. We didn't take the trip to Gilligan's Island - too many people in a small area for us! Instead we took a day trip through the agricultural area to Joyudas for fresh sea food at Mao's (very good and nice, friendly people - locally owned), then headed south on Hwy 301 to Cabo Rojo! There is a light house and a secluded beach that was breathtaking. WE were there in March and it was us and about 25 other people - that was it! We hiked up to the light house for breathtaking views of 12 story cliffs and a beautiful sunset! I would highly recommend doing this. The country side is beautiful and the beach is worth the 30 mile drive.

There are not a whole lot of resorts down there, so Copamarina stood out, and we wanted to drive over the mountains, and to see the dry forest, so we booked a week. We did not choose the all-inclusive when we reserved, but when we got there we opted for it, since the nearby town does not have a lot of restaurant options, and we did not want to drive around after a few glasses of wine on unfamiliar roads. We are glad we did, because it let us really relax. No worrying about where to eat, when to leave, what to wear, and the food is very good at Copamarina. We do not usually lie around on vacation for too long, but this time we lounged. Of course we also enjoyed hiking in the dry forest reserve across the road (early, before it got too hot), and one day we drove to Ponce to see the old town. But the all-inclusive rate allowed us use of the 2 Hobie cats and sea kayaks, which was great. The coast is very pretty though the beaches are not endless strands here; there is sea grass and shallow water here, but you can walk to the end of the dock and swim comfortably from there, with the white sand bottom visible. People snorkeled at the reef offshore. There are not really any waves here, and there is a public beach walkable (right next door) with easier swimming. We enjoyed the dining room options. The all-inclusive gave you all you could hope to eat and drink. We ordered a pitcher of Sangria which was not only generous but lovingly crafted, and very strong... Three meals a day are served outdoors in the casual restaurant, and the white-tablecloth restaurant indoors is open for dinner. Rooms are spacious and have a balcony or terrace with table and chairs, and the beds are great. Service to the rooms was fine - very very clean - and the staff was always friendly.

The resort is on the southwestern coast of Puerto Rico, not an area familiar to most tourists. It is about a 2 hour drive from the airport in San Juan, and with the exception of making sure you find the correct exit to highway 52 out of San Juan, it is an easy drive. The resort has many positives and negatives and I will outline them below. But the important thing to remember about Copamarina, is that you are staying at a tropical resort for budget prices. I will start with the rooms. As best I can tell they range in price from approximately $155 to $285. With the exception of the beachfront rooms all are located in two story buildings, so each room has a balcony or patio. We stayed in a beach front room (which is the most expensive) and I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see a big difference between them and the garden view rooms (although some of the less expensive rooms are actually newer). All are just steps to the beach and pools, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not worth the small premium you pay for the upgraded room. The rooms themselves are fairly stark, with white painted walls, tiny bathrooms and old furniture. However, they are clean and given the rate you are paying this is what you would expect. The grounds at Copamarina are truly what distinguishes this hotel. There are two adults pools, two children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pools and two Jacuzzis. They are spread out over a large area which is meticulously maintained with beautiful walkways and gardens. The pictures from their website accurately reflect how beautiful the grounds are. As others have reported, the beach at Copamarina is not a turquoise tropical beach you might expect. The sand has a course brown texture and that gives the water the same brown appearance (similar to what you would see in the northeastern US). The sea grass is prevalent everywhere, you can swim in the water but you do end up swimming through the grass. There is a public beach next door to the hotel and there is no sea grass there. During our stay, I saw very few people sitting by the beach and no one was swimming, most guest preferred, as I did, to sit by the pools. The pools at the resort are beautiful, they are large with an abundance of comfortable chairs, tables and umbrellas. There is pool service and a bar nearby to each pool, so it is a great place to relax, much nicer than the beach. The food and service at Copamarina is solidly mediocre. Not bad, but absolutely nothing special. There are two restaurants at the hotel, the casual Las Palmas and the more expensive Alexandras. Las Palmas serves all meals and as I have said the food is ok but nothing special and the service is horrifically slow. I would strongly recommend a nearby restaurant for dinner, it is on the road right past Copamarina (actually overlooks the resort), they serve dinner outside on picnic tables and the food was really good. All told, I would recommend Copamarina if you are looking for a low cost escape from the winter cold, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind sitting by and swimming in the pool not the ocean and are ok with very simple rooms and mediocre meals. For most visitors from the US, San Juan is a direct flight, so Copamarina can be a quick getaway. Also if you live in the NYC area, you can fly directly into Ponce on Jet Blue, which is only 45 minutes from the hotel.", "Date": "February 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cCan't wait to go back\u201d", "Author": "mtb55", "ReviewID": "UR57027034", "Content": "I can't say enough about this hotel!

Rice and bean mixture and a salad...) at the resort - we were out on tour most of the time. But, prices are very expensive for meals and for drinks.

Beach is very pretty - there is some sea grass, but that didn't stop us from swimming out in it. One of our teens found a starfish, hermit crabs, and a live conch! Went kayaking one afternoon - tried to make it over to Gilligan's Island, but the wind was too strong. Still had a great time kayaking and they only charged us for 1/2 hr. Those in our group that took the ferry over to the island had a good time. Rooms were spacious and bed was comfortable. A couple members of our group had problems with ants in their rooms, but didn't let that bother them - after all, when in a tropical, Carribbean island, bugs happen!

Problems happen at all hotels, especially when they are located in remote locations (one of the Copamarina's great charms). But the Copamarina was quite impressive and extraordinary in their efforts to ensure the comforts of their guests. In a previous review, I mentioned that the food was overpriced and not that good. I am happy to report that the menu has improved considerably. The vegetarian options are both interesting and delicious, and the chief modified a fish dish to meet my dietary requirements. It was delicious. The food is not cheap, but it is now worth the price. Also, the wine list was varied and quite reasonably priced. The Copamarina is not for everyone. It is serene and secluded.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve read through the wide-ranging reviews for this property and thought I would add my perspective. My husband I just returned from a very enjoyable vacation in Puerto Rico, spending one night in Ponce, one night in San Juan, and three nights at the Copamarina at Gu\u00c3\u00a1nica. Our experience at the Copamarina was by far the best and was exactly what we were looking for, so I wanted to offer my insights. Background: We actually stayed at the Copamarina for several nights about 15 years ago, shortly after they opened. On our return visit, we were thrilled to see that the landscaping and grounds have matured nicely, and we felt that the newer buildings blended well with the original ones. We were particularly pleased with aspects of the property that attracted us in the first place: a secluded location, architecture and site orientation that blend well with the surroundings, NO casino or other glitzy tourist hype, and proximity to sites of historic, cultural, and natural interest. Now, some details. Yes, access to this property is via a narrow, winding road. However, in driving around PR over a period of days, we found that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty much the norm for road design, and the road to the Copamarina was in much better condition than other rural roads we encountered elsewhere on the island. We actually felt more comfortable driving on this road after dark, when the presence of car headlights made it clear when another car was approaching and all drivers had time to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153make way\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as needed. Yes, anyone staying at the property for more than a day or so would want to have their own vehicle (preferably something nimble and compact). The hotel is in a rather secluded location, so you would want to be able to drive to other attractions unless you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re really content to sit at one of the pools or the beach most of the time. We drove into Gu\u00c3\u00a1nica for dinner one night (for a very good seafood meal at the Blue Marlin) and also took day trips into the mountains (San German in particular is a charming place, well worth the drive). Yes, the beach at the hotel is small and has some seaweed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s part of the local ecosystem. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not a connoisseur of beaches, but I can easily imagine that larger, more spectacular beaches exist at other comparable property; however, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not what I was expecting, based on the descriptions and photos on the website. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t choose to go to Gilligan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Island, so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on the merits of that excursion. Yes, the hotel requires a $15 deposit on use of beach towels. I assume this is because the towels are pretty nice (large, fluffy, absorbent) and would have a habit of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disappearing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if the hotel didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t implement some deterrent for them ending us as souvenirs. We never had to wait for clean towels \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there were always at least a dozen of them stacked up in the gift shop. In generally, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel crowded anywhere at the resort (the pools, the bar/outdoor dining area, etc.). There were usually a lot of cars in the parking lot, but apparently the guests were spread out over a large area. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m puzzled by comments from reviewers who were convinced that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153locals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd were using amenities at the hotel. If by that you mean that a lot of other guests were from Puerto Rico (versus from the continental US or Europe), yes this property attracts many Puerto Rican citizens. I consider this to reflect very positively on the image and character of the property \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a gringo ghetto. As for townspeople coming onto the property to use the pool or other amenities, we never got that impression; most folks in Gu\u00c3\u00a1nica looked rather downtrodden, whereas the people we saw at the Copamarina were typically dressed in upscale vacation attire. As for food at the resort, yes, prices were higher than what we would pay back in the states. We never ate at the Alexander (because I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to eat indoors in such a lovely setting), but the meals we had at Las Palmas ranged from modest to very good in terms of quality and value. I read in our guidebook that Puerto Rico imports over 90 percent of its food. This is consistent with the fact that we saw very little fresh food on the island other than tropical fruit and seafood, and packaged/processed foods were distressingly prevalent in stores we visited. I think this accounts for the rather high prices and limited menu both at the Copamarina and other restaurants we visited (except in San Juan, which is a whole \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnother story \u00e2\u20ac\u201c much more cosmopolitan but also very pricy). We were disappointed to see packaged, pre-sliced white bread served at the Copamarina and elsewhere; if fresh whole-loaf bread is not available, I simply wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother to serve it at all. I do recommend the wonderful fresh fruit platter on the a la carte breakfast menu at Las Palmas. The breakfast buffet (offered one day during our visit) was heavy on processed cereals, packaged bread, powdered eggs, and so forth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any problems with service or staff at the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not sure what the complaints are about in this category. Yes, you can definitely run up a big tab at the bar if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a drinker, but those rum punches are GOOD. The Medalla Light beer served at the hotel was the only local beer we found anywhere on the island, and it is indeed very light; if you want more flavorful/exotic beers, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be limited to San Juan as far as we could tell. Our room was very comfortable and consistent with the website descriptions and photos. The bathroom was clean and spacious and the towels were of good quality. We LOVED the louvered windows and balcony area, which were well-designed for the climate. As a matter of personal preference, we avoid using air conditioning in all but the hottest of climates, so we had a good experience by turning off the AC (which was a bit noisy) and opening the windows at each end of the space, creating a nice cross breeze. There are ceiling fans on each balcony \u00e2\u20ac\u201c another one in each bedroom would be nice. Our room had a huge flat-screen TV, with a good selection of premium channels. Satellite reception wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comparable to what we have at home, but I imagine it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the best available for such a remote location. So, all in all, we had a relaxing, interesting vacation in a tranquil, attractive setting, at a fraction of the cost we might have spent at a high-end, franchise-driven operation elsewhere. We have traveled all over the world, in some cases to countries that were very poor, and we would rate this property very highly for its sensitivity to the local environment and its accessibility to the real character of the surrounding culture, with all of its assets and limitations.

Recommend that you ask for a renovated room if one is available because there is a difference. The pools are nice and clean and large enough for those who like to swim for exercise. It is a great place to stay and tour the Northwest and Southwest areas of PR. Recommend an SUV for traveling to some beach areas because the paved roads sometimes end and you travel through pot hole ridden dirt roads to park and walk to the beach. For instance, the scenery at the Cabo Rojo lighthouse and the adjacent, absolutely beautiful Playa Sucia (beach) can be difficult to get to in a car.

Rooms huge (and I've traveled a lot), spacious with a stunning view of the ocean. They have 2 good size pools. The beach is 5 ft from the pool. Beautiful, blue, calm ocean. Perfect for little ones. Fly in to either Ponce or Aguadilla Airports. The ride to the hotel is a lot shorter then flying into San Juan. The Event Planner at the Resort was on point. We working via email for months until 2 days I arrived before the wedding (By the way.. I was the wedding planner and sister of the bride). As soon as my husband and I got there Thursday afternoon they welcomed us with open arms. Our rooms were ready. We checked in and we were off to our room. The Event planner immediately heard I was checking in and came to introduce herself. She prepared the rest of the day to show me around the hotel. We had a king size bed, refrigerator, iron, safe, and hair dryer in our room. We even had breakfast table and sofa that sit 3 adults comfortably... with plenty of room to walk around and not trip over your luggage. Yup that's how big the rooms are. Not your typical standard hotel room. The wedding was October 10, 2009. 48 guests flew in from practically every where and arrived in Puerto Rico from different airports. The hotel had directions on their website which we sent all of the guests. Everyone rented their own cars and drove to the hotel. Everyone was so pleased with the directions. Considering the fact that we had some guests which never been to Puerto Rico before... driving can be a little tricky. NO ONE GOT LOST! Sorry I can't comment on the restaurants because I was too busy planning for the wedding. I did hear from the guests that the food was good...but wished it has more of the authentic food served in PR. Prices are reasonable! The day of the wedding. Ceremony was at 5pm (sunset). Cocktail hour and Reception was immediately following the ceremony. Couldn't ask for a better day. Everyone who was assigned to help out for the wedding was great. We changed the details of the reception several times and the staff was there working with us. We set up the room / centerpieces, decorations and it looked amazing. Just check out the pictures. The ceremony was absolutely breath taking. The food at the cocktail hour and reception was really good. (no I'm serious) It was really, really good. My sister picked appetizer / salad and for the main course Filet Mignon and Lobster tail. The best man also surprised the groom with a Cigar Roller. I think I'm saying that right. Well he hired a person which rolls fresh cigars and it was which was a huge hit. The wedding was the event of the year. Everyone had so much fun.

My boyfriend and I booked this resort for a 3 day 2 night start of our PR tour. We were very excited as we read that it was rated as a very romantic place for couples and that it was surrounded by a natural dry forest. Well to put it simple, if you do not have a rental car you will be completely STUCK in this resot. There is only ONE road into this resort and it is very windy and cuts through the side of a small mountain. So, if you do have a rental car, be brave enough to treck through the road during the day nevertheless at night when you're trying to get some snacks or looking for entertainment....with NO road lights. If you would like anything beside a soda past 8pm, you're out of luck. Of course you can still go to the bar and spend lots of money for one drink or spend lots of money at the only restuaurant with ok food. If you have kids or if you're like me and wanted some chips at around 9:45, you have to be brave enough to drive through that one road to get to town. The beach looks beautiful...and the set up is so calm and relaxing. What you don't see is that the water never really comes up on their beach and even if it were to, the floor is covered with ocean plants so it would feel weird to walk on it. Their solution ....pay $7 and take a small boat ride to Guilligan's Island. This is a must and honestly the only way you're going to get in some decent natural water. In all, there were many many locals there. They simply just came by in the afternoon and would use the facility as there was no true security in the front.

The property is very well maintained and is absolutely beautiful. I frequent Copamarina when I have guests from Washington, D.C. area on the way to Guilligans Island. We stop there for lunch. My personal experiences now include all three meals. I have to say that the meals that I've eaten have all been exceptional. For some, the price could be considered to be on the high side. But I don't mind paying for quality food and service. Besides, the food is fresh and the recipes are outstanding. The room that I stayed in has not been renovated yet. It was very comfortable and clean. My only recommendation is that the manager consider putting a new mattress that room while waiting for renovation. Either the mattress was aging, or I just like a firmer mattress. My visit was very pleasant, in large part because of the staff. Everyone including reservations, housekeeping and restaurant staff were very pleasant and accommodating. This property, in my opinion, is really geared to clients who enjoy peace and tranquility. There is no casino or wild evening party music. Rather, a guitarist plays beautiful background music at the outdoor restaurant/bar in the evening, which is relaxing and enjoyable. The hotel beach is great for small children, but Guilligans is much better, and only a short boat ride away. Although the hotel provides shuttle service, there is also a private dock just a couple of minutes away that provides service. That service is private owned, and they offer a lunch menu that they will deliver to Guilligans. Although convenient, quality is lacking as far as I'm concerned. You are better off grilling out or taking a packed lunch. I'm taking a friend to the hotel restaurant tonight for a nice evening out. It's about a 40 minute drive from my retirement home in Boqueron. Have been here for one year, and have found the hotel restaurant to be among the best in the Southwest side of the island. It is fine dining without being forced to wear special evening attire. Casual attire for dining, on this side of the island is the norm.

After a deployment to Iraq my wonderful husband thought it would be relaxing to take me to Puerto Rico. The Copamarina scenery is very beautiful but definitely should not be considered luxury. The staff is nice nice but lacks the customer service skills necessary to work a real \"luxury\"hotel. The rooms are small and outdated. They should not charge as much as they do. You can stay at a luxury Marriot for less and get way more for your money. The Copamarina does not have luxory amenities nor do you feel that you are in a resort. The service at both restaraunts is extremely slow and the staff could care less that you have been standing at the bar waiting to order a drink. They just simply continue with their conversation or the hard task of slowly making 1 drink at a time at the slowest pace possible. No sense of any type of urgency to utilize any type of bartending skills necessary to work a \"resort \" bar. We waited over 20 min to get our coffee after we finished our dessert last night. We had ordered our coffee at the same time as our dessert thinking they would come out together. Our waitress though nice was completely oblivious to the fact that we arrived at 7:30pm and left at 10pm due to slow service. Nor did she offer an apology for the long wait for our coffee. You would think that when you see customers falling asleep at the table because they had been waiting sooo long that a staff member would have checked on them but noooo they also were oblivious to us. Maybe because my family has the unique ability to suddenly turn invisible to avoid waiters and waitresses to wait on us. After reading the other reviews and seeing the responses from the \"manager\" i would have to say that he is completely delusional if he thinks that his \"resort\" is up to standard or can even be compared to other luxury resorts. He is in complete denial. He needs to open his eyes and really see what is in front of him. He does not seem to really be listening to what the customers are saying instead only hearing what he wants to hear. He needs a reality check and to actually listen to what people are saying about his \"resort\" and make the necessary adjustments. He seems to actually blame the customers for their bad experiences at HIS \"resort\". Unbelievable. I have stayed at luxory resorts before and have NEVER and I say NEVER had to leave a deposit for a pool towel. The staff should be more well versed in what service they provide as they all seem to look clueless when asked about \"things to do\" at their \"resort\". Also, at a luxury resort there is usually a concierge to help with activity arrangements and a $235.00 room looks like $235.00 room and actually has an iron to iron your clothes. And the \"adult\" pool that is filled with small probably pool peeing children is extremely small for a \"resort\". AND yes, I realize that they have 2 pools and 2 kiddie pools. the other pool is only 3-4 ft deep. AND at luxury resort there is ROOM SERVICE! AND furthermore the beach is not really a beach where you can swim. There are no waves and it is full of yucky grass or seaweed which the manager has stated is part of an ecosytem....blah, blah, blah. The small beach down the strip is rather nice and relaxing though.

Our credit card company contacted us about the charge due to suspicion regarding fraudulent activity.

They had a huge foozball machine in the gameroom that we really wanted to play but was informed by the front desk that it hadn't been working for months. All in all would not recommend this place.

We were happy with the new flat screen television in our room...the beds were comfy too unlike what some of the other reviewers wrote....the mattresses felt new as well.....our room, room 105, has a big patch of dirt where the grass had not grown outside our patio area and it made for a very messy patio and room which was a pain...that whole immediate patch of rooms are that way...102, 103, 104, 105, 106.....not good rooms to stay in patio- wise....we had that room assigned to us a few years ago and I had switched the room because of that problem but this time as soon as we checked in I unpacked our luggage and toiletries and had forgotten about that's room patio area so it was too late for me to ask for a change of room since I didn't want to haul all our stuff out of the drawers again, etc......they really need to put grass down there or even make it a cement extension or something because we had Housekeeping very busy with cleaning that patio...lots of extra work for them and a nuisance for us.... Our stay was different than other times because we've gone in years past during non-holiday, non-peak times so in years past, if the resort was crowded, it was crowded with people from the States such as ourselves or Europeans and it always felt peaceful. This time schools on the island were closed early for Holy Week, Good Friday, and the resort got jam packed with locals. The room next to ours was occupied by a couple and their two kids and they were really rowdy and loud...at around 11:45pm one night I was awoken by the sound of the lounge chairs and the table from the patio next to our room being dragged and thrown around...when I got up, opened the patio door and looked next door, the woman who had checked in had a garbage can full of soapy water and was throwing it on the tiles on the patio and moving the furniture around to get the water under the furniture...at first I asked her in English what she was doing and she didn't understand me so I proceeded to ask her in Spanish what she was doing and why the noise and she told me that housekeeping hadn't cleaned her patio so she was cleaning it...at midnight? Of course I didn't believe it and she saw I was upset so she stopped making all the racket and I went back to sleep. The next morning when I opened the patio door to sit outside there was a horrible smell of vomit!! Now I understood why she was cleaning the patio floor!!! Her husband and friends had gotten back to the room drunk and who knows what happened on that patio!!! Anyway, I called housekeeping who came right away and cleaned my patio and sprayed some special stuff to get rid of the horrible odor. (The housekeeping staff was great to us!) The owner of the resort came by and asked me to write a note about what had happened the night before, etc, so he has it on record since who knows if those crazy guests would wind up eventually destroying the room...apparently according to some employees at the resort, the crazy neighbor guests brought an electric stove into the room and were cooking on it which is a fire hazard and illegal!!!! Supposedly they had used bath towels to clean off the grease from the cooking, etc...anyway, I was told the owner of the resort told them to get all that out of the room and they did...That same morning those same crazy guests, hosted about 25 of their closest family and friends, who were not staying at the Copamarina by the way, but who had arrived with about six coolers full of booze and food...they were smoking right next to my room, cussing, speaking about sex, and everything else, right in front of us and my six year old son. My husband went to the front desk to complain and the Manager told him they can't control who comes into the resort since it's Good Friday and the guests invite their friends to come and stay for the day so after my husband complaining and voicing that it was not fair that our day has to be ruined by these people, the Manager, very reluctantly, gave my husband $80 off that night's rate and four free drink coupons...she had offered him two drink coupons at first and when my husband looked at her like \"seriously?\" she gave him two more.... I would have much rather they get rid of the low lifes that were invading our space and not allowing us to enjoy our room or patio for the entire day rather than getting the discount, but what were we going to do? If Management allows it......We are regulars there and are considered \"VIP's\"....we didn't feel like it. We left the resort for the day and just drove around the island...a wasted day and money that we could have spent at the resort...but it was really unbearable....we came back to the resort that night and low and behold the nuts were all there in full force boozing and yelling up a storm in the patio next to ours....another problem the resort had, and which I had complained to the front desk asking for the Manager about, but the Manager was too busy to come out and talk to me, was the beach next door to the resort was also packed with locals and on a few instances the locals walked along the beach onto the resort grounds and used the facilities....I was worried about this since some of us leave things along the beach and poolside that are valuable, like cameras, and these locals can come onto the property, swipe the stuff, and just walk back to their beach...anyway, although the Manager was too busy to come out and talk to me, in fairness she (or perhaps the owner?) did put a security guard at the part of the beach that entered the resort grounds as to deter the non-Copamarina guests from crashing the property again...so I didn't see any of that the rest of the stay...that was indeed rectified.... Bottom line, we will never go back to the Copamarina during any kind of holiday because there are alot of undesirable locals that stay there.... another person staying at the resort, a local himself, told us that the reason people that nasty can afford to stay at the resort is that they probably charged every one of their family members that came to spend the day at the resort with them money so they can pay for the nightly fee...so if they had 25 of their friends and family come to enjoy the pool, beach and facilities with them for the day, they charge them $20 each...amazing! Who knows too if the resort charges the locals less money because they live on the island...something like Disney, you know? Live in Florida and get into the parks at a discounted rate?....who knows....another employee told us he had never in the years he's worked there, seen it so full...he said the capacity was 260 and they were at 290....There was not even a parking spot in the lot which we've never seen before and we were told to park in Employee parking which was very inconvenient....also, not a beach or pool lounge chair was available...by the time we got up and out of our room at 8am or so we were out of luck with finding a good spot anywhere to lay and relax... In fairness, except for the last couple of days of our stay where all this happened, the other four days of our stay were nice... it could have been better by the whole stay being as it always was when we've visited in years past though...also, we didn't see alot of the old faces, employees, we've seen in years past which saddened us...it made us feel like family coming back and seeing the same faces year after year....They either quit or were let go....possibly because of the economy? Luis, the chef, was still there and he is fabulous!!! We love him and he's seen our son literally grow up since we've taken our son to the Copamarina every year since he was about two months old.... :) We're hoping to continue going to Copamarina every year as we always have but right now we are a little disappointed so we'll see...", "Date": "April 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Albany, NY", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful setting, good food, friendly people made for a nice stay\u201d", "Author": "PFT3", "ReviewID": "UR26625716", "Content": "We found this resort to offer a very nice and relaxing experience.

Copamarina doesn't pretend to be a lively place. It's quiet, you are left alone but helped if you need it. The other guests were spread out and the beach was nicely arranged with chairs, tables, loungers and cabanas. The water at the beach isn't deep (you can walk out quite a ways and still have it only be to your waist but I loved this. I could sit in the water and just relax. Little kids could play without parents having to worry. The surf is calm as it's in a protected bay so you can pull your chair right into the water if you like. The rooms were comfortable and I definitely felt it was worth it to get the deluxe ocean front room. We had the best location right on the ground level to all the resort had to offer. Other rooms may have an ocean view, but there is a portion of the property enclosed by a fence at the beach--to denote privacy--and we were glad we had an unobstructed view. The fitness room was clean, cool and well equipped. They also have a water bubbler in there which was a nice treat to fill up my water bottle with cold water. The pools were quiet and serene, and I loved dipping in the hot tub at night. We also really liked the location. It was quiet and away from the tourist traps you might find in other sections of the island. Plus, they only get 15 inches of rain per year so even though Ponce might get a sprinkle of rain, Copamarina was sitting in the sun. San German is an easy half hour drive and well worth the trip to a quaint town with great places to eat on the square. Ponce, Lajas and La Paguera were all an easy 20 minute drive. Further down on 333 from the resort is a very large, nice beach with walking trails. We went in the afternoon before sunset and there seemed to be next to no one there--I'd spend the day here before going to the public beach. The only negative things I have to say about the place were that the bedding could use some updating and the restaurants were nothing special. The comforters were a bit haggard, not too bad but certainly not luxury. And, the beds weren't the most comfortable. I still slept fine, but this would be an amazing place if the beds could be upgraded. The restaurants are convenient but in my opinion are over priced for okay food--especially the drinks. I recommend going to the Econo in town to pick up drinks, snacks and breakfast items, eating lunch at the resort (they had more selection and it these meals were delicious) and then getting dressed up to go out of the resort for dinner. There really are several choices either in Guanica, Lajas, Ponce or San German. Look for the Tapas Bar in the square in San German--amazing food and SO cheap! Three people ate and drank for $50! The resort has a dive shop that offers trips and from what I can tell the best thing might be to take out the kayaks and visit Gilligans Island on your own. We took the shuttle boat and realized that we could have easily kayaked ourselves over. Once you're over there, you're stuck until you get picked up and though you can snorkel, , there isn't much to see right near the island. I would have liked the ability to explore a bit more and will do this the next time I visit. Also, I wish I would have known ahead of time but Gilligan's Island actually has a bathroom facility, picnic tables in spots with cookout areas. It would have been nice to come prepared to bbq. Go early to get a secluded spot. We enjoyed sitting at on the beach or by the pool and at night we relaxed while listening to the live mellow music and overall had a wonderful stay. I would definitely go back to Copamarina.", "Date": "February 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "brooklyn", "Title": "\u201cwhen it's good it's very good, but when it's bad it's horrible...\u201d", "Author": "joandaveyg", "ReviewID": "UR24866818", "Content": "Vacationed at the Copamarina in January '07 with my daughter. had a lovely time. Landscape is beautiful, food is more than adequate and the beach is both pretty and swimmable. Liked it so much I returned with my husband the following February. Unfortunately, this trip was a total disaster. On our first day, after a swim in one of the pools, we went back to our room and naturally wet the floor with our dripping suits. The floors are marble and when I removed my flip flops I took a flop and broke and dislocated my arm. While this probably could have happened at any resort what ensued could only happen at a place that puts absolutely no emphasis on customer service or safety. It was already dark and we asked the desk person for an ice pack and ace bandage. Sorry, no ace bandages and no ice, yes your heard that right, no ice! Could someone help us get to the nearest hospital or clinic? No they could not. Upon our repeated requests, really more like begging, since the roads are so dark and winding, they found someone who would be passing the clinic on their way home and that we could follow, but would have to find our own way back. Well, we didn't have a better offer so took them up on that one. After a very painful and difficult evening we returned to The Copamarina where my husband, with absolutely no assistance from any hotel staff, spent the evening trying to arrange for a trip home the following morning, which we were able to do, at great expense to us. We paid for our nights lodging and two meals which we had. No one from the resort ever contacted us to find out how I was. After several months, when I was on the mend, I called to express my disappointment with the way in which they handled our situation. The new general manager, explaining that the previous manager was no longer employed and his poor record was part of the reason, apologized profusely and asked that we please consider returning as guests of the resort and to please contact him to make the arrangements. This month we decided to contact the resort and return. Not only was the manager that we had corresponded with not there, but we were given the run around for 2 weeks via email. Finally we were given an offer to return that was just slightly better than what was available on priceline. At no point did the management make us feel that they were anxious to compensate us, but rather that we were just looking for a bargain. In any case we have decided not to return since we were certainly not seeking a bargain, but rather what had been promised and we felt deserved by us.

Our favorite thing about the place is the people who work there. The weather is outstanding too....always 85 and sunny during the day and like a warm summer evening every night. We always rent a car and drive over from San Juan. The signs are in Spanish, but the MPH are American, with the distances in metric. It's a 2 hour drive, and easily done by taking the Tedoro Moscoso Bridge (the one with all the flags on it) to Rt. 17. Stay in the right lane and take the Caguas exit to Rt. 52 south. This will take you over the mountains (with a few tolls along the way...less than $5 total). In Ponce, Rt. 52 converts to Rt. 2. On Rt. 2 just past Yauco, take exit #194 to Rt. 116. At the 3rd traffic light, take a left (by the Burger King) onto Rt. 333. Watch your speed in the school zone and beware of stray dogs, then wind your way along the coast (yes, it's a narrow road!) past the beautiful cliffs and scenery. Copamarina is about 3-4 miles on the right, just past the Cana Gorda public beach. It is true that there isn't a whole lot to do, compared to other resorts in big cities. Guanica is a small town, but it sits right in that Dry Forest area, which gives it much less humidity and rain than say San Juan. We love to hike in the Dry Forest. There are trails off of Rt. 334 in the hills where you can see lots of birds, including the adorable Puerto Rican Tody. This curious little hummingbird-sized bird will actually come out to check you out as you walk the trail! On the Meseta Trail at the end of Rt. 333 (turn right out of the hotel and continue a few miles to the end of the road) is gorgeous....you walk right along the coast, where you'll see birds you've never seen before, plus a lot of Kestrels! Get there early however, because it gets HOT! Also, that is a hotspot for male prostitution, but we've never encountered any problems when we hike there every morning. The hotel itself has beautiful grounds. Lots of pretty plants and blooming bushes and trees. A lot of them are labeled. They are constantly raking and trimming. The pools are nice and well cared for. The beach is somewhat small and does have seagrass, but they are good about raking up anything that gets in the sand. Beyond the sand, in the water, is more like silt - where the seagrass grows. It's not a swimming beach! We've never gone to Gilligan's Island, but it's a cheap ferry ride for those interested. The rooms have barely changed in the four years we've gone there. They could use some updating. Our room, 210, did have a brand new BIG flat screen TV which was appreciated! They don't have the major ABC, NBC, etc. networks however. They have ESPN and CNN, plus a few HBO channels and others...maybe about 24 in total? The new dresser under the TV is nice to not only put clothes in, but there's lots of room on top of it for clothes or whatever. There are no elevators to the 2nd floor, but you can get assistance from the bellman to get your bags to your room. We stayed in room 410 our first night before being moved to our favorite room, and the TV had not been updated yet. Also, that bed was a bit saggy in the middle and not comfortable. The bed in 210 was great however. Re: the views, the best views in our opinion, are in the 200 building on the 2nd floor. The bathroom needs better lighting. Also, there are no bathtubs in the 100, 200 or 300 buildings, in case that matters to you. We let them know on earlier visits that they could use more hooks in the bathroom, and lo and behold, they added some! The shower has good water pressure, but once in a while the temp fluctuates, which is typical in the Carribbean. The bath products supplied are good quality, although the mint fragrance is not our favorite. The maids do a good job getting in and making up the rooms while you're out. Sometimes they had already finished by the time we returned from breakfast! We skipped the all-inclusive deal, and figured that we'd have spent an extra $240 or so a day if we had gone that route, so anything we spent that was less than that was saved! This allowed us to not be gluttons! That way too, we could afford to tip the servers well for their excellent service, and still save $$. They recently got a very good new chef for the Alexandra restaurant, Fernando. He and another chef, Eric, plus the ones at Las Palmas do a nice job of cooking local flavors plus good old American type cooking (be careful though if you don't like garlic!). The burger and carrot cake at Las Palmas are SO good! We also love the omelets prepared by Luis, and the banana/walnut pancakes for breakfast. We were surprised to see the iced tea & lemonade glasses have been downsized and the price increased. The prices for beer and drinks are definitely up there. If you venture off the resort, you'll find much more reasonable prices. We love the outdoor dining though and the view of the water, boats, sunsets, etc., and the fact that we don't have to drive....we just walk right back to our rooms. Tito does an excellent job playing the guitar! He knows MANY different genres, so don't be afraid to request something! The bartenders are a lot of fun.....Raul, Carlos, Jaime. The servers can really make your trip a good one. Some of them have become like family to us. Kudos to Ramon, Madi, Valerie, Sullybeth, Jessenia, Wanda, Brandomar, Dalimar, Love, Nelson, and their manager Wilfredo, took very good care of us. Don't be afraid to venture out. We've visited Cabo Rojo, La Paguera, Ponce, and some of the west coast beaches. The signs are in Spanish, but if you just follow the names of the towns you want, you should be okay. Seems like everyone speaks at least a little English. All this being said, we still love Copmarina but it is not cheap to stay here.

Some fun things to do outside of the resort: snorkel around Gilligan's island, eat at Rivera Panaderia in Guanica, (if you're used to city life, this place will look like a dump from the outside, but the SANDWICHES, YUM!!!!), go walk around the dry forest--on the way, look for a handwritten sign on someone's fence that says, \"Se vende limber.' Limber is kinda like a Puerto Rican version of sorbetto. It's almost always sold out of someone's house and costs about $1 or less per serving. Just as you're coming into town from the resort, there is a little bar/shack on the left side of the road that sells coco frio--that's coconut milk right out of a coconut drilled right in front of you, (look for the coconuts on top of an ice machine). Other people's reviews are only partially correct when they say that there is nothing to do in Guanica outside of the resort--especially on Mondays and Tuesdays. However, the best thing about Guanica that is available everyday is its people. Try making your Puerto Rican vacation like a Rick Steve's Through the Back Door book and get to know the people and lifestyles of Guanica. One more thing...right off the highway on the way to Copamarina is a trailer where some locals sell pretty decent pizza. Try it! You know you'd never do it in the states because it would be disgusting. In Guanica, it's part of the local culture.

The parrots did not make any noises that would disturb guests. Matter of fact, they were much quieter than the guests. I would have liked to see the parrots have more activities in their cages because some looked bored and some looked like they were in too small of cages and like they existed solely for their beauty and not their comfort. The room I stayed in was nice. It was on the ground floor of a two story building. There was a nice door that opened to the gardens with tropical flowers that I enjoyed. The garden door had a top and a bottom that can be opened in two different pieces for a nice ocean breeze if you choose. The decor was nice too. It was not top of the line, but in good condition, tropical and pretty. The bathroom had a few small rogue ants on the counter that most likely came in through an open window near the ceiling. I really dislike bugs, but the ants did not bother me at all and I was able to quickly get rid of them and I don't remember them coming back after that. There was a fantastic ocean view from the room when the garden door was open. The grounds were well maintained. The housekeeping staff did a nice job at maintaining the room during my stay and the public areas were kept clean too. The cleaning staff mops the terra cotta tile in the common area outside the front of the room early in the morning so be careful, I slipped and fell on the wet floor, but was ok so just laughed it off. I needed to use the laundry machine and I don't recomend it for delicate garments because it ripped an item, but overall no biggie - I didn't have a garmet bag for the wash as I would at home. The beach was amazing and I did many watersports. I took an aqua cycle, kayak and a water scooter and had a great time. I didn't think these were included in the price of my stay since I didn't go all-inclusive, but didn't get charged extra for these when I checked out. There were great lounge chairs sunk partially into the ocean that were so memorable to me. It was such a greta experience to be lounging in the late afternoon sun and have gentle waves washing up on the seat of the lounger to cool me down. The water was so blue and was never rough surf. The restaurant was tasty. Breakfast had a variety of hot and cold items and was included because I booked using the \"Puerto Rico Is Fun package\". I don't know if the country's tourism department still promotes tourism with this package. I did dinner at least one night and remember having a tender fillet with baked plantain chips garnished with caribbean fruits-yum! If you are looking for a relaxing vacation or a vacation where you can be in touch with nature in the ocean or at the dry forest nearby than this is for you. I am not a surfer, but nearby in Rincon there is great surfing and beaches, although becoming increasingly popular since my stay. If you would like to leave the resort to explore I recomend a car rental since you are in a secluded area of the island. There was also a bioluminescent bay in Llajas where you can take a boatride to see. It was threatened by boat pollution 6 years ago so I don;t know if you can still see it. Llajas is a very small town with friendly people. If you are not comfortable with this type of environment than the boatride might not be for you. I didn't want to leave and tried to extend my stay on the day I checked out, but the resort was booked solid. Locals sometimes come to stay at the resort to enjoy themselves because it is so beautiful and offers many fun amenities.", "Date": "September 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Juncos PR", "Title": "\u201cgreat place to stay.\u201d", "Author": "ManoloJuncosPR", "ReviewID": "UR20474637", "Content": "been there at least twice a year since 2005 an every time it gets better and better!!!!

First, the staff was great and upgraded us without asking to a suite at the end of a building so it had views on 3 sides. The room was great with nice if a bit cheap furniture, comfortable bed, sitting area, etc. The resort grounds are very nice with typical tropical resort landscaping and a nice newer pool at one end. The restaurant and bar are also quite nice. The resort is well patronized by Puerto Ricans as we were possibly the only gringos there at the time but we still felt very welcome. Now for the negative part: the beach is not conducive to laying out or swimming. It is a very \"biologically-active\" beach so we're talking muck that smells like raw sewage making it rather unpleasant to try to lay out within 30 feet of it let alone swim near shore. The owners claim it is a bioreserve and so the intact sea grass beds create this situation. That is fine but it is not a pleasant beach atmosphere. The \"swimming\" beach a short walk away is a public park beach that we found littered with garbage and excrement and it has an extremely steep profile so waves break right on it making it unsuitable for swimming especially for children. The cove however is really nice and we rented a hobie cat and had a great sail. While we were there a sunken boat was blocking the way to Giligan's Island so we could not get there, perhaps that has been cleared by now.

Not comfortable at all. The A/C unit did not work properly, it was barely 75 degrees in the room. The TV did not have a good reception. I informed the front desk of these problems and none were corrected. I was offered another room, however when I checked the other room the A/C had the same problem, and the room wasn't any better. The beach was horrible! A public beach is a few hundred yards away and the swimming there is awesome, the water is clean. Yet, at the Copamarina the water and sand is disgusting. The resort nickles and dimes you for everything, even a short trip to a nearby island. (The Conquistador in Fajordo has a private island and they don't charge you to take you there). When you go check out the beach towels you are immediatley told that there is a $15.00 dollar fee per towel if you don't return them. If you want to take a kayak there is a fee. There is nothing for free!!! And the resort charges too much to stay there!. The restaurant, The Alexandra, is rated five stars. However, when we ate there the food was horrible. My sister-in-law and my husband ordered the same dish, the shrimps were hard. My sister-in-law's husband ordered a New York Strip and was brought another type of meat that was hard and dry. The food took forever to reach the table. While we made reservations for 8:30pm, ordered crab cakes (which were horrible), it an hour to get our food. And the restuarant was not full. The waitress was less than pleasing. In addition, when I got my credit card bill the Copamarina charged me additonal for unknown reason, which I am disputing. I would not recommed this hotel to anyone. If you can't find somthing in Ponce keep going. Save your money.

Hopefully this review will be helpful. I'll start with the good: 1)The grounds are emmaculate - reminded me of Hawaii. These grounds are definitely the pride and joy of the owner. 2) Alexanders was wonderful dining. However fast service does not exist - expect your dinner there to last at least 2 hours. 3) The dive shop was very helpful. We went to Gilligan's island on a ferry and we snorkeled on a sand key off shore from the Copamarina. Both fun excursions that we booked through the dive shop. 4) The wait staff and bar tenders were all delightful. very attentive even when busy. Try the Mojita's--the best I've ever had! Now the bad: 1)Housekeeping in the rooms was minimal. The bathroom floor and shower walls had many hairs and other ick on it from previous guests. I finally just wiped the walls down myself. 2)Our toilet overflowed all over one afternoon. I called the front desk and requested engineering followed by housekeeping. We then left and returned to our room in the evening. Engineering had come and fixed the toilet. They also used all of our towels to mop up the floor, leaving them in a heap in the middle of the bathroom. I called the front desk to enquire about housekeeping. I was told housekeeping was told to come and now they were gone for the night so nothing more could be done. I asked for new towels so I could line the dirty floor with clean towels. I was told that only housekeeping had a key to the lilinen room and again they were gone. After much insisting the evening manager finally agreed to get clean towles out of an empty room if I would come pick them up. When I picked up the towels he also gave me a bottle of disinfectant so I could clean the floor myself!! I spoke with the main manager the next day and was given an apology and that was it. 3)Two in our party got food poisoning from the outdoor restaraunt. 4)The beach is pretty at high tide but not very nice to walk or play in. It basically was made of areas of clay and sea grass. Luckily the island is full of many other beautiful beaches. Would I go back to the Copamarina?? Definitely not. Would I go back to Puerto Rico?

We had read all the reviews and it is funny how there are such conflicting opinions. In general we agreed that the resort is a beautiful setting, but the food leaves much to be desired. One of our main complaints was that even though the resort was almost empty, we were assigned to a room right by the noisy ice machines and maid closet, plus we were directly adjacent (with a shared connecting door) to a large group of young people who obvioulsy went out partying each night (not at the resort) until 3:00am and came home very boisterous. The walls are very thin, so it felt like they were in our room. It made no senss to us that we were not 'spread out'. After the 2nd night, we asked to be moved, and we were accommodated immediately, with no questions asked (we should have asked earlier). Back to the food, we don't consider ourselves food snobs by any means, but we rated the resturants as mediocre. Also, the first night at Alexandra's, we mentioned casually to the matre'd that we had not yet been visited by the waiter, after about 10-15 minutes (we just wanted to place a drink order since it was so nice sitting outside by the pool). Th waiter then showed up, obviously perturbed at our impatience, and rudely asked what we wanted to order, since he assumed we were in a hurry. We explained that we were not in a hurry, just wanted a drink. By the end of the evening we were on chummy terms with him, so it turned out OK. The drive from San Juan took longer than expected, but it is very scenic, and that was the only 'sightseeing' that we did, since we generally did not want to leave the resort, since it is so pleasant and restful. We did the Gilligan's Island trip - definetly over-rated, I'm sad to say. It is very small and very few areas to sit on the beach. We found the service at the resort to be very good, with everyone very friendly (we opted for the all-inclusive plan, so we got to know the wait staff well by the end of our stay). Not sure if the all-inclusive is worth it - you have to eat/drink a lot to justify it. Plus, tips are not included, which adds to the overall cost and makes it harder to justify.

Just before Ponce we detoured to Tibes to see the very interesting native museum and reconstructed village. The guide was very knowledgeable. It's a challenge to find with few road signs but it's worth the effort and a visit. The resort is down a very narrow, twisty, hilly road. Once you finally get to the hotel the grounds are beautiful with manicured lawns and lots of flowers and Palm trees. The parking lot was full but the resort never felt crowded. There was enough room for everyone to spread out and find a quiet spot. The many beautiful pictures people have posted of the grounds are accurate. On the other hand, there are few pictures posted of the rooms which tend to be dark, small and rustic. We had an ocean front room in building three on the second floor with a balcony. Being an old resort the walls are not very thick so it's possible to hear conversations in the rooms on either side of you. There are vent windows over the shower in the bathroom that open onto the walkway and people should know their conversations in the bathroom can be heard by people passing by. Since we were on the second floor we didn't hear anyone walking above us but that might be a problem in the first floor rooms. The bathroom had obviously recently been renovated and was nicer than the one we had in San Juan with a big tiled shower. The room furniture could stand an updating. And as someone previously said the pillows were small, foam and not very comfortable. We used a back cushion from the chair as a pillow and that worked better. The balcony fan didn't work and two requests to have it fixed were ignored. The balcony furniture was stained and the privacy dividers were lattice so they gave little privacy. However, the view from the balcony was lovely. We ate dinner both nights at the Alexandra Restaurant. Usually we'd go off site after the first night but the resort is fairly isolated and the thought of driving the twisty road in the dark to return to the resort after dinner discouraged us. On the other hand, we had excellent meals both nights at the Alexandra. We ate one of the chef's seafood specials each night and each was delicious. They were of equal or better quality to the dinners we had in San Juan and of comparable cost. The buffet breakfast at Las Palmas was good with a cook making omelots and waffles but at $16 per person it was expensive for what each of us was able to eat. The pools were clean and beautiful and it was great that there were two adult pools, two kids pools, two whirlpools, as well as the beach. The water in the pools and at the beach was very warm which I really liked. The beach was very shallow which was fine for me but swimmers walked to the end of the long dock to find deeper water to swim in. We took the ferry to Gilligan's Island Saturday morning. The ferry and the island were very crowded. Even though only 200 people are allowed on the island each day it's a small island and it fills up quickly. It's a favorite daytrip for local extended families and they know the best places to go early to set up their grills, chairs. etc. There are no services on the island so you need to bring everything you'll need. The resort doesn't rent folding chairs but that would be very helpful since many of the areas have roots and stones which are not particularly comfortable for sitting. We snorkeled along some mangrove island roots and saw lots of Yellow Jacks. The current was very strong but we drifted with it so it worked out okay. All in all, the resort was pretty much what we expected as far as the rooms but the views, landscaping, and Alexandra's were better than we expected. Copamarina was a restful, quiet break from the hubbub of San Juan. I'm glad we decided to explore the south side of the island.

The resort is small, but had everything we needed - a sandy beach, plenty of chairs and shady areas, several pools, water sports (kayaks, catamarans, snorkeling equipment, dive trips), and a beautiful setting for relaxing. The kids especially enjoyed the large grassy areas, the playground, and the inter tidal zone where they found many sea creatures. Outside of the resort we enjoyed hikes in the Guanica Dry Forest - the Copamarina offers a good trail guide. The spacious villa was great for us (6 adults & 2 kids). There were 3 bedrooms and we set up 2 cots in one of the bedrooms to accommodate everyone. There was a complete kitchen, dining room, living room, 2 bathrooms, a wrap-around porch with ceiling fans, plus a washer and dryer. Being in the first floor villa, we were able to use the expansive grassy area as our \"own\" front yard. And to add my opinion to a couple previously addressed issues: 1. Gilligan's Island - It was a nice boat ride and the snorkeling was fun. I would say it's good for first time or infrequent snorkelers, but if you've done nice reef snorkeling then you might find this disappointing. If you do go, be sure to snorkel all the way to where the \"river\" almost reaches the ocean, as that is where we saw most of the fish hiding among the mangrove roots. And that way you can swim back on the other fork of the \"river.\" 2. Grassy Water - The water directly in front of the resort did have a lot of sea grass in it, but I didn't find that a problem. (It's just grass, right?) If you think you might be uncomfortable stepping in it, a pair of water shoes would be a good idea. The only small problems we had are listed below. They're quite minor, and would not stop us from returning. 1. Ice machine in freezer not working, and no ice trays. We went to the ice machine in another building for ice. 2. Bottom shelf on fridge door was missing, which limited storage space. 3. Oven broiler tray missing, so we couldn't use the broiler. 4. Not enough of some kitchen items (knives, small bowls, coffee cups).

We had never dove the reefs in Puerto Rico, and their website claims that they are a \"world-class dive resort\" which was completely false. The first night there we went to the Dive Shop to book a dive for the following morning. The girl wrote us on the schedule with no problem, but then twenty minutes later called our room to inform us there wasn't going to be diving the next day because it was the divemaster's day off. At normal world-class dive resorts such as those in the Caymans and Sydney, there isn't a day with no diving available. That was only the beginning. We went to the shop again to sign up for the following day when the instructor was to return, and the same girl took our names. The following morning we woke up at 7am for a 730 dive trip, only to find out when we got to the dock that the diving was canceled again. \"The weather was too bad.\" It wasn't raining. There were no waves. More or less, the divemaster appeared very hungover and not in a the mood to go out. We were furious because already two of the four days we planned to dive had been wasted. Four days at Copamarina for the two of us alone cost $2700, and only $1040 went toward the actual fees for the room. The first meal we had at their on-resort restaurant, \"Las Palmas,\" cost over $50. We had ordered a cheeseburger, a chicken quesadilla, and four beers between us. When the bill arrived, the beers were $6.43 each! We consulted the waiter, in shock that the local Puerto Rican beer, Medalla, would cost that much. He said it didn't matter if we had ordered that or Heineken, that all the beers were $6 flat rate. Medalla at the PR liquor stores were $1 per bottle, so Copamarina definitely got their money off of us. We did not do an all inclusive package because we planned to go away from the resort a few times for meals and entertainment, unaware that Guanica is in such a remote location that we would have had to take at least a forty minute taxi ride to reach a city. After spending so much money already, we wanted to spare the cost of a taxi, so we decided to do the best we could to eat light and not order any alcohol, which completely ruined the stay. It's very sad that a beer has to break your wallet so much that you're unable to enjoy yourself on vacation. We are always willing to spend money on whatever we want, and we understand that vacations are expensive, but at the same time, we're too smart to get ripped off that much just to enjoy a few brews. Also make note that if you are looking for any sort of nightlife, this is NOT the place for you! This resort has two pools, many water activities, like scuba (sometimes), snorkling, sailing, and jet-skis, two hot tubs, a fitness center, and two restaurants, both of which are pricey after you add in the drinks (one can of coke = $3, a bottle of water $3) with no refills, as well as a little store with snacks and sunscreen available. Positives about the resort: The landscaping was beautiful! We could not have asked for a more perfect scenery from our balcony (oceanfront room). There were all varieties of palm trees, orchids, and flowers all around the resort, as well as the greenest grass in all of Guanica. The rooms were very clean and cozy, too. If we had not been there to dive and had we bought the all-inclusive package, we probably would have been more satisfied.", "Date": "April 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cOverrated and overpriced\u201d", "Author": "swimmom2mg", "ReviewID": "UR14662288", "Content": "We're at Copamarina now, and I must admit we're a bit disappointed.

We arrived late last night, and even though our room is quite a ways from the restaurant, we could still hear the live music blaring in our room past 11. We had gone there for a drink right after arriving and the music was so loud, you could not even have a conversation. When I asked politely when the music would stop for the night, I was told 11pm (even though it was past 11 at the time) and there was nothing they could do. (How about asking them to turn down the volume a tad??!) Our kids are 14 and 12, and while they are finding ways to entertain themselves, there aren't a lot of other kids here their ages. Most of the kids are quite a bit younger. So far, the food (have just had one meal - the breakfast buffet - is just ok. Cost of the buffet was $16/each and they charge our 14 year old as an adult. Again, not worth it for the quality. We're going to eat in and around Guanica the rest of the trip, as much as possible. And while none of us are saying it, we are wishing we were back in Playa del Carmen at Shangri-La Caribe (where we went two years ago...they SO spoiled us!). I hope things turn around for the better, but right now I would not recommend Copamarina to my friends, especially for the price. It is a beautiful place though, just don't expect top notch service or a great beach (we knew about the beach before arriving). I am so hoping things get better.

Coming from NY, Puerto Rico seemed like a good option. So we checked out the Trip Advisor reviews, looked at the hotel prices and decided on the Copamarina Beach Resort. We were not disappointed. We flew from Newark into Aguadilla arriving after midnight and the drive to the resort was straightforward -- though you absolutely need a rental car. From the town of Guanica to the resort, you do have to drive along a narrow, windy road, so drive slowly and carefully especially at night. The resort was quiet, with excellent facilities. The pools and hot tubs were perfect for relaxation. And it was an easy drive to towns such as Ponce. We also spent a day going to El Yunque -- a fascinating spot but not an easy drive at all from Guanica -- I'd suggest saving it for a different trip (e.g., from San Juan or the Eastern shores of Puerto Rico). The hotel's restaurant is excellent, but we wanted to try other places as well. We enjoyed Rinc\u00c3\u00b3n Argentina in Ponce and Pito's Seafood, on Route 2, East of Ponce -- the service and food was excellent at both. The Blue Marlin in Guanica was fun and provided local color. There are plenty of fast food places around as well if you prefer that. The hotel staff were friendly and polite. The grounds were immaculately kept. They have a computer set up in a lounge for checking email. When it was down on one of the days, they let us use their office computer to print out our boarding passes. Some of the other reviews have commented on the beach. My step-daughter complained about sand flies at the beach but was quite content to sun herself by the pool. I went to Gilligan's Island and enjoyed the water, but didn't find it as impressive as the reviews would suggest. And the snorkeling was also unimpressive (lots of fish, but most were fairly drab). Apparently, they had to dock the boat in a different location because of hurricane damage so this may have accounted for the discrepancy in the reviews. The dry forest was interesting. The hotel distributes an excellent, illustrated brochure for those interested in hiking through it and seeing the botanical and animal life. The rooms were clean, comfortable and in typical Caribbean style. One night there was a family with multiple loud children in the adjoining room but they left the following day. We couldn't tell if the walls were thin or the sound was traveling through the door that connected our room to theirs. Or whether they were just extremely loud children. (But we think it was the latter.) I suspect they were less elegant than the rooms in the hotels on the East Coast; they were definitely less elegant that the rooms in the beach hotels where I've stayed in San Juan such as the Caribe Hilton. But our week's stay cost us about 1/3 of the price that we would have spent at any of those places for 3 travelers/2 rooms. Overall, the Copamarina was just what we wanted: a quiet, friendly, laid-back, relaxing spot to catch some rays and get a flavor for the area.

Our main complaints were lack of freshness and low quality, which we found unforgiveable from such a luxurious ($$$) property . While our family of 4 (mom, dad, 22 year old and 12 year old) hails from the S.F. Bay Area and has high standards when it comes to food, we travel frequently and try to eat simple local food because it's the freshest and usually the most tasty. Unfortunately, nothing seemed fresh at the cafe. The warm fruit salad looked like it had been stewing in its own juice for quite a while and the shrimp in the casa dia had a decidedly over-the-hill odor. Even just a basic turkey sandwich was made with gelatinous pressed meat and served on squishy bread--hardly what one would expect at a high-end resort where most guests are at least somewhat health conscious. As much as we loved the property, we left after just two nights although we were scheduled to stay for five. Our stomachs was rumbling and our 12 year old was bouncing off the walls since she was pigging out on the only food she could stand: chips and ice cream from the snack shop. NOTE: We must add that the food at the Alexandra Restaurant, which only serves dinner, is very good. This establishment is formal and not appropriate for small children. It is also quite pricey.

The Summary: The resort is exactly as advertised: a very quiet retreat ideal for family vacations. The staff are superb, the grounds and pools lovely, and the food at Alexandria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very good. The beach is pretty but not great for swimming, but the short ferry trip to a nearby sand cay is wonderful. Getting off resort can be challenging \u00e2\u20ac\u201c journey times are long \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but otherwise this is a great place for a secluded getaway. The Details: If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for a very quiet, unhurried escape this is the resort. We stayed for nine days on an all-inclusive package with ocean view rooms. The occupancy rate seemed less than 30 percent \u00e2\u20ac\u201c most days we had the pools to ourselves, and we could always eat on the beautiful outside terrace of Alexandria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Restaurant at the time we liked. The staff here are excellent. We used the baby-sitting services for our 3 year-old, who loved being pampered and was soon on first name terms with the registration desk. The rooms are fine \u00e2\u20ac\u201c certainly not a four-star experience, but bright, clean and with great views. The pools are small but great for the kids \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we spent little time on the beach (see later comments), but spent a lot of time near the main pool. The entire time we stayed at the hotel the beach was officially \u00e2\u20ac\u0153closed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd due to pollution. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t clear why, and immediately offshore the water was fine. We snorkeled about a \u00c2\u00bc mile offshore at a small reef, where the water was crystal clear and the fish plentiful. Gilligan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Island is still closed (the dock was destroyed in a recent hurricane), but the small sand cay we visited on the local ferry was gorgeous and great fun. The beach here is pristine, and we could float down the beach in the current into a shallow pool. Good beachcombing, too. Alexandria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is a good restaurant that catered well to adults and kids. The menu was long, the seafood especially good, but after nine days I was ready for something new. As others had mentioned, the prices are high so the all-inclusive option seemed like a good deal. Going Places: The Copamarina is on the far southern coast of the island, and situated down a long and windy cliff road that gives a lovely sense of isolation but makes for tough travels. Our GPS system (TomTom) failed miserably to get us places, and all but the main highways seemed crowded with cars, trucks, chickens, lizards and the laziest dogs in the world. Ponce is about an hour away, and even nearby La Parguera is over 45 minutes. A few comments (see other entries too): - Paradise Scuba/La Parguera. The town of La Parguera feels like a one horse town, but Luis at Paradise Scuba is worth the trip. We did the afternoon snorkeling and bioluminescent bay trip at $50 a head, and had a great time. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re experienced swimmers and snorkelers let them know and try and avoid the first \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shallow\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd snorkel location, because the deeper reefs are excellent. We had low expectations for the bioluminescent bay based on comments online, but it was amazing (we had a moonless night, which helped). - Ponce. The old town was prettier than I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d thought and worth an hour. We actually made the trip to see the Ponce Art Museum (Museo de Arte de Ponce) and got there just in time: curators were literally taking paintings off the walls. The museum will be closed very soon, so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make the trip to see the fantastic Pre-Raphaelites, etc. (We got lucky, and an art restorer gave us a personal tour and showed us the paintings being removed from frames and cleaned). - Rio Camuy Caves. DO NOT GO! The caves are closed due to an accident. - Arecibo. Assume a three hour trip each way.

I simply felt obligated to put something on the internet to discourage other more experienced divers from making the same mistake that I unfortunately did. I do wreck diving in the deep and cold waters of New England year round and have gone diving all over the world. After reading about the amazing wall diving in Puerto Rico I decided to go there with my family on vacation. After 3 or 4 phone calls I booked a week long series of dives at Copamarina. I even called there the day before our trip to check if things were still OK. On the morning of our arrival I called the dive shop to see if the boat was going out that afternoon as planned. I was then told that the dive boat was \"broken\" and that there would be no diving all week. Suffice to say, I was devastated. I asked if they could help me to find another boat. They were extremely unhelpful and hung up the phone on me even though I was not being rude or impolite about the situation ( I would prefer to think that we were disconnected by accident, but I am not sure that was true). I explained that I had spent a lot of money to come to Copamarina and that I had made all my vacation plans on the assumption that they were a world class diving resort with regularly scheduled boat trips. I was then told that the real reason the boat was \"broken\" was that they didn't have a minimum of 3 people to go, and that this was true for the entire week.. Base on other people's similar accounts on this web site, it seems like the boat is \"broken\" with astonishing regularity. Is there some reason why they couldn't be honest and tell me this ahead of time so I could have made plans to go elsewhere in Puerto Rico?? Instead I found myself trapped in a less than optimal situation. I called the manager 3 times and spoke to people who said that he/she would call me right back, but no one ever did. Funny how the management seem so fastidious about replying to negative feedback on the internet, but they don't want to deal with customers who are genuinely upset. Ultimately I went to Parguera 20 miles away and dove with Paradise Dive Shop and West Divers both of whom were excellent. The wall diving was extremely impressive and worth the trip. Just for the record, Parguera divers is no longer operating even though they are still listed on the internet as a dive charter in the same area. The real problem is that the management of the Copamarina should stop falsely advertising that they are a world class dive resort comparable to other such resorts. Its simply not true. It is sad that no one in the hotel administration seems to have any sense of vision. They are sitting on one of the best places to dive in the Carribean, but they do not seem to support the dive shop adequately enough to truly make it a world class diving destination like the Caymans or Aruba. They easily could attract many more divers if they simply got their act together As far as the Copamarina resort itself , I have no complaints. The grounds were beautiful, the service was excellent and the food was well prepared. The local economy would greatly benefit if they really tried to develop their natural diving resources. This would also have a trickle down effect on the amount of business in the other dive shops in the area. Maybe they should talk to each other and get better organized. It would be a win/ win situation for all. SO BEWARE.

Like I said the property was very well taken care of and the staff from front desk, maids, wait staff, beach attendants, bartenders and management were wonderful. They were always pleasant and were readily available if you needed anything. We were expecting a three star resort, And in all honesty that is what it is. We stayed in a Two Star Hotel in Hawai.i once and compared to that Two Star Hotel, Copamarina is a FOUR. It's clean. It's maintained nicely. the grounds are very well manicured. The pool area and beach area is more than adequate. We did not have transportation so we did not venture off too much. We did the Bioluminiscent Bay thing and it was \"ok\". Our driver took us on a little toor of Gaunica which was neat. Did not go to Gilligans Island. Some people that went said it was nice, others said it was so so. On our trip back to San Juan we had our driver pick us up early and we spent the last afternoon in the Isla Verda area and visited several hotels and the beach area there. The beach and water was very nice but very very windy. This area had way too much going on, it was somewhat hectic like being in a big city. We preferred the peace and quiet of Copamarina. If I could make two suggestions to Copamarina they would be: #1 Work on the water around the pier and beach area and make it somehow more inviting and attractive. #2 Keep the Bar open later and have more late night entertainemnt. The music and singer in the bar area was nice but maybe have an additonal area that had a stage performances. The Food, drinks and the Resort staff makes Copamarina a Four ranking to us. We will go back for sure!

The room wasn't anything special, and the lighting is terrible, but it was clean. I agree with a previous review where they stated this is a 3-star trying to be a 5-star. I would definitely not take their all-inclusive (we didn't) as the food is not that good and there are places you can drive to, if you like to search out local restaurants. Most everyone in the area speaks some English - and with our very limited Spanish we never had a problem in this part of PR. We found a breakfast place (panderia) down the hill from here (on the main st in Guanica village area - which is behind McDonald's off Rte 116) and had either fried eggs or an omelet with coffee and toast for about $7 for the two of us, compared to the Copamarina's breakfast buffet for about $40 and their $42 lunch for a sandwich/soft drink each. If you're squeamish about driving windy, hilly roads, don't go to the Copamarina - it's a very steep, narrow, curvy road for about 3 miles. The beach is full of sea grass - you can wade out to about mid-calf, and then you're in that slimy grass. We did go off the end of the boat pier where there is a ladder into the water, but it's only sandy just at the bottom of the ladder - the sea grass and muck is out there too. We weren't able to go over to Gilligan's Island because of previous storm damage, but they did take us out to another beach around a point via boat for $6 each. The people who went on the diving boat had to be towed back 6-7 mi, so I get the feeling that everything is not taken care of as it should be.

It was our anniversary break. This is a long review, so I'll try breaking it up into sections. Check-in: This was most disappointing and frustrating. NY -> San Juan takes about 4 hrs. From there, we drove 2.5 hours to get to the resort. We had made our booking through Travelocity, when we arrived, the resort didn't have a record of our booking. Ok, so that's probably Travelocity's fault. From this point on, things went downhill rapidly. They first asked me for my reservation number. I didn't have a printout and it took me some time to look it up on my pda+laptop. In the meantime they were on the phone with some travelocity agent. The receptionist said something like - \"this is why you should bring a paper record of your reservation\". Whatever. After 10 mins I found my travelocity email and gave her the numbers. I also forwarded the email to them since travelocity hadn't sent them anything yet. So now I have a record, and now she says \"thats a record you're giving us, not something we got from travelocity. this is why you should always book directly with us\". That is unacceptable. And that, to me, is the difference between a well known brand/chain and a one-off hotel. I'd bet any amount that a Hilton or Marriott would've given us a room immediately. Incidentally, travelocity had a lower rate than their website, which is why I booked there. At this point, she should have assigned us a room. What's the worst that could happen ? We would have bluffed and they'd have one more room to clean ? We were offered welcome drinks instead. We'd woken up at 5am and we were standing in that lobby at 6pm and all we wanted to do was get refreshed and take a break. It took 1.5 hours for the whole matter to be sorted out, we'd missed the sunset, and were extremely upset on the eve of our anniversary. The room: Average The room wasn't carpeted. You could argue that since its a beach resort etc, they avoid carpeting. But our beach resorts in Hawaii last month had carpeted rooms. There weren't bathroom slippers either. Not a big deal, but it just gets uncomfortable when you're back from the beach, wash up, and have to walk around bare feet since your beach slippers are dirty/wet. Bed was ok, our room was on the first floor, so the veranda opened into their gardens. The facilities : Excellent We weren't looking for a lot of activity on this weekend away. We were just looking to chill in the pools, jacuzzis, beaches etc. This was perfect. They have two jacuzzis/spas and 2/3 pools. This time of the year, they were empty most of the time. Hardly any children too. It was just the perfect secluded place we wanted. The pools and jacuzzi were open 24 hours and we loved it. You could replace towels till late in the evening which was nice. The restaurants were ok, the staff were friendly. Houskeeping was very neat. One more complaint : The phone stopped working the next morning. We informed the reception desk twice but it wasn't fixed during our stay. The beach : This beach was a bit disappointing. It does indeed have plenty of grass in the water. Even if you walk further west to the public beach area there's grass. The water is calm but doesn't appear as clear as it ought to because of this. However, you can take the ferry (6.5 roundtrip) to Gilligan island, a small isolated island about a mile off the resort. That has a very nice beach and i'd definitely recommend it. Eating out : This resort isn't in a touristy area at all. So your eating options are very limited. You could go to Ponce where you may find some small restaurants, but its a 40-min drive. There are other small towns in the vicinity, learning a bit of Spanish is certainly advisable. Other beaches : I'd definitely recommend Santa Playa and Boqueron. Lovely beaches for sunset, calm waters, active towns. We did jetskiing at Santa Playa, quite cheap at $48 for 2 people for 30 mins.", "Date": "January 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Haxtun, CO", "Title": "\u201cVery relaxing resort\u201d", "Author": "RBandJB", "ReviewID": "UR12366502", "Content": "Copamarina Beach Resort December 25, 2007-January 1, 2008 Trip Advisor member from NE Colorado This is a very quiet place for families and those wanting a relaxing vacation.

This time, I am writing a review for the exact OPPOSITE reason. I have never had a MORE satisfying experience. First of all, I would like to thank the staff of the Copamarina Resort for making sure my family and I had an incredble stay. Immediately, upon check in, I could tell this resort was there to please it's customers. We arrived a few hours before check in and I was feeling car sick. I was feeling quite cranky and unhappy......for about 30 seconds after arriving at the Copamarina. The staff could tell I was not feeling well and allowed us to check in early. They even allowed us to \"preview\" our suite and pick out which one suited us. We chose to upgrade to a very nice two room suite so my husband and I could enjoy some privacy. After being there a day, we realized that it would have been a better financial move for us if we would have purchased the \"all inclusive\" package. After having a casual conversation with one of the staff members about types of drinks she suggested, I jokingly mentioned to her about drinking away my kids' college fund. She suggested that we go all inclusive and promptly returned with the manager. He reviewed our charges and said that it would be to our benefit if we converted......even allowed it to be retroactive....which saved us a substantial amount of money. It cost our family of four 150.00 per day for the all inclusive plan. That's typically what we would spend on just dinner and drinks. I was so impressed that they allowed us to do that!! That they would consider our wallet before their own. The grounds were beautiful. The pools were very clean with a spectacular carribean view. The food was great.....and the drinks were even better!! I tried everything they suggested....the bartenders were superb! We stayed at 3 resorts all over the island. We had a good experience at all the resorts we stayed at, but Copamarina was the best.

The resort is located next to the dry forest reserve and there are great walking trails along the ocean with hidden beaches and great views.

We stayed 3 nights at the Copamarina, and 3 nights in Old San Juan. We absolutely LOVED the Copamarina. There were a few downsides, but I think the reason we loved it was because those downsides weren't particularly disturbing to us. Our first impression was the open-air lobby, which is very pretty, with orchids planted in the palm trees. The staff at the front desk was very nice, professional, and helpful. They upgraded our room when they heard we were on our honeymoon. Our room was very nice...large and clean. It wasn't overly luxurious, but definitely nice. The first night, we spent several hours enjoying the open-air bar/cafe (there are two restaurants: the cafe/bar, which is a casual menu, and Alexandra, which is fancier. ) The bartender was awesome (all the bartenders who served us during our stay were super attentive and friendly.) The drinks were great. We ordered some food off the cafe menu, and it was mediocre. We were so happy to be relaxing with drinks with a view of the Caribbean Sea, that we didn't care too much. Breakfast was great - the menu is pretty good: eggs benedict, etc. We took a sea kayak to Gilligan's Island, which is absolutely gorgeous (the highlight of the entire trip). I guess October is right in the middle of the off season, so there was no one there (very few people at the resort in general, which was great). Anyway, we kayaked around a cluster of islands, and swam on another deserted beach called Bellena Beach. Dinner at Alexandra that night was great. It wasn't the best thing I'd ever eaten in my life, but definitely better than the cafe. I liked the food. I thought the filet mignon was good. My husband got the Mofongo, which he liked. The second day we hiked in the Dry Forest, which is slightly overrated, but still interesting and a good little workout. Each night we relaxed in the hot tub, which was nice. We also enjoyed the pool nearest our room, and a few hours on the beach in recliners. As I mentioned in the beginning, there were a few possible downsides: - other posters are right - as far as night time entertainment. It's basically a guy playing guitar at the bar. We loved it. We weren't there to go clubbing, we were there to have some drinks, and enjoy each other's company. - Cafe food isn't great. But we liked the other restaurant. - other posters are right, the beach isn't good. We didn't care, though, because we live near the beach in the States, so we didn't feel disappointed. If you're looking for a really \"beachy\" time, you shouldn't go there. Their beach is short, and the bottom is mucky and there are lots of underwater plants. Gilligans Island is great though. That's all the bad parts. What we loved: the beautifully maintained grounds, deserted pools and hot tubs, Gilligan's Island, GREAT service without exception, awesome outside bar, nice room.

Well, I am happy to report that every positive review here is dead on. This resort is wonderful to stay at and is staffed with individuals of the highest caliber. I was amazed by the common concern that all staff members shared for the comfort of their guests. The maintenance and gardening crew, front desk, waiters and bartenders, cooks, pool and beach crew, store staff, etc... Everyone was so polite and helpful, and when needed were always willing to go above and beyond to ensure your visit was perfect. The resort was very clean and the grounds crew was out every day ensuring it stayed that way. The pool was cleaned every morning, I woke up early enough every day to see them doing so. The rooms were spacious, clean, and most certainly set the mood for relaxation. I booked a 4 night all inclusive. This was well worth the cost for me as I am a bit of a drinker and I love to eat! We were here for the first week of August, just after the local children were back in school. So the resort was very quiet, although it was still fully staffed! This time is considered part of their off season, however it was still a wonderful experience. The food was good at the outside cafe and very good for the inside fine dining. I was so conerned about the bar closing around 11:30pm and thought I would be left wanting a drink after, however I was so busy during the day that I never made it past 10:30pm any given night! This is good as there is no local night life. So if you're looking to have a busy day, a few drinks by the pool, and a good dinner and some relaxing music, then this is a place for you. If you're looking to go clubbing at night, then you need to look elsewhere. My only disappointment with the resort, and this is just personal preference, would be the beach. I enjoy a rough surf and diving into waves. The sea here is like a bathtub, very little movement and pretty warm. Obviously this will appeal to many, but may not for those used to a little action in the water.

I want to be very objective and fair here; so let me start with: the good: Very clean room....very clean, tiled bathroom; both surpirsed us! Nice balcony (room 210) opening to the sea and the grounds. We had an excellent dinner at Alexandra. Infact we ate a couple of times at Las Palmas Cafe too; with both we experienced prompet service and good food. At Alexandra we enjoyed a nice bottle of wine; Johnathan was our waiter and our glasses were never half full. The only negative will be below and has nothing to do with the food or service. Great job. We'll kept grounds, parking close to room, and a fair value. now....the bad: I'm a diver. The Copamarina does a disservice in billing itself as having a dive shop. There is no dive shop. The \"dive shop\" is the towel exchange building between the pools. It sells ice cream, candy, and bathing suits. There is simply no diving gear here...but it's worse....as a diver in a new area you want to talk to your dive master, meet him, talk about what dives you'll be doing, i.e; depth, decompression steps...their experience and such....basicly you want to see with whom you will share your risk with. The Copamarina dive shop was staffed by...two teenagers. All they could tell me was....you'll be diving the wall...be here at 7:30sharp. The complete lack of suba gear and inablity of staff to answer the most basic of questions was the real dissapointment of our stay. It would be more honest if they simply said they offered \"diving services\" not a dive shop/marina. The silver lining: I found Parguera Divers and it's excellent owner/dive master Angel. Angel returned my calls promptly...offered me his cell phone....but mostly....displayed complete competence and confidence....answering all my questions patiently...he ran an orgainzed boat with a good balance of profesionalism and humor and is fully bi-lingual.

The food and mixed drinks under the all inclusive plan were delightful and would rate 4 out of 5 for service and quality. The ocean is at a perfect height to put a lounge chair to sunbathe most of the day. If you would like to snorkel in deeper waters it is about 50 yards to swim out beyond the shallow waters. We have travel to places from Kona, Hawaii (stayed at the Fairmont Orchid) to the Westin in the Bahamas, and I honestly have to say this resort won hands down of all of them in between. It is not too crowded and the locals who vacation here are some very, very nice people. You do need to get the all inclusive which was exquisitely wonderful. You definitely need to go to Gilligan's Island. You take a 15 minute boat ride form the pier over to the island. It consists of an uninhabited island with rivers of mangroves that will lead you out to the main ocean. The snorkeling was pretty good and sights were very beautiful.

So, the highlights are the pool and the room. There is no room service and the food in the Palma's Cafe is not that great with the exception of the breakfast buffet. However, their service at the Cafe is great...too bad the food is not as described in the menu (e.g. teriyaki wings with little to NO teriyaki sauce, fish fillets that actually fish sticks, the Parcha sauce with little to NO Parcha (passion fruit) flavor) ... Now in our last night we decided to eat dinner at Alexandra's (their \"good\" restaurant). We understand that service has ups and downs but we were lucky enough to receive the WORST service ever during our dinner. We made reservations for 8pm as requested by their staff. We arrived and were taken to our table then we were told that Jonathan was our waiter ... no no it is Lorenzo ... but Lorenzo did NOT stopped at our table ever during the night. Around 20 minutes passed and the head-waiter noticed our long faces (I know we could have said something but for some time we were engaged in conversation) .. he stopped asking for our order...but we had not even been asked for our drinks ... ok, he took our drinks (no alcohol that night) and our dinner order...... waited ... waited.... people came in .. got to their tables ..ordered ..got their food.... 45minutes later we got ours. I noticed Lorenzo dancing around the tables serving others but never stopped by. Other waiters topped water glasses around ... not in our table ...my son ran out of soda .. nobody asked to get a new one until we stopped one of them ... nobody stopped and checked on our experience ... The food was bland in flavor (little seasoning on the fillet mignon) and in the case of my mofondo-de-camarones (mashed plantains with shrimp inside) the shrimps were not removed entirely from their shell which made eating the mix a stop-n-go affair.

The sole purpose of my hotel stay was to do a few scuba dives. The hotel itself is nice... 2 different pools and two different bars. Very nice grounds - nicely manicured. The room was fine - nothing fancy. Very small tv and I could hear the people in the room next door but other than those two things, room was fine. The beach in front of the resort was very nice - very uncrowded. But don't expect blinding white sand and a nice surf... it's more of a lagoon. But it was relaxing.. and the canopy beds on the beach were very cool (even thought I never laid on one). Anyway, I arrived Friday afternoon and had dinner at the resort bar - food was fine (service a little slow). Saturday morning went diving with the on-site dive shop... decent dives (two morning dives) but the surf was a little rough during the hour boat ride back to the resort from the dive spot. During the return boat trip, three people got sick, including my friend that I was diving with. So we didn't go back out for the single afternoon dive (I don't think the boat went back out either). That afternoon at 4:30 PM, I got a message (on my hotel room phone) from the dive shop that all the Sunday dives were cancelled. So I went to the shop to try and make other arrangements (again, this is the only reason I was even there). They seemed indifferent and weren't helpful.. I asked if there were other shops in the area (I had read about one that was about 30 minutes away). They gave me the name and number but by then, the shop was closed. Later (after going back to the dive shop a couple of times), they gave me the phone number of the other captain. I gave him a call at around 7:00 pm and he said they that did they did have room. So I went to the front desk to see if I could get a late (1:00 pm) checkout (since I wouldn't get back to the resort until noon). I was told I would have to wait and ask them in the morning... well, that wouldn't work since I had to confirm with the other shop that night. Not big issues but on a 3-day dive trip, losing an entire day of diving is a pretty big inconvenience. And the resort did not handle it properly (to say the least).

This is the first time I am writing a review on trip advisor, largely because I chose the property based on trip advisor reviews. I hope this is helpful. Also, I travel a lot for business and have stayed at many outstanding resorts, so I think I'm a pretty good judge of things. The Copamarina was a great choice for us -- my wife, 10 year-old son, and 6 year-old daughter. It is a beautiful property with grounds that are immaculately maintained and located in a visually stunning part of Puerto Rico. We have stayed on more \"exotic\" islands and this area in SW PR rivaled many of those places. We are an active family. My kids are outstanding swimmers and athletes, and we were active the entire time with great activities. Obviously, with young children, their enjoyment largely dictates the quality of the vacation. They never wanted to leave the resort! We did not do the all-inclusive, though next time we will. The area around the hotel, after the beautiful forest ends, is largely poor and there are not many good restaurants. The food at the property restaurants was good, and sometimes very good, but not great. But certainly much better than anything else around. How good? One night, the former Governor of PR sat at the table next to us. I assume that means its OK! Part of what makes this place great are the people that work there. The staff( Wilmer, Irving, JJ, Lisbeth, Rosa, etc.) are amazing and made us and our kids feel totally at home. Meet these people and befreind them -- they added so much to our experience! The activities are something off of the Discovery Channel. The pools are beautiful and inviting. Also, of major importance to us, the beach stays very shallow for like 50 yards out, which is a total stress releiver when traveling with a 6 year old. A lot of how much you like a vacation is about expectations. So to level set yours about the Copamarina -- it is not a super luxury hotel in any sense of the word. It's funny -- I almost don't want to say too much and make this place too popular! But I want to be honest, because trip advisor helped us out. If you're looking for a Four Seasons experience, you will be disappointed. There was a couple there who were bemoaning that it wasn't nearly as nice as Fiji or Hawaii. Duh, it's Puerto Rico!

Next time we will choose our room based on location versus ocean view, etc. The walk from the far rooms is more like a hike and with the kids constantly forgetting something in the room, my husband and I felt like ping pong balls. Those rooms are secluded, private and very quiet though. The closer rooms are probably louder but the convenience, for us would be a huge plus. We preferred the rooms on the ground floor as they have access directly to the beach and main grounds but the view from the second floor was better. The food was good and plentiful. We all put on a bit of weight. Alexandra served a paella one night the was out of this world. The only criticism we would offer of the fine restaurant was that it was inconsistent. The food was always good but the same dish didn't taste the same each time. I ordered flan every night and it was different each time. The lobster risotto was to die for two nights in a row.

Everything was perfect, except for the beach at that specific location. If you like bats, beautiful cactus, limestone caves and lots of interesting birds, the dessert to the north is beyond words - I could go back just for that aspect. Prior to staying here, I did some research on Tripadvisor. Most people were concerned with the beach, which has its problems, but when you compare the best locations in PR, it's at the top of the list. Take El Conquistador for example - this is a great resort with all of the amenities but you have to take a ferry to go to the beach, and there is no snorkeling location nearby. Or, if you were to compare it to Culebra accomidations, you can find a location on Flamenco beach but you have to buy your own groceries. I could go on and on, but the only drawback to this place is the beach, and it is a short ferry ride away to Gilligan's Island, a mangrove outcropping just southeast of the location. So lets talk about the most castigated aspect of this location - the beach. Copa is at the edge of a bay, approximately three quarters of a mile north of the edge of the reef line. As a result, there is little wave action, and LOTS of sea grass. It's just a normal part of that location. It does not feel good on the feet, and I do not recommend going into it - but that's not Copa's fault. Why do I say that? Well, it's very difficult (and for good reason) to get permits to build resorts on or next to reefs because of the damage they tend to inflict in terms of runoff and traffic. So if you want your reef at your doorstep, you may want to go somewhere else where you don't have everything else Copa offers. That said, getting to reef - well, the FISH, in particular, is not difficult. There are four ways to go - a $6.42 ferry to Gilligan's Island, a $45 two hour snorkeling trip, by kayak or by swimming (only skilled triathalets should attempt this). GILLIGANS ISLAND A lot of folks here have critisized Gilligan's Island. Not worth the time, they say - too trashy - no fish, and no reef. Well here is the low down. I went through the island, around the island and on one of the trails. I went everywhere that one could go by foot or by swimming. There are five sections for exploration. The first is by foot. The foot trail on the northern tier is difficult, often slippery, and you WILL find trash nearby. That is because the college kids from Ponce and Mayaguez use Gilligans as a recreational location and are too drunk to clean up after themselves. You will find some of this trash - mostly pop cans - on the northern side of the island, along with sea grass. Although teeming with minows, its a waste of time for snorkelers. Your best bet is outside on the southern, ocean-facing side and the two rivers that stream down from east to west. On the southern, outer edge of the island you will find some of the most beautiful and numerous fish colonies in the Carribean for snorkling (I should know as I've done most). They are under the mangroves and number in the hundreds. If you swim south towards the breaking water (which is about a half mile out) you will find about 20% reef and occasional fish. Be forewarned, however - the current is VERY strong. You should only attempt to swim out to the reef if you have the stamina and endurance to withstand the flow of water. I recommend going along the outside of the northern edge of the island, using the hanging mangroves to steady you against the current, until you get to the far east end of the island. Once you hit the eastern edge you can stand and walk to the river mouth, and then drift snorkle down back to the west end where you first arrived on the boat. There are two rivers that merge into one - the north and south river. I did both several times and the southern one is the best for fish viewing. The trick here is NOT to look down as you won't see anything - the fish are all under the rocks and mangroves, under the shadows. You should wait until noon as there will be less shadow. Here you will find approximately 20 different species of fish, mostly babies, but some very large adults (who are feeding) hiding under the rock. Brace yourself under a mangrove and watch them peer out to see you. Once you get back to near the dock, where most of the people and children are, you might think there are no fish - but alas! There are hundreds. Minows, baby Sergant majors and in the little alcoves, crabs and shrimp. I also saw two VERY LARGE baricuda cruising through for a quick meal. THE SNORKELING TRIP One thing you should know is that warm weather and hurricanes have done damage to the Carribean reef system, with some reports showing that almost 90% of reefs are dead or dying. This is true, so don't be surprised if you dont see something from the cover of national geographic. That said, there are reef colonies and fish nearby. The snorkeling trip, which is a bit steep, is good to see coral, but not so much for fish. You are basically ferried straight out ot near the breakwater where the reef begins. I saw more fish in one spot at Gilligans than in the entire reef trip. I did see beautiful brain coral, finger coral and other coral colonies on the trip. If you MUST take it, however, you may be able to convince a local in the town nearby to take you there for less. If fish are you thing, stick to the island. It takes some daring, strength and patience, but you will see amazing biodiversity.", "Date": "February 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Marcos, California", "Title": "\u201cRelaxation, location, great diving.\u201d", "Author": "Zwithapggb", "ReviewID": "UR6623324", "Content": "We didn't actually stay here, but we will next time.

We were traveling with a teenage son. We all loved it. The drive from San Juan Airport was not as bad as I thought from other comments. We didn't want to be driving on unfamiliar roads for 3 hours, so we arranged a vacation package with transfers included. Our driver knew the roads well and it took us only 2 hours. The roads were wonderful - large grassy dividers and the most spectacular mountain scenery. The hotel grounds were lush with palm trees, flowers, cacti and succulents. The pictures on the website do not do it justice. My compliments to the landscapers. Our room was not large, but bright and cheerful. Our patio had a ceiling fan with high hedges on each side for a little privacy. Overall, our room was clean, but some attention needs to be given to the baseboards in the bathroom. The bathroom was a nice size with a long counter, but needed brighter lights. These are the only negatives for my entire stay. The shower was wonderful and there was always plenty of hot water. When everything else was so beautiful, I could live with the lighting in the bath. The rooms also had neat shutters which had glass behind them, so you could open the shutters, but not worry about bugs coming in. We did the all inclusive. We were expecting a mediocre restaurant after reading some other reviews, but we loved the food. The breakfasts and lunches were great. Eating these meals outside was pleasant. The \"made to order\" omelets were delicious. The chef also made Belgian waffles on request. We looked forward to the dinners. We dressed up a bit and opted for the air-conditioned dining room each night, as we had already been outside all day and we loved the dining room. The staff in the dining room were top notch. They could not have been nicer. Maybe they corrected the problem other reviewers had with dried out food. We ordered our steaks and lamp chops medium rare and they were perfect. The white asparagus with Spanish cheese and ham as an appetizer was delicious. They flavored their little pats of butters with a fruit, I believe it was guava. They were yummy. We had asparagus as a side dish several nights and it was never canned. It was cooked to perfection, with a slight crunch. Don't leave without trying the mango sorbet -- it is to die for! The chocolate sin was also fabulous. We thought this was a fine restaurant. If there was ever a problem, the staff would bend over backwards to remedy it. One waitress even brought out the bag of the type of coffee they used, as I had inquired. I still miss the after dinner Puerto Rican coffees. I enjoyed the house wines, but I don't pretend to be a wine expert. We stayed elsewhere in Puerto Rico after the Copamarina, and I have to say that the Copa's pina coladas were the absolute best. They also made a specialty drink with coconut milk, chocolate and cinnamon that is very good. The beach was great for relaxing. You could pull chaise lounges into the ocean. We wanted to rent a motor boat, but just ran out of time, as we had one day of rain. Gilligan's Island was a lot of fun. We took the ferry. The dive shop employee told us it would take us 20 minutes to kayak there with a group he was taking out. I had seen a woman on the food network (or travel channel) who kayaked to the island and she looked really winded. You are rowing against the current in one direction, so unless you've had some experience, or are in top physical condition, take the ferry. It is further than you think. Gilligan's Island is a mangrove island which has a natural lazy river running through it. I recommend renting fins at the hotel's dive shop to help you swim against the current. You swim all the way to the end, which can take 25 minutes, and then the current carries you back in about 2 minutes. This is the best lazy river you can find. You can also see small colorful fish and tiny crabs on and below the mangrove roots, so take masks. It is not, however, a major snorkeling type area. Security was excellent at the hotel. There were always guards about and they seemed to take their work seriously. The staff was terrific. Everyone was friendly. We had one small glitch where we believe the hotel received incorrect information from the tour company about our transfers. We didn't find out until the night before we were leaving. They had us leaving really early, thinking we had a flight and we did not . We were merely leaving for the Hotel El Convento in Old San Juan and didn't want to leave the Copamarina that early. We did not think they could remedy this situation this late at night, but they did! So we had the entire next morning to enjoy our last breakfast outdoors and take a few more pictures.

We had driven by and walked around Copamarina on our first trip, and decided to return this June, for a two-night, three-day, all-inclusive stay. I have to say that the all-inclusive package is the way to go if you're going to stay here. Otherwise the price of the rooms, and especially the food, will seem very expensive. If you use the facilities (particularly one of the two HobieCats on site) and eat and drink to your hearts' content, you will *more* than get your money's worth. The best thing about the resort is the service. Everyone is attentive, attractive, and speaks English well enough so there are no communications problems (although lemon and lime are apparently the same word in Spanish!). The next best thing is the location and the grounds -- on the undiscovered south coast of PR, the resort is wonderfully secluded (so if you're looking for a party, stay up north in San Juan), and the grounds are absolutely beautiful. The resort has been there for about 30 years (but you wouldn't know it to look at the buildings' interiors or exteriors), so the trees and grounds are mature and lush. It was great to have two pools and the Caribbean Sea to choose from for lounging around. People have complained about the sea grass under the water at the beach -- yeah - it's not the best beach I've ever seen. There is a boat trip (or you can take a kayak or a Hobie) to another beach that's even more secluded, or you can walk over to the public beach next door to the resort -- just be sure to bring your Copamarina ID with you to get back on the grounds! Security is excellent, so there aren't any interlopers using the facilities or beach. The food was good, not spectacular. However the wine served with dinner (a French brand called Fortant) was very nice, particularly since it was the house wine included with the all-inclusive package. Advice for the diner -- ask the server to ask the chef not to overcook your meat/fish/whatever. They seem to think the drier the better (they may just be worried about American phobias about undercooked food). Try the \"tomato surprise\" for lunch. Not really a surprise, but a great, healthy alternative to fried plaintains and \"assorted fried Puerto Rican Fritters.\" I would recommend Copamarina for families and couples who are looking for a low-key, relaxing getaway. Don't go there if you want nightlife, several restaurants or a big party. It's not a \"name brand\" American resort, so don't expect it to be one. I don't know what route one reviewer took to get to the resort -- but the highway from San Juan to Ponce is the best road on the island, and the road from Ponce to the resort is a close second. The San Juan - Ponce road goes through beautiful mountainous terrain, and the other road is boring, but very driveable.

We are a couple from Atlanta and DC in our mid-thirties. We were pleasantly surprised that many of the favorable reviews were indeed accurate (i.e., nice rooms and amenities, good service and romantic seclusion). We flew into Ponce and would highly recommend that option versus the 2+ hour drive to/from San Juan airport. Both JetBlue and Continental offer reasonable flights from the Northeast $200-300 r/t. We took a cab from Ponce to Guanica the first night and found the price high -- about $50. We ended up renting a car our last day and driving back for about $70. The roads weren't that bad and we did it with ease and did a one-way dropoff at Ponce Airport on our way out allowing for a little sightseeing in Ponce. THE GOOD: Copa's 24 hr jacuzzis and pools for quick dips at 3 in the morning. The all-inclusive breakfast (omelettes, toast and pancakes are best best). The Pina-Coladas and Daquiris were great (ask for 151 proof rum for the same price and more KICK). The room was nice/spacious with a fridge & large marble tiled shower (for 2), nice patio and semi-ocean view from a 'gardenview\" room. The canopied \"futons\" on the smallish beach were great. The beach didn't feel crowded for most of our stay. Tennis courts, dive shop and complementary fitness center were a plus. The service was generally good and the front desk staff accomodating for the most part. The in-room fridge came in handy because we went to the local supermercado to load up on snacks, drinks and basics. Free wireless Internet access was good although a little slow with limited connectivity the last two days. NY TV stations,and multiple HBO and Cinemax channels were good for mindless entertainment. The lunch menu had good eats for relatively cheap and once we had the HORRIBLE dinner fare (see below) -- we opted to order takeout lunch food from Las Palmas cafe around 6pm and enjoyed that in our room each nite (Palmas closes for lunch @6pm). THE BAD: The dinner menu and waiter service. The service was painfully slow and the Mahi Mahi was undercooked. When we asked them to reheat it, they simply took it in the back and slathered more lukewarm cream sauce on top of it. It bordered on disgusting and no we're not stuck-up 5-star wannabes. I forced myself to eat it because of the high price. My girlfriend's lobster and shrimp stew tasted quite 'fishy' (as did many of the seafood dishes). The humidity at nite and in the bathroom was pretty extreme. The bathroom ceilings \"sweated' like a sauna and we had a leaky faucet that was supposedly fixed the 2nd day but continued to leak. THE UGLY: Gilligan's Island...Don't believe the hype and brochures. It's a bit dirty with very small patches of usable beach. The warm/clear water attempts to make up for it, but was not enough.

After dragging 4 kids (10-17) from Vermont to Boston, spending the night in Boston, flying from Boston to San Juan, picking up the rental van, and driving a couple more hours in an unfamiliar place, the Copamarina was quite a sight for sore eyes! Driving into the resort and checking in at the beautiful outdoor lobby, I knew I had made a great choice. We stayed at the Copamarina through our vacation club, so I didn't have to foot the bill for our rooms. Trying to be economical, I had decided not to do the all-inclusive. But after the short, but winding drive to the resort, I changed my mind at the check-in, and bought the all-inclusive for all six of us on the spot. If you have a family, do yourself a favor and splurge on the all-inclusive. It was so nice not to worry about food or drinks...and the kids love getting all those frozen virgin cocktails any time they please. We really enjoyed the daytime staff, especially Ramon (if you see him, ask him for his special drink, it was delicious). If it was busy, they were on over-drive, but when they weren't too busy, they were happy to answer any questions you might have about the area. Many visitors to Puerto Rico never make it out of San Juan, which is really a shame, as the area surrounding the Copa is absolutely beautiful. All the local Puerto Ricans we encountered at the Airport smiled knowingly and told us how beautiful the area would be, and they were right! There are plenty of activities to keep you busy without ever going to town: tennis, kayaking, hiking the Dry Reserve and exploring the cave, visiting other beaches, and going to Gilligan's Island. There was a really nice public beach next to the resort with fabulous facilities, including basketball courts. If you get the all-inclusive, you can check out tennis equipment, the kayaks, beach towels, all sorts of good stuff. Due to the special climate of the Dry Reserve, it rarely rains at the Copa, even when it's raining all over the rest of the island. My family really enjoyed the evening meal together; it was fun to get a little dressed up and take our time enjoying the food. We especially liked sitting out on the patio. The food and service were usually excellent, however, we did notice that when the resort got busier, the quality of both took a little bit of a nose-dive. On the weekends, the resort gets quite busy, as many Puerto Ricans like to come with their families and enjoy the resort. I've found that when locals like to stay at the resort, it means that you're really getting your money's worth, as they are the experts! While you can get \"all-inclusive\" at the resort, it doesn't have that impersonal, cookie-cutter feel to it. By the end of the week, it seemed the entire staff knew my family's preferences and routines.

If you're bored easily by quiet places, or if you require impeccable grounds, four-star dining, and at-your-feet service, go somewhere else! (and don't complain on this site!) The Copamarina is laid-back, but an absolute joy. My boyfriend and I spent four days at the Copamarina, and it was heaven. We are young, but not terribly interested in nightlife -- we're happier to enjoy each other's company in a quiet place. This is the perfect spot for it. We flew in to San Juan from Boston, rented a car and drove to Guanica. The drive was not difficult, but we did run into bad traffic both ways, causing the trip to be around 3 hours -- so be wary of their claim that it's 90 minutes to SJ. It was wonderful to see the PR countryside. After we got there, we only used the car to drive to the entrance of the Guanica Dry Forest. I think the hotel was at or near capacity when we were there, but it never once felt crowded. I was amazed. I grew up in NC and had never been anywhere remotely Carribbean, so when people said the beach was bad I was expecting some kind of dirty black mud. Hardly! It's white sand and clear water. Not much to see in the water, but who cares? Certainly nothing worth complaining about. We had a 2nd-floor gardenview room, which had a nice balcony with a view out over the second (curvier) pool -- nice to sit and read there in the afternoon. It was lovely. I felt no desire to upgrade to an oceanview. We were hardly ever in our room anyway! We did the all-inclusive package based on other reviews on this site, and were happy we did. We enjoyed not having to worry about paying for drinks or finding lunch and dinner. A-i includes all drinks except bottles of wine, for those who are interested -- not to sound like a lush, but hey, these things matter! The restaurant is overpriced and less than stellar. I started to get tired of it after a couple of days. I had one meal that was nearly inedible (rubbery scallops -- a bad choice, in hindsight), but I also had the lamb chops which were really good. The house wine is not so good. I certainly wouldn't be pleased if I were paying full-price for my dinners. Try to get a reservation for a table outside -- it's much more pleasant than sitting inside. My favorite part of the trip was eating breakfast in the open-air cafe every morning. It was sunny and warm and beautiful, and the food was good. It was just the best possible way to start your day. The bacon was perfectly-cooked and plentiful :). The cafe is just a bar at night (no apps available, which would have been nice). It was usually nearly deserted. Sometimes they have live music, which is nice -- but sit far away from it as they turn the speakers up pretty loud so the diners on the restaurant's patio can hear it too. If you have any interest in nature whatsoever, do go to the Guanica Dry forest. There are lots of interesting birds to see early in the morning, and lizards as well. You can get a trail map from the hotel. Be sure to bring water and something to snack on, as it's quite hot when the sun comes up, and the ranger station has no food or drink for sale. Also, if you get the all-inclusive it includes the use of their Hobie Cats, which is a lot of fun. They also have kayaks. We didn't get to go on a snorkeling trip, but I would have liked to.

STretch out on a lounge under the covering in the water. The weather was perfect-perfect temperature and very dry, a nice breeze. It looked like a great place to come with young children. My husband was very happy with the dive staff and experience and enjoyed taking the small sail boat out every day-included in the all inclusive. I had a great massage in the spa. We enjoy good food and were very happy with the restuarant-loved sitting outside every evening having a leisurely meal on the patio with the guitarist playing. We always found plenty of selection, especially with the 2 specials every night. The staff in the restaurants were very friendly & worked very hard. Service is slow and relaxing-we enjoy not hurrying thru a meal-we do enough of that iin our everyday life. The all inclusive is definately the way to go. This is absolutely NOT the place to come if you want ritz and glitz, lots of nonstop activity, fancy shopping, poolside service. The last place we went to on one of the other islands was supposed to be one of the top-lots of fancy landscaping, lots going on-very impersonal, had walk to the beach and water-you weren't sure it was there, indifferent buffet dining that made me feel like we were a bunch of cattle.

For starters, we did not find any of the conditions listed as \"really bad points\" or \"bad points\" in their review, except that there was no bell hop and no beach side service. BFD!! Our room faced west so we saw a beautiful sunset from our balcony every day. The room had shutters so it was dark-WITH THE SHUTTERS CLOSED- but was light and airy when they were open. The beds (and pillows) were comfortable, and the bathroom was very clean. I belong to two swim clubs and know a clean pool from a dirty pool. I found the pool decks clean and the water gin clear.We ate at the restaurants for five days, and thought the food was excellent, but got a little bored because the printed dinner menu did not change for the five days. We would not recommend this resort for divers as the morning two tank dive left at 7:30am and the afternoon dive only goes down to 20 feet. Also we were told that there wasn't much to see on the reef. So we spent most of our time lounging by the pools, walking the beaches, sailing the Hobies, and ... well, you know. The staff was uniformly friendly and helpful, and fun to get to know.

Overall, we had a wonderful stay and reading all the previous Trip Advisor reviews were extremely helpful (love the web site). I would use the term to describe the resort as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153barefoot elegance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Just to give you some background, we were originally planning on going to Hawaii since our ideal island vacation includes not only great weather and beaches, but beautiful scenery and enchanting local sights. After waiting too long to book our vacation and the airfares skyrocketed, we reset our sights on the Caribbean. Puerto Rico seemed to fit our needs as being similar in those regards to Hawaii. I knew that staying in San Juan was not our idea of a relaxation, so I began looking elsewhere on the island. The fact that the Copamarina is on the southern side of the island was enticing since we were more apt to have a rain free vacation (because when you are paying the big bucks to get away, who wants their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beach vacation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ruined by rain). I booked the Copamarina through Expedia, which was featuring an every fourth night free special. We have never done an all-inclusive package before, but knowing that the hotel is not in the city, food options outside the hotel would be limited, and the fact that the all-inclusive seemed relatively reasonable, we decided to go with it. Overall, we were very happy that we decided to do the all-inclusive which not only included all food, drink (alcohol, wine, beer, soda etc.), tips, resort fee, and use of 1 hour of the water equipment daily. The best part of the all-inclusive was that there is no bill to sign or wait for after you order anything. GETTING THERE I had read some varying degree of concern about finding the hotel and driving in PR in general, but we had no trouble at all. We rented a car from the airport which was relatively hassle free and used the directions I had faxed from the hotel prior to departure. A car is highly recommended if you plan on leaving the hotel at all and we found one very reasonable at $200 for 8 days. The drive took exactly 2 \u00c2\u00bd hours on fairly major highway which was easy enough to navigate. Someone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earlier suggestion to bring a roll of quarters for the tolls was extremely helpful. The road off the highway to the hotel is curvy but not as scary as some previous reviewers made it seem. It reminded us of Hawaii in that respect. People do drive a little differently in PR with a lot of passing on the right, but we felt pretty comfortable wherever we drove. Checking in was not a problem and we had our choice of either a first or second floor room. They give you a badge for the all inclusive with your picture on it which also doubles as your room key. There is no one to help you with your bags, but that was fine with us. HOTEL GROUNDS AND ROOMS We found the hotel lovely and the rooms adequate. Every room has a patio or balcony depending on which floor you are on. Ours was very clean and spacious and we really had no complaints. Dirty hotels completely gross me out, so that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a requirement for me. There is no turn down service in the evening in case that is a deal breaker for you. We had requested a garden view room but had a very clear view of one of the pools and ocean. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure if that was considered and upgrade or not. I had heard previous reviews complain about the noise through the connecting doors between rooms, but the room adjoining ours was only occupied the last night so it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a problem for us. The grounds were wonderful and there are 2 adult pools and 2 baby pools which were very clean. It was easy to find a chair at all times at both the beach and pool. The pool water was a little chilly, but refreshing. There are also 2 hot tubs which were very hot. The beach has been adequately described by previous reviewers with the sea grass, and being a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beach lover\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I was a little nervous. It is true that the beach is not a swimming beach, but you can easily walk a short distance toward the public beach which was sea grass free. There are plenty of chairs on the beach, both with and without shade, and the cabanas were beautiful and comfortable if you can snag one. There weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too many children at the hotel and I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t suggest bringing them if they need to be constantly entertained. I would say the hotel is definitely more geared for adults. FOOD We found the food in general to be very good. I managed to gain 5 pounds in the week if that means anything. Breakfast at Las Palmas was mostly a buffet, but a few days during the week when there weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as many guests at the hotel you ordered off the menu. We preferred the buffet since we liked not having to wait for our food to be prepared when hungry for breakfast. They pretty much have all normal breakfast type food available. Lunch you could either sit at Las Palmas and eat, or have them pack it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to go\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for a road trip or even to eat on the beach. We found the all of the lunch items very good and even got a lunch to take with us to the airport when we checked out which turned out to be a GODSEND. Dinner was good, although I do have to say the menu got a little sparse being there eight nights. With the all-inclusive you get a choice of appetizer, main course, and dessert. My husband was in his glory with the lobster half the week. The prices are steep if you are paying out of pocket, but I would say typical of hotel restaurants. We ate on the late side each night since there is not much else to do in the evening, and the three courses averaged 1 hour and 45 minutes to get through. The service, although a little slow, (but like I said, we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in a hurry) was very good. I did wish their wine selection was more extensive. The other suggestion I have for the hotel was that there are a few tables outside which were difficult to obtain a reservation for, and the best thing about them was the guitarist who plays in the evening. Most people however have to eat indoors where you unfortunately can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear him play. It is too bad the windows in the restaurant aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t able to be opened to enjoy the tropical breezes since it was beautiful out in the evening. There is no room service as others have mentioned, but that did not bother us since we never bother with it anywhere we stay. You can also have dinner \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to go\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to eat in the restaurant. STAFF AND SERVICE We found the restaurant staff and recreation staff to be wonderful. A special thank you goes out to Irving, who is the activities/waterfront director, for telling us about special local spots to check out and things to do and see. He was unbelievably helpful and knows a lot about the area. Some of the staff occasionally comes around to the beach and pool closest to Las Palmas asking if you want anything to drink. It would be nice if they came around more often, but since we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do much moving on the days we just hung by the beach and pool, getting up to get a drink was actually a good thing. One of the few complaints we had is that everyone at the front desk we encountered during the week was by far the LEAST helpful of all the employees at the hotel. They often seemed annoyed if you asked a question, and when we went to check out, they informed us we had used the phone to make a long distance call and wanted to charge us 50 cents for it. It obviously wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the money that I was concerned about, but when I told the woman that we did not make any calls from the room since we had our cell phones (which worked quite well I might add) she started speaking in Spanish to her coworker about me, and gave me a snotty reply that she would have to speak to her manager about removing the charge. Thankfully, I did not get charged in the end. ACTIVITIES We found it hard to leave the resort but did see some nice sights in PR. One day we drove past Ponce to the Banos de Coamo (which I discovered in our PR book and not even many PR natives seem to know about). They are naturally heated 110 degree freshwater pools. They were fantastic! We were a little hesitant at first when we got there since we were the only tourists, but after a few minutes many of the locals asked us where we were from, and engaged us in conversation. We also ventured up North to the Arecibo Observatory to see the radio telescope which was fun, although it took a while to get there. It was nice to see more of the island though. We also tried to see the Camuy Caves but unfortunately they closed just as we got there due to rain. We tried to call ahead but no one answered the phone. We took 2 walks/hikes in the Guanica Dry Forest which we loved. Be sure to get a guide/map at the front desk. Our favorite was definitely the Meseta trail along the water which has many beautiful cactus and plants. We also hiked a longer one up to the visitor center and back to the ocean. The forest is beautiful, and I wish we had more time to explore it. It is just down the end of Rt. 333 on which the Copamarina is located. We took the boat to Gilligan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Island which was enjoyable. We went on a Sunday when there were lots of locals there, so if you want it more to yourself, go during the week. We swam up one of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rivers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd through the mangroves against the strong current and had it float us back down which was fun. It is like a natural lazy river. There isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much else to do out there but there are little secluded beaches around the island if you are looking for more privacy, but you have to be a little creative to find them. SUMMARY There is still so much of the island we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see, so a return trip will definitely be in order in our future. Overall, we loved the Copamarina and Puerto Rico. It was exactly what we were hoping for, and expected based on previous reviews. If you demand high class service, lavish amenities, and endless entertainment, this is not the place for you. If you are looking for a quiet jewel of a resort, with pretty much guaranteed good weather, reasonable prices, helpful and pleasant staff, and clean and adequate rooms and facilities, than search no further!

What could have been better: most of the staff was unusually unfriendly. When we arrived, we were \"greeted\" by a very crabby girl at the front desk who looked very annoyed that we had arrived. For our three days there, we did not have one friendly experience at the front desk, even when just asking a simple question. Most of the bartenders were equally unpleasant. During our stay, the only friendly staff was one waitress and housekeeping. The highly acclaimed restaurant, while good, seemed less professional than we would expect for the prices.

The front desk staff was also cooly professional and responsive to every request. A noisey A/C was replaced within an hour with a new and quiet unit !!! A deep tissue massage at the spa was satisfying. The small facility looks carefully planned but I was surprised there was no spontaneous invitation to partake of the steam room and outdoor shower, which I was offered once I inquired.

We did rent a car in San Juan and drove down to Guanica, through once we got there we never left the resort. The drive from San Juan was pretty straightforward and about 2.5 hours in duration (with traffic). There are several toll roads so bring a roll of quarters (the exact change lines are far shorter than the cashier lines).

We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel like the Ocean View option was a major plus over the Garden View rooms (given how close the beach is). The palm trees and flowers and the entire grounds are well-maintained and beautiful. We were also very pleased with the friendliness of the staff, from the wait staff in restaurants and bar to the water sports staff and the grounds crew. Almost everyone speaks English. All our requests were met promptly and with a smile. Copamarina serves a breakfast buffet from 8-11am, which never varied but was pretty good for resort faire. They had an omelet station, plus scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, fried potatoes, fruit, pancakes, and French toast. We never got tired of it in eight days. Lunch is from 11am-6pm, and the menu is a mix of sandwiches, burgers, salads, and dinner-type entrees like steak, fish, and chicken, all served in their outdoor bar/caf\u00c3\u00a9. Overall, we were quite happy with the variety and quality of the food and the service \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just enough variety for about a week. Many people got their food \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to go\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to either eat on the beach or their room or take it with them on a trip somewhere. Dinner was from 6-10:30pm or so, and was a white-table-cloth affair, though not necessarily that formal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c people were in everything from dresses to t-shirts and shorts. They had a nice selection of appetizers and about 12 entr\u00c3\u00a9e items, plus a daily fish or meat special. We tried just about everything on the menu, and the variety was also just about right for a week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stay. You had the choice of eating inside or outside, and outside they had an acoustic guitar player providing music nightly. We spent most of our time sitting in beach chairs reading books, and overall were very happy with the general layout. Southern-facing beaches often have little shade, but the Copamarina had enough palm trees, umbrellas, and thatched canopies so that we had no trouble staying out of the sun. They probably have about 40 beach chairs, and we only saw about 1/3 of them in use at any time. As others have written, the only downside to the beach is the water. The beach itself is quite nice (good clean, white sand) but from the edge of the water to about 100 feet offshore the water is only about 1 foot deep and there is quite a bit of silt on the bottom. If you walk more than about 20 feet into the water your feet sink several inches into the silt, so the immediate shoreline is too shallow and mucky for much recreation. However, the resort has a 100 foot dock, and off the dock the water is deep enough for swimming. The resort is in a protected cove, and in January (with prevailing winds from the east) there are only about 1 foot waves at most, so no chance for boogie boarding or playing in the waves. There were a few scattered patches of grass in the shallow water, but since we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spend any time there (and they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t visible from the beach) the grass didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t detract from the view. The shallow water and silt was definitely a detraction, but the rest of the resort made up for it. As far as watersports, Copamarina has two Hobie Cats, a bunch of kayaks, and some pedal-type watercraft. Given we had the all-inclusive package, we went out several times in the Hobie Cat and kayaks. No complaints there \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all the equipment was in great shape and the water staff were quite helpful. They also offer dive instruction and dive tours, but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do any of that. The resort has two swimming pool areas, each with a separate hot tub and kiddie pool. Instead of cooling off in the ocean, we took a dip in the pool or hot tub every few hours. The hot tub was quite nice in the early evening. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t beat the proximity from hotel room to beach (and thus a nearby bathroom and air conditioning) plus clean beach towels every day. We loved the all inclusive package, and felt it was a great value. We lost count of how many drinks we ordered from the bar and brought to the beach (during the afternoons the staff would make an occasional trip down the beach to take orders too), and we liked not having to look at prices and calculate tips. Since we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to wait for a bill or sign anything, meals and drinks were also more efficient. Our usual vacation strategy has been to eat one or two meals a day in restaurants, and then buy our own breakfast/sandwich stuff and drinks at a local grocery store and eat the rest of our meals on the beach or in our room. Based on our calculations the all inclusive package was pretty much equal to what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve paid in the past for hotel, meals, and drinks on other trips, and this time we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to hunt for provisions or throw away excess stuff when we returned home. Overall, the all inclusive package just made our lives easier. Again, we never left the resort once in eight days. The southwest part of the island is pretty sparse compared to the northern side, but we heard there were interesting museums and shopping areas in nearby Ponce. Other vacationers reported they did some hiking in the rain forest. There is also a ferry that runs from the Copamarina dock to a nearby island with a better beach and snorkeling opportunities (we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do that either). Overall, we loved our stay at Copamarina. Though we wish the water at the beach was deeper and the ocean floor was less mucky, the rest of the resort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s amenities, layout, service, and overall value more than made up for it. For those out there like us who just want to read books and vegetate for a week, Copamarina is a great place.", "Date": "January 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta,Georgia", "Title": "\u201cFriend....its the Best kept secret in Puerto Rico!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4344689", "Content": "If you have a family or its you and the love of your life.

The service staff is particularly warm and attentive. The beach is as others have said - somewhat muddy, somewhat with sea grass - but little wave action so it's good for children. 300 yards walk down the beach to the west is a very nice public beach with no grass (but still a little cloudy). We found beaches about 2 or 3 miles drive past the hotel (on 333) to the east. These beaches have more wave action and are clear of turbidity and grass. The road to the resort is nicely paved, with ample guardrails, and very curvy. Just go slow and stay on your side and there's no problem. All-inclusive includes kayaks (one and two man), 2 catarmerans, pedal boats and were readily available. We had a miscommunication with the hotel that could have turned out to be unpleasant but the hotel corrected everything and was most accomodating. Clearly the hotel is well run. Things go very smoothly. Gilligans Island trip was hardly worth it. Just a small shallow, sandy lagoon surrouded by mangroves. The locals seem to gather here. We left on the first boat back. Note: Beware of radar traps throughout Puerto Rico. We got a speeding ticket (65 in a 55 zone) just as the limit went from 65 to 55.

I will not repeat what others have said about the facility itself, swimming, etc.; there were no surprises.

The Copamarina is also a good base for exploring the entire SW coast of PR, from Ponce around to Mayaguez - each about an hour east or west, respectively. There are several other good PR and US natural reserves within that span, especially Cabo Rojo, Boqueron, and Laguna Cartagena. Because we took many day trips we did not stay on the all-inclusive and therefore the Alexandra restaurant was too pricey for a la carte every night. There are few dining options in Guanica proper but several good ones in Parguera, about 20-25 minutes west. The informal Las Palmas was a better value for breakfast and lunch. As far as day trips go, one word of warning. The Arecibo Observatory and Rio Camuy Caverns are not as accessible from Guanica as they might appear on a map. There are no good roads across the Cordillera, and Route 10 does not go straight through, despite what it says on several maps. Be prepared to spend some considerable time on narrow, winding mountain roads. (They make the 333 road into the Copamarina a piece of cake by comparison.) If you do go to Parguera do not bother with the trip to the Bahia Fosforescente. The lights are gradually going out and I feel sorry for the boat operators who are still trying to squeeze a living from this dwindling resource. But it's underwhelming, believe me.

Although our room was supossedly garden view we were upgraded to an ocean view room. It was very neat, not pretentious, but with all the basic needs. Tropical decoration, soap and shampoo dispensers in the shower, wireless internet and cool drinking cups that make a nice souvenir. I also loved the futons on the beach! The staff was very friendly and the secluded location was great for those wanting to relax and feel away from everything. It is also close enough to take a day trip to Ponce and a visit to La Parguera and the bioluminiscent bay. The hotel beach was not good but next to it was Ca\u00c3\u00b1a Gorda, a public beach great for swimming. Their kiosko had excellent local food (empanadillas) and cheap pi\u00c3\u00b1a coladas, wich made a nice lunch. The only cons of the hotel are the beach and the pricey restaurant.

The resort is beautiful with so lush gardens, a great ocean view and it is nestled in a scenic and nature filled area. If you are looking for some rest and relaxation or some advenuture this is the place for you. We found the English speaking staff so friendly and helpful. More than one time, they told us \"don't worry we will take care of it, you are on vacation\". It was music to our ears. We enjoyed their pools, beach, and activities such as the cave hike and kayak tour of Gilligan's Island. Just note, the other reviews are right, the beach on the property is not for swimming. You can walk less than 50yards to the public beach or drive 5 min past the resort to another beach. The gym was good and the massage at the Bioderm Spa a real treat. We opted for the all inclusive which worked out well. You have more than enough choices and options. The food is great.

The grounds are lush, the food was terrific, the rooms and the staff were very nice. A few tips: -- If you want to snorkel out on the reef, reserve as soon as you can. Spots on the boat filled up quickly the week we were there. -- Copamarina's beach is nice for relaxing in the sun and taking dips in the pools and saunas. If you wish to swim in the ocean, it's shallow and grassy. But not to worry. The lovely Cano Gorda public beach is right next door, a stroll of maybe 200 yards. It has a sandy bottom and lifeguards. -- The sandwich shop at Cano Gorda is great for a quick lunch. The sandwiches are just $2 or $3. The pina coladas are cheap. -- If you go to Gilligan's Island, there is a coral reef just off the island's western tip. As you walk off the dock, take a right (most people will be turning left), duck through the fence, and pick out a picnic-table shelter as close to the western edge as you can get. -- Gilligan's Island gets its nickname from the lagoon, which is actually a tidal stream moving through the mangroves. Going \"up river\" against the current is a bit of work, but your reward is a chance to snorkel as you float back down to the lagoon. Very relaxing. Lots of fun. -- The rooms were nice with fridge, safe and balconies or terraces. The TVs had English-language cable (CNN, ESPN, HBO, etc.) as well New York City local channels. -- The ocean is very clean because the resort is surrounded by the Guanica Dry Forest. It's a bizarre landscape, and beautiful in an austere sort of way. Lots of cacti. If you're a hiker, go on line and print out maps of the forest trails. Also, go to TerraServer and look at the aerial photos of the terrain. Hiking into the hills is a great time. Pack lots of water and then add an extra bottle. -- Had a good and reasonably priced meal at the restaurant at the main Gilligan's Island ferry dock (not the resort's dock). They also sell emplanadas, or meat pies, which make a nice lunch on the island. -- You need a rental car because Copamarina is miles from anywhere. Invest in a good road map and study it. We traveled all around the southwestern quarter of Puerto Rico and made discovery after discovery. Beautiful beaches. Lighthouses. Views that took your breath away. -- If you go to the bioluminescent bay, expect to be disappointed. It is nothing like the firefly-glitter in the final scene of Lord of the Flies (if you happened to see the old movie). But, we were there on a moonless night, and the boat trip under the stars was well worth the price. I don't know that I've ever seen more stars in a sky. -- Copamarina is on a narrow and torturous coastal road. (It is well paved with lines painted on the edges.) If you drive to the end of the road, there is a lovely but littered public beach. If you're a hiker, take the trail that follows the coast beyond the road's end. You'll be rewarded with dramatic views. There are not many places where you can walk for miles along the ocean and see no one else. Again, take lots of water. Also be forewarned: There were male prostitutes at the beach itself trolling for clients. -- If you get the craving, there's a Burger King in Guanica at the intersection to the highway leading to Copamarina. Come to think of it, there's a MacDonalds nearby, too. -- Copamarina is a place to unwind, relax, read books, play tennis. There is no nightlife. By 10 o'clock or so, the resort is asleep.

We all had a fantastic time and would go back in a heartbeat. We rented a car in San Juan and drove to the resort. I highly recommend having a rental car. It is a long drive to Guanica, but very pretty. The other drivers are crazy, so be prepared. It is easy to get lost in PR because the roads are not marked well. You are best to know what town you want to go to next. There are signs that direct you to a town so you will have to go by that. The resort never seemed crowded. Sometimes we had to wait a little bit for a table at breakfast, but only if we got there later in the morning. Go early and you are fine. You need to prepare for the slower pace. If you are used to BAM BAM BAM service, things are a little different. And this is not just at Copamarina. Even Burger King is slow. It is just the way it is, so relax about it and enjoy. You are supposed to be vacationing anyway. The boat ride out to Gulligan's Island was not running. GI is/was closed, but the boat captain will take you out to Playa Ballena instead. Very worth it. (You can drive to Ballena by going down 333 past the resort, but take the boat. It puts you way out at the point where it is not crowded.) You will find a Caribbean beach with no one on it if you walk out to the point and around. Go to the dive shop and they will radio the boat to come to the resort dock and pick you up. The countryside is rather depressing. A lot of run down homes and buildings and wandering mangy dogs. I was told by a local, \"why put a lot of effort into your house? Hurricane is going to come knock it down every few years anyway...\" But look past that, and you will find wonderful kind people who are very accomidating. We only ran into 4 people the entire week who did not speak any English. If you plan on driving around, get a guidebook that has some common Spanish-all the street signs are in Spanish. My husband thought there was this town named Salida which all roads seemed to lead to. I told him, NO, salida means \"exit\" silly! Our room was very nice. We did not do all inclusive, so we only ate in the fancypants resort rest. one night. Our meal was okay. For the four of us, the bill came to $130 (that is with 2 kids w/meals from the kids' menu). Someone else mentioned in a review to stay away from local food. I disagree! Do some research and understand what you are eating, and you will find it quite good. We discovered Pinchos, which are basically chicken or pork on a stick, grilled with BBQ or Hot sauce. LOVE THEM! There is a vendor that sells them on the waterfront walk in Guanica. $1 each. We ate our last night in PR for $6 the four of us. There is a very good pizza place in Guanica called cleverly, Guanica Pizza. Ask at the front desk. They have info. The pizza place will deliver to the resort. We paid $16 for two \"medium\" pizzas that would be called larges back in the States. We did day trips to El Yunque and Arecibo and Camuy. It is quite an effort to get anywhere on the island. Plan on a whole day, but it is worth it. A drive to La Paragua just west of Guanica (which is where the bioluminescent bay is) is a good evening trip. We did the boat ride, unfortunately on a full moon night, so the bay was not very good. But we paid $20 for the 4 of us to have a hour+ after dinner moonlight boat ride, and that was fantastic. There were oodles of other kids for our boys to play with. All Puerto Rican children seem to speak perfect English thanks to cable T.V. The resort staff had organized activites for kids every day, and the guy who led them was FANTASTIC! It is true the beach is not a crashing ocean beach. The resort is in a cove, and the bottom is silty with grass. Cana Gorda, a public beach is a 2 minute walk down the shore and is a great place for swimming, but even here, the waves are not huge. The waves break way offshore on the reefs, so leave your surfboard at home. There are vendors at Cana Gorda where you can get cheap eats and $1 Medalla beers. If you have a car, there is a dirt road off 333 that goes down a cliff on the right side heading back to the resort. There is a green gate. This leads down to Playa Jaboncillo. GO THERE! The road is a little rutty and steep, but we got our Scion down there and back up just fine. At the bottom there is a gorgeous cove beach with cliff sides and no one there. Also drive down past the resort and there are more beaches, but go on a weekday. The locals flock to the beaches, and the areas around them are worn down and sometimes a lot of trash. Very sad, but try not to think about it. (I live on the East Coast and have been to VA Beach and Ocean City MD, and there they have to sift the trash out of the sand every night! Can't stand those places!) The ONLY bad thing that happened was the snorkeling trip on the dive boat. For our last day, we had made a reservation to go out on the snorkeling trip at $45 a head. It just so happened that I stopped by the dive shop that morning and happened to overhear that there was a problem with the boat, and the trip for the day was canceled. I was a little put off that they had not contacted us and told us. I asked the people in the dive shop what was going on, and they were very evasive, like they were hiding something. Was the boat broken? Problem with the Coast Guard? No one would really say. (The Coast Guard was there for some reason.) I told them that I would like to know b/c it is our last day, and I did not want to waste it. It ended up that the trip was canceled, so we went to Playa Jaboncillo instead and had a wonderful last day after all. I would go back to Copamarina without a second thought. If you want to plop at the resort and not move, get the all inclusive. If you like to go travel and see things, have a car.

I stayed at the Copamarina in Guanica..this is the south area on the Carribean Sea...and it was a trip to remember. I went to Puerto Rico only because my friend and travel companion choose Puerto Rico...however I did some study and I choose the Copamarina Resort. I didn't know it then..but I had choosen heaven. But first let me tell you...don't let anyone lie to you about the travel time fron the Murin, San Juan airport.....IT IS A TWO HOUR DRIVE..and sometimes more. If you can afford to..or have kids or a larger group RENT A CAR. Where this location is...there is no public transportation and you will most likely want to go to other areas to sightsee.....however you can rent a car on the resort site..if you want to shuttle in first then rent a car. As a water nut..I was appeased..they have three pools..one for the kiddies a foot deep with a sprayer..and two full size pools. They are not super deep and thats a good thing because there are no life guards...you will feel comfortable having your older kids alone to the pool because they can't get into really deep water...someone will be able to help them out of the water if any problems occur..yet deep enough for an adult to swim in. Swimming at the beach is different..it has a lot of grass and vegetation..personally I'd move closer to the public area If you desire a sandy bottom for a better \"sea swimming\" experience. I wore swim shoes when I swam in the sea ..so the feel of the bottom was no problem for me at all. The grounds of the Copamarina are just plain beautiful...featuring all sorts of tropical plants and flowers that are a feast for the eyes......and your sight is then drawn to the sea...blue..blue waters. bobbing boats and off to the distance the breaking waves where the reefs are located. I cannot compliment the staff enough. Most of which not only speak english but are willing and able to help you in whatever way they can..within one day the breakfast men knew I wanted my coffee and served in right away(also I must add that the Puerto Rican coffee is amongst the best).Cost 20 dollars with tip. Beautiful buffet spread with omolets,french toast,sausage,bacon,fruit.oatmeal.muffins.waffles.scrambeled eggs..you'll want for nothing. Now..here's where some of you may have an issue.......the food is not cheap here and If you have a three or four member group you will either have to get the inclusive plan or have a car to travel many miles to fast food joints on Route 2. Unless you have a strong stomach DO NOT EAT THE LOCAL FOODS OFF THE RESORTS. I have tried several local places and the foods were not up to standards..........................but ....oh...the......Copamarina. One night I had a delicately fried and presented whole Red Snapper..w/ squash and other veggies(your choice) with 2 lovely glasses of Merlot(my choice instead of white) I still dream of that snapper..the bill 45-50 dollars without tip. The food was worth it..the presention itself well worth it.. and the staff is impeccable.. I had to almost pinch myself to be sure I wasn't in a high end casino eatery or a New York Restaurant.. because the staff was so highly trained ....excellent for me...but a big family or short funding will make it painful. The rooms are well appointed ..ours had a small refridgerator. ...no tub..but large tiled shower...issues here... large lovered ventilation grid right out to walkway...anyone passing can hear everything your doing in the bathroom.... we'd immediatly run water in sink upon entry....I believe this is only a problem on the second floors..because on the 1st foors it's palced higher up the wall..and you can't hear everything. Also a pass through door connecting the rooms sometimes allows for private conversation and sounds to be heard.But again the rooms themselves are really comfortable and nice. We even had a painting (probably local) of swimmers snorkling among the reefs-a great touch!!!! The pride of the Copamarina is the dive personel.......knowledgable people that have your safety and success in the forefront..and they know these waters.Well cared for FREE snorkling equipment...well cared for boats. Prime AAAAA dive experience here!!! Though the last few Hurricanes have damaged the reef these folks know who and what is still around to see and visit from striking Blue Tangs the size of dinner plates to starfish to all the other fishes you'd expect to see at salt water aquariums..only here they are wild and free ...moving around the coral for you to marvel at..and believe me I did just that!!!!! Its been a long time since I'd been snorkling. My friend that traveled with me is not a outdoor type...she longed for the bright lights and big city and fast foods THAT AREN'T HERE !!!!!!! BUT FOR ME............................................. I LOVE THE COPAMARINA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Thank God when we got to Guanica near our hotel, there were three police station, one fire station and I felt relieved. Everytime we drove around the next couple days we saw police cars one after another, some pulled tourist people giving them tickets for speeding, while we spotted residential (beat up cars) with badly cracked windshields driving without being stopped. People driving 25-75 miles an hour unlimited speed, they cut in front of you without signaling. Where's the highway patrolmans, I keep asking myself.

Back to the hotel the activity desk clerk would not let us have the trip to Gilligans Island, told us and everyone that it is closed for the whole week.

We all looked at each other feeling angry, lied to and cheated, and felt that if we all (hotel guests) would spend more money we can go its not true. We're just stuck, so we decided to go to the other not-so-famous beach the ferry goes every hour. This made the activity guy really angry!!! He gave me a hard time borrowing our hotel life jacket, snorkling gears, etc. Everyone on the boat felt angry too. We added all-inclusive to our over price room the 3rd day. We were informed by the reservationist that the plan includes foods, drinks, gratuities. My husband and I asked twice about the gratuities, just to make sure so we wouldn't look stupid. They said that the only people you tip are the bell-boy and the bartenders. We felt unjust so each time we got served we tip a few bucks or more. The next day back to the same restaurants they ignored us. So I said maybe their employers cheated them, why are they not jolly anymore. All-in-all this 7 day trip was boring and the people here are lazy, because the service was incredibly very slow. Breakfact is buffet style, but you had to stand and wait (5-10 min.) to get seated.

One thing to keep in mind (whichever type you are--I am somewhere in between): Even though there is an all-inclusive option, this is not a party-hearty environment. You get your meals, you get your drinks. However, the bar opens at about noon and closes around 10:30 or 11. One thing about that. Some said the drinks were kinda watered down.

Diving trip was great too - very well run and fun dives.", "Date": "February 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison, IN", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hideaway\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3008599", "Content": "Copamarina is a beautiful, quiet resort tucked between the desert hills of coastal PR and a calm bay in the Caribbean Sea. Our one bedroom suite had large rooms, an attractive tropical decor and views of the gardens and the sea. All of the facilities, beach and amenities were in excellent condition. This is a quiet resort in a remote area with limited nightlife but an extremely pleasant atmosphere and a great climate. A snorkel and/or diving excursion leaves from the resort daily. There are interesting sidetrips within a short drive. The resort is next to a national park with easy hikes and great views of the Caribbean. Public beaches (with waves) are on either side of the resort. Gilligan's island was closed during our stay, but would be an interesting spot to snorkel and swim. Nearby Parguera is a small tourist town with 3 or 4 restaurants, boat rentals and nightly cruises to a bioluminescent bay. Don't expect to spend much time in Guanica. We did not have the all inclusive package, and found the restaurant to be somewhat overpriced. The food was good, the service slow and amatuerish, but the kids were trying hard.

The rooms, the grounds and the staff are exceptional. The room is decorated in tropical colors, large beautiful bathroom, wooden shutters to the deck or patio, good a/c and an adequate television. The maid staff was efficient and the rooms cleaned daily (we tipped daily, and our room seem to be cleaned very well), the gardens, pool areas and beach seemed to always be clean without seeing lot of cleaning activity. The gardens and pool areas are very large and uncrowded. The resort has a lot of acreage for the small number of rooms (approx. 120 rooms). There was never a problem getting lounges at the pool or beach. Besides chairs and lounges on the beach there are also a number of large futons - yes futons on the beach. One is on a low wooden platform, the other two are on raised frames with drapes that you can pull closed all around for privacy, including a drape on top to protect from the sun. Great for a nap on the beach or more?? We did not take advantage of these. There is a dive shop/gift shop on the beach with dive and snorkel trips gear, towels. They also have kayaks, paddle boats and some other available watercraft. Everything up till the edge of the water is top shelf. The ocean water comes up short. It is very shallow, very grassy and kind of like clay bottom. So going to this resort to use the great beach would be a disappointment, but knowing this limitation leaves you options to either sit on the beach (great breezes and the sound of the water lapping on the sand) and swimming in the pool, while exploring the island for great beaches (of which we found many). There is also a public beach just a short walk away - it was a little better, not much. I did a little snorkeling on the far end of that beach. We were on the all inclusive in that we were on a timeshare exchange through RCI, which was mandatory all inclusive. The A/I includes all meals, beverages and 1 hour of non motorized boat daily. The Food: Breakfast was served begining at 7:00 and went to 11:00. While most people raved about the food, we are not quite as big of fans as others. First the positives; the staff was nice, friendly and a good resource to find things to do off of the resort. Breakfast was buffet on weekends, off the menu during the week. Fruit quality and selection was a bit of a disappointment. There was always plenty to eat, but in general we found the food to be very inconsistant. The salmon one night was great the next dried out. We found many of the entrees at Alexanders (the dinner, white tablecloth restaurant) dried out. Maybe it was just a temporary issue with help, but it wasn't a wow. With that said it is the only show in town, there are no other restaurants or night spots nearby. The prices at Alexanders were very high off the menu, making the all inclusive a deal. Although not thrilled with it it was fine and recommended. The desk staff was very helpful and friendly. Things we did - 1. walks in the dry forest, Take a left out of the resort at a green gate on the left side of the road is a nice easy walk through the dry forest, spectacular flora and fauna. Walk up to the 400 year old tree. Continue down this road - beautiful beaches. One day we took a drive to the main area of dry forest and took a short hike there. Lots of butterflies. 2- La Paguera - Bio Luminescent bay trip. 35 minutes from resort this $5.00 trip was a minor event, but fun non the less. Very few tourists on the boat, Cute fishing village worth checking out. We had a highlight when we ran into a parade heading right towrds us. We pulled over and watched as many tows people in marching bands, baton twirlers and dancers came marching by with the ever present speaker trucks blasting native music. What fun !!! 3- Long day trip seeking out beaches in Isabella, Aquadera (sp?) and Rincon. Found (with much persistance) Shacks Beach in Isabella !! Great Snorkelling !!. Continued down the road to find many other cool beaches. Not thrilled with Crashboat Beach, although it is written up many places as a top beach. Don't miss Rincon's beaches - good snorkeling on Tres Palms and watching the surfers on Dome's Beach was fun. Leaving Domes Beach on the right is a great little gift and t-shirt shop, fun proprietor and great shirts. Finding our way in and out of the towns and to the beaches was a challenge. Buy yourself a good road map before you go, and you still will need a good sense of direction and sense of humor. Coming back from Rincon we ended up going up and down over imposing mountains with two way streets only wide enough for one and a half cars. STAY RIGHT!!!! We ran into roads like these all over the island, with amny local drivers of trucks and cars alike driving on either side of the road. 4- We also, took in (on the recommendation of a waiter) a local Christmas light display in a neighborhood in Jancoa. Ask and find fun local things to do. The highlight of the trip was on our last day we got up at 5:30 to make the long 3hr drive to Fajardo and took a high speed catamaran to Culabra. We went with East Winds. Great fun trip on a cool boat to a reef for snorkeling in the most vibrant colorful and alive area I have ever seen under water. They then took us to Flamengo Beach, all I can say is PARADISE. Rated one of the top three beaches in all of the world on many services. They also fed us lunch, fruit and beverages including rum punches. Good people, great trip at a fair price. We had a greta time in Puerto Rico and just scratched the surface. We could go back multiple times and still find new things to do and explore.", "Date": "December 17, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut, USA.", "Title": "\u201cGreat for quiet family vacation\u201d", "Author": "FamilyGuy-CT", "ReviewID": "UR2885894", "Content": "We were at the Copamarina for five nights in the first week of December and had a great time. We are a family of 4 - two boys 5yr and 1yr. This was our first trip to Puerto Rico. On reaching puerto rico, we spent 3 nights in San Juan. In spite of being warned, we were surprised by the size of the urban sprawl. We were very happy to move to the quiet part of the island and spend 5 days at Copamarina. The resort is very nice. Grouds are well taken care of. The rooms are spacious and they either have a balcony or patio. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They started to decorate the place for christmas when we were there and it made the place look even nicer. The kids really enjoyed their time in the pool, the beach and the lawns. My 5yr old was not happy with the sea grass and made a big fuss about going into the water. Kids will probably only play on the sand or at the water's edge - not swim. Upside - water is very calm, like a small lake. The people at the dive shop were excellent. Very friendly. Happy to take care of any special needs. I just went for one short dive on the local reef ( about 2miles from resort ). Nice reef, wide variety of fish. From the dock, you can also take a boat to a beach ($5 round trip) which can only be reached by boat. It is white sand and next to a small mangrove islands. Great for snorkeling as the water visibility was excellent. The fact that we could do all this from a dock just steps from the room was a huge plus for us. The only problem we had was that the place lost electricity for a little bit on the last evening. The generators got most of the lights on. But, perhaps unrelated, the water stopped as well. We were told that this was due to a major problem at the water company and that 3-4 local towns were affected. The next morning, we still had no water. As we were checking out early, we got the staff (still friendly) to give us some water in the ice bucket to brush our teeth, etc. I guess something like this could happen anywhere. I wouldnt blame the hotel. But, if we had to suffer this for 1 or 2 days, I suppose I wouldnt be that generous. The resort also seemed less than half full. I think that made our experience that much more relaxed. but, we loved it and would certainly consider going back again.", "Date": "December 16, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cNice spot\u201d", "Author": "memcc", "ReviewID": "UR2755290", "Content": "The Copamarina is a 1.5 hour beautiful drive from the San Juan Airport. On your way, be on the lookout for the white monument to the puerto rican farmer - this is the only spot to pull over and photograph the beautiful valley that you will see all the way along route 2. If you miss it, it's a royal pain to turn around. The Copamarina has very nice grounds and a cute little dive shop and pier. We were there in early October, so still off-season. Almost all of the rooms are ocean view, so it was easy to be given one. The room had a very \"tropical cabana\" feel to it with rattan furniture and a tiled floor, wooden shutters onto the balcony - but it also was air conditioned, with running water (beautiful blue tiled full-length shower stall) and a large tv. Don't forget to ask for your safe key at the desk - there is a $25 deposit and if you forget you have to walk all the way back. Since we were there in the off-season there wasn't a lot going on. We took a taxi boat from the pier to a local beach that was a little clearer than the beach at the hotel (somewhat turbulent water and many grassy patches). That was $5 apiece round trip. We were hoping to go to Guilligan's Island but due to Hurricane Jeanne it was shut down completely. We drove in to Ponce. Do not do this without getting explicit directions to the tourist section/\"old town\". We never found it and had a disappointed dinner at a Taco Maker at a truck stop on the way back to the hotel. DO go into Parguera and charter a little motor boat to take you snorkelling. We did this for $25 an hour - a small boat with canopy and a \"captain\" all to ourselves - we recommend Johnny Boat - the 'captain' was very sweet and insisted on using up the full two hours that we paid for (after seeing many many jelly fish, though the snorkelling was great, we were ready to head in) - and took us to \"iguana island\" to see the \"wild\" iguanas which are accustomed to being fed by tourists. No problems with the hotel, aside from cleaning the pools at seemingly inopportune times, and poor signage regarding that fact so that we were covered in slimey drying chlorine before realizing what was wrong with the water...", "Date": "October 18, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Copamarina Beach Resort", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g736581-d148807-Reviews-Copamarina_Beach_Resort-Guanica_Puerto_Rico.html", "Price": "$150 - $257*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Rte 333 Km 6.5</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Ca&Atilde;&plusmn;a Gorda Beach</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Guanica</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">00653</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Puerto Rico</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "148807", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/fe/a4/fea4377275c24000467fb4f5d590264b6large.jpg"}}
