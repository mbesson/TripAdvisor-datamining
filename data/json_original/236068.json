The room was nice to stay in along with comfortable bed. The tram is literally right outside so you can hear it if you are a light sleeper. They did have a fan in the room; so that helped with drawning out the noise of the tram & outside noise. This place has several stairs to go up & down to get to the rooms & bottom floor. As for me being pregnant; it was nice exercise since I was getting enough of that around town, but I didnt enjoy it so much once I was 'trying' to make it back to my room huffying & puffing! LOL Staff was great; very nice & friendly! Breakfast was typical European style breakfast; juices, breads, cereal, cakes, hard boiled eggs, lunch meats, & Ooo they even made fresh scrambled eggs for you :) Which was very yummy & nice of them :) Only thing I disliked; was having to walk up & down so many steep stairs & with luggage! And we put on the outside of our door 'do not disturb' and someone still came in our room to change the sheets & clean & vaccum... WE honestly were not to happy about that... But we DID prepare just in case it was going to happen like it did :( I would recommend this place to anyone that would like to stay a night or two. There is parking right outside the building if your able to find a spot; 36 euro for 24 hour or they offer hourly rates as well... Easy walk to the tram 1/2 lock... only 2 lines to get on to get to & from downtown back to the hotel which made it easy to remember... line 16 & 24 :) Enjoy!", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cVery odd place\u201d", "Author": "Ruby2000", "ReviewID": "UR127824183", "Content": "This was quite an odd place to stay.

Our first room was in the basement (down 1 flight of stairs from reception) and was meant to be a twin, but on request they had pushed the beds together to make a 'double'. The room was pretty big and had plenty of spare pillows, blankets, etc, and a couple of chairs. The only thing I would criticise is that there was no mirror! There was one in the bathroom though, and the corridor. It was lovely and warm throughout the hotel. The shared bathroom was big and clean, with a good hot shower. Shower gel/soap were provided and there was a hairdryer, although I took my own so didn't use it. Our second room was room 8, which was up 3 flights of stairs - in hindsight I'm not sure how much of an upgrade it was, and at a guess I would say someone may have requested less stairs, haha. The room was smaller, as was the bathroom but obviously the bonus was that it was ensuite. We also had a little balcony which would be lovely in summer, and a proper double bed. Plenty of choice at breakfast - warm croissants and bread rolls, cereals, yoghurt, fruit juice, eggs, toast, jam/butter/chocolate spread, ham & cheese, fruit, packaged waffles, etc. The breakfast room (which doubles up as reception during the day) is quite small so you may have to wait a little bit for other people to leave. Transport links were good, there are about 4 different tram lines near by that will take you pretty much anywhere you need to go. Although we did manage to get off a stop too early on our way there the first time and ended up about half a mile in the wrong direction - luckily the weather was nice and we didn't have many bags! There are lots of little vouchers/discount cards hanging up in the reception hallway with museum offers on and some other leaflets inside. There is also a vending machine downstairs for any late night cravings... I booked via hotels.com.

I would say it is in the De Pijp area, very close to vondelpark, the rijksmuseum and concert hall. At first you might feel a bit out of the way but you will soon realise you are not too far from the centre and are in a good area in terms of restaurants and cafes. The outside of the hotel is very nice. There are 4 flights of stairs and we stayed on the top floor - the stairs are steep and curl round at the top so if you struggle with stairs either hope to stay on the first or second floor (there is no elevator). The interior is authentic and has a homely feel to it. It's warm too - we went in December and hoped it wouldn't be cold and the shower would have hot water. We weren't disappointed. The shower was always hot and rooms were warm. Our room was a standard double with a shared bathroom. The bedroom was clean, bright and a decent size and we had a sink in our room and a tv hich had BBC1 and BBC2, CNN and the disney channel in English. The shared bathroom consisted of two separate rooms - a toilet in one, and a shower next to it. Both were clean and smelt fresh. The toilet was small but I suppose there's not much need for it to be any bigger. The shower was similarly small but I wouldn't say it was cramped - there was enough space to shower comfortably and dry off afterwards. Breakfast was very good, I was impressed. It is served between 8am and 10am in the dining area on the ground floor. The hotel smells like fried eggs and coffee in the mornings which I thought was lovely. The breakfast consisted of the following: a selection of cheese and ham, croissants, pre-packaged waffles, crackers, a selection of breads, mini baguettes, toast, jams, chocolate spread, butter, cornflakes, granola cereal, sugar puffs cereal, fruit yoghurt, milk, cream, fruit salad, pears, apples, bananas, orange and apple juice, fresh ground coffee and hot water and a good selection of tea bags. I am a vegan and was concerned breakfast would be poor for me but I bought some separate soya milk to put on cereal and had plenty of jam on toast and fruit. When we arrived were greeted by a pleasant lady. She gave us information about the hotel and gave us a map. The staff are all very pleasant and English speaking - I'm sure I heard them speaking in Spanish and other languages too. To summarise - good location, nice hotel, nice staff, great breakfast.

The room was tidy and comfortable with a nice balcony. Breakfast was traditional Dutch hard rolls, meat, cheese, hard boiled eggs, tea and coffee and they offered to cook eggs to order. Hours for the breakfast were from 8:00-10:00. The stairs are very steep (traditional Amsterdam fashion) and there is no lift. People with limited walking capabilities should not choose this hotel.

I would simply caution that there is no bacon or sausages available. However, you can get eggs to order, a good selection of cold meats and fresh fruit. I would definitely recommend it. -There is a lovely, vibrant restaurant the manager recommends around the corner from the hotel which serves Dutch food and was good value for money. -The management was very helpful and arranged to have our baggage brought to our room which, when facing four flights of incredibly steep steps (as one does in Amsterdam) was much appreciated. -In addition I was ill when we arrived and management immediately offered to change our room to one on a lower floor in case I was not in a condition to climb the steps. -Management is very good with tips on what to see in Amsterdam and when as well as what is value for money. -The tv was a good size and functioning. -The hairdryer in the bathroom was effective. Some issues: -The stairs are steep which is a fact of life in Amsterdam and cannot be helped. Heed the hotel warning that if you are disabled, elderly or generally unable to climb such stairs, rather book a room on the first floor. -The bathroom was very small with only a shower but nicely appointed and clean. I would not recommend it for a larger person though. The only problem was that the shower curtain was ineffective and, if you were not terribly careful, the whole bathroom flooded when you showered leaving you standing in a puddle when you went to the toilet or brushed your teeth. Had it been winter I would have been very upset. The problem is easily remedied by creating a larger \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstep\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 between the shower and bathroom to hold back the water which I would recommend to the manager. -Another issue was that there was no towel rail and/or towel hooks which meant you had to hang your wet towels over the back of a chair or on a door handle. Again, easily remedied. -The bed was too soft and I kept rolling into the middle which did not always make for good rest - there was no base cover on the bed and the mattress base was visible.", "Date": "July 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham", "Title": "\u201cQuaint, clean and comfortable\u201d", "Author": "Rtay22", "ReviewID": "UR115157417", "Content": "When we eventually found the place - because we got super lost, and it being tucked away on a side street, locals don't know of the place, and it was difficult to find.

The receptionist offered to take our suitcases up but since he was busy checking in others, we just dragged them up the steps ourselves... (remember to pack light if you're coming here because those steps are deadly!). We got there in time for dinner and they suggested an Argentinian steakhouse a couple blocks away... oh my god... that was the most delicious steak I have ever eaten! I can't remember the name of it but I'm sure they'll tell you. We had breakfast in the breakfast room/lobby in the morning and while it wasn't fancy or anything, the service was nice and it got us going for the day. Maps of Amsterdam make it look so much larger than it actually is. We were able to walk into town and we were very close to Leidsplein and the museum district. I would recommend doing Mike's Bike Tours... great way to see Amsterdam and super fun!

We stayed in the Ground floor Apt in the Hotel , which I can only say made our stay in amsterdam much more memorable, The apt consists of a lounge with really comfy seating, Television with English Stations, Fireplace with imatation log fire,,electric organ for the musically minded, cd player, double doors thru to 2 single beds, dining area, desk, double wardrobes,, bookcase divides to the next set of 2 double beds and another fire, all was tastefully decorated, the heat was marvelleous, bathroom, shower, wash basin and toilet , snow white towels, excellent shower which also had a bath stool for disabled or infirm. Working kitchen was well equipped with pots, pans, full cooker, fridge freezer, toaster,coffee maker, microwave, iron, ironing board, all delph and cutlery, Back door led out to garden area, with patio table and chairs. The bed linen was spotless, the beds comfy, one would be hard pushed to find same any where else, I know we were impressed and would use the Hotel again no problem, Tram 150 metres from Door, Supermarket similiar distance, .So for anyone wishing a nice quiet relaxing hotel i would recommend The Washington, now bear in mind you are not in Dam Square, 10 mins on tram and buttons of fare gets you there. Peace and quiet after a days sightseeing and a relaxing place to come back to was well worth it. Now if you book the Apt, you have to clean the working kitchen and whatever you use, the maid does not clean up after you, not that I expected it. Maid does the rest.

My memories about it are almost 100% positive. I and my boyfriend were visiting Amsterdam in March. Hotel Washington was our second choise after Downtown Guesthouse. We had booked GH first but after I found HW on booking com we decided that this hotel will be better. And we didn't regret a lil' bit. Hotel owner and staff were very friendly, understanding and helpful. we booked rooms via website but I also called the hotel to get more info on some particular things we wished to be arranged and got all answers I needed. Communication via e-mails also was fast and polite. We also were satisfied with rooms we've got. Especially with my double room. My friend arrived to Amsterdam a few days earlier and booked a single room (very small one, even smaller than the one shown in the photo on this site). It had absolutely no extra space but a narrow walk next to bed and closet. Bathroom was also very small. But that wasn't a problem. All he needed was the place to sleep a couple nights till I arrived and we moved to the double room. Hotel has only 2 double rooms, both on 3rd floor. Most people find it the major flaw that there is no elevator and steps are so steep. Sure it's not the most convenient thing with suitcases but that's what old Amsterdam architecture is. So we expected to find this and were pretty ok with that. We got the blue double room (another, according to photos on hotel page, is pink) and I was really happy about that. The room was quite spacious with quine size bed in the middle. The bed was OK (not too hard or too soft) and we even found 2 extra pillows in the wall closet. 2 soft chairs, magazine table and desk with TV. Can't say if it worked well though since we had no time for TV :-) But we gladly used the vase we found there (for my roses). The large room window faced the inner yard and had the door to the balcony. Bathroom was a bit larger than the one in the single room but looked similar: toilet, sink with large mirror, shower. it had air conditioning/fan, hairdryer, toiletries for 2. I was missing the only 2 things- curtain for shower and where to hang towels. As far as cleanliness goes, we had no problems with room service. Everything was cleaned nicely each day (some time after breakfast while we were out in the city). Bedsheets and towels were clean and changed daily. Linen wasn't brand new but cleanliness is what matters most. I just wished material wasn't so rough (not good for sensitive skin)... One of main feature we had chosen this hotel were reviews mentioning it's clean. the second one was safety. And we truly experienced that on us. As I said, my friend arrived earlier, so he had time to get aquainted with a friendly owner of the hotel as well as with lobby guys. When I arrived it was too early to check in so guys let me put my luggage at my friend's and take it later when my room available. The owner wasn't there at that time and we met him only when we were leaving my friend's room after I checked in and took my suitcases from friend's room. Since the owner didn't see me checking in he didn't know who I am, so he told us they didn't allow guests' visits. Sure it was about guests from outside the hotel. He was ok about my it after we explained him I'm their own guest. Second safety related thing was a personal safe in each room. I should admit helpfulness of staff here. It was enough just mention that safe doesn't lock (someone forgot to reset the code after using it) and guys came, opened it with a key and taught me how to use it to avoid problems in the future. We were served with same kindness at breakfast too. They served boiled eggs as part of breakfast. We were asked if we want them boiled soft or hard, or medium. When medium was too soft for me the first morning I asked to boil it more next time and got it boiled the right way. So, I can say they really care for guest's needs in each smallest request. The breakfast itself wasn't something extraordinary but it gave a choice of cereals, yogurt, several kinds of meat, cheese, bread, jams and honey, tea, coffee. I wouldn't ask for anything more.. well, maybe for fresh fruit to go with cereals and yogurt :-). We brought our own fruit the other day. Well, what else? Location. We found it GREAT. Close to main museums and tram stops. Just a couple streets to one or other side from hotel. Noise? The hotel was full of guests but there was no noise out there. The only \"noise\" was a pleasant one- singing of birds heard from inner yard early in the morning. Sometimes we heard our neighbors laughing or talking while passing our door but nothing through the walls or from the street. Oh, and sure I need to mention the CAT. It wasn't getting on our way but I saw him in the lobby. Very friendly and cute. sure, people with allergies should be aware of that. I would definitely advice my friends to stay there. We got a fair deal for what we paid. If you're a budget traveler with no extreme needs for luxury it's the right place to stay. The only downside could be no Internet in the room. But they've got it in the lobby and kindly let use it. I'm sorry I can't add good photos representing hotel. All we made were personal ones. I'll add a few slightly edited ones (covering myself) Hope it's ok for this site.

We had booked a 3 person apartment - we were told it was on the 3rd floor. We were aware that the stairs in the hotel were steep - but honestly, nothing prepares you for them (see picture!) Going up them the first time was a nightmare, my legs were aching after the first set! We were expecting a bit of help with our luggage but we recieved none. The apartment itself was very big - with a balcony! Had no complaints about the room, maybe a little old fashioned and dated, but for what we paid we were happy. We were bitten in bed though - we belived the blankets they put on over the sheet were the cause of this! Fortunately it wasnt cold so we didnt really need the blankets! Our room was cleaned and tidied every day between 12 and 3, but we were generally out before then. When checking out, we tackled the stairs with our luggage and gave the key back to the owners. This was only the second time during our stay that we had contact with them! A word of warning - dont be fooled into buying your food and drink from the shop by the tram stop - they are so expensive and charge you for items you havent even bought!

I have been coming to Amsterdam (from USA) since 1997. I once heard about the Hotel Washington from Frommers. I took a chance and was pretty pleased for a long time. I got to know the owners there (Johann, John, Michael) just to name a few. I stayed there many times maybe taking two trips a year. I would stay there every time for a week usually, or at least for several nights. I just stayed there again after a two year absence and before I came back, when I made the reservations, I found out that the Washington had new owners. I called to make a reservation, but the receptionist told me that I had to so only from the internet. I even offered to send a fax, but he refused. Wonder what you do if you don't have internet access (like when your traveling)? When I got there I was sad to see all of the help that they use to work there, now gone. They kept up with the same deal and feel for what it was, but the people that worked there before, were really 30% of the stay. The way they would look out for you!! Making sure everything was ok with the room etc... The Breakfast are exactly the same that they were before. No problems there. But two things that I can say I was dissappointed with: One, how much money would it be for them to just get all new bedding?!! It;s too old. And now about the new owners, (Turkish) One is rather gruff, telling me 2 or 3 times in the same first meeting that it was under new management and basically \"things are different now\". No improvements, just banking on the past success and return businesn. The staff are either cold non helpful (he seemed like he had a bit of attitude.) and the other one's English was pretty bad! (My Dutch friend tried to make arrangements with him to call me a Taxi early in the morning and was not convinced that he new enough Dutch to know exactly when we said we needed the Taxi. I actually got up an extra hour earlier, just so I could pull my luggage out the main street and catch a cab in the case he didn't show up. Then lastly, when the cab did show up....it was one of the hotel manager's Turkish friends (still an Amsterdam cab) but the whole week I felt a little too handled. I think who ever owns the Hotel Washington now should invest a few Euros in new bedding, and get the guys downstairs to learn how to say, \"Good Morning\" with a smile and just be more pleasnt. I won't go back to HW, but there is a newer (clean) hotel just a few houses down the same street called the Hotel van Kasteelen. I think it's a little more money, but I've head good things about it.

We knew the hotel had changed ownership at the start of the year, and so we were somewhat unsure how that might affect our stay. I am happy to report that the hotel lived up to all of our expectations. Yes, the climb up the stairs is very steep, and perhaps the new owners are not as friendly as the old owners, but it is still an excellent hotel for the money. The main advantage the Hotel Washington has is its location, close to the museums, Vondel Park and the Albert Cuyp Street market. You can easily walk to all of these places; in fact we walked right down to Dam Square. If you are not into walking then there is a tram stop right around the corner. The other big advantage for the Hotel Washington is that it is on a very quiet street. There was virtually no street noise that we had to deal with at night, although there was some noise in the building one night from the hallway, and the room upstairs. However the management were aware of the problem the next morning, and it did not happen again. The apartment we had was great for the 3 of us as it gave our son his own private room. We also had a kitchen and a balcony to sit on outside if we wanted to.

Although it was farther away from the hub of activity around the Central Train Station and Dam Square, it was less than a 10-minute tram ride to this area. (To get to the hotel from Central Station or Dam Square, take either tram 16 or 24 and get off at the Ruysdaelstraat stop; the hotel is about a minute's walk farther--follow the tram tracks around the corner onto Johannes Vermeerstraat--you can see Hotel Washington from the corner of Johannes Vermeerstraat and Frans van Mierisstraat).

The breakfast was also adequate: coffee, tea, OJ, milk, choice of 3 cold cereals, fresh fruit (apples, oranges), toast with butter/jelly/peanut butter, and soft-boiled egg served in an egg cup with sliced cheese and salami. The only negative feedback I have regarding the hotel room is the odor of cigarette smoke. However, I realize that in a hotel as small as this that it would be difficult to designate rooms as non-smoking, although this would be the ideal. As is the case in most of the older homes in Amsterdam, the steps in the hotel are steep and narrow. A member of the hotel staff explained that due to restrictions by the Amsterdam historical society, it is not possible to alter the interior of the building so that a lift can be added. If you are able-bodied, you should have no trouble navigating the stairs, although it could be somewhat difficult with large or heavy luggage; the staff did offer to help us with our bags, but we declined and had no problem getting our bags (and ourselves!) up to the 3rd floor. Overall, I was very satisfied with the hotel. PS: If you like Indian food, there is an excellent Indian restaurant within a couple minutes' walk of the hotel, just past the Ruysdaelstraat tram stop on a street corner on the left-hand side of the street (I specify that it is on the corner because there is another Indian restaurant a few storefronts down on the same side of the street).

All they gave you was a boiled egg (which I don't eat), bread, and two slices of cheese and meat.

I have been to Amsterdam many times before, and have stayed in hotels ranging from five to two stars, so I speak from experience when I say this is certainly the best hotel of the lot. Firstly, the location just can't be beat. It's situated on a quiet street about two blocks from the Museumsplein in a non-touristy area. It was a short walk to the Leidsplein and right across the street from the tram. There's a lovely italian bistro right down the block with excellent food and an even better vibe. Now, the rooms... As you probably know, Amsterdam is not known for their enormous hotel rooms (unless you pay the big bucks, of course) so we were very pleasantly surprised at how big and comfortable our room was. King size bed, two big dressers, a chandelier, a large outside deck with a view of a courtyard, and a bathroom with a real shower (yes, it actually had a curtain!) All this for 65 euros a night! The only downside was that there is no elevator (it's a historic building) and dutch steps are like going up a ladder. But our host, Dennis (the new owner) helped us carry our heavy luggage up 3 flights of steps. The breakfast was good, nothing incredible, but it was included with the already low price, so I can't complain. The last reviewer did not stay in the actual hotel, so take it with a grain of salt. In my opinion, there is no better place to stay in Amsterdam, unless you want to plunk down 500 euros a night at the Amstel. I will definitely be back!", "Date": "February 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Fe, New Mexico", "Title": "\u201cJust OK\u201d", "Author": "perigee", "ReviewID": "UR4356062", "Content": "We just returned from a long weekend in Amsterdam and stayed at the Hotel Washington based on the fabulous Tripadvisor reviews. We rented a 2 BR apt. for Euro 200/night for 3 women. Our apartment, #23, was just OK. I guess threadbare would definitely be a good way to describe it, although it did seem clean. There was a odd number of doors leading to the apartment, one of which was a vinyl accordian-style door with a weak looking lock, which made us nervous about leaving our valuables, especially since the hotel has no safes available to its guests. There was a small kitchen and very small bathroom, which were functional. I have seen apartment rentals in Amsterdam on the web which looked much nicer, in the pictures anyway. The new owners seemed indifferent at best. I have been to Amsterdam many times on business, so our group didn't require any assistance with getting around, etc., but the couple of questions we had were met with unclear answers. One of our questions was about the Connexxion Shuttle service from the airport, a good deal and very convenient. The Hotel Washington is linked on their website, but evidently they have now lost their contract with the shuttle. I did not see the rooms in the actual hotel, since we stayed in an adjoining apartment, but our rooms were cleaned once in our 3-night stay.

Upon arriving at the Amsterdam airport, you will want to look for the blue Schiphol Hotel shuttles ----- These shuttles are the only economical way to get from the airport to your hotel. Check out the website for a picture of the shuttle, so you know what to look for when you walk out of the airport. When I arrived at Hotel Washington, I was warmly greeted by Rolf, who couldn't have been more genial and warm. He gave me the \"basics\" on gettting around the city and where things were located...even took the time to draw up a map for me on how to get to the local gym. ROOMS: I know some have mentioned the steep staircase leading to the rooms, but I am young and in good shape, so this really wasn't an issue for me. Even if your fat and out of shape, I still don't see it as a big issue. Anyway, my room was perfect. Comfortable bed, cable television. My room, which was specifically a single room, was smaller, but nice sized for one person. I know Rolf has much larger room available as well. My bathroom was clean, with all the hot water i needed. Located on a quiet street, so I slept soundly with no outside noise. FOOD: I am an American, and in my country, we value and cherish a big morning breakfast. Well, I couldn't have come to a better place for a great breakfast (which is included in your room rate). When I sleepily walked downstairs in the morning, I was shown to a table, where a full Thermas of coffee awaited me. I told them I liked scrambled eggs, and the proceeded to make me one of the best scrambled egg meals I have ever eaten. Complete with all kinds of toast, cheese and fruit. This was truly a breakfast cooked to order, right out of their kitchen. EXTRAS: This is more like a bed and breakfast, but I must add...in NO WAY was my privacy ever encroached upon. Staff was warm and unbelievably friendly, but never were overbearing or nosy. Also, this location is GREAT!! You are just a 10 minute walk from the heart of Amsterdam. The Red Light District, various gyms and coffee shops are only a walk away. And the street Hotel Washington is located on is one of most beautiful in Amsterdam. I will be back in 2 months for a longer stay, and wouldn't stay anywhere else than HOTEL WASHINGTON! If you have any questions, feel free to email me.

We had a bit of trouble finding the hotel at first, but mostly due to our own lack of direction. To save money we booked a top floor room with shared facilities, which, though it was not terrible, I would not recommend. As we were there in June, the weather was very warm and the temperature kept rising as you went up the stairs. Also the climb up those 4 flights of steep stairs was not a lot of fun! Our room was large and very clean and though we did not have our own ensuite, we did have a sink and mirror in the room. The room also had a large private balcony, which was great, but it meant that keeping the room cool was a bit more of a challenge (since there were no other windows). We kept the doors open at night, but there was a great deal of noise outside that kept us awake, especially in the early morning. I think it was from the construction at the Rijksmuseum nearby - including jackhammering and shouting. The breakfast downstairs was pretty good - an egg, lots of toast, fruit and cereal, as well as coffee and tea - and the staff was always extremely helpful and friendly. They recommended an indonesian restaurant nearby which was excellent and gave us some great advice about trams, attractions, etc. All in all our experience was very positive, and I believe that in a different room would have been even better. Next time in Amsterdam we will probably try to get a hotel room in a bit more of a central location (Leidseplein seemed to be where we always ended up), but I would recommend a stay in Hotel Washington to anyone looking for a budget-friendly hotel with excellent service in the museumplein.", "Date": "September 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cTop call!!\u201d", "Author": "RamblinHeart", "ReviewID": "UR3798800", "Content": "We booked our accomodation based solely on the Travel Advisor rating, and it did not disappoint!
