The hotel location is between Wan Chai MTR and Causeway Bay MTR so you could presumably go to either station and walk to the hotel if you're not carrying much luggage or get a cab. I had a room on the business floor which placed me above the traffic noise. My room was south facing which gave me a good view of Morrison Hill and some blocked glimpses of Happy Valley race course. Check-in and check-out was smooth and staff were helpful with any queries that you might have. The room was a bit worn but well kept as housekeeping was on the ball so I had no problems there. The wifi connection in the room was good and was also included in the price of the room for rooms on the business floor so this was a plus point for me. Breakfast was also decent but you could reasonably do without it as there is a great selection of eating places in the neighbourhood which will enable you to try the local cusine as well. The central location is the great thing about staying here as the entire Causeway Bay shopping district is within walking distance as well as the Wanchai nightlife. Plus, with close proximity to Star Ferry and the MTR, you can presumably get anywhere within half an hour.", "Date": "August 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cPricey hotel\u201d", "Author": "missazza", "ReviewID": "UR138038188", "Content": "I booked a room on the business floor which is about SG$900 (yeah, its pricey) for 5nights. Its about 5-10mins walk from Causeway Bay MTR, very convenient but we took a cab from Hong Kong station to avoid the hassle of dragging our luggage from the MTR. There's a few convenient stores around the corner like 7-11, Circle k. Hotel is old, interior is old, heck everything is old. Check-in was a breeze, it took about 10mins. Our room number was 2012 which has the most magnificent view, especially at night. The room is clean, bed is very comfortable but the pillows are too soft & flat, had a neckache everytime i sleep on it. The room was equipped with a electric kettle, compliemtary coffee/tea, mini bar, free wifi, flat screen TV, a table & chair which is a plus to apply my makeup. The room is really small, there is no hairdryer, complimentry bottled drink (mineral water), have to login again & again to use the wifi (other hotels is auto-login/recognised), TV program have limited english channel. Hotel & room decor is very old & outdated, its about time for a renovation. One of our relatives stayed in the same hotel, they stayed on the 10th floor (not business floor) which had the exact same amenities. Hence, we only paid extra for having a magnificent view. The hotel staff are friendly but sometimes i felt that they kinda hesitant if they should approach me (Us) or not, maybe because i don't look rich enough? (LOL) . Overall, its a good hotel but its too pricey. The only reason i booked this hotel as its just a few mins walk to The Muslim Canteen. Basically, its due to convenient sake to have a guaranteed halal breakfast every day. There's also a middle eastern restaurant across the st & halal pizza joint down the st as well. Would i stay in this hotel again? Nope. No doubt, its very convenient but i can get the exact same thing or better in another hotel & save a few hundred bucks at the same time.", "Date": "August 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dhaka", "Title": "\u201cLocation vs Service\u201d", "Author": "Baul_37", "ReviewID": "UR135536261", "Content": "A 6-day stay has mixed experience.

The location in Causeway Bay is fabulous - minutes from Times Square for shopping, lots of different restaurants nearby, local convenience stores and easy access to the MTR. The staff we encountered, Oliver, Carol and the Head Concierge, Provis, were all incredibly accommodating and our room attendant was both polite and respectful. We had some particularly challenging requests in obtaining visas for mainland China. Provis made every effort possible to make this happen, not only on a Sunday, but on a public holiday weekend too. I take my proverbial hat off to him. The S floor rooms are all newly renovated and have comfortable queen sized beds, a flat screen TV, fast efficient wi-fi and bijous little bathrooms. Space has always been at a premium in Hong Kong, and to have everything you need is a great thing indeed. We are from England origianlly but live in Bangkok, and have a lot of trouble getting a good nights sleep with humidity and heat. Not so here, we both slept like babies... ! The bathroom has a super big wet room shower with rain shower, regular shower and body jets, a good way to wake up. The workspace is ergonomically well designed and the desk chair is suitable for sitting for a period of time. Hanging space is sufficient and there's even a luggage rack and drawer for extra items and shoes. Breakfast was included in our rate and we thoroughly enjoyed a basic breakfast with freshly cooked eggs, crisp tasty bacon and fresh bread. All in all, I think this is a great place to stay, good value and the perfect spot from which to voyage out into Hong Kong, whether you are on business or travelling for pleasure.

The furniture is beat up. The beds are worn. The rooms are tiny. The view from my side of the building sucked. The bathroom is in a desperate need of restoration. This is the only hotel in HK/China/Taiwan I ever stayed in in any price category that had no toothpaste and a brush in the bathroom. The breakfast ($19) was so mediocre, I already forgot it. Under any other circumstances I would not ever stay here again. But! The Star Ferry pier is 10 minutes walk away. Same with the Convention Center. Same with MTR. 5 minutes to a tram or a bus. Free internet (wired). And all of this for a very, very reasonable price (under USD100 in my case) when everything else around runs at least for twice as much. So if you are on a budget and need a decent location close to the infrastructure, or could care less where are you are asleep after a long day of tourism, this is a good value choice. BTW, the hotel does not provide the adapters from HK to the US or Euro chargers. There is a packed adapter in the room, but if you open the package a HK $90 (US $12) charge will appear on your bill.

However upon eating we discovered that an additional HKD 99 per head was charged. A little misunderstanding since we dont speak cantonese. although more people in HK speak english than other parts of China, knowing a few phrases in cantonese would immensely help. The staff however were friendly accomodating. We usually asked them to write down the names of our destinations in chinese so we could show them to the cab driver. The rooms though small and a little dated were clean with a tub in the bathroom. However my parent's room although designated non-smoking reeked of smoke so they asked to be transferred.

The nearest MTR station at times square building is about a 5-10 minute walk through a wet market which was filled with live and fresh seafood and fruits. It was our first time to stay at the hong kong side of hong kong and although we missed familiar shops at the kowloon side, we found this area to be newer, with more tourists and more exensive shops. But this is just my opinion. So we scheduled a day to visit tung chung before we leave for hopefully cheaper shopping :). We ate lunch at the famous crystal jade restaurant at 3pm at IFC mall and found it packed. The xiao long bao, a pork dumpling eaten with red vinegar and ginger is definitly a must try. Water is not usually served in restaurants especially along the street so unless you bring you own, be prepared for the staple hot water or tea. I learned that \"mixed meat\" dish actually consists of innards, seafood, sausages and tofu... but actually quite tasty. So for the less adventurous gourmands, stick with chicken or beef :) or try mcdonalds which i learned serves soup and red bean pie too for dessert. February is a wonderful time to visit since the weather is still cool which is my excuse to don my leather jacket and boots, a treat for someone who lives in the tropics! As for the charterhouse, try it out but keep my advice in mind :) and try to get a mountain view room for a better experience.

Making a choice of Hotel in Hong Kong is quite tough as the Price vs. Size ratio is a bit crazy! That being said The Charterhouse is very good value compared to those around it. Check In: We arrived late in the evening (9:00pm) so had no delay or waiting time for check-in. Only problem was that the lady who served us told us our room rate included Breakfast each morning, however next morning when we arrive at the Breakfast they said \"no it does not, and we wouldn't have said it does\" - I wasn't in the mood to get into an argument so just walked out and found breakfast at one of the many bakeries nearby. Bit sad to start a 7 night stay with that king of situation. Room: We were in a fairly high room, I can't remember the exact number but we were on the 2nd top floor so had a nice view out towards the Happy Valley Racecourse. Ok I don't think anyone can go into HK thinking that the cheap rooms are going to give you a massive spacious area! That said there was \"enough\" space for us, we had 2 suitcases + 2 carry on bags and it was a bit tight. Bed: Was comfortable enough, pillows could do with being replaced I think they are getting a bit old Fittings: It looks like the room has been modernised lately because most of the switches and controls didn't work, and you kind of had to play a guessing game each night to work out which switch turned off the lights. TV Reception was appalling, would bounce between terrible and shocking - I think in 7 days we had maybe 30minutes of actual clear TV reception, but I can look past that. Bathroom: Not as tiny as I expected but still pretty small, shower and bath combined, the water was a bit of a guessing game, bounced between cold and scalding. Location: Well that is the saviour for this hotel, it is smack bang between Wanchai and Causeway Bay MRT station, little bit of a walk the hotel say 5-10minutes, I would suggest this is at 2am in the morning because every day it took us about 20 minutes fighting the foot traffic. Lots of Restaurants nearby to get some good food - new little Turkish joint across the road did some very good food (cheap). The other benefit about the location is that most Taxi Drivers know it and the road it is on, our friends stayed at a different hotel and had lots of trouble trying to explain where their hotel was. We just jumped in and they knew the hotel. Overall: Look there are a few areas where the hotel desperately needs to update which did drag down my impression a little bit. Overall staff were kind of attentive to our needs (apart from the first mix up on checkin).

You can walk to C-Bay in mins, Central (if you want a slightly longer walk), and even Soho if you are really in a walking mood. You can also catch buses like the 11 (to Central Piers) or the 111 (to Macau ferries) right outside the door.

An overdue review : Actual trip February 2009. This review goes hand-in-hand with the one just submitted for Regal Riverside, Shatin. And for the record, I'll also do one last one for Stanford Hotel in Mongkok because I stayed at all 3 hotels for that one trip in February 2009. This was the 3rd hotel which I stayed (2nd was Stanford) for my trip in February 2009. Part of this splitting up was so that I could sample as many hotels as I can. The hotel itself is not very visible from the main road but taxi drivers are aware. Reasonable sized (not large) foyer, bright and welcoming with small area with seats for guests . A quick check-in and I was shown to my room down a rather narrow corridor. Although I like having rooms near staircases (less noise disturbances from traffic coming from lifts), this was disappointing. My room was very small with a single bed (set up next to the wall so you can only sit on one side). Writing desk (parallel to the bed with probably 3feet space between), corner cabinet with tea/coffee facilities and a little tv on the top shelf. I queried at front desk regarding the size of the room and was told quite frankly that this is what ALL standard room are supposed to be. What the......??? I have to leave my luggage on the floor and side-step each time I go to the bed. Bathroom and toilet are combined. Just sufficient room to do a 360degree turnaround. Airconditioning was ok but what really upset me was the smell of cigarettes on bedsheets . I wasn't happy about it because I did specify non-smoking when I booked on the internet. The whiff of cigarettes was quite noticeable as I entered the room and I thought it should dissipate by the evening and it did but little did I realise that by the time I went to bed, the bedcover (or quilt) still has it. I rang room service to complain but nothing was done about it. I DEFINITELY AND DID SPECIFY THIS ON MY FEEDBACK FORM TO THE HOTEL when I checked out. Apart from that, I didn't bother trying any of their inhouse restaurants, bar or coffee shop when there're plenty down the road at Times Square. The on-duty concierge was friendly though and the housekeeping lady was helpful as well. Location wise, this is actually quite good cause 10minute walk brings you to Times Square and MTR in the basement. . On the way you'll discover 2 lanes of open-air stalls selling fresh fruits, veges, meats and seafood. Popular with locals living around there and I like this sort of exposure..

This was a New Years celebration for us. Right, now back to the hotel. It was not one of the bigger hotels but fair in size. For the most part it was clean in general. However, certain other aspects were not appealing. For instance, my wife and I are not smokers and we know very well in Hong Kong there are many smokers. Actually, I'm being kind because there are more than many, for some reason I keep on thinking of that Mcdonald's board back in the USA where they keep their running stats outside that says over a billion served. Anyhow, we paid in advance and made sure to request a no smoking room and we even double checked to make sure they had it before we came. When we arrived they took us to our room after check in and you guessed it, was a smoking room. The second we walked in it reeked. So, we politely asked that they change our rooms. At first they told us there where no more but they knew we were not going to settle for less than what we asked for especially since my wife having the nose of a Basit hound, did I spell that write. Anyhow, not a nose that looks like one but she can sense like one no joke. Bottom, line we went to another room and it was actually a queen size bed not a king size as request so they had no choice but to give us an upgrade and this time instead of walking us there they simply gave us the key as if we were trouble or high maintenance guests. So, much for the love on that note. Also, i'm a fairly big guy or pleasantly plump as I like to say. I'm working on the weight now but I am good looking at least. Hope i wasn't arrogant there but anyways the bed was too small but I dealt with it and no complaints on my part as their prices where fair on the per night basis. So, the The second problem was that even though I wanted to watch a movie late at night not porn because they offer that every where in Hong kong in any hotel movie system but the movie would not function and although they agreed to take it out the bill they still charged it to our credit card after we left including charging us for extra nights on our room. So, we had to go through the process of dealing with our Credit Card company in order to have them revert funds this took time and effort out of my wifes time in order to call them and inform including the hotel. Well, we got the cash back but not happy about the cheap shot as the counter guy in the lobby seemed to not be happy about this as we had initially made them delete the charge before we left only to find out they had added it again. Anyhow, they were semi efficient in servicing the guests but left something to desire for a second visit. My visiting them again would only be again if I had limited funds to part with. Anyhow, there you have it. I see this place overall as a choice for first night arrival while you try to find the best hotel for your selves. The pluses on this hotel to be fair is the price as I said is fair, WiFi available free but only in the lobby, movies and restaurants within 10 to 15 minutes walking and not to far from the tram station to Airport.

Out of my surprise, the restaurant provided wide variey of choices in food, from sushi, long clawed crabs, Hainan chicken rice, Cantonese dim sums to curry food. All the staff I met were friendly and courteous.

It's in between Wan Chai and Causeway Bay, and within walking distance (10 minutes) of both MTR stations. Convenience stores and eating places abound, so food is never a problem. The problems are the rooms, and small minds. Room first. We are in a signature room. The room is beautifully styled and decorated with clean, modern lines. Every technological convenience for the road warrior is made available. There is even a Krups coffee maker if you should be inclined to brew your own while on holiday. The bathroom is a good size with a wonderful rain shower. Amenities from Giorgio Armani complete the look. All the signature rooms are on the second level, you get traffic noise all the time, day and night. Walls are wafer thin. You can hear the lift go 'ping!', you can hear people walking and talking outside. And it could be part of the style, but the windows are covered by shutters that do not adjust and do not keep out night light. They also do not allow day light in as the glass is completely covered by yellow plastic. It's a weird feeling not to be able to look out and check the weather in the morning. My biggest problem is with the staff. There is a distinct difference in attitude towards the way the staff - even the porters - treated the guests. Asian ones are usually ignored and not offered any help. When we arrived at the hotel for the first time, the suited doorman simply stood and stared as I tried to haul our luggage up the front steps, while carrying my younger child in my arms. This morning, my husband was even stopped from taking a newspaper (one of the complimentary ones) to read at breakfast! While waiting for my husband at the lobby, I gave my 2 and 4 year old children biscuits to eat. One of the concierges/managers (a man in a suit) came and told me, in Mandarin, that they were not allowed to eat in the lobby. Is there ever such a rule in any hotel? We were seated quietly at a corner, not causing any disturbance.

The room is petty small, however, unlike other hotels I stayed before, it didn't give me pressure. I think it is because the staff put some efforts on the details in the room. For example, there are tourism coupons in the tourism brochure on the desk. And there is a map of Hong Kong in the drawer too. The only disavantage I think is the internet fee, which is rather high. They have 3 packpages: 30 HKD/30 mins, 120 HKD/24 hours, and 240 HKD/48 hours. Even if we choose the 24 hour one, which can be considered as 5 HKD/hour, however, people won't come to HK and stay in the hotel room just for surfing online for 24 hours!

My other room i booked had a leaking air conditioner which dripped onto the carpet causing a smell and damp/wetness. The bathrooms were basic and old which is not a problem but the black mould living on the mastik all around the sink basin was off putting, towels pretty old with worn marks but clean, but the cherry on the cake was i didn't use the mini bar, i never do, i booked out, no charges, nothing used but got home to find i'd been charged for (on checking with my booking agent) 2 bottles of whisky, i absolutely disputed this and to date have heard nothing, i think giving a month is long enough to prove that they accidentally made an 'error' so i would warn others to check their credit cards and if you don't use a minibar ask for it to be cleared thus not giving them the opportunity to 'boost profits' i'm not out of pocket by a huge amount of money, but i could have been!

The S floor is on the 2nd floor, so you can hear street noise, but in general we didn't find this a problem. they give 2 bottles of complimentary water a day, paper, and fresh fruit on arrival. On the S floor there is also a business centre room where you can use the internet for free. It also has a shower room and toilet which we were able to use whilst waiting for our next flight having already checked out. their fitness centre is small, but has 2 treadmills, 2 cycles, and weight machines. to use the gym, we had to go up the staircase and caught a glimpse of the other floors, which did look a bit dated. hence we are very glad that we upgraded our room to the S floor, as we had no complaints with it, and it is quite cheap for a boutique room in city centre, we know that we wouldn't get that for the same price back home. breakfast was good in that there is something for everyone, i read an earlier review saying that there wasn't cheese available but think cheese for breakfast is not a common thing in hong kong unless you are staying at a huge international hotel. Downstairs we used the champs bar, it was a good place for a drink for the end of the day. Beware the Chelsea fans when they take over the place when chelsea games are shown! lots of footie on - even if recorded games. The location of the hotel is very convienient, once you know where you are going, it's about a 5 minute walk through the wet market to the shops and MTR - causeway bay has the most choice of places to eat and drink in the one area.

Have been to HK before so the focus was on eating and shopping this time! The rooms were small but clean and well-arranged. I was only staying one night but I would have been happy to stay for longer. There's lots to do in HK so no need to be in the hotel too much anyway! The beds were quite short - I'm 5ft2 and my feet were over the end ! unless I pushed the pillows right to the headboard - but I think that is standard in Asia. Service was friendly and polite. I was on the 18th floor at the front of the building and there was some street noise, not too much but might be more of a problem on lower floors. For first-time visitors to HK, staying somewhere in Central might be more convenient, but for shopping Causeway Bay is fine. The hotel is a few minutes walk to all the big department stores and close to the MTR. I found the map on the hotel website to be a little confusing and it took me 20 minutes wandering around to find the hotel the first time (I was having grumpy thoughts about the hotel website saying it was 7 minutes walk!) But actually it is really close and I think only took about 5 minutes once I knew the way. Here are my instructions in case they help: - Go to Causeway Bay MTR, take the Times Square exit, and go to the main entrance to Times Square where the big TV screen is. - With Times Square behind you, go left along the street. At the end of the street you will see motorway ramps crossing in front of you. - The street you want is straight ahead, but to cross the motorways you need to go a little to the right (there always seemed to be lots of people doing this, so just follow everyone else). - On the other side, there is a small street continuing ahead, it should be almost directly in front of you. There were stalls selling fruit and fish on both sides when I was there. - Continue along the small street for about 2 small blocks and you will come to a main street with trams crossing in front of you. - Wan Chai Street is straight ahead across the street and the Charterhouse is on the left, about the third building along.", "Date": "December 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "kent", "Title": "\u201cGood location poor room\u201d", "Author": "gingademon", "ReviewID": "UR11376432", "Content": "We recently spent four nights at the Charterhouse.

The plus points are its location, being close to Causeway, Wan Chai and Times Square shopping centre. I also found the staff to be polite and helpful. Another plus was the breakfasts, these consisted of a wide choice of western and Chinese dishes, all well presented and of good quality. The bar downstairs was a good place for a drink after a hectic day and also provided good and relatively cheap meals. The big minus point was the room. It was drab and well past its best. The bathroom had mould around the tiny bath, the sink was cracked and worse of all the ceiling dripped water on us. The blankets on the bed were stained as was the wallpaper. Cobwebs were hanging off the ceiling. I did go straight back down to reception and requested another room only to be told that their was no chance as the hotel was fully booked for the next few days.

In-room food counter for your coffee/tea, replenished daily, and fridge for your water, fruits, etc. Very clean, and the maid service was exceptional. Good office space, and a wall to wall sofa for relaxing. There are no shelves or counters, so I kept having to shove items on the very narrow living area shelf.
