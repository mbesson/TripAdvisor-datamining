The breakfast was nice, not super large buffet as in Northern Europe, but definitely enough to get you started. I think on Sunday it was slightly smaller than on other days. Maybe they did not get full variety on Sunday from the bakery? The front desk was always friendly and helpful. What we loved the most, was the close proximity to Plaza Catalunia, only 1/2 a block away. It was great location as we spent the days walking around to see the sights, shopping etc. With the baby stroller, we did not try the underground, but instead used the taxi for longer journeys.

So if you go to the bathroom in the middle of the night and have to wash your hands, you have to stand next to the bed and wake up everyone as you run water. 5) Airconditioning did not work.

It did not work, had to sleep with the window open which did not have any screen so there were some insects that got inside. 6) Rooms close together so when the couple with the crying kids checked out at 5 AM, we heard *every* *single* *word* they spoke as they were leaving.

(If you are offerred this move for the same price, please take it). We booked hotel Denit during a busy convention week in Barcelona and the price for an Economy Plus room was an outrageous 189 EUR per night, but it was the \"best\" deal we could find nevertheless. Anyway, when we showed up, we were given what appeared to be an Economy room which was more like a \"match box\". We were a couple and there was no way we could stay in that room for 4 nights, there wasn't enough room to even lay our two suitcases down on the floor. The hotel is nice and clean, and location is terrific but that room was so tiny. (When you sit on the toilet, the bed would be less than 5 feet directly in front of you with no door separating!) Also the tiny lane in front of the hotel had a bad sewage / urine smell, so bad that we had to hold our breath walking down that lane. Anyway, I complained to the front desk that it was not the room type I had booked. Kudos to the lady at the front desk on that day, she acknowledged it, and offered to move us to Hotel Majestic (see my separate review) for the first 2 nights until the room type we had booked became available. I hesitated at first because Hotel Majestic location is about 10-15 mins walk away from Plaza Catalunya, but I could not stay in the match box and did not want to unpack/pack. I checked out Majestic Hotel online, and after being assured that it would be a better choice, I asked if we could stay at the MH for the entire 4-day stay. It was our luck that there was a room available so they paid for a taxi to take us to our upgraded hotel. While I appreciate what Hotel Denit has done in this situation, we would have had a miserable time at Hotel Denit if we didn't speak up. They need to somehow work with their neighbors or the city on that horrible smell on the tiny lane their hotel is situated. When booking hotel Denit, as a single you might be okay.

They were helpful and gave us good restaurant recommendations as well. Cons: - You'll probably read this a lot but their most basic room called the Economy (single/double) room is pretty small.

All in all, we really liked the hotel. The breakfast was decent enough that we ate here almost everyday before heading out. It was simple - breads, muffins, cereals, fruits, croissants, coffee - nothing too fancy but definitely sufficient. We were able to upgrade our room to the Economy Plus room once there was availability which was way better in terms of space. The design is modern and funky - we liked that the sink was within the closet - something unique and different. The location was perfect as well and if you do stay here (which I recommend), try taking the Economy Plus room - the cost difference isn't much.

We were staying at the third floor of the hotel and it was very quiet, although located a 2-min walk from las ramblas, plaza catalanya, and the shopping street. It is very close to metro stops, buses to the airport (do not try getting to the hotel from the airport by metro, choose aerobus).

The Hotel Denit was a great find on Tripadvisor for us - and the location is perfect for airport transfers, exploring - close to lots of shopping, restaurants, bars and of course La Rambla - where it all happens!! It is located in a very quiet side street. On checking in the guy on reception was very friendly, efficient and eager to assist with directions etc. All of the staff at reception spoke very good English. He spoke to our airport transfer company in Spanish to ensure we had the right pickup location. Daily we asked for an ice bucket so we could chill our beers after a long hot day out! He even kept our cheeses in the fridge for us! Nothing seemed to be a problem! There is a PC available also for those who wish to check emails or book tours or whatever. Our room (57) faced the street frontage and we found it pretty quiet. Ultra modern, trendy and extremely clean! The IPod Dock was a great touch, a fantastic \"rain shower\" and our king size bed was very comfy too. Breakfast is pretty basic, bread, muffins, croissants, fruit, cereals tea and a Larazzo coffee machine. Enough to set you up till lunch time!! In summary this is a great hotel - value for money - and would recommend it as a good quality 3 star hotel! Just a tip when out exploring and eating at restaurants - Barcelona has lots of pick pockets and beggars so be very careful with your belongings and don't leave your mobile phone (or cameras) on the table. A family member that we were travelling with had her IPhone stolen off their table by a person who came to them begging for money.....these guys are professionals and before you know it - it was gone!! Just be vigilant.

After staying for such long time I could experience the good and bad sides of living in Denit. I especially liked the excellent location of the hotel, near the Catalunya square (which is a tourist center of Barcelona). This location provides excellent means of communication, both metro and buses are very near. In fact, most important places are so close, that you may even want reach them on foot, which is exactly what I did. Hotel staff was friendly and helpful, not much to say here because I was satisfied. The room was clean, bright and very nice. Both walls and windows were soundproofed adequately - it was not possible to hear anything from the street or other rooms in the hotel. However the door was not soundproofed at all, which is irritating when people were walking or talking in the corridor at night. In my opinion the bathroom needs some serious changes. For example: the shower lacked the door. It resulted in water splashing all over the bathroom when shower was used. Also, there was no handle in the shower, which made washing feet a bit more difficult. For some unknown reason, the sink was located not in the bathroom, but in the room, near door to the bathroom. Considering the fact that bathroom was flooded every time shower was used, installing the sink in a room was not a bad decision. I liked the fact that bathroom was thoroughly cleaned every day. The breakfast was served on an underground floor, in a buffet-style way, and I have to admit that it was quite tasty. However, there was very little change in menu during my stay. Most of the served food types were served every day, so for 9 days I was eating the same kind of ham and cheese. Which got a little bland after a few days. The only kind of available vegetable was a tomato. Fruits were changed almost every day. The hotel advertises having a free internet in each room. I would not exactly call it free. The service is provided by Kubi Wireless, which seems to be a popular Spanish Wi-Fi company. The catch is that for free you're only getting access to web pages (using http protocol). That means you can access google, facebook, or any other web site. However, if you try to access your e-mail from software like Apple Mail, Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, or try to use VPN to connect to your work, or try to use SSH client, etc., then you're out of luck. Login page explains that you need to buy \"premium\" service to get full access to the internet! One of the most important factors for me was the price. Definitely, Denit's price is unbeatable in this part of Barcelona. I doubt you could find better quality for similar price. Some of my problems were probably related to the fact, that Denit is designed for one, maybe two night stays (after all it is \"Night&Breakfast\"). I've deliberately ignored this fact, and some of my experiences described above came from this. Overall it was a very nice stay.

Best part of this location is its quiet both from the rooms next to you (great soundproofing) and fact that instead of heading to the right out the door of the hotel, hit the busy plaza and down Las Rablas, you can exit left and skip the crowds and make your way zig zagging down fun alleyways. Reception if fantastic. Remember your paying significantly less at this place, and while they do not skimp on comfort or style, the rooms are smaller and spaces in general are as well in the hotel. We had a business deluxe that was bigger then average room but still small by US standards but perfectly fine. The shower was large with translucent glass doors to the main room -- maybe for the privacy picky it might be a bit of a problem, but we think not as you can not see clearly in. Breafkast was included in our rate -- very good but odd they did not include yogurt which is a staple at most Euro breakfasts. Highly recommend mgmt throw this down at the table ;) Great advice for eating Tapas around the corner the first night we didnt feel like going far (Taller Tappas). I think its great find. The only complaint was the free internet was painfully slow. Painful I say.

It was already recommended to me by a friend but I also made sure to check other reviews on Trip Advisor. The hotel is located down an alley way off a main street. Our taxi driver was not familiar with the address of the hotel but I showed him the map that was on the Hotel Denit website and lucky I did, as he knew how to get there from the main street. MY RECOMMENDATION TO YOU IS TO PRINT THE MAP ON THE WEBSITE. The hotel is a 1 minute walk from Placa De Catalunya. From the Placa you can get on the hop on/hop off buses (highly recommend this - we saw the entire city in 1 day). The Aero Bus also stops at this location so you can easily catch the bus from the airport or catch one to the airport. The cost was 5.20 Euro per adult. From the outside, the hotel resembles a shop front. It is very cool and funky. The reception staff are all lovely. They speak english very well and were very helpful with directions and recommendations. The hotel is very clean and white. Our room both times was clean and comfortable. We selected the business double room both times. The shower and toilet are located together in a wet room setting. This looks great ,but be aware that the tiles around the toilet get very slippery after the shower has been used. The bed was king size and very comfortable. They offered cable tv on a large screen plasma. Our room overlooked the alley way which was fine as there is no noise at all coming from below. Breakfast was included with our room and it was delicious! We actually looked forward to it each morning. There is a selection of 2 cereals, juice, coffee, fresh fruit, croissants, bread, rolls, ham, cheese, tomatoes, cupcakes. When we arrived on a Sunday, most of the stores are closed. So if you were to walk around the nearby alley ways you would think you were in a dingy city. All stores have roller shutters which are closed on a Sunday. Come Monday, the alley streets came alive with colourful shop fronts and people everywhere! Las Ramblas, the main street, is only a couple of minutes walk from the Denit. It is very tourity indeed. The shops are mostly souvenir shops all selling the same stuff. Traffic flows down Las Ramblas on either side of a paved walkway (mall). As you walk down the mall you are surrounded by lots of people, street performers and pick pockets! Hold onto your handbags. Wear one over your head and shoulder, that hangs across the front of your body. Hold onto it very tightly. There are a lot of distractions and you will be looking up, down, left and right at all these amazing things. Don't think it can't happen to you - 2 women from our cruise had their pures stolen out of their handbags whilst we wre touring through Rome and Florence in Italy. Barcelona is also a known area for pick pockets and BEGGERS. We were approached several times by young and old female beggers holding out cups and asking for money. Just walk by and ignore them. We also saw a woman with a baby sitting on the sidwalk begging for money. If you walk all the way down Las Ramblas towards the water, you will reach the marina. There is a shopping centre there which is the only place we found open on a Sunday. There are food stalls there as well as a few restaurants. We ate at Tapa Tapa located just outside of the centre. We thought it would be a real spanish experience. The menus are in english and have pictures so you can see exactly what you will get. We found the food okay. It wasn't the best but the service was good and we enjoyed the views around us. I wouldn't eat there again though. Also on Las Ramblas there are many restaurants and some have people out the front inviting you in. We didn't eat in any of them as they didn't look great and I don't like places that have to grab people from the street. We did eat at an italian restaurant - why my husband selected Italian food in Spain I don't know. He ate a pizza which he said was good. I had a soup. Enough said. On our second last night at the Denit we found the best restaurant. It is called Taller Tapas and is located just around the corner from the hotel. Step out of the hotel and turn left. Walk to the end of the alley way and turn left again. Walk along this street and nearing the end of the alley on the right you will find the restaurant. It was the best tapas we had in Barcelona (and also in Australia). We ate there on our last 2 nights. First night we selected various tapas dishes and shared. Leave room for the dark & white chocolate mousse - it melts in your mouth. The second night we ordered the seafood paella. It cost only 12.80 Euro. Amazing price for a wonderful dish. The serve isn't huge - perfect for 1 but if you are sharing then you may wish to order some tapas to have beforehand - it takes 20 mintes for the paella, but worth the wait. Denit's location is the best, it is great value for money and the rooms are clean, white and comfortable. There is a hair dryer in each room but if you have wild hair like me you may wish to still bring your own, theirs is not powerful enough. My only negative (and this is indeed very minor) is that there isn't a retractable clothes line in the wet room. Some of us wash our smalls rather than send them to the dry cleaner. I would definitely stay there again and would recommend it to family and friends. The rooms only house 1 - 2 persons so you will need to book more than 1 room if you are a family of 4 or more.", "Date": "May 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cIs this your left luggage room??\u201d", "Author": "MissLiddia", "ReviewID": "UR110349684", "Content": "This hotel featured in an article we read in the observer a short while ago.

For comfort and ease, my partner and I took turns to change while the other took a short stroll elsewhere as we found there just isn't the room to maneuver in such a small space . I stress again the room is small. Front desk did hear my concerns but due to the hotel being fully booked we could not be moved to another room. Another point which has already been mentioned on previous posts is the shower facility. There is no divide between shower and toilet meaning the toilet gets showered. This is quite obviously a planning fault and if you do intend to use the toilet, make sure it is before a shower and not after as the whole area is wet through. I made this point clear to the front desk and they seemed surprised...yet as I say, this has been raised in previous posts already so I question how big a surprise it was.

The location of Denit is incredible; Only a 1 minute walk to or from the Placa de Catalunya and Aerobus stop, and a two minute walk to the popular La Rambla. The Denit is nestled between two alleys, so sleep quality for my seven nights there was great; Absolutely no traffic noise whatsoever despite the Place de Catalunya being very close. The only noise I encountered in the hotel was the occasional inconsiderate guest allowing their door to slam late at night or early in the morning. My room was clean and comfortable; Linens on the bed were clean and new, with towels in the bathroom clean, large, and fluffy. Housekeeping did a geat job each day freshening the room. Personnel at the front desk were polite and friendly and spoke great English. In the past, other TripAdvisor members have commented how poor the breakfast was in the morning at Denit. This was completely NOT the case while I was there, as the breakfast consisted of two types of cold cereal, several types of fresh fruit (pineapple, pears, oranges, and apples), several types of fresh bread (croissants, sourdough, baguettes), two types of muffins (chocolate and white), chocolate doughnuts, white cheese, two types of ham (both cold ham and the expensive Iberian-cured variety), coffee, bottled water, and milk. It is a VERY filling breakfast and more than enough to get you going in the morning!

Also, the showers are cool, but seem to have a design flaw that makes it so that water gets all over the place. All of us had issues with that. The breakfast at the Hotel was a good, typical hotel breakfast, Spanish style. The staff was amazing. Although the hotel has little postings all over with cool things to do aorund Barcelona, we found way cooler stuff by talking to the staff, and they all seemed to appreciate be inquired upon for their personal favorite hot spots.

The free wi-fi in the lobby was definately great though. Overall, we had a great experience with Hotel Denit.

Chosen from Tripadvisor, this hotel is great for the visitor wishing to see all the sights. It is a few minutes walk from the airport bus stop in Placa Catalunya. Very easy from the airport and costing \u20ac5 each - you get to see a bit of the city on the way! El Ramblas is 5 minutes away and an easy few minutes walk to the centre of the Gothic Quarter. The Gaudi houses which are a must see at night are also within walking distance.The Tour Bus leaves from Place Catalunya just a few minutes walk from the hotel but it's the main stop and the queues were horrendous when we were there. Our advice would be to have a very early breakfast on the day you plan to go on the tour bus and get to the bus stop before 10.00. The 2 loops on the bus are highly recommended! have a nice rest after a day on the hoof as we did. If you want free tapas - sit at the bar rather than tables.

Yes, you can see the silouhette of the person's EVERY MOVE, whether on the toilet, or in the shower!!!! No sound proofing AT ALL which was a little bit embarrassing!!! There was a tiny bit of a table, and a wooden 'Director's Chair', and that was it. There was also a flat screen television and air conditioning which was very necessary. My first reaction was to groan out loud, and we wanted to turn around and leave. Having said all that, it was spotless, beds very comfortable. The location was fantastic - literally a stone's throw from the Placa Catalunya, across the road from the department store El Corte Ingles, 2 minutes walk from the public airport shuttle which leaves every 10 minutes or so to every terminal at the airport, and we felt very safe, even though we had to walk down a laneway. About 200 metres away is the Hard Rock Cafe. There is no 'bar', even though you can order a drink or coffee at the reception. The breakfast (5 euros) was poor, only the bare continental (no cheeses or cold meats - a slice of bread, muffin, two choices of cereal and only coffee) - there is a Starbucks right behind the hotel and plenty other places to have breakfast very nearby so we ended up going to other places. This hotel is certainly not the type of hotel you'd want to stay in if you were on a romantic weekend - the walls are paper thin, we could hear every conversation from the people across the hallway, and then of course the glass door to the toilet/shower, but you just can't beat the location, and it is very clean.

The room was on the small side which is typical in Europe, so not unexpected. It was modern and had a room safe, wonderful shower, air conditioning, and a flat screen TV where we managed to find a few English speaking channels. My only gripe is that there wasn't any space in the bathroom by the sink for me to put personal stuff like cosmetics or shaving stuff. We had to put them on the floor. We had the room on the main floor that was setup for disabled folks, so the shower was right in the main part of the bathroom with nothing dividing it from the rest of the bathroom. As a result everything would get wet when you took a shower, so you had to remove everything first to keep your cosmetics/shaving stuff from getting soaked. I had hoped to iron some rumpled clothes but they didn't have irons, only a laundry service that would've made it very expensive (approx 8 Euro for a blouse). The staff was very helpful, pleasant, and friendly. They kept our bags locked up in a back room on our last day so we could continue to sightsee until it was time for us to leave to catch our flight.

We wanted 1 room that would accomodate the 3 of us and found this hotel on TripAdvisor. It was fantastic. Can't praise it enough. It was a 10 euro cab ride from the port to the Plaza Catalunya and finding the hotel is a bit tricky - it's down an alley near the larger of the 2 El Cortes Ingles hotels in the plaza. But what a hidden gem! As others have noted, the rooms are small and IKEA-like, but very stylish and comfortable. They supplied a cot for my daughter that was very sleepable and the linens and everything in the room was super clean. Breakfast was included and excellent. The staff was very friendly and went out of their way to help our daughter who wanted a Barcelona World Cup jersey as a gift. We were there on a national holiday and many of the stores were closed, but they moved heaven and earth to help us find an open retailer. The Hotel Denit is the perfect launching pad for touristing and as others have noted, the bus to the airport is a stone's throw from the hotel with multiple buses lined up for the quick and cheap ride to the airport. The plaza is also a stop for the HopOnHopOff bus. We absolutely adored Barcelona and will definitely be back. This wouldn't be the right property for someone looking to lounge around a spacious room, but it's a cool and centrally located property with terrific service. We had a wonderful meal at La Tagliatella, Rhonda Universitat, 31 which is a 5-minute walk from the hotel across the plaza.

We ate out for all meals including breakfast as if you turn left out of the hotel there are loads of little eateries selling croissants etc which are ideal for a cheap breakfast. Rooms were extremely clean and comfortable- we had a wet room which did mean the floor was then wet when you wanted to go to the toilet. I pod dock was great, and flat screen sony tv on the wall too. Not much room to put clothes but on a short city break this wasn't too much of a problem. Only real downside was our room was very dark. It was at the back of the hotel and the only window overlooked an internal courtyard which also contained the windows of peoples flats so there was washing hanging out and even a childs bath suspended on a rope!!!

We are a family of four and were travelling through Europe for a month this summer. The rooms were booked for us, so we didn\u2019t pay for them, but we did see that the room rate was 69 Euros per night. The check-in clerk was very friendly. Her English was far better than my daughter\u2019s Spanish (which is far better than my Spanish). We were given two rooms, on separate floors. The rooms were the same size and were very small \u2013 perhaps 10 X 10 feet. Because my son and I were sharing a room, and the bed was similarly small, we slid the mattress off its foundation to create two \u201cbeds\u201d. He slept on the mattress, I slept on the foundation. The two \u201chalves\u201d side by side (not end to end) took up the entire width of the room. There was a small amount of floor space at the foot of the bed. Overall, I\u2019d say that the bed alone (when the mattress was still on top of it) took up about 40% of the room\u2019s footprint. As this was the first stop of our vacation, I initially thought that perhaps this tiny room size was normal by European standards. However, our other accommodation on our trip was more in keeping with North American sizes. The rooms at the Hotel Denit were perhaps 20-25% the size of a typical North American hotel room. Another odd quirk was that the electricity in the room would not operate unless the room\u2019s card-key was inserted into a slot in the wall. I presume this is a cost-savings measure that ensures that you don\u2019t leave the lights on and the air-conditioning running while you\u2019re out for the day. It wasn't a big problem but it had the potential to be inconvenient. On the positive side, the hotel could not be any closer to the centre of action. It is about a block to Catalunya Plaza, which is one of the main (and perhaps THE main) centres in Barcelona. From the Plaza you can access the subway/metro, tour busses, express airport bus, etc. Note that the hotel is on a very narrow street (so narrow that I\u2019m not sure a car could actually fit). There are hundreds of these narrow streets in Barcelona and every one looks almost like a movie set! As a result, while the Hotel is in the centre of the action, there is no traffic or other street noise. We enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Denit.

The Aerobus drops you a block away from the hotel and the Bus Touristic tour starts at the same place. Most sights are within walking distance or can be reached by a bus or metro from the Placa de Catalunya. The Hotel Denit itself is VERY clean and modern - my husband and I joked that we wish that we could afford to have a house designed in the same fashion. The room is large with a great shower and flat screen tv. The breakfast each morning was great for fueling up before a long day of sight-seeing. Although we did not take advantage of the free WiFi in our room, we used the WiFi in the lobby which always worked and was totally free. The staff is very friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. The only complaint we had (and this is a VERY minor complaint) is that the hotel does not have an iron for its guests to use. But when you are on vacation in a beautiful place and not being able to iron is the worst of your troubles, I think you have it pretty good. Overall, we LOVED the Hotel Denit and would recommend it highly to anyone traveling to Barcelona.", "Date": "August 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kingston, Jamaica", "Title": "\u201cExcellent value for money\u201d", "Author": "mcfKingston_Jamaica", "ReviewID": "UR74234172", "Content": "Such a modern hotel - absolutely delightful.

I had done extensive research about this hotel and alternatives in travel books and TripAdvisor. My gut told me Denit would have the right combination of features, and I was spot on. Hotel Denit was our favorite lodging in our three-country European trip. Yes, the breakfast is a bit skimpy, but for 5 EUROS per person in advance \u2013 about the price of an ice cream cone, you really can\u2019t complain! Instead, appreciate the hotel\u2019s ideal location right of the Plaza Catalu\u00f1a down a safe side street away from all the noise. There were other hotels I had considered which cost more but were located in very slummy areas far away from all this action. You can\u2019t beat the location of this hotel, and unlike so many other downtown hotels, you can sleep at night too! Besides the location, there were so many things that the Hotel did right: the d\u00e9cor was funky, modern, yet also functional -- not too over the top. Our slightly larger \u201cbusiness\u201d room (worth the premium) was plenty large for three people. There was a king-sized bed which actually consisted of two twins or full beds joined but with single sheets, covered by a VERY comfortable light comforter. There was a flat-screen TV attached to the wall next to a very functional A/C unit. However, our favorite part of the room was the bathroom shower combination. Sure, there\u2019s no shower curtain, but this is clearly by design. There\u2019s a sliding glass door that keeps water away from the main room, so it\u2019s just a question of putting a floor mat near the toilet. Not a big deal, especially since the shower is by far the best we\u2019ve ever experienced: ceiling unit spraying water with high intensity straight down like a true waterfall. We were taking two showers a day! Last but not least, the staff at this hotel is young, helpful, but not overbearing. Far more personable than in one of those larger hotels, but still a step beyond a single host or hostess you would find in a B&B. All in all, this was one of the better hotel finds of my entire life and I couldn\u2019t imagine returning to Barcelona without staying here again.", "Date": "August 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "benn77", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel - brilliant location\u201d", "Author": "benn77", "ReviewID": "UR73795886", "Content": "Just come back from a long weekend in Barcelona staying 3 nights in the hotel Denit.

The location was spot on for what we wanted \u2013 close to transport, it\u2019s about 5 minutes walk to Placa Catalunya, which is a main metro train station and is where the airport buses stop, and the hotel was walking distance to pretty much everywhere. The front desk staff spoke English fluently and were very helpful with reservations, directions, and general sightseeing advice. Wireless internet was freely available from the lobby, but accessing it from the room required a new password every day, valid for only half an hour. The room itself was a double overlooking an internal courtyard with windows that opened out. The beds were a little problematic. As with most European hotels, the double was actually two singles, but unlike other places that made them up as a single bed, these were individually made, although there was only about an inch of space between them. When we complained to the staff, they said to just push them together. Not an ideal solution, but there wasn\u2019t much else we could do. Unfortunately, the two beds were of different firmness, which felt weird when pushed together. We were also only given one pillow each, and the pillows were quite soft. The room was reasonably spacious, about 7x3m, plus a shower/toilet cubicle. The layout of the room was innovative - the vanity/sink was incorporated into the main room to maximise space, while the wet area was kept separate. It seemed to work reasonably well. The room had standard toiletries \u2013 shower gel, soap, shower cap, shampoo, and moisturiser. No tissues, and they only had one spare roll of toilet paper available at a time (most places have two spare rolls). One awesome feature, though, was the showerhead \u2013 big, beautiful rain-showerhead, resulting in truly blissful showers. The cleaners were good, but two points against them: they were quite inconsistent with replacing used toiletries, and they would start cleaning the rooms a lot earlier than we liked, so a few times they would knock on our doors to see if we were in and we had to send them away a couple of times. To be fair, the hotel didn\u2019t provide \u201cdo not disturb\u201d signs so it was hard for them to tell if we were in or not. The room was air conditioned, but it seemed to not work properly a couple of times. One bad thing about the room which we didn\u2019t realise until a few days into our stay, was that the room had no fridge, which meant we couldn\u2019t keep cold water or buy many foods from the markets. Not an issue if you\u2019re only staying a couple of days, but it became an issue with our 10-night stay. Didn\u2019t have the breakfast so can\u2019t comment on that. Overall, I would recommend this hotel for a short stay, for a longer stay I would consider other options that included a fridge, better internet access, and a nicer \u201cchill-out\u201d environment.", "Date": "July 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, service, and clean!\u201d", "Author": "mea2001", "ReviewID": "UR71350145", "Content": "This hotel was in a perfect location, it's located on a small street but at the same time it's right by La Ramblas as well as the Aerobus.

If you want to use wi-fi in the rooms you must pay for it, however it is free inside the lobby. I recommend you eat tapas at the Boqueria market every morning. For a quick and cheap lunch go to Maos vegetarian, and also instead of going to Las Ramblas everyday, make a left from the hotel and try the little bakeries and get some sandwiches there for a picnic. You can also take a bus straight to Parc Guell (highlight of my trip), and a bus straight to the beach from this location. Just ask the front desk which bus to take. Enjoy your stay in Barcelona!

The hotel's location is the best thing about it - absolutely perfect. It's easy to find, and you're right in the centre, but in a quiet, safe street - we had no problems at all walking back in the early hours of the morning. The hotel itself is very Ikea-ish (i.e. modern, basic, but in parts, quite stylish), and the reception area is spotlessly clean with nice contemporary decor. The staff were friendly enough, but nothing special. Our room (11) was lovely, and much more spacious than we'd anticipated, with plenty of storage space; however it was a little dark at times, even in spite of the light decor (although this was largely due to the fact that the hotel is in a narrow street, therefore the buildings opposite blocked out the light). The bathroom was nice and modern, with a wetroom-style shower and glass partition screen between that and the toilet. The sink was just outside it in the bedroom - this was not a problem at all. A big problem however, was the fact that every time we used the shower, the bathroom floor would get completely soaked, and we'd have to use two towels to mop up the water before we stepped on to the slippy floor - frustrating and a bit of a hazard which definitely needs revising - the partition screen is nowhere near sufficient to block the splashes. Another HUGE problem for us was the lack of soundproofing in the room. I'm not a light sleeper, at all, but I was woken every single night and morning by the sound of footsteps, doors, general chattering and, mainly, the sound of next door's shower, which sounded as though it was in our room - seriously, we heard everything from around the hotel and we had a bad night's sleep every single night of our stay as a result of this - massively disappointing because our first impression of the hotel was a good one; it seemed a calm sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of the city to relax in.

There were enough English channels on TV, and the other features like AC, city brochures were in place.

Luckily, I knew it was located on a hidden street, so we had little trouble finding it. I also knew, thankfully, that we had to insert our room key-card into the slot in order for the lights and air conditioner to work. The location could not be better. We walked everywhere - and I mean everywhere - from this hotel. It was very clean, modern and white. Felt a bit like an Ikea showroom, actually. The bathroom door is frosted so it offers a bit more privacy in the shower than many of the other hotels' showers, which was good, as I shared the room with a co-worker/friend. The beds were very comfortable. We laughed every time we put the shade up and down because the pull-cord made so much noise and took a long time to move the shade - I don't know who would design such a crazy thing. The view from our room (#14) was awful, but we weren't really looking for a great view, as we were only there to sleep. We couldn't hear any outside noise at all, because the hotel is on more of an alley than a street, and our room was on the back side. My only complaint is that our room was right next to a maintenance closet, which was opened and closed many times each morning. Every time the door slammed, I woke up. Honestly, all the doors slam loudly, so if you're a light sleeper, this could be a problem. It was for me. There was construction on the surface of the alley/street while we were there, which was a bit of an eyesore, but by the end of the week the whole street will have nice tiles. As others on TripAdvisor have mentioned, you get only 30 minutes a day of free wireless, but we weren't there to be on Facebook or to work. We did not get the breakfast at the hotel. There are many places nearby for breakfast. Everyone we spoke to at the front desk was very helpful. Thank you especially to Cynthia and Davide who answered a lot of questions for us.

And given the price, I would say it's a bargain.", "Date": "September 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockholm, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cExcellent and affordable hotel\u201d", "Author": "william16", "ReviewID": "UR38859356", "Content": "I throughly enjoyed this hotel considering the price. Everyone spoke good english and were very helpful. Stayed in a business bedroom and loved the design, very slick! It was clean, with a modern, simple and well though-out furnishing. The location was great too, at the edge of Barri Gotic almost next to Plaza de Cataluna. Considering the price, I can definitely recommend this hotel. There are only a couple of bad things I could mention. First, regarding the location, the hotel is in a alley (nothing strange about that, Barri Gotic is from the gothic era and is full of picturesque alleys everywhere) which has a bad smell. Inside the hotel you will not notice it, so it is not a big deal. Secondly, internet access is only free 24/7 in the lobby/lounge via wifi provided you use your own laptop. Otherwise you get free internet access for only 30 minutes using the computers in the lobby or your laptop in the bedroom. If you need more time, it costs (staying in a business bedroom made no difference in this regard), and you will need to have a working mobile phone to receive a code sent via a SMS message so you can login.", "Date": "August 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lansdale, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cGreat location at a great price!\u201d", "Author": "ilovecalvin", "ReviewID": "UR38494742", "Content": "Hotel Denit was at a great location, in the heart of Placa Catalunya. You have the convenience of hopping on the metro, bus, aerobus, and all the tourist bus in a matter of a few minutes. The hotel in itself was trendy and clean. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. There were few things I wish they had, such as a towel bar for the smaller towels, but these became trivial since we didn't spend much time in the hotel. The breakfast food was at best okay but enough to get your started until lunch time. The best part about the experience was the price. Prior to our Barcelona trip, we were in Paris. Our room at Denit was probably 1.5 times bigger than the one in Paris, but 40 euros less per night. We stayed in a double plus, which was big enough to open 2 large suitcases comfortably and enough storage for clothes. Each customer was allowed 30 minutes of free internet each day during your stay with the computer ONLY in the lobby. Of course, free wifi would have been more ideal but we never had to wait for the computer downstairs. There is an option of wifi with a price. I would highly recommend this hotel. Location is premium and VERY VERY convenient. The aerobus is right around the corner and only 30-40 minutes away from the airport. Can't beat that. I'm sure you can find a more luxurious hotel in town, but it's hard to find one at an affordable price at an ideal location with a spacious room.", "Date": "August 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "cork", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel, central location near many of the main tourist sites, great price,\u201d", "Author": "aduane", "ReviewID": "UR38155752", "Content": "I stayed in the Hotel Denit in Aug 2009 for 5 nights. From the moment I checked in to the moment I checked out, it was a pleasant experience. The staff were very friendly and the buffet breakfast was ideal. My single room was compact but perfect for my stay and it was well equipped. The hotel is noise free as it is off the main street. Only 2 minutes to Las Ramblas and many other major sites are within minutes walking distance including the great market area and the Gothic quarter. Metro Catalunya (green line) is only 2 mins walk also. Placa de Catalunya is just across the road. Loads of musical entertainment on the streets nearby with tons of restaurants, cafes, shops, shopping, cinema, bars, within a few minutes walk. You won't get better value and quality in the centre of Barcelona. Highly recommend this hotel and I will definitely stay here again.", "Date": "August 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens", "Title": "\u201cClean hotel, central location, bad breakfast, no sound-proof\u201d", "Author": "lhalep", "ReviewID": "UR37804176", "Content": "ROOMS -Nice minimalistic interrior, excellent modern stylist, seemed brand new, cleaned very well every day! -Unfortunately very bad sound-proofing conditions, you could here every door opening and closing in your floor!! People chatting next door, the channel on their tv...and so on.. LOCATION -Central location which was excellent since there were everything at your feet. -Unfortunately the hotel location was in a dark narrow alley, with limited lighting, a little dangerous at my point of view since there is a lot of criminal activity with people asking for money and stealing (we had 2 such occurence in Spain, one of which, we had to call the police, neither of them were on the hotel alley) BREAKFAST -The breakfast area has a nice touch but the breakfast itself had limited options, the employees responsible for the breakfast were not that polite (probably because of the comments that everybody made). The quantities were also a serious issue. One hour after the breakfast was served half of the breakfast was not available. Naturaly they were repliying that if people come at the opening time, they would be enough for everyone..Something that does not make sense!! Clearly they do not had enough for everybody. I have stayed 5 days and everyday I heard people complaining. In general I would recommend this hotel as a combination of price and room condition in accordance to location. Although the hotel should review a lot of issues. It has the potential of beeing a top rated hotel. Its issues are easily resolved.", "Date": "August 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat surprise! fantastic hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Viajera885", "ReviewID": "UR37522316", "Content": "Stayed at Denit Hotel with my girlfriend last week, it was a surprise for my birthday.

Rooms are perfectly and delicately decorated, also very comfortable. Breakfast has a good choice and it\u00b4s just delicious. Staff is extremely helpful and friendly, not the kind of hypocrit people who makes an obligated smile. We really felt in home and that\u00b4s very important when you are travelling for a long time.
