The staff were very friendly, helpful and very willing to answer any questions. The hotel was in such a great location in Berlin, the area felt safe and was surrounded by many lovely restaurants and the train was only a 10 min walk, easy to get to the airport which was only 30 mins on the train. The rooms were clean and very good value for money. The breakfast was lovely, serving cereal, meats, cheese, bread and boiled eggs. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a very reasonably priced room in a central location.", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat little gem\u201d", "Author": "Bettbug", "ReviewID": "UR116243843", "Content": "We stayed in July with mother in law and teenage daughter. Booked one triple and one single room (they even have quad rooms). Pension is on ground level, only about three or four stairs to walk up. Arrived by car. Parking was EUR5.00/day right in front of the hotel. They will provide a parking permit. 6 minute walk to the train station. 5 minute walk through leafy streets to the Kurfurstendamm. The decor of the big rooms is a bit dated, but clean and due to very high ceilings rooms feel spacious. The windows have roller shutters to block out any noise. The bathrooms have been added to the rooms at a later stage, so they are a bit on the small side. The shower cabin is really small, but very good water pressure. Towels are provided. Rooms are made up every day. The breakfast is huge. Great choice of cold meats, cheeses, friut, joghurt, bread rolls, jam. Coffee pot for the table with bottomless refills. Very friendly helpful staff, NO CREDIT CARDS, unbeatable value for money in a historic part of town. Can not fault this Pension, would return any time.", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rome, Italy", "Title": "\u201cGood location and nice stay\u201d", "Author": "PeopleTravelling", "ReviewID": "UR103030748", "Content": "This is a pension in a nice Berlin district, well connected with the city center, via tube or walking. Our room was comfortable, for a very good price. Inernet wifi connection is free. The breakfast is paid separately, but we didn't try it, cause there are a lot of very nice cafeteria very near the pension.

Luckily I found this little gem for under 90 euros per night. Located in the Charlottenburg district just off the Ku-Damm, it's a small family run place located off Mommsenstrasse around a small courtyard. On arrival the owner gave us a choice of 2 rooms and was very helpful in letting us know abut public transport info & the like. The room decor was somewhat old-fashioned but the room was quite spacious, the shower was hot & powerful, & the bed was really comfortable. Breakfast is a cold buffet with bread, ham, sausage, cheese, yogurt, fruit, juices and tea/coffee, and plenty of it. The only drawback to the hotel was the pillows - they are too small and you only get one. The local area is fantastic, with loads of shops, cafes, restaurants & bars. We spent a lot of time in House of 100 Beers, Harp Irish Pub and Klo Bar (a really weird toilet-themed bar). Metro station is around 5-10 mins' walk away. A taxi to Tegel airport takes around 15 mins and costs 15-20 euros depending on the route. And Messe Berlin is 5 mins away on the S-Bahn if you're there for an exhbition. Highly recommended, in short!", "Date": "March 26, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Pension Majesty Berlin Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d596400-Reviews-Pension_Majesty_Berlin_Hotel-Berlin.html", "Price": "$56 - $109*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Mommsenstrasse 55</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10629 </span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "596400", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/36/4c/364c294c25e7a6db077e14b4aa28ff4e6large.jpg"}}
