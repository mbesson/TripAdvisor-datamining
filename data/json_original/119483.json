Best of all, it's access in and out is excellent since the entrance is on Olympic rather than one of the busier streets like Wilshire or Santa Monica. The valet staff was also very fast and we literally never waited more than a couple minutes for our car, even at 5:00 a.m. I've read that this hotel was renovated which I find surprising because the hallways are very unattractive for a Marriott. The rooms are standardly decorated, but spotlessly clean (a major requirement for me). Our bathroom was very tiny, only fitting the toilet and shower. The sink is located outside of the bathroom. We had a king sized bed which came with three very small pillows. Larger pillows would have been more comfortable, but in all fairness, I never asked for extras and the staff was so accommodating, I have no doubt they would have responded to such a request. A great plus is free in-room WiFi which is something surprisingly unusual.

The hotel staff, valet, bar/resturant staff, everyone was very professional and very nice. Any questions asked, someone had an answer and were willing to help. The rooms were very clean, which is a biggie for me. I have a bit of an OCD problem when it comes to cleaness! The location was good as well. If you are looking to just be able to walk to places though, this is not the place for you. The closest attraction is the mall, which is about a 15 minute walk. You will need a rental car if you stay here. Downtown LA is about 25 minutes away. But you are close to Rodeo drive. Only about a 10 minute drive. I liked it because it is in Beverly Hills and you are out of the way of all the madness that goes on in Hollywood when it's time to go to bed! I will aboslutely be back.

I would probably prefer to stay at the Plaza but I'm still glad I booked here as I personally did not have issues on this hotel. In fact, I actually had a pleasant stay. My room was perfect for me. It was roomy, smells and feels clean. My sheets and my king size bed were comfortable. Most importantly, my room was very quiet. My first time to sleep 7 hours straight since my son was born. So yea, this deserve a 4 stars in my book. By all means, this hotel is more of a 3 stars hotel but pleasant stay and good night sleep is priceless.

You have to go down hallways and up stairs to get to the room elevators and that is all understandable. What is less understandable - especially given the circumstances is that the other aspects of the hotel come up way short as well. The room was dated and small - an oddity in all of the Courtyard rooms I have been in over the last 12 years.

No eggs, no water, no yogurt, no milk, no tomato juice, etc. Then, when going to print out my boarding pass for the flight out of LAX, the first printer was out of ink and the pass came out illegible.

We decided not to rent a car for the week, partly because of the $20 daily parking fee at the hotel and partly because we would not be doing any extracirricular activities. Due to construction in the lobby, the normal in and out of the hotel was somewhat inconvenient. Check-in was a makeshift lobby just off the garage. Then you walk down one flight of stairs to another \"lobby\" where you catch the elevator to your floor. The staff was extremely helpful to us - each time my wife and I arrived or departed, they sent a driver with a golf cart to the lower lobby to bring us to the upper lobby. They also provided a wheelchair so my wife could more easily get from the elevator to our room. Since we had opted not to rent a car, we needed a taxi to the hospital each day for three days. The hotel staff referred us to a limo service (Turbo Limos - Mr. Harry Kim)that took us back and forth for less than the cost of a taxi (confimed, as we did use a taxi once). Harry also drove us to the airport to go home for a lower price than we had paid another limo the day we arrived. I highly recommend the limo service. The location is good as far as being on a main artery. If you don't have your own transportation, it is not so hot for stuff nearby (i.e. restaurants).

Negative: I spoke with a nice clerk sharing my perception of this stay (I have stayed at 15-20 Courtyards across the country, this is the worst) he was receptive and documented it well.

Cons: Parking: Parking around the Hotel is PERMIT ONLY...so 15 bucks a day is not THAT bad in LA or at the location but of course it sucks it you have visitors...Most other places down by Pico/Beverly charge 22 a day. There is a Ralphs across the way that you can try and park at BUT as the hotel's valet put it \"at rush hour it is harder to cross then the Mexican Border into the USA\". I also didn't want to park on the Ralph's top level becuase there was some homeless guy dancing at 1am..If you park at Ralph's go for the lower/covered parking area near the Holiday Inn Express... The Lobby is Super Small but they do offer free coffee which saves you a trip to starbucks if you grab some ice from the machine to make it ICED....Also if you want a more discreet hotel this one is tough becuase there always seem to be lots of workers around.. Rooms: Small, clean but nothing special..small bathroom...Sadly, I wasn't really even impressed by the 2 room Suite. I have had better suite stays at Comfort Suites..
