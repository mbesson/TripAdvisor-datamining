The rooms are spacious, with a kitchenette separated from the bedroom. The bathroom is clean. The breakfast is very complete with a lot of variety. An special mention goes to Pedro, the concierge, who was very kind and helpfull with everything we needed. Perhaps, the rooms- at least the one I stayed in- need to be painted again.", "Date": "June 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scarborough, North Yorkshire", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Value Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Haze-D", "ReviewID": "UR20172642", "Content": "This was an excellent hotel. Very well located - just 2 or 3 stops on the Metro from Placa De Catalunya. Nearest Metro station was Muntaner and was a few steps from the hotel. The Reception staff were really friendly and helpful. The room was clean and spacious and had it's own small kitchen area, lounge and a table to either eat or work at. Excellent value for money and as we stayed at the weekend it was really quiet at night so you had a good nights sleep. Not much to do in the immediate area but as it was so near to the metro this didn't cause any problems.", "Date": "September 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "carnaxide", "Title": "\u201cnot for me...\u201d", "Author": "DuncanCarnaxide", "ReviewID": "UR7974886", "Content": "I\u00b4ve stayed for two nights, in single room, in this hotel. \u00cd must confesse that it was very dissapointing.This is a small aparthotel, well located, in Via Augusta,in a very quiet residential neighbourhood.it was a perfect location for me, but that\u00b4s not the only thing we looked in a hotel. I\u00b4ve check- up late in the night, and at the recepcion I asked for the wake up allarm in the next morning....They forgottened!!! the room was very old, and not very clean. the bed had too much hair...but not mine!The floor was dirty, and I made a test, by putting a small paper (the size of a 2 euros\u00b4s coin) in the bathroom floore in the first night, and i\u00b4t stayed there until I checked out. I knew also every time the metro was passing under the hotel... the breakfast was simple, but ok, and the staff was kindly but not very efficiente. probably I will not repeat this stay.", "Date": "June 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ayrshire, Scotland", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Senator\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4076220", "Content": "We have arrived home from Spain this week after a great four nights with friends, in the City Senator Hotel, Barcelona. Rooms were basic, clean and comfortable but could have done with a few reproduction paintings or photos, especially about Gaudi, on the walls. The breakfast room was on the small side and if the hotel was full there tended to be a bit of a queue although there was no reason why you could not take your breakfast to your own room. We booked the rooms through Easyjet and paid only \u00a3203 (299 Euros) for 4 nights bed and breakfast. When you pay a visit to Barcelona you do not spend much time in a hotel room - you spend it in the restaurants and bars and sightseeing, not necessarily in that order!!!", "Date": "October 31, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "City Senator Aparthotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d239524-Reviews-City_Senator_Aparthotel-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$131 - $172*", "Address": "<div class=\"amenFloat\">", "HotelID": "239524", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/29/d2/29d2033325c81bd9e54ffac3caa849637large.jpg"}}
