The write-ups were not ideal and on arrival expectations remain low as you descend to the basement reception and lounge area....but from there on I only have praise for this hotel and I would definitely stay there again. The rooms (certainly the four that we had) were spacious, clean, well maintained and serviced promptly each morning. Breakfast, included in the price, was reasonably good (and predictable). I have only two downsides to report - (1) the huge numbers of guests who descended for breakfast each morning putting some degree of strain on the capacity and resources....but nevertheless the breakfast staff seemed to replenish stocks and turnaround tables very efficiently so that the experience was generally okay (I don't know if this is a regular thing or wether the hotel was operating at full capacity during our visit); and (2) there are only two very small elevators/lifts (one holds max 3 persons and the other holds max 4 persons) and like breakfast, these were sometimes incapable of handling demand....but a short wait or the star is were not a problem if you are able and have just a little patience. The reception staff too were efficient and courteous and handled any problems we had without fuss. We paid circa 1,500 Euros fro our 4 nights for 12 people, so I would say the Hotel Rex was very good value for money at under 30Euros per head per night. The location is brilliant for tourist city break only a few steps from the main shopping area, Puerta Del Sol, Plaza Mayor, Palacio Real next to Corte Ingles and the Callao Metro.

Very close to Sol and Plaza Mayor which are nice areas. We took the city tour bus which was good and then the next day we walked to many of the attractions.

The hotel is right on the Calle Gran Via (main road), close to a metro stop but also convenient when you want to walk to all the hotspots in town. We had a room in one of the upper floors on the street side. Although the room was in a corner, partially facing the main road, we never heard any noise wile we were sleeping. During the day time, you would here the traffic and buzz of people walking by, but not to loud that it would upset you. I have to say we never slept with the window open because the air-co worked perfectly. The room was very clean with comfortable beds, enough room in the bathroom and enough space in the closet for clothes of two girls :D Breakfast is really lovely. There is plenty to choose from. Enough variation between hot and cold food. If you're staying a couple of nights like we did, you won't get tired of the buffet because you can easily make something different every day. The downside of the hotel is the entrance ! The reception is one floor below entrance level of the hotel, with no lift to gown down. Not a problem when you're young and able to carry all your luggage but this can be difficult if you are elderly and have problems carrying heavy luggage.

Also, we were far enough from the elevator that we didn't hear internal noise, either. But a note on the elevator: It is, indeed, tiiiiiiny.

I found the hotel clean, pleasant and with an excellent buffett breakfast. The only problem that i found , was that there was no plug for the sink in the bathroom. No problem, i am only here for two nights. I came back a week later and stopped in a different room on the second floor. Well blow me down there was no plug for the sink again! Irritated and curious i went to the reception and mentioned this problem, and i was informed THAT THERE WAS NO PLUGS IN THE ENTIRE HOTEL! i kid you not. From here, the male receptionist bent down and produced for me, a plug with a 12 inch chain on it and gave it to me. (I duly returned the plug when i paid my bill a few days later when i left the hotel). If i had not stopped in 2 seperate rooms at the hotel on 2 different occasions, the plug situation would not have come to light because i think everyone of us would have put up with the inconvenience for a few days as it is so trivial a complaint. Also one problem to be aware of is that the hotel reception is not at street level. The reception is down at basement level - with no lift and you therefore have to manhandle your bags down the stairs to the reception. Also on checking out of the hotel you then have the same problem. You then have to manhandle bags up to street level. i saw one or two elderly people struggle a little with their bags. Having said all of the above, i wouldn't hesitate to stay there again at the hotel.

None of the doors was broken or even scratched, the hotel used a keycard system for the opening of the doors, so the one that entered had to be someone that knew that and that could gain acces to more than 10 rooms with a simple keycard. Needless to say that the hotel never gave us any money as insurance policy and they refuse to disscount the price of the stolen goods from the price of the stay. It was a horrible horrible experience to feel so vulnerable, and also to feel that the people in your own hotel who should be the ones that have insurance and pay you for the stolen goods, may be the ones that entered to your room in the first place.

In fact, I am surprised by some of the negative reviews about this hotel - and really do wonder what exactly these people expect from a hotel that is such a good price in a prime location in a fairly pricey European city!! If you want perfection, I'm afraid you're going to have to pay a bit more than this place costs! The location was absolutely perfect for exploring Madrid - we went everywhere on foot and all the major sights were very quick and easy to get to from the Hotel - it was no more than about a 10 minute walk for us to get from the hotel to any of the top attractions in the old city area. We had the pleasure of meeting a lovely man on reception when we arrived very early (midnight-ish) on Saturday morning (Antonio, I think his name was..? He was missing a couple of fingers on each hand..). He was so friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble, and he quickly pulled out a map and started showing us all sorts of things to see, suggested walking routes, etc - including local tips and inside knowledge! He was one of the best reception staff we've come across - even better than some 5 star hotels. Our room on the 4th floor was very spacious, spotlessly clean, and because we had asked for a quiet room (as we usually do), we didn't have any problems with noise at all (besides, even if we had heard the street noise outside, we probably would've expected it, having chosen a basic hotel in such a central location!). We had a comfortable bed, lots of space in our room and bathroom, excellent and very quiet air-conditioning, and a brilliant shower with extremely good pressure. Ok, so the decor was a little dated, but for the price it was great value for money, very comfortable and functional, and realistically we didn't expect it to be overly flash given the price! The only (minor) negative was that it seemed it was necessary to take one of the two lifts to get to and from reception (and therefore in and out of the front entrance), and because they were tiny and a bit touchy, it meant waiting for the lift a little more than you would usually. It wasn't actually a terribly long wait and it didn't bother us, but if you were a bit impatient you might care more than we did. Given that we headed out in the morning and then only came back to get freshened up before dinner - we were too busy out exploring the city - so it really wasn't a problem. We think this hotel was perfectly good value for money.

Although it was noisy, that was not a big deal because both me and my girl friend are heavy sleepers. The Gran Via is also one of the busiest streets in the city so you have to expect that. And if it would ever get too loud you can just close the window. The double bed was two twin beds pushed together which was kind of annoying because their are wood floors so the beds would always separate when we would get intimate. This was initially annoying but me and my girlfriend actually thought it was funny and we made the best out of it so it was perfectly fine. That was probably the only bad thing about the room. The bathroom was great. The staff were very nice even though we forgot our passports.

But that is where the positives end. You walk in through a door directly on the street and down into a basement reception where you meet the slowest staff. When you have finally managed to check in, you then make your way past the 70's finished lounge area and up in one of the 2 lifts. Now I say lifts, 1 of them holds 4 (Kate Moss, Nicole Richie, Paris and Karen Carpenter perhaps). The other holds 3 (or 1 in old money). When you get to your room, you will find tired, 70's styling and poor quality beds and furnishings (I broke the chair when I sat on it). The trip back to the street takes you past the floor where you should get out of the lift, back to reception where you then walk back up the stairs to the street. An attempt by stairs takes you to an emergency exit into an alley. The internet access that I had paid for 24hrs on ran out after 2, reception did not answer the phone and the thought of a trip in the lift to the brains on reception was too much for me. I went to bed. Incidentally, I had to restore all my internet settings the day after to stop my browser bringing the hotel's login screen up. No doubt the receptionist wrote the code. At night, the noise of the police directing traffic outside with whistles stops about 2am. The relative silence is then broken throughout the night by the noisiest plumbing I have ever heard. When my room neighbour got up at 5am for a shower and presumably to get ready for an early start, that was it. Oh, and it cost me 202GBP for a night's stay.

I have just read the reviews on this hotel and cannot believe what I have been reading. I have been to many, many hotels worldwide. This one really takes the biscuit! Firstly we were told that this was a four star hotel. Absolutley no way!!! I would rate this no more than a TWO Star at best and only because of the location. Where do I start? Well the carpets and curtains are very very dirty - actually no they were filthy, the nets had NEVER been washed! They were dark grey. The Fridge,TV, Telephone, safe etc were outdated by a decade. The beds were very very low. The toilet had a WC, Sink, Bath and bidet all contained in a 7X6 room which ment you would have to brush past the bidet and sink to get to the toilet. If you are taller than 4'11\" then forget sitting on the toilet - you just have to do your business standing up or just use the bath! The sink had a couple of specks of blood in it. The good points are; the bed surprisingly comfortable (although I couldnt bear to change into my night clothes) and the location is fantastic. Reception is good. There are two incredibly small lifts, one holds 3 persons, the other 4. Take it from me if you are used to 3, 4 or 5 star hotels - do not stay here. If you are used to 1 or 2 stars (or a cardboard box under a bridge) then this hotel will be adequate (just!).", "Date": "February 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cAbove-average 3 star hotel\u201d", "Author": "makkuo", "ReviewID": "UR4414109", "Content": "The hotel room was reasonably clean and tidy, although small. The receptionist was also helpful. The location is very central, right on Gran Via, and only a short walk to Calle de Precaidos (a pedestrianised shopping street) towards Puerta del Sol. I was given a room without any view (only a wall behind the curtains), but the good thing is that it's away from the main street so I was able to get some sleep. If you are traveling with elderly people, you may have to think twice about staying here. The main entrance has a set of stairs leading down to the receptionist. The bell boy had to help carry my bags to my room. This is actually the first time in which I have to pay to use the safe in my room (1 Euro). They are usually free. The telephone wasn't touch tone so I wasn't able to connect to certain telephone lines which required me to \"press 1 for English...2 for...\". There wasn't any tea maker in the room so I couldn't get any hot water to drink.

Two weeks prior to the trip, I got an e mail with the Solemia web specials. The Tryp Hotel group is part of that company. They were offering 30 Euro a night room (USD$36) for 2 people in mid-October. I booked 3 nights since the hotel was on Gran Via. The Gran Villa is like a Times Square area. Very busy. Central location. It's a 5 minute walk to Puerta de Sol. That's a main tourist point. The museums are a 15 minute walk. I wasn't expecting very much for the price. You can imagine my surprise when I opened the door to the room and was greeted with a 4* room. Room 408 faced the side street. The room size was 12 x 15. Two double beds pushed together. All tile floor. Bathroom was all marble and spacious. Good towels. This could have been a Hilton or Sheraton if there was carpeting. The bathroom had all the ammeneties a major hotel chain would offer. Water pressure in the shower was outstanding. At this price breakfast buffet was not included. Otherwise the cost is 9 euros a person. You can eat locally for 2 to 3 euros or more. Internet access at the lobby computer for 2 Euros for 30 minutes. Plenty of internet access locally between 1 and 3 Euro an hour. Elevators are typically European. Small.

Where do I begin? The bathroom and bedroom were literally crumbling apart. There was dry rot all around the tub & door. At night, the hotel turned off the air conditioner and since the hotel was located in the heart of Madrid, you couldn't sleep with a window open because of the noise. During siesta, we couldn't rest or relax through the \"sounds of renovation\" (pounding of the hammers and grinding of drills). Our blackout curtains were worthless; ripped, falling apart and held up by 2 safety pins (ours). The beds reminded me of staying with my grandparents. \"It was a perfectly good bed in 1940 when we bought it!\" Our room looked like it hadn't been painted since 1940 as well. Last but not least, there are 2 elevators for this entire hotel. That makes sense. About the only thing going for this place is its central location.

The rooms are nothing wonderful, but adequate and the bathrooms are small. Couldn't work out the room safes - I kept losing my Euro coins. There was a degree of noise at night from the traffic.
