So, what do you have to expect from a Hotel in Istanbul to set your expectations correctly? I will list some categories that seem to be important for me and that the reader can also understand why I would definitely recommend to stay there: 1. VALUE for money: +++ outstanding (difficult to find another hotel with so many advantages for that money) 2. FRIENDLINESS of hotel staff and RELIABILITY of recommendations: +++ outstanding 3. SAFETY (location): ++ very good (it's not a bunker, but there is a police station in walking distance) 4. ROOM QUALITY: + good (you simply must cut back expactions a little bit when you stay in Turkey or you must chose a hotel where you have to pay the same what you have to pay in western European countries, which I would say starts at 120,-\u00e2\u201a\u00ac/night which is more than twice of what you pay at the Turvan; I already stayed at several hotels like NH or Radisson in different European countries and I will still recommend the Turvan, because everything is either there what you need - although sometimes with little flaws - or they will arrange something for you) 5. BOOKING: +++ outstanding (very good internet site in multiple languages where you can see 360 degree pics of the hotel (inside and outside) 6. PICK UP SERVICE from/to the airport: +++ outstanding (If you are for the first time in Turkey don't let you fool by some of the Taxi drivers, I would really recommend that you use the pick up service and this person will take care of you and bring you safely to the hotel. Most Taxi drivers will not speak English or German, so I would not recommend to take a Taxi unless you're able to speak Turkish, at least not when you just arrived in Istanbul for the first time like me. See also www.turkeytravelplanner.com) 7. MISCELLANIOUS: good breakfast; they have a traditional Turkish bath (\"Hamam\") and a Sauna; the cleaning stuff fills up everything if it's empty; placed in street with nice restaurants; only 5-10 minutes by foot to reach the ferryboat docking stations to Kadik\u00c3\u00b6y and \u00c3\u0153sk\u00c3\u00bcdar; very good \"strategical\" place to start sightseeing trips; vivid place, so there are many tourists in the district of Emin\u00c3\u00b6n\u00c3\u00bc and you can feel safe; the hotel staff can help to organize sightseeing tours or there is also an agency directly in Emin\u00c3\u00b6n\u00c3\u00bc that is recommended by www.turkeytravelplanner.com) Overall it's a good place to stay.

Decided to see Istanbul so we booked Turvan so called hotel over internet for two nights.Being in the location in the very center of the old part of town we knew it would be a little tacky to find a car parking, but we did.Entering Turvan we still did not have a single clue what awaits us in rooms.I assumed it was logical that the hotel cant be spacious because of the close tight packed houses in the area and I had no problem with that.But the lobby is where civilisation ends in this hotel. Our two teenage sons had their room one floor up above our room.The moment I entered our room I got a moldy aroma knock out in the face. The room is very small. but thats not nearly anything in comparison to the rest. The covers are suspicious, one of them dirty, the curtains dirty and dusty, the electricity socket for tv dangling. the fridge door with the water in it, dirty. When I stepped into the bathroom I almost collapsed, the air was nowhere - it was mold, mold and mold in 100% concentration. The water handle for the toilette was broke and connected with a wire to the watering mechanism. The electricity socket pulled out of the wall clinging with some wires that could be seen. the glass shelf on the wall above the bassin dirty, and finally the bath tub damaged and dirty, the edge around it slimy and moldy and dirty, the bathtub cabin door dirty and moldy. Couple of minutes later there was an electricity black out problem in our and some other rooms, which the lobby man jumbled out with the safety fuses, only that after twenty minutes later the same problem occured again. By that time I was furious and desperate and on the edge of an allergic seizure due to mold. We decided to sleep in that night but to leave tomorrow. We couldnt find vacant rooms anywhere around in hotels in the vicinity although there was a lot of them and they mostly looked fair enough, paradise compare to Turvan. We didnt want to eat breakfast in there tomorrow morning, but just out of curiousity I went to see the dining area. It looked like it was decent , up to the point when I raised my head and saw that a part of the ceiling around the ventilation , just above one of the dining tables was torn off due to water flooding on the above floor. Dirt and parts of the ceiling composition was hanging high up over peoples heads and one that didnt look could easily sit under that and have the parts of THAT fall into his plate and food.Luckily there were some wonderful bakeries with lots of great pastry and coffees in the proximity, so we went out there, sat and had civilized breakfast. The Topkapi and the Agia Sofia are very close by, so we went to see the places, had lunch after that and unfortunately started off back home, since we had nowhere to spend the other night, and we didnt want to do that in Turvan. They didnt want to give our money back, so practicaly, we payed for two nights while staying only one night in there. And maybe thats how they rip off people, a very (un)subtle way to rob tourists. I dont require luxury, I do very well with tight places, but its the dirt and the collapsing building of Turvan that simply made the last drop in a full glass.

The manager would not give us a phone nor would he send anyone to mop the bathroom floor. We used all the towels to dry the floor and deposited them outside our room where they remained through the night. On check out due to our confusion re: currency conversion management knowingly overcharged us $24. They did nothing to rectify the error. The very real problems we encountered and the non service management style negated the fact that the beds were clean and the wait staff friendly.", "Date": "November 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Location": "2", "Value": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "DUNDEE", "Title": "\u201cbuilding site\u201d", "Author": "BONNIE1952", "ReviewID": "UR18293855", "Content": "turvan should not be called a hotel i had to walk the plank across a ditch to get in. when showed my room i justed looked and aked about the room that was showed on the internet. there was no tv the fridge didnt work and i cant describe the bathroom. i asked for another room i was shown 3 others all in a different state of repair. the last one i couldnt even lock the door as they had taken the facings off the door. i went walk about in the sultanhmet and found another hotel.", "Date": "July 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreat experience\u201d", "Author": "stoor79", "ReviewID": "UR18129215", "Content": "We stayed here for two nights after leaving another hotel. Had a great experience. The staff was great, great location (less than 10 minute walk from aya sofia, blue mosque, seacoast, and other attractions). Close to the metro line too. The breakfast was very good and lots of selections of meats, cheeses, spreads, jams, breads, etc. More than enough before starting out into Istanbul for the day. Rooms were air conditioned and very clean, had no problems. Had a great experience and would (and will) book this hotel again.

The hotel reception staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was very basic and clean with a small TV and empty fridge. The sheets weren't changed during our stay. The bathroom was small but provided for the basic needs. We found that it could have been better cleaned with a bit more effort. We struggled with the hotel to get toilet paper and it took them a long time to provide us with any everytime we asked for it (every night). The towels in the bathroom were not very clean and we had to request them to provide clean towels. Good breakfast with a slection of cheeses, spreads and great olives. Very central location in Sultanahmet close to all the major attractions and the tram and ferry stations. Numerous kebab shops and eateries nearby. An excellent sweet shops (baklavari) just around the corner. Overall we enjoyed our stay and got what we had expected for the cheap price we have paid for the room.", "Date": "May 6, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Turvan", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d656994-Reviews-Turvan-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$59 - $98*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Hoca pasa Sokak No 36</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Sirkeci</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Istanbul</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">34112</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Turkey</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "656994", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/35/bb/c6/turvan-hotel.jpg"}}
