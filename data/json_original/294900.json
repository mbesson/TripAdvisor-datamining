The hotel itself is in a great location, close to Ataturk International Airport and on the Marina. Its an old hotel but big rooms and as I was in an unusual cold snow storm all the rooms were very warm.

The rooms were not clean, there was no room service even though there is suppose to be. They had coffee making facilities but no coffee, sugar etc even after we requested it several times. It took 3 days for them to provide coffee etc. We booked two rooms, my kids were with out sheets, pillows and blankets for 2 nights. No discount to us for having a room with no bed made up. They are suppose to change the sheets every three days - not changed once the whole time we were there (6 days). BEWARE of the cleaners, they close the door when they are in your room and rummage through your suitcases, unfortunately for my daughter, who hid her ring inside her suitcase that was closed, was STOLEN. We have travelled everywhere and never once has anything being stolen. This left us with such a bitter taste in our mouths and ruined our experience in Istanbul. When we asked for the police to be notified they said they would sort it out - they didn't so we lodged a report with the police and checked out a day earlier.

I will never stay here again, you can be sure of that. First, it is only ten or fifteen minutes from the Istanbul Airport, but on such an out-of-the-way croner of the airport area that the taxi driver couldn't find it. I kept telling him it was near the Sheraton (I googled the location and it is adjacent to that 40-story landmark on the same street!) but he was sure it was someplace else. This is the kind of stress a frequent traveller just doesn't need -- arguing with a Turkish taxi driver in the middle of the night in a language you don't understand. Take me to the Marriott, I should have said. The lobby is small, dark and dingy. The staff was disinterested and untrained. It fook four of them to check me in and -- amazingly -- could not get my platinum AMEX card to be approved. It needed a PIN, they said, which of course an AMEX never does. So I had to put it on a different card, which really annoyed the heck out of me. The price was about US$150, which I tolerated because it's supposed to be next to the airport and airport hotels are always pricey. But this was a terrible value. After the desulatory check-in process, the bellhop grabbed my bags and took me DOWN a small flight of stairs to the world's smallest elevator to go UP to our room. It was so small my wife refused to get in it, and walked up the stairs to the room. We chugged up in the lift and she still managed to beat us there. The hallways are dark and dreary. The room was large enough, but heavily worn. The TV was old and had very few channels (it did have CNN and BBC). There was a tiny balcony for our ocean view, but we couldn't see any ocean, not with radar or even the Hubble Telescope. Most annoyingly, we could not get the shower to work, so we had to splash some water on ourselves and call it clean. (While we're on the subject... bad plumbing really lights my rocket. I have three college degrees and am a commercial pilot. You think i'd be able to figure out how to use a shower, right? So that device (see photo) either was broken or so frozen by years of hard water that it didn't work. Or I'm an idiot -- which is always a possibility, I will agree -- but it shouldn't take an engineering degree to get hot water!) Anyhow, we had a drink in the empty Anchor Bar at the hotel, served by a very nice young man who was desperate for a customer (or even some company). We looked into the hotel restaurant and retreated instantly -- ptomaine poisoning lurked on the menu I am sure. We finally found dinner by walking behind the hotel to the marina and there was a very nice fish restaurant there. Perfect. The only good thing that happened at this hotel, and it happend away from it. So save your pennies and go to the Sheraton. Even your taxi driver will thank you for it.", "Date": "August 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Trondheim, Norway", "Title": "\u201cOverprice\u201d", "Author": "Paldrevl", "ReviewID": "UR117159437", "Content": "Old rooms, no air condition.

Reality does not match the description on the website of the hotel. Perhaps, once this was really the hotel category 4 stars, but since that much time has passed. Bathroom is small and looks very old. Fixing shower fixes bad, setting water temperature is like to impossible - hot replaces cold and vice versa. Toilet noise for about 20 minutes after washout. There is nothing more than liquid soap and a terrible shower gel (both in containers attached to the wall). All additional cosmetics have to ask at the reception - but in this case they havent shampoo or shower gel, only cotton buds and shawing set. In my room was not working teapot (was not plugged into an outlet - directly into the electricity network). Mechanism for closing the blinds was broken, on the floor was pieces of hardware. Balcony door closes poorly. Large-size bed, pillows enough. In general, the room is large and could be useful. Wi Fi works poorly - is often lost the signal, or the connection becomes slow. Internet access for a day costs 10 liras (5 euros). However, the business center and internet speed is even worse. Restaurant and room service pretty decent. Everything is delicious, the restaurant is large and clean, service is quick and attentive. Breakfast is quite varied and tasty. The hotel's location is convenient in terms of distance from the airport. Transfer to the airport by 5 to 9 am, and after 14 pm. There is a shuttle service to the city center (2 times a day).
