Opposite the road is a little restaurant, cocktail bar, takeaway pizza place, ice cream bar - all great value. Parenti Patisserie was a god send - 1 euro a coffee and 1 euro for a little taste of heaven cake. Great value stay! Warning - Old lift that hold two people and one suitcase maximum! Ok to walk down the stairs but its on floor 5 (I think) of historic building so not good for the wheelchair user. A great base for tourists wanting to explore the city.

(The large sunlit windows in the photos of the Ottaviano hotel were what attracted us there in the first place.) The bottom line is this: There have been far too many similar instances noted in these reviews to believe it is an isolated occurence. Unless the Suites di Via Ottaviano are in much poorer condition that they appear from the photos, it is unlikely there are such frequent problems with bathrooms. Perhaps all the switches are due to overbooking. Since there were positive aspects to the alternate room we were given, I suggest that If you book this hotel, do so knowing that you may be switched at the last minute to an entirely different location due to \"problems with the rooms\". Since I did not get in the building of Le Suites di Via Ottaviano, I can't comment on the property other than perhaps the booking practices. The Asian man who brought us breakfast each morning was nice and helpful as could be and overall, it was a very good value for Rome.", "Date": "May 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cWatch out\u201d", "Author": "Johnson25", "ReviewID": "UR12845520", "Content": "We booked the 4poster room for 4 nights.

This hotel was clean, comfortable and looked like it had a higher rating than Le Suite, so no complaints! Good points about our stay: Staff: Extremely friendly and helpful, providing lots of advice on what to see and do and how to get around the city. Room: A good size, with a great view of the papal residence. Comfortable bed. Clean. Ensuite shower room with a hydro therapy shower. The room had a TV, phone, fridge and safe. There seemed to be air conditioning but as it was November, we didn't need it. Location: Great for the Vatican. Other tourist attractions could be reached on foot, we walked everywhere. The hotel is well located for the metro, buses and trams though as well. There is a cash point right outside, with shops and restaurants in the surrounding streets. The area seemed very safe and was fairly quiet at night. The hotel is quite easy to find, it is one of the first buildings on the left as you turn into Via dei Gracchi (off Via Ottaviano). Breakfast: Plenty to eat, fresh pastries, big cups of coffee, plus juice, yoghurts and toast-like biscuits. Breakfast is served at the time of your choice in the room as the hotel does not have a kitchen or dining room. A few things to consider: If you are tall or of bigger build, you may struggle with the bed, which was quite short and the small shower cubicle. The hotel has a lift, so access is fine. There were steps to be careful of inside the bathroom. There was a smell of drains in the otherwise clean bathroom. There is quite a lot of road noise because of the location, with trams starting to run quite early in the morning.

I found it really difficult to find a hotel in rome, there was so much choice, I didn't know what area to stay in etc. I don't even rememeber how I stumbled across this hotel (booked it through laterooms.com in the end) but like the previous reviewer, it seemed to be relatively cheap (compared to the prices of hotels that would be classed as more central ie close to the Trevi fountain etc) and had very good reviews. I was very pleasantly suprised when I arrived. The hotel is in a big building, but the hotel itself is very very small. I'm sure there's only about 5 rooms! I think I would have had difficulty locating it had we not been dropped off right outside the door by the taxi! (We used Rome cabs-very good service) Angelo, the hotels owner is very very friendly and makes you feel very welcome straight away. He helped us with our luggage, then spent 15-20 minutes going through how to use the metro/buses, how much taxis should cost, where the good restaurants were in the area etc. We had booked a superior room, which was lovely. To be honest I had a quick sneaky peek in the room next door when the door was open and it didnt really seem any different to ours. Our room definitley had the best view which in itself would be worth paying the extra money for. We had the corner room which looked right out onto the papal residence in the Vatican. It was so close, literally a fewminutes walk to St Peters, or a few minutes walk the other way to the entrance to the Vatican Museums. Our room was very nice, not huge, but I have definitley stayed in smaller in city centres. It was always very clean and the bathroom was very modern with a fancy shower which sprayed from all angles!! Breakfast in your room is nothing to shout about, a croissant and drink of your choice. It did me fine though, as you eat like a pig for the rest of the day-you cant help it when in Rome!! I was a bit worried that staying on the other side of the Tiber, close to the Vatican was going to mean that we were far away form everything else. I was pleasantly suprised at how easy it was to get anywhere from our hotel. It was quite a long walk, admittedly, but the whole time we were there we walked everywhere and never used the underground or the buses. The longest walk we took was to the colliseum which took just over an hour. Overall I would say this is a very nice, charming and friendly hotel in an excellent location.

The reviews were accurate. Room was clean, as was the bathroom. Some rooms have bathtubs, and others have showers. We got a room with a shower, but it was not facing the street, so it was very quiet. The location to the Vatican is perfect (a 10 minute easy walk). It is a 4 minute walk to the Metro (subway), which takes you wherever you want to go in Rome (will get you to all the tourist sites). They bring you a Continental Breakfast in your room (you tell them the time), and all the beverages, etc. in the refrigerator were less expensive than you could find in the street). This is a small thing, but it is nice when a hotel does not rip you off for the mini bar. Upon your arrival you are greeted at the door of the Hotel (4th floor of a commercial/residential building (don't worry it has an elevator). I should also note that it was very easy to get to the Hotel via the Metro from the Rome Termini Train Station (Romes main train station). If you have alot of luggage, you will be better off taking a taxi (we did not have alot of luggage). In summary, if you are looking for a clean, secure location to stay (not to hang out at, but to get a good nights sleep and \"get out to the sites everyday.\" This is a good choice. If you are looking for a place to hangout, there is no lobby, breakfast room, or any other place to stay except in your room, so this would not be the place for you. Also, you cannot dial out for local calls on the phones in the rooms, so you will need to use their phone in their little office near the entrance. Simply ask them, and they will let you use it.

The suites were ideally located, within a one minute walk to the Vatican and a two minute walk to the train stop that will take you to all the other sites in Rome. It will take you about 20/30 minutes to walk to the centre of Rome, and I'd recommend doing it - you see so much more of the city this way.
