There were people cleaning the hotel all day long, mopping, raking, etc and it showed. The hotel is old and it is not fancy at all but for the price, you could do much worse in Playa del Carmen. All of the rooms on are the first floor which was great for my parents. We had a fridge for snacks and beverages, a decent bed and a fairly large room. There are 2 coffee places within a block and a number of good restaurants. 100% Natural is across the street and has great food if odd service. Babe's is around the corner for excellent Thai food. There is a strange situation with the towels. They really need to be replaced and there seemed to be a shortage. If I return to this hotel I guess I would bring my own towels, not ideal. The ladies who work here are extremely nice. They were professional, friendly and always tried to help us with anything we needed. If you don't need anything fancy, this could be your place.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cDecent budget hotel\u201d", "Author": "Alan C", "ReviewID": "UR125864602", "Content": "Few frills but the staff were nice, the price was right and the location is very central. The towel situation was a bit disappointing, they were a bit shabby and we had none in the room when we first checked in (did eventually get them) and one day one of them wasn't replaced by the cleaning staff. It was hanging in the bathroom, maybe they just missed it. Good basic accommodation with pool and wifi and friendly staff. Not an upscale place and their prices reflect that, but a decent value. You can easily pay more for a worse room in Playa.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Honolulu, Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Service!\u201d", "Author": "MicahN", "ReviewID": "UR125052518", "Content": "Booking with hotel Azul by Encanto has been my luckiest find one of my many vacations that I take each year. First, the location couldn't have been any better than this, right in the heart of 5th avenue. Close to the bus and ferry terminal, Starbucks, nightlife, shopping and especially the beach. Everything you need is near and here! We took the ADO bus to most of the main attractions such as Chichen Itza, Tulum, and Cancun etc... We dropped our laundry off one block away for $6usd (20libs!) and picked it up in the same day!. The room is simple, air conditioned, with a safe, free wifi, and VERY helpful and friendly service in English (which is all we needed on vacation)... Our rooms were serviced every day and my favorite was the complimentary bottle of water. I used the rooftop to do my daily exercises as there is no gym but an open quiet area where one could train or do yoga before starting their day. There is also a spa within the hotel with set hours of operation where you can get a special for $50usd for 2 people, 1 hour each. Well, don't want to bore you with all the other details, but if you are looking for a SIMPLE, affordable location, with friendly service, Hotel Azul is it! All my expectations were satisfied tremendously with this hotel and I would return and I would recommend this place to my parents and friends as well as you who are looking for a similar experience. Hope you enjoy as much as I did.. :-)", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat Price and Location\u201d", "Author": "Andrew1331", "ReviewID": "UR124915114", "Content": "We ventured out to PDC from Cancun and picked this place based on the GREAT location on 5th ave. and the cheap price we found online (you will have to book online as the lady at the desk can not price match) As for the room and hotel, I would compare it to a Motel 6 or Super 8 quality... maybe a half step down. Room smelled musty, everything was clean enough but definitely run down. The room was a decent size but there were no amenities at all to speak of. My wife was halfway through a shower when we realized there were no towels in the room. The lady at the desk could not help me as the towels were \"in the wash\" So I had to go haggle for one at the souvenir store down the street. She was, however, able to produce a hair dryer. Not much else to say. If you don't plan on spending any time at all in your hotel room, this is the room for you.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Louis, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cClean Comfortable & Quiet,.. but absolutely no charm whatsoever!\u201d", "Author": "walkfootman", "ReviewID": "UR120664625", "Content": "My room was very large and spotless! There was a queen sized bed with a very comfortable mattress and a single bed in the room with random light bulbs on the ceiling and a TV that was fuzzy on all channels. No mirror or toilet paper holder in the bathroom. Amazingly quiet, considering that it occupies a courtyard just behind the busy 5th avenue pedestrian street crowded with trendy restaurants and stores. Just three blocks from beach. The location is superb! You can't beat the price at $32 US for a large clean air conditioned room with a comfortable bed and lots of warm water for your shower (but you'll have to wait a few minutes before it arrives...be patient!) If old world Mexican charm is what your looking for, spend a little more elsewhere. The pool was clean but about the size of a large bathtub plunked in the middle of a scrubby grass and dirt courtyard with a few attempts at planting. An unfinished concrete deck loomed above with a few plastic chairs. At the price, you can't beat this hotel. It's a great place to sleep. But when you open your eyes in the morning, you realize that you're on vacation and the reason you're here is to get away from your miserable life and saturate your senses with tropical foliage and an explosion of color. This hotel gives you none of that. The front desk staff was delightful and helpful. The property was absolutely safe and secure, since there's a single entrance and always someone on duty at the front desk. So, I absolutely recommend it, if all you're looking for is a cheap and comfortable place to sleep. Come to think of it,.. that's not bad, is it?", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Azul", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150812-d1380372-Reviews-Hotel_Azul-Playa_del_Carmen_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "Price": "$49 - $101*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">5ta avenida entre calles 10 y 12</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Playa del Carmen</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">77710 </span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Mexico</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1380372", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/33/ca/33ca1d043e5d6ebde6d742843c6b83491large.jpg"}}
