The hotel lobby and common area were very nice, clean and modern as were the lifts and the corridors, the rooms however, were a more old fashioned victorian design which didn't quite fit with the overall scheme of the hotel. A major problem was the smell, the odour didn't hit us until we opened our room door and we later figured out that it was coming from the roof top swimming pool (very small and needed a good clean) because our room was on the top floor. Another problem was the lack of guests staying in the hotel and the roof top bar (very nice) closed early, so I would recommend anyone planning on going to Florence to go a little earlier in the summer.

The front desk's solution to this? They sprayed some air freshener. So our room stunk. And it was incredibly small. When we tried to eat out on the rooftop, the place was deserted and we couldn't find a soul to serve us, so we left. I am not a lazy person, but the location was really a little too far to walk from the Duomo and center of town. When you headed out for the day on foot, you knew you weren't making the trip back until you're ready for bed. Our room was facing a street where the garbage trucks would rummble, clank and bang down the street and jar us awake in the morning - that is, if the noise from the other guests coming through the paper thin walls didn't do it first.

The pool was pleasantly cool for being on the roof in 90 degree weather. No towels up top, so bring one from your room.

We traveled with a small group to Florence in June and experienced a few days of rain. One afternoon the rain was heavy for an hour or so and several people in our group found their rooms flooded (at no fault of their own)! The management did nothing to help these people, let alone move them or offer to compensate them for ruined items--they couldn't care less--after all, Florence is a city filled with tourists who have to stay somewhere so there is no incentive to provide good service in the hopes of gaining customer loyalty or positive word of mouth. Front desk people also failed to pass on phone messages or provide us help with our luggage.The rooms are just average--some quite small and strange, and the public spaces provide potential but never seem to be used (i.e., a bar in the lobby area and a rooftop bar). The breakfast was horrible--mostly canned, boxed and wrapped items. In a country like Italy, why do so many hotels provide canned fruit and juice concentrates? The location, while quiet, is far from the action.

The Hotel is in a rather dull part of the city, a good 20 -25 minute walk from the ideal parts. For example, the Ponte-Vecchio is about a 20 minute walk along the Arno. The main areas of the hotel are nice, but the rooms are a bit outdated, and in stark contrast to the modern and elegant decor in the front lobby. The upstairs pool was also a bit of a disappointment. It is small, cold, not the cleanest, and rather shabby with green astroturf all around. We expected a heated pool with ecclectic Italian tiling, or some sleek modern style. It is not luxurious or inviting by any means. Don't decide to stay here for the pool. Trust me. The balcony in the room was a nice feature, but the view (or lack thereof) made us opt to not use it much.The views from the rooftop are spectacular, and the best thing about the hotel. Since this hotel is a bit far away from most of the sights in Florence, I would expect the hotel to make up for it in style and service. The service was rather lukewarm. Not bad, but not great. The breakfast buffet was 3 stars, not luxury. Just ok. The rooms were reminiscient of old French hotels from the 1980's. Not sure how it got its 4 star rating.The hotel should consider renovating the rooms and upstairs pool area to match the cool lobby and front bar area.  This hotel has potential to be something great, in spite of its rather dull location.

The real bonus about this hotel is the stunning roof terrace which has views all over Florence and the hills beyond. Sitting here in the early evening with an aperitvo is what it's all about. There is also a small swimmng pool on the roof terrace - you can swim whilst looking over the rooftops and domes of Florence. We ate one night at the hotel restaurant which was superb, although you wouldn't want to eat there every night. There are plenty of trattoria nearby. THe only thing some people might find a disadvantage is that it is at least ten minutes walk from central Florence and the main sights.

We booked through Expedia.com and stayed at the Kraft hotel in April 2006 and were soon to regret the choice. We understand that usually, when booking through discount on-line sites you get the hotels worst rooms. But many of the listed room amenities for the Kraft are complete lies. Not all rooms are soundproofed. Our room faced a busy side road, on the opposite side to the river, and was noisy with the windows closed. Note: \u9225\u6e03onverted 19-century townhouse\u9225? does not mean double glazing. But the noise from the housekeeping staff, yelling at each other, and dragging furniture across wooden floors, drowns out the Vespa cacophony. But even they are no competition for the breakfast staff. Bring your ear plugs!Rooms have \u9225\u6997limate control\u9225? i.e. open a window because the \u9225\u6993ir conditioning\u9225?is not switched on. In April we experienced temperatures from a hot and humid 29 degrees Celsius, to a wet and blustery 12 degrees. Not at any time did the air conditioning work in our room. On the initial hot day I enquired with Reception how to work the climate control. I was informed that the \u9225\u69aeystem\u9225?would not turn the air conditioning on, and was told to open a window. What little noise reduction there was, disappeared. When the temperature dropped to 12 degrees during the day, again the \u9225\u69aeystem\u9225?would not turn the AC on. I don\u9225\u6a9b know about you, but the idea of \u9225\u6997limate control\u9225?is that I, the guest, have the ability to set the temperature of the room, as I like it. A plus for the room is that the bed was comfortable, but it took up much of it. A crab like walk would get you around the bottom of the bed and wall. And this was good practice for the shower. Nice as the green marble tiles were, the shower was literally closet size. Turning around in it meant scraping your shoulders on the cold walls, cosy. Yes, the roof top garden is pleasant, no water in the pool, but a great view over the city. Yes, the hotel is close to the Opera House, the river, and a brisk 10 minute walk from all the sites.

They claimed that the phones would soon be working. It took at least two days for the phones to work properly. As I had had my credit cards stolen at the Rome train station (they were in my purse which was lifted from my handbag), I needed to make quite a few phone calls. I ended up having to use my cell phone to make the calls - very expensive. Aside from this, whenever we asked for something from the reception staff, they looked bemused or annoyed and tried to get rid of us as quickly as possible. A salient example of how they treated us was the time they called us a taxi. Immediately prior to me was a young woman waiting for a taxi. She came into the lobby, and her taxi arrived outside. She stood talking to her family for a while then smiled at the reception man and told him she no longer wanted the taxi. He then gestured to me that we could have that taxi, which had been waiting for five minutes for the other woman. When we got into that cab, the meter was at 5 Euros already! The driver claimed that he had been waiting all that time and would charge for it. Of course, he had been waiting for the other woman -- not us!! Now the hotel receptionist knew very well this would happen. He had been having fun at our expense. We insisted to the driver as he drove off that we should not have to pay this amount and we made the driver turn around and return to the hotel where the receptionist reluctantly got the driver to put the meter back to 0!!The hotel itself was acceptable for the price, but the staff really made it unpleasant.

Our room was a good size and comfortable, nice furnishings, facing the main street. We found it to be a very quiet street, and in general, a quiet neighborhood. The bathroom also was a good size, with lots of counterspace. There were extra blankets and pillows in the closet which we made use of. The bed was pretty hard, but so were all the beds in hotels we stayed at in Italy, so not an issue. We did occassionally hear guests in the room above us, but it wasn't intrusive. The balcony had a small table and chairs, perfect for enjoying the beautiful weather with a glass of wine. The hotel is located in the Ognissanti area, near the Arno, and we were able to walk everywhere from the Uffizi to the Duomo and everywhere else with no trouble at all. Ognissanti is a quieter district from the tourist crowds and has several good restaurants in close distance. What really made our stay at the Kraft so nice was the excellent service. The front desk staff were so helpful and accommodating to all of our needs, genuine and friendly, as were all the staff we encountered. The breakfast was excellent, with a good assortment of meats, cheeses, breads, pastries, yogurt, cereal, juices, fruit. The large rooftop bar was a great way to relax after a day of sight seeing. We went to the hotel restaurant on our first night there, an excellent way to begin our vacation, and had one of our best meals (4 course Tuscan style chef's choice w/wine pairings). Thanks to Jonathan, the excellent restaurant manager for his attentive service; he also recommended a terrific restaurant for our anniversary. There also is a small rooftop pool and area for sun bathing. I loved Florence and the Kraft made a good home base. I would stay at the Kraft again, and at their other locations in the future.

I would not recomend this hotel. It is very shabby and run down. The bathroom was outdated and the shower was terrible. The tub was about 1 foot wide, which made showers almost impossible.

Buffet breakfast was excellent and there are many restaurants within 5-10 mins walk on both sides of the river. I'd certain stay here again.If you are going to the main museums - book in advance.
