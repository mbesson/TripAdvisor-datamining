Can't of course comment on the Eden other than the modern foyer and helpful concierge. Eden does look out onto the canal, a big plus but from the outside the windows look shabby. Hampshire has no view other than directly into an open plan office suite. Either hotel very well located just off the lovely Rembrant Plein. The number 9 tram from Central Station stand A takes you to Rembrant Plein. Our first conductor had run out of one day tickets (best value) which made the short trip on a one hour ticket more expensive \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3.60 each. If doing the very doable walk to the hotel go left out the station, cross road and head up past Newmarket. Very picturesque by the canal, very Amsterdam. If you go straight over the road from the station as you may be inclined to do as it signs 'Centre' you go up the main drag to Dam Square. Not so picturesque because of long term road works and not in view of canal. Either way Amsterdam is all very walk able and a great, entertaining city. Sitting under red lights made some interesting photos! As ever the drunk groups of Brit men an embarrassment but to be fair they gather in the most obvious places and clearly enjoy!

Fresh fruit salad (no tinned muck) fresh baked breads, danish & french pastries, selection of hams, cheeses, smoked salmon, bacon, sausages, scrambled/boiled eggs, 3 types of fresh juice kept cool on crushed ice, cereals, yogurts.... need I go on??

There are some lovely bars nearby and canal walks, restaurants and the lively Rembrandt square is on your doorstep(as the name suggests) dam square is 5-10 mins walk away too. If you are not to keen on walking everywhere there is a tram stop very near the hotel. The hotel is large and does everything in my opinion you need hotel on a city break to do....... Receptionists we met were helpful and friendly. We had a problem with our first room and we were changed immediately and upgraded foc so I can't really complain! The hotel has a lovely bar called the piano bar which is really nice to relax in at the end of the night. Our room was large clean and really modern and the bed was nice and comfortable. The only thing I didn't like was the bathroom doors which were frosted glass- I prefer a little bit more privacy!

The value was really good for the clean, quiet room with super COMFY beds and a beautiful bathroom. We stayed in 3 different rooms at this hotel in August, each time the room was quite different. One room had a shower that was glass on the other side so you could see the person showering from the bed. Very sexy to watch your partner, but I couldn't imagine what it would have been like if I was there with my family... lol. However the other 2 rooms had a private shower. Once we got lucky with a really big room with a HUGE bathroom. I was so impressed I took some photos (attached). I think it just depends on your luck, as the 3rd room was quite small, but we didn't need a big room, just something quiet, clean and comfy. This hotel was perfect. It was also nice being so close to Rembrandt Square, with live music and lots of places to sit. In the morning we'd go to Albert Hein, and the nearby cheese shop to pick up some breakfast to go and eat it in the park. We didn't pay for the hotel breakfast as there are a lot of restaraunts around the square and it's pretty easy to find food around there. It's also easy to get to from the train station by taking the number 9 bus. I wouldn't attempt walking it again with heavy bags, though.

We complained, and a person came with a bucket of soap water, and cleaned the bathroom when we were in the room. WHAT REALLY SHOCKED US, IS THAT HE USED THE SAME WASH CLOTH TO CLEAN THE BATHTUB, TOILET, SINK AND FLOOR!! Disgusting! We confronted him with this, but he did not understand English. Later that night, we found toothpaste residue in the toothbrush glass in the bathroom and water stripes on them. Cups and spoons had water stripes, clearly indicating that they clean it with at wet cloth... The same wash cloth as they clean the floor, sink and toilet with?? They don't bother change the cups and glasses when new guest arrive. Also really disgusting! We got some tea spots on the floor on the bathroom the first day when we threw the used teabag. Those visible spots stayed there for 4 nights, after showing the spots to the cleaning supervisor several times. Indicating that they don't bother clean the floor properly at all. Complaining every day is not funny, and ruins some of the vacation. And it drains you for energy. Pre paid room is not a good idea here, then they don't care at all. They did try to compensate, by giving us free breakfast the last two days. The only stupid is, that they tried to charge us this breakfast at check out. But too be nice they said, they gave us the \"free\" breakfast for free once more. Thats just annoying! The managment dont bother to give us a reply after sending them an e- mail.

The Eden fit the location and seemed to be in the mixed review category. I used credit card points for the hotel and since I did not have many options, I gave the Eden a try. First, we were told when we checked into the hotel that the only room available was two twin beds pushed together. The beds constantly moved and even swallowed my camera, after a frantic search, separating the beds made the camera drop to the ground. The dirty stained ground. The carpet was filthy, not just dirty, we are talking filthy! And there was NOTHING in the room. No pen, no paper, not even a \"do not disturb sign\". Every morning I was forced to call the desk and request no service for the day. On our last day the staff ignored our wishes and came into our room (luckily we use the safe, but what if we hadn't?) and made the bed. They did not pick up towels off the floor, or replenish them for that matter (which they were supposed to hang on the door). They did not do anything but break my privacy so they could make the bed. The desk had the note in the system and no explanation why the staff ignored the request. The thing none of the reviews mentioned was the club located right outside my window. I have lived in NYC and have never been bothered by noise, but this was LOUD!!! It lasted until 3-4am on Saturday. The icing on the cake were the soap/shampoo dispensers, as in public bathroom plastic soap dispensers in the rooms. The fact that a 4 star hotel would dare to put dispensers in the rooms is offensive enough, but then to add insult the one in our room was broken and we could barely get anything out of the dispenser before the front would fall off.

Moreover, the carpet was a damn fool mess. What looked like smudged chocolate and chocolate sauce imbued the carpet throughout the room. I dared not walk bare feet. In parts the filth had caked and cracked away from the carpet itself. I reported this to the receptionist, who told me that they were aware of the state of the carpet. In my opinion, that room was not ready for occupancy by a guest. They did not offer an alternative room. I am sure that some manager will reply on tripadvisor to apologise, like these managers tend to do. I feel that the duty of the manager is to resolve these issues by taking the appropriate action whilst the guest is occupying the room, rather than constantly expressing remorse publicly.

It's just off Rembrandt Sq but becuase it's down a side street, you get none of the noise from the square.

In this respect, this hotel falls way below the standard. On arrival, our room had been made up but there was dirt on the duvet cover - I assume that someone had been standing on it. A pair of the last guests socks were under the bed and remained there for the duration of our stay and a pen on the bathroom floor that also never moved in 3 days. Our room was serviced each day but on the first night we made tea and the used cups were not removed, nor were the tea and sugar replaced. Also in the hall ways were dirty, probably from not being vaccuumed very often. The staff were very friendly and helpful, except for 1 lady who we dealt with on check out (I presume it's the same person that everyone is talking about in this thread).

The man at the desk told me it was impossible and they were extremely busy without looking at his computer.

The bathroom was massive and had a very spacious bathtub and shower and even a wall mounted bottle opener! All the fittings were top-notch and it felt we were in a truly 5 star setting. Only a couple of drawbacks - the cleaners tended to only make the bed and not much else i.e the bins weren't always emptied, the mugs and cups weren't always cleaned and the tea and coffee wasn't re-stocked very often. Also rather than having a double bed we had two single pushed together which wasn't ideal but they were still very comfortable and luxurious. Aside from that this place is a dream and brilliant value for the money we payed. I get the feeling that even the double rooms would be to a similar standard to the one I had. Location wise the Eden Rembrandt is a 20 second walk away from Rembrandt Square which hosts a number of vibrant clubs, restaurants and a brilliant coffee shop. It also has a tram stop which gives you very, very easy access to all of Amsterdam with Tram 9 taking you straight to Dam Square and Centraal Station in minutes for next to no money (especially if you get one of the all day tourist passes). This gets you to pretty much anywhere in Amsterdam as most of the tram lines pass through Dam and Centraal. Don't forget the city tax that gets charged at the end of your stay:- it's not much.

But there was a great breakfast buffet and a small market near by that I used mostly for meals when we weren't out sight seeing.

Now, I didn't try to stay in the same room, so I have absolutely no issues with having to move rooms. In fact, it was welcomed, as our first four nights were spent in a room that had windows onto an alleyway that was incredibly loud every morning at about 3am. I guess the bar/coffeeshop patrons start to spill out into that street at that time... Our first room had stains on the carpet and holes in the bedding - a bit worn, but not unbearable. The bathroom had a tub, but only half a shower door - a design I'm not fond of! It makes for a bit of a flood every time you shower, especially with the rain feature - unless you consciously take care to not move around too much. The second room was a little smaller and didn't have a tub, but had a full door to the shower, so that's a plus. It was also much quieter - a welcomed relief at that point. My only gripe about the second room was the layer of dust on all of the shelves - the ones in the bathroom, the ones in the living area...dust! Overall, though, the beds are comfy enough and the staff were nice. The breakfast was ridiculous for 20euros - offered nothing special for that. I did really like the location of the hotel - Utrecht Straat is just out the door, where there's plenty of nice restaurants and cafes, and the market \"Marqt\" is just around the corner as well, where you can pick up fresh munchies/produce. Also, there's a coffee company next door, for your morning caffeine fix. One more thing that can balance out the negatives is that there's free internet in the room. If you can plug in with the ethernet cable they provide, it's free for the lowest speed. They charge for \"faster\" internet, but honestly, I used the free internet the whole time and had absolutely no issues loading pages. So, in the end, I'd recommend the hotel if you can get a decent rate for the stay and don't mind that it's slightly worn out.", "Date": "September 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic\u201d", "Author": "MissS80", "ReviewID": "UR78629608", "Content": "I have just returned from a two nights stay here.

The other room, the one where the cheese, cold meats, scrambled eggs, bacon & mini sausages lived, served breakfast for the kingly sum of 19.50 Euros. Alas, the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfree\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 breakfast was the 12.50 pair of croissants and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have to pay the difference if I wanted to eat a half decent breakfast. I say half decent because even at 19.50 it was hardly something to remember. It was barely worth the difference, let alone the full 19.50! As if the rip-off breakfasts & \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcFree\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 breakfast con trick wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite annoying enough, the hotel also charges top whack for internet access, 15 euros for 24 hours or 7.50 per hour. Jesus. When I checked out, my breakfast upgrades for the two nights and my, approximately, 3 hours total internet use landed me a bill for an additional 37.50 euros. This place is a complete rip-off! But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, and this next one I hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t picked up on initially but I got chatting to another guest on my second day at the hotel. He complained that the staff were unfriendly but after I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d thought hard about my interactions thus far with the staff I realised he was onto something. I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say they were unfriendly though, I would say they were unhappy. They were polite every time I spoke to them but there was no warmth, not between myself and the staff, not between the staff and each other. A stark contrast to the Owl Hotel I stayed at the week before where the staff are all so happy and so friendly you enjoy stopping for chats with them. Anyway, back to the Eden if we must. The layout of the hotel is pretty confusing which is ok if the signs are adequate\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a bit hit & miss and I struggled to find my room initially. I also made the mistake of using the lift to get my case up to the second floor and man was it slow, it was more like waiting for a tram than a lift\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6it was just as slow when I used it again to check out 2 days later (I used the stairs in between because there are better things to do in Amsterdam than wait for lifts at the Eden).

However, if you are price conscious, or demand some class and good accommodations for your money, I would look elsewhere. Overall, the hotel tries very hard to appear expensive, but comes off as cheap and overpriced. When I arrived on Friday, there was water dripping onto my head in the lobby. When I left on Sunday, the water leak was still not repaired. The rooms are small but serviceable, but no more. The large beds are really two smaller beds pushed together, with separate bedding on each. Each room has a very small desk with a small, uncomfortable chair. Above each bed, on the wall, is painted a very large arrow pointing to the bed, in case you are unable to find it. In fact, you may be unable to find the bed if, like me, you let the door close before turning on the electricity in the room. In order for any electric device to work - all lights included - you must insert your room key into a slot inside the room near the door. However, to see the slot, you must hold the door open at the same time! There isn't even a tiny night light above the slot to help you if you happen to let the door close, leaving you to fumble around until you open the door again or figure out where the slot is. There is free Internet access, provided via Ethernet. Short but adequate cables are provided in the room. If you want wireless access, you will have to rely on being lucky and picking up a signal from an establishment outside of the hotel. My room had several strange, bright orange stains on the carpet. The heating system was very weak and took a lot of time to bring the room to a reasonable temperature. The walls were very thin, and it was easy to hear what others were up to on each side of me. The bathroom. My nemesis. Someone decided that it would be fun to make a fancy looking shower, I suppose. The floor drain is right in the middle of the tub; I kept stepping on it accidentally and closing it, causing the tub to fill with water. It took me a while to figure out where the handle was to open the drain up again - there are no markings. The emergency drain is the key here, but I opted to simply pull the plug out entirely, since I kept stepping on the thing. Instead of bar soap, a liquid soap dispenser (similar to the kind you would find in a typical restroom) is placed inside of the shower and near the sink. This is a great idea, but poor in execution. The amount of soap dispensed with each push is minuscule; much of my soap also was caught inside of the enclosure, due to improper soap nozzle alignment. A word of warning before turning on the water in the shower: Turning the nozzle one way is for the bath, while the other is for the attached shower hose. No indication of which direction is for which device, or that the dual-function even exists. The shower door only covers half the length of the shower. I am not sure why. If alone, this is obviously not a problem, but if you are sharing the room while one showers and another shaves, for example, do not expect much in the way of privacy. Heated mirrors prevent condensation during showers. A very nice and unexpected touch. You will hear what is going on inside of the Square. It can be quite noisy, long into the night, and every night I heard at least two ambulances nearby. If noise bothers you and inhibits your sleeping, DO NOT under any circumstances stay in this hotel!

The Canal Busses are a great way to explore the city (and the canals), the best value ones seemed to be the hop-on hop-off ones which are reasonably priced at 20 Euros per day.

The bathroom ( with its glass door) had been refurbished. Whoever was responsible should be taken out & shot. They have a very small towel rail, which could hold a single hand towel, but not 4 towels.

If you are fit you can walk to most Amsterdam attractions and enjoy the nice routes along the canals.

It is very convenient that the Eden has an entrance from the Square and another one from the Amstel (river) side. Inside the hotel seems to be large though I have no idea how many rooms it has. The room I had was on the 2nd floor facing a wall of another building, it was quite outside. As often happens the room doors were heavily springed and banged loudly each time someone enters a room in the corridor, so guests returning late at night kept waking me up. Inside the room was small as all Amsterdam hotel rooms are I gather but cosy and clean. There is a kettle and some instant coffee and tea bags available. The bathroom is shiny and a nice set of shampoo, creams and wahtever is waiting for you in a transparent airport-security-friendly plastic bag.

We had a superior room which was large and very spacious with a mini bar, tea/coffee making facilities, flat screen tv and internet access; the bed was extremely comfortable which was a god send for a sleepless night! The one thing that I did find un-nerving was the partially frosted bathroom door - not great if you get stage fright. The bathroom itself was nice and modern with hairdryer, bottle opener and a phone! The shower was great and I really liked the Villeroy & Boch bath. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go to Flo but we did have drinks in Pippa's bar before dinner. This was very cosy probably the quietest part of the hotel. The hotel is in a good location - right next to Rembrandtplein and is easy to get to via tram numbers 4 & 9 from Centraal Station. There are plenty of bars & restaurants in the vicinity so there is no need to go far.

The hotel is just off the Rembrandtplein which has plenty of bars, restaurants and souvenir shops and good transport links via the 4 and 9 trams to Centraal Station. The lobby and reception area are clean and tidy and the check in was fast and easy with the friendly staff. We were allocated room 172 which was on the first floor facing the street where the tram passes by. My first thoughts were that we would be kept up by the passing traffic and rowdy revellers but it was only a minor irritation as we were too tired from partying each night to care. The room itself was on the small side but well decorated and had the all the things you would expect in a modern hotel room: mini bar, flat screen tv, safety deposit box and an exceptionally soft double bed. All the things you would expect apart from a door on the bathroom. We couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t figure out if this was because of the style or it was actually missing for a reason but either way it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t nice for the person not in the bathroom when nature called. If you get stage fright when using the loo you will definitely miss your cue in this room. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure not all rooms are like this as I had a look through some of the pictures on trip advisor and thought that all rooms had sliding frosted glass doors. The room was quite cold at times as it was freezing outside and there was no radiator in our room. We managed to warm the room by turning the air con to its maximum temperature of 28 degrees and that was fine. Would have brought slippers if I\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcd known. The maid service was good and we were given towels when we needed them and the bed sheets were changed when we requested. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat at the Flo restaurant situated near the lobby or go to the bar so can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on them. Overall this hotel is fine if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect anything over and above a standard hotel. Nothing luxurious and nothing unpleasant apart from the awol toilet door. Quiet enough and comfortable enough for a peaceful retreat from the sometimes hectic Amsterdam streets. Would I return?

It is offset one block from Rembrandt Square which helps shield it from noise. The rooms are extremely clean and very new in appearance. There are no cracks, stains, and miscellaneous damages often indicative of older properties. The stone gray paint and bathroom tiles coupled with modern furniture and light fixtures made for a visually appealing experience. The twin beds are comfy, but maybe too comfy.

It's extremely well located in the heart of Amsterdam just off the bustling Rembrandt's Square. The place has a modern, minimalist style - with understated entrance lobby and nicely furnished rooms in the current trends of white walls, walnut furniture, slate tiles, and suede-effect soft furnishings. Our room was amply equiped - complete with small but functional flat-screen TV, fridge, internet access (assuming you've brought your own device). Also included were tea/coffee making facilities, something not that common on Amsterdam hotels. Our first call was to housekeeping to get some extra crockery - given that we only had one of everything! Okay, it's a small point - but it's a double room for goodness sake. Eventually a single small coffee cup arrived but it was late so we made do! Our 2nd and 3rd calls to housekeeping the next day - followed by a trip to reception after an hour's waiting - were because we'd been left no extra coffee and creamer supplies. Finally we got a couple of satchets of each handed in - perhaps there's some sort of tax on this in Amsterdam? The fridges in the rooms have electronic controls on EVERYTHING - which means it's totally impossible to even move them around a little to accomodate anything of your own that you want to cool. Never mind, we thought, there's an ice machine on every floor - but unfortunately no ice bucket in the room! Like so many hotels - even in the 21st centuary - the people who design the bathrooms obviously never have to use them. Is it really so much to ask for that the shower spray be contained in the bath or tray rather than flooding the floor? Or that you can sit on the loo without having to lean to one side to avoid the loo-roll dispenser? Or for sufficient ventilation and extraction that you don't feel like your shaving in the humidity of a a tropical rain forrest! However, the Eden Rembrandt manages one further design feature that I've never seen before - with its glass bathroom doors. Despite the partial frosting, anyone else in the room is not only treated to some interesting views when walking past the bathroom, but to every sound eminating too! We discovered and even better feature on night time visits to the loo - when the shadows on the wall opposite the bathroom cast a cinematic view on the opposite wall - leaving nothing to the imagination. We both liked the Eden, but it would be so much better for just a little extra thought and effort. Would I stay here again? Perhaps - but without these various niggles it would be a definite.", "Date": "June 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cTwas quite nice\u201d", "Author": "LittleEmmo", "ReviewID": "UR16637056", "Content": "I stayed here with my boyfriend for 2 nights.

There was also zero wardrobe space, but the beds were great. The staff in the bar were really nice but again we had problems with the receptionist (not sure if it was the same one we dealt with when checking in) when I called for more towels. The housekeeping staff had cleaned the room and taken away the towels without replacing them - I phoned reception politely asking for towels and was told (gruffly) that towels would be sent. A half hour later 2 little hand towels were delivered. I explained that we had no towels in the room whatsoever and could we have the full set (bath towels, bath mat, hand towel etc) and the receptionist sighed and said 'you have towels', I explained again, she sighed again and said 'fine'. 1 hour later we were still waiting, my friend phoned and was talking to a different person and we got exactly what we wanted in 5 minutes.

The room was very well furnished with comfy beds and free internet, if a little small and with not much of a view, but there was no shower curtain (so the bathroom was almost permanently flooded with water) and our tea/coffee facilities were rarely replenished - maybe they were trying to get us to pay the SIXTEEN EUROS for breakfast? Hotel's location is pretty central, and most of the city centre is within a 15-20 minute walk, but if you are staying here then be sure to print off a map, as it's not easy to find if you just get off the tram at Rembrandtplein.

I stayed in the city 4 or 5 years ago and the Tulip Inn Dam Sq was a nice and friendly hotel - right in the thick of things, if not quite as sophisticated (but at least you don't feel like a naughty child every time you dare to approach the reception desk or the concierge).

When I showed the woman at the reception my reservation, she replied that \"Well, you made the reservation through hotels.nl, not through us, so you really need to contact *them* to get this straight\". That was, of course, entirely absurd. It is the hotel's responsibility to make sure that whoever makes reservations ON THEIR BEHALF does so accurately and properly - not the paying customer's responsibility. I was promised a double bed and coughed up my credit card number to guarantee it. I was not given a double bed when I arrived. Ergo, I was not given what I paid for. The least they could do was (1) accommodate me immediately by switching me to a room with a double bed and apologizing, and (2) contact hotels.nl to make sure this is not repeated in the future. That is what would have happened in any professionally run establishment, certainly anywhere in the US. Instead, what I got was attitude, as if the situation was my fault. The reception staff were completely unhelpful, arrogant, aloof, and at times downright rude. I ended up getting an \"upgrade\" after talking to the manager, but even that took about 15 minutes of arguing, and the \"upgrade\" was really no upgrade - it was no more than what I had originally reserved.

Rooms were nice, but small & I found them to be lacking in character. They've tried to make them modern but really it feels very much like a standard business hotel. The first morning we tried to have a shower & found that the water was freezing cold. We rang down to reception & apparently it was a problem with the whole hotel. We accepted that, problems happen. However, the next evening I tried to run a bath & found the same problem again. I reported this to housekeeping but they didn't seem overly concerned. I said we would expect a discount & they agreed. Anyway, when we checked out the reception hadn't been told about this so we basically had to raise it all again. The Assistant Manager gave us a 5% discount & said we should contact the Manager by email for a further discount. I sent 3 emails & finally a week later got a reply with a further 5%. Overall, its a pretty nice hotel, but even with the discount I found it to be overpriced. Okay, the bed was very comfy, but the lack of hot water was a really big problem. Also, the teabags were not replaced on a daily basis & the shampoo & shower gel in the bathroom were not replenished.

It was difficult to find any available rooms at this busy time, but found a double room at the Eden Rembrandt Square Hotel. Much more than we would normally spend on a hotel, but rooms at a premium due to Easter. Walked from central station in about 15 mins, quite easy to find, very close to Rembrandt Square where bars, cafes, clubs, restaurants etc. An ideal distance away from the Red Light District and surrounding areas so can walk at night whilst staying in a nicer, more relaxed area. Room modern and nice, which would be expected from a new hotel. Can't comment too much on hotel facilities or food as only used room and didn't eat any food, staff friendly enough though. Room with comfortable bed, flat screen TV, mini bar (automatically charged!), nice bathroom with features such as warm mirror, frosted glass door, central bath taps. Lots of storage space. My main complaint was the noisy room as room faced main road. Traffic not a problem and didn't hear any construction noises as in previous reviews but quite a lot of noise from people leaving bars and clubs on square. I would stay again and would give a higher rating except for the very high charge due to easter. Next time I am more likely to stay on a hotel on a nearby canal as more romantic and less noisy.

Everything that you need to see is within walking distance. If you feel like being more leisurely, as we did, you are close to canal boat stops. The square has lots of cafes and restaurants of varied styles and prices. Check out De Kroon - fantastic views of the square, Cafe L'Opera for it's great conservatory and Cafe Schiller for its art deco. There's also Cafe Smokey - the name says it all. As for the hotel itself. Well, we couldn't fault it, despite being there during renovations. The room was a good size for a short stay. The bed was large and extremely comfortable. The decor was modern and there was an lcd tv with English channels. The bathroom was fantastic with heated flooring, a brilliant shower and very well presented. The cleanliness was imaculate.Our room was on the 5th floor at the front of the hotel. The one downside of the location of our room was the noise from drunken revellers in the square. However, this was only a problem on Saturday night, and we did realise in the morning that our window wasn't quite shut properly which may have made things worse.

It's just off Rembrandt Square which has some bars, restaurants, a nightclub and a nice selection of less commercialised coffee shops near by. There is a tram stop about 200m away but if the thought of trams seems a bit scary as it did to us, the hotel is about a 15-20 minute walk from Central Station. Our room was at the front of the hotel with the trams going past between 6am -12am. The noise isn't much of a problem until they ring the bell to warn people to get out the way. Unfortunately no amount of double glazing will keep that noise out so I suggest asking for a room away from the front of the hotel. We were then woken at 8am (admittidly it was a Monday) by workman on the building site directly opposite which we had failed to notice upon our arrival on a quite Sunday afternoon. The quality of the room was very good value with modern fittings and clean although we did not spend much time there. Flat screen tv with a few english channels amongst others and v. comfy beds. The mini-bar is automatic so charges you even if you move something then put it back. Desk with chair and nice arm chair with foot stool but you should know that the bathroom door is mainly frosted but doesn't give much privacy so I wouldn't recommend for people who aren't that close to the person sharing the room! Lovely powerful shower and reasonable hair dryer. My main bug bear with this hotel is the housekeeping. On our first morning, we left the Do Not Disturb sign on the door until about 11am when we left for the day and turned it round to say Please clean our room. We returned from a day of sightseeing at around 7pm to find our beds have not been made (2 singles as I don't think they have doubles). I kept my cool and politely explained to the receptionist (who was a little abrupt unlike many of the natives) that despite being out for 8 hours during the day, our room had still not been serviced. She apologised and said she'll get someone straight on to it. Thinking our problem was being resolved, we went out and enjoyed the evening only to return at midnight to find the room was still untouched. I was too tired to make a fuss at that time of the night so we made them ourselves and went to sleep. Normally, I would have really kicked off about that because when you pay to stay in a hotel, you don't expect to have to make your own bed. However on this occasion, I just wanted to get out and enjoy the sunshine without getting myself in a bad mood and we were leaving later that day so there was nothing really to be done about it. (I'd already paid in full via Expedia so no use trying to get money off the bill!) Having said all of the above, we were only in Amsterdam for 2 nights and although incredibly irritating, it did not in any way ruin our trip. If you are just going for a few days, I would recommend this hotel to my friends and would stay there again myself due to the location and high spec rooms but just remember to get a room away from the front of the building and probably not a good idea if you're staying for any length of time.", "Date": "March 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Port Macquarie, Australia", "Title": "\u201cspot on!\u201d", "Author": "geordieinfrance", "ReviewID": "UR7225620", "Content": "what can i say...booked at last min a day before we went...hotel was lovely...clean, nice staff...even got an upgrade to a junior suite (rm 585)...all in all very happy!", "Date": "March 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cWhat a complete Joke!! do yourself a favour and don't stay.\u201d", "Author": "bigwal", "ReviewID": "UR7199558", "Content": "This place masquerades as a decent hotel, however don't be fooled!! As someone who is unfortunate enough to spend 75% of my life in hotels (some people even call me Alan Partridge) I certainly know what I am talking about on this subject.

The first room I had was excellent, very good decor and a really nice bathroom with a bath and separate shower. This week was fine, however since then things have got progressively worse. The noise from the Trams and the drunks at night trundling past your window at 3am is a little irritating. Most of the other rooms I had although well decorated are all very small. The standard breakfast that costs an arm and a leg is exactly the same EVERY morning, a baguette, croissant, one slice of cheese and once slice ham served with of ONE glass of orange and one coffee or tea. You do have the option of some nicer stuff but all of that costs extra on top of the already very expensive basic price......even a top up of orange costs extra!!! You are probably bored by now, however the worst is yet to come. After working very late and arriving at 2am in the hotel I was very ready for bed. I managed to drop off at about 2:30am only to be awoken at 4am by drilling and hammering!!! In their infinite wisdom they decide to refurbish the restaurant directly beneath my and a number of other rooms and at 4am!. I called to complain twice but was fobbed off being told they could do nothing. After only getting 2 and a half hours sleep I eventually gave in and got up at 8am. I complained in the morning to the Manager and was treated with contempt, eventually she agreed to change my room..........to a much smaller room although at least it was now non smoking like I had originally asked for!! As I was already late for a customer meeting the hotel staff agreed to move my suitcase and clothes in the wardrobe for me, when I returned in the evening, you guessed it my clothes where gone. The hotel has now lost ALL of my clothes, I am left with one pair of jeans and one shirt!!!

To be honest it all added to the excitement and the lobby was pristine by evening. The rooms were compact and functional, plenty of cupboard/drawer space. The bed was HUGE and super-soft. Wall mounted LCD TV and cool decor made the room feel very hip and boutique-y. Only major draw back to the room was the fact that the bathroom walls were glass, yes, glass. And only partially etched so actually not very private at all. Scarier than that was the fact that the bathroom door was salon-style so no noises were contained! We got used to it quite quickly, but we did feel quite uncomfortable at first as we really hadn't been together that long. Our room had particularly noisy air-con which I found really irritating, and on complaining I found the reception staff to be quite flippant and unwilling to help. Porters and cleaners on the otherhand were very courteous and responsive. There was an empty space where the mini bar and safe should have been, but I must stress that we were amoung the very first guests and that didn't detract from the experience.

If you come out of the hotel and turn right its the second turning on your right, we can't rememder the exact name but bit begings with an s and is in green writing. Also on the main road heading towards Dam Square on the left is a restaurant is called Le monde de march which was absolutly gorgeous, they do such lovely and healthy food with a massive choice for lunch. We also did madam tusaude, amsterdam dungens, anne frank house, cannal cruise and the heineken experience which were all really good. We would recommend before you do any trips to go to an excursion ticket shop. There is one next to Madam Tusaude and the man in there was so helpful. The tickets you buy from him not only save you money but you get a fast pass ticket allowing you to avoide the queues.

The write-up on Expedia encouraged us to look more closely, and the price/package was good, though we were only there one night on a flying visit. Check in was at three (we arrived at 1200 midday) but the concierge stored our bags while we stepped out. The Hotel is one minute from Rembrandtplein and the same to the stop for Trams 4 and 9 for the Central Station via the Dam. Reception was efficient and professional, in keeping with the Hotel's modern ambience. Our room was surprisingly large, lots of room to move/spread out, a nice armchair and flat-screen TV with excellent menu of TV channels, films etc. Minibar with \"intelligent\" (rather scary) fridge that automatically \"knows\" what you've removed. Kettle, drinks, glasses (sparkling clean). The room was immaculate, though there was a vague tobacco smell (we asked for non-smoking). Bathroom super, gleaming, shower cap, ample space to lay out make-up stuff (my wife says all women appreciate a bathroom with shelves, good lighting etc). Check-out is an indulgent 1200 midday - what a boon. Beds super-soft, delicious. Room quiet, warm, sanctuary. This hotel deserves to be a well-kept secret, and we would like to return. Summit hotels (the chain) have hotels world-wide. Hope they are all as good. Native English-speakers should IMO never take for granted the skill and application of Dutch staff in meeting their needs so effortlessly. Congratulations to everyone concerned.

I was always staying at Swissotel Amsterdam due to our company aggreement. However due to lack of space, I had to find an alternative for my first four days of my 10 days visit in November 2006. I have checked the reviews on tripadvisor and made a reservation to the hotel from the hotels website. The reviews on TA were describing something like a hotel in heaven. In this respect I was a bit disappointed, not because of hotel or the facilities it has, but just the tooo gooood comments increase my expectations. First thing I would like to tell, this is a real good hotel. As I have been to Amsterdam several times, I can easily name it, as a best buy you can get in Amsterdam. But dont expect the hotel of your dreams, just a nice, reasonable, modern and comfortable one The hotel is located at Rembrandt square, a very nice and convenient place. It costs around 10\u00e2\u201a\u00ac from the central station by taxi or you can take the tram 4, 16 or 25 from the CS to Rembrandt Square and walk 30 meters to the Hotel. The rooms are so comfortable. The bathroom is very nice and good quality soaps, shower gels are making a long bath very enjoyable. The beds, are marvellous. I can tell that I had one of the nicest beds after so many years. The only bad part is you wont even want to wake up. All rooms are equipped with an LCD tv with nearly 20 international channels and also pay tv channels. One very good thing of the hotel is that they offer a free internet connection. There are two desktops in the lobby and wireless network. If you carry your laptop, you can easily connect and also there is an LAN connection in the room free of charge. It is not easy to find free internet connection in Amsterdam in many places.

The reception and concierge were very nice. we could leave our luggage in the hotel after check out. there is free internet with 2 computers in the lobby for the guests (were never busy) and even a printer. the internet for your laptop is not wireless (only in the lobby) but it's free, which was great in order to stay in touch with the family back home. 5. The breakfast was included so it was nice (we payed for extras like omletes which are not included). if i hadn't gotten it in the room price, I probably would have eaten out. but with the extras it was tasty and sufficient. 6. at the hotel you get quite a good map of amsterdam, so don't buy one if you don't have to. 7. There is a great bath!!! 8. As advised here I asked and got a room on the 5th floor. The room was very big (double bed, desk, chair, room for 2 huge suitcases).

We arrived to discover that we had been upgraded to a junior suite, as we were celebrating a 50th birthday - the receptionist even wished my husband 'Happy Birthday' when we checked in! I was so pleased with the room, as others have stated, the beds were amazingly comfortable with great big soft pillows, and our room was sooooo quiet. The decor was very modern (in fact it was very grey!!!)) and we just had so much space. The bathroom was simply amazing.(I really like getting a nice bathroom when on holiday and I wasn't disappointed!!) We had a huge bath with and adjustable shower head, plus a wet room part with a huge rain shower and another adjustable shower head - incredible!!!! (there was even a bottle opener screwed to the wall of the wet room - a nice touch if you want a beer with your bath!!) Lovely toiletries, big fluffy towels, such luxury!!! Enough about the bathroom - the other facilities in the room included plasma screen TV, showing BBC1 and CBBies as well as a few other channels. Plenty of lights, plug points, hairdryer, very well stocked mini bar, desk, tea and coffee making facilities, .... the list goes on!! We had such a comfortable stay here. After walking around all day it was lovely to chill out in such luxury and such warmth,as the weather was cold outside. The location is also excellent - don't expect to be canalside, or to have a lovely view, or for the hotel to look pretty, but do expect to be within walking distance of most things that you will want to see. Trams run from Rembrandt Square to Central station ( 9 and 25 I think, from memory) and are so cheap. The Flower Market (which I adored) is less than ten mnutes away, and other attarctions such as Museum Square and the Anne Frank House aren't more than about 15 0r 20 minutes once you get your bearings. There are numerous lovely restaurants nearby for evening meals, and the concierge was most helpful with bookings, recommendations, directions etc. The only downside to all of this was the breakfasts. On arrival we were told that our breakfast was included, so we took it, in the restaurant (flo's) that adjoins the hotel. It was more like 'bread and breakfast' than bed and breakfast. We were presented, with, well, a huge plate of ...bread, basically. Croissants, Danish pastries and freshly baked baguettes. (the take 'n' bake kind)Also you got orange juice and tea or coffee, butter and jams. Eggs, fruit, cereal etc were extra. Some people would like this kind of food, I know - so, if you do, take no notice of me!! As I say, because I thought it was included, we stuck it out. Although by the thrid day I couldn't really face another danish pastry. However, on checkout we were charged for it, and no amount of negotiation could persuade the receptionist that we had been told it was included. If I had known we would be paying, I would have gone elsewhere for breakfast - tried out some local cafes, etc. It cost 19 euros for two people, which was quite dear for what it was.

Expected deafening levels of revelry and debauchery after the victory; if they occurred, we did not hear a thing in our room. Avoid the restaurant adjacent to hotel for breakfast; they got everything wrong on our final day there. The cafes on the square much more charming with better food.", "Date": "October 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cThe best beds\u201d", "Author": "Sue29", "ReviewID": "UR5982640", "Content": "This hotel has a three star rating but it is far better than any three star we stayed in.

Location is just off Rembrandt Sqaure which is about 15 mins walk from Cental Station. Everything is within walking distance, Dam Square, Red Light District, museums, bars, clubs and restaurants. Its a nice clean location. The hotel seems pretty new and is very modern in design. We arrived around 2pm and although check-in was specified as after 3pm we were shown to our room. Polite reception staff and concierge. Room was very modern design, nice shower/bathroom. The beds were VERY comfortable - the most comfortable I've slept in. Nice plasma TV on the wall with some UK channels as well, mini-bar (expensive) although the view was of the back of hotel its not something I'm that bothered about. Basically, the hotel photos and traveller photos are exactly how we found the hotel - the rooms, shower/bathroom and even the picture of the breakfast. Breakfast was a bit of a let down. The staff were pretty poor. They were uninformed and service was slow and you often had to ask for service. This is a complete contrast to the rest of the hotel staff. Strange. The actual breakfast was included in the price but all you get is OJ, Tea/Coffee, Pan au chocolat, pan au raisin and a plain baguette. This is quite filling although all hot food was extra. Scramble eggs with smoked salmon is lovely! Not over priced at 4 euros but it would have been nice to have hot breakfast included in the price. There is free internet access in the hotel reception (nice touch) and the concierge was helpful and knowledgable about the area. He does go missing quite a bit though. There was a luggage storage room if you needed to store luggage after checking out and before leaving the hotel. Overall I would definitley recommend this hotel. If you have a look on the web you can get very cheap deals. 2 people for 2 nights cost us 193 Euros (including 4 hot breakfasts). <50 Euros pppn for a 4* hotel in the heart of Amsterdam is great value!!! Though I fear this may go up as the hotel becomes more well known. I think the cheap prices are because it is new and needs customers.

It turned out that I'd made an excellent choice. For four nights over the Bank Holiday Weekend the Eden Rembrandt cost approx \u00c2\u00a385 per room per night which, although not inexpensive, made for an excellent deal compared to other hotels of a lesser standard in Central Amsterdam. The location is excellent. Not quite perfect but not far off. It's a simple 10/15 Euro Taxi ride from the Central Station, 50 paces from the lively Rembrandt Square & 10/15 minutes walk from Daam Square. Even though Rembrandt Square may not be to everyone's tastes myself & my girlfriend thought it was great to be able to finish a meal and sit & enjoy a drink or two in one of a number of cafe's with huge streetside seating area's watching the hustle & bustle of this superbly vibrant city pass by then retire to the hotel only a minute or two away. The street that the hotel entrance faces onto is anything but glamourous but a large part of Amsterdam is similar to this and whilst there was a lot of people around both entering & leaving Rembrandt Square's night-clubs, there was never any feeling of unease that you can sometimes feel in other parts of the city. The hotel lobby is pretty basic & amenities are few although this is again similar to much of the city's hotels. It's the rooms that make this hotel stand apart from the others. Our room was quite simpy massive for a city centre hotel with a very large main bedroom area with a decent size area off to a right angle with writing desk, minibar, wardrobe & very nice touch of free electronic safe. Brand new flat screen wall mounted LCD Tv on wall (although the cables were dropping and exposed). The bathroom sat behind very classy frosted glass doors and was decked out in stylish granite tiles with very good quality fixtures & fittings. They taps & shower fittings were highly poilished every day by House Keeping which added to the quality of stay. The bed itself was luxurious with supersoft bedding and a very cool touch were the flexible reading lights - very futuristic. The only negative aspect of the room was no view but this wasn't an issue as, quite often with hotels in the city centre it's better to be facing the central core than the street with noise possibly being an issue. Amsterdam itself provided us with a perfect 4 day break - from shopping to food to culture and all things in between. Anne Frank's house was exteremly emotional and shouldn't be missed. The boat trip was enjoyable if not a little repetitive as most of the larger canal's in the centre all look the same. We took a train ride to Holland's Major Theme Park \"Efteling\" which was a great day out & even Madame Tussaud's was enjoyable when it rained non-stop and was certainly a lot cheaper than London !!! All in all Amsterdam provided us with exactly what we were looking for in a short break and the Eden Rembrandt was the perfect base to explore from and retire to after a long day and night. NB - be careful not to mix this hotel up with it's sister hotel, the \"origninal\" Eden which directly backs onto this hotel although is apparently nowhere near as nice. Make sure you also clarify with your taxi driver that it's the Rembrandt Eden and get him to confirm that he understands. Even though it's best to get a train from the airport and then a taxi to the hotel we managed to get a taxi direct from the hotel to the airport for 32 Euro's which is worth it.", "Date": "September 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cStaff needs training\u201d", "Author": "kiboko", "ReviewID": "UR5727886", "Content": "I stayed in August in the Eden Rembrandt Square.

The hotel entrance is very close to Rembrandt square and from there you can walk to all the monuments and tourist attractions in Amsterdam. It is also very close to bars, restaurants and clubs.

It was also very clean, with comfortable beds and a wonderful bathroom. In the room there are also a minibar and a safe. The only negative elements I could find about this hotel were: 1) Breakfast is nothing special. If you want eggs and cheese you have to pay. You get coffee/tea orange juice, bread and a croissant with jam. The rest needs to be paid. 2) The day I checked out I've heard a couple telling to the front desk that someone had entered into their room the previous night and stole some of their belongings. I don't know what exactly happened but I saw the person at the front desk directing these two people to the duty manager office. So the hotel was taking care of what happened. 3) The windows are not 100% soundproof. There were people celebrating in Rembrandt Square during my stay and the music was loud. I could hear the music from my room. But when I arrived the hotel informed me with a letter that it was gay pride week end and I had to expect some noises.
