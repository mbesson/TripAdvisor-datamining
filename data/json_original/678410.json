I was upgrade by a very polite receptionist. Al tough the TV remote & iron very not functioning they were replaced instantly. Good location, just 5 minutes from Spinney's and also Burjuman Mall & Karama were nearby. Only fault I could find was there was no phone next to the bed. Also, Wi-fi was complimentary.

The location is not too bad; the metro is about 10 minute walk. But, there's nothing exciting around. The room is spacious with separate laundry room, kitchen, living room and bed room. It's good value for sure. There were some families staying on the same floor, and the kids and people were making loud noises, which the hotel didn't do anything about it. Plus, the floor was always smelly from cooking from other rooms. Also, I could hear street noise from the street pretty noticeably. I also didn't get my wake up call on time and could have missed my flight. Breakfast was nothing to write about. Swimming pool wasn't heated and couldn't be used. But, the staff were kind. Again, it's a decent value for the money.", "Date": "February 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "rosiewillow", "ReviewID": "UR120238772", "Content": "We arrived at the hotel at 12noon and were able to check in straight away. The staff we met were all pleasant and helpful. Suite 1401 was large, clean and comfortable. It consisted of a living room with sofas, TV and dining table, a large fitted kitchen, a large bedroom with en-suite bathroom, a cloakroom and utility room. Ideal for an extended stay. The kitchen included all utensils, a new fridge/freezer, microwave and 2 ring hob. The location s great as it is about 400metres from Al Karama metro station, has a bus stop right outside and a large supermarket within a 10 minute walk. It is a 10 minute car ride from Dubai airport. The only negative is that breakfast is only served from 8am.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, good location, great staff!\u201d", "Author": "jcerovac", "ReviewID": "UR115946155", "Content": "The hotel is not the posh 5+ (er, um, \"7 star\") one might find elsewhere in Dubai; but then, it is also reasonably priced, clean, and a good value for the Dirham. It is in a good location, on Kuwait Street, which gives easy access to taxis, buses, and a short walk to the Dubai Metro. The pool is comfortable if not a little small, and the gym is little more than a walk-in closet with a bench, treadmill, and bike; but it is still quite functional. The sauna is comfortable and all of the facilities are kept clean by the friendly and helpful staff.

Staff are friendly and very helpful, although I had to wait on arrival but I suppose it was due to me being early.
