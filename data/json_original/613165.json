{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good for staying a night before your flight. The hotel is modern and clean located just a few miles from the airport. A typical European continental breakfast is an additional $6.90 euros. Internet service is available and free, and there is a terminal in the lobby you can use for a small fee. Parking is ample. However, there is no restaurant or bar service. You can walk across the street to Motel One for bar service or use the vending machines in the hotel for soda, beer, juice or coffee along with chips, cookies, and candy.The hotel can be seen from the autobahn but can be quite tricky to get to. Staff is pleasant enough. We had a family room with two single beds and a set of bunk beds. The shower is tricky, and we flooded the floor accidentally before we left. Pillows are roll style and a bit small, but beds are comfy enough and blankets are warm.The hotel is in the middle of nowhere, so I would not suggest it as a place to stay if you plan on sightseeing in Frankfurt. It is good for staying prior to a flight. Close to the autobahn and a good value.", "Date": "Dec 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR761265616", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "tired_mom63"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d613165-r22386712-B_B_Hotel_Frankfurt_Niederrad-Frankfurt_Hesse.html", "HotelID": "613165", "Price": "$66"}}
