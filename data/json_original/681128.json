Bathroom was small and a bit aged but everything worked. The reception is in a cafe / bar (GLBT friendly), which is open until late night. The rooms are in the adjacent building. Breakfast is served in the cafe. The Hotel is situated in a lively part of former East-Berlin (Sch\u00f6nhausen), close to underground and regional train station. Rooms are quiet at night because the windows are mainly to the backside (courts). Would recommed to singles and younger couples.", "Date": "April 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Avondale, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cBerlin Get away\u201d", "Author": "colivier", "ReviewID": "UR10082373", "Content": "This hotel is close to the subway, easy to get to. The rooms is a little on the small side. If you have a lot of luggage then it might be a problem. The restaurant next door is very convenient but there is also other places to eat on the street.
