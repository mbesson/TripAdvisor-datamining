GOOD: The location is really convenient for walking to Kodak Theatre and the craziness of the Hollywood Blvd as well as a very short driving distance to Universal Studios. We had a rental car and we definitely made use of it in order to see Santa Monica, Malibu, Beverly Hills and Bel Air. The bed was pretty comfortable and the rooms are kept impeccable by some very hard working Spanish ladies. Free Wi-Fi was a bonus. BAD: The continental breakfast is really only donuts and coffee, but I guess it was better than nothing. The street outside can be loud at times especially on the weekend, but it all depends where your room is going to be. We actually had to change our first night room due to the outside noise and we got the room right on top of the alley which was great since it was facing the court and you had no one staying under you. I\u2019d highly recommend this room if you can get it. Also, Expedia did not charge for this hotel upfront so we had to pay for it on the spot. One thing to really watch out for is that if you pay for the rooms, there is no reimbursement if you decide to go somewhere else. The parking lot is usually not sufficient for the number of cars, so be prepared to park blocking other cars and leave your car keys at the front desk so they can move it when needed. Overall, we didn\u2019t spend too much time in the room as we were sightseeing nonstop, but we really liked the convenience of the location, the comfortable room and the great value per night.", "Date": "October 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood location, nice sized rooms.\u201d", "Author": "truckstopblues", "ReviewID": "UR117478395", "Content": "We stayed here for 3 nights, the location is convienient for accessing the rest of Hollywood and LA by foot or public transport however as with most of LA it is very loud and I personally felt unsafe at night.

I found this hotel with the help of Tripadvisor, and its reviewers, and found the vast majority of the reviews to be accurate. Overall this is an average hotel in a perfect location for one to check out Hollywood. The stroll from the hotel down to the Walk of Fame and Grauman's Theater takes only minutes; Sunset Blvd, just a little longer. All of the gripes that I had about the room were not the fault of the hotel or its staff. We checked into a non-smoking room only to find that its previous tenants had not only enjoyed several packs of cigarettes, but also some herbal delights. Try as she might, the cleaning lady had a tough time getting rid of the smell and had to resort to approximately 10 gallons of Pinesol, which quickly wore off, believe it or not. Since the hotel was completely booked for a busy film festival, we could not get a different room. My wife is not one to tolerate the smell of cigarettes, so we asked if they would refund our second night and after talking to the manager, she agreed, in part I am sure, since the rate we secured ($75) was well below what they could get from a last minute traveler. While this is certainly no romantic getaway, it's a great value and doesn't pretend to be anything it's not.

The staff have always been exceedingly friendly, professional & helpful. In addition the rates are exceedingly good, the rooms are clean & well equipped including fridge, microwave & very efficient air conditioning. I have stayed in a total of about 8 different rooms all of which I have found to be very secure & soundproof. It is centrally located in easy reach of all freeways & is in the shadows of the Hollywood sign. If you are concerned about the area don't be I've always found it to be safe and there is an enclosed parking lot where each car passes the office. As a frequent traveller to LA over the past 13 years I can confidently say that this place competes very favorably with others that are at least twice the price. My advise is stay at least one night & see for yourself .....& enjoy spending the money you've saved on one of the many things LA has to offer.", "Date": "August 31, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Ramon", "Title": "\u201cWorse hotel ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Got there Friday at 12:00 and was told to wait 30 minutes for the room to be done. Was overcharged $30 for the room (later refunded). Got into the room and after a logn drive wanted to take a shower. Found that the water was going to be off until 6pm. There was a lot of constructiong going on at the hotel at the time. We woke up Saturday morning at 8:00 to the noise of the roof being re done (were not told) about 10 minutes later we get a call saying the water was going to be turned off again and to get up now and shower. Actually we never got the call our friends did and the owner told them to tell us for him. So apart from being woke up we laid in bed for a while trying to relax when the f**kning light falls on our bed. We had to leave the hotel for the entite day to get away from the noise and the fact that we couldn't use the toilet. When asked to refuns money they pretty much said too bad!

Being on a time schedule, I did what I could to clean up and get dressed. Upon checking out, I made sure to tell the front desk about the shower so it could be fixed before the next person staying checked in. Instead of being thankful, the Indian girl I spoke to was extremely rude and started yelling at me. Taken by suprise, I tried to understand why she was behaving this way. She started screaming at me, calling me names and saying that I was trying to trick her (with what?). To be honest, I was frightened by her so I got in my car to leave. She followed me to my car screaming obscenities and threatening me to get off her property. I couldn't believe that her parents, who also run the hotel, were standing there as well and did nothing to stop her. Anyone thinking of staying here should not. There are plenty of other hotels in the area for the same price that are much nicer looking and closer to the tourist attractions.

I wanted something near $100, and hadn't even considered the Best Inn until I found it on Trip Advisor and read the preceeding reviews. It had the best reviews by far for budget hotels in the area, and I am soooo glad I chose it. It is a clean little motel with friendly service. The furniture and bedding was nicer than I had expected for a motel in this price range, and the 7 Eleven five steps away is very convenient for anything you need. A cab ride to the Sunset strip is about $15. The Hollywood and Highland complex is even closer. There is no closet, but there is a towel shelf with hangers attached. No bathtub, but a decent shower. They provide plastic tables and chairs (lawn furniture) for you to hang out on and get out of your room w/o leaving the hotel if you don't want to go anywhere, but don't want to be stuck in the room. One group was taking advantage of this with bottles of wine and beers, even. Don't be put off by the somewhat shabby, non-air conditioned check-in \"lobby.\" It is the eyesore of the property and it's not even that bad for the few minutes you're in there. As expected, there was no pool, and soda and ice vending machines only. Free \"breakfast\" is coffee and donuts from 8-9:30 am. Yes, it is true that the parking lot is small and that it is a good idea to back into your parking space to avoid having to back out onto a busy street (N. Caughenga Blvd). And they only allow one car per hotel room since the lot is small, even though we had a double room with 3 occupants and 2 cars (however, he did let us park the second car in the lot later at night when it was apparent we wouldn't be taking a spot away from another room's car). My only real grievance is that they charged the credit card I had used to hold the room with before we had gotten there, even though that was not the card we were intending to pay with upon checkout. They did not offer to reverse it and take another form of payment instead, but fortuantely for us it did not be that big of a deal, although I'm sure it would have been for somone that used a debit card. My final total for a double with 3 people on a Saturday night, including taxes, was $96.60.
