I have stayed here once or twice per year for the last 5 years. The staff are charming, the breakfast is good, the location is perfect. If you take the 197 bus from Schiphol Airport, it will drop you about 4 blocks from the hotel. This will set you back 4 euro rather than the 35 or so for a taxi. I almost never take trams in town as I can walk to almost everything I want to visit. This trip I stayed in one of the large doubles which was very roomy. I often stay in one of the singles which are fairly small, but well laid out. If you push your bag under the desk you aren't tripping over it and it is fine for one person. The rooms are very clean with lots of hot water and at a very reasonable price. There is a lovely back yard off of the breakfast room where you can watch the parrots - not native to Amsterdam, but these escapees have certainly thrived.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value for a 4 Person Room\u201d", "Author": "Kevin T", "ReviewID": "UR126411892", "Content": "We were here on a last second trip to Amsterdam.

Ruth (I think was her name) was so helpful and friendly. She answered all our stupid questions with a smile. Second, the location is good. It is steps from Leidseplein while still quiet enough. We, of course, walked everywhere, but it is convenient to have so many places to eat or grab a drink nearby. Lastly, the breakfast and breakfast area were nice. We ate outside in the garden area the first day. There were breads, cereals, meats, cheeses, and other things that kept us full until lunch. Okay, now for the not-so-good: The room: We stayed in a small double, which was small but not the smallest we stayed in. It just didn't feel clean enough, although I think it could just be the walls and bedding and such. A paint job and some new linens would go a long way. The bathroom: It smelled. In general: We didn't bring our cell phones because it was cheaper for us to buy a calling card to call the U.S. I used the card at the hotel but had to pay per minute just to call out. I don't understand why they would charge you to make a free call. I don't care if every other hotel in Amsterdam does it, too; that doesn't make it right. We stayed on the 4th floor and walked up the incredibly steep spiral stairs every time we needed to get to the room because the lift was VERY slow. The city: Amsterdam was not my favorite city. It is really neat and cute with all the canals and old houses, but it all felt dirty. There were urinals on the street! Also, my husband and I had a few beers at a bar and I had to pay to use the restroom there! I was already paying 5.20 euros per beer and I had to pay .50 euro to use the restroom!

We felt we were much better off where we were and really if you wanted to, you probably could walk to Dam Square within 30-40 mins.
