Again - - gotcha sucka! The hotel is centrally located,actually great location that is close to Front St., downtown shopping, entertainment venues, etc. No complaints on that score. Groupon sold the deal with a $25 hotel credit to upgrade from a Zen suite to a Lotus suite. Sadly, as soon as the word groupon escaped our lips, the hotel was sold out for the night and we could not use the credit to upgrade -- unless we wanted the penthouse suite for $3500 a night. I wish that I had taken photos of our Zen suite, replete with stained Ikea Klippen sofa, because the notion of anything in the Cosmopolitan, short of a used car in their parking garage, being worth $3500 is insanely funny. The \"suite\" was really a dorm room with very dirty, dusty, yucky decor nods to new age/feng shui....two water features with bamboo (and algae!)...a yoga mat that I would not use without a round of penicillin....and empty wine bottles as design. Thoughtfully, the management had loaded the CD player with something that sounded like the music/bird sounds they play when you are getting a massage. Also interesting were the slightly Scientology looking literature/pamphlets on finding your inner healthy child that were left on the tv stand but could be purchased at checkout for $19.95. We looked for Yanni, Ramtha and Linda Evans in the closet but couldn't find them. We faced a rooftop exhaust system so all the yoga and incense in the world would not have made this serene or tranquil.

When we noticed and opened the door, we thought maybe housekeeping was there, but they were not. We then inquired downstairs at the front desk and they said housekeeping had just finished our room recently. They must not have closed the door all the way by accident. That is a pretty big accident. Luckily, we did not have any valuables lying around. Furthermore, we didn't think the room was that well kept either. There was definitely dust balls in the hidden areas and the furniture seemed a bit worn out.

My original criteria for selecting the cosmo was that it was a 4 star with strong reviews and very close to everything. I will describe the aspects of this hotel in such a way that anyone skimming this review can likely jump to what is important. The room: I was in a Zen Suite (their cheapest room). This room was MUCH bigger than i expected. a fully functional kitchenette, living room, decent and clean washroom and a very decently sized bedroom. The bed was excellent. The washer and dryer was a surprise. The living room was nice enough that I entertained friends one evening (and actually cooked up something for them). The bathroom was very bright and clean, but the toilet could have used some maintenance. I did not really have a view on the 11th floor (except into the opposing office building... and they could likely see me very well as well), but this just is not an issue for me. If anyone else needs a view, specifically request a room near the top of the hotel. One thing to note, I would not call this room child friendly. It is definitely geared towards adults (modern, simple, elegant). In addition, the sound proofing was not the best. I expect that if you bring children, it will in fact be you disturbing other clients. This again was not an issue for me but should be considered. Location: If you are planning to walk, it is a great spot. Minutes from most anything in the core downtown. The road was not easy to get to by car because of construction, and I am told this is not uncommon, and parking (should you need it) is not cheap... about $35/night (I flew in). First Impressions: When you first walk in, it is somewhat claustrophobic in the entrance area. VERY small. The hallways too. As a result, I started out with a weak impression of what this stay will be like. I felt much better when I found my room. Staff: Extremely nice and helpful. A newspaper at my door every morning, and everyone seemed to genuinely enjoy working at this hotel. Makes for a nice change. I was a bit thrown off by women coming in the evening with incense or other aroma items, but it is a spa'ish/zen'ish hotel, and it fits with the theme.

So we put the tag on the door and went out for the day, when we got back it seemed our room was half cleaned..bed was made, new towels-but old towels were left, and house coats still pilled in the room. + When we went out on the saturday night suddenly my boyfriends car that was taken by the valet the night before has a completely new noise to it (like a broken coil). Those can happen anytime, but it definitely wasn't making that noise on our hour drive in, so it was just kinda weird. +When we came back to the hotel on saturday night, ( we had decided to come back to eight bar- so he can have a drink) when we walked up to the bar , it was packed and there was a great dance flood happening- Problem was it was a PRIVATE party on the saturday of valentines weekend. That sucked. so we went to our room on floor 9 Room 905 and could hear the music from the dance floor until around 2 am . so we couldn't enjoy the club ,only be annoyed by it. + lastly when checking out I told the man that last time they billed us they messed up and charged us for breakfast (which comes with the CAA package)...he said don't worry its covered- then handed us a bill with $33 parking. I had to point out (like every time I have stayed there) that with the CAA package it says parking is discounted rate of $20. he then said \"oh the promos over, is that still up on the site\" <--- and yeah I think it has been since we first stayed here like 4 years ago. anyway. bad stay.

Very quiet considering the hotel is located downtown, the only noise that could be heard was sirens once and a while and a constant backnoise of air conditionning outside, but it wasn't enough to bother us. The sound can be easily drowned out by music or the noise of the fountain. I love how the room is decorated! The only problem we had was when we got here the parking spots at the front were all taken, so a staff person told us to park on the other side of the street while we checked in and took our stuff to our room, minutes after parking we got a parking ticket, but when we came back down, someone from the reception area had already cleared it up and we will not need to pay since we are from out of town (Quebec), if we do receive papers about this, the hotel will pay for us, which is very nice considering it wasn't really our fault.

When you walk in the hotel, the front desk is compact as is the bar. We were shown a room with a \"balcony\", but it was just a sliding door with about six inches of space. You could definitely not go and even stand on the ledge unless you had a suicide wish. The only thing that we found if good for was ripening up avacados (see photo). We decided not to choose this room, but rather a room on the 27 floor that had a view of the CN tower, with a peek at the water behind. No complaints about this. We chose the style of room that is an \"open concept\". Although it feels very roomy, the curtains allow much light it, so you cannot really sleep in. We did like the lay out of the room and the contemporary feel of it all, however the furniture in the room has seen better days and is worse for wear (see photo). Our biggest issues are the following: extra daily charge for internet, no ice(must ask at front for delivery), CLEANLINESS. Okay, into the the biggest problem, which is the lack of basic cleanliness. Cleanliness problem #1) The sheets on our bed never fit properly and we were staying for six nights, so I requested on the second night that they please change to a seet that fit the bed. The maid said that someone had put the wrong sized sheets on the bed and went to get new sheets. When she stripped the bed, it was noticable that there was NO mattress pad or barrier between the mattress and sheets. When she made the bed, she did not correct this. I had to make a seperate request to get a mattress pad. When it came, it was old and rumpled and the elastics were not even working ot keep it in place. The maid had to make some phone calls to get some sheets that would fit. This took some time and when they arrived, again they were rumpled. But, worse, the top sheet had stains on it and the bottom sheet had holes in it (see photos). The maid could see this as well, but never corrected it. I didn't want to bother her yet again to have to make another phone call and get who knows what linen off of who knows what bed, so I let it ride. A few days later, the same maid asked me if I wanted the sheets changes and I said, \"well, we are here for one more night and there are holes in the sheet.\" She never changed them. Cleanliness problem #2)When we checked in, the back of the purple tub chair had some type of liquid spilled all over it. This was never cleaned off the entire 6 nights that we were there. Cleanliness problem #3) Even though the maid made the appearance of tidying up and mopping, a very poor job was done. When we checked into the hotel, we noticed a pill on the floor in the bathroom. For six nights, that pill remained on the floor (see photo) Cleanliness problem #4) The bathroom tiles in the shower were filthy (see photos).

The room, on the 9th floor, was a deluxe one-bedroom suite. It had room enough for two of us to feel comfortable (about 470 sq. ft). The bedroom, while a bit small, had a small chest of drawers for clothes. All the beds are Queen size and can be a bit confining, but they ARE comfortable. The living room has a small couch, desk and chair, coffee table and two ottomans. TVs in the living room as well as bedroom. In the sleek bathroom, there is a vessel sink on a slate-topped open cabinet---very nice. There is no bathtub, but the shower was good enough for our stay. It has a full kitchen in a modern design with breakfast bar; we brought our breakfast up from the breakfast room (price included with room) and were able to have leisurely mornings. There is a washer/dryer which is a plus for anyone who has been on the road for a long time. The water feature in the living room is a creative, soothing addition. The nightly incense on the breakfast bar and gemstones placed on the bed symbolizing energy, spirituality, etc. were an interesting touch. The suite was immaculate and the housekeeping serivce was excellent. We did have to ask for extra towels, but that request and other similar ones, were met with a quick response by Housekeeping. The breakfast, included in our room rate, was a pretty good Continental served in the downstairs bar by a very friendly, competent server. Yogurt, fresh fruit, bagels, bread and sweet pastries, as well as coffee and premium tea are available. The front desk service was wonderful; compliments to Bianca for her friendly and knowledgeable demeanor. All our questions/ requests were always met with a smile and a quick solution. She even provided us with poppy pins to commemorate Remembrance Day (Veteran's Day in the US). We had a car pick us up and drop us off at the Toronto Pearson airport; the hotel arranged this for us (courtest of Raja) and the cost ($75 Canadian from the airport and $55 Canadian to the airport) could be paid separately or added to the hotel bill. The hotel is located just three minutes' away from the Hockey Hall of Fame---great location! It is also possible to access the city's extensive PATH system (the underground shopping/eating area used to get through the main part of town in the cold, snowy winter) from quite close to the hotel. Using the King Street entrance (one block from the hotel) I walked underground to the Eaton Centre (the large mall on Yonge Street). There are restaurants, food courts and washrooms all along the way. The hotel is also about four blocks away from the popular St. Lawrence market, which is open every day except Sundays and Mondays; it is a great place to get an inexpensive, but tasty breakfast or lunch or just do some sightseeing. All around a great hotel with lots of extra amenties that we wish all hotels would offer! We didn't utilize the spa or bar but both looked modern and quite popular. One drawback--like most busy cities Toronto is quite noisy and we found that our ninth-floor suite was a bit too close to the street noises for our comfort. We will ask for a higher floor next time.

We had hoped for a high floor and we were on the 9th (not too bad in my opinion, but the front desk repeatedly apologized about not being able to book it higher). Upon check in, we received a relaxation CD and chose our incense that they would bring to the room each night (which was inconsistent, but still a nice gesture). The front desk staff and housekeeping were the only ones really really interacted with and they were great for the most part. I did booked a massage in the spa and thought their facilities and staff were quite nice too. This place, like others have mentioned, is a great location... we walked everywhere for four days. One of the days we took the subway to Yorkville and the entrance was right around the corner from the hotel. Its right off King Street and just far enough away from the hustle and bustle. The only con about that is that the parking structure was a few blocks away (which is awkward with luggage!). The rooms are really nice and have full kitchens; a luxury we didn't feel we needed but ended up enjoying the fact that we had it. Personally, I loved the feel of the rooms, but don't be surprised, they are pretty small... think like, New York City studio apartments. I happen to think that's cute, but some people (like my 6'1\" 200+ lbs husband) might not agree =) The only real complaint I had was that we had a terrible time sleeping our first night... we checked in after 2am and were exhausted after a long drive, but there was SOMETHING going on below us (in this little nook between all of the buildings- directly below our balcony, check out my pics). We never figured out was it was, but I think it had something to do with the dumpsters... were they dumping garbage, compacting garbage, moving dumpsters, I have no idea, but it was very loud but we were too tired to even call anyone (my guess is that they were getting calls from other guests though).

We called down to have someone clean the shower and change the sheets. When he changed the sheet I noticed that the mattress pad was stained with similar stains from the sheets which grossed me out. He was just going to leave that as it was and place a new sheet on the bed. It was so disgusting that I asked for that to be changed as well. From then on (we were there 3+ nights) there were stains on the sheets and/or pillow cases every time our sheets were changed, which I DO NOT expect from a 4 star.

I booked the room through Travelocity for a better rate, then called to specify a smoking room. There are only 5 smoking rooms in this hotel (7th floor only) so make sure there's availability before you book. I believe all smoking rooms are deluxe level rooms. My room wasn't ready when I first checked in (arrived at 11AM) but they stowed my luggage while I went exploring the neighborhood. When I returned at 1:30, my room was ready and my luggage brought upstairs. Having just come from the sister hotel, Pantages, I was a little disappointed when I saw no shop in the lobby, but the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages. The first thing I noticed was the separate bedroom, rather than a studio. Preferable when having guests over for dinner. Unlike Pantages, this room has a mini-bar fridge, rather than full size, so get the mini-bar key when you check in if you think you'll need the extra space. The kitchen is nicely appointed, and there are loads of items for purchase if you so desire. In addition to the fridge, there is a 4 burner stove, microwave, dishwasher, pots/pans, coffee maker, electric tea kettle, toaster and service for 4, including glasses and stemware. Plenty of cabinet space for your groceries. It's just a short cab ride away from the Metro supermarket. The freezer is narrow so keep that in mind when purchasing frozen items. They might not fit. The beds are firm but very comfortable with Egyptian cotton linens. The bedroom has its own television so there's no fighting over the remote. Located under the nightstand, I was pleased to find an air cleaner. Never see those in hotel rooms. The bathroom was smallish and contained a glass enclosed shower stall. I was a little confused why there was a faucet in the shower stall, but it occurred to me that because you need to step in completely to turn the water on, it allows you to correct the temperature so you're not drenched in cold water. A nice little consideration. In the living area, there's a loveseat lounger and desk with chair, complete with CD player and relaxation CDs. Separating that from the kitchen area is a breakfast nook with lovely bamboo plants. Overall, it was a nice simplistic design that had \"Zen\" written all over it. Very soothing. For added convenience, there is a washer/dryer combo hidden away in the closet. The turndown service is a nice touch as well. A healing stone is left on your bed, along with incense. You choose the scent when you check in. I prefer Ocean. Overall, I was quite pleased with the room and service.

I was charged a fee of $2.00 to take $$ out on top of the $1.50 charge I get from my bank for using an independent ATM. The second room on our reservation had to do this as well. This amounted to $10 in extra fees and they refused to take it off the room rate. Outside of the room, was a terrace where a high school graduation party was held. It was very disruptive and the music and teens could be heard clearly even with the windows closed. The other guests in my party had two men walk into the room while one of them was in the shower with the door open. It was only an hour after check in and they did not knock. Two females were staying in that room and they were very disturbed. When my partner opened the blinds to the balcony, the metal header fell down and narrowly missed her head. It did strike her foot, gave her a good scare and take a chuck out of the floor. Looking at the mark it made I was thankful it missed her head!. When I let the manger know at check out she was rude and I found it to be of little consolation considering everything we had been through in our short stay.

After researching rates with the online websites, I called the hotel directly and negotiated a $179 a night rate for a suite--nice! The best I could find online was $184 for just a room. The location is superb...convenient to the Harborfront, but far enough from the gritty end of Yonge Street--an easy walk to King Street E. and W. Colbourne also has some nice restaurants on the street within a couple hundred feet. Overall, I can't say enough nice things about the place but several things stand out. The room was beautiful--sleek, contemporary and comfortable. The staff was delightful and sincerely nice. Even when the service was quirky in the restaurant or the bar, the folks were so genuinely solicitous you couldn't help but smile. Make sure to ask that they include the continental breakfast, which was very good and more than enough to hold you. One added bonus: Upon checking in, the desk staff offered a 50% off discount coupon for the upscale restaurant in the hotel, which we accepted. We had a fine meal for a reasonable (by Toronto standards) price. Note to travelers who've not been to Toronto in a while...prices on lodging, food and drink have gone up, up and up. There's even a liquor tax now and no more tax refunds at the border. Tip: Park in the underground parking garage at the end of Colbourne Lane and Church Street. You can't miss it. Our bill for parking from 6:00 PM on Friday to 10:00 AM on Sunday was $16.00 total--what a deal!

Personally I stayed on the 25th Floor Room #2. Everybody was really happy with their rooms. As a group we travel a lot and have been in a lot of hotels. Everyone agreed it was more relaxing to come here at the end of the day than a typical hotel as the room set up is better and you don't feel like you're in a hotel - more like you're crashing at your friends place. This is more of a botique hotel. Most rooms are like studio apartments (they also have some suites / larger rooms). They have a small kitchen area - stove top, microwave, dishwasher, small fridge, cutlery, pots / pans, coffee maker, toaster etc. Living room area has a desk, flatscreen tv, two chairs, kitchen countertop with two bar stools. Floors throughout the room are laminate wood floors with a couple of throw rugs. Decor: Modern and contemporary. The furniture looks like it comes from West Elm - if you like that style you'll like the decor. Storage: large closet with good storage space in the hallway. There is an in suite washer / dryer in every room. Plus iron and ironing board. Bathroom: Walk in shower, floor to ceiling tiles, bowl sink, standard toiletries. Two bathrobes in room Bedroom: I had a separate bedroom with a door - small but fine. Had an additional smaller flatscreen tv in there. Bed was comfortable, 4 pillows, bolster, duvet - no bedspread or coverlet which I personally prefer for sanitary reasons. Balcony: some rooms have balconies - mine did but I would not say it was a space you would want to hang out in. No furniture out there and no real view since the hotel is in the heart of the city and surrounded by towers. More likely you would want to open the door to get fresh air (screen door) or step out to have a cigarette (a lot of the rooms are non smoking). Atmosphere: the hotel tries hard to make it a relaxing place for their clients. Thre is a water fountain in the living room, bamboo shoots for decoration, meditation (stretching mat), plus they will have the incense of your choice given to you during turn down service every night. Spa: They have a fabulous spa here in the hotel. Some of my colleagues used it and enjoyed it very much. A swedish massage is $110Cdn for an hour. I believe that hotel guests get a 15% discount. Gym: They have a tiny gym here. 1 treadmill, 1 eliptical, 1 bicycle, 1 bench with free weights, stretch mats, and 1 combined weight machine. Staff: 10 star staff. Everyone is very helpful and friendly. All of our issues were dealt with promptly. We were greeted whenever we came back in to the hotel. Housekeeping: The rooms were clean. If you put your Do Not Disturb sign on the door they will respect it and not come in. Security: Very good. To access your floor you must put your card in the elevator to push your button. Peep hole in door, dead bolt, swing door guard plus digital safe where you program your own code that is big enough to fit a laptop. Downtown is a bit deserted at night. Main streets are fine. Internet: Pay for internet $12Cdn per day. Wireless available in rooms. Had no problems VPN in to work. Breakfast: available on the ground floor. I did not eat there but my colleagues did. This was their one complaint with the hotel. Cost was $12Cdn per day. There was no hot food (omlettes etc), Just toast, bread, and waffles. They used to have the hot food but guess they changed their menu. Nearby: There is a 24 hour Dominion Supermarket a couple of blocks from the hotel. Very large including vegan / vegetaritan foods, organic foods and all the other standard fare. There is also a 24 hr drug store - Shoppers Drug Mart one block away on King St. ATM - there is an ATM on the second floor of the hotel. Also several along Kings St / Main Streets of the city. Getting Here: To / From Toronto Pearson Airport it is a flat rate of $46 Cdn for the taxi + tip (no tolls). Average time is 45 min. There is also an Airport Express shuttle bus that operates every 20 to 30 min. Approx $20 one way or $30 rtn. They drop off to 10 different downtown locations. Airport: Note you go through customs in Toronto if you are coming / going to the USA so allow time in your schedule. When leaving Toronto the customs line can be quite long so don't show up at the last minute - you'll miss your flight. Things to do: the CN Tower for the view on a nice day is great. We had dinner in their revolving restaurant. It's a bit pricey. Food was not fabulous but decent, considering it is a tourist atraction. Service was horrible. Very slow. Think they are understaffed. You can organize tours through the hotel - including to Niagra Falls and in season to the wine area (some tours do both as they are in the same area). 75 miles away - 1.5 hrs drive. Shopping. Tons of shopping in the area. Toronto, known for its cold winters, has a lot of underground malls and people use these walkways to get between building downtown without having to go outside. All price ranges for shopping.

From how it's nondescript exterior and location on a small side street, to the small but very charming spaces. The lobby is small with a very friendly front desk staff. The rooms have a great vibe. First of all they are a full suite with seperate kitchen, hallway, bathroom and bedroom. Most rooms have balconies, but the hotel is crammed in between other buildings so you really don't have a view...and be careful about keeping the blinds open as there could be privacy problems.

There was a air purifier in the bedroom. All the floors are hardwood with shag area rugs. I have read comments about the blue pleather furniture. This is true, not comfortable stuff, but we did'nt really care. Also, we did not find the bed to be very comfortable, but I suppose they rarely are in a hotel.

All things considered, the Cosmopolitan was a fun stay and I would definitely stay there again on our next trip to Toronto. Lucy at the front desk was friendly and accomodating almost to the point where I felt guilty. I could not find a phone book in the room and needed a map of the Air Canada Center to see where our hockey tickets are. I called the front desk to ask if there was a phone book in the room and they said that there was, but if I could not find it they would bring me a map. I could not find the book and chose not to call and bother the desk. About 5 minutes later, Lucy at the desk called me back and asked if I had found the phone book. When I told her that I had not, she personally brought me up a map. This was just one of the little things that made our experience special. By the way, I found the phone book about an hour later.

I had friends over and there is really only the couch and two bar stools and an ottoman. There is definately room for atleast 2 normal chairs. The internet service was kind of annoying, you have to call in everyday that you want the internet on for them to connect you.

In other matters, one of the days i noticed that one of the trashcans hadnt been emptied so i mentioned it while i was going out about town, it was taken care of by the time i got back.

Not just nice, but a unique experience in the heart of the city. The hotel was one of the highlights of our visit to Toronto. BASICS: The Cosmo is a 27-floor hotel, with 5 rooms on each floor. The room prices rise as you go to a higher floor. We reserved a room in the middle price range, but the hotel upgraded us to the 26th floor. We could see the lake and had a great view of the CN Tower outside our windows. The building is somewhat hemmed in by others, so the upper floors really offer an advantage when it comes to the view. ROOMS: The room itself offers a truly comfortable queen bed, a separate living area (but inexplicably, only one chair), a full kitchen, and a 7-ft. high fountain! We had two flat screen TVs -- a full-size TV and a smaller one in the bedroom area. The only negative is a shortage of closet space, but you can use the washer/dryer in the room and simply bring less with you. It's a trade-off, I guess, because you'd get more closet space if they didn't have a washer and dryer. The kitchen has all the utensils, wine glasses, dishwasher, stove.... SPA: We had a couples massage and cannot say enough about it. The atmosphere in Shizen Spa is relaxing, the staff friendly and professional. The private treatment rooms are gorgeous and go quite well with the hotel's zen-inspired themes. DOKU 15 RESTAURANT: We had some excellent sushi and a couple a pricey (but tasty) martinis in this ground floor restaurant and lounge. Apparently, the restaurant is separate... we could not bill the meal to our room. But the restaurant also took care of us at breakfast, with a U2 soundtrack during our meal. The breakfast menu is self-service with excellent coffee, bagels, pastries, pancakes, and a small assortment of cheeses. STAFF/SERVICE: Excellent! I ordered a special package one evening, and it was perfect down to the last detail. I left the wine in the car, and they brought it up within five minutes. The staff is prompt, courteous, and efficient. Turndown happens between 6pm and 7pm...in lieu of chocolate :-(, they leave a stone on the bed. It's very zen, apparently. We also got a CD titled \"Peace Beyond Stress\" -- you get the idea. LOCATION: The hotel is one block from the Yonge Street subway line. It's only a few minutes walk up the street to Eaton Centre.

After searching extensively and reading reviews, I came across an Easter Weekend family package at the Cosmopolitan. I emailed the hotel using a link from their site to inquire about the package, adding another night's stay at the CAA rate, and whether their suites would accommodate a family of four (occupancy was listed as 2 people on their website). In the email response the person offered us a premium lake view suite for both nights - first night at a discount rate below the posted CAA rate, the second night for the advertised package rate. I did not receive a response to my reply, so after a couple of phone calls - never did manage to speak with the person who emailed me (and at one point ended up speaking with their sister hotel Pantages) - I finally managed to book our stay in a Premium Lake View Suite. For our purposes, the hotel has a great location - within a short walk of BCE Place, Hockey Hall of Fame, St. Lawrence Market and the theatres, shops and restaurants along Front St. - and it is very easy to get down to Lakeshore to drive east or west. A valet greeted us when we arrived and helped us with our bags. Parking is in an underground lot directly under the hotel - accessed by elevator, so I felt our car was very secure. At check in we were greeted warmly and told that we had been upgraded to one of their larger suites. They also informed us the crib we requested was waiting for us in our suite. Our suite (four - there are only five suites per floor) was spacious and on the 22nd floor, with a gorgeous view to the south of the lake, harbour and southern city skyline. It was a corner suite - the windows on the west faced directly into the building next door, the architecture of the building was interesting, but we found it best to keep the curtains drawn on that side (as they were when we entered the suite). The weather was cold and windy, so I only just stepped out briefly on the small balcony, but the view was spectacular. The suite itself was very clean - everything had a 'new' feeling to it - the hotel only opened in 2005. We definitely enjoyed having 2 televisions and the kitchenette (microwave, sink, stovetop, bar fridge and small dishwasher). There was ample counterspace and cupboards in the kitchen area. There was a washer and dryer in one closet, although we did not make use of them. The washroom was only stocked with enough towels for two and it was a challenge to know what to do with our wet towels...but the shower was very nice - good water pressure with a rain style shower head. The soaps, shampoo, conditioner, etc. were good quality, from the Shizen spa onsite. There were two fluffy robes as well. The main bed was wonderful - the sheets were lovely - high thread count. They put a selected semiprecious stone on the pillow (part of their Zen theme) each night at turndown. Unfortunately, even though we had booked the room for four, the sofa bed was not made up, nor was any bedding provided in the suite. Very soon after I called to the front desk though, a very pleasant man brought up the extra towels and bedding and he made the sofabed up very quickly for us. We enjoyed continental breakfast (included with our stay) in the hotel restaurant Doku 15 both mornings - Illy coffee, selection of teas, great fresh breads and pastries, smoked salmon, fresh fruit and very pleasant, helpful staff assisting. We did not try the restaurant for dinner - it just wasn't suited for young children in the evening. At checkout we discovered they had overcharged us for the valet parking (we were promised $20 per night, but the charge was $29 per night) and we did not receive the gift cards or the milk and cookies for the children in the evening promised with the Easter package. When I brought this to their attention, they comped the parking for the two nights, without any quibbling.

Also, it was nice to have two televisions in the room, but they did go under utilized due to my constantly being out in the city.

This wasn't a big loss to me, as I didn't require it, but should I have had allergies, it would have been an issue. Another small thing was the balcony.

The suites are small apartments with a living room, small kitchen, bathroom, and separate bedroom. The decor is minimalist zen with hardwood floors, bowl sink in the bathroom, rain-style showerhead, a flatscreen TV in the bedroom and the living room area, bamboo in vases and a little mini fountain. Additional touches include a newspaper delivered every morning and little polished stones placed on your bed every night with a note that tells the \"healing powers\" of each stone.

The towels were large and nice and the room comes with two bathrobes. WiFi is fast and stable and easy to connect to. The bar and restaurant downstairs is very nice. What they didn't get quite right: This boutique hotel goes over the top to create this theme of serenity, but there are some basics that they missed. Because these are suites, each room is pretty small. There is no place anywhere to put your suitcase. There is a hallway closet and some shelving in the bedroom. But the shelving is small. I had to put my suitcase on the barstool-chairs in the living/kitchen area. There are blinds instead of black-out curtains in the bedroom. While these are attractive, there was still light, and quite a bit of it, coming into my bedroom. The bathroom was pretty, but a disappointment. There is no counter space to put your toiletries. The water pressure in the shower was low and unsatisfying. And there is no bathtub. At least not in my sweet. There was more mildew in the grout than I was comfortable with. The gym is too small. One elyptical machine and One treadmill. The lighting in the gym was also too intensely bright. Overall, it was the hotel's services that made it great.

We walked into the small, dark, obviously trying to be very, very cool lobby and he whispered to me that perhaps the Fairmont still had room. Luckily, we gave the Cosmopolitan a chance beyond the dark entryway, the trendy pod-like hallways and the model-wannabes working the front desk. Our room was a delightful surprise. I've read other reviews suggesting the rooms were small. Wow. Not my experience at all. My room was as big as your typical NYC apartment. Really nice kitchen area, with microwave, dishwasher, fully stocked cabinets with glasses, etc. Washer/dryer in the closet -- that was a first for me, and I've stayed at a lot of great hotels. Calm, serene, lovely living room with a flat-screen TV, a super-comfy bed, nice orchids & zen touches. It was cool, comfortable and altogether a great experience. Other pluses -- well-stocked, relatively inexpensive minibar (compared to the Fairmont and similar, anyway); secure access to rooms (have to use your room key to get to your floor); small but fine fitness room. Minuses -- slow housekeeping; \"too cool for school\" vibe from a lot of the staff; no view from my room (concrete walls; \"balcony\" was 2 inches wide.) But overall, a superb experience, an outstanding walkable location, close to the CN building, the St. Lawrence Market, the Harbour, the entertainment district -- and for us, a good value with the $200 room rate we found on Expedia.

However, our room was called a \"Premium Studio Suite\" which sounded like it would be very spacious, yet it was anything but.

The photos on their website are very decieving. The sleeping area was barely big enough for a queen-sized bed, in fact, if it had a regular TV instead of a flat panel, there would not be enough room to walk around the bed. Our photos show the real size of the room as compared to those on their website. Between the uncomfortable bed and the constant, loud noises we could hear from the alley, we barely got any sleep at all. The label \"suite\" is deceiving because there is no separate sitting area, just a tiny kitchenette (unless you pay for one of the more expensive suites). In the morning, all the hotel could offer us was to move us to a more expensive suite.

Having stayed at the sister hotel (Pantages) and Hotel Le Germain downtown we stayed here and found it to be enjoyable. Our room had plenty of windows, 3 tall ones in the bedroom, more in the liviing room plus balcony, and even one beside the breakfast bar. The living room had a nice flat panel tv as well as another smaller one in the bedroom. The balcony was small, but usable to stand out there and check out the view. The view requested was a lake view higher level which is exactly what we got. I think staying in Toronto as a tourist or even as a local one must remember that unless your hotel is right on the lake, lake view usually means partial because of the higher surrounding buildings everywhere. My suggestion is to check out the location of the building with regards to its closeness to the lake. The decor is fairly modern and contemporary. The kitchen is a good size with room for 2 dinner settings and then some, a stove top, mini fridge, toaster, and i believe there was a microwave. Front desk staff was good, met the requests on our reservations and checked us in 2 hours before the 3pm check in time. When we pulled up no one was outside to get our bags, we only had two smaller overnight bags though. If you pull up and no one is there to help, you can simply go in and ask and someone will most likely help you with your luggage. Room service was quick to give us a menu when one wasn't present in our room and was prompt, quick, and pleasant when delivering it. The Cosmpolitan uses Hot House as their room service food. We ate at Doku in the hotel and it was \"probably\" an enjoyable meal. I say probably only because we aren't huge Japanese food fans and it was mainly sushi and Japanese dishes so I can't make a fair judgment call on how the food was because i wouldn't know what makes good Japanese food to begin with. I can say the waiter was really helpful with food choices, reccommendations, and explanations if we asked any questions.

Should they be here?'. In fact, nothing was said at all and it was up to us to politely indicate we had a reservation Having just come from stays in Quebec at the Gault in Montreal and the Dominion in Quebec City, where front desk staff were so positively charming, friendly and helpful, we were completely underwhelmed to say the least. This attitude extended to no attempt to help with luggage and an incredibly lukewarm response following any subsequent contact with the staff through the stay. Their only concern seemed to be which calming essential oil we desired in our room of an evening. The breakfast personnel had obviously partaken of these excessively. Oh, and I suppose we should comment on the room. We elected to have one of the higher floor suites, for which one pays a substantial premium due to the supposed wonderful view. Lets say heart rates did not quicken a cent when the curtains were parted. Quickly one could determine a cost-cutting ethos had been implemented in constructing this hotel. The door to the bedroom was barely more than plywood and would not close properly. There was room enough for a kitchenette but obviously not enough for anything more than a standard double bed (forget king, let alone queen) nor for any shelf space in the bathroom to fit more than a glass of water. The 'balconies' were just unfinished concrete slab protruding from the room. Plasma TVs were in both living room and bedroom but the screen quality and channel selection meant they were both virtually unwatchable. We did have nice cocktails at the bar one night but at $1200 for 3 nights , that's alot to pay for a nice drink. Mind you, beware.

Just to give a bit of perspective on where I'm coming from, I'm a professional in my early twenties - the demographic this hotel is apparently trying to serve. SERVICE: Service was sort of akward.

I read a bunch of the other reviews before staying here, and I have to say that they seemed much more knowledgeable at this point in time - I got my incense delivered as promised. There is no more complimentary breakfast, as a sidenote. All in all, service did everything they were supposed to, I just didn't like their mannerism. ROOM: It looks pretty nice at first glance, but the sheets are nowhere near a good thread count. The bed was comfy enough but it sort of felt like a fouton. The plasma TV's were NOT of good quality. Not much room for clothing but lots of kitchen space. I was dissapointed that even the yoga videos were 9 bucks a pop, I'm not sure if this is commonplace. The fountain had an off switch thankfully, because it make me think i had left a tap running somewhere. OVERALL: Had some appetizers at Doku, quite tasty and pricey (tuna tacos were especially delish). Personally, i think they overcharge for its apparent \"boutique\" appeal. You could stay in a much comfier room with more value added at a similar price somewhere else. Of course it might not be as \"cool\" as the Cosmo so it's up to you. I stayed early in the week so I didn't see what the night crowd was like later in the week. I personally would probably not stay here again. It's just not worth 250 bucks a night in my opinion...

The location is central - the next block up is the Drug Mart where you can buy items (microwave ready food) for the microwave or fridge... Up the block on Yonge, are lots of fast food restaurants (McDonalds, Quizno's, Mamma Mia Pizza) and a mall next to The Bay Dept store.... Because its close to all the banks on King St West, there are plenty of cabs to hail for different areas around Toronto. This is not a full-service hotel but if you like privacy and some modern amenities and like to make your own travel/dinner plans, Cosmopolitan is a great place to stay.", "Date": "February 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, CA", "Title": "\u201cExcellent boutique hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4249957", "Content": "An exceptionally immaculate, lovely and gracious retreat!

I personally would rather them address me by Sir or Mr. Smith than use my first name! Both times I called reservations, the agent's tone of voice and pitch was up and down and the one woman repeated that she could not guarantee rates beyond this conversation (which I think is rediculous, hotel's don't employ that dynamic of a rate structure)! Getting to the hotel was something else, it is tucked away off a major street and has absolutely ZERO signage from any major artery. At night it is coloured this horrid green from major spotlights and is located on a dark street with no other traffic, as a woman traveller it was seedy to say the least! The check-in was silly, the agent seemed new, or needed more training. I requested a high-floor with a nice view, to which I was told \"sure\"! Where do they have me? 10th floor of a much taller building. The room itself was okay, but forget about entertaining or having room to lay your stuff out. The chairs are vinyl, the floors are laminate, not hardwood... so DONT let the other reviews fool you, those people must not know the difference between genuine hardwood and a big wood sticker! This hotel is trying desperately to be a chic boutique style establishment, but the staff and presumably management don't know the first thing about this style of accommodations. This place is a real joke and I recommend everyone steer clear.

I have never had such a horrible experience at a hotel in all of my travels. It's ironic that the entire theme of this hotel is relaxation, when in fact, it is the hotel that caused 99% of our stress on this trip. First off, when I made reservations, I asked specifically if there would be a sofa-bed. The answer: yes. In actuality: no. It was also the first question that I asked upon checking-in, only to be told that the suite that I booked did not have a sofa-bed and that it would cost an add'l $50 in addition to the $430+/2 nights (CA) that we were already paying; that's outrageous!! It's a good thing I thought ahead and came prepared w/ an inflatable queen- size bed and, believe it or not, it was 10x more comfortable than the bed in the room- be careful as you might break a rib if jumping on it too fast. (Note- there wasn't any sofa at all in our so-called \"suite\", only two chairs) When I called down for extra blankets- I was brought one and told that I could not have a second, that is until I complained!! Second, who ever heard of a hotel that does not provide parking, minimally for their guests??? We got directed to go to a ramp down the street who then re-directed us out because they too, had no parking!! We had to park 4 blocks away and what did we get, an in-sincere apology!! My opinion of this: the workers should give up one of their prime parking spots so the guests can park!! Third- the room is not nearly as spacious, soothing, relaxing, etc as they make it out to be. Have to keep your belongings and toiletries packed, as there is nowhere to put them besides kitchenette drawers!! For # four, I will list various problems. The refrigerator was locked when we first got there??; once unlocked, we loaded up our soda, taco salad, etc only to come back from a walk and realize it didn't work. We had to call our \"lifestyle manager\" who attempted to fix the fridg but couldn't, so offered to put our food items in someone else's fridge- are you kidding me?? That's gross!! We had to throw out the entire salad for risk of food-borne illness. Don't expect to need ice because there is no such thing as an ice machine down the hall- you need to call your \"lifestyle manager\" only to receive enough for 2-3 drinks. The hall light didn' t work, the balcony is big enough to fit one foot sideways, was told I couldn't have add'l extra towels/washcloths despite the fact we had denied housekeeping service the day before, and just because relaxation is their theme, I didn't even get the incense scent that they specifically asked to to pick!! But don't worry- you do receive a complimentary meditation CD. There isn;t enough music to calm me down at this hotel!! Not done yet!! Upon check-out, as I had done throughout my stay, I expressed my pure dissatisfaction w/my stay. Not once was I offered any monetary compensation, despite the obvious faults of the hotel. The reason, I booked through a third-party!! You have got to be kidding- a problem is a problem no matter how I booked the room!! To top it all off, I was denied any form of a receipt (I needed it to get across the border to get my GST tax back). Appearently, they don't give receipts. If you ask me, something is shady about this place.

Especially since there was a party on the condo terrace right beneath our balcony!)

I had to leave 1 night early as by that time, I was a complete basket case from this experience. It had nothing to do with the staff, bless their poor souls. Or any of the people, but rather, they advertised one thing on the internet and I received the opposite. My room had no ventilation. The bathroom was abnormally small. The bed had a winter blanket on it with 34 celsius heat wave. There were no fans available to plug in. There were no menus, no list of services, no restaurant, no bar, absolutely flimsy and bizarre lighting in the room. It sured looked good on the internet when I booked, think of that, some relaxing days at this supposedly Japanese retreat. My TV was so far away from the bed I couldn't watch TV in bed. The cool mahogany screen to give me privacy actually fell off the wall and landed on the bed, this is a 75 pound wooden door type screen! There were no curtains at all and the blinds made the room extremely dark, although the room was already dark. The hotel is still under renovation and construction, with piles of materials on floors and a danger zone. All the services advertised were not nearly complete. I checked into the Hilton at the airport for my final day. What a difference. And it was the same price! Except that the Hilton provided food, beer in my room, menus, phone books, and everything else a tourist needs. Really what a rip off. I even phoned the GM and demanded some money back. Still nothing and no accountability. What a bogus place. Words of advice: stay at the Hilton. This place shouldn't be open to the public. It's easier to just flush your money down a toilet.", "Date": "July 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rochester, NY", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely The Best Hotel The Cosmopolitan\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3685876", "Content": "Everything was absolutely wonderful.

The service was consistent from staff to staff. My wife utilized the life style manager to help us book a one day tour of Niagra Falls, and also received some other information about Toronto, in general. When we arrived at the hotel, our room did not have the advertised incense. After I asked for some incense, several staff went out of their way to help us get the incense. As far as the room itself is concerned, I really liked the decour of the room. The hardwood floors are very nice, the bed is a pillowtop and was very confortable for us to sleep in. The mini-bar was nice, with a nice romantic set-up. The bathroom was somewhat small, but it fit the overall presentation of the room. The only issue my wife had with the room was that it did not have enough space to unpack our clothes. The balcony was just ok, nothing special. The LCD\"s televesion were --- nice, though the televisions only had one remote control. Considering the location of this location, my wife and I were rarely disturbed, except a few sirens (but hey what do you expect with a busy downtown like Toronto). The continental breakfast was nice, they had fruit, coffee, tea, muffins, banana bread, and a few other items. I would score the breakfast and A-.
