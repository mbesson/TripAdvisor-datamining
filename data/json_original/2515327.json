The hotel is perfectly located-just 2 short blocks from the light rail train (which you can take from the airport), 1 block from the waterfront and maybe a 5 minute walk to Pike's Market. We looked at hotels next to/on the Market and I was so thankful we stayed a few blocks away. The Alexis is just close enough to the touristy stuff but also just far enough away from all of the crowds. The hotel is an older hotel with lots of charm and the hospitality of the staff is top notch. They treated us like royalty and we felt like they wanted our stay to be comfortable. We had a king room on the 2nd floor. The room was very comfortable and had everything you would need. It had a large bathroom with nice sized counter space and a huge drawer for all of our toiletries to be tucked away and out of sight. The bed was very comfortable and we slept great every night. I would say overall the room was maybe slightly smaller than some places we have stayed but it was not a problem. It was a tad loud being on the 2nd floor overlooking 1st street. It wasn't the end of the world-my husband could sleep through the louder car noise and I always sleep with ear plugs anyway! They would have let us trade rooms if we wanted to but in the end we stayed in our room because it felt like home to us. The bar connected to the hotel (called the Bookstore) was also just fantastic. Great cocktails, wonderful appetizers and just a comfortable place to relax and have a drink. We also ate Easter breakfast at the restaurant (called the Library Bistro) and the food was delicious. All in all it was a great trip and we would definitely stay here again in a heartbeat!!", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Pierce, Florida", "Title": "\u201cFun, Artsy, Well-Located, and Oh So Comfortable\u201d", "Author": "BuzeeBee", "ReviewID": "UR127550256", "Content": "If you'd like to stay in a place that has guest comfort on their priority list, look no further. The Alexis Hotel will not disappoint. I like the fact that they also take dogs, of all sizes (no weight restrictions), even though I have never brought my dogs. It just feels more chill here even though they have an extremely clean, professional demeanor. From the moment you're greeted at the door, you do feel as if you've stepped into something of a sanctuary . . . away from the bustle of city life. Perhaps too, this has something to do with all of the books and magazines that are used for decoration and for your edification. It's delightful to be able to snag a book in your room, the lobby, the Library Bistro, or the Bookstore Bar and sit down and read it while you're there. I mean, how cool is that? The internet is not free here unless you're a Kimpton member. But, it's isn't difficult to become a member. So, I suggest that, before you go, get online (if you can) and check out what it takes to become a member (if you so desire). It wouldn't hurt since Kimpton tends to be a pretty good brand all around. The rooms are incredibly delightful as well. If you get a chance to return to Seattle several times, you'll notice that every room is quite different. And, amongst other amenities, if you've forgotten your socks, don't worry, a pair of soft, warm ones are hanging in your closet. Not to mention the robes and slippers, in every room. Many of the rooms also have wood burning fireplaces! On a rainy day, pick your book, a glass of wine, and curl up in front of the fire. When you travel as much as I do, these simple pleasures do not go unnoticed. The food in the hotel's restaurants is delicious. I can highly recommend just about anything on the menu. And, you won't be disappointed with portions. There is also a spa connected to the hotel, with a small steam room, that sells Aveda products. Their services are very nice. And, don't miss the \"Hosted Wine Hour\" in the lobby every evening from 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM. Note: don't miss SIFF (Seattle Film Festival). This is a great place to hang out during the film festival. Also, but of course, don't miss Pike Place Market.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Olympia, Washington", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Stay\u201d", "Author": "katyc18", "ReviewID": "UR127470476", "Content": "This was a second stay for my husband and I and it couldn't have been nicer.

I booked a queen/queen and asked for a larger room and was given a large suite with a separate tv room, which my girls loved. The staff were delightful and you get the sense that they really care. The little things matter and the staff here seem to get that hands down. After our first night I asked if we might move to a higher floor as I found the rumbling noise of traffic from the street was annoying and waking me up and was immediately offered a room on the highest floor. As it was a smaller room my daughters begged me not to move so we stayed put and I opted for earplugs instead. If you are a light sleeper you will be happier away from the road noise! Having said that it's the little things that matter, here are my suggestions for management that would elevate the guest experience to an even higher level and would have moved my overall rating to excellent 1. Long distance charges are way too high! Provide calls within North America free. 2. Please put a small bar of soap in the bathroom for hand washing. 3. Ditch the hard, scratchy dark robes for new plush and soft white or white background animal print (I envision white leopard print). No one really wants to wear a scratchy dark robe and it is better not to have them than go part of the way! I was very very happy with the customer service!!!

The rooms are very clean, spacious (don't know how people complain about space, even by American standards that's spacious let alone European tin can sized rooms), the location was just excellent and the hotel staff could not have been nicer. Located on First Avenue, a short walk from Pikes Place Market and even shorter walk to Pier 50 to take ferries across to West Seattle. Plenty of nice restaurants and good restaurants around with some of best night clubs in town a short walk away. The rooms were spacious, clean, modern and the bed was very comfortable. The Internet was fast and complementary for being a Kimpton InTouch member and even received a $10 minibar voucher as a gift for being a member. The only reason I signed up for the membership before arriving there was to get the free Internet but then started to see the benefits of being a member. The staff could not have been any nicer anywhere I have visited in the world. They were genuinely happy and very glad to help and assist with any requests. I was always addressed by my name which showed the attention to detail they had. Employees in the Westin (anywhere on earth) would never be smiling as much as the employees at this fine hotel while maintaining full professionalism. After my stay, I received a letter from the management of the Alexis asking how everything went and the correspondence was both very professional and personalized. It felt like I was in touch with a human being who is very service minded and who genuinely cared. Unlike staying with other chains that unfortunately treats everyone just like another business transaction. I booked yet another Kimpton hotel in San Francisco based on my impression by this one and was also pleasantly surprised.

We needed to book a room for one night before leaving for Sea Tac Airport. While researching (on the train) I discovered the Alexis had a special room rate for people arriving on the train. I booked the hotel and upon arriving in Seattle found that the taxi ride was brief (and thus inexpensive) from the train station to the hotel. Before we had barely stepped out of the taxi, the doorman was there to offer his assistance. Upon checking in with a very friendly woman staffing the front desk, we admired all of the one of a kind art lining the halls to the elevator. We got to our room and I almost called down to the front desk to say that we had been given the wrong room. The lovely woman at the front desk had upgraded us to what had to have been one of the largest hotel rooms that I have ever stayed in. We walked down the entrance hall and the bathroom was on our right. It was a nice size and bright. The best part was that the toiletries were large scale so as to be more eco-friendly and not the smaller plastic bottles that are replaced with every guest. At the end of the hall was the main room and there was a very large round dining table with a large wall mirror behind it and a comfortable chair tucked into the corner. On the long sideboard was the most extensive array of snack food etc for purchase. Beyond this area was the four poster bed with throw pillows in abundance. The wall beyond the bed was floor to ceiling windows that looked out onto a red-brick office building so thus very quiet in the evening. The area at the foot of the bed was a sitting area. There was a large overstuffed chair, sofa, coffee table, flat screen t.v. and then a patio door. The patio was square and large with yet more seating. As we hadn't had dinner, we pried ourselves from the room and went back downstairs. The front desk woman took the time to make some great suggestions and we ended up around the corner at The Owl. The next day we walked up to Pike Place Market which was only about 3 or 4 blocks away with our loaned hotel umrella. Upon our checkout, the doorman called us a town car and made sure to update us as to its expected arrival. I cannot recommend this hotel enough. The staff, the accommodations and convenience of the area with its delightful shops are all worth returning to.

I already knew about the Kimpton hotels from a couple of stays in Portland, Oregon and we liked that they were downtown, close to Pike Market and had two queen sized beds which was rather hard to find. We called to ask about the size of the room as we were traveling with our 10 and 7-year old daughters and didn't want to feel like we were in a postage stamp sized room in the winter in case the weather was horrible. They took note of that and when we got to Seattle earlier than check-in time and called to see if we could get to our room early, the front desk attendant said we should wait until the bigger room was ready for us. Wow! They called my cell phone when our room was ready and it was beautiful and big with a sofa, desk, nice flat screen TV, and two beautiful comfortable beds. Best of all was there was a door to a deck outside. We didn't mind that it was January, it was so nice to walk outside of the room for a minute for fresh air. The wine hour was wonderful, a nice break from the afternoon walking around the city. When we went up to our room, we had someone knock on our door with fresh chocolate chip cookies and milk to welcome our kids. Another Wow!

Everyone was helpful whether we were looking for directions, a place to have dinner or coffee or just getting coloring books and crayons for the kids.

The Alexis was a short walk to the Aquarium, Piers, Starbucks, local shopping/dining, Pike Place Market, Monorail (to Seattle Center-Space Needle, etc.) and often had towncars waiting out front (transport to the zoo). We loved walking around Seattle in the snow, it was a great experience. We enjoyed dinners at Elliotts (highly recommended) and McCormick/Schmicks, lunch at Pike Brewing Co.

To my surprise, Ali emailed me back, letting me know that the fries were still available (and delicious) and that she'd keep an eye out for my package. Then I asked if I could give the Kimpton code word (if you don't know about the code word, look for it on their Facebook and Twitter - it leads to many nice surprises), and she said I could and arranged for an upgrade! OMG, our room was fabulous! It was a big suite with an amazingly comfortable couch, a great bedroom and even a dining room table. And on that table was resting a bottle of wine, some absolutely delicious truffles and a card from Ali with a coupon for free blue cheese fries! YUM!!!! The room had a peek view of the bay (I took some photos of the Bainbridge ferry coming in) as well as a nice view of the city. It's in an old building that's been renovated, so the layout has some quirks, but that's part of its charm.

Fortunately, the Alexis offers free coffee in the lobby, so all is not lost! The front desk staff is super-knowledgeable about everything both locally and further out. We wound up chatting in the lobby with someone who was looking for wine tasting. We'd just come back from Woodinville, so we had a lot to rave about with regards to wine - but it turns out the gentleman at the front desk knew TONS about the Woodinville wine scene and had lots of insights!

I've stayed at other rooms in the Alexis and never had that problem, so I imagine it is a quirk of that particular room.

He made us multiple dinner reservations and let us choose where to go, laid out options for activities for the day and sent us champagne to our room for our anniversary. He went way above and beyond the call of duty and made our stay one we will never ever forget. Thank you, Russell. In addition to the fabulous concierge, we loved the Alexis. It was walking distance to anything and everything - notably great restaurants and the pier. I would recommend the ferry to Bainbridge Island and the Underground Tour.

We are in the reception area, 4 bags, not clear where we even are, its pouring rain and no where to go. Not an offer of a coffee, directions or umbrella. I went to the doorman asked for the concierge, there wasn't one on right now he explained but they could give us a map and directions if we needed. He took us back to the SAME WOMAN that sort of checked us in. She now gave us a quick run down on where the Market and shopping were. They would now keep our bags and send to our suite. I could not understand why she wouldn\u2019t help us in the first place. Out into the rain we went. We arrived back around 4:45. The first lady was gone. We got our room key and headed upstairs. No luggage. We went back down stairs to find it. Front desk will now send up. We never did get the dining credit or instructions, and when we inquired about it we were told the restaurant was closed.

Definitely worth joining the \"In Touch\" loyalty programme - free wifi, and a voucher for the minibar. I also had a password from the facebook page, which got me a free cocktail as well. On top of this, I got upgraded to a fabulous room, which in all honestly felt more like a suite; four poster king-size bed, huge tv, spotless and well-laid out bathroom. The reception staff couldn't have been more friendly or more helpful, and made me feel right at home within minutes. I've stayed in a lot of hotels and I can't remember a time when I've felt so comfortable so quickly. I had drinks and dinner in the Bookstore Bar. It's a rare treat to find a hotel bar which is obviously genuinely a hang-out for locals too, but this was such a place. The Cosmos were excellent and the pear salad outstanding, and remarkable value. I felt absolutely comfortable in there as a woman travelling alone, and again, that isn't always a given. Bed was ultra-comfortable, and the room was very quiet, so I slept like the proverbial log. Breakfast was lovely, and I'd been so pleased with dinner that I chose to have lunch back at the hotel before heading back to the airport rather than eating somewhere else in town. The location is excellent. As well as being in easy reach of the buses and light railway, you are only minutes from Pike Place market and even closer to the brilliant Seattle Art Museum Also handy for the major department stores.

I replied and was honest that the hotel was great, but my experience was ruined by the problem guests and the hotel manager offered us another opportunity to try the hotel, and since we are close, we took her up on it. I am so glad that we did. The two rooms we stayed in were so different from each other, but both of them were clean, quiet and spacious. We were just so pleased with how all staff treated us and I was pleased that I voiced concerns and they were taken seriously by the hotel manager.

Two days before the wedding one of our family members called to pay for one of our nights at the hotel and NO RESERVATIONS! The person we worked with was less than helpful to fix the situation and the two other people we spoke with took a totally indifferent attitude, it was unbelievable. We had to resort to yelling at the person and requesting several times to speak to a manager, who has still yet to return my calls. In the end they gave us a room similar to the one I was supposed to have, but not without a whole bunch of unnecessary stress two days before my wedding. The suite that we had was beautiful, PNW ballet themed, and had a great view of the water. I found the front desk staff to be annoyed with any request we made, and we were not particularly high maintenance only asked for some extra pillows and blankets.

It was really funky in an upscale way. We signed up for the hotel's loyalty program and we were given a $10 coupon for free snacks from the mini-bar. My sister and I took advantage of the free wine (and beer) tasting every afternoon (5pm) in the lobby. We had some nice chats with the other guests at this time. We usually headed down to the lobby in the morning for free starbuck's coffee and tea. We ate a really nice breakfast in the hotel restaurant and I would recommend it highly. Two mornings we walked down closer to the Pike Place Market and ate breakfast at higher rated restaurants (from tripadvisor) but our most enjoyable breakfast was the one at the hotel. So I rated this hotel quite high because of the friendly and helpful staff, room decor, location and some of the freebies we received. The only negatives were that the work out room is quite small and really only appropriate for cardio. There were some free weights but no bench. The only other negative is the high cost of parking at this hotel( $36/night). We had driven to Seattle from Vancouver BC so we needed to park our car. We only used the car once during our 3 day stay so it was quite expensive to have it with us.

I recently reviewed the Monaco in Portland and could not say enough about how wonderful it was. I was looking forward to this trip with my kids (last time was just as a couple) due to the Kimpton Kids program offered at the hotel. Here is the program in case you are interested: For Kids Each child is greeted with a special KimptonKids welcome gift Comment cards just for kids to tell us what they thought about their stay A list of kid-friendly activities in the area includes parks, restaurants and enriching classes Child-size animal print robes are available for loan or purchase Back to my review: The Good: Great location Nice Style Huge room (chose the 1bdrm suite with sofa bed and 2 bathrooms) Treasure chest of small toys from which my kids could select something The Not So Good Let me preface this by saying that my reservations did specify that we were traveling with two kids 4 and 7. As part of the Kimpton Kids they offer Kids animal print robes. I guess I thought they would be in the room. Instead we had to call and request them. In all fairness the request was dealt with quickly and the robes were delivered. When it came to pulling out the sofa for the kids, we found there was only one extra pillow in the room. Once again we called and request was dealt with promptly. It just seems to me that if there are four people in a room, there should be four pillows. The Ugly When we checked into the hotel it was happy hour in the hotel lobby and there was a wedding going on. The desk staff seemed to be a little distracted. I approached one person and they looked away, I approached the other and had to ask them if I could check in. The wedding, however became a bigger issue. When we returned to our room on the 3rd floor after dinner (around 9:30pm), the turndown staff had left our clock radio on. Unfortunately this did not come even close to drowning out the music from the wedding two floors below. I am a very tolerant person, especially when it comes to someone\u2019s wedding but this noise was too much (I\u2019m not blaming the wedding but the hotel). I can\u2019t imagine what this would have been like in a 2nd floor room. I chose, however, not to complain since I really didn't want to ruin someone's wedding. I finally managed to get to sleep just before midnight only to be woken by an altercation going on in the hotel regarding some woman having a fit about her party being shut down by the hotel and was screeching that she didn't \"give a damn about the other hotel guests\u201d. This went on for a good 15 minutes. So basically it was a terrible night and I write this 3 coffees into my day. In all fairness when I complained to the front desk manager in the morning she was sympathetic and said that although she couldn\u2019t adjust our rate (we had prepaid through a 3rd party site) she would be happy to buy us breakfast in the hotel restaurant (although we had already made other plan). It is more an issue to me of how the hotel could think that anyone could sleep under such circumstances. It\u2019s made me re-think how I book a hotel room? Do I need to ask what kind of functions are going on? It seems a bit unreasonable. I know times are touch but perhaps a small hotel such as this (4 floors) is more appropriate for a wine and cheese function than a wedding with a live band or DJ playing the extended dance track. All said, yes, I will still try Kimpton again in the future. Their hotels fit my personality.

We were delighted to have the opportunity to return, now with our five children. Perhaps my sentimental expectations were too high, but we were profoundly disappointed. We had a an executive suite connecting to a double/double ($700 plus per night pre-tax) PLUS another double/double for our nanny (ANOTHER $320ish per night pre-tax) The service was terrible, with one little thing snowballing into the next and here they are: First, the hotel is on a busy downtown street with no pull-off area to unload a vehicle, I had to run inside to track down the valet during Seattle rush hour while my hubby and remaining family got honked at while idling in front of the hotel. Once in our rooms, the valet didn't bother to ask which bag went where -- just unloaded them all in the living room area. (i redirected). I asked abour our crib. He didn't know if there were cribs. He didn't know if the hotel had mini fridges available either . He said he would ask. He never did, so I tracked down the cribs. I was told by the front desk there were no mini fridges (i doubt this is true). We had two bath towels in each bathroom for a family of 7. I did get more 45 minutes after my request. The rooms have floor to ceiling windows. They are elegant and attractive. They are not practical. There is no closet or chest of drawers in the exec. suite bedroom (it's in the living area). The bed -- while comfortable -- takes up most of the room. There is only very limited counter space in the bathroom. It is an older tub shower. The worst was our second floor location directly above busy First Street. The first night (a Sat.) was unbearable. We couldn't sleep but the front desk said it would be better the second night (a Sun) as there had been a parade and festival downtown on Sat. The front desk manager said she'd look around for other available rooms, but never bothered to call back. Despite mostly great reviews on TA, the most frequent negative was the noise which most reviewers assigned to passing garbage trucks. I was told via email in advance of our trip that our room requirements left the hotel with no choice but 2nd floor (lowest floor) rooms for us. But I was also told the garbage trucks had been rescheduled and this was no longer a hotel problem. Nonetheless, at 3 or 4 a.m. both nights we heard something that sounded like a garbage truck! I did not get out of bed to verify. On day 2, I asked for fans which helped drown out the noise on night two. As we essentially had a 2-bedroom suite, there were three different TVs. All used different operating systems (lodgenet, etc.) so what was available on one was not necessarily available on the other. The maintenance man, originally summoned to fix the broken AC in one room, confirmed the other TVs weren't broken. He did not know why they were on different systems. On Sunday morning at 8:30, I went to the lobby for some of the highly-touted iced coffee. It is promoted everywhere as being offered until 10 a.m. on the weekends, including on a sign on the table where the coffee is served. The pitcher was empty. I asked at the front desk and was told there wasn't any more. I said you can't run out of iced coffee unless you've run out of coffee, which is impossible in Seattle. She insisted they were, so I asked to see the manager on duty. After a punitive 10-minute wait, the m.o.d. came out and said it meant they would have to brew more then ice it down (yes! this is the complex recipe for iced coffee). She said it could take several minutes. I told her we'd be in the hotel restaurant. About 20 minutes later, she did bring it to me. We also had 4 $20 restaurant vouchers for b'fast as part of our package. I asked if we could use them for room service instead to spare the other guests the agony of dining next to our boisterous clan of 8. We were told no, which is how we ended up in the restaurant served by a cheerless waitress who brought GLASSES of ice water to everyone , including our one year old and two year olds in high chairs. When we asked her to take them away so the kids didn't knock them over, she knocked one over herself, getting the table and two people wet. No apology, but at least she gave herself an 18 percent tip for our \"convenience.\" The hotel's listed amenities include turndown service at night and a newspaper in the morning. We received neither. When I mentioned this at check out, the woman behind the desk said \"you have to request those.\" How would one know to do this? The only \"break\" i caught was when I ran out of milk for our baby after 6 p.m. which is when Seattle rolls up the carpet for the night. The Bookstore Bar bartender had mercy on me and filled up my 4oz sippy cup gratis. BTW, it is a beautiful, cozy, warm and charming bar. If I were traveling with my spouse only, we definitely would have had a drink or two there. On the plus side, the hotel is convenient to Pike's Place. It does have a great bar. The beds are comfy. As I learned from other TA reviewers, you do get a $10 minibar credit and free wifi if you join kimpton in touch, which we did. You can check facebook for a password that will get you another perk. In July, it was \"flip flops\" which got us either two glasses of wine or a movie. No time for either but our tots enjoyed two half hour episodes of \"Dora the Explorer,\" which otherwise would have cost us $2.99 each (seriously).", "Date": "August 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel but quite pricey\u201d", "Author": "Munchkin033", "ReviewID": "UR116095671", "Content": "The location is absolutely fabulous.

Having stayed at Kimpton hotels in the past, and being a current Kimpton InTouch member, I was aware of the amazing accommodations and customer service that I could expect to receive. However, the Alexis was somehow able to still exceed those expectations. I had booked our King Deluxe room online (with AAA discounted parking) and at the time noted that this would be a special occasion. Upon arrival to the hotel, which happens to be in a great, highly accessible part of downtown Seattle, we we're greeted by Travis, a super friendly and informative valet/bellman. Through the duration of our stay, Travis was there to recommend activities and restaurants, answer questions and talk to us about our trip we were currently enjoying. Travis truly helped make our stay in Seattle so much more enjoyable! But this was just the beginning. Once at the front desk, we were welcomed with a friendly birthday greeting for my wife and a super smooth check-in. We we're given our keys and headed to our room. Upon arrival, we we're floored to see that we had been given an amazing upgrade to a one bedroom suite! This corner suite was beautiful and just happened to be bigger than many of the apartments my wife and I lived in not so long ago when we we're just starting out. We really enjoyed spending time lounging in the living room during our rests between trips to the waterfront, Pike Market, the amazing public library (a must see if you love architecture or taking pictures, or both, like us) or our small side day trip to Snowqualmie Falls. There was all kinds of art throughout the suite and our separate bedroom and classy looking bathroom were just the right size and super beautiful as well! Yet one last amazing touch to mention took place upon returning to our room on our stay's first night. We returned to find a Birthday note, fresh fruit and sparking wine to celebrate my wife's birthday... how cool is that? Many thanks to Louisa, a concierge at the Alexis, for making my wife feel so special! I could go on and on and on, but need to wrap this thing up! SO... if you're looking for a great hotel in Seattle that has it ALL, location, amenities, beautiful rooms and an excellent and amazingly friendly staff, I guess the Alexis is your hotel. It's really that simple. I'm SO glad we chose the Alexis as our Seattle home away from home! E.

Traveling with a very large dog, I thought we might be put in an older room. Well, I certainly do not think that this was the case. The room was beautiful and very spacious. We were on the 4th floor and the room actually had a tiny balcony that one could sit out on. The view would only be to the back of the Seattle Times building, but it was nice to be able to open the door and get some fresh air. We had the door to the balcony ajar at night, and I really didn't hear much street noise. Perhaps a siren, and seagulls in the morning. Blackout curtains keep the room dark, if you would like it that way. All of the linens were very good quality. My only complaint was trying the find a pillow I liked. There is a mixture of soft and firms ones. I finally figured that out the second night. True, the toiletries are in refillable containers, but who cares. The shower was huge, with a rainhead shower faucet. Placed in the room was a dog bed, 2 dog dishes and a couple of dog biscuits. One of them from a dog bakery, with the name of the hotel on it. Okay..if you don't like dogs, you'll see no positive in this. In the lobby there is a water bowl and a bowl filled with dog biscuits. As we left the dog in the car when we went out to eat, the valets were great at taking us down and up to the car, to deal with our dog. The front desk staff, concierge, and valets were incredibly professional. They were there when you needed them, but not overbearing. Staff in the Library Bistro were friendly and efficient. We ate both nights at the Library Bistro. Actually made it in for Happy Hour and then stayed afterwards. Food great and a good variety of beer on tap. Location was excellent for us. One block from the waterfront which is fantastic for walking or running. About 3 blocks from Pike Market, 3 to Pioneer Square. A little longer to the malls, but the buses in the the downtown core are free and easy to take. Yes, the parking is $36 but what major city does not have steep parking prices.

Our suite was huge, way bigger than we expected. The bedding was very comfortable, although the pillows left something to be desired...they were the feather type that have almost no stuffing in them so you really need a few. My wife is pregnant so she had to call down to the front desk to get some foam pillows sent up, which they did very promptly. Street noise was a minor problem, at least until the traffic died down, but that occurred reasonably early and it never disturbed my sleep. WiFi Internet was free if you join their loyalty program, which was A-OK w/ me. I hate when fine hotels nickel and dime you on stuff like internet when cheapy hotels just give you that for free. The provided soaps, shampoos etc were nice. This hotel has chosen to move away from the mini-bottles in favor of a large bottle they refill every day. They claim it is to help eliminate the wastefulness of all those bottles going in a landfill. I think it does that and probably saves them a boatload of cash at the same time. Either way, this is an example of environmentalism that I can get behind. My stay was not affected by this in the slightest, so bravo to them for eliminating waste in ways that don't sacrifice the quality of their service. The front desk staff was pretty friendly but the bellmen/doormen didn't seem too interested in doing their job. We found that they try to steer people towards the town cars (presumably because they get a kick back on) even though taxis are much cheaper. In several cases when we were leaving they weren't available to help hail a cab or anything. In a hotel that charges what the Alexis does, this doesn't seem like the level of service I expect. The doorman needs to stop flirting with the girl at the front desk and help me flag down a taxi...seriously there's a tip in it for you. We only ordered room service twice during our stay, once just for a late night dessert and then again for breakfast the next morning. In both cases, the delivery time was amazingly short....so fast that I had to hide in the bathroom with a towel wrapped around me while my wife let them in. LOL. I wasn't expecting them so soon. :) Food quality was excellent and the fast delivery made sure it didn't taste like it had sat around for a long time. I'd like to point out that the staff, overall, was very attentive (doormen aside). We had a couple small requests that were fulfilled immediately...literally as fast as someone could possibly do it.

I have made about 80 transatlantic trips to the US in the past 10 years and stayed at many hotels in this price and class range, and never ever stayed in a room so small. It is also badly designed for the small space. The bed has a metal four poster frame which blocks the already-tight squeeze past, and the chair at the desk at the bottom of the bed hits the bed if moved back. There is nowhere to put a suitcase without creating a trip hazard, and the TV must be observed from the bed or sitting right under it at the desk. There is a chair in the corner of the room, but rather pointlessly so as there is nowhere useful to put it. The room sizes are stated as 300-500 sq feet on the website. Including the bathroom space, I can't see how this room is much more than 230 sq feet and too much of that is taken up by the bathroom.

I am so so glad I booked my stay at this hotel. I absolutely loved the contemporary classic decor as this is how I'd want to design my home! The staff were always friendly and helpful from the time I stepped out of the cab, to check in, to housekeeping. I had originally booked the Queen Queen room, but thought I'd let my two friends have it, while I took the king bed room. My room was immaculate...super clean with bathroom fixtures which looked like they were hand polished every day! Best of all was the super soft and comfortable bed and sheets! I slept like a baby. Then, when my friends arrived, checked in, and opened the door to their Queen Queen room in the next tower, my jaw dropped and my friends were screaming silly at just how huge and gorgeous the room was!!!....did I mention that it was huge?.....Huge with high celings!....and beautifully decorated too! I was jealous, but my room was really nice too and located at the 4 storey front tower. The only thing you don't get at this hotel are views as they all face right into the buildings on all sides. And the only other complaint from my friends were the guests staying above them stomping on the floors for 3-4 straight hours early in the morning which I'm told was really annoying. They have a small gym with a few nice pieces of equipment. I didn't get the chance to use the gym as I already got plenty of exercise walking around town for a few hours each day. The hotel is located at a very convenient location downtown. Close enough to the shopping area and Pike's Place Public Market just 3-4 short blocks away. Plenty of excellent restaurants nearby too. The hotel has a dining bistro called the Library Bistro which only serves breakfast and brunch. They have excellent breakfasts here! In this same bistro they held free wine tasting sessions during happy hour. I'm not sure if this is a temporary or regular do for their guests, but it was great! When you think of wine tasting you think perhaps you get a sip worth's of wine in a glass, but no, you get a whole glass!!! At the front of the hotel there's a nice cozy little bar where you can also order food from the bistro till about 10pm. Nice little place to gather with your friends for drinks. Sometimes it was really packed and sometimes it was empty. The waitress we had was really nice and friendly and came to chat with us a lot...during the times it was empty.

It was a trip to visit our old favorite places. Since it was the weekend of the annual Bumbershoot music festival and Labor Day weekend as well, hotel rooms were extremely scarce, and I had planned the trip only a couple of weeks beforehand. The Alexis was one of the only hotels that offered a separate bed for my son with enough room to get around, at a reasonable (less than $300 per night) price for that time period. We ended up in an \"Executive suite\", which has a living room, fully separate bedroom, and dining/conference area. We put a rollaway bed in the living room (it supposedly had a sofabed, but did not, a glitch.) The arrangement was extremely comfortable for our four-night stay. The staff was friendly. There was coffee and tea in the lobby in the AM, and, for a change from most hotels, plenty of copies of the NY Times, Seattle Times, and Wall St Journal -- there were usually some left to take even in the afternoon! There was a guest PC with internet access at the front desk so you can print out boarding passes and quickly check email or find info online. The only real glitch was that the shower head did not work -- I took baths -- but there was plenty of hot water and high water pressure. (To be fair, I did not notify anyone about the shower head.) I had requested a room on a higher floor, but all they turned out to have was one on the second floor, so they took about ten percent off my nightly hotel rate. Great location -- walking distance to Pike Place Market, the waterfront, Elliott Bay Books in Pioneer Square and the good restaurants in Belltown. We even walked to Seattle Center, although that is about a half-hour walk even at a fast pace. You could also walk to the International District. Parking is a bit pricey - $36 per night for overnight guests - but the valet service was friendly and very efficient.

It was vast with separate bedroom and sitting area with chairs and sofa; a dining table and open fire, with easy-to-light logs provided. I've lived in smaller flats. Decor is contemporary without being too minimal and staff are all very friendly and helpful. The location is ideal, being equidistant between Pike Place Market and Pioneer Square. Both are really interesting, but attract quite a number of homeless people, which are not a problem during the day, but might be intimidating at night for some visitors. The monorail to the Space Needle is also a short walk away and a visit is a must for any Sci-Fi or music geek, housing two fascinating museums at the base in a Frank Ghery designed building.

When we had plumbing issues, the engineer was at our door in a flash, and he was really friendly. The not-so-good: Our bathroom had some issues. The sink stopper was jammed almost all the way down, so it took a really long time to drain, which I was willing to overlook until I realized that our toilet was clogged. Which made me wonder -- how did the person who cleaned the room after the last guest not notice that the toilet was clogged? Did he/she actually clean the toilet? So then I had cleanliness concerns, which made me stick with showers and skip the long bath I'd planned. And one of the bed pillows had an unpleasant sour smell to it, so I had to toss that on the floor. No way was I putting my head near it. I think they were pretty busy but it took three tries to get a dog bed brought up and it turned out they'd run out. Which is fine, it happens, but if they'd just told us that, we wouldn't have kept trying. (In the end, another dog bed turned up, so I guess the third time's the charm...)

As a valued Kimpton InTouch member, I originally made our reservation for one of their regular king size rooms (extremely nice for a basic room in itself) but decided to email the hotel to see if there might be an upgrade available that we could get. Well, the hotel responded by giving us a fabulous suite that had it's own bedroom with master bath/spa and it's own living room a 1000 sq ft home away from home! The best part of our stay was coming back to the room after dinner and the manager, Jenne, had printed a picture of our little baby girl from my Facebook page and had it in a frame by the bed as part of the turn-down service; this brought me to tears. What a thoughtful touch! We always enjoy our stay at any of the Kimpton Hotels but like the Alexis particularily for it's location (central to get to Pike Place Market in one direction and Pioneer Square in the other). We also enjoy the Bookstore Bar there in the hotel for a nice relaxing cocktail. The wine reception from 5-6pm is an added touch that we always enjoy at Kimpton Hotels. Russell, the concierge and host of the wine reception during our stay was really knowledgable on his wines and of where to go in Seattle for food and entertainment. We ended our fabulous weekend with breakfast at the Library Bistro there on the Alexis property. Ron, our server, was excellent as was the Brioche French Toast that I had (super yummy and my mouth is watering now!!!) and my husband said his breakfast was the best ever!

Back through the hall was a large master bedroom with a desk, a king sized bed, large windows and a big bathroom with a separate shower and jetted tub for two. The tub was huge and so relaxing. The service was great, it was very clean and the decor was nice. Upon arrival in to the room they also provided us with a dog bed and bowl to use during the stay for our dog which was great. I also liked that any type of room was dog friendly - they do have specific rooms in every category for those allergic to pets to stay in but for every category of room there are dog friendly rooms - a lot of hotels won't let dogs in the nicer spa suite rooms so that was great. There are no charges to bring your dog. Everyone was very friendly, quick to help out how they could and room service was excellent. Any time we called up for ice or any other service it arrived promptly. Location is super close to Pikes Market as well as lots of restaurants. The parking is very expensive for valet - 37 dollars a day but I guess that is to be expected staying in a large city. They also charge $1.50 for every local call you make so use your cell phone :) I have with the hotel in regards to traveling with a pet was the distance to an area to walk your dog - the closest grassy area was many blocks away, and at night if you are alone it can be a bit unsafe walking through downtown Seattle to get your dog out before you head to bed. If you don't mind walking though everything else about the hotel is great - but do take that in to consideration when traveling with pets.", "Date": "February 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Channahon, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cAmazing stop in Seattle\u201d", "Author": "Kitka2001", "ReviewID": "UR54375205", "Content": "We paid a great rate for a double room and were pleasantly surprised that upon checking in we were upgraded to a suite.

Part of the Kimpton chain of boutique hotels, the Alexis Hotel is located at the corner of First Avenue and Madison Street, across the street from Hotel 1000 and the \u201cTaboo Video for Adults\u201d store, and a block and a half south of the infamous \u201cThe Lusty Lady\u201d adult theatre. Nevertheless, the Alexis Hotel is ideally located for walking to the major downtown sites \u2013 including: Pike Place Market, the Seattle Aquarium, Pioneer Square, Safeco Field for baseball and Qwest Field for football. Ferries dock just a couple blocks away from the hotel, and it is a short 5 minute taxi ride to the cruise ship terminals. Unlike many of the other downtown Seattle hotels, the Alexis Hotel has character. Front desk staff told us that the building was originally built in 1901 and most recently renovated two years ago, in October of 2007. The Alexis Hotel is a dog friendly hotel, so we saw several canines during our stay. The Alexis Hotel staff were all pleasant and helpful. Because the City of Seattle had shut off the water main to the hotel for 4 hours the day of our arrival on January 1, 2010 -- resulting in some yellowing of the water and sediment when my wife filled the large soaker tub on our first night -- the hotel did not charge us for parking our car with the hotel valet \u2013 a saving of $36 US (plus tax) per day. We stayed in room 347, a 900 square foot one bedroom suite priced at $244 US (plus tax) per night. Room 347 was spacious, clean, and typical Kimpton funky. The set up of room 347 was a little strange, but given that the building was built in 1901, the renovation was no doubt limited by the physical confines of the building structure. Room 347 has a very large master bedroom, including a lovely red brick feature wall. The stainless steel four post king size bed looked almost lonely, given the size of the bedroom. My wife found the mattress to be too firm for her, but I had two very restful sleeps and I found the mattress firmness to be just right. The 32 inch flat screen tv (no high definition channels offered) was so far away from the bed that it was actually too small for the bedroom. The bedroom had a very large bathroom, with a triangle shaped two-person jetted Kohler soaker tub, separate shower featuring a Grohe rain showerhead, large marble vanity and beautiful black marble flooring. The living room featured a sofa, a couple of sitting chairs, a desk and a 40 inch flat screen tv (again, no high definition channels offered). Given the size of the tv, the 20 odd channels offered came in fuzzy and high definition was sorely missed. Furthermore, for some strange reason, the tv was mounted above the desk, so that viewing the tv from the south side of the living room was partially blocked by the contoured centre column/wall. There was also a two piece washroom off the living room, a mini bar, small sink and counter area, and a large balcony going nowhere (it opened to the interior of the building -- a concrete courtyard of sorts -- with views of the outside of other hotel rooms and a small patch of sky). Pros: 1. Great location in downtown Seattle. 2. Funky decor and character building. 3. Dog friendly. 4. Attentive staff. 5. Clean, reasonably priced rooms (\u201creasonably priced\u201d being a relative term for downtown Seattle). 6. High end \u201cAveda\u201d hair and bath products (your wife will thank you!). 7. Small but well appointed bar located at the main entrance to the Alexis Hotel (the \u201cBookstore Bar\u201d) and a separate restaurant (the \u201cLibrary Bistro\u201d). 8. Part of the Kimpton hotel chain of boutique style hotels. 9. Free wireless internet for Kimpton InTouch members (the Kimpton\u2019s free guest loyalty program). Cons: 1. Given the age of the building, we could hear the people walking in the room above ours. Nevertheless, on both evenings the nights were quiet and sleep came easy. 2. Panhandlers throughout the neighbourhood (albeit none in front of the Alexis Hotel itself). I should point out that this is a problem regardless of where you stay in downtown Seattle. 3. Expensive valet parking at $36 US (plus tax) per day (see my comments above, wherein our parking was comped by the Alexis Hotel!). 4. Despite having a 40 inch LCD tv in the living room and a 32 inch LCD tv in the bedroom, there was no high definition tv offered. Conclusion: My wife and I would (and will) gladly stay at the Alexis Hotel again. On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is \u201cterrible\u201d and 10 is \u201cthe best\u201d, I rank the Alexis Hotel at 8. Accordingly, I give the Alexis Hotel two thumbs up!", "Date": "January 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cWhat a pleasant surprise!\u201d", "Author": "Lune14", "ReviewID": "UR51080455", "Content": "I spent 3 days in this hotel last October. Though I wasn't very lucky with the weather - yes, it was raining in Seattle - I was quite happy that after much research and a good deal I landed at the Alexis. The location is great - 1st Avenue a few blocks from Pike's Market, plenty of restaurants and cafes nearby. When I arrived I thought I'd ended up at one of these old fashioned worn hotels, but it had undergone a great revamp in recent years. The room was nicely appointed, really big, very comfortable bed, nice bathroom. My only comment was that it was a bit too dark. Most hotels tend to be around this area, and being so close to the port you are bound to hear some horns from large ships at night, but it's not really disturbing. This is yet another reason to get the Alex (a 4-floor building) rather than one of these higher priced options with \"room view\", as you will get a view of the docks, which is not very glorious. I didn't use the restaurant, but I'd like to mention that their bar in front of the hotel looked really inviting. And it was always full of \"real\" people, not the usual scene that you get in the trendier hotels. Service was always friendly and timely, and the rooms were really clean. I'd recommend Cafe Fonte, 2 or 3 blocks away at 1st Av, which has a fabulous coffee ( you need to be really good to stand out in Seatlle) and a smart selection of meals (breakfast through dinner) and wine.

The staff was excellent, even when I realized I'd forgotten something in my valet-parked car, I had it in hand within ten minutes, and they were happy to do it. The hotel is also pet-friendly, and my friend was thrilled with how welcoming they were to her dogs, including putting their names on a welcome sign and offering them treats. The staff requires you to leave your cell phone number with them if you are going to leave the animals unattended, which is a nod to being solution-oriented if someone's pets get too noisy. They also offer 24-hour room service, which is really a plus for those late-night hunger pangs -- theres nothing worse than room service that closes at the same time as a restaurant! Being a Kimpton loyalty member gets you free wi-fi within the hotel, a newspaper, and we were given a $10 gift certificate upon check-in for minibar items, which included everything from nuts and water to disposable razors. You can join as you make your reservation. My only real disappointment centered around the room -- I'd opted for an discounted upgrade at the time of check-in if the upgrade was available, and no one mentioned it at all, and I forgot to ask before I got into my room. The hotel was fairly empty (the others on our floor were our friends) so I was disappointed that I wasn't upgraded. I was also disappointed that my \"city view\" room was looking at another building just a few feet away. The porcelain in my tub was chipped and the toilet ran constantly unless we jiggled the handle just right, which were two small flaws that really made me feel like home--which I can do at home, and not for $200/night! ;) I really suggest upgrading to a suite if you are staying -- the executive suites are amazingly huge and beautiful, the exposed brick is gorgeous. The fireplace suite is nice for entertaining friends in your room though it isn't nearly so large as the executive option.

We requested a quiet room in a quiet part of the hotel and they delivered just that.

Internet access was included with the room, which we quite appreciated. The one thing I liked least about my stay at the Alexis was the on-site restaurant. The \"Library Bistro\" was very disappointing mainly because it was closed at all times except for breakfast. There was a small pub-style facility also within the hotel that offered meals from the Bistro's kitchen, but it was always crowded in there and I generally don't like eating dinner in a noisy bar. It seemed odd that this spacious restaurant would be closed while the bar was overflowing with people seeking a meal (and not just a drink).

But if you go on vacation and want a bit of something with flair or je ne sais qois, go get it! The Alexis makes a pretty good attempt at an \"oh sweet!\" hotel stay. There's art on the walls, good color scheme, you know, a sense that you've escaped the institutional tan and orange and grey boxy landscape of hotel hospitality. Yes, in a way it has got curved lines -- in the funiture, pillows, textiles -- and is just that, girlie. Bec/ sometimes spare, modern minimalism just really doesn't cut it; it's just off putting. Esp on holiday! So that's how we chose the Alexis. The room itself was a deluxe king facing 1st Ave. (It was surprisingly well sound proofed.) Large, with a couch and armchairs, as well as a little work desk. Rich browns and super high ceilings, and exposed brick. It was CUTE. There were some plumbing design issues with the bathroom, but overall we loved the room and would have stayed a second night if we could. Loved the lobby visuals too. Second, it's a walkable location. While we stuck to a few spots, the highlights were certainly its proximity to the water/ waterfront with great views of the sound; to Pike's market although I disklike the dining options there; and to any number of coffee shops. These are probably embedded in the fabric of Seattle but still, being sufficiently caffienated would seem to be important to getting the full Seattle experience. The restaurants and coffee and music seemed to be in Belltown, about a half mile walk. A pleasant walk, but watch for the homeless folks who seem more up front with passers by than out east; kinda territorial too. The buses in the downtown area are all free from 8am to about 6pm, quite nifty and handy. Esp handy bec/ the hotel charges $35+ for parking a night. The not so good is that the concierge takes off at 6pm, exactly when he would be of most use. He was also never there when we needed him, like a reverse clairvoyance (for us, not for him probably). Anyway, didn't get to try room service or the restaurant downstairs. But it's great for location and a bit o' style.

This hotel stretches across 3 old buildings. I was in the \"north tower\", where the plumbing and air conditioning worked well. While the decor was excellent, the bathroom was very small.

The fitness center is a small room with one recumbent bike, 2 ellipticals and 1 treadmill, and a small fan on the floor.

We came here on vacation for a special occasion, so we wanted to splurge a bit. Let me preface to say that my husband and I are globe-trotters and travel extensively. This would have made our 5th visit to Seattle. THE GOOD: Location: Cannot ask for a better location. Within walking distance to Pikes, shopping & restaurants. Close to all the action but not in the middle of it \u2013 perfect! Would prefer to stay in this area from here on. Hotel Staff: Got prompt and courteous response from manager. Cleanliness: Lobby & public areas were great. Room \u2013 well\u2026..needs improvement. Library Bar: Great service, great drinks. Parking: If you don\u2019t want to pay for the valet, there is plenty of street parking at that area underneath the bridge. If you wait till after 4, you can pay for 2 hours of parking (time limit) and 6pm to 8am is free! THE BAD: Housekeeping: came & went at inconsistent hours \u2013 either early in the morning or as late as 6:30pm. When we happened upon her at 6:30, she wasn\u2019t even finished and just had her take off than finish. After 4 nights, they never cleared the foyer table of an ice bucket and soda cans/ wine bottles. A clearly visible watery mess for 4 days. If not for us, think about that lovely furniture getting water-logged! One day we found dirty linen lying in the middle of the hallway. Bellman: At arrival, our taxi dropped us off at the entrance near the Library bar. This is one floor below the rest of the hotel. Although the bellman was there to greet us, they did not carry our luggage up the steps and there was no elevator. Needless to say, I\u2019m one of those gals who bring baggage heavier than themselves, so this was not a good start. Concierge: MIA. Apparently out on vacation and not another one to fill in during his absence. So much for using this service for our pampering holiday. Mysteriously, we did get a note in our room upon our arrival from him congratulating us for our special occasion. Nice touch, but who really wrote it?!! Room Amenities: With all my travels, I never got an option of a 2-floored room so I specifically got the room with the 2nd floor. I was expecting a 2nd floor but it was instead like a sunken room sort of thing. The living room/bathroom was 3 steps up from the bedroom area. When upon 1st entering, you have a large entry foyer that brings you towards a hallway with a \u201craised\u201d living area & bathroom, and then continues forward to the bedroom area. After 4 nights at this hotel, I hate to admit that we never used the living area except for to eat a snack for a few minutes. Also, with all the space, you\u2019d think that they\u2019d have a bigger bathroom, but it was a typical apartment size. Perhaps if that bathroom was as big as the entry foyer\u2026. Didn\u2019t get the king bed as described in room style. Got a metal queen canopy. Looked great, but that metal skirt / bottom area was a shin splitter more than once. Although there was plenty of furniture, there was no drawer space in any of it. The room was beautifully decorated albeit not well thought-out as far as usablity. Was relegated to using the small file cabinet sized thing in the closet under the safe. Still had to live out of the suitcase in my 650+ sq foot room. TV placement in the bedroom was in the corner. Unfortunately, the canopy bed poster always got in the way, so you\u2019d have to peek around if you want to watch TV in bed. Iron didn\u2019t work. Had to call twice to get a replacement sent. Both TV\u2019s didn\u2019t work upon arrival. Had to get maintenance to fix it. After a few days of running around, it was nice to have that option to watch a movie on demand. Paid for and started to watch Valkarie but after a few minutes of it on, the picture was shaking. Went to the other TV and saw the same shaky picture. Apparently we got the room with the crappy TV connection. THE UGLY: I can deal with all of the above I had mentioned, but this one was really unforgivable. The hot water was intermittent. Either of the sinks had hot water unless the shower was turned on. However, once you got in the shower, you\u2019d get the blast of cold unsuspectingly too. After telling the front desk of this issue on day 2, supposedly they had maintenance in there but still no resolution. Had cold water in cold Seattle in the early spring. Yippee. What did we get for our troubles? A $60 credit from the front desk at check-out (still spent more than $1000) and 40% off of our next stay. Whoohoo! Seriously?!! So as a Kimpton\u2019s InTouch member, I\u2019ll have to say that this room has been the worst Kimpton room I\u2019ve ever stayed at. The Monaco in Portland blew you completely away.

We used to have issues with the service at this hotel all the time which is why we switched for a couple of years to their sister hotels in Seattle- the Vintage Park and the Monaco. For this trip, I decided to give them another chance and try it again. Ugh. Pros: the remodel was good, they needed it and it looks good and is comfortable. We also got a steal on a king premier suite which made us super comfortable for our stay. Cons: room was a couple of doors from the elevator which wasn't horrible because the hotel wasn't that busy this weekend but I could see how it could be annoying if they had been more full. I guess somebody's room has to be by the elevator, right? The service- big problem. I ordered room service breakfast the first morning- lukewarm, gluey oatmeal missing the advertised currants. Later, I put my tray out in the hall and then stepped over it all day long when nobody came to get it for many hours. Then 4 times throughout the day, I returned from outings and found no doorman present. I'm not a princess and can open my own door, but when I'm weighed down with packages or need a hand otherwise, it would be nice. Two of those times, there was a valet (I think) standing inside the door TEXTING on his cellphone and he had the nerve to look up and say hi to me as I struggled past with my packages. Later, running late for a dinner reservation, we were thrilled with how quickly the valet was able to get our car when we called down for it, BUT when we got out to the street, our car was sitting there UNLOCKED with no valet in sight. I went back in to look for him to get the keys I found him chatting up the salesgirl working in the perfumerie off of the lobby. Are you kidding?! When we returned, from dinner, no valet in sight. I went in again to look for him and found him behind the front desk messing around on the computer and realized that he must have seen us standing around looking for him since he had a straight shot through the lobby out to the street and had watched me walk up to him. FRUSTRATING!! Housekeeping- I happened to be in the room when she came, but I sat in the living room reading the paper to stay out of her way so she could do her thing. She left us with TWO towels for two people in a suite, asked me if I was done with my room service tray and then left it after I said that yes, I was done and didn't run the vacuum even though the dark carpet was obviously in need. A couple of years ago, we had a true nightmare stay here- way worse than than the minor annoyances I describe here, but with some of the same characteristics- clueless valets and doormen, noise (plus a teenage party next door that they refused to break up but it went on all night, being put in a \"non-smoking\" room placed directly over the bar downstairs before there was a ban on indoor smoking, so the smoke floated up into the room and it reeked and they refused to move us insisting that we had been given a non-smoking room, asking the concierge for a recommendation for a good indian restaurant and being looked at like we were from another planet and told that Seattle doesn't really have that. Really? No Indian food- I doubt it, and I could go on and on about that visit). I contacted the management then and they were super apologetic for the problems we had and really did a great job of making it up to us. I just can't believe that two years later they are still having problems with service staff. You'd think they'd work that stuff out, but maybe it's just a pervasive problem in service there. I don't know if we'll stay here again soon. It's a shame because we find it more comfortable than either of the previously mentioned sister hotels but I can't justify paying these rates when I know for the same price at the W, the 4 Seasons or elsewhere, these service issues would not be tolerated by management.

I had to wait for nearly two hours for an ice bucket, they lost my car in the garage and kept me waiting in a cold December morning for 20 minutes while they searched for my vehicle. I complained to the reception desk and they became testy. The general manager did not respond for a month when I sent a complaint letter. Still not resolved with the Alexis. For more than $340 per night you'd think the staff would have been trained for more than Holiday Inn service.

I was given a suite on the sixth floor that was very nicely decorated with great furniture and cool art. It also had a great view of Puget Sound. The suite was huge with a nice bathroom, private bedroom, large living room and dining room.

This is a wonderful small hotel that I would highly recommend to the pickiest of travelers. It was the perfect overnight escape! The Aveda spa down in the lobby is very also very convenient. The Alexis is also a short walk to the Pike Street Market where there is lots of great shopping and restaurants!

We arrived 2 hours prior to check in and were met at the bottom of the stairs by a hostess from the Library Bistro who carried our suitcase up the stairs and stored it for us while we had lunch in the Bistro. Lunch at the Bistro was wonderful, our waiter was great (we had him both days we ate at the Bistro) and the bistro is a lovely relaxing place to eat. The steak was perfectly cooked and the profiteroles were amazing! The Front Desk staff checked us in early and they gave us the higher floor room I had requested. I had booked a Deluxe King but I suspect we were upgraded as our room was really rooms. We had a huge living room and dining room area with a couch and 3 chairs and a large flat screen TV. It was a corner room with window with huge windows overlooking downtown on two walls. We could even seen the harbor from our room. The view at night was beautiful. The rooms were gorgeous! I would have loved to have taken our floor lamp home. As a plus both the couch and the chairs were comfortable as well as being beautiful. The computer desk was great! Easy access for charger plug in and plenty of desk space. We had a HUGE dining room table which came in handy for our room service orders. Speaking of the room service it was wonderful. They are fast and friendly and the food options are yummy, even when you are calling them at 1 in the morning. It was really nice to be able to have an all night menu to choose from if you get in late and the butternut squash soup is wonderful! Our bathroom was gorgeous and had a wonderful rain shower and a nice long tub that you can get comfy in. Our separate bedroom had two huge windows with a gorgeous view. The bed was TO DIE FOR and worth checking into just to sleep in it or lounge around and watch our flat screen TV. Also the rooms had heavy silk curtains that totally blocked out light and made it so very easy to sleep in! The location of the hotel is great for a tourist visit. You are right by the waterfront with the boat tours and the pier shops as well as within walking distance of Pike's Place Market and Pioneer Square. Note to those who don't love to walk, if you take Spring St downhill to the waterfront you can walk to Pike on flat land. If you stay on 1st you will have a hill. If you do walk the hilly way go to Piroshky Piroshky in Pikes and reward yourself with baked good guilt free ;) The doormen were helpful as well for those times when we were too lazy to walk and wanted a cab and the concierge services we helpful with getting us bus information.

Close to anything you would possibly want to do in downtown Seattle. Just a few blocks from the water front, pioneer square and pikes place market. The space needle and big shopping areas are a tad bit farther of a walk but absolutely doable. The front door staff was very helpful when asked for directions or opinions on activities and always greeted us as we came and went. They were very quick to call a taxi for you and were just all around great people. The hotel was very clean and quiet. The only noise we heard was one early morning some pounding in the streets from some kind of construction. It was not related to the hotel or the hotels fault. We drove from Kansas (26 hours) so I really wanted to have a massage in our room but wasn't able to locate anyone who had any idea who I needed to contact in order to schedule one. It was listed on the room service menu so I know they existed. The attached salon is apparently not the correct place if you would like a massage in your room. I would have settled for one at the salon but they were completely booked for our entire stay. Oh well, it wasn't too big of a deal. I have only two small complaints. Room service is VERY expensive. All the delivery fee/service fee on top of the meal prices you will easily drop well over 50 bucks for a small meal/snack. However the food was very good and fairly timely. One night we ordered cookies and milk for a small dessert. The hotel didn\u2019t have any baked but said they were putting them in right away and would bring them as soon as they were done. We called about 15 minutes before it was time for room service to shut down for the night. About 45 minutes to an hour later they finally showed up with them. They were very apologetic and gave us a few extra cookies and didn\u2019t charge us at all for them because they took so long. Not only did they not charge us, but they even stayed late to bake them and deliver them to us. To me that is great service. They didn\u2019t wait for us to complain about the long wait, they were proactive in the situation and made sure we were happy. We wouldn\u2019t have complained anyway because we are very laid back people but the fact that they went out of their way to do that for us was very personal and heartfelt. The other complaint is when we were leaving we called ahead for our car to be retrieved. We waited the 10 minutes like instructed and then lugged our suitcases to the lobby. No one had any idea who was supposed to have gotten our car. We waited another 10 to 15 minutes for someone the find out who should be getting our car.

Room was beautifully decorated with modern art and 5 amazingly different lamps, plasma screen TV, and 3 large windows that opened wide to bring in the gorgeous city air. The bed was a dream to sleep on. Lovely cotton sheets and extremely comfortable mattress. Bathroom chock full of Aveda products, plentiful luxurious linens, phenomenal shower head with good flow. Love the robes that are available for purchase. Only 2 blocks to waterfront and 6 blocks to Pine Street (the Retail Core) and Pikes Market. The # 18 bus runs on First Avenue where the Alexis is located and is free in the downtown area. If you take the #56 bus just south of Madison and First you can get out to Alki Beach for just $3.50 round trip. McCormick and Schmicks Seafood Restaurant is the best for seafood and you can sign to your room at the Alexis. Restaurant is half block north of the hotel. Complimentary coffee in the lobby is excellent as is the complimentary evening wine tasting. Be sure to put an Early Housekeeping sign on your room door if you plan to return to your room midday otherwise you may wait for your room to be cleaned. Housekeeping Staff was flawless and paid attention to every detail. Stacks of New York Times, Seattle Times. and The Wall Street Journal are available for free in the lobby. I enjoyed jumping out of bed, grabbing a cup of coffee downstairs and bring the papers back to my room. A complimentary Seattle Times paper is delivered to your room daily. If you need quiet during the day and want to keep your windows opened, I would suggest asking for a room away from the front of First Avenue. That being said, I enjoyed my room facing First Avenue and the noise didn't bother me but I was not conducting business on this trip. Pet friendly, no hidden charges, makes this hotel the #1 pick in Seattle for me. I plan to frequent Kimpton when I can because of their strong committment to the environment and giving back to the community.

Two bellman were walking in the other direction, one said hello without smiling or really looking as though he wanted to say hello. When I arrived at the front desk, no one was there.

My departure was much the same. I was this time greeted but without a smile and hardly an eye contact. When I stated my room number, she said my last name, like it was a number. Had she put \u201cMr.\u201d in front of it, she would have been addressing me personally. I then stored my bag with the bell desk. Again no greet, just took the bag and was given a ticket. I asked if there was an umbrella I could use and was told, yep, over there and he pointed to one leaning by the door. Some may say that these are picky details. The truth is that I did enjoy my stay; but when it comes to giving an objective review, I feel that all the facts should be stated. This hotel has the potential to be amazing. I did get a good deal on the room but had a paid the full price advertised at $280.00 I would have been a little more upset.

The 'we' consisted of 3-52 yr. old women who have been friends since college. We have travelled together before and I do my best to find accommodations that are roomy with places to sit and relax besides the beds. We didn't book the room until May so our choices were limited, i.e. a King suite which had a sitting area and a pull out couch, would've caused the dilemma of who would sleep on the pull out? We decided on a 'Queen Queen Deluxe' because it was said to have almost 500 sq. ft. and we thought there'd be plenty of room. I initially booked it on the hotel's website for $346/night and later found what I thought were the same accommodations on hotels.com for $296/night. We stayed in room 309 and 'spacious' isn't a term I'd use to describe it. In fact, if we would've kept the desk chair at the desk, it would've obstructed the pathway from the sleeping area to the bathroom. Besides the desk chair, there was one other chair with an ottoman. However, we needed to move the ottoman into the bathroom because there wasn't any counter space to put anything on. There was just a square, pedestal sink above a cabinet and although it was lovely, it was highly impractical--especially for 3 women needing to use curling irons and put on makeup using the handy make up mirror provided. Even a single businessman would be at a loss as to where he should put his razor and toothbrush. The coffee pot was kept in the cabinet below the sink but where were you suppose to plug it in? You couldn't have set it on the floor because the plug wouldn't have reached the outlet. If you put it on the desk, you had to unplug something else and you also needed to pull the desk out to fit the plug behind it. Since I wasn't even sure the plug was long enough to reach the outlet, I didn't even attempt that. There wasn't a phone book in the room so when we called the front desk, we were told there usually is but they would send one up. When they did so, I suspect the gentleman who delivered it was looking for a tip but I'm not tipping for something that should've been in the room. Also, if 3 adults were booked into the room, why was it only set up for 2? What saved the stay was the friendliness of the entire staff and the fabulous location. We ate at the Bistro Bar and the food along with the presentation was excellent. Beware if you're thirsty tho, because you will wait a long time for drinks even if the bar isn't busy which was the case when we were there. Being 3 former bartenders, we agreed we never let anyone sit at our bar with an empty glass but this wasn't the case with the bartender we had. We had to ask for every drink and even if she wasn't serving a waitress or anyone else, she still proceded to do something, ANYTHING, before making our drinks. However, we did seem to find that to be the norm anywhere we went in Seattle. The time between order and delivery was always much longer than we felt was realistic. If the Alexis could provide us with more comfortable accommodations, we would most likely stay there again because of its very convenient location and friendly staff.", "Date": "July 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cUnder renovation - beware\u201d", "Author": "RHOBoston", "ReviewID": "UR7989994", "Content": "We were referred to them from another Seattle hotel that was full for the night we wanted to stay.

On the plus side of it, the checkin was great, the person at the desk friendly and helpful, and they even sent up a small bottle of champaign after they heard that it was my birthday. Very thoughful of them, and we had a great dinner at Place Pigalle, which he also recommended. Oops - but the fitness room was closed. - Do you have an alternate? oh yes, they finally volunteered, at a nearby gym, but they didn't give us tickets until we asked again. The wallpaper in one of the front hallways was stained, as were some of the carpets, leading to a general feeling that the property was just not up to snuff. He didn't let us know about the renovation, which was apparent as soon as we set foot on the elevator - it was sheathed in ratty plywood with a not-so-cute label pasted on it that said \"Creating a new artwork for you\" or something similar. The room was stark, with no artwork on the walls, although it was clean. Bathroom was ok. Nice TV's. No turndown service. 2 bathrobes. Nice touch, but there were three of us. We had to get our own pillows and blanket out of the closet and set up the bed oursleves for my son,, who was sleeping on the pull out couch. The next morning Sunday) at 7:30 the people started moving furniture into the hallway in front of our door, and the entire place was a construction zone by 8am. Nobody at the front desk even told us that this was going to go on. I went down and had my complimentary breakfast alone, served by a surly waiter. When my wife and son went down for breakfast, they were told it was not complimentary, and so they passed on any breakfast or coffee. When we checked out, the bill was full rate, and my breakfast was billed on it as well. We complained then and there, and they appologised, and asked us if we would like a comp room for another night, but we were only in Seattle for one night, and we wouldn't stay there again anyway. So they dropped the breakfast charge, and $100 of the room fee. Good effort, but not enough to make us want to stay there again. When we were checking out, the person said that \"this renovation is really awful\", running late, and was causing all sorts of customer problems. No kidding. In summary, for $499 (or even $400, our final room rate) this was deeply disappointing. The breakfast snafu, the construction, the lack of facilities, the dirty and stained public areas and the noisy rooms (we were on the 3rd floor) made this our least favorite hotel experience in years.

I'd say this hotel has among the best service of any hotel I've ever stayed at and certianly the best for it's price. Every single member of staff was great, from the valet who took our car to the front desk people to the phone people to the room service folks. When I say \"great\", I mean the staff was friendly, extremely responsive, and truly seemed to care that we had a good stay. They managed to make us feel that we were the most important people in the hotel all the time. Service speed was blazing fast. When we called down for an extra cot for the boy they had it up to us in a few minutes. When we wanted them to park our car, or get it out for us, they ran to do it. When we asked the front desk for directions they were right there helping us out, giving us a choice of maps. I could go on (I won't) but bottom line is some manager at this hotel is very very good at training and motivating staff. The location of the hotel is excellent. Only a few blocks from the Pike Place market where we like to go for breakfast. One block from the Seattle art museum (alas, closed until 2007) and generally accessible to downtown. Just down the road from Pioneer square. About 8 blocks from shopping. A little further from the space needle and similar abut you can still walk it, or walk part way and take the monorail (kind of fun), or just take a cab. The main room of the suite we got was huge. It was sort of sparsely furnished though, so did not fully take advantage of the space. But nice enough. The bedroom was smaller but big enough for the bed. The bathroom was sort of a dissapointment it that it did not really match the hotel. Small and sort of cheap. But it was new and clean, and was fine. The worst part of the room was the noise from the road. We were on the second floor (room 222) of the new part of the hotel and the road noise was quite bad. Trucks, cars with stereo systems going, motorcyles, and more, seemed to be right inside the room with us. They could use much better soundproofing in our room. The sounds did die down late at night and anyway I was able to fall asleep so I'd say it was more annoying than anything. I suspect rooms on the higher floors are quieter and next time I stay at this hotel I'll ask for one. You've got to factor in the price when evaluating a hotel. This one was a very fair deal for a large suite, in a great location, and with outstanding service. If I could give it 4 1/2 stars I would.

We chose the Alexis because of its reputation-good enough for the Sultan of Brunei-and because of its proximity to Pike Place Market. We found our room to be large but rather empty and stark. Being somewhat cavernous, we found, as we were trying to go to sleep, that every noise from the hallway echoed loudly in the room. We heard constant noise from the elevator traffic just outside our door as well as every knock on every door . We thought that by 2 a.m. the noise from the street below and the hotel guests would subside but we were wrong. The Alexis seems to be quite the \"Party Hotel\" on Saturday night. Finally, at 3 a.m. we gave up all hope of getting any sleep when the man in the room next to ours got into a fight with his partner. We called the Front Desk and informed them that we were checking out and going home so that we might still get a few hours of sleep. We were appreciative that we were not charged for our stay, however, we were mostly disappointed that no one from the hotel management staff followed up with us the next day or EVER. After serveral weeks, I logged on to my \"Kimpton In Touch\" loyalty program and sent an email to their corporate office explaining our poor experience.

For instance, after we checked in, we realized that we had left a few items in our car and wanted to retrieve them ourselves, but the valet was happy to do so and did so quickly. The room was superb, as it was both spacious and very well appointed. The ceilings and windows were very high. The bed was comfortable as were the pillows. We both loved the bathroom, which judging by the other reviews, must have been recently renovated. The bathroom was spacious and had sage green tile walls and a grey tile floor. The towels were white and fluffy. The fixtures were a shiny metal and the bathroom had a big glass shelf on which you could put your bath stuff. The featured bath products were Aveda, so I made sure to take those home! Both of us repeatedly said that we wanted our bathroom at home to look like this! We also took advantage of the complementary private sauna, which I believe is on every floor. One call to the front desk, and it was ours for a full hour. The sauna was spotless and beautiful. It looked as if no one had ever used it. The hotel was very very close to Pike Place and other attractions. Walking to those places was easy. We both wished that we could have spent more time here.

It included a desk (where my husband was able to get a lot of work done as it was quiet and separate from the main part of the room) and then a long decorative entry table. As you enter the main part of the room, there were two queen beds separated by another desk, two chairs with an end table (with quite a few magazines on Seattle) between them, the armoire with the tv, video game, and mini bar inside, then breakfast table and chairs. Up a few steps was the bathroom and a dressing room. The dressing room was about 10'x10' and had a wall size framed mirror. Very nice when getting ready to go out. Since we had our two children with us, the hotel brought up a rollaway bed so the kids could sleep separately. The rollaway was not the fold in half style, but rather a real twin bed. That was put in the dressing room. There was still plenty of room for all of our luggage in there as well. The room was well appointed, and while we faced the main road, we did not have any problem with noise. We also never heard a peep of noise from other rooms. The hotel bar, The Bookstore, was cozy and very nice. They have 64 single malt scotches, and some excellent cocktails. We had a very good breakfast at the hotel restaurant, The Library. The hotel lobby has a beautiful Chihuly glass art piece in the center. In the evenings, the hotel hosts a wine reception in that area with postcard painting. There are blank postcards set out with watercolors for guests to use. It was fun to see so many adults participating and mingling. The valets were very efficient and always friendly. The hotel location was perfect for us. We were able to walk all over the city center without a problem. About a block away was an internet coffee shop and also a drug store.

On checkout my bill showed the room rate at $139/night, which pleased me: that meant I had shaved my Priceline bid very close to the true bottom line. What I liked best about the Alexis were its great location, the quietness of the room, and the first class treatment I got from the staff. When the front desk found out I would be checking in on my birthday, they upgraded me to a view room on the top floor and sent up a bottle of champagne. That set a great tone for me. It seemed that every interaction I had with the staff from then on was positive. The staff appeared to be mostly in their 20s and 30s and they were cheerful, competent and confident. I was pleased the Alexis sits astride the intersection of four Seattle neighborhoods. Many good restaurants and attractions are a short walk away. Head down First Avenue a few blocks and you're in Pioneer Square. Go the other way and you're at Pike Place Market. Head east to Fourth and Fifth Avenues, and you're in the downtown shopping and business districts. Head two blocks west and you're in the heart of the tourist waterfront. The Alexis lacks a great in-house restaurant. I had a room service deliver a dinner and a breakfast and the food was perfectly fine but not inspired. However you can charge your meals to your room at several excellent dining establishments in the area.

The appointments were very tasteful and proximity to downtown allowed us to put off renting a car for a couple of days.

A note about Rental Cars: DO NOT rent a car if you want to spend a good deal of your time downtown - with the cabs and frequent busses, you would be wasting money and time trying to find parking. We had to rent a car to check out the San Juan islands and Snoqualmie falls. However, we were able avoid paying the hotel $26/day for valet by using off the street parking. The parking restrictions are only in effect from 8AM to 6PM. If you leave before 8AM you won't have to pay anything. If you return after 6PM (which is usually the case if you really spend some time at your destination), then there is plenty of parking right next to the Hotel (we got parking immediately in front of the door both nights) - and you don't pay anything.
