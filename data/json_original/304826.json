The conference was organized by Marmara University and the location was convenient. Check in was seamless as we had already reserved on line through the conference web site. We were taken to a corner 'suite' which was at best a small room with no suite in sight. The room had a coffee maker and a double bed which was pretty average in terms of comfort. The next morning we went downstairs to breakfast served buffet style. Very average offerings of cheese, butter, some jams, and honey, two kinds of bread and coffee or tea. The next morning my w\u00c4\u00b1fe supplanted the bread basket with a few awesome fresh simits from the simit vendor outside. And management added some fruits to the breakfast offerings. The next night we had trouble sleeping as the young people next door kept talking loudly which sounded like they were inside our room because the walls were paper thin. After I requested that they tone it down they complied only to repeat the act the next night. When we asked the front office people next morning to move us to a quiet room they moved the young people instead!!! Check out was a stressful experience as they wanted to charge us 120 Euro per night when the conference rate was 80 Euro. This for a hotel that we rate as 60 Euros, at best. Eventually the conference chairperson was involved and after back and forth telephone calls between the front office people and top management we were given a discount down to 90 Euro per night. They said this was a goodwill gesture. So the bottom line: There are much better hotels in Istanbul for that price but we really liked the staff.", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuwait City, Kuwait", "Title": "\u201cIt is nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "kuwaity-word", "ReviewID": "UR117269748", "Content": "Mim hotel has beautiful decoration.

So when compared to this the location was excellent, but otherwise it was not good. One night we where at a soccer game, where Turkey played Hungary, we decided to walk back as we could not get a taxi. When we got close to the hotel we meet several groups of young Turks, who we asked for directions, the all recommended that we took a taxi, as it qoute 'was a bad neighboorhood'. The hotel is located on a very steep road, there are no restaurants near by, but there is a pizza place right across the street, alcohol is served at the hotel. If you want a taxi you have to got the the main road near by, and hope that you can catch one (usually not a problem). So the surroundings are not to good, the htel it self is rather nice though, its maintained quite good, the rooms are very nice, the staff is usually very helpful, I recommend the hotel if you have to go to the hospital, if you just want to visit Istanbul you should find somewhere else to stay.", "Date": "February 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Skopje", "Title": "\u201cHighly recommended with outstanding staff\u201d", "Author": "LjupcoA", "ReviewID": "UR34724371", "Content": "In the past two years I have stayed in Mim Hotel several times. The Hotel is located in a superb location only 10 minutes from Taxim Square by Taxi and has its own shuttle bus. Inside it is very very clean and the rooms are surprisingly big and comfortable. Even my little son finds enough room to run around. The Hotel has excellent breakfast in the morning with variety of food for everybody. Hotel staff is outstanding and very helpful. They are much closer to a five star hotel. I would recommend this Hotel to anybody that needs to stay in Istanbul regardless if it is for a business or for pleasure.

For getting to Taksim, you can take a taxi for 6-7 YTL in the traffic time, or you can go up a hill for about 20 mins and get to the nearest Metro station. The taxi for the same route will cost you about 3 YTL. It should be mentioned that the hotel has free shuttle service for a route to important places which will go at 8:00 am and 19:00 everyday except weekends. At weekends more services are available. Also free wireless internet connection was available in the hotel! On the whole, I recommend the hotel!
