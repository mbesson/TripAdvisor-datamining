{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Location, Location, Location! I spent two nights in the hotel in October 2008. Staff was friendly, personable and very helpful. Rooms were basic but comfortable and quiet with a large shower (I was in room 26). There is a cozy sitting room in the lobby with travel books for your use and free internet. Breakfast is included. The best feature of this hotel is its location. You are within minutes walking distance of all of Florence's major attractions. You couldn't ask for a more convenient location. Friendly, clean, centrally located and a good value - enjoy!", "Date": "Oct 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR310268935", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "The_Scalded_Cat"}, {"Content": "Great location, OK hotel I stayed at this hotel in the summer of 2004. It wasnt terribly expensive and the location was perfect. The hotel is located only a few feet from the city center and Il Duomo. The rooms and staff were ok. We had a triple room which was spacious, along with a nice bath. The furniture was a bit outdated and uncomfortable. Nice view of the busy street below. The hotel did have a noticable oder. Another room in our party had major sewage problems with their toilette and had to be moved the second day. Breakfast was typical italian style; bread, cerial, meats, cheeses, and juices. Overall, the hotel was OK.", "Date": "Apr 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR752127215", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Joeitaly2001"}, {"Content": "Great Location! The hotel location was perfect and centrally located to all the attractions. If you want a clean and spacious room with bath this is the place. Our room had a mini fridge that we did not discover until our last day. The desk contained a cabinet where the fridge was located. Too bad! The bathroom style is open so there is no shower curtain or door that keeps the water from splashing all over the floor. If you can live with this minor detail than this is the place for you. We had free access to the internet which was very convenient. The staff was friendly and helpful and spoke fluent English.We would definitely return to this hotel in the future.", "Date": "Sep 27, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR524123680", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "txtravelinggirl"}, {"Content": "Excelente Excelente Hotel, muy bien equipado, las instalaciones en muy buen estado.

There is housekeeping service every day. The breakfast is as good as any other, generally. If you liked living in a dorm in college, you will like this place. However if you want to be treated like a guest, this may not be the place for you. The whole building smells, and the bathroom in my room was moldy. The room had a window facing a courtyard that somehow bounced every little noise around between rooms so that I could listen to my neighbors use the bathroom, burp, and talk late into the night. There was no hot water for a full day and then again the next morning, and the staff made no apology for that as they told me I could cart my stuff to a room on an alternate floor to use the shower if I wanted. Speaking of the staff, with one exception the reception staff was terribly unfriendly and did not like to be inconvenienced with questions. The man on the late shift was the exception - he was friendly and helpful. I stayed in several other hotels in France and Italy during the same trip and this was by far the worst.", "Date": "May 16, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR305954627", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Amazing Location I was pleasantly surprised by Hotel Maxim. My husband and I went to Florence for our honeymoon. We'd gotten a really good deal for our stay at Hotel Maxim, so we were expecting something crummy. Instead we got a really nice room with a fabulous location. We arrived a day early, and the hotel staff was really great about finding us a room. We stayed in their new section the first night, and I highly recommend it. The room was new, but still felt like we were at a small hotel. The next two nights we stayed in their older section, and while it was full of Tuscan charm, the bathroom isn't what most Americans expect (freestanding showerhead means the entire bathroom, including the toilet, gets soaked. The bathroom in the new section had a shower stall). The breakfasts were very nice and included coffee, juice, and pastries.As the title of this review suggests, the location can't be beat. You really are at the center of everything. Walking out the building, you can see the Duomo right in front of you. With that said, I wouldn't recommend driving to this hotel. There are just too many people on the street, and the people I saw driving looked so flustered, driving just didn't seem worth the effort.Next time I'm in Florence, I'm definitely planning on staying at Hotel Maxim.", "Date": "Jul 28, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR847917273", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "shanijp"}, {"Content": "Great location!
