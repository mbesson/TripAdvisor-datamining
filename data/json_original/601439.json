The Services the hotel provided were second to none and never seemed to much trouble. We asked the Front desk staff on a number of occasion about how to get to places and what they recommended, they spent time and effort showing us maps and drawing us diagrams. The hotel is in an exellent location, right in the heart of everything, We walked everywhere as everything was in walking distant. The roof top terrace is cute and gives you a great view.

My first impression of the street was that I would not want to walk alone late in the evening, but we were never out too late and it was never deserted, so this was not a problem. Having said that, little streets leading out from it made it ideal for pickpocketing and we actually witnessed a pickpocket making his escape. There was an old man who frequently loitered at the end of the road, flashing unsuspecting women, but he was not threatening and nobody took any notice of him. The hotel Reception had friendly and polite staff. I would describe the room as functional rather than cosy, but it was clean and modern, with a good shower. On the minus side, we had a room facing the interior - the window looked out onto a small quadrangle and a view of the walls and windows of the rooms opposite so there was hardly any natural light. The walls were thin, meaning that you could hear the comings and goings in the hallway and any sounds coming from the neighbouring rooms. The beds were rather firm. I cannot decide whether ours was double room or twin room because we had two single beds pushed together and made up separately; too close to be a twin arrangement, but I imagine not ideal for a honeymooning couple. There was also very little space for storing clothes if you were staying for longer than a few days - no shelves or drawers (and I had to ask for extra hangers, as there were only 3 in the wardrobe), which meant that anything that could not be hung up would have to be kept in your case. Although CNN and BBC were supposedly available we were unable to get these channels on the TV (I wanted to tune into the news), but this was not a problem - who goes to Barcelona to watch TV? Anyway, guests had free WiFi and two PCs at their disposal on the first floor. We did not take breakfast at the hotel - at \u20ac11,50 per person we thought it a bit steep - but there are plenty of other options in the area. There was no fridge in the room but it was nice to have a free supply of water in the fridge at the end of the corridor, and you were able - at your own risk - to use it to refrigerate your own drinks. The rooftop terrace and pool would be the ideal place to wind down after a day of sightseeing, although we didn't use it. It has to be said that it is very small and I imagine it would quickly become crowded in high season. It's also a pity that there is no bar on the terrace. Finally, we appreciated the fact that we could leave our luggage at the hotel when we checked out to enjoy our last hours in Barcelona unhindered before making our way to the airport.

First: the location is great for exploration of Barcelona. Carrer Princesa is a nice street, right in the center of the old town, close to important museums, sights and many nice squares with little bars and restaurants. The streets in front of the hotel (towards the port) are a bit more upmarket, with artsy little shops and restaurants, while the streets behind the hotel have a much more local and neighborhood feel. The location allows you to walk most of Barcelona (Barceloneta: 20 mins, Cathedral: 10 mins). But if you need a Metro, the Jaume I station is just 5 minutes away. The hotel itself is in a renovated old building, as it seems and has a nice roof terrace with a little pool. The rooms are quite small, and have a bit of a youth hostel flair. A bit too minimalistic... Our room was quite dark and had a window into a very small inner courtyard. If the window would be left open, the room would smell of kitchen fumes. At night you could hear the neighbors snore. AC was not yet swiched on, but outside temperature was hovering only around 20, so it was not really required. Bathrooms are OK, shower good. The soundproofing to the hallway is horrible. You can hear every single word or movement in the hallway. Unfortunately, the beds are also a nuisance. Spring mattraces with a sag in the middle. After three nights, I was feeling ready for physio... Nice touch: every floor has a big fridge with free bottles of water, where you can replenish your minerals. The hotel has a restaurant (Peruvian-Japanese) which we did not try, but it was alsways quite busy unitl late. We had breakfast there, which was a perfectly agreeable buffet, with pastry, eggs, juices, cold cuts, and the likes... All in all: the hotel is a bit of a mixed bag...

So I went a third time to the reception, asking for someone to check - the again very unfriendly guy at the reception gave me the same answer \"Si, si...\" I insisted that someone would check the heating right now, in my presence, to which the guy replied that it had been checked and that it worked perfectly - after 10 minutes of discussion he called someone to check with me in my room. The heating was (indeed) broken. They promised to fix it, and in the afternoon, the heating worked - unfortunately it did not work anymore during the night, which gave us a third night in the cold. The other day, I asked for another room, threatening to leave the hotel. So finally, we could sleep at least two of the 5 nights in a warm room. Besides the fact that we were not the only people complaining about the heating and that the hotel seems to have a serious problem with it, what angered me more is the way this was handled by the hotel. The personnel at the reception, and especially one Spanish guy for the morning shift was not only unfriendly, but at times even impertinent. The rooms were OK, and clean. Breakfast did not give a huge amount of choice, but was OK. Less OK was the fact that on the last day we had to wait 15 minutes before having a clean plate (no it's self-service, but no clean plates in the breakfast room). The hotel has 2 PC's with Internet access on the first floor - when we were there, one of the two PC's was broken (so was also one of the chairs lacking one wheel...) Overall conclusion: I hope and firmly believe that there are better hotels in Barcelona.

Overall I'd say it was a very good choice with 2 caveats, 1 major and 1 minor. The hotel has an outstanding location - literally a few feet from the PIcasso Museum in the Old City, a 5 minute walk from the Cathedral and a ten minute walk from Plaza Catalunya. There are tons of restaurants, bars, etc within a short walk. The lobby is small but pleasant, and secured after-hours. It is fairly modern and sleek. The hotel has 2 elevators, 2 computers with free internet access, and free bottled water for guests. There is a breakfast room but we didn't eat breakfast at the hotel. The staff speaks very good English and are helpful and professional. They requested a taxi for me on departure and gave me some good restaurant suggestions as well. The room was ready upon our arrival at 9 am, which was very nice. We had requested a crib in advance and they had the crib in the room, also very nice. Our room was a corner room on the main street (C/ de Princessa) with 2 large beautiful windows and a small, pleasant balcony overlooking the street. The room was floored in Pergo and did feel a bit like it was Ikea-furnished. The double bed is two single beds pushed together, but that was not a problem. The TV gets about 20 channels, about 2 in English. There is a safe in the room, no refrigerator. The room was a decent size for Europe, average to small by American standards. The bathroom was fine, the standard weird Spanish half-shower door thing which I've never understood, good water pressure and good lighting. The counter around the sink is too small and doesn't hold enough toiletries for 2-3 people. As for the caveats: Caveat #1 (minor): the beds are extremely firm. I mean almost rock hard, and I like firm beds. As I am a side-sleeper, this was a little tough to get used to and over 4 nights I had a sore neck several times. Caveat #2 (major): Our room was quite noisy. It faces onto C/ de Princessa, which is a single-lane, one-way street but a significant artery for the east side of the Old City. It's not that the street was actually so noisy; however, because the buildings are so close together, the street seemed to act as a reverbatory cavity, amplifying the sounds of voices, cars, scooters, recycling being dumped in the bins, and trash trucks/street cleaners coming through, especially at night. If you are a heavy sleeper or have a very good set of earplugs, this is not a problem. However, for our infant, it was a major problem, and therefore, it became a major problem for us! She woke up every night at 2 am (as people started coming home from bars and restaurants) and couldn't get back to sleep. We didn't ask for a quieter room, thinking we'd get used to it over the few days, but we never did. I'm not sure if there are rooms NOT on the main street but I would be sure to request one if you are at all a light sleeper. Overall we enjoyed this hotel and in particular the location simply cannot be beat. However, make sure you bring earplugs or look into the possibility of a substantially quieter room. We would come back if we could be sure of a quieter night.", "Date": "November 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAbove Average hotel\u201d", "Author": "McCann-Cheshire", "ReviewID": "UR21346021", "Content": "What makes this hotel different from the rest is the customer service, value for money and location.

I offer to pay for it but receptionist refuse to give it to me saying that i have to give my dress and housekeepers will iron it to me. I didn't mind... just it took them 24 hours to do it :) so I never wear the dress that night. And they charge about 10 euro.

The hotel itself was an excellent 3-star hotel - rooms are good with all the facilities and the bed was a really good king size. We were originally offered a room at the front of the hotel overlooking the street but it only had a (big) shower and as I wanted a bath they moved us to another room which faced onto a courtyard.

The terrace and pool area are beautiful and I imagine they are great in the summer - although the weather was lovely in January it wasn't quite swimming weather! We had dinner in the restaurant one night and the food was good and reasonably priced - my husband's main meal was a bit on the nouvelle cuisine side but tasted nice. We didn't try breakfast at the hotel - we found loads of nice cafes nearby for coffee and a sandwich. The only downside to the hotel is that you can't get a drink or anything from the restaurant outside of restaurant opening hours - we asked reception if we could have a glass of wine to take up to our room at about 7pm but they said we couldn't get one until the restaurant opened at 8pm. They seem to have strict rules as the night we ate at the restaurant we ordered a cocktail at 11.15pm but were told we couldn't have cocktails until 11.30pm - by which time we couldn't get the attention of a waiter to order one!

We both really enjoyed it. We both had single rooms which were compact but fine for a city break, and not bad compared to other hotels Ive stayed in, in Barcelona. Its reasonably priced and although relatively basic, its very clean and pretty stylish. As with the bedrooms, the bathrooms were compact but nice - although one room had only a shower, which was fine for me, but if you fancy a bath youd better request one. As with most hotels in a bustling city like this, there is a fair bit of noise outside both late at night and early in the morning. This wasnt a problem in one of our rooms which was on the upper floors, but it may be an inconvenience if youre staying on a lower floor and are a light sleeper. Still, as i say, this would be typical of a lot of hotels in the city. We found the staff to be very helpful and friendly and free internet access (with printer), along with complimentary bottled water in fridges on every floor, were real bonuses. Unfortunately we didnt eat in the hotel so i cant comment on the restaurant. The location is great, being both close to the tourist attractions of the Ramblas and old town and also handy to Barceloneta and the Port area. Jaume metro station is 5mins walk. There are plenty of great bars and restaurants in short walking distance and the surrounding narrow ancient streets give the feeling that youre having an authentic Barcelona experience. Id definately recommend the hotel for anyone on a short city break and Im booked to go back next week on business.", "Date": "January 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California/Italy", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel for the whole family\u201d", "Author": "LaBernardi", "ReviewID": "UR12521848", "Content": "We found this hotel by chance and how lucky we were! Just down the street from the Picasso Museum in the up and coming Born district, the location is perfectly located for walking and buses, easy to get to if your are coming in from Girona or walking in the Gothic quarter or close to the port. The hotel is modern, clean and essential with everything needed: hairdryer, flat screen TV with satellite in three languages, internet in-room and two computer stations and printer on the first floor. The staff is service oriented and friendly. Breakfast at the restaurant Colors next door was add-on but included croissants, bacon and eggs, cheese, cereals, fresh fruit and juices,etc. We stayed five nights (family of four) and ate there every day. We dined one night at Colors: excellent and well priced food and great local wine list. In sum this is home away from home...a great hotel and we travel a lot!!! Problems: small towels and the bed was a bit hard for our taste.

We were given a double room facing on the pedestrian road Carrer Princessa which is lively but not noisy as other streets in this wonderful city. The quarter El Born-Ribera is one of the most authentic, far from the mass touristic Ramblas, full of bar, taparias, restaurants and typical shops (there area couple of pastry-makers close to the hotel). The room was clean and large, with a large bathroom. The reception was friendly and helpful. We were surprised by the breakfast in the lounge bar: rich and good, even if they charge you it is worth of the money you spend. The nearby Estacion de Francia leads you to the main railway station of Barcelona Sants and to the airport. I strongly recommend this hotel for a short or long break. You are ten minutes' pleasant walk far from the Ramblas and near to all major attractions. If not, take the underground at Jaume I, just one minute walk", "Date": "December 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cClassy city hotel\u201d", "Author": "moulinal5", "ReviewID": "UR10779698", "Content": "Clean, bright, modern hotel in a traditional building in a narrow street.

We stayed in a large corner room facing the street. It was a little noisy at night, but not too bad. The room was sparsely furnished, yet very comfortable and the bathroom was large (especially for a bathroom in Europe!). The location of this hotel is excellent. It's very close to the Picasso museum (a must see) and it's one block from a metro stop, which is very convenient to take you to many of the sites. Las Ramblas is a 5-10 min walk from the hotel. There are several tasty restaurants within walking distance to the hotel. We were especially impressed with an Italian place called Murivecchi, just a block east of the hotel. Had excellent, authentic thin crust pizza there. If you love Italian food like we do, this place will rock your world. We were very pleased with the free bottled water in the refrigerators on every floor. And there are 2 computers with free internet access available to guests. The staff was very accomodating and helped us send faxes when business unfortunately intruded on our vacation... All in all, I would highly recommend this place.
