I would ask for a room furthest down the hotel as i imagine it would get quite noisy. The hotel isn't luxurious so I wouldn't stay here if you are looking for something a bit extra.

Although it's kind of a funny story now so it's hard to be completely negative about the place. Well the huge selling point is the location. It's about a minute up the street from the Forum, 5 minutes from the Colosseum, 5 minutes to the Birthday Cake. Really awesome location. What wasn't good was the place itself. Without explaining too much, I'll just say that seeing the night porter with only a towel around him was not really what I expected. The breakfast is horrendous. I don't know why they bother giving you two croissants that have come out of a packet. They're chewy and really minging. It was difficult to find also. On the main street (Cavour) its the end towards the forum and it's a big brown door with no signage (that I noticed). Then you enter and go in a lift up to the floor that the hotel is on. The room itself was a little small for how much the room cost and the bathroom isn't a separate room, it had walls but was just a raised kind of cubicle area in the corner of the room. The air conditioning was really good though. Looked pretty new. The things I liked about the place were the decor. Was kind of traditional looking. They key into the room was huge so there was sort of an air of authentic tradition. The bed was massive as well which was good after 10 hours walking around Rome. Of course the location was by far the best thing. When I think about it now, being so close to everything we wanted to do by far outweighed a bad breakfast and overpriced room. I don't think I would recommend it though. There's probably nicer places on the same road.", "Date": "November 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201clovely\u201d", "Author": "fijane1", "ReviewID": "UR118989530", "Content": "stayed here in July with family.

I was travelling with my son and had booked a twin room but was initially shown a tiny room next to the door with a double bed. The man said he had told them to make it a twin room but obviously they had not done this so he sent us away for 15 minutes and then told us to come back and then he would make another room available for us. we went away and had a coffee down the street and came back and were shown a different room which had a double and single bed in on the main road side . the overall impression of room 205 was it was very dingy and smelly but at least the towels and shhets were clean and it was a decent size. It had an old fashioned air conditioning unit that was very noisy. the toilet would not flush and my son had to get up and put his hand in the cistern several times to release the flushing mechanism ...not ideal when you are on holiday !! the shower doors and plastic sliding doors were very grimy with damp black marks along the grroves At 1 am the air conditioning stopped working and we had no sleep as it was a very noisy room on the road and we had to open the windows. Next morning the shower fitment was broken and we had to hold the shower head in outr hand to get a shower. I went to see the man and told him about the air con and he said it needed emptying which he did for us That night we kept the air con on and I got up at 4 am to go to the toilet and consequently stepped into a floor covered in water quite deep and consequently slipped and fell hurting my hip and leg. The man was no where to be seen so had to use the blankets and sheets and towels to mop it all up. We were gettig up at 6 am to go to pompei and so had to go and knock the man up and explain about all the faults( the hairdryer had also broke by this time also so with the flood, the broken toilet, and shower fitment it was not good ) He said he would move us to another room while we were out but no concern was shown for the fact i had fallen it was not even acknowledged. When we got back that evening they had moved us in to a tiny scruffy room that you couldn't swing a cat but after being on a trip for 13 hours didn't have the energy to argue any longer so just went to bed (oh and also the coffee machime wasn't working and as there was no tea and coffee facilities in the hotel rooms had to go across the road each morning to get a coffee) At the end of the stay i asked about a discount for the inconvenience of everything and she said no because \" it could have happened to me at home it was just unfortunate ..and she wqs letting us leave our bags there free of charge for the afternoon \" The only redeeming feature was the location ...do not stop here if you want a decent hotel aswell.", "Date": "September 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chilliwack", "Title": "\u201cGreat staff, great location\u201d", "Author": "AndyCatChilliwack", "ReviewID": "UR71295591", "Content": "Don't be put off by the weird cage elevator that you see after you're buzzed in -- use it to go to the hotel reception on the third floor (4th by North American counting) and don't carry your bags up four floors like I did.

I was a little nervous booking this hotel because it was very inexpensive compared to a lot of the other Rome hotels, especially considering the location. But, it was perfect. The hotel is just a stone's throw away from the Colosseum and the Roman Forum. Everything else is about a 15 - 20 minute walk (not including St. Peter's). It is on a very busy street, but seemed a pretty safe area. When we arrived in Rome, we took a taxi from the Termini to the hotel on Via Cavour. The hotel is a litte hard to see because the only sign is on the door and it looks like a regular building. You have to buzz the hotel from outside. We were lucky enough that an Italian woman was also trying to get inside and she communucated to the person that we didn't speak Italian. We just reiterated our name and they finally buzzed the door. We went up the elevator to the third floor and came to the Hotel Labelle entrance. It was beautful and cool (which we wanted because it was very hot outside). The hotel clerk spoke relatively good English. The only problem that we had checking in was that they tried to put us in a room that was already occupied. So, after checking multiple rooms, we were finally put in room 210. I was so relieved. I was worried we were going to have to find another hotel, but it worked out. The room was surprisingly large. It had a comfy queen size bed with a small twin next to it. There was a large wardrobe covering the length of the wall on the left with mirrored doors and three dresser drawers. A chandelier hung from the high ceiling. There was also a large dresser next to the door with a mirror. So, we had plenty of storage space for our clothes. The room had a mini fridge and a television (only showing Italian programs). The bathroom was small but managable. There was only a shower, which I expected. But, the water pressure was great and the water was hot. There was also a biday (sp?). The thing I liked most about the room was that it was very quiet. Besides the hum from our airconditioner, which was a stand up unit, it was so peaceful (until you open the window!) The staff was helpful, although we didn't ask for much. Our room was cleaned every day with fresh towels and the bed made. I think we made them upset because we were never out of our room before noon, and once they called to clean and we just told them no thank you. The only thing that was bothersome was that they would turn off our airconditioner when they cleaned the room and after walking around in 90 degree weather to a mild temperature room wasn't great. But, we would just turn it on again. The room never got hot. The only thing missing from the room was a clock. This was a blessing and a curse. It really felt like we were on vacation since we didn't have to worry about time, but when it came time to leave we worried that we wouldn't get up. But, no biggy - the desk gave us a wake up call and called a taxi for us. Tip #1 - the restuarant across the street - Massenzio's - is wonderful. Every time we ate there, and we ate there at least three nights, it was delicious. The waiters were friendly and it was pretty affordable. I recommend the lasagna al forno and the tarafuto for dessert! Tip #2 - buy the Roma pass. It gets you into museums, buses, and subways for 20 E for three days. It was invaluable to us. You can purchase them at most museums. You'll save a lot of money and a lot of hassle taking the subway. Tip #3 - watch out for beggars. We did have one holding a large cardboard slab try to steal my husband's wallet. Tip #4 - if you are worried about not speaking the language, don't be. Most restuarants have English/Italian menus and most waiters and store clerks speak English.", "Date": "June 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cStill happy at the little Hotel LaBelle\u201d", "Author": "memorymaker", "ReviewID": "UR7769711", "Content": "Since my original post in June 2005, ,,my husband and I have returned to the LaBelle three times, most recently with our family, 3 adult children and three grandchildren, ages 11, 8 and 2 years.
