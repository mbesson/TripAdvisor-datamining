I've worked in four star hotels before, and I know how hard of a job cleaning/maintaining rooms is. But there are no excuses for this. The bathroom was so dirty. There were cleaning soap residue (green) in the sink and on the soap holders, the inside of the bath was still dirty with soap scum and dirt (and unidentified hair, my worst nightmare). Also, one of my pet peeves, there were no washcloths in the bathroom, only towels. As for the beds, they were clearly done in a rush. The sides weren't close to be even and the bedskirt was stuck under the mattress on one side. The comforter not only are the cheapest I've ever seen, they didn't look fresh at all (different colour spots - not for the look - and thread sticking out of the pattern). After all this, I had to order room service (the area isn't exactly reassuring for women travelling alone - it looks like an industrial park) and had the Cesar salad, dressing on the side. When it came, I only had romaine lettuce with dressing on the side. I had to call back for them to (promptly-I must say) bring Parmesan and bacon, they were apparently out of croutons... There is one thing I must say, check-in was pleasant and effective and the staff is courteous. Their shuttle service is practical and offers pick-ups and drop-offs to the airport every half hour, even at night! I wouldn't recommend this hotel to my worst enemy.

There were healthier choices like fruit, juices, bread, cheese and coldcuts. The hotel's best feature was the shuttle. We had some initial confusion because we thought the hotel shuttle came automatically at certain times to the airport. We ended up waiting at the airport for a while until we realized we had to call it. The shuttle service also took us to the Metro and picked us up so we could take the subway downtown. One of the shuttle drivers was surly but there are unhappy people in every job. This hotel is not located near anything in Montreal. It's far enough from the airport and far enough from the touristy things that I would not recommend it for someone who is coming into town for sightseeing.

When we got to our room there was a blue rubber ducky waiting in the bathroom for her. This put her in a very good mood! Then, when the housekeeper came to set up her crib he said he forgot her special treat and letter so he left and returned 15 minutes later. He laid a small teddy bear and a letter in her crib. Needless to say my daughter's mood improved even more. The letter stated that they had diapers, bottles, bibs etc.. free of charge, by chance we had forgotten any of these items. We have stayed at many hotels domestically, and internationally with our daughter and no where else have we found so much thoughtfullness toward the smallest of travellers.
