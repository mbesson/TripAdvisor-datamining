Things this place is lacking in: beds are not up to what you would expect in a \"resort\". Time to re-evaluate the mattresses and old fashioned comforters folks! We also had two bad \"room service\" issues. When we checked in on Fri nite my step daughter called the pizza place on the brochure given to us by front desk. We were told the food would come from their sister resort a few miles away (Bahama Bay). After an hour+ of waiting we called to check on the order - they had a \"computer problem\" and lost our order. Ok, understandable, so we decided to give the \"sister resort\" food option another try the next day (last night actually). My wife and I were heading out to Disney for the night so we ordered ahead to pick up a pizza and salad at Bahama Bay. When we got to front gate, security guard acted very angry that we were wanting to come in to the restaurant without the restaurant having notified him. Once this was resolved we finally got to the restaurant to pick our food - it was not ready and we were told we could wait out by the pool for them to finish it. This was frustrating as we had called ahead hoping to expedite the process. When it finally came we decided to just eat out by the Bahama Bay pool but it was like pulling teeth to get silver wear, cups, paper plates for our pizza and salad. No concept of customer service. That said, the pizza and salad were great! We won't be coming back to either property because we can get better service (and better bedding) for the same price at a few other similar resorts in the area.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "kingston", "Title": "\u201cGreat villa\u201d", "Author": "ktownon", "ReviewID": "UR128164850", "Content": "Spent 4 days on a golf junket with Caribe Cove as our home base- spacious well equipped villa-lots more room than just the 2 of us needed.

After that, it worked just fine. One positive that turned into a negative - There is great outdoor lighting all night with security lights positioned frequently along every corrider. Unfortunately, the small bedroom with the twin beds did not have curtains over the window. Just a wooden blind wich did NOT keep the security light from shinning in all night and making it hard for our kids to get to sleep. Since the light was positioned right outside the window, it was really bright in the bedroom. We tried clipping a towel to the blind, but that really did not help much at all.

Positives: Huge suites! Our suite could take up to 10! We were pleased with 2 big bathrooms, that were clean and modern. Seriously affordable! If you are a family on a tight budget I would recommend Caribe Cove as you can stay for an inexpensive rate as well as prepare food in the kitchen - rather than eating out all the time. We ate breakfast at the resort, and then prepared our lunches for our day at the disney parks - saved us a ton and we ate like kings! The pool is low key and well maintained. A nice place to spend an afternoon relaxing. Loved the balconies. Screened in so the critters can't get at you. Was blissful to spend the early morning out there eating breakfast and the late evening drinking wine!! Negatives: Ants. Ants. Ants. So frustrating. I felt like I was camping really. If you didn't have all food in an airtight container you would come back to it (say a banana or an orange on the counter) surrounded by a ton of ants. They made little trails through out our rooms and honestly I found it rather disconcerting. I don't like having to worry about that sort of thing indoors. Maintenance came up immediately after we called them to spray... but then you have toxic crap everywhere. Something that needs addressing. The only other negative is that the beds need to be replaced along with the pilly linens. The beds creak with every movement and are hard! Not very comfortable at all. I wouldn't stay here again for this reason alone. In the end, I would recommend this place. For a family on a budget, this is the place, it is well maintained with the exception of the two above negatives. It is close to the parks, and is also conveniently located close to many amenities like grocery stores and restaurants.

Very spacious, comfortable and clean. Beds were great (not hard like some reviews would lead you to believe). The resort was very quiet and relaxing, however we found there was little to do. Although we enjoyed a few trips to the pool, it was not very big considering the number of buildings here. The resort would benefit from a tennis court, or basketball court, or shuffleboard area, or even a mini put area. Pool surroundings were very basic, although the \"infinity\" effect of the end of the pool was nice. The clubhouse has a dvd lending machine, which is free once you pay the daily resort fee (about $6 per day). This includes free phone calls within the U.S. A cleaning fee of $65 is charged to cover the costs of cleaning your room after you check out. You are responsible for making your own beds, washing your dishes, washing your towels (if you need to do so during your stay). Laundry soap and dish soap are best purchased at the local WalMart or Publix, located a few minutes away (quite costly at the resort office). The kitchen is well equipped, although we did not have a frying pan, so cooking an omelette was a bit of a challenge. We did enjoy sitting on the screened in balcony, where we watched the fireworks display at Disney each evening. Free Wi-Fi is available in the clubhouse, but not in the rooms. They were installing Wi-Fi capability in the rooms during our stay, but it was not available when we were there. Be prepared to do a lot of driving when you're here as the resort is off the highway and away from stores and restaurants. However, a quick drive gets you onto 192 or highway 27, where you'll find a Walmart (great for groceries, wine and beer), Target, Publix, Walgreens, etc. Further up hwy 27 is a citrus farm, where you can pick your own oranges. A customized school bus with big mag tires takes you around the grove and through a bog area. If you're busy all day at theme parks and just want to come back to your resort for a drink and a swim, then this is the place for you. The staff is very friendly and the woman selling theme park tickets in the clubhouse was very helpful and took plenty of time to answer all of our questions. One note of concern however: a security guard does NOT man the front gate. As a vehicle approaches, the arm of the gate simply lifts, and you can drive right in to the resort. Other resorts are very strict, and a non-resident cannot enter.

There is an Ethernet cable in the room but it only works part of the time. This place is more like renting a condo there is no maid service. However you do have to pay for a Maid to come clean the room after you leave. On the day of check out I left my video camera in the master bedroom in a drawer with the charger. I called as I was on my way home and asked them to check the room. I was told \"lost and found\" was gone for the day and to leave a message and they would call me back. I did that and did not hear from anyone until I called the following Friday. When I spoke to the woman in lost and found she stated there was no camera turned in. I said to her maybe they did check the drawer like I asked. She said that they have to check every drawer and than an inspector will go through and check every drawer after the cleaning crew. She stated she would check with the inspector and cleaning crew and get back to me. About 4 hours later she called me back and said neither the inspector or cleaning crew saw a camera. So I said either you think I'm lying to you or You have a thief working for you and if they didn\u2019t take it than they didn\u2019t do their job and check all the drawers. I asked her if the room had been rented since my departure which she said it was and there is nothing more she could do. I then proceeded to try and get a hold of a Property Manager or GM , they don\u2019t have either just a director of maintenance.

The apartment we were in was a 2 bed/2 bath ground floor apartment, which made it very convenient for us when we had to bring in the groceries or come home after a very very long day at the parks. We loved that the resort had a homey feeling vs a hotel feel. The apartment itself was clean, had more than enough space for the 4 of us, we had a kitchen, NOT a kitchenette.

Internet-wise, no wi-fi in the units but they provided the cable for the hook-up for the laptop (forgive the simplistic terms, i am not tech-savvy). Location-wise, this resort is close to everything: grocery stores are only about 1-2 mi east or west on Highway 192. All the Disney parks are about a 10 min drive. They had a small exercise room with only a handful of machines, the pool looked very inviting and not crowded at all. Sadly, we were not able to enjoy any of these due to our limited number of days in Orlando. My husband's only complaint is that there was no grill. It would have been perfect if there was one, even if it is for the whole building or even the whole resort. But this does not deter us at all from recommending this resort to our friends or from us wanting to go back to this resort the next time we visit Orlando.

This place made a great first impression! I am very happy to say that my stay here was just as impressive as my visits to view before the purchase! Our condo is a spacious 3 bedroom, 1600 square feet of living space. www.sunvillas.ca Master ensuite is huge, with large double sink vanity, jacuzzi tub, and large tiled shower. Patio door opens from 2 bedrooms to a screened balcony. Balcony overlooks wooded area, and is very serene. Yes, the beds are not the most comfortable, but many owners, including us, are in the process of upgrading to a great quality Simmons mattress in all rooms. Kitchen is very well equipped, including ice maker and filtered water in the fridge door. Having the full size washer and dryer is a huge advantage as well. Our unit does have free WiFi, which is a huge advantage to us, as the whole family travels with their laptops! The whole condo was immaculate for our arrival, and the starter supplies are sufficient. With the kitchen facilities there, you will want to visit one of the grocery stores nearby to have things on hand for your conveneince. Its also a good idea to bring things with you for your stay, like dishwasher tablets, laundry detergent, etc, if you will only need a small amount, as that would simplify what you need to purchase. The front desk was very helpful to our every inquiry. The resort fee of $5.95 / day covers free calls, DVD rentals, etc, but clients booking through an owner there have the choice to pay it or not, if they wish to avail of these services. The cleaning fee is mandatory, regardless of the number of nights, which may make a 2 or 3 night rental seem more expensive - but a cleaning fee for a condo is pretty standard, so should not be surprising. From other reviews here, it seems that folks who book through third party operators like Bookit or Expedia types are not informed of it, which is where the problem lies, not with the resort, as this is clearly outlined on their website.

As soon as I opened the door to the \"villa\", I knew that all the great reviews for this place were not unfounded. It completely felt like a very clean, spacious 2-bedroom apartment (which is why I put \"villa\" in quotations--it's really just a nice apartment, but I guess that's what a small villa is anyway). Most noteworthy is that the villas are nearly fully stocked--you get your basics such as soap, shampoo/conditioner, towels, beach towels, iron, hair dryer, and you also get a fully stocked kitchen with plates, glasses, silverware, microwave, coffee-maker, full-size fridge, toaster, pots/pans, and a washer/dryer! So this place is *clearly* bank for families looking to save money on things like eating out. They do not have extra luxuries like toothpaste, disposable toothbrushes, razors, shaving cream, etc., but that's just something useful to know in advance, not something you actually need them to provide. Also, there's a Target just a mile away, so you can easily pick up other extra amenities like dishwashing soap (which they provide a very small packet of), extra coffee/tea (they provide a small hotel-sized pack of these things with the coffee maker, but not a large amount). Anyway, since lots of people have already commented on other awesome specifics of this place, I just want to throw a couple of the negative things about this place out there because I didn't realize their significance earlier. First, know that they charge you a one-time $65 cleaning fee at the end of your stay (in addition to the $5.95+tax nightly resort fee), which is a significant charge and should really be advertised up front in the cost of the place (I didn't know about it until after I had made the non-refundable booking, but this place was still more cost-effective than all the other places we were looking at for a party of 5 people, so I didn't throw a fit about it). Obviously then, if you are thinking about reserving for a few nights versus longer, choose the longer stay so that you can maximize this charge; they do not however clean your place on a daily basis, so whatever mess you make is yours to live in for the duration of the rental! Second, lots of other people have said this, but I have to say this again because it is so significant--the beds suck. Everyone in my group was shocked that everything looks so great from the outside and they clearly invested a lot in decorations, etc., but they couldn't invest in good mattresses? (which is actually one of the most important things on a trip--a comfortable bed for a good night's rest after a busy day). Anyway, we all woke up with back-aches in the morning. Luckily, the location is very quiet and you can adjust they temperature in the apartments, so those other types of things that contribute to quality of sleep were very much intact. Lastly, Wi-Fi is free in the reception area, but you have to use ethernet in your room. If you want to use their computer in the lobby, you have to pay for it (which I thought was weird). The staff wasn't really that friendly, but they answered whatever questions you had in a succinct manner. Yes, parking is very much free. They offer tea and coffee for free in the lobby. Overall, despite the few negative things, the cost-effectiveness of this place won out hands down and I would definitely go back and stay here again.

Springs on the surface all but poking through and the noisiest box springs I've ever heard. Every time I flipped or flopped to try to pretzel myself around the sticking out springs I would wake myself up with the box spring noises. I could hear every time my friend rolled over in the other room due to his box spring noises. Just awful, really, and all we wanted to do was sleep well after being on the golf courses every day for a week. I complained on check out and was told that there is a new management company that will be replacing all of the beds in two weeks time, (if true that's early Feb, 2012).

Yes the mattresses need changed but that seems common in many Orlando holiday outlets. The annoying fees are fairly common now in many places but are clear hen booking. They do however make it bad value for one or two nights but good for long stay. However daily fee includes free calls and Internet. Annoyingly free wifi is only by pool and reception. So it's a spacious, clean and well looked after place in a location that is safe and near to the main parks, with ample parking.

The two bedrooms were spacious and clean. The washer and dryer came in very handy. There were plenty of toilet (4 rolls) and paper towel (2 rolls) to last our stay. The kitchen was fully equipped. We had to bring our own cleaning supply, detergent/dryer sheet, hair dryer and shampoo/conditioner. You do need to take out your own trash and recycling stuff to the bins on the ground level. We found one recycling bin located near the elevator while trash bins are more abundant around. The check in and check out procedures were rather painless and the receptionist was very helpful. Just be sure you know about all the mandatory fees in addition to the negotiated rate - $5.95 DVD rental per day, $65 cleaning for the duration of the stay, no matter how many days, and $200 deposit that would be refunded at checkout. The reason for the two stars instead of the 4 or 5 stars others gave is because the beds in our unit were terrible. I don't mean they were old, I mean they were horrible. You could feel the spring just by touching them lightly. There was absolutely no cushion on top and all of them sink to the bottom if you sit on them. Even the Salvation Army would not want something like this. When our kids tossed around at night in the other room, we thought there were strange creatures in the wild looming in our unit. We finally realized the noise was from their beds. We flipped all the beds, hoping the other side would be just a little more bearable. I had to pop three cushions from the sofa in the living room under the sheet of our king size bed in order for my husband to sleep. But since he could not turn or toss sleeping on those cushions, he was all stiff in the morning. With that kind of beds, naturally we did not have any good night of sleep and our vacation fell short of being pleasant. Whoever commented the beds were comfortable in this property must be fortunate enough to stay in a unit with good beds. All in all, if you don't mind the horrible beds, this is a good place to call home while vacationing in Orlando. If you do want to get a good night of sleep, I would not recommend it. When I was asked how my stay was during checkout, I said the beds were terrible. Apparently she had already heard that many times. I said I hope they would do something about them. She said management is aware of the issue and the beds will eventually be replaced. When it will happen is another story.

The floor was more comfortable than the pull out, and all the beds creaked and squeaked. The kitchen supplies were minimal (one SMALL baking sheet for a three bedroom condo). The scissors were broken and we had to ask for towels. The bathrooms were large and pretty clean (although, I don't understand why most places choose white).

VISA/MC deposit that is released once you check out. 3) When doing comparisons, keep in mind you have to pay for your own toilet paper, paper towels, dish detergent, dish washer liquid, etc. They start you off with supplies, but depending on how long you are there, you will need more. 4) Bring a wireless router and configure it at home. This way, your devices (ex. Laptops, Ipads, etc) are already configured to this router 5) Bring spices, such as salt, peper, etc in ziplock bags. Nothing worse than having to buy the whole bottle at the store OR the alternative: bland food! 6) Set expectations. Pool is small and closes at dusk. Other than that, there is nothing to do. If you have your day planned to be off site, or plan on relaxing at home in nice A/C, then you are good! 7) If you plan to visit a beach, go to Sand Key Beach in Clearwater. It is 1.5 hours away by car. You will pass through Clearwater beach....resist the urge to stay there because Sand Key is soooo less crowded and you can rent chairs and umbrella's. There is even a snack bar that sells pizza, drinks and ice cream. Bring quarters for the metered parking. See for yourself..Cocoa Beach is 2nd on the list for Shark Attacks! http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/sharks/statistics/gattack/mapfl.htm 8) Bring your own GPS from home. This saves some cash. 9) When going to Disney, etc...don't bring unnecessary credit cards, etc. I learned that the odds are high of people losing wallets on vacation. Our heads are in the clouds most of the time! 10) Starbucks 5 minute car drive away, near Walmart. 11) SHOP AT ROSS ---TRUST ME. If you like brand names, go to ROSS Dress for Less. I went to 3 of them and the prices are waaaaay better than the outlet malls. They have everything...almost like Winners, but apparently is not the same company. 12) Stay on Ground Floor. Nothing worse than having to go back and forth to load your van if you have alot of stuff to move back and forth. Also, i saw a lady waiting for the elevator that never came. They eventually fixed it, but I was quickly relieved that I didn't have to go through that. I was initially disappointed not getting the view, but realized that it was a blessing in disguise! Back on topic, the condo itself is amazing. The master bedroom is the entire length of the unit. HUGE! King BED, his and her closets, Bathroom is gigantic --shower, soaker tub, his and her sinks and an enclosed toilet (with door). Bathroom within the bathroom. Customer service is superior. A lady called me the next day asking how everything was. She said to call if I needed anything. Screened porches allowed me to relax outside while I had my coffee. No bugs, kept critters out. I read all the reviews about the beds before I came. I didn't think it was bad, but my son said that his was really bad. It turned out that it wasn't the mattress that was bothering him, rather then boxspring would squeak everytime he had a movement. Thus my 4 Star Rating for Sleep Quality.

Caribe Cove is a beautiful resort to stay in, with beautiful buildings, and I felt safe parking my car there. I'm sure the majority of the resort is quiet and peaceful at night. However, I was in building number 4 (I'm fairly certain that was the building number, anyway), which faces a large pond in the back. The pond has a sign outside facing the building, which cautioned guests about the presence of alligators. At first I was excited about such a lovely view, however this pond also had a large amount of frogs. The frogs made their happy way up to the building, , I suppose to avoid the overflow of water when it rained, and while they could not make it onto the screened-in porch, they clung onto the rafters, the outside of the screen, the frame--everywhere, and made loud noises (I assume they were mating calls) all evening and night. The walls were so thin, it sounded like they were in the room with you. My mother had to put earplugs in just to sleep at night. I had to buy Benadryl and put a pillow over my head to sleep. It would get so loud, when I'd be talking to someone on the phone while indoors, they would ask \"what's that noise?\" It was like this every single night I stayed there--I was there for five nights. The hotel has already replied once that no one has complained of frogs--this is likely because people assume the hotel is well aware of the presence of the frogs, and they know there's little that can be done, short of killing them, which would be inhumane. I didn't want them dead--I just didn't appreciate being given a room that didn't allow me a restful night's sleep. Before anyone responds with anything contradictory, I would ask them to stay in a room on the first floor of building number 4 for a night, with a porch overlooking the pond, especially a night during which it rains (it rained almost every night of my stay). Also, I think it's worth mentioning that there is a housekeeping fee and a deposit which are expected upon your check in--they're not included in your initial fee. These may all be for very good reasons, but they were not mentioned during my booking with Travelocity and these caught me off guard and lowered the amount of spending money I had available during my Disney World vacation which I'd scrimped and saved for for months. There is no housekeeping during your entire stay, just FYI. I did not personally find the beds very soft, or comfortable. I could feel the springs. The staff was courteous and polite, and took outbound mail for me, and even provided me an envelope for it free of charge. I would consider staying here again, as it did have some decent amenities at a reasonable price, but I would be very sure to request a building away from the pond, and suggest anyone else do the same.", "Date": "August 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Woodbridge, Virginia", "Title": "\u201clarge rooms but loud frogs\u201d", "Author": "jdmded", "ReviewID": "UR115867180", "Content": "The condo is large with a good design but updates are needed.

The room was spacious, basically a 2 bedroom apartment with dining and living room. Patio area was fully screened in to keep bugs out and had a ceiling fan. It had a full kitchen with double door refrigerator with water and ice dispenser, full size stove/oven, microwave oven, toaster, blender and coffee maker. There were a lot of plates, bowls, cups and glasses. Utensils were basic. There was a kids high chair and play pen that we did not use. The internet connection is hard wired and is located by the TV in the living room and was very difficult to find at first. The cable was extremely short and only allowed use about 2 feet from the TV. Next time I would bring a cheap wireless router, or a my own cable (at least 10 feet). Overall the cleanliness of the room was okay. Could use some improvement, but wasn't filthy by any means. Bathrooms were clean and there were plenty of towels for both the bath and pool. I did see a carpet cleaning company there daily servicing various units. Beds could definitely use an upgrade.

We were only given one package of soap for the dishwasher(one load) and none for the sink so bring some from home. There is a computer hookup in the TV cabinet and your unit may or may not have the cord to attach to the computer. There isn't a desk near by so we used the coffee table. No wify in the room. The lighting in the unit wasn't bright enought for reading and the bathroom lacked towel racks but the towels provided were nice. These are just minor complants because we did enjoy the resort. They had free movie rentals in the lobby which the kids really enjoyed. The pool and hot tub were great. The unit was beatiful, clean and well maintained. It was great having a kitchen, washer and dryer, 3 Tvs, 2 bathrooms and rooms for the kids.

It is beautiful! We stayed in the 3 bedroom and it was excellent. The fact that they charge a cleaning fee and a resort fee is reasonable and NOT a reason for this gorgeous place to get a lower rating. The cleaning fee is so that the next people who stay will get just what we did when we walked in. I beautiful, clean, place to stay for 8 days. Because there is no cleaning from staff while you are there and you are making a mess that someone should have to pay for it to be clean. They scrub the carpets and everything after each person. And not an inch of dust was to be found. So I had no problem spending what I did to have such a clean place to spend my vacation. It was just the two of us and the resort did give us enough toilet paper, paper towels and dish washing liquid to last us while we were there. We didn't have to buy any. We did however buy some laundry detergent to make use of the laundry room so that I could wash the clothes and towels and we could go home with clean laundry and I wouldn't be doing a weeks worth of clothes right after come back from vacation. The flat screen t.v.'s are a little on the small side BUT we didn't watch much t.v. the internet cable does come out of the tv in the living room so it is a little inconvenient if you want to surf the web in bed. Speaking of the beds the bed in the master was hard and loud when you move around. However I am used to a pillow top mattress so I am a little spoiled. but I do think if Caribe Cove wants to do any upgrades the mattresses would be a great idea!!! The things I was surprised they provided were hangers, towels, hair dryer, blender, dish washing liquid, trash bags, all kitchen needs, high chair, and packnplay. We didn't use the last 2 but we thought it was nice they provided it. If you need to print directions do so before leaving home. They make you buy a card for 15 minutes of internet access for like 4 dollars to use the computers in the lobby just so you can print something. Overall this resort is amazing and we are already planning our next vacation and we WILL be coming back to Caribe.", "Date": "June 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Worth, Texas", "Title": "\u201cLocation, Location, Location....\u201d", "Author": "gail--r", "ReviewID": "UR111318572", "Content": "While this was a very well maintained facility, I found the location to be far from all of our family activities and I spent a great deal of time commuting.

Note: Weather was high 80s and humid. Traveled with husband and 2.5 year old child. From MCO airport, we crossed 2 toll bridges and at the time, we paid $1.75 - one was $1 and the other was $0.75 - have exact change. Hotel Location: Within 20 minutes of a drive to Disney and about 40 minutes to SeaWorld. Didn't go to Universal Studios so can't say about the distance to/from hotel. From MCO airport, you actually pass by Disney. You travel along Irlo Bronson and before the hotel you pass by SuperTarget, Publix, Olive Garden and other restaurants, banks and shops. There is a security guard on site but you're free to go in/out during the day, the gate is closed from 10pm onwards and you just show your Key Room to the guard. Resort is located off Irlo Bronson and is somewhat near a residential area; construction is being done across the street and we were woken up to a loud sound (more below). Overall the area was clean, not sketchy and we felt very safe and appreciated that we were within minutes to shopping, food and banking. Hotel Room: Stayed on the ground floor, thought it'd be a problem but being 4.5 months pregnant I liked just walking straight to my door. We stayed in Building 1 and unfortunately our screened-in balcony faced the lot and somewhat of the garbage bins. (Note: Not totally sure if the loud noise was the construction or from the bins.) Even with the humidity, there was no smell coming from there so we enjoyed many meals outside. We got the 2 bedroom Suite and it really would suit up to 6 since there is fold-out sofa in the living room. There is plenty of space so you really wouldn't feel cramped with maximum capactiy. The pictures they have online is exactly what we got so no surprises. They do provide starter kits - couple of toilet rolls, dishwasher soap, a sponge but YOU have to buy your own stuff to last your stay. They do have a little store in the Office and the prices weren't overly inflated compared to Target. King bed in Master was hard for me, we have a pillow-top mattress at home and this was hard. I had a hard time sleeping. 2nd bedroom had 2 twin beds, no one stayed there so can't comment on that. But the 2nd room had a massive closet, honestly you could get one other person to camp out there. There was ensuite laundry, full-size kitchen and proper plates/cutlery/cups in the cupboards. Depending on what you are cooking, they pretty much had the basics but don't expect every type of cookware. You get wired Internet and it was only accessible in the living room. At least it was free so no complaints. Master bed had access to small screened balcony but I don't recall any chairs so I guess it's for fresh air. Master bath had a nice soaker tub and room-for-2 shower. Everything was clean. 2nd bathroom had a standard tub/shower combo. There is no desk but you do get a 6-person dining table but again, Internet access for us was in the living room where the TV was so we did any work on the coffee table. Temperature control was fine and we had no problems. We really liked being able to open up the balcony and let in fresh air without bugs getting in. Hotel Cleanliness: The place is carpeted except the bathrooms and kitchen. Looking at the carpet you can see the vacuum marks so I guess they do clean it after all but I'm not there to watch them clean it so I can't say how clean it truly is. Overall, the carpet never felt sticky and we all sat on the floor or went around the room without getting bug bites or dirty feet. So, we were fine with the cleanliness. They also provide a vacuum, broom, mop and bucket if you need to do your own cleaning. There is a $65 Housekeeping Fee which I believe pays for the 'deep cleaning' of the room. This is mandatory and charged at the hotel. Hotel Amenities: There was a 'warm' pool. I didn't think it was hot at all and when the sun goes down, parts of the pool is in the shade. It does overlook a little lake and wasn't busy when we went. There was small hot tub but never went in due to pregnancy and our young child. Resort provides a DVD card where you can rent from the Office movies, in your suite the living room has a DVD player. This is included in the resort fee. Again, there is also a little store where you can buy cleaning products, chips, drinks, etc. I didn't see a restaurant onsite so I don't think there is Room Service. Buildings 1 and 2 are the closest to the pool and gate. There are elevators but never had to use them. There are no corridors so you have exterior doors. This normally detracts us from staying at a place but the security and the location of the Resort was no problem for us. Free parking was an added bonus. Check-in was pretty painless so no issues there. There is a small Fitness Room and at the Office, you can access the Sauna. Never used those amenities so no comment there. In addition to the Housekeeping Fee ($65), you do have to pay the $5.95 Resort Fee and a $200 Deposit, payable at the Resort. Calls are not included, even local calls so beware of using the phone. Cons: -We never knew where to put our rubbish or recycling. I would recommend better signage for guests. My husband finally found it when he explored our building but it was too late and we chucked everything in the garbage. -No WIFI and if you're sharing the suite with other people, you have to take turns with the Internet cable. -Firm mattress -Questionable public transportation. We did see bus service along Irlo Bronso so it may be possible to use buses. But along the route to Disney, I didn't see bus shelters so be warned that you may have to stand in the open heat waiting for a bus. Overall: We were there for Disney and SeaWorld so the location was excellent and we always felt safe. The close distance to other services was handy especially when packing for the next day's adventure. We did pass a Premium Outlet which I heard is open most days till 11pm, but I think that was near SeaWorld but we never tried. I would highly recommend this place to families.", "Date": "May 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Stay - Huge, Luxurious Rooms, Close to Disney!!!!\u201d", "Author": "holliwd", "ReviewID": "UR110010379", "Content": "Pros: This resort was fantastic. The rooms were huge! If space is what you desire, this is your place. The prices were also very reasonable. The resort is very close to Disney, and about a 20 minute drive to Universal. The location was fantastic. It was down the street from a super Target and a large chain grocery store. Liquor stores and dozens of great dining options are all very close by. The kitchen was huge with a full size refrigerator, stove, oven, and microwave. A toaster, blender, and all kitchen utensils were in place for use. The hotel was very clean. 3 rooms had their own separate entrances to a fully screened in deck with furniture. It was very nice. I can't say enough great things. Cons: As a word of caution, you should know there is a $65 cleaning fee, $5.95/day resort fee, and a $200 (refundable) security deposit; none of which you are made aware of until check in. Fortunately, I had read the reviews and was not surprised. Had I been unaware, this would have left a bad taste. This is more like a time share than a hotel. As such, there is no daily cleaning service. However, there is an adequate supply of towels and extra linen as well as a full size washer and dryer. In addition, a vacuum and broom are stowed in the laundry room. This was a non-issue. Considerations: It helped when I read in the reviews that toilet paper, paper towels, shampoo, lotion were not supplied. I knew to buy it upon arrival. I found an initial stock in the room, but it is not replinished. It too was a non-issue since I was already aware. The beds are not the most comfortable. Overall, this place was fantastic! I travel a good bit and typically stay in 4 star or higher. I was not disappointed. I would stay here again and again.

I thought that was a very reasonable fee to pay. When i got there i was promptly greeted by somebody at the front desk, after a painless few minutes, we had our room key. We stayed in a 3 bedroom suite, and were highly impressed by the condo. My wife & I both commented that we would be happy to live in a condo like this.

They also give you a card for a kiosk of free DVD's - which was great. Caribe Cove is off a very heavily traveleled highway but is nice and quiet. Good area for families -- near a publix supermarket for groceries, super target, cracker barrel for a quick lunch/dinner and some fun cheap t-shirt/gift shops - we like the one with the giant wizard out front! Such silly fun! There are about five huge \"villa\" buildings -- all within walking distance of the outdoor pool and clubhouse - we were in building 3 worked out just fine. There is a nice outdoor screened porch on each unit to sit outside - we had our breakfast out there every day and it was a really nice perk. Oh and there is a great soaking bathtub in each unit as well. Not jacuzzi however. Now to the beds at Caribe Cove -- miserable! - hard as a rock, crazy squeeky -- we were at this resort for four nights and never got a good nights sleep -- even after a long day at the parks. If you're reading this Caribe Cove folks - lose the mattresses!! Lastly, we had several folks rolling in to the resort late at night (3/4am) really loud and a few of them fighting with each other. However, we spoke to management and security and never heard another peep after night two of our stay. If you run into that problem see the manager at the clubhouse.

Really, these condos are very large and quiet. We heard the people above us walk around one night but that's it. The clubhouse also has a large pool, hot tub, sauna and steamroom. A new feature is the free dvd machine in the lobby which are current so my children could see some new movies. If I had any complaints-which really I don't but just some suggestions. I wish there was a bar/cafe by the pool and better coffee. The coffee in the lobby is free but it is absolutely awful.

It was meticulously clean (our carpets were slightly damp from being steam cleaned). Staff was great, we had a problem with our internet cable and someone was there immediately to fix it. Other than that, we had no problems, so no need to call the front desk or maintenance. It was so nice to buy food and be able to eat breakfast and supper here, plus pack a lunch to save money in the parks. We arrived back between 6 and 9 every night, and a couple of nights, the pool had already closed, which would have been nice. We were able to access it a couple of nights though until after 9 p.m., and a couple of other guests were also in it. It is unsupervised, and I think they just kind of leave it open some nights, and close it other nights. The pool was warm, and we swam in it even when the temp was in the 60's. It was smaller than at other hotels, but it wasn't busy and we enjoyed that. The pool area was well maintained. Just know before you go that you will have to buy a couple of things for your place, like toilet paper, dish soap, etc. We didn't mind this at all, as it saved us hundreds in eating out, which we would have had to do had we chosen a hotel room. The cleaning and resort fee we knew about ahead of time, but we had only paid around $700 for the 9 day stay, so when we added that it, it was still very reasonable. We loved it, and would definitely stay there again. Cleanliness and comfort are our top priorities, and this place has both. 2 things about Caribe Cove are that you definitely need to rent a vehicle if you stay here and plan to tour around (which we would have done wherever we stayed), and that the beds and bedding could have been a bit more comfortable (but we still slept well as we were all exhausted from our days in Orlando!)

It had a full size fridge, stove and dishwasher, and a full size laundry room with a washer and dryer. The grounds were beautiful and well kept. It is a little out of the way of the main hustle and bustle of the main strip, but that was perfect for us. Yes you do need a car if you stay there. The front desk staff was very polite and helpful. When we booked our vacation we were told there is a ONE TIME fee of $65.00 (NOT $120.00) for housekeeping and a $5.95 dollar a day resort fee ( which all hotel resorts charge in the US).

This resort is not a 5 * hotel, so if you want room service for your meals, or want maid service daily, well stay at the Ritz, you won't find it here. What you will find is all the luxuries of home and your privacy! The resort does help you with park tickets, but do require 24 hours notice. I would like to comment on \"Dibaash\" comment, there was no reason for dirty dishes, you had a full size dishwasher in your condo, as well, I have stayed at many hotels in my days, including several 5* hotels, and not one of them has done my laundry.. So your comment about \"dirty clothes\" does not apply, you had a washer and dryer to do your laundry! Yes you will have to stock up on bathroom tissue and paper towel, but the resort does have some when you check in,. you do however have to supplier your own when you run out,, Publix or walmart or the resort gift shop does have some to purchase for $1.00 a roll.

This is not a hotel - if you want someone to pick up after you, go to a hotel. We loved our stay. We checked in around 6pm on a Saturday night and Ahalya treated us like gold. She was helpful, answered all our questions and gave us tips to help us get around. She was super and we couldn't have asked for better service. I do have to address the cleaning charge. First of all, yes, it is a bit excessive but let's face it, they have to clean the room whether you stayed 3 hours, 1 day or 10 days (we spent 8)!! I want a clean room when I check in and obviously this is how they maintain things. The room was SPOTLESS and believe me, I am picky! And, FYI, Expedia clearly states ALL the extra charges on their website. There were 4 adults in the 3 bdrm condo and we had plenty of extra space. The only downside is that the mattresses were pretty old and creaky and should really be updated. Having a balcony that was completely screened in was such a bonus! We spent a ton of time sitting out there, enjoying the bug-free atmosphere. We overlooked a small lagoon which was really awesome (Building 4, Unit 501). We saw tons of birds, a gator, and even a bobcat early one morning. Awesome. The resort is a little further away than most, but if you love the chance to get away from everything, it is great.

We travel a lot with our kids and prefer a condo because of the space. Caribe Cove's units are huge and very comfortable for a family of 4. Other than that, we were not impressed. When we first got to our unit we noticed a few issues. The curtain rod in the master was tilted and pulling out of the wall. ,the carpet was worn and a lot of marks on the walls. We then contacted the front desk so that we wouldnt be blamed. Then as we unpacked we noticed several other problems. The only outlet in the master bath didnt work, the counter top in the kitchen was coming up in several places and the headboard on the master was pulling out of the wall (they are hung on the wall). Then when my daughter took a shower in the 2nd bathroom the tub was filling up with water. We then contacted the front desk and was told that the maintenance man was on break and he would come over when he got back. We waited over an hour and nobody. When then called back to the front desk and was told he was still on break. We waited another 15 minutes and nothing so we called and said we were ready for bed and would call back the next day after we got back from the parks. When we got back the next day we called the desk and was told that they would send him over. Over an hour later nobody. So, we called back and he arrived about 15 minutes later. He came with NO tools or anything to fix the drain. All he needed was a screwdriver to unclog the drain. We showed him all the problems and he told us that he didnt have the tools to fix the drain or the outlet and that he would send over the head guy while we were gone at the parks the next day to fix everything. He also said that they knew of the issues with the headboards but they wont fix it. So, at this point we have spent half of our trip with only 1 shower and 1 outlet between 2 bathrooms. Well, nobody showed up the next day. My husband finally had to show up at the desk the following day (we didnt get back until real late the day before) and stress our issues before the head guy went to our unit. My husband showed him everything that was wrong and the head guy said that this unit should of never been rented out because of all the problems. He also said that housekeeping was not doing their job because all of these issues should of been reported. The manager never called us, we were never asked if we wanted to be moved..NOTHING!!! In the end out of 6 nights the only thing fixed was the drain. We had 3 girls getting ready in 1 bathroom because the other outlet was never fixed. We were told they were sending over an electrician (never showed). Oh, the dishwasher didnt work very well either. We started it one day before we left in the morning and it never ran a full cycle. It would work every other cycle. When we checked out my husband stressed our issues and that nobody ever came back to fix anything and the manager on duty only said sorry. We called the property manager twice now and havent heard back from them yet. It seems like a very nice property when you drive up but its a disquise. They do very little to keep it up and dont care at all if there are any issues. I am sure our unit was rented out again without fixing one issue.

But, we're certainly glad that we finally did - my husband and I stayed in a 3-BR, deluxe suite (because of a nice price break at this time of the year); it was SO roomy that we almost found ourselves at first \"getting lost\" in the suite! WOW! They're big! Our suite could have easily accomodated 6 adults, with room to spare. The resort has been open 3 years now, and, it IS beginning to show its age already (especially with the carpets - off white; WHY do hotels always seem to prefer to use such LIGHT carpets?? - and the fading of overwashed furniture slip covers, and a few of the table lamps didn't function at all), but, overall, I think you'd be hard pressed to find a cleaner, nicer, or just plain BETTER resort in Kissimmee, for the price, with everything included (full kitchen, great appliances, huge fridge/icemaker, dishwasher, dishes, utensils, pots, pans, cookware, etc., just bring your own food! There is a Publix AND a Walmart close by. And - if you tire of eating in the condo - there is just about EVERY fast-food or chain restaurant known to man on Highway 192, and they're ALL only a few miles away), located at such a close distance to the Disney Parks. The beds are all very comfortable, there are flat-screen TV's in the bedrooms/living room, there's a full dining area with service for 8, two lanai/balconies, and the garden TUB in the master BR is great for soaking and long, relaxing bubble baths! We especially enjoyed kicking back each night on our huge, furnished balcony with a glass of champagne to watch the fireworks at The Magic Kingdom and Epcot (we were staying in building 5, room 503, but all of the higher floors - either 4 or 5 - with rooms facing EAST have decent firework views). The main drawback of Caribe Cove is that there is only ONE pool at the clubhouse (entrance to the complex), so you may have to walk some distance to get there, and it's not as BIG as it seems in the photos, so it stays very busy throughout the day. Also, we're not sure if there is a shuttle service to the Disney Parks (there is one at Bahama Bay, but it's fairly pricey, and doesn't run often enough), so we'd recommend having your own vehicle, especially with families. And, some people might be put-off by the fact that it is basically a \"self-concierge\" facility, you take care of your own light housekeeping during your stay, even though everyone is required to pay a final \"cleaning fee\" of $65 plus tax/esort fee, which ends up being $93 (and a $200 security/damage deposit, which will be refunded when you leave). My husband and I actually PREFER this, though, as that allows us our privacy, we like to cook, and, since a full-size washer and dryer is provided in each condo, dirty towels are not a problem (there are plenty provided throughout the condo as well, even larger towels for the pool). Overall, we feel that Caribe Cove would be an IDEAL location for a family, or groups, to stay, and, we highly recommend it; it's almost a \"home-away-from-home\", with a very friendly helpful, onsite staff, too.

A friend recommened we stay at Caribe Cove Resort. On his recommendation we booked our stay with them. For about the same price as a standard hotel room, this is what we got. We were on the first level in building four. The view from ourt patio was incredible! Woods in the background with a small pond in front of the wooded area. Nearly every night, we sat out in our screened-in patio and saw birds and small animals like raccoons and opossums drinking from the pond. We found it relaxing to return after a long day of doing tourist things like Disney and Universal. Our unit was spacious (1600 sq ft) and quiet. It had a full kitchen with cups, silverware, pots, pans, containers, etc.(Cooking breakfast and packing a lunch saved us a small fortune on eating out) Each unit also has a diswasher and washer/dryer, wired internet connection and cable tv with HBO. The carpets did have some stains, but overall, the place was clean. The grounds were also beautiful! The staff does a wonderful job maintaining everything. Every day we saw crews enter vacant units to clean carpets, power wash patio screens or paint before the new guests arrived. Everything looked as nice as the photos on their website. The clubhouse for the resort is located at the front entrance. It has a workout area with equipment, a small store to buy things like toiletries, cards, soda, icecream bars, etc. and an area with computers for guest use. They sell stamps and mail letters for guests and even set out complimentary cookies and coffee. Guests can get free movies from the clubhouse to watch in their unit. There is not a huge selection like at a video store, but there are plenty to choose from and many of the titles are current releases. There is an outdoor pool just behind the clubhouse. There is also a steamroom, sauna and locker rooms for guests. Caribe Cove Resort is in a great location. It's only about a fifteen minute drive to Disney...a little further to Seaworld or Universal. There is a Super Target and a Super Walmart within 3 miles. There are also several restuarants nearby. However, it is far enough away from the above mentioned things to still be quiet and somewhat secluded. Just so there are no surprises, Caribe Cove charges additional fees beside the cost of the unit. There is a cleaning fee of $65.00 and a $5.95 per day service charge for internet, phone and workout equipment usage. This is charged up front when you book in. All units are smoke free. If you choose to smoke in your unit they will charge you an additional $200.00 to get rid of smoke smell. (You are permitted to smoke on the patios.) Check in was at 4:00 pm/ check out at 10:am. Each unit comes with one of standard things like tissue, tp, soap. After that, you must supply your own. We just picked up what we needed at Walmart. They also don't have maid service, so if you mess it up, you clean it. The only thing that we were disappointed with was that the mattresses were not very comfortable. They really need to be replaced with higher quality ones. Aside from that, we loved our stay here and would highly recommend it to anyone. I think it would be difficult to find such a nice place for a similar price. We can't wait to get back!

Full size kitchen with all the full size coforts of home. The master suite was bigger than most hotel rooms with a door opening to a screened in balcony. It was not in a busy noisy part of town but had easy access to plenty of dining and retail as well as grocery stores. The pool was great along with hot tub, steam room and sauna. Easy access to the disney parks 10 mins i would say. A little longer to universal. But wasy access to I-4 for Busch Gardens fans. We will surly stay here again.

I will try to be as thorough as possible of my entire experience at Caribe as I just left from there yesterday. The staff were very friendly. I was expecting after hearing the negative reviews that I would be checked in by some person that would have a \"I don't give a rats rear end that you chose to spend your vacation with us\" attitude. However, the girl (did not get her name) that checked us in was as friendly as can be. She spent time explaining things and even answered our questions. I was always greeted by the staff whenever I entered the building. I saw smiles every time I walked in there, so I have no clue what the complainers were talking about. There were normally one to two employees at the desk. I did see them answering the phones, so I am not sure what people were saying that the front desk does not answer their phones. My only guess is probably they can only do one or two calls at a time. If more than 2 guests call then they cannot pick up. Just a guess. I stayed in building 5 room 303. I came to learn that the descriptions \"few\" people gave in their negative reviews concerning the rooms were not accurate. The room was very clean and it had a fresh smell when I walked in. The one complaint claimed that their security deposit ($200) was not refunded because they were accused of smoking in their room. I can say that it will be quite obvious that you smoked in the room because they do smell very fresh. The guests probably were not smokers but had either a cigar or a friend over that smoked. You will know in these rooms whether someone smoked or not. There were also plenty of towels that Caribe provided in the closets and on the towel racks. I had the impression that they did not supply towels for some reason but there were at least 12 or more towels in our room. Many of the complaints involving the beds not being comfortable are partially true. If you have a foam mattress at home or have some top notch bed then you might be disappointed with their mattress. If you are used to bed springs or simply have a mediocre bed at home then you will be just fine. I have a bad back and was able to fall asleep quick. Their bed springs were not stiff at all. You literally will sink nearly to the bottom. It actually felt good to me when dozing off. I did have an occasional pain but flipping on my side from time to time solved that. I did discover some problems that I reported to front desk. I told the lady that my one patio doors would not open. I informed her that the lights outside would not turn on. The one outlet in the bathroom also did not work. She was very polite and wrote the info down and told me that she would inform maintenance. It took about an hour or so before maintenance came knocking at my door. Turns out that the patio door lock was not broken but that the door itself was off its track as that took him 15 seconds to fix. The outside lights was easily fixed as he simply pressed the reset button on the outlet. I would never have thought of that since nothing was plugged into the outlets. The outlet in the bathroom had the Test/Reset button that were stuck. He was unable to get the reset button to press in, so he gave me an option of him running out to get a new outlet or have someone come back in the morning. It wasn't important to me. The maintenance guy was very polite from beginning to end. Yes, I did find some spots on the carpet. I could also tell that Caribe did what they could to have them removed. If you are expecting Caribe to replace carpet every 3 months then you might be disappointed. I think some people were being a tad bit anal on this one. If you go looking for problems then you will find it. If you go looking for any speck of dust then I bet you will find it. However, I realized that carpet used over and over again will get spots on them. The rooms smelled and looked clean. If it smelled like Coppertone and sweaty socks then I would be complaining too but it didn't. The rooms were all very large. Huge closet spaces in each room. Extra blankets if you are somehow cold in Florida. Absolutely loved it. I had to learn how to use the DVD player. Usually I have to hit some input button or hit menu to access the DVD player on other TVS. If you go there then you might have to figure it out as well. In my room, I had to click the up arrow button to go one channel more than 99 to get the DVD to appear on screen. Caribe obviously cares about it grounds keeping. I 'constantly' was seeing men working to keep the grounds looking good. Every day I had seen maintenance cleaning, painting and so on. Even the elevator we used was cleaned daily by a friendly guy that would greet us with a hello and a smile. They do have free DVD rentals that you can check out. They are not a Blockbuster video company so ignore the complaints that someone gave. If you think you will find 1000+ movies then you will be disappointed. My guess is that they have around 15 to 20 movies per category (Kids, Thriller, Sci-Fi, Action, etc). The movies were more recent and not the black and white garbage or movies from the 70's. The pool wasn't huge but was nice to relax by. It never was overly crowed when I was there either. I read a negative review that Caribe does not supply pool towels. First, don't be a lazy a** and bring the freaking towel from your room and stop complaining. Second, when I checked out on Thursday (17th) at 10am, I asked Gloria if my family and I could hang out around the pool since we were no longer guests of the resort. Our flight wasn't until 3:50pm and didn't feel like sitting at the airport or driving around all morning with a rental car. Gloria was as friendly as can be as I rarely meet people as nice as she was. She said that we could stay and use the pool and even offered us pool towels. Pool towels are available, but you have to ask for it. We brought towels from home believing that Caribe did not supply towels from certain negative reviews when they supplied more than enough. Laundry detergent is not supplied in the rooms. I don't know why some believe that Caribe Cove is to supply your detergent for your soiled clothes. Target is just over 2 miles down the road on 192 on the right hand side. Buy your food and laundry supplies there. Tide detergent is also sold across from the front desk at Caribe Cove. Caribe Cove supplies one roll paper towels, and one role of toilet paper per bathroom. I read some negative reviews where they seem to expect Caribe to wipe their backside for them. Having such an attitude will spoil the vacation. I almost let the negative reviews convince me that Caribe Cove might be a problem place before arriving. Caribe Cove certainly proved them wrong. I wonder if these same complainers whine to their rental car provider for not supplying gas to their car that they use up during their driving around. As for your $200.00 security deposit. I again listened to those negative reviews here that claimed that Caribe Cove would not release their hold on the money. Caribe Cove releases the hold upon check out. However, Gloria made it very clear that YOUR bank might take a few days before lifting that hold. Don't assume Caribe is holding your money. You just might have to wait 3 days or so before your bank releases the money. It's just like waiting for a check to clear. People here were so quick to blame Caribe Cove. Don't listen to those goofs as they can seriously affect your overall experience there. The air conditioning works exceptionally. My wife and I practically had icicles hanging from our noses as it got quite cold in there. Someone before us must have set the air to below 60 degrees. Our room was 66 degrees when we arrived. It did feel good though walking in from the heat. The air conditioning unit was outside between the two patios. I was surprised at how large it was. I live in a home much bigger than the resort, but my air conditioning unit is smaller that what they use. You will not have to worry about the air not being cool enough in these rooms. Yes, there was a guard on duty at night. He was very polite to us as we had to check in around 11:30pm one night. Some complained that he was not on duty when they showed up. I have to assume that night guards have to go potty just like any other human being. However, a gate is still down so don't assume that some stranger can just drive in when the guard is not present. They did have a box that appears that you have to swipe your room card to get in if the guard is not present. I guess some complainers just prefer a grand entrance from a security guard as they feel their money demands it. The fact that some would complain about that tells me that they are goofs no matter where they go on vacation. Room 303 did have a wonderful view of trees and a pond. Some complained that they had a parking lot view, or a view of a dumpster. I have to say that people are not loitering around the parking lots there. The patios are screened in entirely to keep bugs out. The dark screen they use will not make you as noticeable sitting outside. It was so hot outside that I doubt anyone would want to spend their days in the lot staring at you eating up in your balcony. The dumpsters that I saw were simply a large green garbage can with a lid on it that was kept by the side walk. It wasn't like a huge dumpster that you could see everyone's mess exposed with bees and flies in it having their meal. We just have some people coming here looking to exaggerate their bitterness with life is my guess. The pool was a bit of a walk in the heat. I would simply drive the 15 seconds over to the pool instead. It was no big deal so don't let people make you think that the pool is just so far away that it is not worth going. The workout room is closed in by glass windows. The workout room was closed during my visit. I saw fans, so I assume possible water damage was the reason (not sure so don't quote me). I never really saw anyone hanging out in the lobby area so if you do not like being watched while exercising then I do not see it being a problem there. Here are my recommendations for having a good time at Caribe: 1. Pack an extra roll or two of toilet paper from home to bring with. 2. Bring 2 large garbage bags from home in your suit case. We brought 30 gallon bags. 3. Find a bottle with a screw top lid and pour enough detergent in it that you believe will be sufficient to wash all your clothes when there. You can also purchase some when you arrive. 4. They supply you one small dish washing package for the dishwasher. Either go to target and buy paper plates, paper cups, plastic silverware, and so on to keep from using the dishwasher, or pack a little dishwasher detergent to run the dishwasher more than once if needed. I was able to get away with one single wash. All you need to bring is a zip-lock sandwich bag full of cascade. Cheap problem solved!! 5. If the beds hurt your back too much because you were accustomed to a nice bed at home then buy a $25.00 king size air mattress at Target. It will deflate and fit nicely in your suitcase when done. I personally believe that the mattress was just fine. 6. I don't know if you are like me, but Caribe Cove was very quiet at night. I need noise to sleep. Pack a noisy fan if you are like me. 7. Bring your GPS to find places. Caribe Cove was nicely located to practically everything. 8. DO EXPECT a cleaning charge around $107.00 (includes other things as well) and a $200.00 hold on your credit card UPON Check-In. If you do not know this then I can see how it might strike a nerve with some. However, you can't complain for your ill planning. I knew these things before I arrived. Expect to pay upon check-in. 9. This one does not relate to Caribe Cove. If you get a rental car then do NOT pay for their insurance as it is a scam. Your car insurance will cover it to begin with. Thrifty really went out of their way to try and scare us to get their expensive insurance. Don't fall for it. Just call your car insurance company before leaving if you want to make sure that your rental car would be covered. 10. Don't go looking for problems!! If you do encounter dust then you can either let it ruin your vacation, or you can take the 5 seconds it takes to wipe it away. You will find that the counters are clean. Do complain if you find shampoo residue, food stains, hairs in the drain, and so on that I am certain you will not find, but give us a break that you found some dust somewhere. Don't let the other negative reviewers spoil your vacation initially like it did mine in the beginning. I walked in my room the first day looking for trouble because of those goofs. However, it took about 2 days for me to realize that Caribe Cove was an awesome place that truly cared about me enjoying my stay there. My only complaint is that Florida in June was too damn hot!!!! I definitely will recommend Caribe Cove to my friends and anyone else that asks me where to room at. When I plan on returning to Florida then Caribe Cove will be where I am going to stay. I saw other resorts while there and they clearly do not keep up with their place like Caribe did. I was very happy. I just regret assuming the negative reviews to be a genuine possibility. At least it did not take me long to realize that these whiners were all full of crap.

So long as you know in advance, there's no 'suprise at the charge' and even adding that onto the room cost, it's still a great value resort. We wanted a place as a base and wasn't looking for an 'all singng, all dancing' resort with loads of facilities and it suited us. Having said that, there was a swimming pool, a small gym and a small shop (though it unfortunately didn't sell anything as useful as milk, it did have soft drinks).

Truly an apartment in every regard. Everything is quite new and in great condition. It even smelled new. The bottom line: this is definitely the place to stay for a Disney vacation. Here are a few things you should know. DISNEY COMMUTE: It took us about 30 minutes to drive, park, and enter every park. We travelled with a two-year old and returned to Caribe mid-day for a nap. This took a lot of time out of a highly priced day at Disney. If mid-day hotel naps are required, and you can afford it, stay at a Disney Resort hotel. KITCHEN: Having the kitchen was very nice and saved us an enormous amount on food. Keep in mind that this is not a gourmet kitchen. Plan meals that require only basic kitchen tools. IMPORTANT: Think of this as renting an apartment, not a hotel. There is no daily maid service. A washer an dryer is provided, but no laundry detergent. Only one load's-worth of dish washer detergent is provided and no dish soap. Toilet paper is provided, but only what comes on the holders when you check in. If you need more, you'll have to buy it. There is a Super Target and Publix about five minutes away. CUSTOMER SERVICE: Most of the complaints on Caribe Cove focused on the lack of customer service. Sometimes I think people are looking for something to complain about or tend to read into someone's tone as rude when there's no rudeness there at all. Take these complaints with a grain of salt. We found a broken coaster and DVD player when we checked in. Within an hour, maintenance had arrived and taken care of both items. The front desk attendant was very courteous and helpful. Mid-stay, we decided to extend it by one night, but wanted it at the discounted priced we were already paying. One visit to the front desk was all it took. She couldn't alter a reservation there (again, not a hotel), but within an hour, she had called our room and confirmed the extra night at the requested price. INTERNET: There is WIRED internet in the rooms and one 12-foot cable is provided. There are ports in the living area and bedrooms. There is no wi-fi in the rooms. There is wi-fi in the lobby. The lobby has two-computers and a printer, but you have to buy pre-paid cards to use them. BEDS: Bed quality is good. They are typical hotel mattresses; they are nothing too special. The sheets are pretty low quality, so bring your own if that is really important to you.

We had the 3 bedroom, it was large and all usable space. The location was close and convenient to everything we wanted to do. Every kind of restuarants you could want less than 2 miles up the road. When we checked in, we were given a room on the ground floor. I entered the room and everything in the room was not quite right. The lamp shades were not on the lamps as the bulbs were too large for the lamp shades; there were 3 large sliding glass doors out to the patio, although the doors were closed, the doors could not be locked at all(that is an uncomfortable feeling); all of the bulbs in the ceiling lights were of different brightness and watts. With the patio doors not able to lock, I packed up everyone and went back to the front desk. I told him of my issues with the room and told him to please select another room, the best one they have. He asked if I would prefer to have maintenance come to the room. I said absolutely not, I am on vacation, do your maintenance on your own time. I also mentioned that this resort charges a $65.00 cleaning charge, It did not seem to me that they are doing a good job at the cleaning and maintence for the amount of money they are charging. My next room, everthing was in order, I was very happy with the room. Of course until it was bed time. The best way to describe the mattress is cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap. Feels like a total of 6 to 8 springs in the entire mattress. The mattress will completely colapse when you move on it. The springs make a tremendouse amount of noise with any movement on the bed - \"ping, chung, kong, boing\" - you get the picture. We actually were all laughing, our stomachs hurt, the mattresses were so bad it was funny. But joking aside, I do not have any back problems, but after two nights sleeping on this mattress, my back hurt. Nor was I able to sleep, just tossed and turned all night. It was the mattress. And that is not funny. I did complain the morning of check-out to the front desk - I told them that I am sure that you have had complaints about your mattresses before, the girl smiled and said yes. I went on to state that for the prices that they are charging, they need to upgrade the mattresses. She smiled and said yes. I told her that I am 44 years old and in my entire life I have never slept on such a poor mattress. She again smiled, I think this time hoped that I would shut up and go away. I did. But not without thinking to myself that when I get home I am going to write a reveiw. By the way, I have never written a review before.

The previous resort rated poorly but turned out to be an above average place to stay. The Caribe, on the other hand, seemed to have an overall positive rating but turned out to be a poor choice. Although the location was relatively quiet with large sized accommodations and nice bathrooms, the negatives outweighed anything that was likable about the place. It began with the reservation process when the agent told us that we may be able to check-in early if we are in the area--a statement that was totally false. When we arrived at the check-in counter, the clerk kept putting us off and did NOT set a good standard for customer service agents. She told us that the room was being cleaned and to check back later, which turned out to be an untruth. When we finally received our room assignment, we could easily see that the rooms had not been cleaned anytime recently nor was any attention paid to detail. (This fact is a disturbing one because guests are required to pay a 65 dollar cleaning charge with each visit.) There was a layer of dust on several pieces of the furniture, makeup stains on articles in the bathroom and a dirty pan in the oven. Moreover, the beds were uncomfortable and there was a constant glare of fluorescent balcony lights that shines in one bedroom to the effect of full but unnatural daylight. Even with two layers of bed coverings over the window, the light still came through. The walls are also thin and the neighbors' televisions and toilets can be heard in the bedrooms. On some mornings, the water was only lukewarm when showering. There was only one packet of dish soap, which was a huge inconvenience because there was also a shortage of cooking pots and pans. The pool area closed way too early in the evenings. If they want to improve this place, they can begin by offering more thoughtful customer service agents. They should not pretend that early check-in is possible and certainly not employ rude agents at the check-in counter. They need to install light blocking shades, paint the walls, clean the rugs, replace the mattresses and springs, and stock this vacation place with adequate amounts of necessary items.

To start from the beginning, the resort is located off the 192 Irlo Bronsen Highway, right at the western end, just before you get to the 27. There's a big sign before the junction telling you it's next left at the lights. Half a mile down the side road and you find the main gate on the right. Unfortunately the road hasn't made it into satnav/gps yet, and the flag on the Tripadvisor Google Maps is way out, so just keep going west on the 192 - if you get to the 27 you've gone too far. Reception is in the resort club building, and the staff could not have been more helpful. They'll sort out any small problems, give advice on nearby shops and chat about the attractions. On to the condo - parking right outside the block, and a lift to all floors. Our three bed condo was vast! Serious danger of losing people inside. The condo was immaculately clean, housekeeping obviously having taken great care on presentation, so first impressions were good, just what you need after a long journey. The condo was very well equipped, ice making fridge, TVs in each bedroom and the lounge, more towels than we knew what to do with, and free internet access via an ethernet cable in the lounge (so only one laptop on line at a time - but you're meant to be on vacation, not in the office!), and a small welcome pack. Resort facilities include an infinity pool - I thought it looked a bit small on Google Earth for the number of units, but \"in the flesh\" it is fine. Hot tub, sauna and steam room available as well as a small fitness center, and complimentary coffee and cookies in the clubhouse as well as a very small shop. There is internet access there, but $4 for 15 minutes seems steep - I think they would get more takers at say $1. It does make it worth taking a laptop, if only to check on park opening times. Location: Great for Disney, probably less than 15 minutes (we didn't do Disney this time). Universal looks on the map to be completely on the other side of Orlando, but it is still only half an hour, with Seaworld slightly less. For those with an aviation interest, Fantasy of Flight is less than an hour away. Shopping: there's a Publix left and right on the 192, a Super Target right, and a Walmart just north on the 27. We were there at a quiet time (last week in October) but the units looked around 40-50% occupied, judging by the cars. It's actually a great time to visit, as there are no lines in the parks - my son took me on The Incredible Hulk about an hour before closing, and we walked straight on, same with Duelling Dragons. You will have read about the cleaning charge - but if you factor in the fantastic rate you are getting, it isn't so bad.

The first week we paid $89 a night. Since we liked the place so much I was going to cancel our other reservations for another resort and extend this place for another week. I thought first I would ask the front desk how much they would charge us. They said $109 a night. I asked if I booked the same way I did the first week if we could have the same condo and wave the second cleaning fee. They agreed so I went online to Expedia and booked for $77 a night after Expedia coupons. For the money we could not have gotten a better deal. The condo was huge and nicely decorated. Beds were fairly comfortable - 7 out of 10. Best parts of the condo: high ceilings which made the place look huge, huge bathrooms with huge showers, outside screened in lanai the length of the entire condo and we had a great view of the woods. The outside including the landscaping was very attractive and clean. The club house was nice but the exercise room was small. If you wanted to use weights they only have one machine with multiple stations. However, all stations are attached to the same weights so only one station could be used at a time. The pool and pool area was excellent. Huge salt water pool where one end of the pool had no top part of the wall and the water just flowed over. Huge steam room and sauna right offer the pool. Bathrooms off the pool area but watch out when you walk into the clubhouse. If the tiles are wet and/or you are dripping water the tiles are so smooth you might fall and really hurt yourself as I almost did several times. The only down side is that the pool is only open until dusk. I'll give you a tip however. There is only one person working the desk at night and if that person is kept busy they will not shutdown the pool until they get some time to do so. So use your imagination on how to keep them busy and extend the pool hours. If I had any complaints it would have to be that the carpeting looked like it was in need of steam cleaning and that there were some parts of the condo that was not clean very well. Also there was this lady named Gloria at the front desk that I believe just hated life. Not friendly at all and made you feel like you were a real pain to be standing there but I figured I would only have to put up with her a couple times. In fact most of the staff seemed pretty miserable. All in all we got a great price for a really nice place where it was pretty close to Disney World.

I would rate the time to Disney Parks as excellent. Overall, the location is a bit out on Irlo Bronson a few miles off the main strip, but there are restaurants and shops, stores very close. It does not have a resort feel, and I would not recommend it for someone who wants to walk out to a huge pool with slides and waterfalls.

Also, I have no idea why they put pebbled floors on the balcony. Hard on the bare feet. The resort was extremely quiet when we went, first week of May, which was nice after a day at Disney.

I am so happy we went there. We had a 2-bdrm, which was just perfect for the four of us (including 5 and 7 year olds). So much space to relax after the long days of walking. Our unit was very clean (big deal, so there is a little stain here and there on the carpet. They were freshly vaccumed). Also clean were the pool area, hallways and grounds in general. Screened-in porch was perfect. Ate breakfast there every morning, and some dinners. Great not to contend with bugs while eating a meal! Unit was well-stocked with everything we needed for a week of cooking. Plenty of bowls, plates, cutlery and cups. I simply brought some extra detergent from home for the dishwasher since I knew they only supplied one pack. Also brought extra TP, and a few other items I knew we would need that were not supplied (nor would I expect them to be supplied). Plenty of towels on hand for both the kitchen and bathrooms. It was so wonderful to have the washer and dryer too. I brought a couple of packs of laundry detergent as well so that I could freshen up our supply of clothes and towels mid-week. This was a huge help in being able to pack lighter. Brought our laptop, so the internet was a huge plus to keep on top of business goings-on at home. Pool was wonderful. Very, very warm and clean. Note that it is a salt-water pool for those that may prefer chlorinated. Plenty of lounge chairs. We never encountered too many people there, although I suppose if the resort was full to capacity, it could be overcrowded. This is a moderate sized resort, so I suppose the pool could be considered a bit small to accommodate full booking. I'm not likely to visit Florida during peak times though, so I doubt this would be an issue for me. Didn't use the sauna, steam room or fitness room, but all were easy to find at the clubhouse. I found the staff to all be very nice and accommodating. Contrary to the many comments to not bother trying to check in before 4:00 because they won't let you, I asked anyway and although they didn't have anything ready yet (this was around 11:00 am), they had me do all the paperwork and told me to come back around 2:30. We did and they gladly handed over our keys. We called maintenance to move the dvd player from the master bed to the living room, and they were at our door within minutes. Front desk called later to make sure everything was ok in the room. True, they are not full of suggestions when it comes to recommending restaurants or min-golf courses etc... but the choices are overwhelming to begin with and I didn't really find anyone we asked outside of the resort to be any more forthcoming with info. Fresh baked cookies available for the taking in the lobby were scrumptious! As for location, I am so glad I did not stay in the midst of the action. After 10 hours in the blazing sun everyday, and going through sensory overload, there was nothing better then to sit in the dark on the balcony (remember, screened in so no bugs) with a glass of wine and listen to nothing but crickets. It couldn't have been much more than 15 minutes to the parking booths at any of the Disney parks. No traffic issues at all, regardless of what time we came or left. I imagine going high season will result in heavy traffic, but figure the even greater congestion on the popular strips close to the parks such as I-Drive will make their drive much worse, even if they are closer. Everything you could possibly imagine is close by on 192. Super Target, Super Publix, Walgreens, all manner of restaurant, mini-golf, gift shops. All is at your doorstep, only a few minutes away by car (and you need a car anyway when you visit Orlando). I'd stay again in a heartbeat, and would recommend to anyone. This is a self-serve resort and if you actually do a bit of research on the place rather than just showing up site unknown, there would be no suprises with cleaning fee's and the fact that you need to supply some of your own supplies. Take into account the time of year you are visiting. Traffic is going to be bad regardless of where you stay if you go in high season. Be nice, be reasonable, and you'll likely get the same treatment back. I loved this resort, and look forward to coming back again some day. Only one minor complaint.

Our family had one side and shared a bathroom and my parents had their own side with their own bathroom. The hotel was stocked well with pans, wine glasses, pitcher, knives, silverware, serving spioons, storage containers for left overs, wine opener, toaster, blender, dishwasher, microwave, plates, bowls, mugs, glass glasses, dish towels, sponge. The closets were stocked with extra pillow, sheets and blankets. Both bathrooms had plenty of bathtowels, hand towels and washcloths. You should bring dish soap and extra dishwashing soap and laundry soap for the washer and dryer that is next to the kitchen. I brought extra garbage bags and paper towels and toilet paper. There was a high chair for the baby and a pack and play that were stored in the master closet. In the living room there was a t.v., dvd player and internet connection that we had to use a plug for and we set it up on the floor by the t.v. It was no big deal that it didn't reach to the couch. It was very nice not to have to pay extra for it. The condo was decorated in a tropical prints. It was very tasteful and nice. The rooms look exactly like they do on the Caribe Cove website. They even show you a floor plan. This was a surprisingly quiet room and we didn't see many people when we were there for spring break, although it was quite full, it didn't seem like it was crowded or that you were surrounded by crowds of people. We enjoyed the pool, steam room and sauna. It was very clean and not crowded at all. The lobby and fitness room was nice too. The had lockers and showers availble in the clubhouse next to the pool area. The clubhouse had computers availble for use with the internet and well as wireless internet. They had a small store that had chips, popcorn, snacks, soap, toliet paper, paper towels, sunscreen etc. We really enjoyed our trip and will stay here again. I booked our trip directly from the hotel site. I didn't want any hassles. The total for the 3 bedroom was $99 per night. (Split with my mom was $50 ea.) Unbelieveable for the price. There was a $65 cleaning charge added to the room and well as $200 security deposit. There is no maid service daily. I didn't miss that at all. The only thing I would bring next time is a heavy duty pan for cooking bacon in the morning. The pans were not what I am used to so I had problems burning bacon. But I totally understand why they would not have $50 fry pans here for people to use.

Pictures give an accurate indication of what you are getting so I won't describe in detail.

Service? Don't believe what's listed!\u201d", "Author": "Northeast_Mom_of_3", "ReviewID": "UR25709850", "Content": "We stayed at Caribe Cove last week and will NEVER go back. We found that many of the amenities listed on their site or our travel site either did not exist or were exagerated. Annoying but not necessarily a deal-breaker. What we coulld not tolerate was the complete lack of integrity by the front desk manager (Tamaria) and maintenance manager (Carlos). We had maintenance issues go unresolved for the duration of our stay, leaving one bathroom virutally unuseable. When we complained about the maintenance issues, we were told they had been fixed, when it was obviously not the case. When we told our travel-booking site about the discrepancies between the services and amenities offered vs those stated on the website, Carlos lied to to the website people calling to verify. When we complained to the front desk manager about the situation, she told us we needed to pack our bags and get off the property!! She even ordered a front-desk employee to call the police when I threatened to leave a bad review of the property on the website!!! Bottom line: HOUSEKEEPING- is non-existant throughout your stay. Need clean towels or sheets? You need to go to the store, buy detergent, andwash & dry them yourself. Some sites list mid-stay housekeeping as an alternative, but when we tried to arrange it, we were told it was not possible. SECURITY - is also non-existant. There is a guard station and gate at the entrance to the property, but it is completely unmanned and the gate is always open. Carlos insists that the station is manned after 10pm, but we entered the property after this time on 4 different nights & it was unmanned each time. I did not observe security cameras or security personnel anywhere on the property at any time throughout our stay. FITNESS CENTER/SPA SERVICES - are laughable. The \"fitness center\" is smaller than my bathroom. It is located inside the lobby, separated only by a glass wall. It has 3-4 cardio machines & a TV. We did not observe any steam or sauna, as are listed available on several travel sites. And the pool is substantially smaller than it is made to appear in photos on the websites. BUSINESS CENTER - The term is laughable. The front desk has a printer, copier, and fax machine for its own use. These are behind the desk, not where a guest can use them on their own and forget about privacy. You have to wait for a desk person to be free and then hope they're in a good enough mood that they will make your copies or send your fax for you. Not exactly \"business\" oriented. INTERNET - Wireless is only available in the lobby. Inside the unit there is 1 connection - behind the TV in the living area. The cord provided is not long enough to reach the dining table, coffee table, or bedroom. So, if you bring a laptop, you pretty much have to sit on the floor like a 6 yr old. The connection is VERY slow, borderline dial-up. Most of my pages crashed before loading. FLATSCREEN TV's/DVDs - The living area has a 25\" tube TV. Carlos insists that it is a \"flatscreen\" because the screen is not concave. It's not LCD or Plasma if that's your interpretation. Two bedrooms have very tiny (12\"?) TVs & 1 has a DVD player - but not the one in the living room. There are VERY FEW channels of regular TV available at this resort - it may be \"cable\" but there's not much more than the local networks, Disney & Weather. TOMMY BAHAMA DECOR - The units ARE large & they are decorated nicely, but it's really low-quality. As we were eating dinner one night, my toddler leaned on one side of the dining table. The leg on the opposite side fell out and bashed me in the shin causing a huge bruise. My usually laid-back husband nearly went through the roof when the manager threatened to charge us for it. As if our 27-pound toddler has the strength or body mass to break a table leg! LACK OF STAFF - Already talked about having no security or housekeeping people. We also never observed anyone working outdoors on the property. Late one evening we were approached by another (male) guest when we pulled into the parking lot. He had also just returned & found a 2-yr-old girl wandering alone in front of his building. For propriety's sake, he did not want to approach her alone, so my husband followed him back to his building while I brought our kids upstairs & called the front desk. It was a full 20 minutes before the front desk guy showed up to investigate and he NEVER called the police or any emergency services!! I was absolutely appalled! ARCHITECTURAL ODDITIES - There are some things about the units that are just wierd. Each bedroom has a vent in the wall into the main living area, so you can't get any bedroom completely dark or quiet as long as anyone is in the main living area (front hall, laundry closet, kitchenette, eating area, living area). Also, one bedroom is located alongside the exterior corridor leading to the unit. This corridor has a very bright light directly outside this bedroom window, which makes it impossible to get the room completely dark at night & leaves 1 person trying to sleep directly next to this window. There are also no blackout curtains in the units as claimed on some websites. I would never stay at this place again. I would discourage anyone I know from staying there. There are so many properties in the Orlando area that you can do a lot better for the same price elsewhere.", "Date": "March 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sudbury, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cDon't back down on your upgrade\u201d", "Author": "hollybop", "ReviewID": "UR25629886", "Content": "We booked a 2 bedroom with free upgrade to a 3 bedroom through bookit. We took our 3 children, two of whom are adults, and I really didn't want anyone to have to sleep in the living room. In fact, I would have booked a 3 bedroom if it hadn't already been free. When we arrived my husband checked in and was given a two bedroom. It was lovely but not what we booked. I had read on tripadvisor about some of the problems that people had had with this very issue. A few days before we left I sent an e-mail to Caribe Cove in order to confirm the 3 bdrm upgrade. They sent me a reply saying that I should have no problems. I think that that's what saved me. I basically had to stage a sit in with my computer in hand and the e-mail exchange loaded. The poor women on the front desk. Be friendly, these people probably make minimum wage and have to put up with stupid complaints all day (like the guys who were there complaining about the cable package on the TV - no ESPN I think). I was very nice to them but said I wanted to speak to a manager. I don't know where that person was but she/he was not on site to my knowledge and I never spoke to them. This was VERY stressful for me and probably for them. My husband was hugely uncomfortable. Eventually Gloria told me that they really didn't have any available for that night but they would be able to move us first thing in the morning (7 am.) I left with this assurance and a promise that we would not have to pay another cleaning fee for the next unit. I was not back in the unit for 5 minutes when the phone rang. Someone had miraculously just phoned and cancelled a 3 bedroom reservation for that night and they would be able to move us right away. I really don't know whether the fault lies with bookit or Caribe Cove but someone is not being honest.

You have to make your own bed and if you want clean sheets or towels during your stay you will have to wash them yourself. The washer and dryer both worked terrifically well and you can buy a small bottle - enough for several loads- of laundry detergent for $2 at the clubhouse. There is no salt, pepper, sugar or anything nor should you expect them. There were 2 rolls of toilet paper ($1/roll at the clubhouse), a box of tissues and two small bars of soap in each bathroom. In the kitchen there was 1 packet of dishwasher detergent, 1 packet of coffee, 1 roll of paper towel and not much else in terms of consumables. Extras are available for purchase in the clubhouse and the prices are not horrible. Really good coffee(regular and decaf) is always available in the clubhouse with \"to go\" cups but no real cream or milk. There is a Super Walmart close by where you can find ANYTHING that you need.

Don't even try. On the positive side we were able to use the pool and hot tub before check in and after check out as they have clean locker rooms right next to the pool that made this time enjoyable. A great alternative for us. 2 - Not a negative but a few tips: - remember this is more like a timeshare then a hotel, before you arrive bring with you some basics like extra garbage bags, toilette paper, paper towles etc. The best thing to do is get all your groceries before check in and get all the supplies you need as you clean and maintain your own unit during your stay.

We were in building 5, all the way in the back and on the 2nd floor. The villa was huge! It had a ton of space and places to put things. The kitchen was pretty well stocked. We did not encounter any problems with cleaniness that other reviewers had found. The place had obviously been cleaned and looked great. There were a ton of towels in the two bathrooms as well as extra pillows and blankets in all the closets. They had a pack ' n play in the closet as well as a high chair that came in handy. There was a large screen in porch that backed up to the woods and a pond. The one thing you have to remember about Caribe Cove is that it is not a standard hotel. They do not have housekeeping that comes in everyday. We have no problem with reusing towels and taking out our own trash. It's understandable with the price we paid. I would have liked to have some extra toilet paper, and some trash bags but that was about it. They do sell those up at the front store. It was very quiet. They did not have many amenties for children besides the pool but we knew that going in. The pool was very nice but nothing out of the ordinary.

A Mngr told me that it's in the contract small print. I was never shown. Next-If you go to Caribe Cove Resort it sounds romantic. Sit in the hot tub or a swim at sunset with your sweetheart. Romantic huh? Problem is pool,steam room, sauna and hot tob close at sunset or dusk. Strike 2. On to #3. Ever had a stool overflow and maintence take 2 1/2 days to repair it and clean up unsanitary mess. Well it happened. Then maintenance worker quipped off smart alec talk because he had tio be called in to fix it. The place could be nice but it was operated poorly. The service was bad. The Mngr. matter of fact (Tameria?) No safes on the property-don't bring anything of value. No alcoholic beverages to be bought on site,no bar by the pool etc. We travel alot and I wanted this to be a Romantic time with just my wife.

We had travelled a distance with lots of bags and they didn't have luggage carts to transport our things. When I asked about this, there was no offer from staff to help either. My husband made several trips up and down the elevator to bring our luggage in. The rugs needed cleaning and the unit was not that clean. We had no hot water on our first night of arrival. I called the front desk multiple times to ask for help and finally they answered after the 5th try. The maintenance man arrived shortly there after with a lollipop in his mouth which remained the entire time we spoke. Very unprofessional. There were no blankets on the bed, just a sheet and bedspread. When I found the blankets to put them on myself, they were filthy and stained. When I took my son out of the shower to wrap him in a towel, I discovered it covered in long strands of black hair!! The frying pan handle was falling off and the dishwasher broke a wineglass, which when told about it, the front desk indicated I would have to pay for it. There is no business centre so the front desk attendant, who seemed very cranky, had to check us in online for our flights the next day. She refused to allow me come behind the desk to see the seat assignments. So I had to crane my neck and body over the counter to catch a brief glimpse. We found this place to be very disappointing with unprofessional staff and out to make a quick buck. They've put the place together as cheaply as possible.

Our party included myself, my husband, our 1-year-old, my sister, and my father. We rented a 3-bedroom villa which was less than $100 per night, plus a $65 cleaning fee (standard). First, the pictures we found on Booking.com actually did a very good job of representing what we saw in person. This isn't always the case, so it was a nice surprise. The villa was quite spacious. All of the rooms were very large with extra-tall ceilings. The master bath was enormous, with a separate tub and tiled shower, expansive double vanity, and a toilet room. Every room had plenty of closet/dresser space. The kitchen was full sized, the dining room seated 6, and the living room was plenty comfortable. There is a screened-in patio with a table and 4 chairs, lovely for breakfast, and a laundry room with full-sized washer & dryer. The villa would have absolutely accommodated 6 adults or a large family comfortably, even for an extended stay. The kitchen was very well stocked. This wasn't the usual kitchen you find in a \"suite\" with a small saucepan, a beat-up frying pan, and two each of plates, cups, and spoons. There was a toaster, blender, coffee pot, punch bowl, serving dishes, and silverware and tableware galore. There were pots and pans and baking sheets and a cutting board... they even had a plastic pitcher for mixing up juice! Just a mile or two down 192 is a very nice Publix (grocery) where you can stock the fridge. The property is new and very well kept up. The front desk staff was consistently helpful and pleasant. We didn't use any of the clubhouse amenities, but things at least appeared to be clean and well-kept. Pricing was generally fair: we broke a glass and a bowl and the replacement costs were surprisingly low - a total of $3.27! On the other hand, they aren't as generous as some with the odds-and-ends: after you've used the first coffee pod/dishwasher detergent/etc you have to pay for replacements. There is a convenience store type shop in the clubhouse, which was nice at least. Even without advanced warning, the room was stocked for tots. One of the master bedroom closets had a portable crib and full-sized high chair ready for use. None of the usual waiting for 4 hours to get a crib. There were plenty of pillows and extra blankets, though the bedding was definitely of a low quality. Clean, but cheap. The bed was, shall we say, very firm. In that cheap spring mattress sort of way. The bedrooms all have vents through the wall directly into the main living area. Strange, and made it so you could hear just about anything between the rooms. Things you may want to watch out for: We weren't too happy with the check-in/out hours of 4pm and 10am. It seems this is not uncommon in the Orlando area, but still a bit of a pain. The $65 cleaning fee would be a bit of a nasty surprise if you weren't already aware of it. And finally, it's a bit out of the way - about 10-15 minutes to Disney and 20-30 minutes to the airport. (Though it's very quiet and pretty because of this.) Overall we were all very happy with our choice. For reference, we're Midwestern Americans and fit pretty snuggly in the middle-class slot.

The HUNT: This would be our 5th trip to Orlando, having stayed at the Animal Kingdom Lodge in 2002 and then off-site at the Caribe Royale Resort (no relation to Caribe Cove Resort) in 2003, 2004 and 2007) and assumed we would return to the Caribe Royale Resort (deluxe 2BR/2BA villa with full kitchen, and washer/dryer, almost 1250 square feet). However, I searched the Internet to see what other options were available. I first found a Marriott Residence Inn (our hotel of choice when we travel due to their accommodations for 6 with kitchen, free daily hot buffet breakfast and free afternoon snack/light dinner during the week and laundry facilities) in Lake Buena Vista which had rave reviews here and was only $169 per night (the Caribe Royale Resort was $239 per night), a savings of $70 per night over a 12 night stay which translated into $840! Add in the free daily hot breakfast buffet and afternoon snack/light dinner - I figured we would save about $1,000. The only potential drawback was that the Residence Inn was further away form the parks and didn\u2019t have in-room washer/dryer like the Caribe Royale Resort but, heck, I thought for $1,000 I could send our dirty laundry out daily and have it delivered and still save several hundred dollars (I wasn\u2019t serious about doing this of course but it made me feel good to find the Residence Inn option). So sorry, but it was goodbye to the Caribe Royale Resort - you were good for us in the past. However, being the compulsive vacation planner (and value-seeker) that I am, I continued to scour the Internet for other options and came upon the Caribe Cove Resort (CCR) (similar name, I know, but totally unrelated). The reviews on tripadvisor were generally positive, although I had a few concerns - no daily housekeeping (they charge a one-time $65 cleaning fee, no matter your length of stay), it was farther from the parks than the Caribe Royale Resort and the Residence Inn and was described as being in a rather remote, new and mostly undeveloped area, completely unknown to us. At least both Caribe Royal Resort and the Residence Inn were known commodities to our family. Hmm . . . quite the dilemma. The reviews did rave about the super size of the villas and that everything was so new and clean. CCR only opened in August, 2007 so the resort was virtually still brand new and would only be a year old when we would be there. Enough time for the resort to work out the \u201ckinks\u201d and be fully operational, right? Keeping fingers crossed . . . During May and June, the rates for CCR went from $149 for a 2BR/2BA or $169 for a 3BR/2BA to $99 for 2BR and $109 for 3BR and it was bye-bye to the Residence Inn. Aside from the savings and convenience of the daily breakfast with the Residence Inn and our prior good experience at other Residence Inns, the CCR was so new and much larger (the 3BR unit was nearly 1,600 square feet and included a third bedroom, which we have never had before). One of the reviews that I read about the CCR mentioned that they got a great price by booking their reservation for CCR through bookit.com, a website which I had never heard of or used before. After then reading reviews of this website, I checked out their rate for CCR, which had reduced rates at $109 for 2BR and $129 for 3BR. Could I justify the extra $240 for a third bedroom? That could buy a lot of Mickey ice cream bars and Dole Whips! I continued to check bookit.com daily just to see if the rates would go down (along with our economy and presumably the tourist industry in Florida) as we were getting closer to August and soon bookit.com was advertising a special for CCR - the same price for the 3BR as the 2BR. Looking better . . . a 3BR villa for only $109 a night! A couple of weeks later, bookit.com was offering the 3BR villa for an absolutely unbelievable rate of only $99 per night (while the price for the 2BR was still at $109 - still can\u2019t figure that one out)! I waited several days as my skepticism over both CC R and bookit.com kept me from jumping on this deal (you know, the old adage - if it\u2019s too good to be true . . . ). Finally, after calling bookit and CCR directly (although I am a huge fan of the Internet and do plenty of shopping and other business on-line I still like talking with the people I am dealing with), I was convinced that there were no gimmicks or hidden charges with either business and that it would be safe to make the reservation. After all, as I explained to my DH, if we hated it or they tried to add on additional fees, we would cancel through our credit card to get a full refund and move to the Residence Inn (they still had plenty of available rooms during our vacation period). We happily stayed at CCR and did not have to change hotels. So, with the mighty click clack at the keyboard, I made our 12 night reservation through bookit.com at the CCR for our deluxe 3BR/2BA 1,600 square foot villa for $99 per night (plus tax and the $65 cleaning fee) and said a silent prayer that I wasn\u2019t risking ruining our big annual family vacation in hopes of saving some money. (If you\u2019re keeping track, what should have been about $2,900 to stay at the Caribe Royale Resort was now drastically reduced to $1188 for our stay at the CCR, a real savings of over $1700!!) --------------------- Review of Caribe Cove: We absolutely loved staying here and had no problems whatsoever with the reservation, the price or with our villa! Everything was brand new, so spacious, quiet and a lovely place to come back to relax after a long and tiring day in the parks. Our villa (#1305) was ready (they are very strict that 4:00 PM is the earliest you can check in). There are 4 buildings to this resort and buildings 1 and 2 are the closest to the entrance and pool. We were in building 2 on the third floor. We unloaded as much as we could fit into the elevator and went up to our villa. We opened the door and were so pleased with what we saw. Indeed, everything in the villa was new and the place was HUGE! The boys staked out which bedrooms they were sharing (the bathroom between their bedrooms even had a separate bath tub and shower stall), tons of drawers to put their clothes away in. The kitchen was well-equipped and stocked and the washer and dryer in the laundry room were full-sized units, not those small stackable units. The master bedroom was so grand (it had 2 separate walk-in closets, which honestly you could have tucked away another person to sleep in - LOL!), whirlpool tub and a large square separate shower stall, double vanity sinks and a balcony. There was also a large wrap around screened-in balcony with ceiling fan from the living room (with 4 chairs and a table). There were 2 rocking chairs on our balcony. Every TV was a flat screen, too. We were pretty happy and I finally breathed a sigh of relief over choosing the CCR! Outdoor pool - small with no slide or anything but was clean and adequate for our purposes (there were always available loungers). Exercise room - small with maybe 4 or 5 pieces of equipment. We never saw anyone in there. You definitely need to rent a car if you stay here - there is nothing within walking distance. Overall, we were very pleased with our 2 week stay here and would definitely stay here again. However, Caribe Cove is not a resort as I think of a resort - there are NO amenities here at all (no on-site restaurant, spa or activities or anything else), which was fine for our purposes. We felt more like we were staying at a brand new home borrowed from a friend than staying at a hotel or a \"resort\". We literally had no contact with anyone from the hotel except for checking in and checking out - it was a little strange but we got used to it. Just to be safe, we videotaped the entire villa on the morning we checked out showing that all of the supplies (towels, kitchen utensils, etc.) were all there. I'm happy to report that we didn't hear from the hotel about any additional charges for missing items or excessive cleaning that we needed. If you have any questions or any hesitation about staying here, please send me a message. I have a lot of helpful hints to share if you decide to stay here but this is already too long!

If you have small children do not stay there there is nothing for them to do, no play ground no kiddie pool etc. The only thing I was happy about twas the price $123 taxes included per night for three rooms is not bad.", "Date": "August 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pietarsaari, Finland", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay\u201d", "Author": "finlady12", "ReviewID": "UR18595244", "Content": "We liked Caribe Cove Resort a lot!

The room was very clean and the resort is new. The room came with all the amenities you would find in your own home and then some. It was over 1500 sqft and all the rooms were a decent size. The bathrooms were just amazing with recessed lighting - definitely a romantic get-away can be possible even if the kids are along with the large master suite and bathroom with 2 closets hers/his and a sliding door to exit onto the nice screened in balcony. This property is very peaceful since it is about 10-15 minutes from disney off 192 and it doesn't offer much to do for the children, so you don't have a bunch of kids running around. So, if you are looking for that type of atomosphere, than you won't find it here. My husband was so impressed with the set-up of the room that he didn't want to leave to return home. This place is larger and nicer than some peoples homes. I am very particular and I fell in love as well. The space we had was enough room for 6 people to move around comfortably, although I believe it sleeps 8 if you utilize the sleeper sofa in the living area. There was also a DVD in the master to watch movies, so you can bring some family movies if you like. We actually plugged the DVD up to the TV in the living area and moved it back when we left.

A little out of the way of all the hustle and bustle of the big resorts but i liked that, (when i mean out of the way i mean 10 mins drive so its not a problem) We drove to citywalk universal for the nightlife most nights as there where lots of bars and clubs. I'd definately stay again and can't imagine staying in a standard hotel room ever again ! One good tip is book your car rental through www.hotwire.com first as we saved loads from pre booking from the UK with an american website, as car rental is a must . Also you get to use the facilities of Bahama Bay which is just round the corner which isn't really advertised when you get to the resort apart from on the carib cove website. Here they have a restaraunt, 2 pools, bars etc and a sandy artificial beachfront for sunbathing and a pontoon for spying crocodiles over the lake.

Family of four (kids 7&6) and had a 7 day disney pass(w/ waterpark). I can tell you that we'll definately recommend this place to any of our friends. Items you have to remember about this place (which I was expecting), there is no daily cleaning service, no room service and the front-desk was OK and polite for the 1 time I needed them. You will have to take your garbage to the bins in the parking lot, and there was no exceptional ammenities (wife said that the complimentary coffee was empty on a few occasions in the main lobby). That being said, the place is clean and huge...we had the 3-bedroom model with large screened-in balcony overlooking the woods. The kitchen was perfect as we enjoy our homecooked meals most of the time. There's a WalMart within 5 minutes with everything you need, yet the place is a remote and quiet new street...pool was clean and big enough for all guests to enjoy. The 3 bedrooms is a huge bonus, 3 TVs make life perfect after a long day of disney....eveyone can get their space after being on each others nerves all day ;) Hollywood studios is about 10 minutes away with no traffic, Disney is about 15 minutes.... Things that would have made the place perfect: 1> playground for the kids....can never get enough of those. 2> being able to BBQ would have been great! 3> basketball net would be a bonus. 4> Garbage pickup or easier to dispose of garbage on each floor (have to walk to the garbage down to the parkling lot). Some Advice, stay in building #2 to be close to the pool for walking. Turn off your A/C when you are on the balcony, the A/C is on the balcony so the noise disturbes your peace! Bring your notebook and make sure you know how to use it with an ethernet cable (cable provided), wireless doesn't work in the rooms, only in the lobby.

I will agree with other reviews about the grumpy lady at the front desk. I went to buy a few items in their mini-store and she was a bit put out that she had to stop what she was doing and wait on me. The man that checked us out was very polite. Only two negatives that I could see. #1........pool was only open from dawn 'til dusk. It would've been nice to have it open a little longer considering most people are at the parks until early evening. The pool is far enough away from the units that noise would not be a major factor. #2. The third bedroom with the twin beds definitely needs better window coverings. The window faces the hallyway and we had to put a spread over it to keep the brights lights from keeping the two girls awake. A bit tacky, but necessary.

Take Ocacola (?) parkway to 192 west. If you take 192 direct it will take over 40 minutes to get there with traffic and lights. The property is beautiful, quiet and relaxing. My few complaints are 1. the \"boys\" at the front desk are still learning what to do. 2. there is an automatic $200 hold on your card for incidentals. that is not mentioned any where. 3. though you are charged a $65 plus tax for cleaning, they do not clean every day. 4. they have wireless internet access, if you did not bring your lap top, there are no public computers on property. The rooms were large and the kitchen was well equipped for cooking. there is a wal-mart and publix not far for shopping and lots of places that deliver. the kids loved the pool and freshed baked cookies. the fact that there was a washer and dryer came in handy, but, you do need to buy your own soap.

Their website states they offer discount tickets to the theme parks. When I got there and asked to buy the tickets, the woman said we don't sell them here. I explained that I read on their website that they did. Her reply was, \"Did you not hear me the first time, do I need to say it again?\" We ended up getting them at the gate that morning with only 5 lost minutes.... 2. The same woman also told us that she could not print our Southwest boarding passes because the printer didn't always work, which was a bummer because I have 4 small children and wanted us all to be able to sit together on the plane ride home. My suggestions are If you stay there only deal with the young girl -she is so sweet and polite. At checkout when she asked how our stay was, I told her it was excellent. I said the only thing that could have been better was if their printer was more reliable to print out our boarding passes to make it easier at the airport.

Getting there: Print off a Google map before you go! This was my big mistake as the GPS does not have the location yet. If you have a GPS set the intersection to 192 W and Avalon, and when you arrive your destination, turn left at Westside sign, there is lights and a brand new bank on your left. We were really lost for an hour at 1 a.m. so we called the hotel and the really nice front desk clerk stayed on the phone with us giving us directions for 20 minutes until we arrived. Location: It is really close to Disney, but quite a ways from Universal and Seaworld and the airport (up to 40 minutes on a busy highway) so keep this in mind if you are spending time at Universal. Two Publix grocery stores on the main 192W out of the complex on the main highway, close to Walmart too! Rooms and property: AMAZING, one of the largest, cleanest places we have ever stayed. It is so quiet and someone is always cleaning the property. Our first night we were in a ground floor suite with a parking lot view, but easily moved rooms in the morning when we asked. The staff was friendly and helpful with this, and did not charge us 2 cleaning fees, which may have been an oversight as I offered to pay. Our second room was on the 5th floor, close to the pool, with sunset views over the forest (building 2). The pool itself was smaller than pictured it seems, but not very busy at all especially during the day. The TV remotes did not work in any of the rooms (to be fair, we never asked for batteries), but the internet did, you had to sign on every day using the room number on your phone. It is NOT WIRELESS as advertised, only by the pool. Also, this is a self-catering facility, so bring laundry and dishwashing soap, and anything else you do not want to buy. You get toilet paper, 1 set of garbage bags, 1 roll of paper towels, a couple of loads of dishwasher soap, and a few days of coffee. Towels are provided can easily wash in the in-room laundry (so convenient!) but no blowdryer, so make sure you bring one. In summary, we loved this property, but liked Universal Studios much more for theme parks, so might not stay again, because of the location, which is unfortunate, as we loved it, and it will be hard to top. As for the area in general, I have never met any friendlier people anywhere I have been. Everyone from the grocery store to the theme parks was so nice and helpful.
