Lucky it was a nice day and we could open up the windows and let it air out. After that it was tolerable. The location was close to bus stops and not far the the Fremont district.

Bad decision. We pulled in late, after 11. Parked, unloaded and went to bed. Room was very old looking but tidy enough. A strange smell which we never did identify punctuated our stay. I got up early, as i usually do, and went out for a walk to find a coffee and just scout around a bit. Wow. Across the street, almost like a bad movie; very run down motel, old white rag top Caddy in the lot with two other old Caddies parked as well. Two very obvious street walkers were out selling what their momma gave them and a guy came out of one of the rooms and yelled, and I quote\", Get your a#$ back in here right now B*&^h!\". This was 30 seconds into my walk. I was solicited twice in my short, unsuccessful walk to find a coffee, one for sex, the other a soft attempt to try and rob me. I walked back and booked the Space Needle Travellodge for almost the same price at 730 am; when I told them where I was, the lady said,\" OMG, get out of there, we will find you something immediately\".

We needed cheap place to stay but that wasn't going to be horribly scary which most motels on Aurora are. Most places charge by the hour. I had read some good reviews from posters on TA so I took a chance. The man who took our reservation, well, english was not his first language and he INSISTED that we check in first. I understand, it's Aurora Blvd. You want to see the people that are staying at your establishment. When we checked it another man (night manager) was there. He was super nice. The room was by the main office, that made me feel better but ... it is AURORA. The room was decent. The shower was a bit sketchy but after a night of dancing, I didn't really care, I needed a shower. If I see another show at the Nectar, I will definitely stay at the Marco Polo.

The difference from the other \"cheap\" motels is only a few dollars but they treat you like a guest, not afraid to leave your clothes etc. in room, nothing is missing from rooms such as garbage cans, toilet paper holders, door or window knobs/locks, and the towels are thicker than rags.

The rooms were clean. The decor was spare, as you'd expect for a stopover motel. Had no problems with any noise from any neighbors. Traffic noise was muffled as soon as the doors and windows were closed. The resident hotel manager was particularly helpful. We really liked him. The parking is easy. The buses into downtown and the Space Needle run right by the motel. You have to walk over a bridge and down about 4 blocks, but they're every 15 minutes. The only thing we actually noticed not up to snuff was that the towels were a little threadbare. All and all, this is great stopover value for a motel that is so close to downtown.
