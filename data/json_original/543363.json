In the basement of the hotel you can find a small spa with sauna, turkish bath and fitness room. You can also use the spa area at Tulip Hotel (some meters away from Pera Rose) which have sauna, turkish bath, a bigger fitness room, swimming pool and a whirlpool. They offer different massages (fair prices). The hotel is located in an area with lots of bars, restaurants and clubs. It's quite loud on weekends. So if you are sensitive, don't forget earplugs or stay awake and celebrate together with the people on the street. Now some minus points: At the check-in they told me they will block 1 night at the credit card as deposit but they blocked more than the total amount. A bit strange, I think. Internet was free but in need of improvement (sometimes not working or slow). Every day to every 2 days, I had problems with the key card system.

The staff was very kind and moved us to a higher floor and better room, but it was amazing because it still overlooked the back alley (thus over the nightclub) and we still wore earplugs to sleep! We're pretty laid back when we travel, but sleep is a must, so my recommendation is that if you stay there, MAKE SURE you do not get a room over the nightclub, especially if you have children.

After arriving at the front desk at 4:15AM after my delayed flight I was told that the room in which I would be staying for most of my trip (I was in Istanbul on business for a week) would not be ready until the next morning so I was put in a different room. I was told that the room to which I would be moved would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153much nicer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. At 8AM (after 3 hours sleep) the construction noise next door began. It was deafening and literally shook the walls of my room (drilling and jack-hammering). Obviously there was no concern from the staff that I would get almost no sleep that night. I went down to the front desk and told them that they must move me to a different room that was more quiet and that I was ready and re-packed since they had told me the night before that it would be available first thing in the morning. Needless to say it was not and they informed me that I would have to put my bag in storage. After re-packing to accommodate storage of my bag, I finally headed out for work that day completely exhausted. When I returned that evening I picked up my key and went up to my \u00e2\u20ac\u0153much nicer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room. It was horrible. (Either the staff has a very strange idea about what a better room might be or they just simply outright lied to me the night before.) Although it was on a floor that was a little further from the construction it was a room about half the size of my first room AND it had no window to the outside. The only window in the room looked out onto an internal air shaft in the building (no natural light at all). It was completely claustrophobic. I once again went down to the front desk and asked to be moved considering that I was staying for a week and was informed that it would be impossible. Defeated and with no other options I went back to my tomb (oh, I mean room) and began the process of unpacking and trying to find space for my things. After moving the bed over (so that I could accommodate opening the closet door) and having them take away the extra towels, blanket, etc I was finally able to make something work. Then I went to plug in my computer. Although the hotel has wireless (perhaps it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only plus) the room had only one outlet and it was next to the bed. I literally had no way to charge my computer. I would use it during the morning near the desk (where there was strangely no outlet) and then was unable to leave it out to charge during the day because the outlet was powered only when the key card was placed in it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slot\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand, of course, I had to take the key card with me. I could not plug it in at night because I would have had to put the computer on the bed and would have rolled over on it! So now I was settled in. And to think, why did I bother to bring my travel alarm? How thoughtful of the hotel to arrange for an 8AM construction call to wake me each day! I suppose that this hotel could be good for some people a couple of years from now when the construction is done. As long as you are traveling as more than one person and therefore will not have to stay in the tomb-style closet (I mean room) and require to plug nothing in then you will be fine. . .

An attractive multi purpose room off the foyer (Restaurant/Breakfast room/Bar) was also a little too dark; however I suppose they would call it atmospheric. The continental breakfast buffet was very good and included cold meats, yoghurts, bread, cereal, Hard-boiled eggs, sausage and occasionally scrambled egg. The wardrobe space and number of coat hangers was pretty limited. The lock on the hotel door had an alarm if it was not latched properly which sounds like a good idea. However, it was prone to going off too often. The bed was very comfortable. Many of the historic sites are reached via the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcVenicular\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (to Tunnel) which is a short walk from the hotel, then crossing the Galata Bridge by tram, which are modern and cheap. Taxi's are pretty good value too. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss the Topkapi Palace, Basilica Cistern and Hagia Sophia. The Bosphorus Ferry-cruise (six hours) is good too. Do avoid the Hotel's recommended Fish restaurant under the Galta Bridge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is of poor quality and very overpriced. Generally Istanbul food is very good value. The whole Hotel experience and location was not five star, arguable not four star either (in the conventional sense) but it was certainly very good for the money paid.", "Date": "November 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "cooltravelers40", "Title": "\u201cDark room and moldy shower!\u201d", "Author": "cooltravelers40", "ReviewID": "UR20051277", "Content": "Dark room and moldy shower.

The room was pretty standard but of a good size and had an amazing view (we were staying on the 7th floor overlooking the Bosphorus). The ONLY downside was that the Saturday night we stayed there was an outside terrace bar opposite the hotel which was booming out trance music until 3am. The windows were double glazed and even still it was like a stereo was playing in the room. We called reception who didn't seemed surprised by the music and said it would be finished by 2am. This could have been a one off night or could happen every Saturday. It certainly didn't spoil our stay.

Staff were friendly and very helpful, and with good English skills. My twin room was on the second floor, at at the back, which made it a bit noisy at weekends, but fine during the week. Friends on upper floors had less noise. Room size was adequate, but I was shown the rooms with a queen bed, without an external window, which seemed a little claustrophic. Bathroom was good, with hot shower, half bath, and great water pressure. Mini fridge in the room, and small LCD TV. Breakfasts were great. Large spread of options. Location was handy both for Taxim and the conference centre (7 Lira one way taxi trip, or 35 minute walk), and the old city, which was also easily walkable (or could walk to Galata and take the tram), but the hills on the return trip were a challenge! Area felt safe, even at night. Lots of bars, restaurants, and cafes within close proximity. Staff also took great care when my stay coincided with May Day marches to ensure that any difficulties or trouble was avoided, which was appreciated. They also came to the rescue of others in our traveling group whose accommodation booking was not honoured elsewhere.

I always take the view that if I like a hotel, then I will return there, and the Pera Rose is a hotel that I would stay in again. Great location! In a quiet street a couple of minutes walk to Istiklal Cadessi (Street). No outside noise could be heard at all! As a boutque hotel it's not the largest, but it is very nice. Reception area is very well mainted at all times and the staff are friendly. Restaurant is very nice and again, the staff there are extra helpful and friendly. I had a standard double room. Room size is ok, can easily accomodate 2 people and luggage. Flat screen TV on the wall (although some channels were not accessible). Bathroom was pretty small however though. Only room for 1 person at a time in there. there were some aging marks in the room; frayed carpet, crack in bathroom tiles, but nothing major. Free wireless Internet throughout your stay. I was on the 8th floor and I managed to pick up a decent signal in my room so you don't always have to use their Business Centre to check your emails etc... The health-spa was nice. Although I didn't get the chance to try any of the offerings available, it all looked very well maintained. The actual Fitness Suite leaves a little to be desired though. Only the two exercise machines there and some free-weights, so don't book this hotel on the basis of their fitness suite. Only real downside to this hotel is funnily enough the level of light. The room, restaurant and most other places seemed to be kind of dark and could do with a few extra lightblubs here and there. Only other gripe was that every time I left the hotel, sitting outside was a child trying to get me to give him money by weighing myself. It is Istanbul and this happens in many other places but it did become annoying every time I ventured near the hotel.", "Date": "March 17, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Pera Rose Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d543363-Reviews-Pera_Rose_Hotel-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$106 - $213*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Mesrutiyet Caddesi No 87 TepebasI</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Istanbul</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">34430</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Turkey</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "543363", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/f4/23/f423ee71490b2ff5a3ddaac219376f1c8large.jpg"}}
