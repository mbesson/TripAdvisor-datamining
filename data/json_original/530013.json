{"Reviews": [{"Content": "basic, friendly, clean, comfy bed. We booked a 4 night break and were looking for a basic cheap end accomodation. We felt it was very good for what it set itself up as and what we paid. It was very clean, really comfortable beds, spacious rooms up unending stairs it felt! The ensuite was tiny but adequate and the shower worked and gave hot water all day, All of these things have been much better here for us than staying in much more expensive hotels in the past. The ensuite flooded when you used the shower unless you put towels on the floor but that was not a problem to us. -Just gave them extra washing.The staff were friendly and helpful, pointing us to a local well priced restaurant that made proper tuscan food. Breakfast was quite basic and they have no idea how to heat water hot enough for tea which is a shame as they have decent teabags. They need a kettle! Bread and pastries were fresh and pleasant enough and a fair range of cake type stuff and small range of cheese and meat, fruit and juice etc. Coffee the best bet to drink.Mosquito's a big problem despite plug ins to help. Situation is great. Very close to the street market and 10 mins walk to station and Duoma.", "Date": "Oct 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR127513732", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "visitingmum"}, {"Content": "Cheap and chearful Stayed in the hotel ginori in June 2005 and got what I expected. The hotel is very centrally located, just a 5 minute walk from Il duomo. The accommodation is cheap and very basic. The airconditioning was not working but the room was cool. The room was clean except for one thing - squashed mosquitos on the walls. Worse than the squashed mosquitos on the walls however were the live ones flying around. Even though I had an electronic mosquito repeller, they were determined and it was impossible to keep them away.Hotel Ginori is really a pensione but has bathrooms ensuite which you don't usually get in a pensione. They don't take credit card payments either. Because of the tiled floors in the corridors, you will hear anybody who returns late and makes noise in the corridors. Breakfast is very basic - coffee machine, juice and some sort of tart. Dont stay here if you are used to luxuries, do stay here if you are on a budget and are prepared to rough it a bit.", "Date": "Aug 22, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR491012675", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Teallaire"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d530013-r21177901-Hotel_Ginori-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "530013", "Price": "$137"}}
