But i can understand that its a 3:rd part service on that, and of course.. there is a pay-option on that and you get faster internet and even mail-client service. The free wifi is only for browsing the net. the breakfast isn't anything to get excited about\u2026 dry bread, \"chemical orange juice\", no green as tomatoes or cucumber. dry cheese. very nice baguette although! The food on the restaurant is a disappointment. i ordered tagliatele carbonara. The pasta was kind of \"2 min in micro-sticky\" and the sauce was lumpy, like it had been defrosted to fast. but i can have wrong on that. But! i have taste aloooot of carbonaras around the world and this was actually the worst i have tasted. And about the communications with the staff. Ok, i can understand that people here aren't so great with english.. But i would like to see that the waiter could at least help us out what the fish dishes had for fish in them. One miss was when i booked the hotel on my hometown\u2026 its waaay off the city, we have to spend about 25 euro on taxi each day =) and the spa was very expensive. 13 euro for 90 minutes just to access the pools.

Finally my wife and I settled on this one. We wanted to be just outside the city centre, away from the non-stop noise of an urban environment. And this did the trick. And so it was, that we heaved our cases onto the Renfe train and then the Metro, up hill and down dale, until we finally arrived at the Senator. The hotel seemed to be totally surrounded by apartment blocks. But the entrance was very pleasant. We met one of the nicest and most professional receptionists, a chap called Jos\u00e9. We were far too early to check in, yet he handed over our keys anyway. The room was a very interesting 'L'-shape, which meant the built-in wardrobe was by the door, followed by the bathroom, and then the bedroom itself, through a connecting door. The whole arrangement gave the impression of a mini-apartment. Most satisfactory. The only downsides were the occasional 'drainy' smell - which occurred momentarily twice in our five-day stay - and the fact that the room was a touch on the dark side. Not 'dark' as in 'evil', I'd like to add! We had a kettle that refused to switch off, but Jos\u00e9 had that replaced with a new one straightaway. And he stressed there was a free mini-bar in the room, encouraging us to make full use of it. There was also a safe \u2013 and a shoe horn! We had paid for room only. Sometimes we ate at the hotel, sometimes we ate at other restaurants. The hotel's meals turned out to be competitively priced. I thought the seafood paella was a bit small. But another evening we ordered a starter and there was so much food, we ended up cancelling the rest of the meal and just headed straight for the bar! We got to know the bar staff, Taullant and Raul, who were among the warmest and friendliest blokes you could meet. Nothing was too much trouble for them. I would consider going back to this hotel just to chat with them again over a wine or a cocktail. At one point I had a problem with a nearby cash machine outside the hotel, so the concierge Davide came with me and guided me through it. The staff at this place are really quite excellent. The spa looked great, but this was an extra cost and we were watching our holiday budget. If we had stayed longer, we may have used the spa a couple of times. The rooftop pool is free and looks lovely, though it was shut for the autumn and winter season. However, we were in Barcelona for the culture \u2013 of which there is plenty. The Senator is a short walk from the Metro station, and we soon got used to the system. This hotel is a gateway to a whole treasure trove of Catalonian art and architecture, as well as being a short walk from FC Barcelona's ground, Camp Nou, and within easy reach of local banks, cafes and supermarkets.

It was close enough for us to take the subway to those areas. There weren't many restaurants nearby though. The hotel was big, very nice when you walk in. We checked in after midnight, get up to our room, only to find that the bathroom was dirty (towels used) and an open pepsi bottle in the room. The beds were made but obviously the room had been used by someone. So we went back down and requested another room. They gave us the handicapped room, which was huge, as usual. PROS: 1. The mini bar is free for all guests. Although, it only included pepsi, orange juice, water, and non-alcoholic beer. 2. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. The housekeeping was very generous with refilling our mini bar and giving us extra supplies (towels, toilet paper, sheets, toiletries, etc.) 3. The hotel's ambiance in the lobby was very nice with a restaurant, business center, lounge area... 4. The beds were extremely comfortable, with down comforters and fluffy pillows. 5. They had a lot of spa options, which on one of the days we were there, was 50% a few services. (massages mostly) 6. The hotel provided a decent sized safe in our room which we were able to use CONS: 1. Our new room was at the very back of the hotel, and on the 2nd floor (which happened to be street level). I did not feel safe at all when it came to the window in the bathroom. 2. I opened the covers to the bed, only to find a small bug crawling under the pillow. The beds were nice, the most comfortable we experienced in Spain, and even had the bed adjusting remotes (which I assume were b/c of the handicapped room?). I proceeded to sleep on the other side of the bed, where after our second night's stay, I found another small bug, a different type of bug, crawling in between the pillow and headboard. 3. The wifi only worked in the lobby. You cannot catch signal anywhere else, so it was inconvenient for us to have to go down to the lobby every time I wanted to check something on my iPhone or Nook... they also charge to use their computers in the business center which was not what we experienced at other hotels in Spain. 4. We paid for the spa b/c the pictures of it looked amazing, and we were very disappointed when we walked in.

Another minus is you can hear people in the hallway, especially if they are not being considerate and the door slamming was heard which was like a slap if one is trying to sleep on this uncomfy bed. House keeping was mediocre on of the examples; we had toilet paper upon arrival less than half, upon cleaning the room after the first day, she leaves us a roll which has less then the one already hanging.

Hotel - A stunning large reception area with a piano bar, bar restaurant, buffet restaurant, 3 lifts, internet room and spa. Rooms very spacious with recliner beds (brilliant for watching tv & reading), air con and fan, free mini-bar (we had 2 pepsi, 2 juice cartons, 2 bottles of water & 2 bottles of beer - Cruzcampo or low alcohol) restocked daily, lovely bathroom, the view wasn't overly impressive but can't complain with the area. Free WiFi too, just ask at reception for the codes. The rooftop lounge area and pool is lovely for a relax. Location - We normally go package holidays so did a fair bit of research on how to get from the airport to the hotel without having to be fleeced for a taxi ride! When you get out the airport, follow the signs for the Renfe train. Tip - When you get to the station, I would recommend buying a T-10 ticket from the machines on your right (these cost 7.85 euros and allow you to use the Renfe train, metro and buses in Zone 1 of Barcelona) and any of the trains at the station will take you to Barcelona Sants (3 stops away). Then get the L5 (blue) line on the metro towards to Collblanc then the hotel is around 10 min walk up the main road. The entire transport system in Barcelona is fantastic, so clean and efficient! This is a very residential area, which we quite liked, but neither of us able to speak much Spanish we did struggle at times, but the locals are very friendly! Most restaurants don't open until 9pm but something to get used to! A few little pastry cafes are dotted around the hotel which are perfect for breakfast! Camp Nou - A 10-15 minute walk down the road from the hotel, you can see the rooftop of the stadium from the road outside the hotel! We didn't go to a game, but I would definitely recommend the stadium tour! Tip - if you have a smart phone & Facebook account, use the hotel WiFi (or internet room if not) and check in at the Camp Nou (FC BARCELONA), I had to manually search it but it does pick it up! It has an offer for 2 for 1 at any Nou Camp experiences, just show the offer at the ticket booth and save 19 euros! Barcelona Centre - The metro stop Collblanc takes you straight to Segrada Familia (around 8 stops on the L5 line) and what a sight! We didn't do the tour bus, walked instead down to Las Ramblas then to sea front where we went to the aquarium and had lunch at a place called Gino's, which was amazing!

When we arrived at the room we discovered the only mistake of the week. We had booked a family room but there was only one double bed. When we returned to the reception the guy was apoligetic and it seemed the mistake was at the hands of the booking agent we booked through. A quick call to house keeping and another room was made up in ten minutes. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. There is a pillow list on the room so if you need to change for a particular type of pillow you can call reception. The aircon was great with good control settings on it.

The hotel is situated in the middle of huge high rise residental appartments.

There is a metro near by which takes you into Barcelona, but if you cant speak Spanish dont bother even trying to get directions to the station from the reception staff as the only map they have does not cover the area the hotel is in.

You should buy T-10 or even T-30, if you are going to stay for at least a couple of days. Camp Nou is 5 min walk, and there you can have a tour inside the stadium (which is really interesting), visit museum and official shop. The area did not seem neither quiet neither dangerous to me; I did not have any problems. There are a lot of excavations nearby --- they are building Metro Line 9, which will connect the area directly with the airport. When it is complete, this will be a big plus. The hotel is tightly surrounded by buildings (and has almost no of its own area); those building are even higher than the hotel itself, so there is no view from the roof, and the people from those houses can observe everything on the hotel roof and in the pool. The room was quite big and well-equipped. Free WiFi (and with a high speed!; WiFi is also available in halls, but with worse quality), free minibar with non-alcoholic drinks (see below also about it), CD and cassette player, TV with programs in half a dozen languages, ironing equipment and a big safe (my ~15\" notebook fitted without any problems), air-conditioning (you need to get used to it) and a fan at the ceiling. The conditioning turns off when you open the window, which is not very good. There are signs that I could ask for free bathrobes and a set of pillows, but I did not bother for it. The lighting system of the room is quite complicated: you need to insert your key-card into a special switch to enable any lights (which is convenient, as you simple take the card out on leaving and all the lights go off); but there is some complicated algorithm of operating all the switches to get the required lamp on. I did not manage to understand it, and kept on with try-and-look. The room was quiet, that is, I had no problems with sleeping. The hotel has a small swimming pool on the roof and a sunbathing area around. The pool is really small (about 10x5 meters; they could think on making it bigger, I'd say), but it is really relaxing when you get there after a day of walk (until you come across a group of 3 guys diving into this pool, which, in fact, can turn good too ;) ). The pool closes at 10pm, which is not really convenient, as you would probably like to spend evenings in center. You can have a buffet breakfast in the hotel. It costs 15 euro, which is quite expensive (you can have buffet lunch in center for 10-11 euro), but can prove convenient (not all restaurants open early on the morning). The buffet has a selection of bakery, selection of ham and cheese, some basic fruits, juices, yogurts, cereal, and you can order omlets for you, which I found really tasteful (and which is the main reason why I have taken the breakfast more then one time). There is also a spa center, which I did not use. The staff at the reception was really helpful: they at least spoke and understood good English and answered all my questions. However, the other staff (in particular, the restaurant staff) understands only a very basic English, which is a disadvantage. The minibar contains two small (0.5l) bottles of mineral water, two bottles (0.3l?) of pepsi or fanta etc., one non-alcoholic beer (0.3l?), and three juices (0.2l?). This is really useful, as you need water on long walking days in the city, and you can avoid buying it for big money there; and the is a really big advantage of the hotel. They usually replace it every day, but once they did not at all replace it, and several more times they replaced it partially. On the first occasion I called on the reception, and they immediately fixed it, on other times I did not bother, as I was alone and the replaced amount was enough for me; I was not able to drink it all anyway. However, this is a flaw, I think. So, to sum up, the hotel is very good with a lot of advantages (mini-bar, WiFi, swimming pool, ...), but has some minor flaws (problems with mini-bar, non-English-speaking staff, small pool and short pool hours, expensive breakfast, quite strange air-conditioning, tight surrounding with houses) which you should be ready for, and one big minus --- location. But it seems that all the similar hotels in the center are much more expensive, so this hotel is a good value for money. As some other reviewer has written here, if you can afford a similar hotel in the center, go there, otherwise this one is a good choice.", "Date": "July 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gibraltar", "Title": "\u201cExcellent!\u201d", "Author": "jmguzman10", "ReviewID": "UR31631999", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel for a weekend with my GF and we loved it.

Rooms - alittle on the small side for us ie 2 adult + 1 child but functional - adequate towels soaps etc. provided - mini bar free!! soft drinks + beer + tea + coffee facilities Room service we used twice + the second time we had to send food back as it was cold but this was sorted very quickly. Spa - I thought a little expensive it cost 15euro per adult + 7.50euro per child - but the children were only permitted to use it between 10am - 11.30 am which shortened your day for doing other things. Area - 5mins walk from CAMP NOU well worth a visit even if you are not into football but go early ie 10am as it gets very busy later on. Metro 5mins walk around the corner so very handy for transport to everywhere. Just to the right of collblanc metro station is a hiving area of bustling activity small markets + stalls + good at night. There are also a couple of good fruit shops + cafe bars close by and a hairdressers called EGO - which my mother attended for a cut + blow dry excellant work! Overall a nice stay, good location, nice area, easy access, taxi from airport 30euro.", "Date": "January 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucharest, Romania", "Title": "\u201cHad a nice stay here\u201d", "Author": "mkivu", "ReviewID": "UR12345170", "Content": "Very nice hotel.

Most of Barcelona's sights are not walking distance from the hotel but the metro is efficient and accessible so it really didn't effect our stay. The hotel concierge was extremely friendly and helpful. They made us dinner reservations and helped us with Flamenco dancing tickets. We called the front desk 15 minutes before we needed to leave for the airport and they called us a cab. The room was quiet and clean. Simple. Room service was on time but the pizza was made with an anchovy-like paste (yuck) and the burger was less than desirable. Stick to restaurants in and about the town! Aqua del Playa (hotel's jacuzzi/indoor pool) is not worth the money. We never ate at the hotel restaurant. There are too many great places in the city...in fact, many great restaurants are in walking distance. Our favorite-Lombardos-is just a few blocks away. We enjoyed Sangria at the hotel bar after long days of trekking around. I am neutral in my recommendation. If you can spend more money then stay at a hotel located in the heart of Barcelona. If this hotel is in your price range then it's a safe bet.

The hotel was a little way out of the centre, I wouldn't stay here if you want to be near the Ramblas etc, having said that it was only a 15 euro cab ride to the top of the ramblas and about 15 minutes on the metro to the Placa de Catalunya. It's very near Camp Nou stadium, and was ideally placed for the Palau de congress where our conference was held. We were very impressed with the hotel. The rooms were spacious and comfortable, good air conditioning, lots of little freebees like a mini bar stocked with fruit juice, beer, water and other soft drinks which was free. Nice tasteful decor and good sized bathroom. Also very quiet. We all slept very well. The food in the hotel was average in the bar, with omlettes and sandwiches etc, not a menu designed to blow you away but not too bad. Breakfast was amazing - a range of pastries, bread, cheeses, serrano ham, tuna, smoked salmon, fruit, even champagne. I don't know how you could have more for breakfast really. We didn't eat here for dinner. The bar staff were friendly and served fabulous cocktails. We didn't go in the spa because it seemed a little too formal, but we spent lots of time on the roof, where there is a lovely little rooftop pool and sun loungers, we really enjoyed being up there. There was no bar though which was a shame, but you could call down and get them to bring drinks up. We thought the service in the hotel was very good indeed, apart from the maids who did the rooms. They were clean enough, but they did things like not give you any loo roll so you had to call down and ask for one (no spares in the bathroom), and didn't restock the free mini bar one day (annoying when you want water) so that was a bit below what you would expect from a 4* hotel. Also, the white cushions on the sun loungers on the roof are so filthy they must be a health hazard and should be destroyed!! If anything needs a good wash, it's those. They coud make a lot more of the roof terrace to be honest, it needed attention but we still enjoyed it.

The hotel is literally a 5 minute jog from the stadium and is ideal if you are going to a game. The hotel does seem to have problems with its computers though, as on arrival we were told that they would have to transfer us for a night to another hotel. That said the staff could not have been more apologetic and were very helpful in resolving the issue. They organised a prepaid taxi to take us to the AC Barcelona ( a superior 4 star) and while we waited they provided us with complimentary food and drink. The staff were polite and attentive and certainly not as described. We were given the option of either staying at the AC Barcelona or returning to the Senator (at their cost) - which we did. The rooms, whilst not huge, are very well equipped and comfortable and have a complimentary minibar (softdrinks and beer). The piona bar is large and staff very friendly, although there is not a great atmosphere during the week but hey who is going to sit in the bar when downtown Barca is just a few stops away on the metro! The spa complex is as good as I've seen and worth every penny of the 15 euro it will cost you (but even better when its free on account of the booking hassle.) We stumbled across the restaurant by accident and if you can't find something you like on the buffet you must be a hugely fussy eater. There is every type of salad, cold meats, cheeses, shell fish etc and then the Chef will cook you chicken, fish, pork, pastas, crepes. This is all for under 20 eur a head which to my mind was great value. The location of the hotel is great for the Camp Nou but otherwise there is not much to do nearby. That said the Metro is 5 minutes walk away and with regular trains ( every couple of mins) you are no more than 10 minutes away from Ramblas, Passeig de Gracia, Sangrada. If you want to get a taxi back it will cost about 8 Eur.

We had tickets for a late season match, which, at the last minute, was scheduled for live TV broadcasting at 10pm. Luckily, the Senator is only a 10-15 minute walk from the Nou Camp stadium and so we would able to walk back home at around midnight on Saturday, instead of crushing into Metro trains or trying to find a cab. For reason of this convenience, I would stay at the Senator again - but not for any other reason. The hotel is clean and smart but the staff do not make guests feel wanted in any way (except for one very pleasant waiter). When we arrived, after a delayed Iberia flight, we waited ages at reception for the one receptionist on duty to finish dealing with another guest. It was still only around 9pm on a Friday evening, so why such meagre staffing? The receptionist told us that our booking had been cancelled by our tour operator (yes, really!!), and that, despite the fact that we had paid for our three-night stay in advance, she could find us rooms for one night only, as the hotel was going to be completely full on the next night...but they would try fo help us find another hotel! So much for choosing a hotel close to the football ground! I found it hard to sleep that night, worrying that I would have to spend the first day of our weekend in Barcelona searching for and moving to another hotel. Judging by the packed flight we had from London, Barcelona was going to be choc-full of tourists for the bank holiday weekend. There was no point in unpacking our cases, and the children kept asking where we were going to go. Anyway, to cut a long story short, after several calls the next morning to Air Miles (with whom I had booked the trip) to try to find out what had gone wrong with the booking, I went down to the reception desk mid-morning to see if the duty manager had an explanation for me, and, hopefully, a solution to my accommodation problem. Yes, he knew all about our problem, but it was all OK; it had been a 'computer error' - on whose part, I don't know - but we would be able to stay for the full three nights after all! It was obviously a great relief to hear that news, but why it hadn't occurred to him to pick up the phone, ring my hotel room, put me out of my misery, and save me a few quid in mobile call charges, I don't know! The Senator's staff shortages are not limited to the reception desk. The piano bar had no pianist and the bar could also do with more staff (the service is very slow). Learning how to smile at guests would do a lot to make them feel more welcome.
