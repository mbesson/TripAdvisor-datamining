The rooms were large, well-furnished and clean. The bathrooms were large as well. It's a very quite hotel. The location is outstanding with many restaurants nearby. The US Airways Center and Chase Field are only a few blocks away. The light rail stops right beside the hotel and it's a pretty quick trip to and from the airport. (I had to go back to the airport to pick up a rental car. We took a cab from the airport when we came in. I made it as quick on the light rail as the cab and it cost $1.75 as opposed to $30.) The hotel is very quiet and peaceful. The lobby is on the first floor and the next 10 are not part of the hotel. The meeting rooms and gym start on the 11th floor and the hotel rooms start on the 12th or 13th floor. The pool is pleasant (only 3 1/2 feet deep.) Our rooms had a small (empty) refrigerator which was convenient for us. I guess they all have them. Bottled water was free in the rooms as well as the gym. We didn't eat at the restaurant but it looked appealing. We did go to the bar and the service there was excellent. Parking is $27 a night but there is a nice, well-lit parking garage literally right across the street (between the Westin and the Hyatt) which charges $12 for a 24 hour period. The only complaints I have about the room (and they are very minor) is that the lighting is not good at night when looking for something in the closet and the alarm clock rather difficult to figure out. The staff is very friendly and helpful. This is an excellent hotel.

It is a great hotel, great views, great service, very clean and modern rooms and most of all a comfortable clean bed. We had a corner studio suite on the 17th or 18th floor. It was great, I love the glass from floor to ceiling. At $450/night it is a little pricey but much better than the other hotels I have stayed at downtown that are similarly priced. I don't know how anyone could not like this hotel. We had breakfast vouchers with our room, I didn't like what they were serving for the voucher breakfast so I orderd eggs benedict and low and behold they didn't charge us for it and accepted the voucher no questions asked.

It really felt like the hotel had been built or renovated recently. It was also nice that the hotel's business center and gym were open 24 hours. Room service was great too. Several things to note about this hotel. The hotel looks to be a part of a business building (I think the first 10 or so floors are business offices?). Also, not sure but this building may have been a complete office building before the top floors were converted to hotel rooms--each floor has a name that looks as if you are walking into a doctor's office. Also, one of the other downsides while I was visiting was that the pool had been rented out to a private party. Understandable that the hotel needs to make money, but it seems pretty presumptuous to close the pool on the weekend when that is one of the top amenities at the hotel. It wasn't a deal breaker for me, but I could see that a visiting family might be annoyed. Last but not least, the AC unit in the room does not seem to be adjustable. You can control the temperature range to a degree, but the unit appears to be permanently on. This was annoying if you didn't want the fan blowing on you all night.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brunswick, Maine", "Title": "\u201cGreat boutique style hotel!\u201d", "Author": "mainegirl759", "ReviewID": "UR126496396", "Content": "This hotel has some of the nicest guest rooms I have ever stayed in.

The people, however, make it terrific. Originally, I think the building was supposed to be part of an office building. However, due to the changing commercial real estate market, it was decided to make the floors 11-18 into hotel and meeting rooms (I think the first 10 floors are the parking garage). Floors above 18 are predominantly used by the tenant whose name is on the top of the building, Freeport-McMoran. What this means for the traveler is that the rooms are huge, even by most luxury hotel standards. Add in the fact that it is still relatively new and you've got a physical plant that is both unique, inviting and comfortable (e.g. the Heavenly Bed). Not all rooms have tubs, so if this is important, you might double check with the hotel. However, the bathroom appointments are neat, clean and modern. Internet connection is excellent. Without exception, everyone I have met at this hotel (I have stayed about half dozen times) is friendly and truly seems to want to help make your stay a pleasant one. If you are able to get upgraded to the Westin Club Lounge (not all Westins have this feature), I would highly recommend it. Both Athena and Shaina are terrific hosts, not only knowledgeable about the area and the hotel, but focused on making sure you are comfortable using the Lounge. One final tip: Downtown Phoenix is about a 15 minute drive to the airport, so you can also use this hotel as an 'airport hotel' for those late night arrivals/early morning departures (PHX has no hotel on the premises). One thing to look out for: The hotel is literally in the middle of downtown Phoenix, so you might want to time your arrival so that it does not conflict with rush hour.", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Richland, Washington", "Title": "\u201cComfortable and cool...\u201d", "Author": "acandkc", "ReviewID": "UR125768590", "Content": "Get a room on the 18th floor.....the rooms are huge, the views magnificent.

The rooms are very nice and really large with modern amenities (ipod docks for the alarm clock and TV) and contemporary decor. The heavenly bed was of course heavenly! I had a great view of the mountains surrounding the city from my room. I got room service the first night I was there and the gourmet sandwich and salad I got were delicious. The hotel is a short walk (about 10 min.) to the convention center and to the Arizona center which has several good restaurants and a Starbucks (not very good shopping though). I liked the short walk in the morning; however, if you're the type of person who likes to walk out the front door and have everything right there you might want to choose a different hotel. The location of the hotel was the only semi-negative for me. As I mentioned before, it is only a short walk, but you walk past a parking garage on one side and what looked like an empty run-down building on the other side on your way to the convention center & Arizona Center. I did see a couple of homeless people on that path, but this is a city, and they were not bothering anyone, so that didn't really bother me. During the day this was fine, but at night, as I was a women travelling alone and most of my colleagues stayed at one of the larger hotels directly across from the convention center, it did make me a little nervous to walk back to the hotel, but I just walked fast and stayed aware of my surroundings.

Turned out, we occupied one of 12 rooms that were booked that night.

Room is one of the largest I have seen at a Westin. Huge wardrobe in hallway entrance that houses hanging space, drawers and a mini bar that can be stocked to your liking or used for anything you bring. Large dresser with flat screen TV across from the bed. Large couch near window in addition to chair and ottoman next to the interior wall of the room. Also a nice desk/work space with a char on each side. Floor to ceiling windows compliment the great view west. Bathroom has a large shower stall, no tub, with both rain shower and hand held shower based on preference. One sink in large vanity and toiled area that is open to the rest. If you intend to share this room, a high level of in the bathroom should not be expected unless you close the main door to the room, which prevents someone from using any of it. Typical heavenly bed included. Room was absolutely spotless. Ordered room service for snacks and hotel was willing to add menu items from the independent restaurant on site. As a gesture for our anniversary, they brought us two small bottles of champagne, two ice cream bars, box of truffles and extra water and soft drinks at no charge. They forgot an item and retrieved it immediately with great apologies. Asked bellman about train schedule and they offered to arrange a town car for $14.

Yes, it is new and with that come lots of problems. The worst is the air conditioning vent., It blows all the time, and you CANNOT turn it off. That's for supposedly green reasons. How can that be? The thing blows in every room 24/7. That's insane. So you have generally cold air blowing on your face all night long. Not fun. and doesn't exactly make for restful sleep. The restaurant is horrible. The food is well below average and quite expensive. We had breakfast and it was barely edible. The pool deck is closed and not slated for opening for several more months. The stairwell is locked from the inside, so if you get in, you can't get out anywhere but the bottom floor but there's no notice of that. They try to not make up the room or bring you towels unless you specifically ask for clean towels. On the good side, the staff is polite and generally helpful. They try hard to rectify the myriad problems, but ultimately there's only so much they can do. the gym is well maintained and the free bottled water is a nice touch. I think what was most disappointing is that the hotel looks really nice but below the surface there lay hidden a lot of problems and they really interfere with a pleasant stay. Wish I could have been more positive.", "Date": "April 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel in good location\u201d", "Author": "a0002140", "ReviewID": "UR103771926", "Content": "The hotel just opened and I think that we were the first people in our room.

With Westin, you generally expect a certain consistency with the experience and this is certainly true at this Westin. The bed, linens and bathroom amenities were all of high quality. But this Westin is a little different in some ways. It seems smaller and boutique-ish as opposed to huge and convention-ish. I liked that very much. The room was large--about 600 sq feet and was decorated in the dark wood that has been popular for a while now. It accommodated 2 queen beds, a desk area and a couch. The bathroom was up to snuff. It was quiet. There were floor to ceiling windows with valley views. Overall, very nice. The bar was nice. The staff was friendly and made good cocktails. It is a nice place to sit and unwind. The restaurant has a nice menu, but we didn't try the food. The staff in the lobby was very courteous and friendly. I question whether there are enough potential guests to fill the increasing number of hotel rooms downtown, but this may fill a niche for a smaller upscale place for business travelers or locals attending an event downtown to stay.", "Date": "March 20, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Westin Phoenix Downtown", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g31310-d2015227-Reviews-Westin_Phoenix_Downtown-Phoenix_Arizona.html", "Price": "$158 - $305*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">333 North Central Avenue</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Phoenix</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">AZ</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">85004</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "2015227", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/e7/9d/4a/westin-phoenix-downtown.jpg"}}
