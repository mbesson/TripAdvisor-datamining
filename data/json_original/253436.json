It is excellent value. It's location is ideal for visiting the sites of Rome. We walked to all the major historical sites (all within pleasant 20 to 30 mins walk or less)...ie The Coliseum, Roman forum, Trevi fountain etc. It is also 10 mins walk from the Metro and about 15 mins from Termini station. It is also a great shopping area for clothes and shoes.To visit the Vatican city you can get the Metro .. 3 or 4 stops from metro station. There is a great snack bar just below the hotel serves great coffee and sandwiches etc. An excellent Italian restaurant just 3 mins walk from the hotel and a pizzeria just across the road all frequented by Italians ... which as they say if the locals eat there it must be ok! The staff are friendly and always very helpful. The room was clean, comfortable and practical. If I'm ever back in Rome this is where I will stay.

All of the correspondence with the hotel beforehand was excellent - any questions we had were answered promptly and excellent directions were given to find the hotel from Termini. The staff at the hotel were levely, and helpful throughout the stay. The rooms themselves are small and basic, but everything you need for a great stay is there. There is some noise from the road outside, but I wear earplugs, so it wasn't a problem for me!! The breakfast was good - cakes/pastries, toast, juice, yoghurt, cereal etc. Don't expect a full english! The hotel is in an excellent location for all of the main sights in Rome - it didn't take use more than 15 minutes to walk to anywhere (maybe 20 if you like to take a more relaxed walk). The only exception to this was the Vatican. We got the metro there on the morning (The metro station is less than 10 minutes away) and then we walked back in the afternoon taking in a number of other sights. I would also recommend eating at the Trattoria Antica Hostaria da Angelino which is also on TA... this is maybe 10 minutes away from the hotel, and the food is excellent. But if you want to eat here then I reccomend that you book beforehand. It was literally jam packed on the two nights we were there (one when we couldn't get a table, and one night we actually ate there).

Needless to say, I have recently returned from Rome (March 2012), and this is the second time my husband and I have stayed at the Hotel Giuliana, and this time we also had my in-laws. This hotel may be considered a budget accommodation. Trust me, this is not in the same league as the seedy Motel 6 chain in the US. It is conveniently located near all the major sights in central Rome by foot. The reason I stayed here again is because the staff is very friendly, warm, and extremely helpful. If you are traveling with an elderly person or have a lot of luggage, the building has an Old World European elevator that will take you to the first floor - where the reception desk and guest rooms are located. Our room was pleasant and clean. The breakfast was good and adequate - plenty of fuel to start your day of sightseeing. The rooms have satellite TV - if you care about that kind of thing. Public transport is close by and several restaurants from which to chose, if you want to eat your way through Rome. If you happen to be doing the Rome Marathon in March, this is a great place to stay as it is within a mile of the start/finish area which is at the Colosseum.

A positive is that it is downtown, very close to the train station and one of the Holy See basilicas. It was about a 15 minute walk to the coloseum. A negative is that it is a 15 minute walk from the coloseum and other key sites. So, non-ideal but this makes it a cheaper option than something right around the corner from those famous sights which, of course, is a positive. Another negative is that it is in an old building in an area that there was a morning market, which can be loud in the morning. Also, the rooms are what you would expect of a 2 star hotel, so don't expect the rooms themselves to be a 4.5 star room. However, what made this hotel a great experience was the staff. The hotel is family run and they are a very nice family. They are very energetic and will do just about anything you ask. They gave us great recommendations for food and were incredibly friendly.

On arrival Antonio was there to greet us, he along with the other staff were so friendly, helpful and very accomodating. The room itself was cold on arrival although warmed up quickly with the heating available, bath was a little disapointing but the room was clean, comfortable and adequate for all we needed. A lot of reviews mention the early morning noise from the market in the street, we were in room 20 which was on that side, the first morning the noise did wake us up but we found due to the amount of walking we did it was not a problem for the rest of our stay. Breakfast was a buffet that was always fresh and plentiful, cappuccino very good. Rome really is a beautiful city with so much to see, our highlights were the Trevi fountain at night, the Collosium and the Vatican although enjoyed all of the others too. Rome could be an expensive stay but we researched before we went to ensure best budget eats, Napolli just opposite Hotel Giuliana is a very good and reasonable pizza, Pizza Forum in Via di san giovanni in laterano did a fantastic bruchetta, lasagne, water and coffee for 10 euros each, Cafe Cafe do a lovely hot chocolate for 3 euros each, forno campo de fiori also great and the hazelnut Ice cream in Il Gelato di San Crispino was stunning.

Location is no more than 20 minutes from nearly any big site, big rooms with a great bathroom, coffee-store coffee whenever you want and many more things. Wife and I stayed there for 6 nights in late February. We had room 10 which we asked for because we didn\u2019t want to be on the other side which is over the pop-up marketplace on a side street. That might have been a little quieter because seemingly every scooter or motorcycle with a loud muffler came by the street from 6am on. But the reality was it was never an issue because even getting up at 830, Italy\u2019s work schedule of 10-8 never made the noise an issue. Better were the people. We dealt primarily with husband and wife team Marianna and Antonio (literally the early shift and the late shift). Seriously, it was hard to do better than this couple. Get it done in the am and the best chat after a long day. Not all Italians are this friendly or good with English and with making you feel welcome. Our room was a pair of twins put together (just like on a cruise ship), a desk, a real safe built into the wall, night lights for reading, great window over the street, a full service bath with bidet (do Europeans really use these?) and a small refrigerator to keep our beers and sodas cold. It was literally USA size at economy (winter) rates. Towels were like you\u2019d read (not so thick and kind of rough) but never failed to dry after a trip to the shower that had nearly as many spouts as the Fontana de Trevi. The beds looked really fatigued with a big sag in the middle, but never once, gave a bad night\u2019s sleep or any kind of ache. Don\u2019t let what you see ruin the reality. We also had free WiFi that helped us research the next day and if you needed something printed, just ask. Breakfast was the simplest of simple with a cheese, bread (and toaster), some Danishes, fruit selection, yogurt and three cereals. No meats or multiple cheeses, but really, keep it simple and have 2 espressos instead!! If you need a full breakfast just ask where to go (Irish pub and B&B down the street) and you\u2019ll find it for 5 Euros. Just as great are the shops and eateries within 5 minutes. We\u2019d forgot Tums and ibuprofen - that\u2019s right across the street. Want soda and some local goodies? Around the corner is a supermarket. Want some excellent Italian food? How about 4 places ranging from 6-12 Euros for pasta dishes. Bar Viminale was one our favorites for fast and easy, including take-away. At the end, it was hard to leave. Rome is incredible to visit and H.G.\u2019s facilities and people made our visit a genuine Roman Holiday. We can easily see why they are so highly regarded on internet rating sites.

The breakfast was great and there's a little balcony outside to sit on when it's nice out. The shower is heaven with actual water pressure (!).

As this was a trip for my birthday and on the strength of the good Tripadvisor feedback I went ahead and reserved a room. The hotel is near to the Termini Metro station. From Fiumicino airport I hopped on a bus costing 6 EUR that took just under half an hour to get to Pyramide Metro station, from there I got a 1 EUR travel ticket and travelled the couple of stops to Termini. The cobbles on the way to the hotel are a bit challenging for suitcase wheels but I managed to get to the hotel in just under 10 minutes. As others have commented there is a modest \"Hotel\" sign by the door and you have to go into a lobby area to ascend some stairs to the hotel itself. There is a rickety looking old lift but as it was only a couple of flights of low rise steps I always used the stairs, it was quicker than waiting for the lift. Initially we were given a \"superior\" room, number 20 and informed that we would need to swap to another room the following morning. This wasn't exactly ideal and I had thought that as they were aware I was staying for my birthday that this had been a little courtesy extra. To be honest I didn't consider the room to be superior. It was clean, well appointed and of a good size. The bathroom had a shower over bath affair but in the afternoon there was no hot water and the shower was a trickle. I reported this to reception but was glad that I would be moved to another room. The following morning we werer given room 10 on the front of the hotel and this was a lovely little room. Slightly smaller than our previous room and with a shower cubicle rather than a bath but it suited us down to the ground. We were given complimentary air conditioning (usually 10 EUR) for the bother of moving rooms and it was greatly appreciated as temperatures hit 29 degrees outside. The beds were comfortable and the room was clean. The shower itself could have done with some descaling but showers in the morning were hot and the water supply was more powerful than in room 20. Yes there are ocassionally street markets outside but actually I found the noise levels perfectly acceptable and I was so tired from sight seeing it didn't overly affect my ability to sleep. Breakfast was a rather basic affair but I cannot bench mark it against other hotels in Rome. There were pastries, cheese triangles, fresh fruit, juice, yogurts and bread/ toast. Tea and coffee was freshly made to order and lovely. All staff and the hotelier, Marianne, were exceedingly helpful and friendly with impeccable English. The restaurant opposite provided a good evening meal but I can whole heartedly reccommend eating at the restaurant just a few minutes walk away next to the opera house, a family run business since 1908 and the food was delicious and fairly priced. Do get a table inside as the street tables don't have a great view. Eating and especially drinking out in Rome can be a costly affair, up to 8 EUR for 400ml of draught beer! Good food was in plentiful supply and I thoroughly made use of the cities gelateria, if you see a Blue Ice chain do go and get one of their grande cones, the choice of flavours was the best I found, even in the smaller stores of the chain. Location wise the hotel is about a mile away max from the main sights, it wasn't too far to walk to the Trevi Fountain of an evening for a good meal there. On the return journey I got a train from Termini overground station costing 14 EUR and took about 30 minutes straight to Fumicino airport. The trains depart from around platform 28 which is a bit of a walk once inside Termini station so allow about a good hour to get from the hotel to Fumicino. I loved Rome, the transport was exceedingly good value but as all the sights I was interested in were within walking distance (even Vatican City if you enjoy walking as I do) I couldn't really cash in on that value. Eating and drinking out hit me very hard and one night I spent over \u00a3100 at a lovely seafood restaurant near the Trevi Fountain for a bottle of cheaper Prosecco, two starters and two mains! Generally I'd say allow around 70 EUR per person for three courses and a bottle of wine and a tip. As I'm not used to staying in city hotels and as it was a rather late booking I cannot comment on the value, I feel booking early is essential to get the best deals. A 5% discount was offered on the hotel should I have paid in cash and I am informed that this is a usual tax dodge employed by most establishments in the city. In the end I paid by card and there was an additional 16 EUR city tax that had to be paid in cash. There were some return visitors to the hotel while we were there and i would certainly consider the Guiliana again when I hopefully return to the city.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cVery nice, clean, and friendly\u201d", "Author": "imatraveln", "ReviewID": "UR119115317", "Content": "This is within easy walking distance to nearly all of Rome's top sites and an easy 10 minute walk from the train station if you have just small luggage (we had roller carry-ons).

The wife and I went for our Honeymoon, stayed in three different hotels through Europe, two in Italy, and this was by far the LARGEST ROOM and the BEST BATHROOM we had - not sure what you value in a room but we realized after we left how nice we had it. The only reason I'm giving one less star for sleeping quality is because we had a Double Superior bed which is essentially two twin beds pushed together and it can be challening at times but for the most part wasn't a factor. We were about one block away from the \"Hop On Hop Off\" bus stop so that was prime as they take you everywhere. You're also around the corner from tons of restaurants, walking distance to the Trevoli fountain and many other sites. We met the owner and her daughter, very friendly people, did everything in their power to make your stay perfect. Called a cab anytime you needed it, printed out train schedules if you were only curious, recommended items to eat, wines to drink and were very accommodating incase you came back and were still up for a drink they had a full bar and were willing to help. Also this was the only place we stayed at the included the breakfast in the price which was great. Overall I say location was perfect, area is safe and perfect: two later bars in walking distance, about a dozen restaurants in crawling distance, a tobacco shop next door, pharmacy across the street, atm on the corner, plenty of gelato nearby, main sites in walking distance - no more than 10 minutes or so depending on where you're heading. Also, if you're not a walker, which I wasn't after a few days, you can cab it to any main attraction for under 10 euro (be VERY CAREFUL with cabs! - the front desk gave me the scoop on what to look for otherwise I would have been scammed plenty of times)", "Date": "April 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orangeville, Canada", "Title": "\u201cA home away from home\u201d", "Author": "brittnila", "ReviewID": "UR104203378", "Content": "Hotel Giuliana is the BEST hotel I stayed in while in Italy.

We were greeted warmly by Antonio, who helped carry my luggage in and had us checked in to our comfortable room within minutes. The hotel is nicely decorated with modern and beautiful furnishings, yet still holds the historical appeal that comes from an 18th century building. The atmosphere at Hotel Giuliana is warm and welcoming all the way through. The room was good sized for a hotel room, and was again beautifully decorated. It had a large window that over looked the street where the market was held every day, a mini-fridge and a safe. The t.v. was small, but since we don\"t speak Italian and we did not travel from Oregon to watch t.v. it posed no problem for us. The bathroom was BEAUTIFUL with marble counters and a bathtub/shower. And although the shower guard looked small at about 2 1/2 feet (far from the 10\" that Rnegadea claimed) it was more then enough, and we never once had a problem showering and water didn't spray all over the bathroom. The bath towels were nice and big, and all of the towels were soft and spotlessly white. The double bed was nice and comfy, with spotless linens, a nice soft blanket and a warm bed cover. After Antonio showed me how to work the heater/air-conditioner the first night our room stayed nice and warm. There was a slight smell to the hall but it is a very recognizable one that is caused by age, it is not unpleasant and very normal for any building that is so old. The breakfast area is nice and offered pastry, fruit and toast. There was juice and other drinks available but the best part was that they made your coffee as you ordered it- espresso, tea, cafe americano, you name it and they made it at their coffee bar. In a business where the norm is a coffee pot set out for guests, this is another example where Hotel Giuliana goes above and beyond for their guests! The location was perfect. It was a short walk to shopping, cafes, restaurants, and many tourist sites. For the sites a bit farther away, Termini station was only 7 minutes walk. Or the staff was always willing to call a taxi for us. The churches within walking distance were amazingly beautiful and worth seeing. I loved everything about our 9 day stay at Hotel Giuliana, but what makes this 2 star hotel worthy of a 5 star rating is hands down its staff. Antonio was always smiling and very helpful with all my questions. He showed me how to operate the heater control, brought my luggage up, found me some extra pillows when i asked.He also made a drink for me and my partner before we went out for dinner one night, and when we came back engaged to be married, he offered a hug and many congratulations. When asked he admitted to knowing that my boyfriend was going to propose!!! I don't know of any other place where people make you feel so comfortable that you want to share your life changing moments with them! And i felt just as comfortable with the rest of the staff, they were all kind and helpful. The night/early morning staff Ashwin and Federicod, always greeted me and answered any of my questions even at 3 a.m. in the morning when i was awake trying to adjust to the time zone change! Marianna who worked the day was always helping us figure out how to get where we wanted to be and even marking it on a map for us. She was knowledgeable about transportation options and was able to give us accurate travel times off the top of her head. She helped us plan our train trip to Venice and told us how and when to purchase tickets. She knew the best places to shop and when i ended up with 2 more suitcases of items then i had arrived with, she recommended having them shipped home to the U.S. She found out where i could do this, printed up the address and called a taxi to take me there. She felt like an old friend and as with Antonio and Jean i found myself sitting for 30 minutes or more talking about all manners of things. On the day before we had to leave, another guest at the hotel had a frightening experience while out at night, when the guest had to go to the police station to file a report Marianna went with her and translated for her. She was there for 2 hours. Once again above and beyond! And that leads me to Jean who is the force behind the magic. She and her family treat the guests as if we were family too. I found my self on 3 occasions talking with her for over an hour about life, careers, religion,love,family, hopes, and dreams. It was wonderful to find another person with such a caring heart. It shows in everything she does and it has passed down onto her family and the rest of the staff making the Hotel Giuliana the best \"Home\" away from home i have ever been to. If you want a excellent and inviting stay while you are in Rome this is the place to go.

The location worked out very well for us. It was within easy walking distance from Termini (but not so close as to be in any way sketchy) and had a grocery store just a block or so away. We were able to walk to almost anything we wanted to see in downtown Rome, and there is a small street market with knockoff purses and some produce and clothing, etc., on the side street adjacent to the hotel's building. We weren't bothered by the street noise and couldn't really hear it unless the windows were open. When closed, the windows shut out a lot of the sound and chilly air. As for the staff, we just didn't have the same experience as other reviewers. I don't think we ever met the owners or managers. The person behind the desk was always very businesslike and polite, but certainly not friendly or especially approachable. They were able to answer questions about bus or train locations, maps and such, which is all we really needed from them and so we were satisfied, but we had the eerie feeling each time we came in that we were guests in someone else's home and had interrupted them in the middle of some more important task. Our room was fine, neat and clean to the eye. Yes it did have that overused airplane restroom smell, but after living in old buildings for half my life I think it comes from the older plumbing system and not from lack of cleanliness. Having said that, the smell could get pretty thick at times and regardless of the source, it was tough to sit in the room at times and forget eating there. The bathroom at least in our room was really fantastic though - clearly a fresh remodel, tons of hot water and a nice sized shower. We also had a small fridge in our room...not sure if it remains on though when you leave the room and take your room key out of the charger though. The items in the fridge weren't too overpriced - there is beer, water and soda as I remember it. That was really convenient. We never had the breakfast but we did drink the lovely coffee that is made for you upon request and really loved it. Overall we found this a fairly average small hotel - nice, but nothing special.

Giuliana is a beautiful and bustling 10 minute walk (with luggage) from the Termini station. As you enter from the street on the ground floor, you might wonder about your choice of place, but as you enter Hotel Giuliana on the 1st floor (2nd floor to North Americans) you enter into a personal, quiet, and very pleasant hotel. Since this hotel is family run, the feeling is more like a B&B. All the staff know you and all are eager to assist you in getting around Rome, making plans for the evening, and calling to research things on your behalf. The breakfasts are very good from a European perspective - a full continantal breakfast and then some. Most importantly, the cappuccinos, lattes, and espressos are first rate. We liked that fact that almost everything we wanted to do in Rome was just a 5 to 15 minute walk away. As well, we were in a location where real Romans lived. We liked the authenticity. We also liked the fact that we weren't in the hustling, over-crowded areas like the Spanish Steps or Trevi fountain. Great places to walk to, but I wouldn't want to be surrounded by that for my stay. Hotel Giuliana is also just around the corner from Rome's main opera house. We took advantage of this - and also took advantage of the very good and un-touristy restaurants in the vicinity.

Rome has two subway (Metro) lines that form an \"X\" with Termini at the intersection of both. Most buses have stops at metro entrances clearly marked at the bus stops; so after a day of walking around you can catch almost any bus to get to the subway to get to your \"Roma Home\".

They are fluent in both Italian and English and staying there is more like staying at a favorite Aunt's house. The management suggested places to eat and provided knowledgeable directions.

We booked and paid for a standard room but were given a larger superior room on arrival as it was quiet (we didn't ask for this and were charged the lower price for a standard room). It was immaculately clean with useful facilities such as tea/coffee making facilities, a programmable safe in the wall, a wall-mounted hair dryer, TV and bath & shower. The towels and linen were changed regularly and the room cleaned every day. The hotel is maintained to a very high standard and rooms were being renovated during our stay, although it appeared to be painting etc which didn't disturb us in terms of noise. The hotel is run by a family, and at least one of them was present every day. They were most anxious that we were happy with everything and were more than helpful in terms of suggesting places to visit and local restaurants to go to. They were very happy to chat and answer all our questions about local life and customs. It was very good value for the location, standard of service and facilities.

We (laughably now) tried to mask the smell by purchasing some air freshener but unfortunately this did nothing but accentuate the pungent smell. We had to sleep wtih the windows wide open (middle of winter, noisy traffic) to try to get some respite but unfortunately had no sleep due to the street noise. In the morning we went to speak to the male staff member who looked embarrassed and then said he knew what it was and that he would get the maid to fix it. We were not staying in that hotel after our sleepless night and so asked if we could leave without being charged for the further two nights we had booked. He said we needed to speak to the female staff member and when she arrived, she said she could move us to a room that didn't smell! This made us both extremely angry as if she had an empty room that didn't smell, why would she put us in that one?! We declined her offer, although the room did not seem to have the same stench we were very upset and exhausted having had no sleep, and paid the cancellation of one night and got out of there! As we were leaving she informed us that nobody had ever complained before. Obviously a blatant lie given the other reviews on this site and the male staff member's reaction to our complaint. Extremely disappointing given that we had booked the hotel on the basis of reviews on this site and that this was the last hotel of our trip. Appalling that they would charge a cancellation fee as there is absolutely no way they should be letting that room to anybody.

We spent seven days there which is a long time for a city stay but it gave us ample time to see most of Rome with some of the sites visited a second time to get a better understanding. We never felt threatened even at night, I know some people are worried about this aspect of city visits but just be sensible and walk where you see the locals and other tourists and you will be ok. You can eat really well at a reasonable price if you seek out the restaurants and trattorias the locals use.

I have been raving about Giuliana to all my friends and family, and am willing to recommend it to all.", "Date": "July 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Herts, England", "Title": "\u201cWonderful gem of a hotel\u201d", "Author": "flossybun", "ReviewID": "UR18087090", "Content": "We stayed at Hotel Giuliana for a special occasion and could not have been happier, we loved the hotel.

At the end of the road on which the hotel is located, is the beautiful Chiesa di Santa Maria Maggiore (a useful landmark to head back towards to find the hotel again when you are new in Rome). The room was very comfortable, and the A/C unit provided cooling respite from the July heat in Rome - we had fabulous hot sunny weather throughout our stay, so explored most of the morning and came back to the hotel for a nap and to cool down before heading out again! The hotel staff are all so welcoming and friendly, always cheerful and greeting you as you come and go, and happy to advise on questions you have, or to recommend places to eat or visit, and they always go the extra mile to make your stay special. In my case I requested something for the room for the special occasion and they had this all ready when we arrived - great service. If your Italian is rusty or you don't have much knowledge at all, the staff here all speak English well. This is a lovely little hotel where you are made to feel at home. Breakfast is a selection of fruit, yoghurts, bread, croissants and cereals, juice and tea and coffee, just enough to get you started for a day of sightseeing. A couple of recommended places for food, That's Amore, almost opposite the hotel, very handy if you don't want to go out too far in the evening, and Otello on Via Della Croce near the Piazza di Spagna.

There are wonderful restaurants very nearby and there are 2 gelato shops, one next door and one attached to a bar around the corner. We had to change our date of arrival because our daughter unexpectedly needed hospitalization, so Jean and Marianna worked with us to either hold a room at Giuliana or find a room for us elsewhere if they had no cancellations. Luckily, soon after we arrived a room became available and it was fantastic. After being in a Roman hospital for a week, admittedly anywhere would have felt like a palace. But the spacious (for Rome!), clean room adorned with lavish marble and a grand lavatory was luxurious. Breakfast was perfect, cereal, yogurt, cheese, croissants, juice, etc. Another plus is that there is a tour company down the street from the hotel. Normally we would tour the city on our own, but with our daughter we decided it best to take a tour. Since she wasn't feeling to par, we took the Ciao Roma bus tour which has a flexible schedule, as you can jump on/off the bus as you please. It was perfect.

The location is a short walk from the Termini and the bus stops are close by. We could easily walk to the Spanish Steps and the Coloseum. There was a Tabachi shop, good restaurants, gelateria and a couple of bars within a hundred feet of so. Breakfast was modest but good. When I reserved the rooms I used Trip Advisor as my primary reference. I used Rick Steves guide book (the traveler's bible) for all of our other accommodations in Venice, Florence and Monterosso, CT. The Hotel Giuliana was not in the 2007 book but it read so well I took a chance. I'm told the Hotel made the 2008 edition.

My parents room was pretty small, but had a queen bed, desk, nightstands and television. Their bathroom was rather small. The room overlooked a daily market. Though I was afraid they'd hate the noise, the market is completely closed and quiet at night. It did get going early, but my parents are early risers on vacation, so the setup noise didn't bother them at all. My room was larger...a double bed and two twin beds, a desk, two nightstands, and a television..though the fit was tight. There wasn't much room to walk around. However, I had and very large bathroom, which was a pleasant surprise. The bath/shower combo was such that water got on the floor if you weren't careful, but I think that's pretty typical. I just used an extra towel to handle it. Our room overlooked a courtyard and was much quieter than my parents' room. The curtains in both rooms were such that you could make the rooms VERY dark for sleeping if you wanted. The rooms were kept very clean, and the staff was absolutely wonderful. They'd ask where you were heading for the day, and offered to call ahead to check hours or tours for you. They'd ask if you needed walking directions, metro directions, or a cab, and would call a cab immediately if you wanted one. The Rome Marathon was taking place while we were there, and they had great suggestions for avoiding traffic and closed restaurants, etc. If it looked like rain, they'd even offer umbrellas. They were always smiling and friendly and happy to answer questions. If you want some snacks in your room, they can give you walking directions to a grocery store and a quickie mart that are both easy to reach. My dad and I had a blast exploring the grocery store. The staff was also happy to direct you to local restaurants that were \"non-touristy.\" We had some very good meals this way. Breakfast was a real pleasure each day. They'd make you fresh cappuccino that was to die for, and there was a great selection of fresh fruit , yogurt, and breads. My kids can get picky about breakfast and they were quite happy with the selection. My parents were also happy with breakfast. I've stayed in many other hotels in Rome...even the St. Regis Grand and the Grand Hotel Parco Dei Principi...so I can be a hotel snob. Those are where you stay if you want luxe.

They were some of the friendliest, most intelligent, most helpful people I have met.

For the active traveler who will appreciate being within walking distance of Trevi Fountain, the Pantheon, Spansish Steps, the Forum, Capitoline Hill, Palatine Hill, the Baths of Diocletian, the Metro and Termini Station, check out Hotel Giuliana. We had considered others, and even checked rates and availability of a couple of them. I think what pushed me over the edge was a previous reviewer who said to \"just stop your looking and book this one while you can\". I fully concur! We arrived at Termini Station via the express train from Fiumicino airport (having on a previous visit used an airport/hotel shuttle, I found this to be quicker and easier because of the Giuliana's location , which is an easy walk with rolling suitcase). As you zip along in the train and look out at the creeping traffic headed toward the city, you might be happy you chose the express train. The Giuliana is on the second floor of a rather bland looking building just down a tree lined section of Via A. Depretis, around the corner from the Opera House. You must be buzzed in through the castle like front door and take the quaint lift but, we never had to wait at all for either. We felt very comfortable coming and going day and night in the area. Not once did we feel at all concerned while wandering around the quiet back streets and alleys in the evening looking to find that one gelato place we hadn't tried yet tried. Upon our arrival in the mid-morning, our room was not yet available but we were shown where bathroom facilities were, and where to stash our luggage while we embarked on our sightseeing adventure. The friendly greeting and the cheerful and immaculate condition of everything there made us feel immediately at home and re-assured by our choice. We had a double room on the street side of the hotel which we found to be very quiet (sound proof glass in the windows) and a convenient way to judge how we should dress for the weather, by looking out at the passers-by on the street below. Every person we encountered on the staff was just so friendly and helpful to us. It was helpful to us also that they all spoke english as they arranged for reservations at the Borghese Gallery (highly recommended if you can get tickets), and also for a tour at the Vatican Museum (the tour is worth the cost if you don't like lines). Their willingness to take the time to talk with us, and share about themselves, their lives living and working in Rome, and their families, made our experience there so much warmer and more enlightening. We observed people checking in who were repeat visitors (which is always a good sign) and being given up-dates on what's going on at the hotel and the family style staff that works there. I know this is a long review, but we travel quite a bit and when I come across something that I feel is special, I feel compelled to share a little info with fellow travelers. The Giuliana is not the Ritz Carlton, but neither was I looking for that. What it is, is a great little botique type hotel for people who appreciate a well run small hotel, immaculate in every way, in a great location for the traveler who's intention is to really absorb the culture of a city.

I walked to Vatican City (about 30-40min) and to San Giovanni in Laterano without too much difficulty - but do take a map with you. They supplied local maps free. The room was comfortable, with ensuite and the safe was quite adequate for personal belongings.

There was also a microwave for heating milk, etc. The hotel serves only breakfast and later in the day serves coffee and opens the small bar.

The room we had overlooked the road and it is noisy when you have the window open but as soon as it's closed you can hardly hear anything, plus the airconditioning works a treat so no worries about sleeping in a sweat box! Location wise it's great. The first day we accidently stubbled across the Coliseum as it was only about 10 mins down the road. What also found really useful was the fact the Termini Station was so close, about 5 mins walk if that, as we got the train down to Sorrento later in the week. There are three restaurants on the same street, we only had the chance to try one, can't remember what its called but it has lots of fairy lights, anyway it was ok, but we thought the service was a little disappointing.

HOTEL LOCATION & GETTING AROUND The hotel is located in the Viminale area near S. Maria Maggiore (a very impressive church) and is only 10 minutes walk from the Termini station. The Forum, Colloseum and Trevi fountain are also only 10 - 15 minutes walk from the Hotel. We did in fact find Rome fairly compact in general and only used public transport when we visited the Vatican which would have been a good half hour walk away at a decent pace. If you do choose to use public transport, I'd recommend getting a 4 EURO Metro pass which is valid on the Metro and the bus network all day. You can also get a ticket on one of the numerous open top tour buses which also lasts all day, however at 13 to 18 EUROS, this is an expensive option. That being said, I would recommend using one of these open top buses to orientate yourself with the city when you first arrive. Just make sure there is room on the top deck before you board as you don't get the same sense of direction if you're inside the lower deck. THE HOTEL If you're reading the reviews on tripadvisor, you will be well aware that the hotel is located on the first floor of a larger building. As you enter the building, the ground floor may well lead you to question whether you've made the right choice, however as soon as you get to the hotel itself on the 1st floor everything is OK. After a simple check in process, we were shown to Room 18. A perfectly adequately sized double room, with TV, tea making facilities and reasonably priced mini-bar. The bathroom was surprisingly large with a shower and a bath. (From some of the other reviews I was expecting just a shower). Some non-Europeans may be surprised to see that the bedroom floors are tiled rather than carpeted. This is fairly common in Southern Europe. We realised shortly after arrival that we had forgotten our travel adapter so I went to reception to ask where we would be able to buy one. This is where the exceptional service kicked in - \"No problem\", I was told, \"Here's one you can borrow!\" From the beginning to the end of our stay, all requests and questions were greated with enthusiasm and a smile. Whether it was a restaurant recommendation, advice on how to get to the attractions or simply a cappucino after a particularly tiring day walking around the Vatican Museums and St Peters. I normally stay at chain hotels however after my stay here, I'm now reconsidering that philosophy as the service we received at this family owned hotel was much much better than we've ever experienced before. The only negatives, which didn't bother us too much, but may others: - I think the plumbing in the builiding is quite old and I couldn't get a stable temperature in the shower. We were quite happy to have baths instead, however if you do get a room without a bath I'd check this out before accepting the room. - Also linked to the plumbing issue, you could also sometimes smell the drains. It wasn't awful, just an occasional whiff. This could be managed by keeping the plug's down in the bath, bidet and sink. - Lastly, our room overlooked a street market which set up quite early in the morning. I'm a heavy sleeper so it didn't bother me, but my wife was woken up by it a couple of times. My advice is make sure the window and shutters are closed, however remember you are in the middle of a city so associated noise is to be expected. In conclusion, this is an excellent hotel in a great location that represents excellent value for money.

Tube and bus fares were cheap and travelling in the morning rush hour was a real experience. Wouldn`t have missed it for the world. We walked nearly everywhere, which gave us a chance to see more of the buildings and back streets, where there were some hidden gems.There are plenty of places to stop and rest your feet whilst having a cup of coffee, or whatever you fancy, and do some people watching. Although there is a market near the hotel it did not bother us, neither did the traffic. Our rooms were quite spacious and the beds comfey, a must after all that site seeing.We could find no fault especially with service and the considerate staff.

The bathroom was perhaps worst of all - no room for toiletries and the shower area is so small that I was constantly hitting the taps with my arms, resulting in a shock of freezing or boilling water, depending on which tap I hit. That might have just been my clumsiness, but there is very little room to maneuver. Worse than this, the exhaust fan in the bathroom, instead of sucking out the steam from the shower, seemed to be blowing in sewer gas from the toilet vents. Very nasty. I'm confident that there are much worse hotels in Rome, but I'm equally confident that you can find better than this for the price.", "Date": "October 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cThe Giuliana is definitely a jewel\u201d", "Author": "cristalfla", "ReviewID": "UR5964190", "Content": "I can't say enough about this hotel.

They were helpful right from the start offering a reasonably priced taxi service from Ciampino Airport (50euros). The entrance though not over inspiring does have an air of security about it. The hotel reception is on the first floor, you can reach this by either lift or stairs.

We found the room very satifactory in size with an efficent air conditioning system. The bathroom was a reasonable size and clean. Clean towels were provided daily and the room was cleaned every day. The street outside could be noisy at times (what do you expect in the heart of Rome) but by closing an effective double glazed window can soon resolve that problem. I wouldn't rave about the breakfast but it was adquate and the coffee was nice. The location of this hotel is excellent near to plenty of pizza bars restaurants etc, The main railway station (Termini) is a short walk away as is the metro and you are within walking distance of many of Rome's great sights, including the wonderful church of San Maggiorre which is a less than a 5min walk from the hotel.

Outdoor noise: ever wonder what it would be like to have your bed floating above an intersection in downtown Rome? Well, we certainly are no longer wondering. Bathroom odor: to say that our bathroom smelled would be like saying there are a lot of churches in Rome. The smell, just like the number of churces in Rome, is not something you can really grasp without experiencing it for yourself. There was something predatory about it: the more you smelled it, the weaker you became.. as if your will to escape it was being sapped. Imagine carbon monoxide, but substitute the smell of an odorless gas with the smell of death. The bathroom itself, an olfactory shrine of evil, was quite small, however. So small, in fact, that the door only opened 45 degrees before hitting the toilet. So small, in fact, that half your body stuck out of the shower (I'm not kidding).

We chose the hotel mainly because of the reviews on TripAdvisor. We found the hotel to be in a good location, just about a 10 minute walk from the front doors of Termini Station and less than a 20 minute walk from the attractions, such as the Coliseum, Forum, Pantheon, Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain. The area in which the hotel is located is safe and clean and is located at the end of a little tree-lined street, so it's easy to find. There are several restaurants and cafes in the area of the hotel, as well as banking machines, and a few shops. The staff at the Giuliana was second to none! They went out of their way to search train times and flight times for us and to make recommendations for seeing the sites and for dining. Whoever was on the desk when we left for the day or returned at night was friendly, cheerful and always ready to assist us in whatever way possible. As we spent two days there at the beginning of our trip and two days at the end, they allowed us to leave a piece of luggage there until our return. I can't say enough about the Customer Service at this hotel. The breakfast was simple, but very good. It consisted of Cappucino (excellent), orange juice, fresh fruit, cereals, croissants, packaged sweet rolls and yogurt. The breakfast room is small, but cosy and has a bar as well. There is a table out on a little terrace just outside the breakfast room where you can enjoy a coffee or a drink at the end of the day. The room was about what we expected. It was very small with two twin beds pushed together (pretty standard in Europe). The linens were clean and fresh. The bathroom was large by European standards and was also very clean. There were shutters on the large bedroom window that overlooked a small side street. I was happy that we weren't in a room facing the front because I had read (and heard) complaints about the noise there. I am here to tell you that there is noise on the side street as well! In fact, every morning there is a market on that street and the vendors start setting up around 5 a.m.!!! We often didn't get to sleep until 1 or 2 because of the street noise, so that didn't leave us a lot of time to sleep. We asked if there was a quieter room available, but there was not. One morning of our stay (our last night in Rome), a truck pulled up directly under our window and left the motor running for quite sometime while its driver banged and clanged around setting up his place at the market. The fumes that drifted up and through our shutters were sickening and we eventually got up to shut the window (then it got very stuffy). Although the weather was beautiful and one didn't require air conditioning (nice breeze at night), it might be a good idea to request it, if only to drown out the street noises. All in all, we had a wonderful stay. However, we will look for something different for our next stay. There are plenty of options in this price range (160 euros/night). The reason we would go elsewhre is mainly due to the noise factor. Another reason is the lack of Internet accessibility for guests. Most of the other hotels we stayed in across Italy had either free or inexpensive Internet access in the lobby or breakfast room.

The first and foremost thing that stands out in my mind with the Hotel Giuliana, is their outstanding staff! I actually sought out the owner, as I wanted to compliment her on the caliber of her staff. They were extremely helpful with every and any question we had. The hotel's common area is very charming and inviting. Our room was of a good size, including the bathroom, with comfortable beds and fresh linens. The breakfast area is also very cozy and a good breakfast was provided. The location was also very handy, as we could walk to several major attractions, as well as having easy access to the Metro. We ended up extending our stay in Rome three days more. The Hotel Giuliana could not accommodate us for the last night as they were fully booked, but the hotel staff went out of their way to find us other accommodations, even going as far as escorting us to the new hotel. I cannot say enough about our stay at the Hotel Giuliana. We were not disappointed at all with the recommendation, and preferred it to our original hotel in Rome.

I was traveling with my ten year old son who wanted to see the ruins of Pompeii so we got the train into Naples (about 2 hours direct) and then a train to Pompeii (another 20 mins or so).

The rooms are a good size, not massive but not too small and they are well kept and clean. The reception area and passage way had been recently redecorated.

I have to say that I spent a LONG time deciding on which Hotel to choose (we were going to be staying 6 days and 5 nights and I wanted to be comfortable), but this is where Tripadvisor is great and after much searching and comparison decided that the Giuliana was the one. From the very start Jean was more than helpful, and can arrange anything you might need. People who post on this site saying that it was not value for money should compare Giuliana's prices to other Hotels. yes, it is pricey but what do you expect from a European capital city? At least with that price comes a very clean room, comfy bed and warm atmosphere. The lobby and the building (which someone complained about earlier) merely adds to the charm. LOCATION I wasn't sure about this at the beginning, and would have preferred to be in the Trastavere, but actually, the Hotel is so convenient for arrival into Rome from the airports (into Termini) and is is so close to Republica metro and bus routes that you can get anywhere you want very quickly. I would also add to those who can, just hail a taxi from outside. To get from the Hotel to somewhere like the Spanish Steps/Trevi Fountain/Piazza Navonna it only costs about 8 euros (about \u00a35-6, and if there are two of you it's so worth it). Most of the time though we just stepped out and walked - a lot, it's the only way to see a city. We were pleased at the end of the day to be coming back to a quiet location, rather than a side street off the busy-ness of say, Campo de Fiori. There is a local restaurant across the road from the Hotel (directly across the road) which was VERY good value for money - and great pizzas. ROOMS Our room, no.11, was the furthest from reception and so quite quiet (though I am not saying that it's a noisy Hotel inside, far from it!). One downside is that all rooms face onto the street and on one side there is a market which starts setting up at about 6am, but it's not that noisy at all and if you have earplug with you you won't hear a thing!) Our room as very clean indeed with a large bathroom and comfy beds. Cleanliness is very important to me when travelling, but this Hotel should take pride in it. THS SIGHTS/MONUMENTS MAJOR WARNING WHICH CANNOT BE EMPHASISED ENOUGH!!!: Vatican Museum and St Peters Basilica: GET THERE EARLY - seriously! We were lucky enough to bump into some people we had met on our plane out (a lovely Canadian couple - if you read this post your email address we'd love to get in touch!) and so we jumped the 2 hour long queue. It's worth getting there for 8am and you will walk straight in. not much fun to be queuing, especially in the autumn when it's raining! For most monuments I would advise getting a good historical guide or the audio guide headset thing. Rome has the most history of any city I have ever visited and things to see, but has NO SIGNS ANYWHERE telling you what it is you are looking at! I found this particularly frustrating when I was at the Roman Forum and was clearly looking at a pile of rubble which I knew had massive historical significance, but had no idea what it was! At the end of the day when you go on a city break the Hotel is really only a place to sleep in, but Giuliana felt more than that. A couple of time we came back a little earlier before dinner and had a nap - ask in reception for a cup of tea or coffee and they bring it to your room. I loved Rome and we had a wonderful time, and the Hotel Giuliana was a good place to stay and I would stay there again and recommend it to others.

I found them on tripadvisor and was pleased with the reviews. They are a small, eleven-room, family run hotel. We had to e-mail each other several times to accommodate my tentative arrival and departure schedule. They were fast with their responses. When I walked in the door, I gave Marianna my best \u201cbon JOR no\u201d. She replied, \u201cYou must be Mr. Hughes, welcome\u201d in British English. I later met Marianna\u2019s mother Jean, the owner of the hotel. We had many nice chats, including one with a friend of one the employees who spoke no English. I sipped my coffee as Jean effortlessly volleyed her conversation between English and Italian, telling us stories and having us both laughing. Breakfast was fresh coffee, juice, milk, cereals, fruit, yogurt, and croissants. The breakfast area itself is rather small, but that forced me to join some others. That was nice and I even had dinner with two couples one evening. I stayed in the single room (11). It has a single bed, shower (no tub), dresser, TV, a shelf, and safe. This is the only room without air conditioning, so a fan was supplied. As this was September and the room has a window that opens fully, this was okay. Jean tells me air conditioning is coming to this room, a good idea, I think. The size of the room is what I expected. European rooms are much smaller than their newer cousins in North America. I\u2019ve been to various parts of Europe so this was not unexpected. Fine for one person. The last night I stayed in Rome my friend who lives there stayed with me so she could see me off in the morning. I asked if another bed could somehow be added (worked for one night but I wouldn\u2019t suggest this in lieu if getting a double room.) Antonio did this cheerfully and I didn\u2019t realize what trouble I had put him through until I saw that he had to rearrange the entire room. Of course, I paid for an extra person but he could have easily said no since it was a hassle for him and both his boss and me would have been none the wiser. Now, the entrance. It is a large wooden door at street level. A simple sign says \u201cHotel Giuliana.\u201d The hotel itself is on the second floor (first floor European.) When you first open the door, you get the impression you are walking into an old warehouse. Don\u2019t let the entrance fool you! The hotel neither owns nor controls this part of the building, so please give them a break on it. It's well lit and it is a strange entrace, but not creepy or anything like that. When departing one morning for a daily tour, three ladies where entering. As they lugged the door open, they looked at their surroundings. One said \u201cOh, my...\u201d I quickly intervened and told them \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it really is! Go up the stairs to the hotel entrance.\u201d The elevator is small. If you have a lot of things, like the three ladies I ran into did, I suggest you do what I told them. Place your luggage in the elevator and send it up, walking the stairs yourself. The steps are right next to it and we\u2019re talking about a walk up one floor, not up the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The elevator in an older, open shaft model so you can see where your luggage is even after you send it up. Bottom line: The entrance is different than what you\u2019re probably used to or may expect, but it\u2019s no big deal. Really. I know some say that that the staff is expected to be polite; hospitality is their business. That is true and I can\u2019t disagree with their logic. I\u2019m just saying that friendly and accommodating service seems to be rare, yet Hotel Giuliana has an abundance of it. I would like to comment upon some recent reviews. We\u2019re all entitled to our opinion and I do respect that. A reviewer from Toronto suggests that these reviews are biased in some way. I tell you truthfully that I have never been in Rome before, I have never stayed at Hotel Giuliana before, and I have never met the owners before. I don\u2019t \u201cown their stock\u201d so I have no financial bias, and have nothing to gain by making something up. I\u2019m not sure what sort of bias I could possibly have. Another reviewer suggests that people don\u2019t pick a hotel because of staff friendliness. For my fairly extensive business travel in a cookie-cutter Hampton Inn, he is correct. In America, I\u2019m \u201chome\u201d, no matter where I am. But this is different. I\u2019m a foreign country where I speak ten words and, despite pre-planning research, am unsure of the local customs, transportation, and so forth. A friendly, helpful, and engaging staff suddenly becomes more valuable to me. As another angle, consider the many people who travel to the same destination year after year, staying at the same small resort in, say, Wisconsin. Many of us know someone like that. Does their resort of choice have an upper hand on all the others due to how nice it is? I\u2019ll wager you the main reason is that they have come to know the owners. Always make your reservation directly with the hotel. Avoiding a middleman can\u2019t hurt. Would I stay there again? Yes, and I hope it is soon. If I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d feel like I was snubbing some old friends.", "Date": "October 16, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Rooms": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cOk for short trips\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4022412", "Content": "We\u2019ve been to Rome second half of September 2005 \u2013 2 adults and a 7 months old baby, and stayed there for 4 nights. I know some Italian which proved very useful. Location The hotel is conveniently located \u2013 about 10 minutes walk from Termini station, relatively civilized area. Few restaurants, few caf\u00e9\u2019s, a small super-market very close, and street markets until 11 am, right beside the building. The super-market with extended hours was extremely useful to us, since the baby needed lots of things \u2013 bottled water, food diapers etc., and we couldn\u2019t dine out every single night \u2013 so it was good to have a place to buy food and stuff in a hurry. The hotel - general The entrance of Giuliana is quite hidden \u2013 2 big wooden doors leading into the street, and the building\u2019s lobby kind of scary \u2013 they share it with others. The elevator is from the beginning of the century and looking like hasn\u2019t been serviced since. We are not that fussy to need the elevator for the first floor, but we had a umbrella stroller for the baby and it was hard to get in and out the elevator with it. The reception & breakfast area is small but clean and modern. The room was quite big and very clean, the bathroom was sparkling clean as well. We also got a play-pen for the baby. They have a fridge in the room but the power goes off every time you leave the room so don\u2019t expect to keep the stuff cold for a long time. People complain about towels \u2013 I found them not that bad, they were clean, not cashmere-soft but well\u2026 hotel towels, of course I had my own for the baby. The breakfast was good, not extraordinary good, but good: coffee, 3 cereals, yougurt, fruits, bread, jam, croissants \u2013 I brought it in the room every morning because the baby was adjusting to 7 hrs jet-lag and he was waking up at 9:30. The price we paid for the room \u2013 160 euros per night + extra air conditioning, was kind of high for the service. The staff The staff \u2013 polite and English-speaking \u2013 is their own business after all. We didn\u2019t need special treatment or directions because we travel a lot and we are able to get around by ourselves. The only thing we asked was a city map which any hotel in a city like Rome could provide, but I found a better one at a tourist info center near Santa Maria Maggiore. I can\u2019t say a lot about friendliness because we didn\u2019t come to Rome to make friends with the hotel owner, but to visit the city. Closeness to major monuments Mind that we traveled with a baby in tow, so it took us longer than average, we had to stop a lot to feed the baby, change the baby and sometimes entertain him. We walked everywhere, except Vatican city where we took the subway \u2013 if we had been without baby, we would have walked there too. Not advisable to get into buses or subway because of pickpockets. It took us about 20 minutes walk to get to Traian\u2019s Markets, Roman Forum, and about 30 minutes to get to Colosseum \u2013 measured from the hotel. We couldn\u2019t go on Via Sacra - the road was too bumpy for the stroller. It took us about 1 hour to get to Fontana di Trevi and Pantheon \u2013 good walk, lots of street markets and real Italian life which was great. Overall, Rome is not that big, and if we could do it, anyone could \u2013 just get a good map from one of the tourist-information points. It\u2019s free, and you will not need the hotel staff to plan your trip. Also bring a city guide, so you won't have to spend money on audio-guides everywhere - there is too little info provided at monuments. Conclusion Giuliana is okay for short stays, a bit of pricey though. Please, who is choosing a hotel over staff friendliness? They are all friendly because they are paid to be so. If I recommend the hotel: yes \u2013 clean, close to Termini, walking distance to monuments. If I would go there again \u2013 I would enquire first at 3 stars hotels on Via Nationale or Via Depretis, if I would get better price, probably I would go there. For sure I\u2019ll keep Giuliana in mind for a next visit to Rome.", "Date": "October 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cDon't be fooled!\u201d", "Author": "FamilyTraveler2327", "ReviewID": "UR3997096", "Content": "There have only been a handful of reviewers on this site that I've found to be truthful about this hotel.

My husband and I stayed there for 7 nights between Sept. 10-17. On our second day in Rome, a thief copied our bank card number and emptied our account. The hotel staff could not have been more genuinely concerned and helpful. They let us use the computer to check our bank account, they explained the cheapest and easiest way to make a call to the U.S. and they even sent one of their own staff to the bank to act as our interpreter. And that staff member then went above and beyond of his own accord, taking the time to lead us to the police station despite being off-duty at that point. The day-to-day service was equally impressive. They made dinner reservations for us, got us tickets to the Museo Borghese, made excellent restaurant recommendations and generally accommodated our every request promptly and with a smile. Don't think by all this talk of service, though, that that's all the hotel has to recommend it. Our room (No. 8) was very nice - large comfy bed, excellent shower with great water pressure and plenty of hot water, and, best of all, superior air conditioning that we could control ourselves. Most places in Rome are not air-conditioned, so it was pure bliss to come back from a hot day of sightseeing and be able to turn the AC to the temperature we wanted. Breakfast was more than adequate. There was variety enough to suit about any palate - 3 kinds of cereal, fresh fruit, yogurt, bread and cheese and prepackaged pastries - and the freshly made cappucino is wonderful. And the location is ideal - my husband and I walked everywhere, and even the Vatican, far to the west, only took us about 30-45 minutes to reach.

The closest major attractions to the hotel are the Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain and the Coliseum. The furthest major attraction was the Vatican, but you can easily get a subway at Termini Station that stops there. The hotel is located on the entire second floor of what seemed to be a commercial building. I would describe the Hotel as comparable to a bed and breakfast in the United States. There is an elevator to the second floor, but the elevator is quite narrow on the inside by standards in the United States. All personnel of the hotel that work the front desk speak English. This is a huge asset. The staff can provide invaluable information and assistance in planning or refining your itinerary. Do not overlook this!

The staff is also very friendly and likeable and they really go out of their way to be accommodating. They are really nice people. My room in the hotel was good. Neat as a pin. The bathroom was spotless. The air conditioning worked fabulously. The room was equipped with a safe.

This was the best hotel we stayed at in Italy.", "Date": "December 1, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cOn balance we were pleased with the Giuliana\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2857761", "Content": "The staff was without exception cordial, friendly and helpful. The breakfast was generous. The room was a very comfortable size and the bathroom was beautiful. We appreciated having a wall safe in our room. Our only quibble is that the room might have been a bit cleaner. But I would definitely recommend the Giuliana to friends looking for a hotel in Rome.", "Date": "December 1, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Giuliana", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d253436-Reviews-Hotel_Giuliana-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$79 - $198*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Agostino Depretis 70</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00184</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "253436", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/88/92/8892d83ce5507f6cbb2aad349296fc201large.jpg"}}
