I was not sure what to expect but although it was quite basic it was spotlessly clean and well equipped. The beds were comfortable but the sofa was not. The bathroom could perhaps do with a bit of updating. The staff were pleasant and helpful. We loved the ducks that wandered around the park, some with a row of ducklings in tow. The washing machines in the laundry were good and everywher was well cared for. The barriers on the gates gave a bit of trouble but e suspected we were not terribly proficient in their use. All in all excellent value for money and the nearby beach is lovely.", "Date": "Nov 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR780764145", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "luxurydiva"}, {"Content": "Dissapointing Stayed at Sydney Lakeside for a weekend getaway. The service right from arrival was poor with staff showing little or no interest in the guests on what seemed to be a very busy weekend. Check in was a problem with confusion over tariff despite our proof in writing of the nightly fee. We needed matches to light the oven to make breakfast on Sunday, and made the mistake of going to the office early. We eventually got the matches after much castigation and 20 min wait. Finally on departure, an overseas guest had arrived early and wanted to use the toilet. They were told they could not use the facilities, could not check in early and would have to wait down the end of the street as there is no onsite parking. Think seriously about staing here folks. We stayed in a villa for $240 per night. I think your money is spent better elsewhere", "Date": "Mar 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR274632196", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Curtis787"}, {"Content": "Excellent Stayed at the Sydney Lakeside last year, what a wonderful place and location.Even though it is essentially a caravan/camping park, we stayed in a 2bdr villa, I have to say the accommodation was first class. Could not ask for a better standard of accommodation. My kids loved the small lagoon were they could paddle and feed the ducks, the beach was excellent. The sea is quite rough and ideal for surfing but does have a swimming pool built into the sea, as so many australian beaches do. The accommodation is near to a shopping mall - approx 20min walk the beach is just over the road, no more than a 5min walk as is the bus stop to take you into Sydney.Would recommend a hire car - but public transport is excellent in both service and value.Narrabeen is located about 45mins - 60mins from Sydney by bus (very frequent service) or by bus to Manly and ferry to sydney (the best way to arrive into Sydney) - an all day ticket including the bus and most ferries costs AUD$15.00 approx \u62e27.00. Personally I prefer this location then staying in Sydney itself, you need to explore the Northern Beaches area of Sydney - Fantastic - great walks great beaches - forget Bondi head this way instead.Had originally booked accommodation in Sydney itself so glad I cancelled that and stayed here instead. if it is your first time to Sydney then stay in the city, but if you have been before give Sydney a miss stay in the Nortern Beaches area.My kids keep nagging me to go back, would not hesitate in coming back at all, just need to save the pennies.", "Date": "Jul 9, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR774468761", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "dearmrman"}, {"Content": "Great place I've stayed here on 2 occasions in different types of accomodation - Bungalow and Villa all ensuite with kitchen and very modern( villa was more spacious) and not had any problems at all. If your looking to stay in the hustle and bustle of Sydney Central then this will not be for you although i had no troubles at all commuting to and fro as public transport here is spot on and very reasonable (a bus to manly then a boat took you to sydney harbour) you can purchase a day travel card from any bus driver - well worth the money! The Park is situated next to the lagoon which is very child friendly for children that are happy to paddle in the water. Its also close to local shops and a 2 minute walk to an absolute diamond of a beach. In the evening the site puts on movies for the children outside although i was known to watch a fair few! Theres a park onsite, public payphones, laundry facilities, internet access,a games room, tv room for campers and a selection of books. Kitchen facilites with cooking also for campers. Staff are always on hand to give you help and advice. Theres also a cafe at either end of the holiday park if you fancy being lazy.", "Date": "Mar 4, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR981281564", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Bluey1981"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d584587-r23254202-Sydney_Lakeside_Holiday_Park_Narrabeen-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html", "HotelID": "584587", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
