The hotel was a little disappointing, poor cleanliness and frankly a bit depressing. What a difference a year makes - don't know if there has been a change of management but it was a much friendlier, more comfortable place to stay this year. Room was very clean - still the decor was a bit shabby, but I expect Travelodge rooms get a hard life. The public areas were also very clean and tidy and the breakfast was very good. We had breakfast in the hotel and the children ate free. As much as you like, good hot food, wide selection of cereals and even fairly decent coffee from a machine. Good value for money. A much nicer place to stay this year and parking tip - the Travelodge website is not that clear. 24hrs parking is \u00a35, after 15.00hrs it is \u00a33.00 until 12.00hrs the next day.

Went to reception and had no difficulty in being given another room, still on the ground floor but on the opposite side. The difference was like night and day, no street noise at all. The booming noise from the TV appears to be reception difficulties and only affected ITV (was not there to spend all my time watching TV so not a problem). Room and bathroom was typical travelodge, clean and spacious, the shower was brilliant, the bed was comfortable. Plenty of towels which were replaced everyday, as was the biscuits (also stayed at a best western where biscuits were not replaced at all) , Breakfast was good no issues apart from thier useless toaster which takes for ever and you could see how this would be a problem if they were busy, Ordered one evening meal which was disgusting - chips looked like reheats, puff pastry was brick hard and filling looked congealed, no problems in refusing it and getting money back.

The room was overheated- and it was impossible to open the window wider, as it seemed to only be attached by one hinge and a bit of string. The bathroom stank of mustiness, there was no extractor fan, and as a result (I guess) there was mold in the tile grout. The matress was very old, and consequently sagged. We stayed two nights. The second day, the room cleaning left a lot to be desired. Maybe I expect too much - but shouldn't they wash up the cups?

The hotel itself is not situated in central london. It is in zone 4 and it is close to an overground train service. In order to catch an underground service you have to walk some 30 or 40 mins to the nearest underground station at Kew Gardens from where the District Line goes through from Richmond. We stayed in other Travelodge hotels before so we knew what to expect. It is a no frills hotel - so I suggest you check in their website what they do not provide in their rooms. Incidentally they provide more things than other no frills hotels. The hotel is situated on North Street and next to it there is a nice old church and in front of the hotel there is a small garden on the quay - an nice place where you can take lunch or a small stroll. Up the road there is a drive through McDonalds and if you walk down the road in the opposite direction you will find a Steam Museum and another museum of music. The river Thames is also close by and can walk onto the bridge crossing the river. There is not a lot of greenery around the hotel. If you prefer not to walk to the Kew Gardens underground station, you can take one of the more frequent buses which pass from North Road. The room was clean, nice clean carpet, properly hung and clean curtains and we found the usual kettle and the nice assortment of coffee, tea and milk on the tray including two mugs for our perusal. Everything was clean and nicely displayed (including the menus for the breakfast and other meals). The bathroom consisted of a shower with shower curtain, sink with plenty of space where to put lotions and other commodities and of course the toilet. As with all travelodge hotels, there are no toilet brushes but every morning the cleaner comes in and does a perfunctory clean of the room and bathroom. If you want to replace your towels do not forget to put them in the shower so that the cleaner will know that you need new ones. There is no carpet in the bathroom and this is also explained in their website. The cleaner will do your bed but will never touch anything which is yours. Your pjs or nightdresses will remain where you left them and they will not tidy the room at all. The first evening we suffered some noise from our noisy neighbours but fortunately they left that same evening and the only noises we heard where the cars passing from the main road outside the hotel. We also had a faulty bedside lamp and asked for it to be changed and it was fixed on that same day. The receptionists at the desk were always helpful and always with a nice big smile on their faces. The first night we ate at their own restaurant of Travelodge but I would not recommend eating there unless you like the prepackaged ready meals that you normally buy at leading supermarkets. On the other hand they do serve alcohol at the bar. You will be able to pay extra for more TV stations and you can also pay for Wi-Fi. The bed was clean with nice clean sheets and pillows and we had an extra pillow if we needed it. The bed was a bit too soft for what we are used to but it was sturdy and did not make creaky noises when lying down on it. In the room there is plenty of open shelves and also an open wardrobe. They provide bins in both the bedroom and the bathroom and they are cleaned every day by the cleaner. The mugs are also cleaned daily and the coffee and tea tray is replenished every day. Downstairs in the lobby there are two machines with candy bars etc in them and you will also find shaving foam if you forgot it or pain killers if needed. In short this hotel like others of Travelodge is located in a nice (peaceful area for London) and the hotel itself is clean, has friendly staff and good customer service. I would recommend it for those who know how to travel to central london or do not need a central positioned hotel but want to stay in a nice, clean, friendly environment in a safe area of London.", "Date": "March 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cockermouth, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPerfectly Adequate Budget Hotel\u201d", "Author": "traveldoc65", "ReviewID": "UR98282283", "Content": "Stayed overnight with some trepidation after reading the reviews on here but needn't have worried -the hotel was perfectly adequate for our needs.A good 10 minute walk from Kew Bridge Train Station - set back from the road so was difficult to spot so had to ask directions several times but was in fact on the correct road.Efficient and friendly check in.

They probably figure everyone has cell phones now, but our daughter got sick and we kept having to run downstairs to buzz somebody at the front desk (and they were often slow). What if a person traveling alone had an emergency and couldn't contact the front desk from the room? This seems a health/safety issue. There's also no a/c, often not a problem in UK but rooms are stuffy if you happen to hit a heat wave (they will provide fans on request, but you have to ask, and you have to go down to get everything--they won't bring stuff to you). Location is awkward unless you know SW London very well, which we do--and if you do know it, you can save a few bob by staying out here. It's nice to walk to be able to walk to little museums like Kew Steam and Musical, or to Kew Gardens. It's quiet and there's a nice Indian restaurant at Waterman Centre nearby. Breakfast \"buffet\" is lowish in quality but all you can eat for eight pounds fifty; it helps that kids eat free, and there are a couple of cheaper cafes in a nearby parade of shops. If you're on a tight budget (especially with a family) and you don't mind staying out a ways and having minimal service, the place could work.

The problem is that if you arrive for breakfast either early or late you are likely to receive a fairly reasonable offer but if you arrive at the busiest time the offer is appalling. You are likely to be faced with no cups, crockery or cutlery, tables left uncleared, food depleted or missing altogether. They are unble to cope when the hotel is busy. Buy the breakfast voucher after you have checked the restaurant - this way you can guarantee the service and offer. If busy, you can get a breakfast elsewhere and save yourself the heartache!!

Wonderful ensuite, a search revealed one tiny bit of black mould in the shower/bath tiling, otherwise spotless. Plenty of ice-white fluffy towels, plenty of pillows. Bed extremely comfortable with immaculate, smooth, white linen. The room was very spacious, about 20ft by 12ft. A 5ft (king size) bed and a seven-foot long sofa, hanging space, shelves, one chair. Everything in excellent condition and clean. In reception there are three vending machines selling ice creams, cold drinks (a can of Coke is 90p so it's not extortionate) and snacks like pot meals, chocolate bars, crisps, also toothbrushes, headache pills and shower gel. Next to these are internet terminals. The hotel faces across the Thames and Kew Gardens but apparently there are no windows on that side of the hotel, which seems very weird! But you can walk across the road where there is a park set above the river. Our 2nd floor room faced a decrepit, ugly building down a side street. The window opens and you can look sideways over the river. You can lay in bed and watch the planes descending on the path to Heathrow. They are not noisy, even with the window open, but quite interesting to watch. On the Sunday morning we were rudely awoken at 8am by the sound of pneumatic drilling right under our window as the council workmen renewed a bit of tarmac, but that isn't the fault of the hotel. There is a bus stop right outside that takes you to Chiswick High Street, an excellent shopping street, lots of restaurants and quirky designer shops as well as chains, The bus goes on to Stamford Brook tube station and then to Hammersmith bus station, which is a better choice because there are lots of buses into central London, although the tube will get you there much faster. Hammersmith has two separate tube stations, about 300 metres apart, so very easy to get to South Kensington, Earl's Court and into the centre. Kew Bridge railway station is also very close, takes you straight to Richmond, Clapham Junction and Waterloo. The hotel is extremely convenient for Kew Gardens which is a walkable distance. There are two small museums just metres away from the hotel: the Musical Museum and the Kew Steam Museum. There are hot drink making facilities in the room and the staff replenish the tea, coffee, sugar and milk daily. We paid about \u00c2\u00a339 a night --- just \u00c2\u00a320 each! The only thing that stop me giving this stay a perfect rating was the cafe-bar. The decor is really trendy and wonderful, the food was nothing gourmet, it's rather like chilled supermarket food reheated in your microwave, but that's acceptable because it's really cheap in comparison to a proper restaurant. What let this place down was the staff! At dinner the service was slow, they forgot our dessert, despite having few customers. But breakfast made me knock two stars of the overall rating, which is sad! Although there were three members of staff running about it was a farce. It's a help-yourself affair, with egg, bacon, sausages etc laid out in hot dishes. But when we got there some bits were missing and it took them far too long to replenish them - quite a ridiculous amount of time! Then when they did replenish one thing, another had run out! So you could have egg and sausage, but no bacon, etc. (PS the egg is scrambled and tasteless, no idea why they cannot provide friend eggs like everywhere else). I've eaten at many of these self service hot buffets and everywhere else the staff had sufficient intelligence to keep everything topped up all the time. The situation was not helped by the fact that the manager was totally ignoring the debacle that was going on before his very eyes in favour of fiddling about with the till! The situation annoyed me so much that I intended writing the manager a letter when I got home but in the end I didn't. He can read it on here! This breakfast isn't \"free\" - it costs \u00c2\u00a36 and if I had walked into a cafe and been given half a breakfast and made to wait twenty minutes for the other half I would have walked out. But I guess in a hotel you are a \"captive audience\" - they've had your money upfront and so you are hardly going to walk out, are you? If we had not had dinner or breakfast this stay would most definitely have been 5 stars straight! If you cannot get a cheap room in a central London Travelodge, or are visiting Kew Gardens, this is a good budget option, and it will cost you \u00c2\u00a32 each way per day, plus an hour's travel each way, to get into central London.", "Date": "April 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leicester", "Title": "\u201cNew Year 2008/9 Disaster\u201d", "Author": "ThemTwo", "ReviewID": "UR24449076", "Content": "Good Points - Breakfast and the breakfast team.

There were several other people in the same predicament. We were offered a taxi to another hotel. However, we had our dogs with us and therefore we had to go in our own car. Firstly, we were offered another hotel close by. I asked the duty manager, Hannah to ensure they would accept the dogs. She did not ask them on the phone and when I asked her she said they would accept the pets. To make sure, I asked her to call the hotel again and the hotel said they would not accept pets. We were then offered a travelodge hotel in Brentford and was informed it is a 'centre of excellence'. If this hotel is a centre of excellence I dread to think what the other hotels look like! We then travelled back to Kew and discovered another customer checking in at reception. When I questioned the receptionist about this I was informed, very rudely that this customer had arrived earlier in the day to guarantee a room. The customer arrived back at reception 2 minutes earlier to say that there was someone already in this room! With much persuausion we were eventually allocated a room (even though I had been informed there were no rooms left). The room was filthy. The toilet had not been cleaned and had faeces on the toilet seat and the duvet was covered in stains which looked like dried in vomit! I complained to the duty manager, re sending us to the 'centre of excellence' hotel and about the cleanliness of the room and she replied 'do not fuss with me'! Eventually, we were given a room in Heathrow terminal 5 for one night and we were informed we HAD to return back to Kew for the rest of our booking. I informed her we would not return to this filthy hotel and she said we had no other alternative but to return there the next day. Arrived at the heathrow hotel to find it was modern and reasonably clean. We were told the next day we did not have to return to Kew. Phew!! On the third night our keycard would not allow us access into the lift or to our room. I went to reception three times and eventually it worked. However, the room had been cleaned and they had changed the duvet cover with a cover which had stains on it and the bathroom sink was covered in pubic hairs. I went to reception to complain and the receptionist and duty manager informed me very bluntly that their policy is to change the duvet cover after the 4th night stay and therefore it must have been the duvet we had been using. They were both very rude and incorrect. We were allocated another 4 rooms and each room smelt badly, had stains on it and was not clean. When we were on our way to be shown another substandard room, the member of staff was talking to a colleague through a walkie talkie and we overheard them saying we were 'complainers' as we complained in Kew and to not give us another room.

Planning to head into central London to shop, eat and see a show, we told the receptionist that we were here and that we did not need our rooms or room keys, we just wished to ensure that if we returned at 11/11.30pm later that day there would still be a room. Names and booking references exchange, assurances made, we left. Fast forward to 1130pm - No rooms (we had booked and paid for two doubles). We were promised a speedy taxi to the nearest available lodge (Heathrow Term 5) and the receptionist advised that the taxi would take @ 15-20 minutes, but to have free drinks while we waited. An inattentive bar man mutely shrugged to any question we asked and we gave up and helped ourselves to cups of tea. Taxi arrived.....driver didn't know where he was going and took us to the terminal building. AN HOUR AND A HALF later we arrived. Checked in swiftly and fell into bed. Next morning arriving back at Kew at 0930 the receptionist advised us that we still hadn't got rooms.....despite many promises the night before that whatever time we arrived the following day we would be checked in. I know it doesn't make sense, we did know that the hotel couldn't miraculously magic us a room on a Sunday morning when it didn't have one the night before. The duty receptionist did suggest that last night's shift said it to get rid of us! Then when I asked her why she had assured us of our rooms and booking security the day before and we ended up being shipped out to elsewhere, she told me \"I don't have to justify that\" Funny, because I would have thought that the first responsibility of your job was to look after your customers and do what you say you are going to do. To be fair, I do think that she did her job and did it well. I think she was let down by careless handovers between shifts and no set procedures for booking people in. Anyway, we finally were allocated one of our two rooms at about 11am and when we returned at 6pm we got the second. The final Griswold (National Lampoons vacation reference, for those unfamiliar) moment was when at midnight; I could hear tapping on the door next door followed by my Dad's voice. Then tapping on ours. The muppets had only allocated other suckers to their room. Only my Mother's love of double locking every room she ever stays in saved them from the embarrassment (and terror in my Mother's case!) of Mr/S Sucker getting into the room. When they returned to reception Mr Reception frog-marched them back to the room to get to the bottom of it. This ended up with my naked hubby sticking his head around the door (in the style of a tortoise emerging from his shell) and suggesting that we discuss it in the morning, while Mr Reception continued to ask to see our original booking confirmation.

Nothing much going on in Brentford but gives easy access to get into London, onto the M4, Chiswick & Richmond. Buses stop just outside and Chiswick is about 15 minutes walk or 5-10 minutes by bus. 15-20 minutes bus ride is Richmond. A 20 minute direct train into Waterloo leaves every 15 minutes from Kew Bridge. 5 minutes walk away. South Ealing is the closest tube and a bus will take you right to the door of the hotel. Boston Manor is not near at all. Kew Bridge tube is also a good 20 minutes walk away. Restaurants and bars are poor around Brentford - McDonalds is close by and the Thai restaurant is good. I've never eaten in the lodge's restuarant. Premier Travel Inn is just down the road and the rooms have air conditioning which in the Travelodge they don't. Windows will only open a few inches and in the summer the rooms are like saunas. This was often a complaint from customers during hot nights in the summer. Holiday Inn Express by the canal at Brentford is very nice and more of a business hotel - like the Premier have well decorated rooms and air conditioning. The bar and restaurant is also very good here. The rooms in the Travelodge are functional and clean. Some have baths and others don't - request a room with a bath if needed. If you are a non-smoker watch out if you arrive late as the hotel will check you into a smoking room and there is a strong smell of smoke. Disabled rooms are available and are spacious. The staff would often try and book me into one which wasn't a preference. Family rooms are good and have a comfortable sofa - I would request these rooms at check-in at no additional cost and request a front room facing the Thames. Ground floor rooms are closer to traffic noise and main entrance. There is a small seating area at the main reception and a microwave is available. Somerfields is about a 5 minute walk away. The Travelodge appears to suck all the goodness out of new recruits who start very enthused and gradually lose all motivation and acceptable behaviour when serving customers. I have witnessed many arguments directed by staff at reception to customers and a general stressed or unenthused manner. Check-in can take a long time and there is never enough staff on. I have experienced reservation problems where there has been no booking - only to be found on a different system at the main reservation call centre! The staff have a transactional approach to service and don't expect any kind of recognition if you have stayed there previously - I never did and they don't enter into any kind of rapport building. Overall - they do their job ok and it is noticeable when someone is in a good mood or is motivated as they have just started. Breakfast is inconsistent as it will sometimes be left outside your door and other it won't. There was times that they ran out of breakfasts and would not offer a sandwich as an alternative.
