Car Parking: As we had arrived by car we were informed that since it was Easter street parking would be free until 9.00am on the Tuesday. The hotel has no private parking. Parking turned out to be 2.5km away at the Olympic Stadium. The up side was parking was \u00e2\u201a\u00ac8 for 24 hours plus a return tram ticket for each person in the car, there was still a 500m or so walk to the hotel at the end of the tram ride OK no big deal in the way of a walk but a nuisance. If you stay in Amsterdam it would be best not to take a car. If you want to see the bulb fields and the Keukenhoff Gardens by car then think about near by Haarlem. There is a tram stop just outside the hotel will take you to the city centre, just buy your ticket on the tram. Room: A little small but very clean and well looked after. The room had a TV, twin beds, a safe and a mini fridge but no tea / coffee making facilities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for that you had to go down to the lounge/breakfast room. The shower was over the bath which while it worked well is something I dislike because of all the climbing in and out but again the room was very clean. The bedroom had a small \u00e2\u20ac\u0153balcony\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd shared with another room that provided a view over the back gardens of the surrounding buildings. Somewhere to go to check the weather but little else, it didn't even provide much light to the room. Food: Self-service breakfast which was OK but nothing special, choice of cereals, cold meat, fruit (some fresh some tinned). The hot food was scrambled egg \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a little over done, beans, and sausages etc't., didn't try them so can't comment on the quality. Various breads were available along with croissants. The toaster was of the light domestic variety and took too so long to do anything I was loosing the will to live and settled for scrambled eggs on warm bread. Orange juice from a machine, coffee from a machine, which was very good... what does it say about the place if everyone talks about how good the coffee machine was? The breakfast room itself was clean but a bit too utilitarian for 4 stars. Want and evening meal? Not available. For anything other than breakfast or snacks you have to leave the hotel (this is 4 star remember). Fortunately the street has many good restaurants to choose from but on a wet night with the temperature at 5C it would have been nice to have the choice to eat in the hotel. Checkout was as easy as checking in but I was a bit miffed having to lug the cases into the car while two members of the staff stood smoking. Perhaps I was expecting too much from a 4 star hotel.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "edinburgh", "Title": "\u201cdissapointed\u201d", "Author": "EdinburghTimbergirl", "ReviewID": "UR128104672", "Content": "we stayed here during Febuary when the weather was very cold,we booked through Venere,whom still on their website promote this hotel as offering \"free drinks in the lounge\" we have stayed with this hotel a couple of years ago when they offered an all inclusive package,so when i saw the price on Venere for our dates i jumped at it,what a dissapointment when we arrived,the hotel has been taken over and no longer offer all inclusive and asked if we wanted to buy breakfast,again we thought this was included,i wasnt happy to say the least,we didnt purchase breakfast as it was overpriced.

Most important terms for me were presented: not too far from city center, English breakfast and free wifi internet in rooms. The first contact was nice: pretty Indonesian lady in reception was very friendly. I checked-in at 6 p.m. and on the same time a male person came to work to front desk. I saw coffee machine in breakfast room and asked from female person, how much I have to pay for coffee. She said that coffee is free of charge. On the same time guy from reception added that I have to drink coffee in the same room and I can not take the cup to my room... Strange, but OK. I entered into my room on the 3rd floor and it was very cold. The reason was a window, which was not closed. I tried to close it, but it was quit tricky, because the mechanism was broken. Somehow I was successful and thanks to air conditioner in a hour my room was more-less warm. As I had to prepare some documents, I tried connect my laptop by wifi to internet, but the signal was too weak for it. The same result with iPad. I called to reception and described the problem. Guy from front desk was very unfriendly and he suggested to take my computer with me to lobby because there the signal is stronger. I did not like this solution and asked to change my room. The answer was negative. Arguments were that there is only 5 free rooms in hotel and maybe crowd of people from street will enter and want book all these rooms. And... he has to send a cleaner to my room, if I will leave it! I explained, that there is no need for cleaner, cause I just arrived and everything is clean. Result: nothing! First time in my life hotel was not changing my room when I asked that. At morning I had breakfast with my colleague and it was really good and tasty. But... during the one hour in breakfast room we did not see any other hotel guests. So it was really hard to believe the argument of the front desk guy, that hotel was almost full.", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangalore, Karnataka, India", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Stay At The Savoy Hotel.\u201d", "Author": "Iceman_1983", "ReviewID": "UR122696739", "Content": "First of all please let me start by saying this hotel is way under rated on trip advisor. I stayed at this hotel from 24th December 2011 till 28th December 2011 with my wife and we had an amazing stay. Before leaving for Amsterdam I must have spent more than 100 hours on reading reviews and looking at different sites for hotels and was worried about the ratings but after the stay I can definitely say that this hotel which has a rating of 7.0 is way below for what you get for the price. It is like 15 mins drive from the airport. We took the connexxion shuttle which was 50 euros return trip for 2. For the hotel we paid Euro 367.00 including breakfast (which was decent compared to the 15 Euros/Person the rest of the hotels charge) and city tax of 5%. Tram 25 and 12 takes you to Dam Square and the tram station and is a stone throw away from the hotel. It is in a very nice and peaceful area with the police station next to it. Everyone at the reception was amazingly helpful and friendly. The rooms were spacious and the beds were comfortable. Lots of places to eat around inlcuding indonesian, thai etc. Places like Heinkein experience and Albert Market are like 2 stops by tram. Other places like van goh and rij museum are 2 mins away by tram. It is a non smoking hotel but u can smell the weed and in the hallway which as a smoker i definitely did not mind ;) . Overall very nice hotel for the price you pay. I would recommend it to anyone going to Amsterdam. I really don't think you wold get anything better for the price this hotel charges. P.S : If you stay here then I will advise you to get the I AM AMSTERDAM CARD...for the duration that suits you since you will use the trams a lot and get free entry to a lot of museums and a free canal cruise.", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood value\u201d", "Author": "scruffyduncan", "ReviewID": "UR118353926", "Content": "I only really slept at this hotel as I was in Amsterdam visiting friends.

Upon check-out we were told that since we made phone calls (i.e. the attempted calls to the front desk) we had to pay for them.

Nicely designed bedrooms, free drinks and snacks, location that's off the tourist trail in a nice part of town. But this time it felt ordinary - like any small chain hotel, and its weaknesses seemed more apparent. My room was pretty grubby on check-in. Freshly trod-in chewing gum on the carpet, fingerprint smears all over the window (shame as the view of the church was great). I complained about that on first night but it took two days and a reminder before anything improved. The guests seemed to be a pretty generic tourist crowd - the place just didn't have any buzz. Compared to, say, the Hotel Mozaic in The Hague, which I've used a fair amount recently and is lovely (and cheaper), the Savoy just didn't feel special. The public areas are part of the problem - there's no light. So it's all a bit dispiriting. Some redesign of the ground floor might be an idea, even if it means losing a few ground floor bedrooms, to open the space up. Free internet is always always appreciated, but it was of the erratic / infuriating variety, dropping in and out. Sharpening up of housekeeping would do wonders, and adding a bit of pizazz to the decor, marketing and promo would make a difference as well. Given it's in the Pijp, and at a time when you've got good-value hotels like Citizen M popping up in the city, the Savoy could compete much more on style if it put its mind to it. For now I fear it will decline towards ordinariness. Which is a shame. I would have recommended before. But not after this visit.

There is also a free tea and coffee machine in the breakfast room. The fruit juice machine was usualy empty by 4pm and not refilled. My one gripe about the room is that because the windows are designed not to open you are reliant on the efficiency of the a/c unit on our third night it stopped working and the room soon became sauna like.The few staff we came across in the hotel seemed friendly enough other than the manager a midde aged asian guy who needs sending on a customer relartionship course.

Quite refined but not the 5-star poshness which you would not miss.

We had a DVD player, a big plasma and electric beds that went up and down!! Also, to our surprise the rate included breakfast, anything from the mini bar plus you helped yourself to drinks in the lobby which was very nice in front of a lovely log fire!! Only thing was its location really, we had booked to stay really close to Dam square but eneded up a good 30mins walk away or a few tram rides.

It's a short 10minute tram journey to the traditional tourist areas of Dam Square and the RLD but only a 2 minute walk into an area very popular with twenty and thirty-something locals and packed with excellent restaurants and bars/cafes. Everyone is extremely friendly towards tourists as they tend to be fewer in number and not of the 'lads-on-tour' variety. On the other hand, the hotel could benefit a great deal from some minor adjustments. I'm pretty thick skinned having stayed in some questionable places whislt travelling etc but I find it pretty grotty waking up in the middle of the night to find your face directly on the mattress because the bed-sheet is too small for the bed and there is no mattress-protector, goodness knows whose face was last there. My wife actually had to take anti-histamine tablets for a rash she woke up with having virtually discarded the bed-sheet during the night. Also, I prefer a double room to be a double room, not a twin, especially on a romantic weekend away! Finally the air-con clicks continually when it reaches the correct temperature, this woke us up both nights so we had to get up to switch it off, you can't open the windows so in summer it's too hot for comfort. It would cost very little to make the necessary improvements that would secure this as a first choice alternative to the more expensive central hotels.

It was okay, I don't really regret staying there, but I'd look around for something else first next time. The hotel is brand new so everything was pretty spotless and nice. The room was comfortable and the bathroom very nice -- big bathtub! But, the negatives started to get annoying. The double bed was actually two twins pushed together. It was either sleeping 50s style (goodnight honey) or slipping down into the crack between the beds during the night. The bare mattress was covered with just a flat sheet and a comforter on top -- okay, I've seen that before here in Europe but it's pretty disgusting. You move around a little bit and discover the sheet is on the floor and you're lying naked right on the mattress. And your *** is probably not the first the mattress has met. There were a few other minor inconveniences, but otherwise the hotel is nice, comfortable, and enjoyable. The BIG negative though is that this is not in the center of town. There are a few restaurants and shops in this area, but if you want to go down to the REAL center, it's 15 minutes on the tram or bike.
