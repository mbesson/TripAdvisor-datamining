You really have everything you need, and if you want to stretch your legs, you can head up to the rooftop terrace (with a bar and an amazing view) or down to the first floor with its cozy library and cheery lobby fireplace. The staff went above and beyond, offering suggestions for everything from restaurants to boating trips on the Bosphorus, and helping out in little ways like calling cabs, offering tea (or more potent beverages!) or replenishing wood for the fire. You can't beat the location--it's within a couple of minutes of the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, the Islamic Art Museum, Topkapi and the Grand Bazaar, and there are perhaps two dozen restaurants within a five block radius.

I think we were the only travellers with kids, but Ibrahim Pasha was the perfect place to stay - right near all the main sites in Sultanahmet and just a short walk to lots of good restaurants. Room 205 (overlooking street at front of hotel) was lovely - set up with a cot and with the sofa made up into a bed for our 3 year old. There is a teeny elevator - but enough to bring the stroller up and down. We had a view of the beautiful Blue Mosque from the room - and with the iPod dock, and kids movies on hand, even staying-in was pleasant and comfortable. All the guys at the desk and at breakfast were helpful and friendly - and great with the kids. I would say my only criticisms are: -Breakfast - the freshly squeezed OJ at 5TL is DIVINE and a delight - but though lots of dried fruits/ yoghurt/ bread is available at breakfast, it just didn't seem enough/ appetising. -There was a young woman at the desk when we checked out after 5 days (on 09/04/12) and it's a small thing, but after a wonderful break, she really left a bad taste in my mouth. She was rude and unfriendly and neither thanked us for payment nor our stay, nor did she bid us goodbye as we left. She was also quite rude to one of the other workers in our presence. It's a shame we had to deal with her as everyone else was lovely. Just to note - there are outlets in the room which accept a variety of plugs and there is also a mini-fridge. No kettle and no iron - but sending out laundry was fast and affordable. Living room area also very nice to hang out in and there is a laptop on hand if you need to use it.

My wife and I first came here on our first trip to Istanbul - we wanted to be within easy walking distance from the classic sights and sites, partcularly near the Blue Mosque, but hadn't really anticipated just how close we'd be. Rooms aren't massive but are a decent size, individually decorated and matching the ambience of confident, professional quality but with a laid-back air. Arriving at night-time via their uber-efficient airport pick-up, the (fluent English) staff settled us in and recommend we whisk straight up to the hotel roof terrace: what a view of the Blue Mosque and the Golden Horn! Truly amazing. Moving over the river to Taksim/Pera is easy - we used the tram stop by the cisterns (which alongside the Archeological Museum is an essential place to visit after the massive big two) and found the immediate area safe and easy to get around. The immediate area isn't as brilliantly easy for prams and older/less mobile visitors, but the hotel is fully accessible via ramps and a small lift. The hotel also has a cool seating/chilling area downstairs with a great diverse library, plus (free) internet access open for guests downstairs. Breakfast! An amazing array of buffet and made-to-order local goods, just thinking about makes me want to go back... no restaurant but the staff were clued-up and recommended brilliant locally-run places both nearby and over the other European side.

The location of this hotel is steps from the Hippodrome and Blue Mosque, next door to the wonderful Islamic Arts Museum. The hotel itself is charming - two small lobby seating areas, each with fireplace, a large guest table and a laptop for guest use is adjacent to one. The breakfast was a large spread of breads, yogurt with many toppings, hard boiled egg, fresh veg, fruit, and olives, along with an array of cheeses. There were also a couple of cereal choices. Our room, 406, was a \"deluxe\" room, and we found it to be a nice size. The beds are quite low to the ground, and also very firm, but I think this suits most backs - it did mine! The bathroom was well-appointed, with a blow-dryer and large tub with a lovely rain shower head. There is a mildew issue around the bath, as the exhaust fan is located at the other end of a long narrow room. The fan was quite loud, and we appreciated this as it could provide white noise if left on. The noise from the school next door was definitely loud - I suppose happy schoolchildren at 7:15 a.m. would be a bother if you wanted to sleep in...perhaps the other side of the building is quieter. This room was on the top floor, and because it was snowy the terrace upstairs was not in use. On one occasion we quite clearly heard people above us, and I wonder how quiet this room would be at other times of the year. The layout of the room itself provided a small sitting nook with a loveseat and chair, adjacent to the tiny balcony, which overlooks the Bosphorous. A nice flat screen tv swivels so that it can be watched from the seating area or from the bed. There is a large closet - this was one of my favorite parts of the room! There was space for two large suitcases to remain open, plenty of shelves and hanging space as well as coat hooks on the wall. The safe was large enough to hold our laptop, ipad and SLR camera with a long lens on it. There was a small fridge set up as a mini-bar, with complimentary water each day, as well as beer, soda and chocolate for purchase. There was door space there where we stored our extra water bottles. Other thoughtful touches included two pairs of disposable slippers, wine glasses and corkscrew. The staff at the hotel were all really helpful and nice. Everyone spoke excellent English, and they provide very useful maps and information - even slips with directions back to the hotel in Turkish in case you need a taxi when you are out. The hotel had been recommended to us by a Turkish colleague, and the recommendation was spot-on.

Common areas had comfy seating and fireplaces, although we didn't use them too often.

Our first room (the standard room) was really way too small (although it was nicely updated, with comfy bed, modern bathroom fixtures etc). So we ended up upgrading to a larger room, and were very happy we did. The staff and service were really great. The front desk was very helpful in acquainting us with the neighborhood and addressing any concerns. It was especially nice to order tea up on the terrace. Breakfast was nothing special- some breads, cheeses, etc. I would recommend asking for the freshly squeezed orange juice (although they charge an extra 5 Lira, its worth it- its a very large glass). The location is just a few steps from the Blue Mosque, and within easy walking distance to Hagia Sofia, Topkapi, and other sites in Sultanahmet. This was ideal for us, since we wanted to see all those sites but were limited in time. Note that the Sultanahmet area is not a \"happening\" area (it's quiet at night, although not in a creepy/shady way). If you are looking for more nightlife, Taksim might be a better option. We went to Taksim on two nights.

Overall assessment is that Ibrahim Pasha Hotel is good: we had a positive experience.

However, the room was warm, as it needed to be: the weather was vile - cold, windy and wet. In the room was a wall mounted docking station for iPod or iPhone which also had FM radio and CD player. Some good Istanbul photobooks and some ethnic Turkish music CDs. A big plus: Jordi Savall's famous 'Istanbul' music CD. Ara G\u00c3\u00bcler's 'Istanbul' photo book. The hotel is tastefully and pleasantly decorated. A good supply of books in the library. A couple of roaring log fires on the ground floor. Complimentary tea and coffee served to guests at all times. A laptop computer available for guest use in the library area. WiFi throughout the hotel but speed was slow and could not download video or send Facebook messages well, I found. There was only one fail: the room safe would not lock. The staff attempted to fix it but failed. After further prompting it was fixed a couple of days into the stay. An inconvenience but only a minor one. Recommend Balik Sabahattin fish restaurant a 10 minute walk away. Excellent mezzes. So good we dined there twice. Close to very efficient, reliable and frequent tram - which crosses Galata Bridge to downtown area - stops nearby to the hotel making most things in the city within easy reach without having to resort to taxis and face traffic jams.

We stayed for 4 nights/3 days. I will start with everything we really appreciated and deserves a 'excellent'. The map they provide is really helpfull. Good description of neighbourhoods, walks to do... We trusted on the 2 day trips (that you can also find on the website) and weren't dissapointed. On the second day we changed the Galata Tower for a walk downhill through Cihangir, Cukurcuma to Tophane, which shows the upcoming neighbourhoods of Istanbul. We followed their restaurant suggestion Balikci Sabahattin and loved it. Simple food, good wine and less rushed through the meal then in other restaurants. We loved breakfast in the hotel and certainly the fresh orange juice which is freshly made as you are waiting for it. As we arrived back rather late each afternoon we didn't really got to appreciate the roof-terrace but the times we just stayed up for a couple of minutes were great. The ultimate plus is the location on 100 meter of the Blue Mosque in a clean and quite location. So why rate 'Average'? The room we had on the third floor was really small. We always do appreciate if we can put our clothes in a closet when staying for more than one day. This is impossible as there is no closet, just because there is no room for it (there is a rack with space for two suitecases). The morning after the first night we asked if it was possible to have an upgrade as their own site was showing availability. The person at the desk was clearly not amused. After a while she gave us the key of the available superior room and said that we could check it out, without any further detail. We saw that the room (on the back) was bigger with more windows and with a couch (no chance of a real closet neither), so said ok to it. What a mistake. What she did not tell us was that the room was adjacent the neighboring schoolyard with even the steps of the school next to the room. So wake up call very early. The morning after we re-complained and happily could return to our prior room. What a relieve. From then on we slept well. Good to know is that prayer in the Blue Mosque is around 5u30 at night but that it's only put through the megaphones for a couple of minutes. We got used to it, but if your a light sleeper... In the evening after changing again we found a bottle of wine in our room and in the end got some compensation so for us this dealt with the problem. Perhaps it was down to just a bad day of the person at the desk as she also was very blunt to someone at breakfast asking for the weather. The response was, I don't know for today but yesterday it was rainy and 12 degrees. Yes it rained for let's say 20 minutes and it was somewhat cooler than the days before, but these directions made the person doubt his clothing which was more than ok for the day ahead. Luckily there was another guest to set the perspective straight. I would recommend the hotel if you get a good deal and are sure about the room surface and position (front). If you never had a hammam experience I recommend Cakaloglu Hammam with the full treatment (with soap massage) for 60 euro.

Our room was very comfortable and quiet. Well, I don't think you're going to miss the call to prayer anywhere in town, but we enjoyed that experience along with all the others in Turkey. I guess the most striking thing to me was how nice and friendly everyone was in Istanbul. That was not just a facade to court tourists, they were really genuine. I often saw the locals helping each other just out of a kind heart. I always felt safe walking around. People seem busy with their daily activities. There were lots of cats around town. One had taken up residence outside a hotel where the doorman had placed his sweater for a bed, next to a dish of milk. One cool morning, I noticed that the doorman had partly covered the curled up cat to keep him warm.

However, I feel this hotel is at risk of losing it's edge by charging an extremely inflated price for a room that is so cramped that you cannot turn round in the shower nor comfortably walk down each side of the bed. We paid 175 euro per night which was top whack given the season. But just felt that no amount of charm could account for this price given the teeny tiny size. It really took the shine off an otherwise lovely experience. We would still highly recommend Ibrahim Pasha to all who travel to Istanbul, but would not recommend you book a standard room unless you get a good deal....and do not suffer from claustrophobia!", "Date": "February 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cWonderful - relaxing and thoroughly recommended\u201d", "Author": "TimLondon65", "ReviewID": "UR94303640", "Content": "Took my other half away for her birthday - long weekend and our first visit to Istanbul.

We had very good communication from the hotel in advance of our trip, and this set the tone when we arrived. We were greeted with a glass of sherbert and useful advice about the city. We knew from earlier reviews that the rooms were on the small side but opted for the standard size anyway, and this proved to be absolutely fine for our purposes. The view out on to the street and the large windows gave a sense of light and space and the call to prayer drifting in reminded us of our location in the heart of the old city despite the modern amenities. The bathroom was small, but had a fantastic shower. The hotel has an excellent location, close to the tramline (really efficient and easy to use) and near the main historic sites such as the Basilica Cistern, Blue Mosque and Aya Sofia. The hotel reccommend restaurants nearby and will make bookings and call taxis for you, although we preferred to choose for ourselves. The restaurants nearby are very geared to the tourist trade and we found a bit of wandering in other neighbourhoods was beneficial. The breakfast is excellent, although the same every day there is plenty of choice. The only thing I would add is that they do charge for orange juice... a little picky of me, but I think this should be included. Everything we asked of the staff was done quickly and with kind words. The staff are generally young-ish and laid back and give a sense that they belong or live in the hotel and aren't just there for their shift. This makes for a really nice atmosphere. We spent a few early evenings before dinner sitting in front of the fire in the lobby with a book and a glass of wine, chatting with fellow guests and staff and playing with the lolloping labrador Godot. It felt really lovely 'coming home' to the hotel if we'd had a long day of walking, getting lost in the Bazaar or hopping between bars and restaurants in Beyoglu.

I highly recommend it here. The decor is tasteful and sophisticated, the whole place had a highly personal touch, not like styaing at the big chains. The guests staying here is also gave off a good vibe, sophisticated travelers-type. In our early 30s we were on the young side. The location is almost unbeatable, so close to Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque, and the museum. Safe location. The rooftop view is unbeatable. You feel at ease here, they recognize your face when you enter. Airport transport service went fine and was reassuring. The driver didn't speak English so the entire ride was silent. FYI- if you stay at their standard room (139 Euros), it's very small, less than 200 sq feet. A queen/king bed barely fits in the room so I would not recommend for people who want space. It's the smallest hotel room I've ever stayed at, in among at least 75 hotels I've visited worldwide. But the fact that I would still recommend this hotel to friends says a lot about how good the ambience and the staff were there. Proximity to the Blue Mosque with 6 minarets blasting out morning prayer around 5am means that you will wake up in the morning due to the noise. Among their restaurant recommendations-Brikili (sp?), where you get a set menu with wine for 95 TL, was superb, so was Hamdi (kebab).

I've found I agree with the six or seven reviews I'd read here: that the rooftop terrace was magnificent, especially at dusk when you could watch the moon rise over the Blue Mosque, but that it's also true that it offers no shade and so would be too hot to spend much time on it in the middle of the day. You can walk to Hagia Sophia, Topkapi, and of course the Blue Mosque; the kapilicarsa (covered market) is a short tram ride away. The breakfast was really superb; most places offer tomatoes, olives, feta, bread, jam, and coffee or tea and fruit; this was the only place we visited that also offered delicious Turkish borek (a savory pastry not unlike the Greek spanikopita), home-made by one of the workers wives! Oh, it was fabulous. I'm still dreaming of those borek! The very best thing was the service. The management and the workers all bent over backwards to help us, and we sincerely appreciate them for that. Very professional, very nice. They proactively provide maps, advice for getting around, warned us about taxi drivers who might take the long way to to hotel and called taxis for us from the hotel to help ensure that it didn't happen (and indeed, when we hailed a cab from our destination to the hotel it was a lot more). In the interest of giving a complete and fair review to other travellers, however, I do have to admit that certain things did come up during our stay that might upset the average traveller. The wireless connection did not work from our room the entire time of our stay. It did work in the lounge area, however, where there is also a computer available for guest use. The hotel management did have calls out to their service provider and were trying to work on this, which we appreciated. It didn't affect us because I wasn't planning to be on the computer, but under different circumstances, the lack of service (when we had counted on it) would have been disastrous. We stayed in two rooms, one at the beginning of a multi-city trip and one at the end. It is true that the \"standard\" room at the beginning of the trip is a little small as others have said. However, we found it so well designed (i.e. with built-in luggage racks that slide out like drawers) and so pretty that we didn't mind the small size. The only real problem is that the bathroom did have a tile over the drain, as described in another trip advisor review. It is also true that there was some visible mildew in the shower tile. The biggest problem was with the second room, which was amazingly beautiful but somewhat disfunctional. The blinds fell down twice--and we were very gentle with them. It's true that the private terrace did not look out onto anything but another building, but we didn't mind--it was just nice to have a little outdoor area to go. The real problem was again the bathroom: any time you took a shower, which was in a tub, the bathroom would flood with water. Specifically what would happen is that there is a ledge between the tub and a window, that looks out onto the room (you can close the blinds for privacy, but it actually is a very cool effect for couples) There is no drain on that ledge, so the water hits the ledge and has nowhere to go, and so it ends up on the floor and floods. When I say \"flood\" I mean: four huge beach-sized towels can't mop it up. There is a slight decline in the flooring so that the water eventually ends up near the toilet, which does have a drain in the floor. But it was uncomfortable and yucky wading through water after every shower, and after reporting the problem to management we were told it was a design flaw and nothing could really be done. That said, my husband said that that room was his favorite of all the places we stayed; it certainly was very hip and cool. We found it to be roomy, with a huge walk-in closet that accommodating our (many--too many) pieces of luggage without problem. It was quiet and the bed--built on a slight platform--was comfortable. We would like to go back but if we do, we might inquire about another \"deluxe\" room, or if the design flaw in the bathroom has been fixed.", "Date": "July 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location, very friendly staff, could be home away from home.\u201d", "Author": "TampaHiker", "ReviewID": "UR34312061", "Content": "This hotel is in the heart of the ancient part of Istanbul (Sultanahmet), just 1/2 block from the Hippodrome and one block from the Blue Mosque.

I said at least they should advise guests when they are booking that construction work is in progress, he was not even apologetic and my opinion should not be in position working directly with the public. This was our last day of three and my regret is that we did not leave then but stayed and paid them another 125 euros. I would suggest that prospective guests think seriously about whether they should consider thinking about this hotel. I have stayed many times in various parts of Turkey and in my opinion this has been my only poor and disappointing experience which I have already related to those I know who wish to go Istanbul and now to your readers.

I remember back in the early 1990s, having walked to the Ibrahim Pasha to ck it out. It was one of the first, classy boutique hotels to have opened in the historic area of the city, Sultanhamet. I vowed to stay there one day. Well, I just completed a 5 night stay, along with three friends. We all stayed in different rooms. I was in one of the small rooms for 125 Euros (US$ 175) and later on, one of the suites at 175 Euros (US$ 250). I also had a chance to see the rooms of my friends. Both category of room were tiny, as were the bathrooms, which were identical. The views from the single rooms were of a wall across the narrow street in front of the hotel. Shades had to be drawn most of the time for privacy. The suite had a view of debris-filled rooftops. So much for views! My friends and I all agreed that the breakfast was the best part of our stay. It was copious, with a wide range of pastries, yoghurt, cereals, hard-boiled eggs, breads, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruit and assorted jellies. And, it was available for several hours, in case you wanted to sleep in one day and still have breakfast. Lastly, the front desk staff were not particularly professional. They seemed to be graduate university students, rather than experienced hoteliers. (At these prices, one might expect more \"spit and polish\" from the front desk.) And, almost all the recommendations for restaurants, etc. were the most expensive in town, i.e. \"tourist or local expense account habitues.\" There are many better hotels for the price charged by the Ibrahim Pasha. This hotel is coasting on its reputation and the accolades received when it first opened 13 yrs ago. If the rate were 80 Euros and 100 Euros for the suites, I'd say that would be fair. But not for what they're charging. Avoid this hotel unless you have no concept of value, there are many better value hotels around for the money.", "Date": "September 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cLocation, Location, Location\u201d", "Author": "culverwood", "ReviewID": "UR8044027", "Content": "We had two rooms here a standard for my son which he thought fine and a deluxe room 404, the one with sloping ceilings shown in the photos on their website which is on the top floor with bath and good views.
