The hotel has clean modern-styled decor and although the rooms are relatively small in size, they are clean, stylish, comfortable, and have all the conveniences that you need.

We were booked at the Hotel Curious for 3 Nights, but after our 1st night we had no choice but to check-out. There was construction going on in the building connected to the hotel and the noise in our room was so loud you would have thought the workers were standing next to us. Voices, yelling, hammering, power drills, etc. It was HORRIBLE! When I asked/told the front desk about the noise it seemed as if theyvsimply could care less. Telling me, \"Yes, there is construction going on, there is nothing we can do about it.\" While that may be true, a decent room where sleeping is possible is surely not too much to ask. They even refused to move us to a room without all the construction noise for the duration of our stay. I was shocked by this, especially after reading all the good reviews. The man working the desk, Mateo, was not helpful in the least and refused to take any blame for the hotel renting out this particular room, which was truly unbearable. I am very disappointed with this property, we relocated to the Hotel Turin down the street which was quite nice.

We were very impressed by the hotel, bearing in mind its competitive price. The hotel is in an excellent location - being approx 4 roads down from the Placa De Cantalunya - at the Northern end of the notrious road \"Las Ramblas\". It was a few hundred yards from Liceu metro station which can take you all over Barcelona! There were lots of bars, shops, restaurants, stalls, market, etc within a very short distance of the hotel. We were even given a discount card by the hotel to use in the locality. The hotel staff were very friendly and knowledgeable (especially Matteau) and couldn't do enough for you. The front reception desk was manned 24 hours and the security of the hotel and rooms was good. The rooms themselves were split into 4 different elements - air, water, fire and earth and decorated with this in mind. We stayed in one of the \"water\" rooms. It was basic and compact but was nicely decorated and comfortable and had virtually everything in it which we needed for our stay - en suite shower room, double bed, side cabinets, a clever compact wardrobe/table set, chair, full length mirror, flat screen tv, etc. Our room also had double doors which opened onto a lovely little balcony at the rear of the hotel. This was very refreshing late at night and early morning! We found there was very little noise and this helped us to have a good night's sleep! The only thing that we felt could improve the room was tea/coffee making facilities. Our room was very clean and the cleaners came in each day to clean, change the bedding and change towels. The hotel also had a breakfast room, which was clean and staffed and where you could obtain a full spread of breakfast between 8 and 11 am each day, including cereals, breads, cakes, dairy products, teas/coffees, etc. We would definitely stay at the Hotel Curious again and recommend it to friends.

The first 2 were as expected but overall the service and rooms did not quite live up to expectations. When we arrived, tired and carrying luggage, the lady on reception was in the middle of explaining something to another set of guests. She asked us to wait and we stood waiting for about 15 mins - which is fine and which we're not complaining about: we realise that's how queues work. But then when _we_ had just started to check in, someone without a booking came in to ask about spare beds for the evening. Instead of finishing dealing with us first, the receptionist promptly stopped and proceeded to spend a good 15 minutes discussing hostel options with new arrival. Overall, it took us almost 3/4 hour to check in and we were pretty unimpressed with the welcome. That having been said, the man on reception on the day we checked out was very friendly helpful, so it wasn't all bad on the service front. The room was clean and not as noisy as we had feared given the central location and modern walls. However, it was small (certainly smaller than I have stayed in previously in Madrid or Barcelona in this price range) and the air con unit struggled with the temperature. Also, the bed was a bit thin and it wasn't possible to prevent the shower water from spilling onto the bathroom floor. Finally, as others have mentioned, the storage space is inadequate. The breakfasts were adequate but limited in range.

The room was quiet at night, with effective curtains blocking out the light, ensuring a good quality of sleep.

Our triple room was on top floor with a small balcony- which was a bit of disappointment - as there was no view of La ramblas as I was hoping for. But you can't have low noise and a sight of Ramblas together. Wireless internet signal was solid. Room was clean and compact. It did feel a bit claustrophobic for 3 people, but my comparison is to US hotels. Also, I do not understand why all spain hotels have a small shower curtain extending for 1/3rd the length - resulting in spilling of water on bathroom floor. Key factors which stand out is the cheerful and customer oriented attitude of service staff at reception. You can ask them for whatever problem you have - right from planning an itinerary, questions abt barcelona, suggestions on icecream shops and SIM card shops in vicinity, availability of tickets to La Musica, US style wall plug adapters to availability of sharpener for daughter's pencils made blunt while recording her journal. Breakfast is nice and wholesome. It was nice of them to prepare it for us at 5.30 am on day of our departure. We took a cab from airport to hotel which cost us 33 euros in evening (meter showed 26 and 7 euros were added on ).

So 4 nights. We choose Hotel Curious because of the reviews on Trip Advisor, the reasonable price, and the fantastic location. Upon arrival we were met by Mateo, after taking care of checking in. Mateo pulled out a map of Barcelona and spent 10 to 15 minutes circling points of interest around the city while giving us a small history lesson. Mateo let us know that he and Hotel Curious were there for us, to make our stay safe and enjoyable. He was great! As was all the staff. Breakfast was generous with eggs, yogurt, cheese and meats, prepared fruits, assorted breads and pastries, cereals, coffee, tea, juice and milk. The hotel was spotless, as was our room. Free WIFI, and a computer for our use in the main lounge. Plus a machine that dispensed pop and beer,for a cost. Our room was small, but very efficient, with a balcony overlooking the street. We slept like babies every night. The location was a very quick 1 minute walk to Las Ramblas and into the Barri Gotic neighborhood. There were bakeries and bars and restaurants very close. Unless you want a Antique , Baroque looking hotel, Hotel Curious is very Modern and GREEN. You cannot beat the Service, Price or Location. We loved Barcelona and will be staying at Hotel Curious again.

Very clean, very comfortable, a great value for the money, and a friendly staff. I stayed there at the start of my trip to Barcelona, and wanted to stay there at the end of it as well, but there was a mix-up in the reservations, and the friendly staff found me a room at a sister property close by, which was helpful since it was a busy weekend and the hotels were otherwise booked up. The staff were always helpful and courteous, and had good suggestions for helping me to arrange my day. I spoke either Spanish or English, and their English was fine. What I like most about the hotel is how simple and straightforward everything is, geared towards guest comfort. The room was spotless, and there's a handy area to hang your clothes, as well as a well-marked recycling area for your disposables-- it's nice to have this feature. It's decorated in a tidy, comfortable IKEA style, but the lights are placed in all the right places and the shower is very comfortable. Breakfast is bread, coffee, tea, yogurt, cheese, jam, and ham, and the area is well-maintained. There's also free wireless in the hotel, as well as a little station downstairs. The room I was in was not particularly big, but it was arranged comfortably and I had a little balcony to sit on. It's in a residential street off of LaRambla, which is lively at all hours, so it's nice to get a little quiet time at the hotel. It's just a 2 minute walk from LaRambla, and it's around the corner from the Boqueria, and within walking distance to many shops and theaters. There's also two small grocery stores nearby if you'd like to pick up bottled water, and a good bakery for snacks. The area around the hotel is safe, though I had been warned it gets less nice a few more blocks away from LaRambla, but it is perfectly fine to walk around in the evenings near the hotel. Very handy: it's a quick walk to the Plaza Catalunya, where the airport bus stops. So you can get to the hotel for a couple of Euros by bus, if you want to save taxi fare. It's also very close to the Metro, which is a great way to get around the city. My stay at the Hotel Curious felt like a great way to get in to the city, clean, quiet, comfortable, and well-located.", "Date": "May 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alicante, Spain", "Title": "\u201cThis hotel makes a nonsense of the star system !\u201d", "Author": "HilaryMS", "ReviewID": "UR106805583", "Content": "I was interested to see what a one star hotel was like, as I don't think I have ever stayed in one before!

It was very clean and minimalist in decoration, the beds were comfortable, the bathroom spotless, the breakfast good and the staff excellent. All the rooms have a huge black and white photo filling the wall behind the bed of a Barcelona landmark. As we were busy charging around Barcelona during the daytime and dining out in the many excellent tapas bars and restaurants in the surrounding area at night, we only spent a small time in the hotel, but it is that sort of hotel that caters to the tourist to Barcelona. The bed is there when you want it, the staff are there when you have a question and the breakfast is there when you are hungry - what more do you need? On top of this, this very techy hotel has free Wifi in the bedrooms and a PC for guests use in the reception. The only negative comment I had was that there was sometimes a smell of cigarette smoke in the reception, which I expect came from smokers who were standing outside the hotel having a cigarette.

It is very close to the Rambla, but usually quiet enough to sleep, especially on the upper floors. It was a very short walk to the Barcelona Catedral, as well as many other sights in the Barri Gotic. The huge Boqueria market is behind the hotel and connected by a convenient alley. We enjoyed fresh fruit and snacks there almost every day. There are plenty of bakeries, markets and restaurants nearby. It would be very difficult to starve in Barcelona. Breakfast was very convenient and while the choices were a bit limited, there was always a variety of yogurts, breads, meats, cereals, fruits and hot and cold beverages. The staff was kind enough to allow early breakfast on days when we had to out early to catch a train or get to the airport. The staff was multi-lingual, very friendly and helpful. The free internet access in the lobby was great and almost always available without having to wait very long. We had a double room. The beds were comfortable and while the room was not huge, there was enough space to open our luggage and settle in. Face it, you don't go to Barcelona to spend your time in a hotel room anyhow. The bathroom was nice and clean with good lighting and plenty of hot water. The elevator was small, but we rarely had to wait long for it to arrive. Incidentally, we went out of town for an overnight trip and were able to leave most of our luggage in their secure storage, which was a great convenience. The hotel offers its Curious Card (it's free) and we did find it helpful to get some small discounts at a nearby bakery and the Chocolate shop down the street. The restaurants they listed looked good and attracted good-sized crowds, although we didn't get to any of them. We were really glad that we picked Hotel Curious; a choice heavily influenced by reviews on Trip Advisor. We would like to return to Barcelona in a few years to see some of the sights that were closed or that we just didn't have enough time to visit.

Bathroom with shower only all very clean. We opened the window to the lift shaft for ventalation after using the shower. The door key card also serves all the electrics in the room so you have to slip it in the holder next to the door to use the lights etc. We had a small balconey but the view out to the building site immediatley next door was quite scary! Just a hollow shell held up with scaffolding. You also felt you could shake hands with your neighbours opposite but as it was winter we did'nt go out there! Could have done with drawer storage as hate having clothes on display, but to save space they had 2 drop down table tops plus a long shelf running across the top. Very quiet situation as well considering they are only yards away from the Ramblas which were heaving that time of year! Breakfast good too,typically continental with a good selection of different foods plus good coffee too! The pros was the location as it has everything going for it, the chocolate Granja shops only across the Ramblas in Carrer Petritxol, Museum of modern art minutes the other way, then off the Ramblas themselves hundreds of the small quirky shops that are impossible to find elsewhere. The cons mainly was the hard bed, both our backs ached all the time! Needed another blanket on the bed rather then turning up the air-con, shower flooded the floor around the screen door and the view outside the balconey! Would I go again? Yes!

The room on the first floor overlooking the narrow street was perfect. Amazingly, though only about 200 metres from Las Ramblas, it was quiet throughout our visit. Very comfortable beds and en-suite bathroom - always immaculately cleaned. A short walk turning right brought us to Las Ramblas. Turn right again to stroll down to the Port or left to the Plaza Catalunya. Behind is one of Barcelona's wonderfully colourful markets. Leave the Hotel turning left and crossing the road to find several excellent and inexpensive restaurants. And across Las Ramblas into the maze of narrow streets and alleyways of the Old City. As I was celebrating my 81st birthday, we decided to take Mateo's advice and ride round Barcelona on the top of the tourist bus.

I loved having the large window and balcony and would put my bags out there when in the room for added space. One suggestion I would make to the managament would be to add more blockage to the railing on the balconies for more privacy. They had some fake greenery and I think adding more would def improve the atmosphere as the view is not so good back there... but again, for the price... no complaints. The charming fellow that works days always was so helpful with directions and such...and yes...the metro was so easy to use.

After reading the MANY positive reviews and comments, we decided to book. Mateo was very helpful in coordinating a room for us, and was diligent in sending email communication back and forth. We went to La Merce 2010 (Barcelona's biggest celebration) - so it was very busy. A room was found for us (there are only 30-some rooms). The rooms are BEAUTIFUL, with high ceilings, and an entire wall mural. I found the room size fine, although small, there is a very clever usage of space. There was a balcony, and functional temperature control. DTV has several foreign language channels. It has been recently renovated. Clean, comfortable, and cozy. The location is amazing. Right on Las Ramblas, and 2 blocks from the Liceu metro stop (everything is accessible). No problems with food or entertainment. 1 block from La Boqueria market. Service is the best. There is an INCLUDED continental breakfast, with cereals, yogurt, breads, fresh fruits.... Meats including sausage, spanish ham, cheeses, warm hard-boiled eggs. Beverages all sorts. The staff are knowledgeable, and give excellent suggestions for trips, and touring. Their English is very strong, and very helpful. They will help you with calling, and allow you to print off your boarding passes for free. WIFI is free. Summary: Absolutely the best kept secret place to stay in Barcelona, for multiple reasons: Affordability - best price for quality stay, including breakfast. Location - on Las Ramblas near metro stop. Service - knowledgeable staff, and very approachable. Quality - excellent renovations, (looks more like a 3-4 star). Downsides - nil really. I thought the rooms were cozy, and large enough.

We stayed in a triple room at the front of the hotel on the fourth floor, overlooking the street but although rather small it was kept spotlessly clean and had air conditioning. Ours had a picture of a Gaudi building on the wall. The simple breakfast included in the room rate, while not very exciting (cereals, cheeses, bread, fruit, croissants, tea/coffee and use of a toaster) was adequate before setting off for the day. I think the guy who checked us in has been mentioned before in these reviews as he was extremely helpful, spoke perfect English and gave us maps, pointing out all of the things we might want to see during our stay. As with others we took his advice and were not short of things to see or do. If this place was twice the size and had a bar and a restaurant it would be a 3 or even a 4 star hotel.

Very close to everything, but two blocks away from all the noise. Nice combination. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The gentlemen who checked us in was extremely helpful. He gave us maps and walked us through it, pointing out all of the sights we might want to visit. That evening there was a different man at the desk, and the only disappointment with this establishment came when we asked for a recommendation for dinner. He said there would be very few places open since it was Sunday and recommended a place down by the Columbus statue near the water. I asked if there was something off La Rambla closer to the hotel that we could grab because we were tired. But he again said probably not much choice since it was Sunday, and that my best bet would be to go to the place he recommended. While waiting for my family to come downstairs, I used the free computer in the lobby and found that the TripAdvisor reviews of the place he recommended were horrible. Not just bad, but horrible. So we decided to find a place on our own. We ended up at a Plaza just a block off La Rambla surrounded with restaurants and outdoor seating that was very lively and VERY OPEN. We had a lovely dinner, in a great location. We felt like the gentlemen at the hotel was pushing the \"touristy\" restaurant and perhaps there may have been some sort of referral fee. Why would he have otherwise told us there was nothing open on Sunday near the hotel or just off La Rambla. There were numerous choices OPEN. That was very disappointing ,but our stay was otherwise very nice. I would stay there again.

Metro Line 3/green. 5-6min from Catalunya Metro station - a hub where you can change lines. - 12-15min from Placa de Colon/port. - In Barri G\u00f2tic (technically it's in El Raval), close to Gran Teatre Del Liceu-where Paco de Lucia played when we were there, various arts museums, Cathedral.... - On same street : FresCo - all you can eat and drink for 10E, (good and fresh food), one pastry shop with whole meal, rye and corn breads, a fine chocolate shop. On Las Ramblas : La Boquer\u00eda (Mercat de Sant Josep, with take-away boxes of various ready chopped fresh fruit for 1E), fancy restaurants, popular restaurants, fast food chaines, ice cream shops - one of which, near Placa Catalunya, an italian gelateria, we find to be of best quality ice cream, natural ingredients, with real fruits from all over the world and where we also had a wonderfull thick, bittersweet hot chocolate, shame it's only take away! - El Corte Ingles in Placa Catalunya, the multi-storey building for a superb shopping experience.

Hotel itself is built for efficiency, clean, modern, spartan, looks like new in a historic building, quiet, each floor has its own theme (wallpaper) displayed on the door and room wall.

There are 2 bread toasters. - Comfortable beds-I like the hardness of the matresse, 1 chair, 1 armchair.

Amenities : soap, shower gel, shampoo, hair-drier, make-up mirror, towels-changed every day. Minor issues, not disturbing: - Slow draining in shower/bathtub. - Twin Room is big enough and I wonder why the bedside tables are so small.

The rooms are not soundproof. a) on my second night I could hear a couple arguing LOUDLY in the evening on my floor, in their own room (not in the hall). It went on for at least an hour and the front desk was called by another person on the floor; b) if there are children staying at the hotel, you can hear them - running and screaming in the hall and in the stairwells (while you're in your room) early in the morning; c) people can hear you have loud sex at 3am. I don't care that you're having sex. I care that it's 3am. 2. Realistically, it's a step up from a hostel. It's clean and people are friendly, but don't count on things like an alarm clock or an actual bed (the mattress sits on a metal frame). My bed squeaked every time I moved. Nor should one expect a closet (there's flimsy storage along one wall - shelves / rod with hangers). 3. The bathrooms are tiny but bigger than the ones I've experienced in London (UK). My shower didn't close properly and leaked. Nevertheless, the housekeeping staff cleans everything up by 1pm and you have a clean bathroom with fresh towels. 4. There are no 'do not disturb' signs for when you want to sleep in. 5. the breakfast provided was not my favourite (croissant, savoury rolls, cured meats, cheese, 2 types of cereal, hard boiled eggs some days, coffee from a machine, orange juice and yoghurt), however there are few options available in the vicinity with most places opening at 10, if not later. 6. AMAZING location. Steps from las ramblas, the boqueria, two metro stations and plenty of history. There's a bakery a few doors down, great restaurants near by and the Carrefour express is only a couple of blocks away on las ramblas for simple groceries like water and snacks (I wouldn't recommend the Dia grocery across the street from the hotel, they don't have the best selection) 7. Again, really great, friendly staff. The front desk people spoke english and french so it made my stay easier. Also, the housekeeping/ kitchen staff spoke english.

As soon as we walked through the door we were greeted with a smile, check-in was efficient and the guy on reception was really helpful and gave us loads of information. The whole place from the lobby, to the rooms, bathrooms and dining room is modern, well presented and spotless. It's in a great location on a quieter street just off la Ramblas and about a 5-10 minute walk from where the Aerobus drops off. We got a taxi when we first arrived and the aerobus on the way back and I would say the Aerobus is probably the better, cheaper option. Breakfast was great, continental but a good continetal with tasty meat, bread, jams, yoghurt and warm boiled eggs. There's a computer in the reception that's free to use which is really if you need to use the internet for anything. There's a decent lift that can fit 4 people without their bags. Rooms were'nt massive but they were perfectly comfortable, same with the showerooms (there was no bath). Nice, big, comfy double beds and a welcome change from most other hotels was the heating and air con which worked efficiently and quietly and changed the temperature of the room accurately and quickly. To sum up we really struggled to find any negatives. The only things that might put some people off is that the place is very modern so don't expect anything \"homely\" and it's also not a 4 or 5 star so no one will be there to help you to your room with your bags (unless, of course, you are someone who needs help in which case i'm sure they would oblige). For the price you really would be hard pressed to fing anywhere else half as good as this place and I really wouldn't hesitate to book again next time I go to Barcelona.", "Date": "January 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Location, small jewel near the Ramblas\u201d", "Author": "oliver1971", "ReviewID": "UR51278831", "Content": "1 block from the Ramblas, no noise at night, great price, good restaurants near the hotel, near the local market, manager very helpful, it a must.

The people are advised they can get best rate from booking directly with hotel on the internet. In fact, there is a free internet computer in the lobby for guests which is certainly a very nice feature. The room they do not picture on the internet is the one I was originally assigned upon arrival. The single room is next to the elevator shaft so if you open your drapes your view is the elevator. The recessed ceiling lighting is adequate to make up for not having daylight however. There is a nice breakfast room with good choices: small refrigerated unit holds the yogurt and cream cheese/butter. Fresh pastries are brought in every AM. Rolls and ham and cheese allow for putting together a small sandwich for later lunch. Coffee was good one of the three days. Arrival welcome to hotel includes map of the city and lots of good information and tips in English for those who need that. I appreciated that since I had never been to Barcelona before. If you arrive at airport and take the Autobus for just 4.25 Euro to Placa Catalunya it is a very easy walk to the hotel. The crowds and noise on La Rambla is almost non-stop, so it is nice to be a block away from it. Easy walk to many attractions, but Metro stop Licieu very close as well.", "Date": "May 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxford", "Title": "\u201cFirst trip abroad for Mum in 20 years - excellent hotel\u201d", "Author": "fletcher42", "ReviewID": "UR26859877", "Content": "Three nights in Sunny Barcelona last week.

The reception staff were very helpful and all staff we met were very friendly and willing to help. The hotel is quite basic but is modern, stylish and VERY clean. Our room was quite small - we had requested 3 single beds and so didn't have too much room to spare - but for what we wanted it was adequate. We had a small balcony overlooking the street but we weren't disturbed by noise in the night. The only complaint about noise might be that the walls are quite thin although we weren't disturbed by thisas only had someone next door one of the nights. The room was left spotless every day and although we didn't request it we had clean towels every day.
