The location of this hotel couldn't be better as its a 2 minute walk from Centraal railway station. Check in was efficient and quick but beware the hotel is split between 2 buildings with a bridge link on the 5th floor where you have to change lifts to reach some rooms on the upper floors on the other block. Remember to take the right colour lift! The rooms were small, basic but clean and functional. We had a view over the river and the railway station and noise wasn't intrusive with good soundproofing in the rooms as we were on the 6th floor. Only one slight criticism was the room was very hot and took a combination of open window and rather noisy air con to bring the temperature down to a reasonable level. Breakfast was pricey but pretty good with a large choice of hot and cold items. The hotel also had free wi-fi which was a great bonus.

The rooms are very small, certainly by US standards, and so is the bathroom: if you're waist size 40, don't bother because you'll have difficulty getting in and out of the shower... Judging from the menu choices the restaurant cannot really be called a restaurant, serving the occasional pizza, but then, there are a zillion places in the downtown area where you can have anything from a bargain meal to a fancy expensive dinner. Breakfast (self serving) is certainly OK, with a fair choice of hot and cold dishes, although the precooked fried eggs tend to be a bit dry. A nice perk is the free wifi, and that has a decent speed, too: other European hotels easily charge \u00e2\u201a\u00ac 15! There is no coffee maker in the room and the desk is really tiny.

The hotel is literally a 5 minute walk from Centraal Station and lots of fast food places, bars and tourist attractions, and about a ten minute walk from Dam Square and nicer pubs and restaurants. The breakfast was included in our booking and it was a lot better than I was expecting, there was a good selection of eggs, sausages, beans, toast, breads, cheeses, cold meats, yogurts, cereal, pastries, basically you won't go hungry! Check out was fast, and they let us keep our suitcases in a seperate locked room until we had to get the train to the airport. Another good point was that they sold cold cans of Heineken in a vending machine on every floor which was ideal for taking back to your room, and cheaper than the bar prices!(3 euros).

Room was \u00c2\u00a3120 for a triple for 1 night (it worked out cheaper to book direct via the hotel website rather than through booking.com or laterooms.com). Firstly, getting to the hotel couldn't be easier. Fly into Schipol (Amsterdam) airport, get the train from the airport to Amsterdam central train station, turn right out of the main station entrance and your hotel is about 200 yards away opposite a massive bike stand with literally thousands of bikes. Check-in process was relatively simple, although some people do take a ridiculous amount of time just to sort out getting their room key (French people) and they always seem to be in front of me. The room was pretty much what you'd expect for a cheap triple in a chain hotel, clean, relatively small, but had most things you'd expect from a hotel room. The only 2 things I could pick them up on are: 1) No drink making facilities, although I suppose hotels aren't obliged to provide them. It wasn't even something that crossed my mind until someone pointed it out later in the day, so that goes to show how little it really bothered me, however I can see some people would have an issue with it. 2) I had the fold-down bed by the window which was comfortable enough, but right in the middle of the frame on the right hand edge was a metal catch which obviously is used for when the bed is folded up to keep it on the wall. However I think i probably scraped my leg on it about 5 times over the course of the day. It didn't do much damage however it was more annoyance factor than anything else and again and I would have had a real problem with it if it'd ripped my new jeans. As it was, it didn't, but I'm sure someone more petty than myself would find cause to complain about something like this, regardless of any injury or damage sustained. Hotel facilities are pretty decent, a nice little bar downstairs, machines on each floor for drinks and snacks. Even though the hotel is built above the train lines coming in and out of central station, I couldn't hear much going past and it certainly wasn't loud enough to disturb me. That said we were on the 5th floor so i can't vouch for what its like down on floors 1,2 or 3. Staff were very polite and helpful (even when we came bundling in about 5am... i think).

The central location of this hotel makes it an ideal starting point for exploring vibrant Amsterdam. Public transport (only a few meters away) is simple to use. We took advantage of two 24hr tram tickets (7 Euros each) and used it extensively. Based on our previous experience, we have not hesitation to recommend this hotel to others. One word of advice: if using a taxi to Schiphol Airport, make sure the full fare is being established before leaving the hotel. We required payment by credit card and were quoted 40 Euros for the 20 minute journey (traffic dependent) by reception. The taxi contractor (based in the lobby, not the driver) asked for 60 Euros (for using credit card facilities!). We referred back to the hotel advice. He then offered 50 Euros but we insisted on the original quotation. He was not a happy but finally agreed and we arrived at our destination on time and without further problems.

Rooms are smallish, but adequate with relatively modern furnishings and a good mattress - very important. Servicing was daily, but the floor cleaning was noticeably cursory.

When we arrived we were given a room on the 8th floor meaning you had to change lifts which was not really a problem, I am a very light sleeper and had taken ear plugs with me because i had read on here that the hotel is beside the main central station. The room we were allocated was above the platform , in saying that the windows were double glazed and rooms insulated, so at night there way no noise at all! We had one of the rooms that over looked the platform and there was no one else beside us the other window looked out onto where the cruise liners left the harbour. It was beautiful and the view from the other window was out in front of central station where you could see all the trams and people going around. The room itself was very clean, our bed linen was changed at least three times during out 5 night stay and we were give clean towels every morning, The only think i would say was there was no kettle in the room, which we did think a bit strange, but in saying that the girl at reception gave us one. Coming from Northern Ireland we love out cups of tea and coffee :) The Hotel is very convenient to all of the Citys main entertainment areas, shopping and tourist attractions and is not located in some of the smaller streets around dam square which would be quite noisey at night. Every thing you need is on your door step, Trams, Central Station, Canal Cruises what more could you ask for. We chose the option of not having breakfast but in saying that you do not have to travel to far until you come across a cafe. It was one of the best stays i have ever had.

Now for the downside - our room has to be the smallest I've ever had, even for the continent! We were constantly tripping over cases and each other, and the bathroom was so tiny you banged your elbow each time you moved! The room had a general cheap ambience - thin, hard carpet, bendy, plastic lightshades, tired, grubby woodchip walls. Our bathroom looked nothing like the ones in the photos - more like a men's public toilet - horrid tiles with grey grouting and mould over the shower. No shelf to put toileties and tiny, cheap thin towels. Although it looked clean, it had a grubby, manky feel to it. Definitely more hostel that hotel. However, the beds were comfy ( If narrow!) and the bedding felt clean and fresh. Overall, I would rate it just above an Etap but not even in the league of one of the shabbier Travelodges.

Hygiene: Well, we first changed the room, because the bathroom didn't appear clean to me and my husband. It defiantly didn't look like a 80 Euro a night bathroom. You know, when mold starts to grow, it gets kind of pinkish around the bathroom tiles and in the corners of the shower. Well, this was what we got. We called the reception and moved to a different room. With no problems. The other room was better. The bed cheets were clean. The room was not shining, but it was alright. Service: Was good. Exactly what you expect. Location: The hotel is located directly above the train station. We stayed in the hotel last 2 days of our stay in Amsterdam. Our train departed early, so it was very convenient to get up just an hour earlier before the train departure and walk over to the train station. Besides of that, it is very close to all attractions (walking distance). Noise: If you are concerned about the noise from the train station - don't worry about that, you really don't hear anything. They took care about this problem by installing some special noise protecting windows. Our room was right above the train tracks and it was quite. The disadvantage of these windows is, that you can not open them. Smoking: If you hope to secretly smoke inside, you wont be able to. The entire hotel is a non smoking hotel (no smoking lounge) and as mentioned above, you cant open the windows. But you have an awesome option to smoke in front of the hotel. If you are the lucky SOB who gets a room at the 8th floor, good luck to you! You will first take the first elevator to get down to the 5th floor. From there you walk to the second elevator that takes you to the ground floor. At night, you will need to wait for the receptionist to get the doors open for you. View: If you are in the B TOWER, make sure you get a room with EVEN numbers. These rooms have a beautiful sea view. The rooms with uneven numbers have a horrible view of the opposite hotel tower. The bed: Well, lets say it this way: you neighbors will defiantly know what you are doing if it is not sleeping.There is no way, you can be quite in this bed! It is like in one of these bad movies . And.... it has these little wheels attached to the bed legs Those can be fun too All in all it is a good hotel to stay, but I would have expected a little bit more for the price. Since it is a non smoking hotel, I would have expected a smoking room in the hotel, so you don't need to go outside every time you want to smoke. The bathrooms could be a little bit cleaner and if you are really unlucky - you will have a horrible view out of your window.

If you're Mr Average on holiday you will love this place for its excellent averageness. I stayed in this hotel for nearly 3 months on a project here, 10-13 day stints. I almost went bananas. The bar has a menu with 4 main courses. 4. I suppose they worked out this is the average number of main courses in an average, average hotel. There are plenty of kebab shops and takeaways nearby, but restaurant wise Amsterdams pretty disappointing in my opinion. And I am always a sucker for room service. Only here its \"nearly room service\" where you order it by phone - CHECK - they cook it CHECK - then YOU go and get it - BEEEEEEP. FAIL. This just doesn't work. To get into the lift you have to insert your room card. How the hell can you do that carrying a tray full of food. You have to either balance it circus style in one hand or suffer the indignity of putting your food on the floor in a public area. Nice. On one occaison a member of staff begrudgingly helped me by opening the lift for me. He probably felt as stupid as he looked - why on earth could he not come with me in the lift and put the food in my room. Instead the hotel man stands watching the customer struggling with a tray. Somethings not quite right here is it .....? Breakfast is miserable. There's no other word for it. On the first day I stayed (of some 60-70 days) it was, average. Day 2. Average. Day 3. Getting a bit sick at the site of the teeny sausages and plastic scrambled egg with beans. Day 4. Dreaming of teeny sausages. Wake up in a cold sweat. Day 5. Cannot go near the breakfast room. Never want to again ever, ever. If only it looked like the pictures of the breakfast on the card in the room with smoked salmon and pretty girls. The wifi is expensive, considering its rubbish. One time it went extremely slow for a few days then stopped altogether. I called reception. Rather than say they would investigate, or look into it, or even \"sorry about that sir\" the dopey girl just says \"We'll refund the money\". Oh great. Thats a solution then. In a business hotel, in 2010, with no internet .... One tip - if you a thirsty when you come into reception area, there is a kind of snack bar type set up near the lifts. Except its so busy I frequently just drank a bottle of pepsi or whatever whilst waiting to buy my wifi voucher from reception. If you don't offer to pay they just assume you brought it in.

The rooms were clean, the staff were friendly enough and we got checked in pretty quickly when we arrived. I have to say that even though our room was overlooking the railway station, there wasn't much noise which came as a welcome suprise. Our room though was on one of the top floors so I cannot speak for rooms nearer to ground level. Even though the hotel is centrally located, you still have a bit of a walk before you manage to get to the 'main' attractions such as; Dam Square and Rembrandtplein. I think for the amount of walking we did, we easily notched up at least 8-10 miles over the course of 2 days, which gives you an idea of how big Amsterdam actually is. Also, Amsterdam is quite expensive, as was this hotel but I think this was as cheap as it was going to get in terms of a decent enough hotel for the night. Despite there being no problems with our room or the hotel generally, nothing really stood out for me, hence the 3 star rating I've given it.

When looking into Amsterdam accommodation, it became very obvious to me that, being one of the more expensive European cities, it was going to be tricky to find somewhere decent to stay without breaking the bank. All I ever want is somewhere clean, comfortable, in a good location and good value for my money - and lo and behold, here it is, the Ibis in Amsterdam. The hotel is obviously really easy to find being just about Central Station, 20 minutes on the train, the third stop from Schipol Airport. You come out the station, turn right, walk 3 minutes and there the hotel is. Staying in a hotel near to Central Station ie. something that is always marked on the tourist direction signs and a focal point of the city was, at some points, an absolute godsend - it's very easy to get lost and disoriented in Amsterdam ;) It was also handy that it was near Central for morning coffee/croissant runs or to grab a drink or snacks before heading for your night's slumber. Check-in was welcoming and swift; after reading some of the reviews on here, I was worried about being put in one of the older rooms, however we thankfully got a room on the 8th floor in Tower B. The room itself was spotlessly clean and bright, perfectly functional for a short break in the city. I was amazed that we actually got a double bed, couples who regularly travel will be familiar with two beds pushed together scenario - not comfortable! And it was definitely bigger than a double and super comfortable with clean, fresh, cosy linen - though oddly three pillows? Bathroom, also spotlessly clean and bright, had a good/hot shower. Basin and loo - lots of towels and the usual complimentary little bottles of shampoo etc. The only gripe was that there was only the main light in the bathroom, not good if you need a night time visit to the loo - blinded! Check-out was again swift and friendly and they were happy to store our bags for a few hours while we did some more mooching around the city before our flight home. The hotel does have vending machines on every floor and coffee and snacks available in the lobby but we didn't really need them. There was also breakfast available for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15 each - very expensive so we didn't bother. The other thing to note is that the hotel is located over the train tracks - the rooms have double windows so you can hear train noise when one is open, but they are seriously sound proof when both are shut. Didn't hear a thing and we both slept like babies! Overall, if you're looking for a good value, clean, comfortable hotel in a great location, then book the Ibis. We got a great deal on their website at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac175 for the two of us for two nights; obviously there is cheaper out there but from what I could tell this meant compromising on comfort. This is a chain hotel so if you're looking for a personal, BnB type service, this isn't the place for you. We were quite happy to be left to our own devises... and the telling test, we would stay there again! Amsterdam is an amazing city to mooch around in and enjoy doing nothing - it snowed when we were there, walking around the Canals in the snow was magical! Enjoy!

The first room was terrible, 2 single beds pushed together to make a double, with 2 single blankets (I even fell through the bed in the middle). The bathroom was disgusting, not like a typical ibis with a cubicle shower, the shower was tiled with a manky shower curtain. Also, the room was very small.

This room could not have been better, wooden floors, spacious bathroom (big cubicle shower), and very good view, plasma TV and huge comfy double bed, hairdryer and safe!

It has two towers, with one built over the railway tracks. At the end of the tower built over the railway tracks are a few rooms where the view is of the trains \"disappearing\" below you/the building, this is a neat thing if you like watching railway activity. I had one of these rooms, the number was 686 if I remember well. Others have commented about noise from the railway, I did not hear any significant noise and believe the hotel (or at least the part I was in) is well insulated, however when straining one's ear it is possible to hear some train noise. It is not sufficient to be disturbing to most people I think. The room size is typical Ibis, others have commented saying the rooms were small, I found my room of \"normal Ibis size\" - the size most rooms at modern purpose-built Ibis hotels are. Sufficient space, but yes opening a big suitcase on the floor takes up much of the free floor space in the room. The bed was typical Ibis too - firm and comfortable, the bathroom had a lot of light as is also typical of (newer) Ibis hotels and which is nice. Due to its location most of the city tourist areas can be walked to easily from the hotel, which makes it a good place to stay for a few days in Amsterdam. Another good thing about the location: no need to take a taxi from Schiphol airport, simply take the train at the airport for a few Euros and 15 minutes later or so you arrive at Amsterdam Centraal station and you are just a few minutes walk away from your hotel. The hotel has a restaurant and bar, however which I did not use due to the proximity of so many other restaurants and bars in the nearby streets. There are also snack and drink vending machines in the hotel lobby. Staff at the hotel I found very friendly. One big downside of this hotel is the in-room wireless Internet access: whilst hotels across the world increasingly provide Internet access for free as part of the package (after all it is a necessary utility, not a \"luxury service\"), Accor in most locations seems to go counter to this trend and still charges a fairly outrageous price in my opinion - if I remember well it was EUR 19.95 for 24 hours access. This access was provided through a commercial third party (T-Mobile). So when considering this hotel, remember that the final price is not what you see on the booking: you will probably need to add a significant amount for Internet access. At other hotels including in downtown Amsterdam this is often free, so make sure to compare apples with apples. Overall conclusion: a typical Ibis, clean, efficient and new, at a very central location. However the \"hidden cost\" of added Internet access can make it significantly more expensive than it looks at first sight.", "Date": "September 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brasil", "Title": "\u201cVery good location\u201d", "Author": "sergio_paro", "ReviewID": "UR39496855", "Content": "The hotel is very well located, a 50 m walking from the Central Train Station.

I was given a room on the 9th floor in the back section, but was totally happy. Room was quiet, spotless clean, has everything I need. No complaints at all. Just two warnings that apply to all Ibis hotels: (1) if you don't want breakfast (E10-E15 fee more), even if you're already pre-paid, and even if you'd told them you don't want breakfast, you have to tell them AGAIN at CHECKOUT you haven't had it, because they automatically add it to your bill. It will even print \"Breakfast: YES\" on the checkin card (even if you haven't paid for it and it's not included) because the default is that the customer wants breakfast and will pay for it. So you just have to tell them at checkout that you haven't had it and make sure they're not charging you for it. (2) Ibis hotels charge you for the telephone just for an outside line (even if it's a toll-free 0800 number). So not just for local or long distance calls, but even for normally toll-free \"800\" or \"0800\" numbers, there's a charge for them. Keeping these two things in mind though, I really like the Ibis chain. I was able to get E50 rooms here pre-booking, and was totally happy in all ways with this place.

The Ibis hotel is a 100% non smoking hotel, if you smoke the first time they charge you 50 Euro, the second time they throw you out but they dont tell you any of this when you check in. We were 12 friends traveling together and we had 4 rooms for 3 persons each. We were supposed to stay for 6 days but after the second day we all checked out. At check out they wanted to charge me more than 100 Euros, 50 Euro for smoking in the room and 50 Euro more because they said that the blanket had ashes on it and that they would have to clean them so I guess they dont usually wash their sheets and the real penalty for smoking in your room would be 100 Euro really. I would strongly recommend to stay in better located hotels closer to Dam Square like the NH Krasnapolski were they have a great service or the Swissotel and Golden Tulip which are also very good.

All you want is a room to sleep, but their policy says 12:00 check-in and not a minute earlier. You ask them to see if anything is available. They say, \"no\" and you are told to wait in the lobby (still under construction) and that you will be called if anything opens up. Dozing off as hordes of budget tourists are checked in on an inefficient but industrial basis, you notice that some of them are actually being given rooms before the check in time. You want to ask about this, but you have to queue in a long line. When you finally get to the reception, the unsmiling staff member says \"no availability\".

We turned on the heater - which also just blew out cold air!!!! There is a '15 minute guarantee' meaning that they fix all problems within 15 minutes - that's a joke!! I asked reception to fix the heater - he said NO, I asked for a spare heater, he said NO. I asked what he could do and he said I don't know. Hmmm... I asked for 2 extra duvets, which someone else brought up promptly - nobody ever fixed the heater. Whatever you want from reception will cost you - even a \u00c2\u00a35 travel adaptor costs a 20 euro deposit! Breakfast was ok but quite limited considering the cost - 2 types of cheese, 4 types of meat, the same sausage, scrambled egg and beans every day, 2 types of cereal, 1 type of yoghurt and about a 5 types of bread!

I have stayed there many times (about 20!) and usually go back mainly because of its location: it's beside the terminuses for the tramcars, buses and boats and a very short walk across a bridge to a great shopping street that leads down to the palace. First, the gripes: As a journalist I use my laptop a great deal and they charge \u00e2\u201a\u00ac25 a day which is a ridiculous price and would have come to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac175 for the week. Fortunately, my regular coffee shop has a number of computers with Internet connection and I worked from there every day for about one or two euro per hour. Also, the service in the restaurant at the Ibis is very, very slow, although the food was excellent when it eventually came. Talking about restaurants, I can highly recommend the Silveren Spiegel - a few minutes walk from the hotel - and also The Five Flies (that's the name!) further down the Spuistraat. Both are expensive. The best kept secret in Amsterdam is a restaurant IN the railway station (on platform 2b) and about 2 minutes walk from the Ibis. It's like something out of an Agatha Christie novel, with the waiters dressed in black with white aprons, fine decor in an eastern style (the oak double linenfold panelling around the restaurant is of superb quality), and a large white parrot or cockatoo - sometimes noisy - called Elvis, on the service counter. Don't get too near him as he might be in one of his moods! The food is excellent and very reasonably priced. I can especially recommend the steaks and wiener schnitzels for dinner, while the Dutch stews are the best value for lunch anywhere. I go there every day (it took me about 3 years staying at the Ibis before I found the place in its most unlikely situation) and is another good reason for staying at the hotel. Say \"hello\" to Dino the Libyan waiter from me if you go there. The Ibis Hotel is also handy for the shops in the station, especially the small supermarket, the chemist's, and the stationery shop.

I would recommend it to anyone who plans to spend the majority of their time exploring the city and doesn't need luxury.", "Date": "August 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cBasic but handy\u201d", "Author": "CosmoKramer2", "ReviewID": "UR8513801", "Content": "Stayed in this hotel for one night purely because we arrived by train from the airport and didn't have much time to change and attend a meeting. The hotel itself is almost part of the station. Just exit the main entrance and walk right for a few minutes past the taxi rank. This obviously means train noises can be quite loud inside of the rooms. The rooms are typical Ibis, small / basic but clean. I would not stay here longer than one night though. There is another Ibis hotel in Amsterdam within a 15 minute taxi ride from the station, apparently this hotel is more modern and rooms are slightly bigger.", "Date": "August 27, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Ibis Amsterdam Centre", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d231323-Reviews-Ibis_Amsterdam_Centre-Amsterdam_Noord_Holland.html", "Price": "$157 - $249*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Stationsplein 49, 1012 AB</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Amsterdam</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">1012 AB</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">The Netherlands</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "231323", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/c7/8b/c78b227b35a0bc9610cc4b974b75494e8large.jpg"}}
