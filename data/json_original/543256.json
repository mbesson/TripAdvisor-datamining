{"Reviews": [{"Content": "If you can't say anything nice... This was by far one of the worst stays I have ever had. The property is in a great location for the cafe society of Crows Nest and the North Shore of Sydney, and there's free parking...and that's about all the positives I can come up with. We booked for two nights and ended up only staying for one.On the downside: the rooms are like hot boxes, even in early Spring. The air was so hot and dry, I got a nosebleed. The service was surly at best. The bed was uncomfortable, and the shower was dirty. For a location where you'd think a working internet facility was important, I was shocked that they charged us 15 cents for each minute -- while using my own dial up access number, that I was already being charged for through my ISP.If you're familiar with roadside motels, my best comparison is that this accommodation is like a highway motel -- for around A$150 or more per night. Do yourself a favor; check out accommodations in Artarmon, North Sydney or St. Leonards if you need to stay near here.", "Date": "Sep 26, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR374714559", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "blueflier"}, {"Content": "Surprisingly nice! Stayed here as another popular hotel was not available. This is conveniently located on the main road - Pacific Highway, with easy access to and from the car park on the Pacific Highway.This is not a glitzy hotel, a little old fashioned but very clean and comfortable, has a bath, big room and a desk. High floors mean no noise and it has good views. Bus services to the city are regular and cheap. Near by Crow's Nest has a lovely neighbourhood feel with lots of restaurants and beauty parlours.Nearest train station is St. Leonards - about 12 mins walk. This is a drive or bus ride hotel. It's a 20 - 30 min drive to the airport. There is a swimming pool on the roof (I did not use it unfortunately). I think this hotel suits a couple who are mobile and want an neighbour hood style accomodation. Has dial up internet access. Price is good.", "Date": "Mar 28, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR560300949", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Baby2"}, {"Content": "Not great... hotel is in the northern part of sydney. not much nearby really, and the hotel is VERY basic. rooms are clean, but not really well finished. I stayed there on business, but wouldnt have stayed if i had been with my wife for example, or if i'd been on holiday. sort of like an elderly travel inn, but not quite as nice, frankly. it is cheap though, but given the location and quality you'd expect nothing else.", "Date": "May 11, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR454924083", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Great hotel Very good value, great rooms and excellent views of the harbour. short bus ride to the city, but much cheaper than the city hotels.", "Date": "Nov 29, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR486221318", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d543256-r10008525-Sovereign_Inn_Crows_Nest-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html", "HotelID": "543256", "Price": "$104"}}
