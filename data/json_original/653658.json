{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Think twice before making booking GREETING TO EVERYONE,I always been traveling to Bali, Indonesia often. Stayed at different hotel, villas even the best one in Bali. I was there in June and July 08 and stayed at Villa Diana Bali but the management was horrible. I rent 3 bedroom family villa with my kids and the first week my son saw a snake (black) but then dissapear but then in couple days, I was the one face to face with the snake at the kitchen...oh my God first time in my life I saw a snake in the villa...so, the best thing is the staff at Villa Diana Bali was so amazing...nice...kind...and I cant complaint about it.Its not only that...the room up stair was smelling so bad...like someone dead in the room!!! horrible smell...and also the room down stair there is a mouse!! mouse poop every where on the floor...of course I asked them to clean but then nxt day the poop still there... but they are denied it...I am 200% sure its a mouse!! even my family know it. By the way, I was renting 1 month and half, of course I paid the deposit $2000, in about 2 weeks they asking a full payment!! I honestly doesnt want to give the full payment because I am not sure later on hen I paid full they didnt responsible if I do have really problem in the villa...so far I was so dissapointed...so I did make another $1800 but they always looking for me or my family asking when is the next payment will be pay?? so annoying that I and my family want to have a peacefull holiday and always this kind problem...at the end I cant handle it...so I leave a week before my usual check out...and they still want me to pay full payment!!! Well, for me the Management so horrible..TV channel international u only can choice 1!!! all the private villa or hotel they are have much more channel international!!The room are ok...not to bad but the bathroom windows isnt good if u want to do style your hair or make up or....shower outside pretty good.The staff was so nice...kind...and amazing people...I miss them but I will never comeback again to stay at Villa Diana Bali...as I know I will be there again on September for 1 month...I rather paid little more or cheaper but the management is better.Thanks everyone to read my review...please try to look another villa...Many private villa that the management proffesional and nice people too.Location isnt bad....near shopping at Seminyak or Legian. maybe 10 to 15 min near KUDETARegards,", "Date": "Jul 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR587848866", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "balimour"}, {"Content": "loved the place so so much Villas diana bali ..is so nice..the room, the place, the service, the people there ..absolutely amazing staff...i loved every minute of it so close to the action, shopping area and also the beach ..but yet so calm and quitevilla diana bali the place to go", "Date": "Jun 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR893574012", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "anna1985_8"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608487-d653658-r18448391-Villa_Diana_Bali-Legian_Bali.html", "HotelID": "653658", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
