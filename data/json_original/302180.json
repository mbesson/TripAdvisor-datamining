Thinking it would clear, settled in only to find it got worse through the night and could smell waves of smoke coming in through air conditioning. Had sleepless night and next day requested to be moved to another floor with no smoking. Staff were professional and friendly, however we had to wait most of the day for another room to become available. When it did we inspected it and although it was a downgrade we were happy enough. Through the day though we noticed the toilet wasn't flushing properly and at 4.00am it backed up, crap and all, it started to overflow, and was coming from along the system! On complaining, was attended to promptly but had to request that mess on floor be cleaned up which was done by wiping up with towels, no disinfectant or anything else! But that wasn't to be the end of it, there obviously was something fundamentally wrong with the whole plumbing system on floor 6 as it backed up each day we were there and we noticed plumbers unblocking toilets in nearby rooms, so an overhaul is obviously needed. As well as this there was a musty smell about the air conditioning which I suspect could use an overhaul as well.

Having paid for a Deluxe Suite we were excited by the prospect of a week in the funky room. Doh! The room was nothing like in the photograph. As in, not renovated. Not funky. Not anything. I should have realised at check in that all was not as it seems when the receptionist filled in 21 breakfast vouchers by hand, keeping us waiting while she laboriously hand wrote on each one. When we got to our room, I was so tired, and so didn't want to start an argument after ten hours travelling. But there was no extra bed, in spite of us requesting that. And a distinctly un-funky room. I could go on about the coffee machine that didn't work, or being billed for two coffees that Housekeeping tried to make to test the first coffee machine, but failed, but suffice it to say that it was only after our second day that we found out that our room entitled us to access to the iClub lounge, with complimentary breakfast. And free wifi. If the receptionist had explained this, instead of individually annotating 21 vouchers that we didn't use, the first impression might have been a bit better. My advice is this; this is a tired hotel, out of the way, and if you are planning to pay extra, make sure that you are certain that what you are getting is what you expect. treat the photos on the hotel website as a fantasy that the designers once had, rather than a realistic impression of what you will get.

I've stayed in many hotels in Hong Kong through the years and have mixed reviews on this one. Pros: The staff was very courteous and their English ability was very good. I had no problems communicating with them at all. The price was great for Hong Kong. The room was big and I could fit my whole family of four in the room, each of us having our own bed. The beds are clean and comfortable, not like the super hard beds I've had elsewhere which is normal for Asia. My room had double windows which kept all the noise outside, which was very nice. The location is great to be able to see local Hong Kong culture without a bunch of foreigners running around like myself. It's located in Kowloon City which is a nice area. Cons: The rooms are dated. They said they gave me a non-smoking room although it had 2 ash trays and it smelled like smoke. I can safely say, it was NOT a non-smoking room. The bathroom, under the sink, and parts around the window in the bedroom had mildew which seems to be a common theme among many of the reviews I read before. The fridge barely cooled anything and stunk so we decided not to buy our kids any milk for the morning time to place in it which meant I had to go out every morning to buy some fresh milk. Internet in the room was about $20 USD per 24-hour period which is too expensive and not worth it. You can buy roaming hot spot connections in Hong Kong, which are convenient to use for less than that for a whole month's use. Conclusion?: I'm not sure I'll stay here again. There are much cleaning (referring to the mildew) hotels out there in areas just as far from the tourist places that are newer, same price and in better condition. So I'll probably go back to those. I didn't have a horrible stay but I think I can find better.

Breakfast is impressive, there's American, Indian and Asian food available and its quite good.The's room in itself is good, nice clean bathrooms.

The staff were friendly but not knowledgeable nor very helpful on local tours or the surrounding area. A surprising turn was that just outside the hotel, there is a bus stop for bus 25 - this is about 5 mins ride (HKD$4.90/person) to the nearest Kowloon Tong MTR station. In the vicinity of the hotel, there are many small shops for herbs & good/cheap dim sum eating places - people are very friendly and will go the extra mile to just help you with a direction. The Bar was also very good with they showing all the BPL matches and the lobby is very big for visitors and persons waiting for thier tour guides friends etc. There is wi-fi facility, which was convenient but it is charged with the number of port connections, so if you have two devices you will be charged twice. This hotel is very good, clean and service was great. The hotel was well air-conditioned.

For the next six years I lived within a half-mile. The Regal Oriental had its heyday when it was the hotel nearest to the Hong Kong Airport. Since the Airport moved away in 1997 it has had serious decline. It is now being renovated in anticipation of the opening of the Hong Kong Cruise Terminal to open in 2013, within sight of the hotel. I got a room on the third floor. The windows looks out but is blurred. The room is irregular in shape. There is a circular mirror in the ceiling but not over the bed. Everything works. The bed is soft and comfortable. Lighting is great. For the first time in many years I had to request a power strip for my CPAP. Internet is HK$5/minute in the room. Each guest gets 2 hours of internet use in the lobby. The Airport Bus A22 makes a stop near the Regal Oriental. From the Airport the stop is about 200 meters walk. To catch the A22 to the Airport requires a seven-minute walk, down a tunnel underneath Prince Edward Road, a major thoroughfare. The immediate neighborhood of the Regal Oriental is not upscale. It is full of motorcycle and automobile shops. Above these shops it is residential. As they were directly in the landing path nobody wanted to live in this area. Now that the airport is gone this area should receive some development. I did not try the restaurants in the Regal Oriental but had a discovery. Ever since the Michelin Red Guide gave one star to Tim Ho Wan, a dim sum place with 24 seats, imitations have sprung up. Karful is such a place. It is about 50 meters from the Regal Oriental. It has about 35 seats. You will have to share a table. They will even move you around to accommodate other customers. The dim sum is first rate and freshly prepared. My friend who used to run banquets for major hotels thinks this is a good place. Top price is for siu mai, HK$22. Most items are HK$16 to 18. Tea is HK$2 per head, not the HK$ 8 to 16 at some of the names. Karful is at the Prince Edward Road end of the one-block long Kai Tak Road. The two roads do not intersect.

Why? Well, a short story. I am planning a 2 night stopover in Hong Kong in a couple of weeks time and looking for a good deal, I looked on \"Wotif.com\" for a reasonably priced hotel. It didn't have to be on the Golden Mile - I know HK fairly well. I travel between home ( New Zealand) and Europe twice a year, and fly on Cathay Pacific when practicable. Wotif had a \"mystery deal\" for 725$HK per night for the stay. so I booked. To my dismay, this hotel were offering the same room, for $625, two days later, including shuttle to and from the airport and internet in the room included. I complained to Wotif - the answer - sorry, thats the rate. We have contacted the property and that was the rate on the day you booked\" They contacted the hotel. \"Upgrade\", they enquired. No chance. \"Cancellation? \" No chance. So muggins is paying considerably more, for paying and booking in advance. Not a good start. Ill review the hotel later. Best of luck with that. OK, it's not a fortune ( and to be fair, I was happy with the rate, until it could be got cheaper) oh, and by the way - Wotif are offering it today at $660 - still more than the property's direct price !", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bologna, Italy", "Title": "\u201cnot so good but not so bad.\u201d", "Author": "Luca C", "ReviewID": "UR125645174", "Content": "The hotel is in the high part of Kowloon.

Room: We checked in late, and our room (513) was ready. The room was a bit stuffy, but once I got the A/C cranking, the room was comfortable after a short while. Had to keep the A/C around 20 C as it was unusually humid during our stay. Our room was not as big as it was on the picture, but it was adequate as there is a limited number of hotels in HK that can accommodate a family of four. Transportation: Closest MTR station is at Mong Kok. You can catch a mini bus outside the hotel to Mong Kok & switch to the subway. There's a bus stop outside the hotel, as this is by the old HK airport. Ask the Reception desk for local map. One side have restaurants, shops, banks, etc, the back-side have bus numbers and locations. Safety: We felt safe at this hotel, as HK is a pretty safe place.

Rooms are not big, not really recommend the breakfast package since you can get food anywhere close by the hotel. They have a MacDonald closeby, or DIm Sum restaurant 5 minutes walk away. Also close to supermarkets. Has wireless internet in room. This hotel is straightly for budget travel and for people who know how to move around HK.

The location is poor, as it is near the old airport, which is now out of the way and a definite taxi ride to get to any reasonable shopping areas or tourist attractions and restaurants.

The older doorman was always brilliant and ran to the door to have it opened and even at times got the elevator for us when he noticed me/us coming back. The bar manager was pretty friendly and recommended their lovely Angus burger and had a bit of a chat with me. Even though the cleaning staff woke us up to make the room up at 8am one on morning and can be pretty loud outside your room they were reasonably helpful when i needed an iron and such (and no i can't speak Cantonese). If you love to venture and enjoy some real chinese and thai cuisine you'll find heaps of restaurants to your liking at amazingly low prices so i have no qualms about the location. Taxis are in abundance outside no matter what time of day and minibus that brings you to Kowloon Tong MTR comes frequently as well. Having the gym was a definite plus. The Not so Good The first problem came about when we realized that our upgrade to Club room left us with half the space and 2 single beds for some reason instead of a larger deluxe room with one large bed. The room had a very unique design to it with lots of mirrors but the toilet was clogged up and refused to flush properly so that had to be dealt with and took about 1-2 hours with us sitting up until almost midnight instead of immediately moving us to a different room even though we had informed them about the toilet situation before leaving to dinner. My partner and i had to sleep on separate beds or squeeze on a single bed at times because the female receptionist at the front desk told us that the other rooms were taken up, that all their rooms were the same size and proceeded to show us that we actually had a more expensive room. There was no desk to work at so i had to resort to doing a lego arrangement on top of the adjacent bed with my luggage and laptop. Also there was barely any space to place our luggage so we kept tripping over our own bags. The in-room wifi price is a little on the high side and if you're staying for 5 nights they have a week's package which is cheaper although you have to inform them that you want the package or else you'll just get billed on a daily basis for every 24hr period that you log in (~HKD $180/24hrs). I was nearly billed for stuff which i never saw in my toilet (mouthwash). Receptionist from business centre Overall It's a nice and simple hotel but they need more English speaking staff at the front desk and the level of customer service could be well improved. Definitely should inform guests about their wifi plan for a few days instead of allowing them to use 5 nights of daily usage which costs more than their weekly plan. I'd recommend this hotel more to people who are more adventurous and don't mind not being in the central/TST areas and enjoy local delights.I'll be making a second trip to this hotel (with wifi included in my package thankfully) this month so hopefully it'll be better and will write a second review then. P.S. It's great to see the GM taking initiative in responding to reviewers and i look forward to a better experience the second time around.

Internet is $180 HKD per 24 hour that\u2019s a real rip off even HK central hotels only charge $120 HKD the most. The hotel is not like the photos on their website; it\u2019s all air brushed and shiny when in reality it\u2019s a dump and not 4 stars they claim to be. I say 3 at the most. The room I was checked in had a mouldy smell the furniture and d\u00e9cor looks like its was done back in 1970 and not been up-dated since (that would explain the smell) All in all I would rather pay the extra $200-500 HKD to stay in a more modern and new hotel that\u2019s also centrally located near a MTR.

All the staff I spoke to had a reasonable if not good command of English, so no problems. Reception was fine I had Emailed the Hotel asking for a smoking room, again no problem, exchanged some money and got a good rate, also booked a trip to mainland China, concierge very helpful,also recomended hopital for my knee x ray.

Don't try to use the internet unless you have a deep purse. They charge you by the minute. The upside is, the hotel rate is reasonable in comparison the same class hotel in the tourists trap areas. If you really wish to get the taste of how people live in the real world in HK, you will get the first look and a pleasant surprise in this neighborhood and this is priceless.

Pictures in brochure misleading so beware HongKong firstimers! 1. Check in was cold, there is no hospitality. the simply ask for passport and credit card and send you off. The girls there need to smile or put more staff so she doesnt over work. No offer for help with luggage. Had to ask and landed the $4/piece cost. Stuff that! 2. The room was very small to our liking. We stayed on 3rd floor, very noisy from the traffic despite the double glazing windows. Even at 4am it was really noisy i.e. HK doesnt sleep. Our room overlook the old airport of the unassuming mass land. 3. Our room is an apparent interconnecting room. We notice on the second night we have a neighboring guest. He watched TV till late at a medium vol and snores when he slept. We could hear everything despite the concrete wall. All the noise travelled from the thin door which we had no control. We rang reception for room move and they simply said no room available! - tough. GM you need to have double door with good seals. 4. Room service menu looked very appetizing dont let it fool you. They offer late supper with plenty of choices however the only serve hot dogs, pizza and premade stuff. Due to jet lag we were awake and hungry at 4 am and couldnt eat greasy stuff all we wanted is fruit plate from the menu. Their excuse when we rang: we had emergency meeting this early morning? what sorta emergency that no one can cut simple fruits! 5. You could hear anybody who walk outside your room 6. mouldy bathroom and fault toilet 7. unfriendly concierge. It was raining on Friday. Asked if we can rent umbrella before we finished they abruptly interrupt me with buy only! no rent! guessing he's busy! GM need to look at staffing 8. Key card. Stupid rule that you allowed only 1 key/room. i'm not sure who's bright idea is this! GM you will definitely need to review this! my wife had to accompany me at late night to buy some water!.

Frankly, being a seasoned traveller, I know I should not trust everything on the hotel's website... the clean and spacious room... the modern design.

First, if you think you are going to get one of those rooms that were shown on the website... think again... not unless you are checked into the Executive floor on the third level (OMG! Which hotel has its executive rooms on third floor???). Least did I expect when I asked for a high-floor room what I've got is a themed Chinese decor room. I was shocked! The room resembled a Chinese restaurant in the 1980's. For one moment, I thought I was the star of a chinese porn movie! Having got used to clean and well-design hotel rooms, this really topped the list for being the worst hotel. The furniture was old and worn out. And I had so many issues with the bed! Don't expect a good night sleep if you are sharing the bed. I was woken up whenever my partner made a slight move. The bed is not firm at all! The bathroom is worse. The fixtures are old, tiles are old and worn. The toiletries are not even comparable to that of a 4-star hotel! The towels??? Torn and old. I was told by the receptionist that all the rooms were renovated (since when???). Other than the modern rooms at level 3 (the so called executive floor), the rest of the rooms are themed Chinese or Arabian... hmmm. If you are into kinky rooms, then this Regal Oriental is definitely a good choice for you. The only good thing about the hotel is the gym. Although I didn't use it, I did have a look at it. I must say that the gym is much better than what I've expected. It's small but it has the basic equipments and most importantly, it's clean and modern. The hotel is definitely out of any action. But taxis are easily available. I took a cab to the nearest MTR station (about HK$40) and transferred to the subway whenever I needed to go to Hong Kong island. But if you are looking for action and fun, then this hotel is definitely not your choice. It's too out of the way. On the whole, this hotel is good for the budget conscious crowd.

The room was approx 8 feet in width with 2 single beds squashed up at the end of the room. It had the feel of a room in a university hall of residence. We were there for 2 nights, our room wasn't made up after the first night either. Due to the builders we had to keep the curtains drawn as they were wandering about on the scaffolding outside the window. There are much better hotels to choose from in Hong Kong so my advice is steer clear of this one.", "Date": "June 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbus, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cnice affordable 3 star hotel\u201d", "Author": "tqlagold", "ReviewID": "UR16694725", "Content": "I booked the hotel thru HKHA (Hong Kong Hotel Association) at the airport. They offered a really good rate including airport transfer (to the hotel and to the airport). The bus ride to the hotel from the airpot took only 45 minutes, but going to the airport from the hotel took about 1.5 hours because we stopped at another Regal hotel to pick up more people. But overall, the complimentary airport transfer is great. The location is not so great, it takes one bus ride and MTR rides to get to go tourist attractions (TST, hong kong island, etc). The bus ride is about 15-20 minutes, and MTR takes a second. For 4 days I was there, i bought a HKD150 octopus card, and still have HKD30 left. And I take MTR everywhere (including Tung Chung to go to Big Buddha), I didn't even ride on a taxi at all while I was there. The room is spacious. We actually got a sitting area. The mattress is hard, but I think it's normal in HK. We got a view of the Prince Edward Road from 12th floor. Concierge staff is very helpful, reception staff are friendly. They charge HKD50 for half hour internet use on 3rd floor, not bad. There are a lot of thai and vietnamese restaurants around the corner. The neighborhood seems pretty safe to walk around at night. We were jetlagged, so we walked to 24 hour McDonalds at 4am. The only bad thing is, the hotel doesn't have a pool. I had never stayed at a hotel with no pool. It rained a lot when we were there, and an indoor pool would be great when we're stuck in the hotel.", "Date": "June 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol", "Title": "\u201cgood value (because of the area)\u201d", "Author": "Arthawk", "ReviewID": "UR15752393", "Content": "Located in Kowloon City (not Kowloon Tong), and trade has passed on with airport relocation.

Ok now for no one whom has been to Hong Kong I have stayed at this hotel twice already this year. The hotel is about 15 minutes cab ride from Kowloon Tong Metro station which is about $30 HKD during rush hour. (There is also a massive shopping mall attached to the station) If you wanted to you could always use the public light bus which costs $4.00 HKD either cash or Octopus (equivalent to a Oyster card used on London transport) normally it is bus number 25M when you come out of the hotel and turn left that you would one to catch to Kowloon Tong plus you can\u2019t miss the stop on the 25M as it is the last stop on the bus. Myself and a college was there for business and leisure the area we thought was very safe as we would be out at 3.00 o\u2019clock in the morning. A cab fair from Lan Kwai Fong which is the club district for Hong Kong and which is on Hong Kong Island is about $100 HKD but make sure to state Regal Oriental old airport hotel as they have a tendency to go to the Regal riverside hotel. The hotel for its price is brilliant and I personally thought it was perfect to move around the whole of Hong Kong. The hotel was brilliant you couldn\u2019t go wrong soon as you land at the airport there are direct connections via there hotel shuttle bus to the hotel the shuttle bus also servers Disney Land Hong Kong. The staff at the hotel are brilliant they have are very proficient in English rooms are extremely clean the view is brilliant. The rooms are modern and have a very elegant feeling and we where staying in a deluxe room the bathroom was amazing with a marble effect wash basin shelf with a massive mirror and hair dryer the room we where staying in also was equipped with a mini bar and a safe . I would say after having a look at the business rooms the deluxe is a lot better. There is access to a Wifi internet connection in all the rooms at a charge of $350 HKD for 3 days and about $100 HKD for 24hrs. They have a small business centre as well which offers printing, fax, scanning and photocopying the rates are reasonable. I would recommend this hotel to anyone without hesitation.

The hotel itself looks nice but the rooms, although VERY nice, are very old. May be they are going for the \"retro\" look.

Our trips to Hongkong's tourist destinations would not have been made possible if not for the assistance by the hotel staff. We were able to visit Kowloon Hotel & Holiday Hotel.

The space was quite adequate since there were only 3 of us. We have brought and eaten food inside our rooms and we have never seen any insect crawling. Our room was kept well & tidy by the hotel maids every morning. So by the time we return to the hotel in the evening, it makes it easier for us to lay down immediately and sleep. One flaw of the hotel is their water system. During our entire stay, they were doing some maintenance & repairs to it. It didn't affect us though since we are already gone by the time they cut-off the water. And we have already arrived by the time the water system is being resumed to normal operation.

The room size is alright, not small at all as compared to many other 4-star hotels in HK, however, all the fixtures and fittings are very old that you suspect the hotel has ever done any upgrade since its establishment 2.
