Hotel provide only basic services do not aspect any thingh special for you. You need to carry your luggage by your own to and from the room no bell boys. Rooms don't have ventilation or windows so you will not see outside your room, AC are working fine, They provide Shampoo,Soap, towel and Tea Coffee machine in the room with one jub of water. If you need any crocery other than this they dont provide as they dont have kitchen in the hotel. Breakfast is served in Park Baluchhi Resturant situated on the ground floor with fixed menu Bread Butter, Jam , Puri Aloo Subji, Upma Sambhar, Egg. Tea, Coffee and Juice good for budget travelers but you will get bored eating same breakfast everyday. Rooms are not so hygenic as compared to Singapore standards. Now i want to tell you the basic benifit of the hotel. Its is situated opposite of Mustafa (only 24/7 shopping mall in Singapore) best for Indian Travelers. So many Indian resturants with in 2 mins walking as you are in Little India Area some of them are pure veg also. Taxi Stand, Bus Stand, MRT (Singapore Metro), Hippo Bus Stop only few steps of walking. Niranjan the electronics pradise as every body wants LCD/LED in very near only 3-4 mins walk cheapest electronis stores in Singapore. At the ground floor of the hotel there is a city tour travel agent named Star Tours gives you genunie advise and cheaper city travel deals so you save lot of money i saved more than Rs.15000 as per his advise the guy is really genuine and friendly. Travel Singapore its really nice. there are other hotels in near by like Park Royal, Claremoun also but Fortuna is the cheapest one and have lot of benefit in terms of money. You will save more than 300 SGD of Taxi staying in this hotel or Area in 5 days of travel.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sri Lanka", "Title": "\u201cworst stay ever!\u201d", "Author": "Shenie", "ReviewID": "UR124938335", "Content": "as far as budget hotels go, this is the worst experience I have had so far.

It is located in front of the Indian restaurant Sagar Ratna, not only because of which it has an Indian taste to it. The reason I say this is it has all the features that make it look similar to a 2 or may be 3 star Indian hotel. The Hotel has an in-built restaurant where one can get buffet breakfast and dinner at affordable rates.Well, the breakfast is complementary. There are a lot of Indian dishes in the menu. Also there are lots of restaurants around serving Indian food. After we finalized our trip to Singapore 3 weeks back, this was the hotel we settled for coz of veg food after a deliberate research & reading reviews on Tripadvisor.Then we started looking for a travel company & asked 3-4 for quotations.Finally , We got Antilog Vacations for arranging the tour as they r were suggested by few friends.I must say we got a splendid service & low rates from them.The tour started with a very good note with our tour representative waiting for us at sharp time at airport. The Rooms/bathrooms are clean and comfortable, not very big though, score about 7 on 10 for me. The staff is friendly and courteous. Location is definitely a plus. It\u2019s very well connected with buses, MRT and taxis all around. Mustafa Centre Shopping Mall (24hrs) is just across the street. Mustafa center gives you the best deal in entire Singapore and they accept INR also.Mustafa Center Money Exchange gives you the best rates in Singapore. And you dont need to hire taxi for anything except airport transfers & Sentosa. Don't expect too much since it's only a 3 star hotel but the location is excellent. If you are looking for luxury and time to spend in hotel, this is not the place. But in case you are on a business trip or planning an economy tour for urself or some client, just the right place..

Rude staff - unconcerned - esp since hotel would be full due to heavy summar vacation rush from India & Indonesia region. 2). Otherwise - nobody would stay here at Fortuna. 3). Staff do not help with hand luggage. \"Bell boy\" concept is useless. While guests wait for their rooms to be checked in, reception employees do not allow guests to use the guest wash room on ground floor mentioning it is only for \"staff\". There are no public utilities available at the hotel. 4). From other reviews in Sept '06, we also had same experience of Periplaneta Americana - \"cockroach\" - small cockroaches in bathrooms - plenty & quite few in rooms also. It seems they have'nt done any plumbing repairs since Sept '06, when someone posted similar complaints on TripAdvisor. They only come & spray once - not bothered again. 5). Toaster also is not working properly & cannot have capacity to cater to 50 breakfast requests at a time. They even have not provided 2 more toasters even at peak season...!! 6). TV in the room was w/o remote inspite of reminders & there was no radio as given on website. Visitors - u may have to pay only slightly more, but AVOID Fortuna.

Toasters dont work there. Baths are unclean ; tubs ( if you are lucky to get a rooom with one) are slippery and inferior .If you have a choice avoid this Hotel and yes the staff is rude Shireesh Joshi Pune", "Date": "October 30, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Fortuna Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d306170-Reviews-Fortuna_Hotel-Singapore.html", "Price": "$50 - $118*", "Address": "<div class=\"amenFloat\">", "HotelID": "306170", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/daodao/photo-s/01/8e/26/5f/sp-1.jpg"}}
