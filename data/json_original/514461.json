The staff was horrible, rude is such and understatement!!! These ladies, and they do NOT deserve such a nice word, could not have been nastier or trashier. Bad language and didnt even pay any attention to what they were doing at check in. Waited to check out because there was a problem with the room. Stood at the counter for almost 10 minutes before anybody even came, then the lady came over asked \"checking out?\" took my keys for the room threw them on the counter and walked away.As if this all wasnt bad enough, I check out and they charged my card an additional $120! They claim it is a deposit that will reverse in a few days. This was not stated on the paperwork anywhere!I callled the hotel to try to find out why this additional money was charged to me and the RUDE manager, Sam Patel, actually had the nerve to hang up on me. I left a message for him, waited all day and never received a call back. Then when I do get through to him he has the nerve to hang up on me and refuse to explain the charge.These people are BAD news!!! There are plenty of other hotel choices... go to ANY other hotel in Daytona. They will rip you off and treat you like trash.If all of this is not bad enough, there is a TON of road noise from the traffic; the public bathroom in the loby was filthy, with boxes of tampons all over the shelves, no hand soap and no paper towels. The pool was dirty. There is NO water pressure in the showers, toilets or sink. The a/c didnt work properly. The carpets were dirty.Seriously, stay away from this nightmare!!

If you are looking for a business center, don't stay here. Nothing in their business center worked. This hotel held nearly $400.00 on my debit card for a one night stay. I signed the check in form for a room cost of $59.95 per night. When I checked my account the next morning there were all kinds of charges on my card totaling $286.45. When we checked out, I was presented a bill for $67.45, which was held on my card in addition to the $286.45. After I arrived home, I checked my account again and there were $217.45 in charges. I questioned this and was told it was because we smoked in the room. We had our special needs granddaughter with us. She is not able to tolerate smoke. We had made several trips outside to smoke and were seen doing so. I guess they charge you a fee at this hotel if you smoke at all, even on the outside. I asked how in the world they could say that and was told that the night auditor smelled smoke when he put our bill under the door. Since there was no bill under our door I guess that is the standard lie. THEY WILL NEVER GET ANOTHER DIME FROM ME AND I HOPE THAT ALL SMOKERS WILL BOYCOTT THIS LOCATION. The hotel was nearly empty during this stay which was at the beginning of Speed Weeks 2012 and Presidents day 2012. What a shame. I would rather stay in a dump and be treated fairly than to stay here under these conditions. I will tell you that we left this hotel after only one night and checked into a Clarion Hotel and were more than pleased with the service there.

Got to this one, and checked in with no problems. Staff was friendly. Got to my room, and the door wouldn't open. It started to open, but it was like a chain was hooked on the inside. So I wondered if there was someone inside. So I went and got someone from the front desk to help me out. The guy that came back with me bascially shoved the door \"hard\" to get it open. Every other time I went into the room, I kicked the bottom of the door to get in. An older couple came walking by me the next morning, and saw me kicking the bottom of the door to open it, and they said their door was the same way. Room was clean with a huge king bed. TV was the old CRT model, with limited channels that were fuzzy. No History or Discovery Channel (my favorites!) Got to the shower, and the shower head was plastic. When I tried to adjust it (spray to massage), it started squirting out the side. I then noticed it had a big crack down the side of it. Went to use the computer in the buisness center, and it was very slow. At one point during breakfast the next morning, trash was piled over the top of the trash can located in the breakfast area. The lady suppling the breakfast area was busy. Maybe she was just overwhelmed that morning. A big group of cheerleaders were there, and the breakfast area was packed.
