I phoned the reception 3 times - the first two times the receptionist said he'd contacted the person in the room - but obviously to no avail. When at 2.30am the problem still wasn't resolved and I asked the receptionist to call the police - he managed to find another room for me. I understand this wasn't the hotel's fault - they can hardly choose the guests they have to stay - but as a result I ended up with 3.5 hours sleep. For the rest of the stay there were no other problems. The room itself was really small - even by Paris standards - although nicely decorated. The bathroom had a separate toilet on the other side of the room - apart from being rather inconvenient - it was completely minute - and not - I'd expect - a 'one size fits all'. For the price we paid per night - I'd expect my pyjamas to at least be folded and not screwed up and thrown on the pillow as they were until I commented on this to the reception staff. Also toiletries and towels were not replaced. The location was lovely - really residential but enough restaurants/bars/cafes to have a choice. The area was 'calm' and quiet and the hotel was less than a 3 minute walk to the local RER station. To sum up -although in a nice area - I wouldn't stay at this hotel again out of choice.

Yet another bonus is that there's a laptop in the lounge and, if I interpreted the sign correctly, complementary wireless access (a saving of another 20 Euro a day, in comparison with most of the Paris hotels). One final note - the lack of decent towels mentioned in other reviews.

The hotel is easy to find, with the Periere (line 3) metro stop very near (3 minutes dragging cases once you get off). Once you get inside, the staff are incredibly polite and helpful. One tip is that if you want to practice your french, let them know, otherwise they will switch to embarassingly perfect english. All the waiters in the cafes were fluent, and can spot l'anglais by the fact that we hesitate to read the menu (I asked in the end). The room was cosy, quite adequate in size. It was very clean and well decorated, with a view over a square with Sacre Coeur in the distance. At night it was quiet, and never felt unsafe. Take a moment to review the \"extreme parking\" in the area. The breakfast in the hotel is pleasant, but at 15 euros each a bit steep. Don't expect a full English, as this isn't Yorkshire. Better (and cheaper) can be found at the cafes nearby, or one of the boulangeries. Prices vary wildly, yet most offer a fixed price breakfast of a pastry, coffee and fruit juice. If you want tea and coffee making stuff at the hotel they will provide you with a kettle etc on request. As others have said, it is walking distance from the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs Elysees, but the metro is very easy to use to get to other places too. We bought 20 single tickets from a machine when we arrived. As others have mentioned, the lift is hilarious. If there is room for 4 people in it, they must be leprechauns, but at a pinch it'll do 2 people + bags.
