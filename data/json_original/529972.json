Room was large and convenient to the Roma Termini train station. But it was located at a corner where all the traffic must turn, and as a result there was a lot of road noise at all hours. Easy walk to the Metro. Neighborhood looks dicey at night but it's really not that bad. I walked around late at night on way back from dinner and there were a number of people on the streets, also returning home. Not bad, but you can probably do better for the same money.", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Whitley Bay", "Title": "\u201cNice but remote\u201d", "Author": "ash666", "ReviewID": "UR79735498", "Content": "Elyse 2.5 stars would have been about right, had it been available. It is a 10-15 min walk from Termini, far enough with luggage, and first impressions are not good, very scruffy outside. However, once through the doors it is clean enough inside, though the photos are very flattering and taken quite some time ago. The staff have limited English, but then again you are in Italy, and I found them all very pleasant. The room was very basic, maybe the pitfalls of being a single which always draws the short straw with rooms, and overlooked the rail system which meant it was pretty noisy and no sign of air con but the bathroom was fine even if it was a juggle round the door to get to the toilet. The breakfast was basic rolls/small cakes/juice/tea/coffee but was fine for me though people with a more \u201cAmerican\u201d diet would want more. There was a pleasant courtyard at the back but no sign of a bar. The big problem for me was the location as it was a fair walk to get to anything and there are a lot of hotels of all grades better located and I feel that it is a bit overpriced for what you get.", "Date": "September 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Satun, Thailand", "Title": "\u201cMeh\u201d", "Author": "Sens4life", "ReviewID": "UR71306764", "Content": "Great location, located right next to Roma Termini however the close proximity of so many trains and trams will provide an alarm clock that you can hear and feel starting at 5 in the morning.

The area around the hotel is a bit slumby looking, a lot of small creepy shops and homeless, but the hotel is a little diamond in the rough! The hotel itself is fairly classically decorated, with a warm comfortable family feel to the staff. When my boyfriend and I checked in (speaking no Italian) the girl at the desk gave us a map of Rome, and wrote all over it, showing us the best bus, tram and train routes to get around town, she showed us which attractions were free, which were actually worth going to, even where people our age go out at night, where the cool bars were etc. Unbelievably helpful, we ditched our typical tourist guidebook and stuck to her map, and we got around EVERYWHERE we wanted to and saved a lot of money! We didn't actually see any trouble there, but you wouldn't want to be walking around the area alone at night, but the hotel is mighty conveinent and the staff are lovely.", "Date": "November 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tammisaari", "Title": "\u201cOK for Budget\u201d", "Author": "Pinsteri", "ReviewID": "UR7417731", "Content": "Elyse is an ok hotel for a budget travelling especially when you want your stay to be efficient.

This hotel was not any where in my top 5 choices but everything else was booked. We had several complaints with the first being how loud the traffic was. The hotel is not on a major street so you wouldn't think it would have been a problem but traffic coming in both directions by the train station are forced to turn down the small street. So all you could hear around the clock were buses, cars and motorcylces braking and then accelerating. I tried ear plugs and wrapping a pillow around my head but it did not help. The beds were ridiculously uncomfortable, you could feel every single spring in your back. I resorted to layering extra blankets below the sheets. My only saving grace in getting any sleep was being exhausted from the heat & large amount of walking we did every day. The room & bathroom were at least large but very dingy with carpeting that appeared to be 20 years out, complete with all the stains, quite disgusting. Breakfast was sad compared to all the other hotels we stayed in during our trip. Also, the AC is controlled by the front desk, you have to call to get it adjusted, very strange!", "Date": "July 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brazil", "Title": "\u201cNice budget hotel\u201d", "Author": "Godzila", "ReviewID": "UR5009126", "Content": "I was looking for a good budget hotel for my honeymoon and I chose this hotel based on reviews I read in venere.
