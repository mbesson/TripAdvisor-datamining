I was looking for a large hotel room with a kitchen, sofa and desk. That was literally what I received. First I have never stayed at a hotel in which I must use a room key to activate the elevator. This was simply nuts and confusing. The hotel and rooms are small, very small, extremely small. They say it is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153European\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd styled room, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve traveled Europe extensively and even for their standards this room was small. The couch had two big stains on them. YUCK! But for an added convenience the sofa bed was right next to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Kitchen.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sarcasm. There was no bathroom door, but instead a sliding \u00e2\u20ac\u0153door,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that did not lock and you could hear and see everything that went on in the bathroom. The door was not a solid wooden door, but was a frosted glass door. The sink was outside the bathroom which I was not expecting. The tv was a joke, about the size of a small kitchen tv. The phone was a basic cordless phone. In order to have ice you have to go to the second floor and obtain an ice bucket, as there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t one in the room. Probably for lack of space. The air conditioner did not work properly and kept clicking in the middle of the night. Also, the air conditioning unit was broken. And the ipod dock that is referenced is no dock at all. It is a small radio clock that has a cord that you can plug your ipod or iphone into. Additionally, when I confirmed my reservation I requested a room with a view of the plaza, or the city skyline. Something, anything nice with a view. What I received instead was a crisp clean view of the building next door cement siding. I felt duped to say the least. And when I called down the next morning to request a late check out, (check out is at 12), they stated it was an additional $30 or $35 dollars for each half hour after noon. Also, the room charge when I checked out was different than what appeared on my credit card statement and I am disputing the additional charges. Use an amex when reserving this room as it seems they excessively ask and swipe your card. I have never stayed in a place like this before and trust me will never stay in this place ever again. For what they charged and what you actually receive there are far better spots in NYC to stay.

We chose the hotel based on price and location and were very pleased. We flew JetBlue out of Portland, ME to JFK and took a yellow cab to the hotel. This was our first time with JetBlue and we really enjoyed the airline and would fly it again without hesitation. The check-in process took about 2 minutes and our room was ready early (we arrived around 10:30 a.m.) which we took advantage of for a fee of $35. Staff is very friendly and helpful with directions, advice, etc. The rooms are small but efficient and clean. Beds are comfortable and high speed internet is free. We had a room on the third floor and though others have complained about noise, our room was very quiet and we slept soundly every night. There was no tub in our room, just a shower stall which was fine with us. We tipped housekeeping a few bucks each day and got whatever we requested (extra pillows, towels, etc) and they always left us a thank you note. The location of the hotel is fantastic and the number one reason why we will be returning here on our next visit. It's just across the street from Radio City Music Hall and a short walk from Times Square and Central Park. There are two cafe's within steps from the hotel that serve excellent breakfasts and lunch for very reasonable prices. We ate at Angela's Rock & Roll Deli near Central Park and it was excellent and cheap. Also, Bravo Pizza had the best pizza we've ever had. Virgil's BBQ is also excellent. Planet Hollywood had great Happy Hour specials in the afternoon including delicious $6 cosmos (shout out to bartender Guy who was very friendly and gave great advice about things to do and see). The best meal we had in the city was at Trattoria Trecolori. It is an excellent Italian restaurant with superb, professional staff and amazing food. For $100 we got three courses and two drinks. Excellent. Also worth mentioning: the cupcakes at Magnolia Bakery in Grand Central were SO good! We went to Cirque Du Soleil's Zarkana, Wicked and a Yankees game. All were excellent and well worth the money. We had the New York Pass which we thought was great. We avoided long lines a couple of times and took part in the following tours/attractions: Empire State Building (did this at night; it's not as good as Top of the Rock but probably a must do anyway); Top of the Rock; Circle Line Tours; Madame Tussaud's; Museum of Natural History. These were included in the pass. We figured we saved about $50 each with the pass. We also visited Grand Central ( a must) and Ripley's Believe it or Not (skip it) as well as the Central Park Zoo (skip it). We found New Yorkers to be great people. Friendly, respectful and helpful. We felt safe, even in the subway, and felt totally comfortable walking around the city at any hour. We used Carmel's car service on the way back to the airport and would highly recommend. They were there early, the van was clean and the trip was smooth. The fee was $63 plus tolls and tip. Can't wait for our next trip to NYC!

So the next day we complained and got another room on the sixth floor, however this one was right next to the gym, so anytime anybody would use any of the machines it was quite loud. Luckily nobody used the gym during the night, but they should at least keep it locked during nighttime so to be considerate of other guests on that floor.

The lower concourse of Rockefeller Center has shopping and restaurants, as well as access to a few of the subway lines (D.F.B,M). The Gershwin Theatre is about a 5 minute walk on 51st (about two blocks) and had the show Wicked there. I wished I would have known that before because seeing a show so close to the hotel would have been nice after a long day of sightseeing! Next door is a small restaurant called Theresa's, one side is a pizza place and the other makes sandwiches and coffee. We went there every morning to grab a coffee and chocolate danish and everyone there was friendly and wonderful! There isn't much sitting room, so be prepared to grab your chow and eat as you go. There is also a restaurant at the concourse level of the hotel, which is called Johnny Utah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go because it seemed to serve just bar food and cater to the 21 crowd\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6not our style. Generally, we found the location perfect for getting around and seeing the tourist sights. Now on to the less than happy moments.... When we did our early check in I asked \u00e2\u20ac\u0153please make it a good room because this is our first trip to NYC\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the front desk man said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh yes, this is a good one\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Not quite - on the forth floor, facing the back of another building with a view of offices. The room itself was very small. There was one small chair by the bed, a little desk in one corner and a window in the other that was kind of separated by a large poll. Okay, I can deal with strange layouts, after all I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m there to pretty much shower and sleep. We also had a mini fridge and microwave, which I would guess constituted their idea of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The bath has only a shower, which was fine until I looked up and saw the corners had spider webs and some type of stuff in there too\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.I certainly didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel like cleaning and honestly couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anyway because they give you two body towels, one hand and two face - that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it and nothing more. They were also the hardest towels I have ever scraped across my face and body! The bed was hard, and I mean really hard! So, if you think your going to some fluffy comfy room this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the case. My biggest problem was with the staff on two occasions. 1.) Saturday night we had a fire alarm at 3:00 a.m. and as if that isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough to scare the living daylights out of you, you also couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand what in the world they were saying.! It was this horrible blaring sound followed by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is the Hotel Fire Director mumble mumble mumble\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I really felt for the neighboring rooms because they were foreign and had no idea what was being said either, and it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like I could help. After about an hour it was said by some guests that there was a false alarm, BUT there was no announcement!!!!! I was angry and completely awake\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my last day on my vacation and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to be tired grouchy. Thanks!!!! 2.) We checked our bags with the bell to go enjoy our last day. I was told that when we came back it would take about 10 minutes to retrieve them\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6NOT! We got to the hotel at 4:00 pm., watched countless people get their bags till about 4:30 (I was trying to be patient knowing I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m already irritable). I asked if our bags would be up soon and was told \u00e2\u20ac\u0153yes, they are on their way\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Another woman was waiting and she apparently wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as patient and asked if they were coming from LaGuardia\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.LOL. About 10 minutes more and the same front desk man says in an almost condescending tone to us \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Is there something else I can do for you?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to which I responded \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How about get my bags?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and he pointed to ONE black bag and said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that it?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll cut to the chase\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6he scrambled to figure out by radio where our FOUR bags were, gave us a hotel room key to go to the second floor and help find our bags (really?), which my husband did and we finally left - running all the way to the subway to catch our flight\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.another Thanks Manhattan Centre Hotel!!!! I could pick apart a few other things, but I think this is enough of a ramble! So, to sum this up: 1) Great location and relatively clean. 2.)

An hour later and the Manhattan Centre Hotel ticked the boxes and had good reviews, we booked the next day. We had requested a high room with good views if possible as the trip was to celebrate a birthday but unsure if this would be forwarded to the hotel or indeed acted upon. On arrival at the hotel in a yellow cab from JFK that took 30 mins and cost $45 plus tolls, we checked in at reception which as others have noted is quite small but perfectly adequate. The receptionist was very helpful and checked us in using one of the two check in stations, this provides your room key cards that also provide access to the lifts. We had no issues with the lifts and found them fast and efficient, unlike some other reviewers. In fact it took about 30 seconds to travel from ground to the 25th floor - fast enough for most I think. The hotel room was great, the hotel had received our request and gave us a room on a high floor with good views towards Radio City. The room was clean, modern and spacious enough for two of us on a five night break. There was a flatscreen TV with many channels, tea/coffee making facilities and access to free bottled water on every 'even' floor e.g. 24/26 etc. The bed was very comfortable and temperature control available in the room that worked quite well. No problems with the bathroom and shower, plenty of hot water always available and good pressure too. Again, very clean indeed. The hotel boasts 'The Terrace Club' on the 7th floor which has a bar area, relaxing chairs, restaurant eating area's (inside and out) and three pc's with complimentary internet access - great for using tripadvisor to review restaurants for the nights meal out! The food in The Terrace Club was very good indeed and we enjoyed breakfast in there a couple of times, the staff and service were faultless.

We only live an hour from NYC, so we've never booked a hotel there. This time, however, we wanted to have fun and not worry about the drive home. If you want to be close to Rockefeller Center, and all that it has to offer, there is no better location than the Rockefeller Center Hotel. From the 7th floor Terrace Club you could almost toss a rock and hit The Tree, the skating rink, St. Pat's Cathederal or Radio City Music hall. Like all Club Quarters, the place is very 'efficient'. It's all business, but it's efficient, clean, hospitable and neat. I figure we're going to see the sights, not to hang out in our hotel room. The room rate was about half that of the Hilton, which is a couple of blocks away, though still expensive since we visited after the tree was lit. Johnny Utah's, the restaurant in the basement of the hotel, was great, too. The food was so-so, but the atmosphere was fun, with a mechanical bull in the middle of the place and a packed house after 9:00PM.

This hotel and the Rockefeller Center Guest Quarters are one and the same. Read reviews for both - not sure why Trip Advisor doesn't amend the listing. I had a very nice stay here and for $179 plus taxes, don' t think I could have asked for better. I was there Monday-Wednesday, before Labor Day Weekend- so the very end of the summer season. I had a room on the 16th floor which was very quiet - execpt for the occasional middle of the night horn honking - but I don't think you can avoid that in NYC. My room was spacious, clean and well equipped. The bathroom was nice too, but as it has a sliding frosted glass door that doesn't really offer privacy (or shut tightly), I wouldn't have wanted to share the room with a friend. The location was great. (I wanted to stay in midtown because I was headed to both the Upper West Side and to meet friends in Brooklyn one night for dinner.) Being right on the egde of Rockefeller Center was also quite pleasant and handy. Lots of places to grab a decent breakfats for only a few dollars on your doorstep. There is a tube stop just round the corner next to Radio City Music Hall. (And for any homesick Brits, there is a Pret a Manger just a few blocks west.) This is not the place to stay if you want lots of service, a lobby bar, restaurant, etc. - none of which I was looking for. Not sure why some people complain about the tiny lobby (it is small) but who cares? There are some sofas in it if you need to wait for someone. The only thing on which I would give lower marks was service- and even then most of the people who work the front desk are polite and helpful (not necessarily friendly or welcoming, but polite). There was, however, one man whom I found extremely lacking in any sort of social graces and who does not belong working in a public capacity. I overlooked it but would not want to have to interact with him on a regular basis. It's a discredit to the hotel which seems to be otherwise very well run. I was a bit annoyed that I wasn't allowed to check in even a little early - the place was not full or even busy. I would recommend this hotel to single travellers or maybe a for couple in town for a few days.

The rooms were small - but most of them are in NY, but were vvere very cosy, very modern and clean. The bathroom was again clean and moden but had a shower cubicle and no bath. The lounge, bar and dining area was spacious, quiet and had lovely views out to the Rockefeller Center. It had 3 computers providing free internet access which was very handy. The only downsides to the hotel are that the lobby area is very small and can get crowded and they could do with more than 2 lifts! Be warned though this hotel has no car park!", "Date": "January 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Honolulu", "Title": "\u201cFab time at the Rockefeller Center Hotel\u201d", "Author": "hipchick808", "ReviewID": "UR12397659", "Content": "We stayed at the Rockefeller Center Hotel during the busiest shopping week of the holiday season - 12/2 thru 12/7.

The rooms are on the small side, but the bathroom is exceptionally small. I really didn't like the fact that there was a sliding door to the bathroom that did not meet flush with the wall, leaving an open couple inches gap between door and wall. Our room was clean, though not meticulous by any means. The black furniture highlighted the dust. The bed, however, was heaven and the pillows were exceptional. The day staff were very friendly and helpful. The night staff, not so. So, the hotel is nice, not great, but the location is superb. So much that you want to do is within walking distance. For a better rate, I would stay here again.", "Date": "January 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "HOLLYWOOD", "Title": "\u201cRight Price, Right Location.

Great Start!! They have a great breakfast on thier \"Club\". Price was reasonable. The front desk staff were great, helped me make reservations at restaurants and also booked a helicoptor tour for me and my wife. Only thing i can say i wish they changed were the elevators. Building is between 25 to 30 floors. Yet only 2 elevators? I guess not something can be changed now. But overall the experience in new york was great along with location just made it even more special. Will definetly return and reccommend!

There's no lobby really, so it is pretty much the lift to your room and that's about it - so it really depends what you expect from a hotel. If you just want a modern, clean, comfy room in the centre of Manhattan you will be fine, but don't expect fancy room service or anything like that! There are a couple of pretty affordable places to breakfast at just next to the hotel so don't worry that breakfast isn't included in the price - you can grab something for $5 or less in the cafes nearby. The room was a moderate size for NYC, but the good thing was that it was well designed so you felt you had more space. Good air con system. Modern furnishings and nice flat screen TV. Decent hairdryer and coffee maker provided, they also have vending machines for drinks.", "Date": "November 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tucson, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cGreat NYC Hotel\u201d", "Author": "AZtravelpeople", "ReviewID": "UR10172713", "Content": "My fiancee and I stayed at the Rockefeller Center Hotel for 2 nights in July of 2007. When researching hotels for our trip, we had a few requirements that needed to be met: 1) reasonable rate (didn't want to spend more than $300/night), 2) mid-town location, 3) reasonable overnight parking rates (yes, some people still need to park a car in NYC), 4) exercise facilities and 5) internet access The Rockefeller Center Hotel met all of these requirements. The hotel was clean, modern, and efficient. The rate was very reasonable (our rate was $245/night) . The rooms were small, but nothing out of the usual for NYC. Two years ago we stayed at the Grand Hyatt NYC and I would rate the room quality an the Rockefeller Center Hotel roughly equivalent. The Grand Hyatt's rooms seemed to be a bit larger and it had a giant, fancy lobby (but how much time are you planning on spending in the lobby of your hotel in NYC in the summer?) High speed internet access was included at no additional fee. It has a decent exercise facility. A nice bonus was the free bottled water. If for some reason you have a car you need to park overnight (this doesn't apply to most people), the Rockefeller Center Hotel had an agreement with a garage a couple of blocks away for only $35 a night. Many other hotels we considered were closer to $50/night. Rockefeller Center is a great place to be if you're a tourist. It was fantastic to be able to get up in the morning and walk 2 minutes to watch the live broadcast of the Today Show. When we stayed there, the hotel appeared to be very new -- and as long as it's kept in good shape, we would definitely stay there again.", "Date": "October 20, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Manhattan Centre Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d617306-Reviews-Manhattan_Centre_Hotel-New_York_City_New_York.html", "Price": "$293 - $402*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">25 West 51st Street #B</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New York City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NY</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">10019</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "617306", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/20/04/2004df4a713a7e8f60315dce76eb49781large.jpg"}}
