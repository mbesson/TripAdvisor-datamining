It was our last day and since it had snowed the night before, we wanted to fit in a fast stop at the Blue Mosque before our airport shuttle picked us up- Blue Mosque under the snow, right? Well I made this very clear to the man at the desk and told him we would be returning for the 2:00 shuttle (the airline had arranged the shuttle with the hotel and it was paid for by the airline included in our stay). Well, we arrived back at the hotel by 1:45 and proceeded to wait in the lobby for our shuttle. At 2:10, my boyfriend went to ask the man and reception about our shuttle. His response was they had already come and gone and that we had not been there so he had told them to leave! Firstly we have been very adamant that we were at least 15 minutes early for our personal shuttle, yet the man, who knew very well who were were and what we had been waiting for, didn't tell us one word and had watched us sitting there with our shuttle having already left at his request!! Then he tells us the next shuttle isn't for several hours, meaning we would miss our flight and that we would have to take a taxi, paid for by us, all the way to the airport, which would cost a fortune! I decided to take matters into my own hands, going up to discuss with him myself. I was just barely able to keep my cool as he continued to smile at me in this sinister, fake way, refusing to give me information, and saying OVER and over again it was our fault we missed our shuttle! Then he starts questioning me whether or not my boyfriend and I are married and if it is appropriate for me to be traveling as an unmarried woman, giving me these strange looks and making noises under his breath!!!!!!!!!! Excuse me?! He continued to be totally misogynistic, condescending, and just an insanely annoying person until FINALLY I was able to make him admit that there was another shuttle coming in just a few minutes!!! All of that had been for absolutely nothing- just his sick pleasure of getting me worked up and putting me down for my \"marriage status\"! Wow... You may be wondering I have given them three stars after all of that. Well the room wasn't horrible and I liked the neighborhood. It was snowing and the streets were empty save for some kids throwing snow balls and playing. It was quite atmospheric and felt like a place where people actually live not just a tourist's area. The wait staff in the restaurant were so helpful and pleasant, they really really treated us great and made such an effort for us to enjoy our stay. Just nice, friendly guys all around. I have no idea how often that... man works at the reception desk but Berr Hotel would doing themselves a great disservice in keeping him as the face of their establishment.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cIs it Beer or Berr?\u201d", "Author": "Goldisold", "ReviewID": "UR92804706", "Content": "Bring your own shampoo!!! I was allocated a double room on arrival, fairly large room compared to most pre-fab construction these days. this is a old hotel that requires sprucing, however this should not deter the traveller as the price is reasonable, nice location, walking distance to the metro, continous hot water in room and great housekeeping. If by any chance you enjoy gourmet breakfast, not the place for you. Not your greatest Tulip Inn hotel but overall not bad. Has Istanbul become expensive or am I just tightfisted???

I was there for a total of 3 nights and i got about 8 hours sleep in total. It's situated on a busy road with a lot of traffic, car horns are constant. I changed my room 3 times and the 3rd room was no different but the air-con worked and so i put up with it. The only thing clean in the room was the bedding, the bathroom was falling apart and there were insects in my 3rd room. The breakfast was truly appalling and in my opinion i would rather not eat than eat the crap they had out for you. The staff were unhelpful and even tried selling city maps which said free on them for 6 turkish lira (\u00c2\u00a33). Overall i would strongly recommend you do not stay at this hotel and go somewhere else. I stayed when i was working in Istanbul so it didn't cost me anything but if i were paying i would of demanded a refund and stayed elsewhere. 4**** is a joke, i would say it is pushing 2**.", "Date": "September 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cPleasantly surprised\u201d", "Author": "ArnoldSydney", "ReviewID": "UR20831906", "Content": "We booked this hotel on the word of a relative, and were horrified when later reading the reviews of other travellers. However, we travelled by metro train to the nearest station from the airport (cost negligable), and then walked about 1.5km to the hotel. Check in was no problem, and our room was comfortable, air conditioned, and had a good size bathroom. It is a fair distance to the main attractions, but if you dont mind a walk or short taxi ride, then the value is definitely there. Breakfast is great, a substantial buffet and was included in our fare. It is good value, if you want to be treated like the Sultan, then go and stay somewhere where price and location matches.

I can't make up my mind about the Berr - on the one hand there were things to complain about, but on the other, if I went back to Istanbul I'd probably stay there again. Maybe it's a case of \"better the devil you know\", or the memory of a fantastic tour making me look at the Berr through rose-tinted glasses - who knows? Location: it is about a 20-minute walk from the main attractions - but, what a walk! If you love classy little fashion boutiques (or McDonalds!), you will be in your element. There are also two good supermarkets nearby. Staff: Ranged from one extreme to the other. Some were uber-surly,as others have commented. Yet I spent half an hour talking to one of the reception guys about his trip to England, and he let me use most of his roll of sticky tape to attach stamps to my postcards. (Note to self: take glue on next trip to Turkey - stamps there aren't sticky!) Anyone I asked for directions was always helpful. Cleanliness: Same here. I booked an extra night before the tour, so I had to change rooms. The first room was spotless; in the second we found a boiled sweet and a tissue between the beds. Eeuw! Food: The breakfast room was nice - on the top floor to catch the sun - and a relaxing place to linger. The buffet was varied and generous. One of my better hotel breakfasting experiences. But also one of the weirdest - when I took a helping of what looked like egg mayonnaise with green peppers and paprika. It crunched under the spoon. 'Hmmm', I thought, 'is that crunchy peppers or eggshell?' No, it was worse - it was ice. It hadn't been defrosted! (Although, having a cast iron stomach, I did try some the next day when it was thawed, with no ill effects.) Price: My second room was included in the tour price. I forget what I paid for the extra night pre-tour, but it was quite reasonable. The room was enormous, and the public areas of the Berr are quite posh. I felt like I had been given a free upgrade! So, I guess staying at the Berr can be a very good or a very bad experience, depending on your luck, or who is on duty that day, etc. However, if you stay there on a bad day, I would recommend that you speak to the manager. He seemed quite proactive. We had a problem on the last night, when the doorman sent us to the restaurant across the road - \"very good, very cheap\". Indeed it did look like a homespun place where local bluecollar guys were enjoying the football, but turned out to be the biggest clip joint east of Soho. After a huge argument over the bill, our group paid what we though was reasonable (by London standards, still way over the odds for Istanbul), and crossed back over to the Berr - with an angry waiter in tow. He was soon sent packing by the Berr's manager, once we explained the situation. The manager said we shouldn't have paid anything, but should have gone straight to him, and he would have told us the correct price to pay. When we pointed out that his own employee had sent us there in the first place, he said he couldn't know what his staff were up to if nobody bothered to tell him.

I recently returned back from my honeymoon, a trip to Rome and Istanbul. The trip overall was fantastic. The only negative was Hotel Berr. We booked the hotel with Expedia. We also called three days prior to arriving to ask if our room was still set. Everything was in check apparently. Upon arrival at the check in desk at Hotel Berr, I showed them my confirmation letter from Expedia and asked for my reserved room. Their frontdesk very rudely said that I did not have a room. I showed him my letter and told him that we had called. He said that it did not matter because no rooms were left. I asked him how this was so, and received no answer. He did not even acknowledge the fact that THEY had made the mistake and had given our room away. They had double booked! I asked him to check the computer for our names. He did not even look at his screen, typed in random letters, and said no. I asked them if they could help with an alternative, as most classy hotels would. He said to leave. I asked if I could use their phone. He pointed outside. At this point I realized that we were dealing with the lowest class of hospitality and that we would receive no help from this establishment. We were left to fend for ourselves, in the evening, in a place where we did not speak their language nor did they speak ours. This is the kind of people you will be dealing with if you book with Hotel Berr. Completely dishonest, and lacking any courtesy or hospitality. I am completely disgusted with their treatment and would WARN all other travellers about their establishment. I would not want anyone else to be in the same situation we were in.
