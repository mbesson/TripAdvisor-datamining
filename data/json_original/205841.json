This hotel is in a late 19th century building that has been upgraded but still maintains the style of its past. The wheezy lift that barely makes it to the top of the building is probably the major single addition to the building in recent times. Of course, the stairs are available for those who are energetic\u2026 As I stayed in February when Rome experienced its first major snowfall in 25 years I wasn\u2019t concerned with the air conditioning, but it does exist in the rooms and the heating was effective. The rooms are as large as you\u2019d expect in a major city and include cramped but effective bathrooms. I was lucky and got a room on the 6th floor with a splendid view over the rooftops of Rome. The hotel offers free Wi-Fi throughout the building. However, I was only able to log on to the service and maintain a somewhat reliable Internet connection in the lobby. The reception told me that routers are installed on each floor but also admitted that the age of the building and the thickness of the walls make good wireless connectivity a hit and miss affair. Breakfast in the hotel is good and can set you up for a day\u2019s walking around Rome. More substantial meals can be eaten at the restaurants dotted around the hotel. The Alex restaurant is immediately outside and is OK, but a tad expensive (53 euros for 3 ordinary pasta dishes, 3 coffees, and some tap water). I suspect that better food at a more reasonable price can be found elsewhere. The staff is friendly and helpful. I didn\u2019t see anyone have problems communicating as the folks at reception speak good English. While not being located beside any specific attraction (the Trevi Fountains are a short walk away), the Hotel Alexandra is well positioned to serve as a base to access all the major sights in Rome. A metro station on Line A is 100m away from the front door of the hotel and this can be taken to get to places such as the Central Rail Terminus (two stops), Vatican (four stops), or the Coliseum (four stops, including a transfer to Line B at the Central Rail Terminus). Riding the metro is easy. One-euro tickets allowing rides of up to 75 minutes on metro and bus (enough to get anywhere in Rome) can be bought from automatic vending machines in stations. All in all, the Hotel Alexandra is an excellent place to stay for those who want somewhere interesting in the centre of Rome.", "Date": "February 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cPerfectly ok\u201d", "Author": "Lara888", "ReviewID": "UR124111378", "Content": "Exellent quality-price relation.

We had a double standard room and we paid 90 euro per night with breakfast because I made an early booking and paid all money in advance, I believe the regular price is about 110 euro. We had room 327 which was on the back side of the 3rd floor and had a little balcony. The room size was ok, the room was pretty clean, with TV, a closet, a desk, two chairs and a mini bar. It also had a very good heater (sometimes too hot!). The bathroom was a little small but ok for us, the only problem was the toilet flash which worked just fine but was a little bit noisy (dripping) everytime it was trying to fill up with water. Also the walls were indeed too thin and we could hear almost everything from the room next door.The prices of the drinks, peanuts etc of the mini bar was fine comparing them with the prices in the city of Rome. It had free wi fi but connection was a little difficult, we had to disconnect and reconnect all the time. Finally the entire hotel and the rooms had a weird smell, something like moist. We were very satisfied by the service of the hotel, were all perfect and very helpful with us, provided us with very useful info about the city sights and the metro. Breakfast was pretty good, not very much variety but had the basics. Also it had good filter coffee and you can order espresso too. The location of the hotel is just perfect. Right on via Veneto which is a very beautiful street, too close to Spagna and Fontana di Trevi (5-10 min walk) and you are in walking distance almost from everything. Also the metro stop Barberini which takes you to Vatican in three stops, Spagna, Piazza del Popolo etc is just a few metres from the hotel. Finally one night we had dinner at the Alex cafe-restaurant. The food was great (try the Alex rizotto with shrimps) and the customers of the hotel have a 10% discount. It was quite expensive though, we were 4 persons and we paid for 4 main courses, 1 salad, 2 glasses of wine and 1 coke 100 euro with the discount and after that were still hungry and went for crepes at Fontana di Trevi! Besides the drawbacks my overall experience was good, I believe Hotel Alexandra is a good value for money as all hotels in the centre of Rome are really expensive and not worth the money spent.

We found it to be ideal for first time vistors to Rome. We could walk to all the sights and take a new route everyday and find something new and interesting to see, shop or eat at. Tony at the front desk is very friendly and helpful with recommending local favorite restaurants. If you do decide to take the Leonardo DaVinci train in from the airport to Termini station, I recommend you take a cab from the Termini train station, if you are hauling around luggage. The walk to the metro is very long and full of stairs--which is tiresome to lug your bags up and down after a long flight. The hotel graciously offers a complimentary breakfast. The cafe/espresso and yogurt are fabulous--the rest--yukky! There are cold cereals and pastries, The service at the breakfast is hit or miss--depending upon how busy the dining room is. Forget the hot dishes if you are American, because they are bland, cold, runny and scary. We did find a local restaurant on Via Sistina, a super short walk from the hotel called Ristorante Leon D'Oro. Fabulous homemade pasta and anti-pasta dishes in an intimate setting offering reasonably priced cuisine. Our room was roomy by Rome standards, but not comfortable for relaxing in after a long day of walking & touristing. There were no comfortable sitting chairs/ottomans and the bed is ROCK hard--very European from what we were told. Also, the noise from Via Veneto will remind you of a busy street in New York City. It was hard sometimes to sleep through the night because of the ongoing noise (bring ear plugs if you get a room over this street). For transportation back to Fioucimino Airport I recommend a transport company called www.airportshuttle.it. The most reasonable cost we found for return shuttle transportation to the airport--31Euro for the both of us. I liked the Hotel Alexandra, but knowing what I know now about how much you will walk in Rome and how important it is to have a comfortable, good night sleep to keep pace for the next busy day, I would spend a few more Euro and choose a hotel that has increased comfort/functionality-more American style room--yep I said it, a room with a bit more luxury and in a perfect world a few more English speaking TV channels.

We arrived with 2 other couples, all experienced travelers, all paying the same rate. We all changed rooms at least once after check-in, as the original rooms were so bad (we heard others doing the same). One couple said they eventually got a room that was nice, one said theirs was just barely OK, and they were all absolutely appalled when they saw our room. It looked like an old grandma\u2019s room that hadn\u2019t been updated in many decades - very depressing. It had dingy, stained wallpaper with holes and tears ALL over, bare hardwood floors so deeply worn and rough it was dangerous to walk barefoot, bathroom tile floor chipped up, wood doors & trim paint peeled, chipped, and discolored with age. Furniture was old and dilapidated (some antique, but in need of repair). The shower had a rusty door-frame, the door clumsily replaced by a curtain that fell down when showering. Most unbelievable were the 3 old fashioned (fabric wrapped) electrical chords coming up the wall and hung over the top of headboard, with little switches duck-taped to them - literally hanging over our heads when we laid in bed. And the window opened to a very nice street, but noisy (all night long) beyond anything we have ever experienced. Although warm weather had arrived in Rome, the air conditioners had not been turned on. Shutting the windows meant suffering in a hot room all night. This was our second room. The first was so small that 2 people couldn\u2019t pass each other. It had a double bed with about 2 feet to the wall and to a closet at the foot of the bed. When my husband said \u201cwhere\u2019s the TV?\u201d The bellman said \u201cIt\u2019s in the closet\u201d it was - a little flat screen TV along with an almost empty minibar.

The Hotel Alexandra was an excellent choice for us. As many have noted, the location is great. It is located on a lovely street with easy access to the metro (Barberini). There are many restaurants close by (we had a wonderful dinner at Cafe Alex out front) and it is easy to walk to all the sights (Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, Piazza Navona, Villa Borghese, etc.). The only sights we took the metro to were the ancient center (Colosseum) and Vatican City. The hotel was clean and quiet. We had a room on the 4th Floor overlooking Via Veneto and had no issue with noise from the street. The room was larger than I expected with a huge bathroom. The furnishings were fine (nothing special) and the bed was acceptable (not has hard as other reviews indicated - I had five great nights of sleep). Service at the hotel was solid, albeit reserved. The front desk staff was able to help with directions, make change, etc. The hotel has a elevator which was appreciated after long days sightseeing. The daily breakfast service was good.

I am not a five star hotel naive and i have stayed in many 5 star hotels around Europe. However, a decent 5 star hotel in Rome can cost more than 500 euro per night, which is too much, being on a business trip. So i picked this one hotel and i was pleasantly suprised. It\u00b4s located in Romes prime location, Via Veneto and it\u00b4s close to everything. Staff were polite, despite the stereotypes that Italians are rather rude and snob, and there is even a porter boy (man actually). The hotel has a retro style, and although i am not a fan of this style, it\u00b4s ok. Breakfast is adequate and there is even a big hall, where you can relax. Rooms are adequate, with some amenities that usually you do not find in 3 star hotels. I read some reviews about the size of the room.If you go to Rome and you spend time in your room, apart from sleeping, then you should not go at first place. Rome is such an amazing city and it\u00b4s really pity to discuss about the size of the room. Wrapping up, this is a decent 3 star hotel, which actually feels more like a 4 star hotel.

The hotel was nice and quiet. Room: we had room 505. I marked the room 3 out of 5 because of the beds!! It was very quiet, and large for a European room. About the size of a typical room in a house in the states. The room was only loud if the window was open, but once you shut it, it was quiet. There is a grate right in front of the hotel so as cars drive over it you can hear it. but when the window is closed you can only hear it if you are paying attention to it. The bed was extremely hard. My mom looked underneath the sheets to see if it was just a box spring. Just think of staying at your grandparents house and sleeping on there hard bed, it is WAY worse. I took 4 blankets folded them up and slept on them and it still felt like i was sleeping on the floor. Absolutely the worst bed i have ever laid in by far. The bathroom was a good size, a little over average for a European hotel room. The toilet is really close to the wall. I am an average girl about 175 lbs and my right leg was touching the wall, that's how close it is. The breakfast, is cereal, scrambled eggs, cooked ham, bread rolls, juice, fruit, and cheese. It gets old after the second day. But not that bad. The staff was very friendly and spoke English. Location: GREAT!! it is about a 5 min walk to the Spanish steps and the Trevii Fountain (don't know how to spell it) and 10 mins to the Pantheon. I would say it is about a 20 min walk to ancient Rome. The only place we did not walk to is the Vatican. It was the 4th stop on the metro. The metro is right down the street, about a 30 second walk from the hotel. You cant get a better location for the money!! You can literally walk every ware in the city if you are in decent shape. I have a bad back and i walked the whole city. But wear comfortable shoes! Other: Don't be alarmed to walk at night...there are people all over the place at all hours of the night. But every one starts to come out at about 6pm to the fountain and the Pantheon with ice cream in hand. Be prepared to spend all day at the Vatican. We were there from 9:30am to 5pm and did not see everything. Watch out for people trying to steal your bag or wallet.

We stayed at the Hotel Alexandra for five nights. We had two rooms, a \"deluxe double\" and a \"standard double\". The deluxe double was our room (room #263). While smaller than US standards, it was an excellent size compared to other hotels we have stayed in in Europe. The king size bed was two singles made into one (which did leave a line in the middle, a bit more padding there might have made the difference) and while a litle harder than I like, was adequate after a long day. It was very nicely decorated with a great television, which included satellite tv. The closet had mirrored doors and plenty of room for all of our things. We did have a small balcony which was greatly appreciated because I think now all hotels in Rome are \"non-smoking\" and when I commented upon this at check-in, the front desk attendant was more than accomodating (sympathetic perhaps?), telling me that we could smoke on the balcony \"because we would be outside\" and even brought us an ashtray to keep there. The bathroom was marvelous by European standards (still comparing to other previously stayed in hotels in Europe) with a great bathtub for long soaks after long days and a hand held shower attachment for quick showers in the morning. The pedestal sink had enough room to set things on the side along with a small table with room enough for all our toiletries. Our son's room (329) was a standard double, and while not as roomy as ours, was fine for them. Their bathroom only had a stand up shower and no balcony, but it also had a closet. The breakfast was great with scrambled eggs, bacon, pastries, frest fruit, cereral, all laid out in a very appetizing way and a perfect start to the mornings before setting out on a long day. Great money-saving feature of this hotel. The hotel staff was very nice. They helped us get anywhere we wanted to go with directions, where to get things we needed (our luggage was lost). Anything we asked of them was met with a smile. It was much appreciated. THE BEST PART OF THIS HOTEL is the LOCATION. The Metro stop \"Barberini\" is at the bottom of the small hill the street is on, and the bus stop is right around the corner from that. The Spanish steps and the Tivoli fountain are within walking distance (just ask at the desk, they will point you in the right direction) and all other attractions were either a short Metro trip or bus ride away. I would recommend buying a three day \"all transport\" card to make traveling around very easy. I am a bit of a nosy-nellie, and when we left our room one day the maid was cleaning the room next to ours (262) she allowed me to peek in and look at it. She said it was a room for parents with children. It was larger with a king size bed and a couch which folded out into a bed with a bathroom like ours. If I was staying with little ones, it would be perfect. It did face the front of the hotel with two windows and the maid said it was \"noisier\" but windows close and its a fairly quiet street.

Unlike the pictures on their website, the room was dark, small (but adequate), decorated with very 'busy' and oldfashioned wallpaper that did nothing to add to the size of the room. The television did work, but had a bit missing. All of these we could have lived with. What really caused the problem was the street noise: the room was at the front of the hotel and looked onto the Via Veneto. A busy street at all times of the day and night - and with some kind of metal grid built into it which made a horrendous noise every time a vehicle went over it. Sleep was well nigh impossible. Added to this, hot water appeared to be in short supply - and non-existant in the washbasin! We complained the next morning and asked to be moved to a quieter room. The request was met with some sympathy, but all the quieter rooms were full. To their credit, they did move us to a room at the back of the hotel for the last night of our stay. Not only was the new room quieter, it was also decorated in a much more modern style. If we'd had that room from the start, this would have been a much more positive review. Breakfast was well below average. At 9am (clearly the most popular time) the staff were struggling to cope and the buffet was almost empty. We had to ask every morning for basic items to be replenished. On the positive side, the hotel was spotlessly clean, the beds were comfortable and the staff were generally very polite and helpful. It was close to the Spanish Steps and there were plenty of restaurants within walking distance. We wouldn't stay there again and wouldn't recommend it unless you are guaranteed a room away from the front of the hotel. After all, the main thing you need from a hotel when you're visiting Rome is a good night's sleep so you can cope with the siteseeing!", "Date": "October 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool", "Title": "\u201cWe'll be going back (despite the rain)!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4012921", "Content": "We had a 3 day break and our twin room with double bed was excellent, the bathroom being big enough for a small party on it's own.

The hotel is based on one of the most elegant streets in Rome, packed with resturants and shops etc. The room was quite small but if you are touring and walking all day all you need is somewhere to stay at night. The hotel is 5 minutes walk from the Trevi fountain and the Spanish steps and half an hour to forty minutes from the vatican, definetly worth the walk. Many of the restuarants on the Via Venteto were extremley expensive but if you want to splash out this is the place to go. On the other hand their is a beautiful chinese resturant in one off the side streets beside the Trevi fountain, would defiently reccomend that. The street hotel alexandra is on, is very safe, buses appeared every five minutes and there was an undergrounds 3o feet away.

The scrambled eggs were a bit cool but the bacon was fine. Mind you I did eat early so if you were late in the eggs would have been cold. I ate croissants or rolls with meat. Or cereal with yoghurt. It was all good. I guess if the only thing wrong was the fact that I didnt want to watch CNN or the BBC then I had fun redubbing movies I've seen in English from Italian back to English.
