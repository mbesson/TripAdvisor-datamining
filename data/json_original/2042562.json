We were in town for a concert that evening and were quite tired and in desperate need of a quick nap when we checked into our room. Catching any sleep was an impossibility. Maybe it was the fact that our room was located in a small alcove. Maybe it was because we were near an elevator, or perhaps it was the ice machine outside our door or housekeeping station next to us. Regardless, I think we had the noisiest location in the hotel. We heard every sound as though it were coming from inside our room. Normally when staying in a room like this I'm able to make things work by using the fan as white noise. Having the fan on high didn't help the problem at all. Coming back from our concert around 11 PM, the noise wasn't any better. The last time I looked at the clock it was near 2 AM. I made mention of the noise during checkout and the only suggestion was to request a room away from the ice machine when making future reservations. This is a very good tip for those who are considering a stay at this hotel - something I wish I knew beforehand. It was our only true disappointment. The room itself was stunning, cutting edge and lovely to be in, but the eye candy wears off easily if you cannot rest (which is the purpose of staying in a hotel in the first place.) As for parking, there is a garage adjacent to the hotel, which is what we used. It is less expensive than valet, but there are no in/out privileges, so if you intend to use your car at all, go with the valet service.

We traveled to Chicago from Indianapolis to intercept my daughter who was there on business. All the previous reviews are correct: the hotel is in a great location, the lobby and restaurant areas are interesting to look at, and conducive to hanging out to have a cocktail, the rooms are generously sized (for Chicago), the lap pool and exercise facilities are top-notch,and the in-room amenities are great. We ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant called Filini and the breakfast choices were different and very European: loved it! It was within easy walking distance to Millenium Park, The Art Institute of Chicago, as well as the \"Mile\". I have two negatives about the hotel. The parking garage is poorly marked. We were pretty tired when we came from Indianapolis on Friday night, so that may have been part of it. However, the next day it was just as baffling to maneuver in and out of the garage. It is not a dealbreaker because as the weekend went by, we did get better with the process. We are not easily confused people, but it was slightly annoying to deal with the maze they call a parking garage. The other negative (other reviewers have complained about this too) is the thermostat being right by the hotel window. As a result of this, it is extremely difficult to regulate the temperature in the room. I woke up a couple of times the first night trying to set the thermostat so we wouldn't bake. Neither one of my negatives should stop you from staying here. I would recommend this hotel to anyone I know in Indianapolis considering a stay in CHicago.

I can barely get in unless I push down extremely hard on the handle. Once inside the room, I have to put my entire weight against the door to be able to close it properly and lock it.

Took our two boys downtown for a night in the city. Sometimes when a hotel is hip, the staff can have a 'whatever' attitude - kind of, 'I'm too cool for you....' But not here. The modern vibe of the Radisson is complimented by a welcoming & friendly staff. Our room was on the 10th floor - black onyx/granite floors - with an bright aqua carpet. Excellent lighting, top of the line fixtures. Our room had a balcony, although it was too cold out to enjoy. Wonderful views of Navy Pier and the Lake Michigan. Beds were comfy - 2 queens, rather than 2 double - which is hard to find. One thing we noticed is the doorways to the rooms are not right off the hallway - they are tucked back - you go down a little hallway to the doors to the rooms. This makes the rooms very quiet. No noise from the hallways at all. Being a new hotel, everything is shiny and in excellent condition. The lobby is beautiful, with the long (very long) fireplace and comfy chairs. The lounge, bar and restaurant are modern; decorated in white, gray & silvery tones. We had lunch at Filini - the restaurant. Excellent food. Sandwiches were reasonable (around $10) but the other options were pricey for lunch. ($8-$12 for appy, $16 and up for entree - most averaging $23). Lunch for the four of us was $120 (we did have a couple glasses of wine). Our boys loved the game room (pool table) and 1/2 basketball court. The gym is better equipped than any hotel we have ever stayed.... but it is shared with the residents of the Aqua building. We were there on two occasions, and it wasn't crowded.

The gentleman that checked us in was very nice and professional and explained all the details to us. We were brought up to our room by the door or bellman. The room decor was not our taste. It was very dark and just not our preference so we called the Front Desk after spending a few minutes in the room and were politly offered to move to another room. The new room was much lighter, very clean and we loved it. The lobby is amazing. They have a 50ft long fire place with a loungy area in front which is great to enjoy some drinks at night. The bar seemed busy but we still got served in a timely manner. Server was very friendly as well. However during our stay we did have several issues with room service and the housekeeping service. We ordered breakfast Saturday and were waiting and waiting and waiting. An hour passed, we called and they told us they have not gotten an order from our room! Are you kidding me? They then took our order a second time and promised the food will be up shortly. After we finished breakfast we called to ask housekeeping to clean our room and asked the concierge on our way out for some sightseeing tips. He also gave us some great recommendations for dinner that night. We came back to the hotel after exploring Chicago only to find a dirty room that has not been cleaned yet. We were pretty annoyed by that fact because we were planning on getting ready for dinner. They have a fancy system on their TV's that supposley show you the room service menu and information about the hotel which didn't work as well. For Sunday morning we asked for a wake up call at 8am that we never received as well. I understand that the hotel is brand new and they are still working out the issues but we could have missed our flight if we would not have set our alarm ourselves. Anyway, when we came down to the Front Desk to check out, we met one of the nicest employees ever. Jessica was the manager that morning and she was so understanding and helpful. She offered several solutions and was simply outstanding. We were a little disappointed when we came down to check out but by the time we left we forgot about all the issues due to excellent service from your manager. She is a keeper!

This hotel is fairly new and at the time of this writing, great deals can still be found while this hotel introduces itself to the area. The hotel was very clean, as one would expect in a newer hotel. The hotel itself shares space and some of the amenities with residents who live on the other side of the building and have a separate bank of elevators. The main lobby was spacious and understated with a gas fire feature that runs the length stone accent wall; just the thing after walking around the city on a cold January evening. Across from the lobby is the Hotel Bar and restaurant; again tastefully done with a distinctly Scandinavian accent. Unfortunately, I did not have an opportunity to spend time in the Bar or order from the Hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s menu, but I did attend an event in the hotel during my stay and the food was fantastic. From the Angus Sliders to the gnocchi & ravioli bar, the food was well prepared and flavorful, my compliment to the chefs! The Room was not large, but it was comfortable and the view of Navy Pier was fantastic!. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was what you would expect in a luxury hotel, and combined elements of white porcelain and frosted glass that remained true to the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s theme.

You will see this theme throughout this review. I do a ton of business with my local Radisson in Bothell (Seattle) Washington. I \"won\" two free nights at Blu during a holiday event. I was to receive a park view room on the business class floor. My GPS placed me below the hotel and when I called to get directions on how to get to the surface, the reply from the staff was \"We don't drive here sir, so we don't know how to get here\". You think they would ask somebody? Hell no! So I drove around for an hour finally getting to the surface and to the hotel. I was then forced to illegally park in the alley to go check in because there was no room to park, or no designated area for people who want to check in. Check in went fine and then, I got to my \"room\". It was literally the size of a small office. The view??? A big ugly office building!!! So I look at the fire escape map and see they gave me the tiniest room available, tucked away in a corner. It was about 30% smaller than the other rooms. So I go downstairs, ready to check out. There were suites available at the Crowne Plaza just 10 minutes away. Begrudginly and I mean begrudginly, the desk person offered up another room. I asked if it was \"park view\" as promised by my certificate, and they said \"no\". I explained that I had reserved park view two weeks earlier. They said \"First come, first served\" and they gave away the room that I reserved!!!! So, anyhow, long story short, I took the new room, which was larger, and made the best of it. As others have said, they put the themostat right by the window, so the room baked no matter how low you put the temp. The food was bland and expensive and their business lounge was an absolute joke. The Holiday Inn Express does a better job at breakfast and happy hour than this place did. Maybe hipsters that enjoy a ton of style with very little substance may enjoy this property, but I prefer a hotel where guests are treated with respect, reservations are kept, rooms are modern AND spacious and the \"extras\" really are extra.

The whole staff was very pleasant and attentive throughout our stay. The wall length firplace in the lobby is a site to see, along with the \"candle lit\" tables in the Filini Lounge. The workout area looked amazing, although we didn't have to to try it out. The parking cost is a bit high at $53/night, but not really out of line with Chicago standards. Our only other complaint, albeit a minor one, was with the minibar/fridge. We were warned by both the desk clerk and bellman that the items were actually on some type of timer. If an item was removed and later put back a charge would still show up on the bill. We were told it was easy enough to have them taken back off, but not really a hassle I wanted to go through at checkout.

Room choices: You get a choice of City View (facing north and west) vs. Park view (facing east and south). I believe both sides should have good view, but I upgraded to a Park View corner room with because I wanted to see the New Year Eve firework close to Navy Pier. The corner room is a slightly larger room than the typical one and has a wrap-around balcony so you can see to sides of the city (I have some reservation about this \"upgrade\", will elaborate later). Other choices you can have is with and without balcony. For those without chilldren, I will definite recommend the room with Balcony because it's nice to be able to go outside. However, those with kids should probably forgo that option as I can definitely imagine a kid can climb over that rail and fall over. The hotel cover the first 20 floor of the Aqua tower, and since it's in downtown Chicago, I definitely recommend asking for room in the higher floors so you can have a better view and get away from some of the street noise. As I mentioned before, we upgraded to the corner room to get a better view of the city. There are 2 benefits and 1 big drawback to this: The main benefit is the expansive view of 2 sides of the building, and a much larger wraparound balcony. Another benefit is that you supposedly gain an extra 10~20% more space. However, the space you supposedly gain cannot be used. The room is designed to get as much of the useable view as possible in a rectangular area. They do that by putting the bathroom in the middle, so the room actually forms a \"U\" shape. You enter the room from one end of the U, and the bed is in the other end. The end result is that most of the space is completely wasted and unusable, and the room actually feels smaller than a regular non-corner room. Unless you plan on spending a lot of time on the wraparound balcony, I don't recommend getting the corner room. Other than that, the room is new, clean, and very modern. Bathroom has a separate stall for shower and toilet, and all the fixture feels very solid and nice. Fitness center/spa: Other things we liked about the hotel is the awesome fitness center that spans 2 floors. There's a large 25m outdoor pool that can be wonderful in the summer, and a 2 lane indoor pool that's useful in the Chicago winter. Hot tub is available inside and outside as well adjacent to the pools. On the other level, you have a very large fitness center with all the standard free and fixed weight equipment, as well as a small half-court basketball court. There is also top notch with a roomy Sauna and Steam room and a full service spa that my wife and I really enjoyed. The fitness center and pool is shared with the locals who own/rent the condo/apartment upstairs. All the locals we met were very nice, but I can imagine that after a few years they may get a bit tired of all the hotel guests sharing the facilities with them. There were also a lot of kids running around the fitness center, and the wait time for the elevator seems a bit long at times. Nevertheless, I thought this fitness center is the best of any business-level hotels I've ever stayed at. Restaurant/bars We didn't get to try the Filini restaurant or the room service, but we did try the bar one the first floor. The food/drink/service were all on par with our expectation, but nothing too special. All in all, we really enjoyed the stay at the hotel. There were a few kinks that should be worked out soon (no towels in the fitness center, 2 of the 4 elevator were down for a period of our stay), but I'll definitely come back next time I'm in Chicago.", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, TX", "Title": "\u201cAmazing new hotel in Chicago\u201d", "Author": "bfpop", "ReviewID": "UR122967935", "Content": "This is not your father's Radisson!

She personalized the check in by introducing the conceirge who we later used, and all the great details of the hotel!!! She was just fabulous! We were very impressed with the design of the room (it was the room with the carpet). We were dissatified with our view, however. As we were heading downstairs we thought we'd bring it up to the front desk, and Jessica the supervisor. She was the outstanding!! She moved our room immediately without hesitation to a Park View which we were much more satisfied with. Last but not least we went to the concierge and were asking Ruben what exactly we should do being it was our first time in Chicago, and he made a full schedule of things including Navy Pier, the current shows going on in the city, and also made us dinner reservations. He is very knowledgeable about Chicago. And his accent was very cute! Great looking staff! Great location! Absolute beautiful design!! I would recommend this hotel to anyone!!!!", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cNice place to stay, but...\u201d", "Author": "Susan K", "ReviewID": "UR122370997", "Content": "We just stayed at the new Radisson Blu for New Years Eve. The hotel is lovely and the rooms new and clean. They are nicely decorated but very small. I asked if we could be upgraded to a better room and was surprised if the room we got was better because it was VERY small and the bathroom didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a tub. The room is decorated in very dark colors of black lacquer, black marble floors, teal carpet. We did look into a corner room that was being cleaned before we left and we were much more impressed. Hardwood floors, light, bright and more earth tones. Corner rooms come with a shower and a tub. We only had a shower in our room; I would have loved a tub. The shower in our room comes with a separate shower wand in addition to the overhead spray, but we could not get it to work, something that no doubt will become a problem in the shower after so many people try to make it work and it will eventually break. There was no information anywhere describing how to use it. Radisson is going for a new more upscale market with this hotel but I noticed a few things that I think they should consider to help obtain that appeal because after I stayed I ultimately left feeling like I stayed in a Radisson. 1. Have 2 robes in the room; not just one. Also, don't place a cardboard advertisement around the waist...tacky. 2. Have towels outside the sauna and steam room for guests to use. We could not find any. I guess we were supposed to bring them from our room. There was no information on this either. FYI, both the sauna and the steam room are coed. Also if you plan to sit in the sauna or steam the only place to cool off after you are finished would be to take a quick shower in the locker room, the lap pool is on the third floor. It was a real let down not to be able to have the pool there. 3. In regards to food, a few more options would be nice; maybe a few kids meal items. The hotel has one Italian restaurant and a lobby bar that serves upscale pizza and appetizers (sorta like tapas). It really is a beautiful hotel, in a quiet area of town only a couple blocks off of Michigan Avenue and very close to Navy Pier.

The room I was in had a gorgeous wrap around balcony, views of downtown, a comfortable soaking tub, elegant bedding and decor, a sense of space and comfort. The hotel also has a lap pool on the third floor and a gym. It is brand new and costs less than the dinosaur hotels in the area. I loved it. 2 small complaints: the parking costs $41. This seems really steep to me given that there is nowhere else to park. And there were lots of kids in the lap pool when I was there. Keep in mind that this really is a lap pool - 2 lanes, 25 yards - just enough room for several swimmers to get a great workout. But one whole lane had kids splashing around. I think this is not a problem in the summer when they have outdoor pools - one lap and one recreational - but in the winter, perhaps the lap pool should be off limits to kids?

Overall - the experience was terrific. The staff goes out of their way to be friendly and helpful. We had a Groupon for a king room. I had asked for possible upgrades - including a $9/night for park view. On check-in, we were told we got that upgrade. I'm not positive the view we had was really what was meant by \"park view\". We were in 1007 - facing north. Looking straight out - we looked into an office building. If we looked right we could see Navy Pier and the river. Looking left - we could see a sliver of the Wrigley building. We did not face the park. I'm not sure if that upgrade included Navy Pier views OR Millenium Park, so we didn't say something. I'm not sure the view we had was worth $9 a night. The room was relatively compact - but nicely laid out. I loved how clean and new it was. There was a wood-laminate floor - with marble floor in the entry area and bathroom. We had a king bed with great bedding. It was very comfortable (though the pillows were rather \"mushy\" - it was good we had 6 of them). The bathroom was beautiful - with a separate soaking tub and walk in shower. It was also very spacious. The sliding door to the bathroom was fine for us - but I could see if you were sharing a room with someone other than a spouse, it could be a problem privacy-wise. It definitely didn't muffle any noises from the bathroom! The closet area was laid out nicely with three drawers and a good-sized safe. The hanging area, however, was a bit small. It was ok for us for just 2 nights - but for a longer stay with 2 people or more - it'd be tough. There was a good-sized flat screen TV and desk area. The public areas were very nice. We enjoyed the bar - and had breakfast one morning in the restaurant. The food and service were excellent. We didn't use the indoor lap pool and spa or health club. The health club area was very large with great equipment and even a half basketball court. In the lobby area - there were a lot of areas to sit and lounge. We were rather surprised by the $51/night charge for parking. That seems rather high to me, particularly as we didn't use an in/out privileges. I've seen others complain about noise in their rooms. We were close to the elevators and had no issue with that. We also couldn't hear neighbors next to us. I also saw someone complain about it not being kid-friendly. Honestly, it's not the type of hotel I'd choose if we still had small kids. I don't think it's fair for someone to expect it to be child-focused.

The \"feel\" of the hotel: the wave design of the \"Aqua\" tower has quickly become iconic in a city renowned for its iconic buildings. It is undeniably chic. With its clean lines, heavy reliance on white, and dark blue neon accents, the lobby reflects the design aesthetic used throughout the hotel. We stayed on a night that was probably one of their lightest for occupancy. Nonetheless, hotel guests used most of the seating areas in the lobby, which appeared to be quite comfortable. The hotel bar: another example of the super-contemporary design of the hotel, my wife enjoyed spending a few minutes in the bar before heading upstairs for the night. I recommend the cappuccino; it's excellent. The room: we stayed in a corner room with a view of Lake Shore East Park, Navy Pier, and a bit of Streeterville. Our king size bed was comfortable. The layout was a bit unconventional. Upon walking through the doorway, the room's closet was on the immediate left. Straight ahead was the coffee maker/refrigerator setup (in a large cabinet). On the wall above and to the left of the cabinet was a small flat-screen TV that faced the desk and chair (on your right as you walk in from the doorway). The bathroom was beautiful. Lots of frosted glass, new fixtures, and lots of space. The tub appeared spacious, but was unused. The separate shower was great. The room had a wrap-around balcony, too. The aesthetic of the room reminded me a bit of high end Ikea. Although it's a beautiful space, it does not have much embellishment. I am hesitant to call it spartan, but the emphasis on white, cool blues, and blonde wood floors and cabinets is undoubtedly minimalist. Service: The hotel staff was superb. The evening manager who checked us in escorted us to the elevator, which was a nice touch. Overall impressions: I think this hotel would be excellent for business travelers. For a romantic weekend in Chicago, it's a bit cold, unless you are really \"into\" modern architecture. The service was great, and the views were fantastic.

Also they say that self parking is $41, that is only if you don't move your car. You can not take it in and out or you will be charged more than $41. Again they didnt mention it in the hotel information. My first night cost me $64, which is outrageous. Apparently, the parking is controlled by the apartment complex, so they have no say at the Radisson on this. At least that is what I was told. We also had bad service at the lobby bar, but I wont go into that, the women was probably having a bad night, because the bar was empty. Warning: the hotel is right next door to the Chicago Fire Deparment and the sirens go all night and day. The sound proofing in the hotel is pretty good, but not enough to cover a loud siren.

My favorite has always been the Park Hyatt, although I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve only stayed there once, as I try to be somewhat budget conscious. My new favorite is the Radisson Blu, and the good news is that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot cheaper than the Park Hyatt. Upon check-in, I was upgraded to a corner room with a balcony. The room was huge with beautiful hardwood floors and light wood furniture. The had a real Nordic minimalist design, which I really like. The bathroom was sleek and modern with a separate shower stall. As much as I always enjoy walking around Chicago, I would have been happy just staying in the room on this trip! An added bonus was that there was free Wi-Fi in the rooms. Other upscale hotels should take notice! However there are too many diversions within the hotel to stay in your room. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very sleek looking bar on the first floor that was pretty busy even on a weeknight. Upstairs from the bar is a modern Italian restaurant that has good food, and although I read poor reviews concerning their service, the night I was there it was pretty good. To work off your big meal, there is a mini indoor basketball court; a tw0- lane indoor 25 yard lap pool, a real gym with lots of equipment (compared to most tiny hotel gyms), and in the summer an outdoor lap pool. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever seen a hotel with such comprehensive fitness facilities. At this hotel the fitness facilities are even better than those at most Four Seasons Hotels, which are typically pretty good. The location of the hotel is right up the street from Millennium Park and maybe a 6-minute walk to the Magnificent Mile. While I prefer the location of hotels that are just west of North Michigan Avenue, this location still pretty decent, and the hotel was so nice that it was worth the extra walk. Note that not all of the rooms have balconies or hard wood floors. One of my work colleagues had a room that had very bright blue carpeting, which she wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t crazy about. So, if you want a certain type of room, you should request it. Rates are really reasonable right now; I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure if it is because the hotel is brand new. In any case, the price is right, at least for the time being\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe Radisson Blu Aqua is not only a great hotel but a great value. To be honest, I was almost hesitant to write this review, because I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m afraid this place will become too popular!", "Date": "December 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edina, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cStylish European Hotel in a great location\u201d", "Author": "JimRiesterer", "ReviewID": "UR121618869", "Content": "Recently we visited Chicago for a holiday shopping weekend and decided to stay at Radisson Blu at Aqua.

Everyone had a smile, was very knowledgeable and genuine. The hotel is beautifully designed and decorated--posh and modern with a beautiful lobby. It's very clean, the rooms are beautiful and clean as well, and guest services was very responsive to all of my needs.The gym is amazing--I was super impressed and was actually excited to work out. I was in town on business and had a million questions on how to get places. The front desk staff was very helpful and even when they didn't know the answer to something, went above and beyond to help. As I was typing this, the front desk girl just came over and handed me printed directions on how to get to the train station for me to make my flight in a few hours, and walked me through everything. I have to say that every person I've encountered in Chicago, from the cab drivers to restaurant managers and servers, have been wonderfully helpful, polite and just plain pleasant.

You have to step inside to turn on the water, so you get drenched with cold water for several minutes.

One of the only 2 hotel elevators close to the lobby was not working. There were no towels at the indoor pool and when the guy arrived with them there was nowhere to put them. He volume control on our TV jumped from 9 to 16, we could not set it at a comfortable level. They could definitely use better access from the self park garage to the lobby, right now it's kind of a maze. The place is set up for the valet parking. The height clearance in the garage is not 9 feet as they told us on the phone before our trip as our box top carrier has many new gouges and scratches on it from the signs and pipes hanging from the ceiling. All these issues I can write off to the place being so new. The one issue that I cannot excuse however were the charges that showed up on our bill for room service and mini fridge items when we didn't use either. They removed them without delay but that's one mistake that is a major red flag in my book. Even if it was an innocent error it leaves me with the impression that they were hoping to make a few extra $$ from me if I didn't take the time to check my bill. Now the positives: Great location, good value when compared to other nice hotels in the area, modern room decor, reminded me of IKEA style furnishings very nicely done. Outstanding workout facility, game room with pool and poker tables and half basketball court. Very friendly and helpful staff. A note on lounge prices - ask for 2 glasses of house red at the bar and get a bill for $26. Not being a regular guest of hotel bars I have no idea if that is typical or not.
