We had a two bedroom one bath suite accommodations. This hotel is straight out of the 1980's. It certainly has not been renovated since then (or so it seems). The bathroom had a huge built it jacuzzi tub which would had been nice except it has been patched up so often that pieces of the terrible patch job floated in the water every time the tub was used. The shower hardly worked up any water pressure so it was difficult to rinse. The carpet in the suite was lose in several places. Not only does this look bad, but it is an incredible hazard (and a liability for hotel management). We did have someone come in daily and make the beds, but that was the extent of the maid service. No real cleaning took place and no supplies were provided. In fact we ran out of toilet paper toward the end of the week, but we had brought our own and did not even bother to request any. Also, there was roof leak just outside our room, so they placed two trash cans to catch the water (very high class!!). The worse part of this though, was that the leak had obviously we the carpet leaving a mildew smell every time we walked into our suite. Finally, there is no parking at the hotel. We were not offered a good option by the hotel staff other than the public lots a few blocks away or the Casino parking (Harrah's) which is $30.00 a night unless you gamble for 30 minutes (which may be free or much more expensive depending on your luck). In sum, I don't have a lot of positive things to say about this hotel. I think the price is hefty for what it offers. I realize that location is everything, but for the same or similar price you can find much nicer accommodations a mile or so a way. It is totally worth it to give up the short distance for a much better set-up. As one might guess, I will not be staying here again.", "Date": "August 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sanford, NC", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice Hotel...

We were in a three room suite in the annex next to the main hotel. The rooms were clean and had everything we needed to relax while we explored in and around New Orleans. Each bedroom, and the living room, had flat screen TVs. The master bedroom had a king bed...the other two had queens. The second bedroom had no closet or windows...but was very quiet. The third had a closet and window...though you only got light and no views. The master bedroom had a nice closet, a bathroom and a window from which you had views of Tchoupitoulas Street. The drawback was that it was easy to hear the noise from below. We conquered the noise by having the fan run continuously at night. The bedroom TVs were very small...had trouble seeing the channel numbers...but they did work well. .....The kitchen was fully equipped with appliances, but was short on some of the cooking utensils. There were plenty of glasses and plates. .....The chairs/couches were comfortable and there was a dining table with chairs. There is an elevator and fire stairs...if you need the exercise. The WiFi was hit and miss...missed most of the week. We could go to the coffee room (they call it the reading room) in the main building and get Internet access at any time. There was coffee and copies of the local newspaper each morning in the reading room, and pastries on Sat-Mon mornings. We had maid service each day. She made our beds, took out the trash, brought us fresh towels when requested, and tidied up every morning...which was excellent!! In the main hotel there is a washer and dryer...$1 in quarters per wash load...and $1 in quarters per dryer load...however, I was able to dry two loads on the first $1. This is one thing I wished they had available in the annex too! They have a very small swimming pool behind the main building...excellent for sitting in to cool off, but not large enough to swim in. There is a outside terrace on the top floor of the main building. On the location... It is perfect!! You are about 100 yds from the trolly stops. We enjoyed riding the air-conditioned often during our stay...we bought a three day pass for the first part of our stay and then one more day late in the week. We found we could easily walk to and from the French Quarter from our hotel, and considering the quality of the food in the many nearby restaurants, walking did us good. the WWII and Civil War museums were about four walking blocks away. We drove in and had to park our vehicle. This was our greatest concern...since the hotel has no parking and the nearby options were $25 dollars per day. There were $15 per day options, but the were a ways off and not very secure. The hotel did offer...and we took it...to give us a card to access a nearby secure parking deck at $20 per day. The advantage was that we could enter and level the parking deck as often as we liked. It was a short walk from the hotel. As for the staff at the hotel, they were very friendly and willing to help us with all our needs and questions. All in all, we found the site to be a very good place to stay and will certainly stay here again the next time we visit New Orleans!", "Date": "August 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Powder Springs, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, great price very comfortable\u201d", "Author": "bking00", "ReviewID": "UR132767323", "Content": "Like many of the other reviewers I was a little hesitant about staying here because of the mixed reviews but decided to take a chance because the price was right.

I love the exposed brick and the big windows in the living area and the front bedroom.

The weirdest part of the entire unit is the spa tub but again, it wasn't bad. The pool area is small but the pool was clean although I didn't have a chance to use it. The rooftop \"terrace\" needs work and UMBRELLAS, it's unbearably hot up there without some shade. The lack of parking is a bit inconvenient but there are plenty of lots within walking distance so again, it's not terrible. This property is typical of a lot of places in New Orleans, it has a lot of character but if you want shiny, new then stay in Metaire (which isn't New Orleans at all) or one of the high rise hotels on Canal Blvd. And as for the reviewer who flipped out over a roach...again, this is New Orleans, it's below sea level folks, it's the norm and that doesn't mean a place is filthy.

The kitchen had just about everything you could want to cook with. The good: The furnishings were well kept but are starting to show some wear and tear. I'd expect the carpet to be replace in a year or so. However, it was clean and suitable, as were the chairs and sofa. The average or less: The wifi was intermittent in the room.

We cooked several meals for breakfast and the only thing missing from the kitchen was a cookie sheet, but we made do. Very nice large kitchen table with six chairs, and very large living room with a flat screen tv on the wall. The bedroom facing the street looked to be the largest, with a bathroom inside. The other two rooms shared a small bathroom. The middle room did not have any windows which our 20 yr old daughter loved. Since the rooms are small, this particular unit placed the dressers in the living/dining room. Sounds strange, and it was, but we had a possitive attitude and it really was not a problem.

Realize that New Orleans is a very old city and most of the building are also very old. Expect that. Yes, a few hotels are new(er) and you might enjoy that kind of establishment over the older ones. We have stayed at many timeshare resorts and most have been quite nice. The Hotel de L'Eau Vive is not a 4 or 5 star resort. If you accept that going into it, you won't be disappointed. No restaurant on site. No internet service (except in their smally lobby), and no fitness center. The only issue I had was the lack of hot water. We were able to work it out by scheduling when we took our daily showers, but you really should not have to do that.

Everyone was very friendly, helpful and kind. They were definitely the bright spot during our stay. Now for the bad. We swapped for this timeshare through Interval International. They should be ashamed for even having this place listed. It was by no means a 4 or 5 star resort. We had a 2 bedroom 1 bath suite on the 3rd floor. The \"elevator\" was a joke! Only one person and their luggage could fit in the elevator at one time, which operated on a pully. I opted for the unsafe, metal, spiral staircase everyday, which was pitch black in the evening because the lights were out. When we asked them to fix it, they only put one bulb there. The pool was more like a bathtub. It was situated in a tiny courtyard that was rat infested! We had to pass through the pool area to get to the room and saw Mickey and his family on a regular basis! We were told that was common because of the sewers and pipes. When asked for clean blankets we were told the board only allows them to wash the blankets twice a month unless there are visable stains!!! When asked for someone to clean the bathroom, the reply was we don't do that - Only when guest leave! They did however give us the cleaning supllies to use ourselves. This place is in desperate need of repair and updating. Disgusting carpet, dark lighting and very old fixtures through out. There was one 19 inch tv for the entire 2 bedroom suite. We were handed the remote at check in. All the windows in our suite looked out to a view of a brick wall. There is so much more but I'm at my limit and can't write much more.

It only had basic cable so no big deal. iThe bath tub was almost ridiculously mammoth sized.Great stocked kitchen with necessary utensils and flatware. My only complaint there was the useless freezer compartment. We didn realize it until we tookout soup made ice cream. It was adequate for a busy tourist couple. It was in a perfect location for visiting. It was far enough from the action but close enough to walk. It took a quick 2 minute walk to the harbor. Maybe 5 minutes to walk to the French Quater and just a little further for Burbon street which I dont recommend for families. Thats my biggest disappointment about New Orleans- not really anything to do about this hotel. New orleans is very beautiful but I didnt get a family vibe to it.

I had stayed in this locale several times & when a unit appeared on the market the spouse & i grabbed it.Stayed in December 2008 - first time back as an owner. Stayed with my spouse & elderly mother. We were there a week. There is a \"refreshing pool\" that is a pleasant place to sit & enjoy a cool refreshing beverage (that you brought outside with you!). We stayed in a 2 bedroom 1 bath unit. The bath is a garden tub for 4 and the shower is inside the tub. This WOULD NOT be easy for someone with limited mobility to access. There are handicap accessible units available though. The two bedrooms each had a queen size bed & chest of drawers. There is a huge common closet near the bathroom for hanging clothing & a large vanity outside the bathroom for makeup, hairdrying etc. The layout of the unit is somewhat circular so the bedrooms are well seperated. The kitchen, dining & living room is an open area and the sofa pulls out to a bed. The bedding was comfortable in all 3 places. Unlike most timeshares this is cleaned on a daily basis. Plenty of towels, extra blankets available etc. The staff has always been more than willing to help & this trip was no different. While it was quiet one afternoon I asked to be shown one of the newly remodeled suites. MY preference will be the older units that have brick walls, and a handful of oddities, but for those who prefer new & pristine - these are sweeeeeet! Very modern, new lcd tv, king bed etc. There isn't a restaurant on premises, but within a quick walk there are several options. Also there is a grocery that will deliver. We kept snacks in the room, but with all the wonderful restaurants in New Orleans it was so hard to think about skipping that aspect!!! Now onto the important stuff - the hotel is close to Harrah's (walk down the alley & you are there), 2 blocks from Canal Street, 1/2 mile from Bourbon St, near the Aquarium, the Convention Center. Name your desire & you are probably close to it. We flew in & once at the hotel walked or took the streetcars. All 3 lines have pick up points within a few blocks of the hotel.

We were pretty clean, but with this many people, the floors and bathrooms needed cleaning. A poor job was done when vacuuming and cleaning the tile floors.

I understand that the building itself is old, and admit that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s age and history lends a certain charm to the facility. It also, to an extent, accounts for the cramped common areas, but not for the worn carpet and overall castaway feel of the furnishings in them. The entryway has a ramp for wheelchairs and right next to it two steps with no banister on either side. One misstep and I landed at the bottom, with gratefully nothing more than a sore wrist; I wonder how many other people have done the same.

The cover on the ironing board was so past its prime that the big scorch mark on it completed its disgusting look! Needless to say, it went unused! The patio area around the pool was swept, but needed a good scrubbing, and flooded considerably when it rained (no drains) and it was our only way in and out.

The jacizzi tub didn't work, they said they would fix it but never did. What did it for me was, the day before I was to leave, I went to the roof patio to take the last few pictures in my camera of the skyscrapers. As I started down the stairs I fell flat on my face (right side). The wooden stairs were rotten and split horozonially (worn down) on the edges so when you step on them you lose your balance and fall forward. There were no railings to grab and no motion detector lights or lights. I fell on my face, my right knee and my right hand that I had just had surgery on 3 months before. I was bleeding from my knee and my hand and knee immediately swelled up. I went back to my room and called the front desk. I explained what happened and asked for help. I was told 1. no one was there to help me and the manager had gone home . I asked what should I do? I was told. 2. I don't know, then I was told 3. I could go to the hospital and the nearest hospital was in Meterie. I said It's 8:30pm and I'm injured, I'm from California, I don't know where Metairie is and I don't have a rental car. I was again told they didn't know what to do. I asked if they had a Policy telling them what to do if a resident had a medical emergency ie., a heart attack etc. or injury and I was told 4. they had no policy. The clerk asked if I wanted her to call the manager at home and I said yes. A few minutes later she called and said, \" The manager said, If I was hurt to write down what happened and send them the bill.\" Frustrated, I called the advice nurse at Kaiser Hospital in California and was assessed for broken bones and was told to use ice packs then, advised to go to the Emergency room as soon as I got home which is what I did. Still swollen when I got home , they took X-rays of my knee and hand I didn't have to have another surgery on my hand. Now one year and 3 months later I learned that I also had a cracked rib on the right side. My knee now has a permanent scar to remind me of this horrible experience, the face swelling went down with ice. After I returned home I called to speak with the manager at least 5 times, I left 5 messages for the management staff to return my calls to discuss the matter and STILL to this day I have not received a call acknowledging the accident or any of my calls. I tried to access the bills associated with my treatment but my insurance is through the State of California and a third party such as an attorney could access the records but, not the patient. I contacted 12 different attorneys one in California and 11 in Louisiana to assist me with thes matter and was told by the 9 who did contact me that my \"injuries were not severe enough for them to take on the case\" So, I just gave up.

The feel is like having your own private pied a tere in the center of a wonderful city of faboulous restaurants and wonderfull old world culture. The hotel although technically is a time share is a two building 3 story brownstone structure which is an historical landmark having once been part of a sugar plantation in the 1800's, a former bordello in the early 1900's and later transformed into a hotel/and timeshare property.

I arrvived early in the morning and was able to leave my luggage at the hoelt while I explored the city. Check in is 4:00PM but my Room 301 was ready early and I checked in at 3:00PM. My two bedroom unit was immaculate. Again, this is a transformed historical building so if you are looking for a glitzy, traditional hotel/with restaurants then stay at the Sheraton or Marriott around the corner. What I liked about my stay was the size of the unit , which had a large living room, breakfast area, kitchen with microwave, full size stove, 3/4 size refrig with all cooking utensils, plates, dishwasher, blender, toaster, etc. I only used the kitchen to make breakfast because my intention was to to eat out for dinner and my days were at the convention center. My bedroom had an attractive antique wrought iron brass bed and the other bedroom had a similar queen size bed all with ample storage/dresser units. The ceilings are high with the original exposed brick and the windows are at least 6 feet high allowing sunlight and an airy feel. My unit faced the street, but surprisingly since it is a side street it was very quiet considering I was in the middle of the city. The shower was wonderfull with immediate hot water and excellent water pressure. After a long day on my feet at the convention center the shower was quite relaxing. I did not test the jacuzzi but it easily could fit two adults. My toilet sometimes made a funny sump/pump sound when flushed which only happened on an occassion and lasted a few minutes and must have had something to do with the age or renovation process. However, I never heard any sounds from the other units. This was a very quiet private building. There was daily maid service with fresh towels if you left them on the floor and the bed was made every day. I wasn't expecting this. The TV /DVD/VCR was fine with basic cable stations. The air conditioning was fine although in Nov the temp is in the high/low 60's/70's.There is a coin washer/dryer on the 4th floor, and the roof top deck was being renovated. There is an inner courtyard type small pool with wrought iron table and chairs, maybe more like a dipping pool but it did not look like the water was filtered so unless it is maintained differenly during the summer months I wouldn't have gotten in it. The location is key as you can walk to the French Quarter, walk to the convention center, walk to the Riverfront, Canal street is one block over, walk to Harrah's Casino if you are into gambling, and take a scenic ride on one of the street cars. There are also wonderfull restaurants within the same block. August Restaurant +++++one of the finest in New Orleans is at one corner and Mother's Restaurant is at the other corner all within the same block as the Hotel. I ate at Mother's twice which is traditional Creole comfort food. The people are lined up outside for lunch in three piece suits in this unpretensious famous restaurant. Try the Deep Fried Oyster/PoyBoy sandwich or Etoufee or Gumbo over rice. I don't think they have their own parking lot but there are two private lots in the same block. There is no long term parking on this street. Also what I liked about this hotel although technically a time share is that there was no hard core selling or person pestering you about taking a tour of the building. There was a flyer placed under my door letting me know that there were units/weeks available but leaving it up to me to make the first move if interested. The nice young lady at the front desk printed out my airline boarding passes for me over their internet site but there isn't any public internet use and I'm not sure if the units hook up to internet. My own Verizon wireless worked just fine from the unit on my laptop. New Orleans is a wonderfull city with a lot to offer and is makng a fast come back post-Hurricane Katrina at least in the City/French Quarter. This was a devastated city but the people are resilient and seem to be going out in a big way to welcome visitors back to their city. I look forward to staying at the Hotel De L'Eau Vive on my next trip to New Orleans.", "Date": "November 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Massillon, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cWhat a disappointment - we checked out and went to Wyndham\u201d", "Author": "Sioweng", "ReviewID": "UR8139451", "Content": "We recently selected this property through our timeshare....Interval ranked it as a five star property...it was hardly one. First of all, there is no parking.....you have to walk four blocks to a public parking area at $20/night. Access to the room was past the poor excuse for a pool that floods when it rains and you need to wade through it. The next challenge was up an extremely narrow spiral stair case that could barely accomodate getting the luggage up intact. The next was a room that was dirty, in disrepair, and disheveled with mismatched furniture. To top it off, there was an open jar of vaseline on the night stand....should I say expectations? The remote control for the TV did not work so they gave me the instruction book and told me to fix it myself....I refused and \"politely\" gave it back to them. Next was the event of the Bachelor party thrown by various members of the sheriff's department....loud music..lot's of drinking and shrieking by female voices and the hoots of the male participants..along with thick, smelly cigar smoke.....what was worse was the front desk clerk...a youn lady more consumed with TV than the welfare of her occupants...she refused to do anything about it....she was clearly sympathetic to their cause having enjoyed their fruitful food buffet for dinner. I was able to personally appeal to law officers but they informed me that New Orleans did not have any ordinances regarding noise, but they did turn downj the sub-woofer on the stereo so we did not have to continue experiencing the base pounding through our bedroom floor. The next day, a further complaint to the manager generated no action......we checked out and moved to the Wyndham Avenue on St Charles via a re-booking from Interval, the time share service. It was supposed to be a lower clase property, but we found it delightful by comparison. As for the Hotel de L'Eau Vive, I would never recommend it to anyone unless you truly are used to alternative living.", "Date": "July 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Georgia", "Title": "\u201cWhat a hole on earth!!!!\u201d", "Author": "mmechas71", "ReviewID": "UR7557010", "Content": "We exchanged our resort in Vegas to visit New Orleans this year. we were really dissapointed from the front staff til lhow the hotel is mantained.

The room had a small patio which was full of table top glass and old fake plants covered on dust !!! We will never go there to that hotel.

But overall not that much a factor leading to this average rating. The Hotel is a timeshare located in a great spot between the Warehouse district(great for eating and entertainment) The French Quarter(great for beer and walking around for tourist sites)The Riverwalk is a must so is the Natchez steamboat ride.The trolleys are close by and run often down to the Garden district which is what you make of it,Although at night it seems caution applies. Park your car better yet dont bring it because everything is a short walk or local transportation 1.25 exact change 5.00 day pass is excellent. The zoo and aquarium are okay but I am from NYC so it tough to match up against ours. the riverwalk mall is excellent to make your first stop and go all the way thru it because ,well just because. also it has maps brocures and places that are stomach friendly to eat at. The reason I say this is although I like spicey food they think if it says cajun or creole it has to be loaded with red cayenne pepper.after 2 days it gets old and my wife isnt a fan of spice.AND I mean everything has it on it.well almost.Bring money since nothing is cheap although we found the New Orleans prices reasonable for a tourist trap. The good points of the trip were many. The locals are very friendly,the food overall was good,it is easy to get around.there werent many vagrants and they werent obnoxius.Harrahs was right across the street but we didnt gamble that much.The myth of accents being so thich you have trouble is bebunked.crescent citycafe (which is near the cigar factory and THE Big Easy drink place dont miss either)obriens,mothers and one other place we ate were great.sorry I was drinking that night.There is an A+P supermarket located on royal and ST.Peters in the Quarter that is really good. bad points were food spicy ,crawfish are a local thing not for real seafood eaters ,Harrahs buffet stunk.Did i mention bring money.", "Date": "March 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mt Samson Queensland", "Title": "\u201cRated this apartment hotel the very best\u201d", "Author": "Trav11", "ReviewID": "UR1563944", "Content": "This small apartment hotel on the border of the French Quarter and the CBD is so comfortable and stylish, with every facility one could need.
