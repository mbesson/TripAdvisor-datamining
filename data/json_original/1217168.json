The room we had on the top floor faced the Blue Mosque and had a terrace; the view out of our window and terrace was extraordinary and worth paying a bit extra for. There is a discount for payment in cash on arrival, which we did. Staff is very friendly and helpful, and they stored bags for us whilst we did a few days outside Istanbul. Breakfast is on a subterranean floor, and included a good choice of both hot and cold options. There are also first floor and minus one level rooms, caveat emptor. Rooms on one side face the sea. There is a terrace with great views and clement weather service. Our room was large, and everything worked. Steep sided bath/shower. Only issue for us was that the closet safe was not bolted to the closet so it was portable.

Our rooms had a small balcony overlooking the street. You need to be in the 400's to see the Blue Mosque over the trees.

Couldn't understand why. Another nuisance was the transportation back to the airport.

Erhan and Jasmine made our checkin a breeze, cold drinks, Turkish Delight and biscuits offered whilst paperwork was done. We were shown to our rooms, 503 and 504 on the 3rd floor and within minutes hot coffees were delivered to enjoy on our balconies whilst taking in breathtaking views of the Blue Mosque and Bosphorous. Can thoroughly recommend the Penthouse Rooms. Large, fabulous balconies and views to die for, lounge seating and really just very well equiped rooms for a 7 night stay. The only problem with our rooms and not one that would prevent us from staying here or in those rooms again was the moving of chairs around on the Roof Top Terrace from early morning until very late at night. As breakfast is served there from as early as 6.30am and used until very late as a bar area the terrace was in constant use and why not as the views from here were the best you would get anywhere. We ourselves used the bar everynight for Happy Hour where Memdu(sorry for spelling) would serve our drinks along with complimentary nuts and fresh fruit. Most times we just never moved on. As meals are not served in hotel, we were able to go out and bring food back and enjoy whilst having our drinks and just plain relaxing after extensive days of sightseeing beautiful Istanbul and touring both Gallipoli and cruising to the Black Sea. No need to get dressed up and go out, the hotel was fabulous for just about anything. All Staff were the friendliest, most helpful of any hotel I have been too. Nothing was any trouble and all requests were met efficiently and with the lovliest smiles. The rooms had tea coffee making facilities but tea and coffee were available all day on the terrace compliementary if you just needed to have one more photo or view of the outstanding Blue Mosque/Istanbul or Bosphorous. Amazing Erhan organized tours, private guides, airport transfers, irons etc. and there was not one thing we would have changed about any of it. If Erhan could have made it cooler (so hot in Instanbul in July) I think he would have tried. Istanbul is a fabulous city and along with the people make it an outstanding destination and of course where else would you stay but The Ferman. I would just like to congratulate ALL staff at the hotel for making our visit such a memorable one and would have quite happily stayed on as we became just so relaxed and although have only arrived home this morning am already missing our drinks sessions on the Terrace, coffees on our balcony and the best hotel in Istanbul.

This single feeling of ease cannot be over emphasized. You can walk through the neighborhood and get the Turkish hello, which is how they try to get you to buy their wares. Remember, Turks are very friendly, and as soon as you acknowledge their greeting in a friendly fashion, they change immediately from challenging to accommodating. In Room 501, you have a balcony overlooking the Marmara Sea. Off to the left, you can see the beginning of the Bosphorus, one of the most beautiful bodies of water on this planet.

The breakfast was very different from what we have in North America; however, it was an interesting experience. The hotel staff was very friendly and everyone we encountered spoke English.

We trekked around Sultanahmed area for quite some time and looked at many different hotels - all with small rooms (this is the old building style). Finally we came upon the hotel Ferman. The front-desk manager Erhan listened to our story with sympathy. He offered us a room with patio/balcony and swing, with a view towards the sea. When we view the room we discovered that the hotel had rooms far larger than those of all the hotels we had seen up until that point, which it turns out was because the hotel building itself was relatively recently built. We were so relieved to finally find this comfortable, chic, and welcoming hotel. The decor is very tasteful, and the views and spacious feel of the hotel extremely relaxing. We found the beds to be extremely comfortable, unlike a previous reviewer, and actually thought the railway behind the hotel added to the hotel's charm. We certainly didn't lose any sleep. The rooftop terrace where we enjoyed a delicious breakfast every day has stunning views of the sea and the mosque. Our only criticism would be that it got a bit chilly up there late at night. We were treated to a complimentary free meal, and free airport transfer (unlike the hotel we had booked online which wanted to charge us a high price!), and this was all for a very reasonable price. All of the staff were extremely attentive; if we ever needed something and it was lacking, all we had to do was ask and they arranged it for us promptly. Again we commend Erhan the front-desk manager for his professional manner, and advice to us on places to go, and general insight about the area and Turkish culture.

The Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia are a few minutes walk away, as is the tram stop. The Ferman Hotel (a ferman is a written declaration by the ruler, on a scroll, in elaborate calligraphy; they have examples as wall decoration) is modern and nicely decorated. We had a king suite as we were staying for a week and wanted plenty of space. The room was spacious, with a large balcony overlooking the Sea of Marmara (as well as the train tracks). The trains are noisy, but don't run between midnight and 6am, so it's not really an issue. By 6am the morning call to prayer will have wakened you anyway! The King Suites are on the 3rd floor, directly beneath the breakfast terrace. The noise of people going up the stairs to breakfast wasn't an issue, but the scraping of chairs just above the ceiling was noisy, but then breakfast doesn't start until 7am, so that wasn't a problem. The breakfast terrace is a great plus point (all the adjacent hotels also have them) as the view is spectacular. In the middle of our stay, the weather deteriorated and breakfast was moved to a soulless basement room with no windows, which is it's winter quarters, and much inferior. Breakfast itself was the usual buffet spread and quite acceptable, but the choice of cold meats is limited due to lack of pork products. Coffee lovers beware, the coffee comes out a vending-type machine and is not very nice. Other than Turkish coffee (which isn't drunk at breakfast time) the only coffee that seemed available even when we went to a large hotel was this vending machine type. Some of the hotel rooms open directly off the lobby, and some are in the basement; they clearly would not have a view, and may be noisy although there is not much street noise in this area. The front desk staff were not as knowledgeable as those in other European hotels e.g. they could not give us a map, or recommend a restaurant, or help with directions for public transport. All of them were, however, very pleasant. Our guide book was invaluable for these functions (DK Eyewitness Travel Top 10 Istanbul). Istanbul is a victim of it's own popularity; the place is seething with tourists both from the hotels but also pouring off the cruise ships. We were told it is only quiet in December. The crush of people at all the major attractions certainly detracts from the enjoyment of the visit: we are talking Sistine Chapel type queues and throngs of people. Restaurants tend to be as expensive as England, and we had some lovely meals in really characterful restaurants such as \"Rami\" where you dine looking at the Blue Mosque, \"Sarnic\" which is in an old cistern, or \"The Orient Express\" which is the restaurant in the station where the original Orient Express used to arrive and depart.", "Date": "November 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cVery good value for money\u201d", "Author": "pige_paa_ferie", "ReviewID": "UR86971737", "Content": "My experience with Ferman was good from beginning to end.

It was hot and humid below ground, and we were quite uncomfortable with only a fan which they brought in for us.

I found a local food store close by and the location to the sites was perfect. The charming Ottoman-styled lobby had free lokum (Turkish Delight) and biscuits to nibble. The staff was extremely helpful and just downright good people. With the 10% cash discount my room cost was decent considering the costs of rooms in perfect weather high-season September in Istanbul and I asked for a higher priced room. I overheard one man commenting that he paid half the price of the Hilton and got a lovely ocean view room. I heard only one muffled nightly call to prayer in my quiet room as I slept soundly my entire five day stay. It was almost a perfect number of days to spend in Istanbul, although I wanted one more day to see the Chora Church, Ortakoy and the Dolmabahce Palace. I walked almost everywhere the detailed Rick Steve's Istanbul guidebook led me. The Lonely Planet guide had smaller print and was not as complete as Rick Steve's. The combination of the book and the metro made a more expensive guide completely unnecessary. The only attraction I wasn't amazed by was the whirring devish as I found the production rather boring, but a Turkish bath is not to be missed! As a woman travelling alone, I found Istanbul an extremely safe, warm and friendly place to travel unaccompanied. Every time I got turned around, someone assisted me and they didn't want to sell me a carpet! I was most bothered by the carpet salesman and guides around some of the famous attractions, but only in a slightly annoyed way. When I learned they received a nice commission for their salesmanship in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s troubling economic times, I understood why they were persistent. As an older traveler, I was most impressed with a lively conversation I experienced with a small group of young businessmen who kindly paid for my lunch as I was dining in one of Istanbul\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s famous eateries. The food in Istanbul was SO much tastier and healthier than the State's and I became addicted to ayran, the local yogurt drink and fresh squeezed fruit juices, particularly pomegranate. I ate everywhere, even at the self-serve local Turkish eateries. Don't listen to the guidebooks when they try to tell you the old Sultanahmet area is not THE best place to hang your Turkish fez as I couldn't have asked for a better fun-filled vacation and a classier place to stay than the finely appointed, centrally located and brand-new Ferman.", "Date": "September 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portsmouth, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant Hotel, Excellent staff in a perfect Location.

(I booked an extra room for our friends to join us) We had a 'Sultan's Room' (404) with a little balcony on the street side looking towards the Blue Mosque.The action in the street was so great to watch, children playing and locals walking by, that the Mosque view became unimportant. (It is just up the road, you will walk past it every day!) The room is a good size and very clean and comfortable with an area to sit with a little table. The rooms with no balcony are a bit smaller, but still very nice. I had read worries about train noise on the side with the sea view so I chose the Mosque side. However the sea view was great and the A/C was very good indeed so you could keep the windows shut at night.(We did anyway). You will get woken early with a call to prayer from the Mosques wherever you are. All part of the fun. We loved breakfast on the roof. There was plenty to choose from and Mahmut and Adran were always fun and helpful. Do not expect a fry up. (Stay home for that.) I had read the view was good,. but wow, not THAT good.

On our budget, all I really wanted was a great location and a clean room at a good price. This hotel exceeded our expectations. The rooms are beautifully decorated and ours was spotless and cleaned well every day. We couldn't have been happier with the location. Not only is it walking distance to some of the major sights, the neighborhood itself is very charming, and the hotel is on one of its quietest streets. With that said, we had an ocean view room and there is a commuter train that goes by about every half hour very close to the hotel. I think it stops at night because it didn't keep me up. If it had been cooler and we had had the window open (we had a/c on), it would have been pretty loud. But it's just the noise of a train on tracks - you hear it coming, passing quickly, and then going away; it's not a sudden or jarring noise. Ear plugs probably would have totally erased it. And like I said, it never woke me up. What did sometimes semi-wake me was the call to prayer, but you're not going to avoid that in Istanbul. The staff said that streetside rooms with views of the Blue Mosque are somewhat quieter. I would have been happy to have a view of the Blue Mosque - it wasn't like we were sitting in the room much looking at the Sea. There was plenty of time on the water outside of the hotel. And the Mosque is beautiful. It might be noisier on the 5th floor - we were on the 4th - because that's where people get off the elevator in the morning to walk up to the roof for breakfast. I wish people would keep the volume down when they know others could be sleeping. The staff is very friendly and helpful. They were very patient in waiting for us to get enough cash out of the ATM to pay for our room. They answered all our questions, helped us plan sightseeing, and made reservations at a couple of restaurants for us. Besides being near the major sights, the hotel is also a quick walk to the tram station. If you buy a token near the entrance for 1.5 Turkish lira, you can hop on the street car and get to most of the other sights you'll want to see. We rode it a lot. And if you're really up for it, you can even walk to most of the big sights with a pair of good shoes. The view from the roof terrace is extraordinary. We didn't end up drinking on the roof in the afternoon like we had thought we would. The front desk said they'd send someone up (it looked like they had soft drinks and beer in cans), but we told them never mind and we went to one of the many other rooftop bars and restaurants in the area. We found a place that we think may have the very best view in Istanbul, or at least in that part of the city. The Seven Hills Restaurant has a roof terrace with the best views of the Sea of Marmara, the Blue Mosque, and the Aya Sofia. It's the highest terrace in the area, so there's nothing blocking the 360 view. Try going there when the sun is setting so you can see it in daylight and also at night. Amazing! The food isn't bad either. And Turkish wine is surprisingly good. We drank wines from all over the country.

We stayed at the Ferman from 23rd to 30th April 2010 in one of the King Suites on the top level with a magnificent view of the Bosphorus meeting the Sea of Marmara. The room was plenty big enough for the week with a large semi-private balcony, which afforded us a neck-craning view of the Blue Mosque as well. The accompanying photos were all taken in our room or from our balcony. Handy to the major tourist sites on foot, the trams made it easy to reach those outside Sultanahmet or simply return closer to the hotel with tired children. Take care - many of the streets are cobbled and without stroller/pushchair-friendly footpaths. However, if you plan to take cars or taxis for shorter trips, the traffic and narrow streets may defeat you. Our 2 and 5 year-old stayed free of charge, sharing the sofa bed and they loved to watch the metro as it whizzed by. The double-glazing meant that the noise was never obtrusive and we slept undisturbed. We did hear the morning call to prayer and although we are used to this, it did droan on a while. But if you want to be in the middle of the tourist beat, don't complain about the atmosphere! The duty manager was most often Ms Ece Acar who had helped immensely with pre-arrival queries, airport pick-up and tour bookings. All of the staff seemed genuinely friendly and every request was met promptly and with a smile. Only one hiccup in the tour bookings (due to an understandable language difficulty) but this was more than made up for by our 1/2-day cruise of the Bosphorus \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a charming boat with a family-like crew offering personal and complete service. The brochures are at reception, so just ask Ece to book one for you upon arrival. Despite being advertised, the top-floor restaurant was still in construction and room service was unavailable, even from their nearby sister hotels. Of course, we ate out every day and most nights, so it was less of a burden than we had imagined, even with small children in tow. A breakfast buffet was available every morning in the basement dining room.

Arrival: At the time of our stay, there was an offer of a free pick-up from the airport plus a few extras if the stay was for 7 nights. I emailed the hotel ahead of our stay informing them of our arrival time and when we arrived at the airport, we found that nobody was there to collect us. After searching through the throngs of people with placards checking for our names, we eventually heard our names announced over a tannoy system as due to a short delay on our flight, the driver got a little fed up with waiting at the gate for us! Nice! After a 25-30 minute drive, we arrived at the Ferman. Initially, we were allocated a ground floor room which was huge but not ideal because the hotel is built infront of a railtrack so every time a train went past, the noise was loud enough to make me jump. In addition, you could hear everything that was going on in the reception/lobby area just outside the room. I spoke to the young man on reception at the time (Sinan Erdogan) and he said he would speak to the manager about arranging a room change. I was quite surprised when I was told later that the manager said we could change rooms but we would be charged extra for this. Not a good start to our holiday. The following day, I was informed by Sinan that a room had just been vacated on the first floor and we could move free of charge. He kindly allowed us to inspect a similar room first and we were moved later once the vacated room had been cleaned. Fantastic! However, once the room was ready for us to move into, the porter who was going to move our luggage up for us decided to walk into our room without knocking and I had just come out of the shower! I screamed and ducked behind a sofa. A genuine mistake though; the porter was extremely embarrassed and very apologetic. No major harm done and something my husband still chuckles about to this day as apparently I screamed like a little girl and he'd never seen me move so fast! A small fruit platter was delivered to us by way of apology, which wasn't necessary as it was a genuine mistake but a very nice gesture nevertheless, which we appreciated. The room: The room on the first floor was not as big as on the ground floor but as it was higher up, so the noise from the passing trains wasn't as loud. The bed was large and very comfortable. The furnishings were elegant and I would describe the decor as a contemporary take on the Ottoman style. The TV had only one English channel (BBC News) and a few annoying music channels, but we weren't in Istanbul to watch the telly! The en-suite bathroom was absolutely fine with a bath and overhead shower with toiletries replaced daily if we used them. Service: The staff were polite and helpful. Some more than others. The porter was never comfortable with us after the incident of the screaming woman in a towel, which was understandable! :0) Sinan (the chap on reception) was polite and informative but rather reserved. Another young man at the hotel called Murad was similar in his approach. As I mentioned earlier, as part of an offer that was on at the time, for a 7 night stay you got a few free extras. I realised very quickly that unless you don't ask, you don't get. Not a major problem, but it would have been better service for them to have made sure that all parts of the special offer were fulfilled without us having to keep asking. Two members of staff that were there at the time of our stay deserve a special mention from us. A lovely young lady called Ece who shared reception duty with Sinan and a lovely young man called Adnan who always looked after us at breakfast time on the terrace. These two went out of their way to make us feel comfortable and were very welcoming and helpful. Ece gave us lots of good recommendations for things to see and do and was excellent at helping us to decipher maps and directions. Unfortunately, my mobile phone was stolen from my bag without me knowing on a tram journey, and she helped me to find the Tourist Police Station so I could get a report for insurance purposes. Adnan was wonderful too. He really went out of his way for us and actually took us to the souks when he finished his shift at the hotel. He gave up his own time to show us around and make sure we knew how much we should really be paying for things. Haggling in Istanbul was great fun! Everyone you walk past in the souks will try and get you in their shops and when you say 'no, thank you' they ask 'but why?' I'm sure lots of people would find this irritating but I found it really funny and enjoyed the banter and atmosphere. It's all part of the adventure that is Istanbul! Location: The hotel is in a great location in the old Sultanahmet district of Istanbul. It is a 10 minute walk from the stunning Blue Mosque, Aya Sofia and pretty much everything else you would want to see in the area. There are plenty of bars/restaurants nearby to try, again about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. The hotel is close enough to easily access the main attractions of Istanbul but is in just the right spot to make you feel as though you are in a calm, peaceful place away from the hustle and bustle of the centre. The only teeny-tiny niggle that may bother some people about the location was the train tracks directly behind the hotel but it really wasn't a major problem for us, provided you don't have the room on the ground floor! Breakfast: The best thing about breakfast was where it was served. The roof terrace, (open 24 hours a day) provided us with wonderful views of the Blue Mosque at night and the sparkling Marmara Sea in the morning. Adnan was always on hand for a friendly chat and to deliver his usual excellent standard of service. The food itself was nothing to write home about. Although breakfast was buffet style, there really wasn't much to choose from. Boiled eggs, marble cake, a selection of breads, spreads and some pastry type thingies. However, we managed just fine and always ate plenty to make sure we were ready for the day ahead. Concluding notes: This is a perfectly good base to explore the delights of Istanbul from. I've read some recent reviews from people who have stayed more recently and it appears that service has really improved and the teeny-tiny niggly things have been sorted (The hotel was quite new when we stayed). I've given the hotel 4 out of 5 because of the teeny-tiny niggly things we experienced (like being given a bill at check-out when we had pre-paid, luckily I had printed out evidence of our pre- payment or it could have become quite awkward!) but I must say that anyone considering this hotel should definitely go for it. The pros far outweigh the one or two cons.", "Date": "May 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "northeast UK", "Title": "\u201cExcellent staff, great location\u201d", "Author": "soozib", "ReviewID": "UR63486715", "Content": "The staff in this hotel are brilliant.

Beds extremely comfortable - along with all furniture in room. Only negative thing I can think of is that shower head came off on first day, but was fixed by the time we got back that afternoon; If you're a light sleeper, you're probably not going to have any sleep-ins in Istanbul due to the frequent calls to Prayers, but would suggest asking for room at front of Ferman hotel as trains at back of hotel can be loud - only if you're a very light sleeper though. Staff: All staff spoke English and were most helpful - 100%!

Accustomed to staying in nicer hotels in the states, we were unsure what to expect. Upon arrival, we were shown 5 different room types (honestly, all of them looked great) and decided in the interest of money and general room similarity to go with the \"Sultans Room\" (Contained a King sized bed, not two twins spliced together as is customary in many European hotels, a flat screen television of roughly 32 inches, a small balcony overlooking a quiet street and the Blue Mosque, a nice bathroom w/ a shower that had excellent water pressure, and individual remote control climate control), or the 2nd tier of rooms. The Sultans Room appeared identical to the \"Ocean's Room\" (one price tier higher) other than the obvious difference in view. As others have mentioned, the service at this hotel is truly wonderful. Our first day, being jet lagged, my wife slept in until 10 am, while I had already grabbed breakfast from the hotel. Although an hour past when breakfast was due to end, upon leaving the hotel to start our day, Ece (a true testament to the hotel's staff, and always a welcome face at the front desk) asked my wife if she wanted to grab breakfast as they had kept it open knowing that she had yet to eat. Wow, seriously?!! The location of the hotel was also really ideal for those who want to see the historic sights that Istanbul has to offer. A short walk uphill and through the Arasta Bazaar finds you face to face with the Hagia Sophia and Blue Mosque. The Basillica Cistern as well as the tramway are also quite close (The Basillica is roughly 400 meters from the Hagia Sophia and Blue Mosque and is adjacent to the Sultanahmet tram stop which can be used to get to the ferries or funicular to get to Taksim Square). Also, there are roughly 20 - 30 restaurants within 4 city blocks of the hotel. Again, the location really can't be beat. I am a very picky individual, and as far as this hotel is concerned I really couldn't find any downside. Is this hotel good for the price? Definitely, and then some. In all honesty, a similar hotel would cost you at least $200/nt in the states if it were located in the heart of a major city. The biggest complaint an individual could potentially have would be the call to prayer, but again, if you have a problem with this then Istanbul probably isn't the place for you. The 6 am call woke my wife or I up a couple of days, but we found ourselves amazed versus annoyed. Unless completely sound proofed, I don't know that any hotel in Sultanahmet is oblivious to this.

It works, at least for the owners, il you consider the luxurious cars parked in front of them ! We recommand the fish restaurant about 100 meters away (Ece knows it) and the modest but authentic Istamblue which delivers lunch to various shop's owners.

Since we wanted to do some of the mandatory sightseeing, but also go out to bars and clubs, this was perfect for us. We had a Sultan's room and stayed for about a week to celebrate New Year's Eve in Istanbul. The hotel looked very new, I think it opened about a year ago. The hotel rooms were decorated in \"ottoman style\" (it looked very posh, with a nice ceiling lamp and everything), the bathroom was clean and modern. When arriving at the hotel, the receptionist Elhanaden and me sat down for a welcome drink and he was going to tell me about the activities and tours possible in Istanbul. I had already been in Istanbul in summer, so instead we chatted about travelling experiences through India and Southeast-Asia. For New Year's Eve, none of the activities suggested by the hotel really interested us (like going on a boat trip), so the receptionist Ece spontaneously decided to invite us to join her and her family to go to a club in the Taksim area. So we celebrated New Year's Eve with her and enjoyed it very much. We usually slept very long. The breakfast buffet was officially open from 7.30 to 10.30 am. We arrived roughly at noon, since we had been out the night before. They re-opened the breakfast buffet only for us, we were very thankful for that :-) The view from the hotel terrace on the Marmara Sea and the Blue Mosque is beautiful. Unfortunately it was a bit chilly during winter time (the terrace was open 24/7 though and service was available). We've been told that the hotel wants to put a glass roof on the terrace during winter time and add a small fitness room in the basement.

A digression - you need very good directions for the taxi driver when you arrive at the airport (or anywhere else); street addresses in Istanbul are actually not that useful, so make sure you print directions out for the taxi driver. This is a \"boutique\" hotel, the sort of thing we usually shy away from because many places use that description to get away with tiny, sort of exotic rooms and decoration - but in this case you don't have to worry. The rooms are a good size, the breakfast is good, and as I said the staff worked very hard to make us happy. It is a relatively new hotel, and they are working hard to compete successfully. The best part of our stay was that we ended up with visa problems, and had to call from the airport to see if they could take us back, and they did very quickly and happily, commenting that we were like family. Very nice! Anyway, our stay extended another week, and we couldn't have been happier. The wireless internet works very well - more and more an essential of travel, I find.

Located on a picturesque street between the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous, the Ferman is a real gem. It still feels brand new and is absolutely spotlessly clean. I stayed in a very large room off the lobby - loved the furnishings which are modern but have a little bit of opulent bling (e.g. the trendy chandelier-style light fittings and silver sofa!). Much has been said on here about the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff and I agree wholeheartedly. Many thanks to Sinan, Ece and the rest of the staff for making my stay so pleasant. There were some little touches too that made the Ferman extra special - from the hotel-branded complimentary toiletries and slippers, etc. (even the tissue box has the hotel's gold and burgundy branding) to the platter of fruit in my room, and trays of Turkish delight and fresh pastries that tempted me each time I passed through the lobby. Complimentary cherry (yum!) and orange juice was also available in the lobby and the juice and tea/coffee facilities from the breakfast buffet remain available to guests on the roof terrace throughout the day. I arrived after a long journey and was immediately offered a cold drink to refresh me, which was thoughtful. Breakfast was perfectly adequate (try the hot chocolate from the Nescafe machine - yum!) but the food itself is far surpassed by the spectacular roof terrace, which has 360 degree views of the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sofia and Sea of Marmara. Being up on the terrace at sunset with the calls to prayer from the surrounding mosques ringing in the air is truly memorable. There is also a bar on the roof at which, during my stay, I met several people who were staying at nearby hotels and who had spotted it and wanted to come over as it looked much nicer than the terraces where they were staying! The Ferman hotel is located around the corner from a street full of restaurants which cater to tourists - the tables spill out onto the pavement and make for a festive atmosphere. You can get a decent, basic meal for around 20 lira (excluding alcoholic drinks which are pretty steep - mojitos at one place were 25 lira each!). You can also easily arrange a hotel shuttle (10 lira) from the travel shops in the area - they will also arrange tours for you, or ask at Reception and the Ferman staff will happily do the same. The Blue Mosque and Hagia Sofia are about a 5 min walk away, with the Topkapi Palace just a few minutes further. It takes less than 10 min to walk to the Sultanahmet tram station which connects you to the rest of the city. It is also possible to walk to the Grand Bazaar in about 15 min (wear comfy shoes though - Istanbul is hilly and many of the roads are cobbled). There are also several mini-markets near the hotel if you want to stock up on basics like water and confectionery. The Sultanahmet area seems to be very safe - as a woman on my own I had no problem walking around at night - other than fending off entreaties from ardent shopowners to come and see their carpets/leather goods/other! :-) My only complaint was that my room was not very soundproof - being off the lobby, there was quite a bit of noise as people came and went . Also, I could hear people walking around (the floors are not carpeted) and a baby crying in the room above me - and people in the next room talking loudly at 2.30am. Funnily enough, the noise from the trains that run on the track behind the hotel did not bother me at all (easier to tune out?). I did ask to be moved but the hotel was fully booked - the staff were very apologetic that they were unable to move me. I would definitely stay at the Ferman again though - I'd just request a quieter room. It is excellent value for money (pay in cash and you get 10% off your bill) and I would highly recommend it.", "Date": "October 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cThe biggest bang for your buck!\u201d", "Author": "kazbek99", "ReviewID": "UR47384899", "Content": "My brother and me stood in Ferman Hotel in October 2009 for 5 days.

The breakfast included with the room price was very good. It was served on the rooftop of the hotel overlooking the many wonderful sights of the city. However, what really made the hotel special was the wonderful staff. They were so courteous and helpful and answered all of our questions. They went above and beyond what would have been expected. As a specific example, we were in our hotel room for less than one-half hour when my husband realized that he did not have his wallet. He checked all of his pockets, backpack and luggage. He remembered that he had the wallet in the taxi that brought us from the airport to the hotel. He went to the front desk and spoke with the Front Office manager, Sinan Erdogan. Sinan said that he would have the shuttle driver take my husband back to the airport to check for the taxi and its driver to see if the wallet had been found. I remembered a portion of the license number of the taxi (written on the side of the cab as well as on the license plate.) The shuttle driver and my husband went back to the airport and asked at the taxi stand about the specific cab. The number was checked and the taxi people started broadcasting for the driver to check in. The shuttle driver was going to have to stay at the airport to bring back some other guests arriving from England later that evening. Right before my husband was going to take another cab back to the hotel, the taxi driver came back to the airport. The wallet had slipped down between the front seat cushions. As soon as it was found, my husband asked the shuttle driver to call back to the hotel to tell Sinan that he had found the wallet. Sinan called me in our room to report that all had turned out well. Needless to say, our trip was much better after that.

A case in point with regard to the top class level of service shown to us, was that having first arrived at the hotel in the late evening we were unable to change our money into Turkish Lira as the Bureau de Change was closed (don't change money at the airport as they charge 4% commission, better to do it in the old town where it is commission free). The dutiful and ever efficient front desk staff member, namely Sinan Erdogan, told us not to worry and produced 250 Turkish Lira from his own wallet and said that we could give it back to him whenever we changed our cash, which allowed us to shop in the local bazaar (it is open quite late) and buy something to eat that evening. This trust and understanding of the staff occurred throughout our stay so that whenever we needed a restaurant to be reserved or un-biased local knowledge of places to see and things to do, there was always someone on hand 24 hrs a day to help us. I have stayed in many top hotels in cities all around the world but found this level of personal service to be quite unique.

It's called \"Sofa Cafe\" its good food and it won't break the bank- you can eat in or take out- we decided to take the food back to our hotel one afternoon and eat in on the balcony whilst enjoying the beautiful views -it was lovely. -previous trip advisors have stated that there is a tram station nearby- I am a light sleeper and i slept like a baby on a very comfy bed, i didn't hear anything- so don't be worried about that. - I recommend going on to the roof top tearrace or on your balcony to hear the \"azaan\" ( call to prayer) It truley is a magical experience Istanbul is an amazing city and staying at this hotel ensured a perfect stay.

I should add that rooms are facilitated by a nice aircon. system which is totally under your control. It is possible to change the mode to \"cool\" or \"warm\", change the temperature and adjust the fan by a remote control exists in each room so you dont need to open the windows. the bed was comfortable. Each bed has four pillows; Two big and two small. Bathroom is realy clean and spotless, facilitated by a good size bathtub, high pressure shower and a telephone. The only drawback about rooms is that you can hear the sound of fan and water from your neighbours bathroom. Although nothing can be heared from next rooms (TV, speaking etc.) only bathroom. Staff: are realy helpful. You just ask and you will have what you have asked for. If you needed anything please ask Sinan. He will do his best to provide you with that.

The check out time of the hotel was noon 12 PM . Our luggage was left in the reception area. Because my hubby needed to use the internet, without any doubt, Sinan, who had the same name as a famous Turkish architect, (I think he, who had an artistic hair-do, is the chief executive!) opened a new, spare room for my hubby to use the internet until the car picked us up to go to the airport in the night time. We deeply appreciated his kind generosity! We strongly recommend someone who wants to pay a reasonable price for comfy accommodation as well as being so close to famous tourist spots. This is the place !", "Date": "May 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sao Paulo", "Title": "\u201cA PERFECT HOTEL\u201d", "Author": "mercilia", "ReviewID": "UR29405555", "Content": "We had just returned from Ferman Hotel and all I can tell you is that it was one of the best hotels I ever stayed.The staff (Ece, Sinan and Murad) are wonderful and made all efforts to make us at home.

This was are first visit to Istanbul so the location of the hotel couldn't be any better for the first time travellers. The room was clean and spacious with brilliant decor. The hotel like others have mentioned has small adjustment to be made however this shouldn't hold anyone back from booking it. The breakfast room is in the basement and yes its a little boring but its continental breakfast and this is how all continental breakfast taste, but when they finish the rooftop terrace i think it will be up lifting the breakfast with some amazing views of Istanbul. The staff at Ferman hotel likes of SInan (Duty Manager) Ece, Adnan and anyone else that we have forgot the names of have been fantastic. They have made shored that we have a great time at their Hotel and in Istanbul. Guys we will be back...... Overall i would recommend this hotel to all friends and family.", "Date": "April 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Johannesburg, South Africa", "Title": "\u201cNice boutique hotel with some teething problems\u201d", "Author": "PaulJohannesburg", "ReviewID": "UR28278559", "Content": "The hotel is well decorated and well located. Room finishing is also good with comfortable beds and nice linen. Breakfast is served in the \"basement\" in a partially unfinished room and is only OK but nothing special. The close proximity of the railway line can also be noisy for \"ocean view\" rooms. Some teething problems: 1) No instructions in room on how to set the code on the safe, what number to dial for reception etc. 2) Although the staff at reception is very friendly they are not always helpful - I think the English language barrier is a problem. 3) Toilet paper and toiletries always seemed to be in short supply and not always replaced. 4) No hot water in bathroom one morning - had a cold shower at 06:00 before leaving for an Ephesus day trip. 5) Motion sensor lights in passages are annoying as the delay is too short. 6) Room key card not available on arrival and not working when first issued. 7) Numerous requests to repair leaking toilet.

I got ill one night eating some excotic appetizer (not at the hotel!) and everyone made sure I had everything needed in these dire circumstances! The terrace was still under construction but it was rather cool during our stay so we did not miss it. The site which I used to book the hotel, had included a bar in the descpription. It did not exist but they were some nice bars within one minute walk with views over the Bosporus.
