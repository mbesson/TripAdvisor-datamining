The hotel is actually an intermediate lot of a high rise 'shophouse' (land is scarce in Singapore!). It's quite a small narrow hotel. The reception was good & there was 3-4 computers nearby for paid Internet. No free Wifi here. The interior deco of the hotel was chic stylish. Outside looks plain though. I stayed in a double bedroom. No windows, the room was small but very clean & modern with a flat screen TV hanging above. Coffee & tea provided. I can't remember if there was a minibar. For the money we paid (if i remembered correctly <$90/night) it was well worth it. Breakfast was provided (2 coupons for each room). Breakfast was basic Chinese style fried rice or fried noodle + toast bread with margarine & sausages. The breakfast menu rotates each day. Rooms cleaned everyday & the staff (reception & cleaners) are friendly. 1-2 of them were from Sarawak (my home). Location wise it is good located close to Bugis Street (a shopping place, lots of souvenirs to bring back home). Eating out was cheap as there were many hawkers centres nearby, I had a Char Siu Rice (Pork rice) for only $2 (RM4.80)! This is cheaper than Malaysia, minimum RM5. There are many places to sample food in all 4 directions. In a nutshell, this hotel is really worth 100% your money spent. It's clean & cosy & sleep was good although I could hear some conversation for a short duration(at 'low volume'). I definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Singapore.

When you book a hotel under 'The Fragrance' brand you already know it is budget and expect the service and facilities accordingly. However on this occasion I was dissapointed. The only redeming feature about this hotel is its location. Knowing beforehand about this hotel having so few rooms with a window, I contacted the Reservations office and asked for one to be reserved. Despite having a print out of the email confirmation confirming that one had been reserved, they had none left - the explanation being that the Reservations Office had not passed the email on. Whether this is true or not I don't know. I have stayed in windowless rooms before but try to avoid it as it resembles being in a tomb. Even though I'm only really using the room for sleeping, I still don't really like it. The room whilst clean was cramped, the hot water lasted about a minute before it went cold. The wifi was almost useless and the bed gave me back ache. The staff whilst pleasant weren't really interested in anything. The free breakfast was okay but I was already bored after the third day. I would not stay here again and if you want a budget hotel under the same brand or price range opt for Fragrance Imperial, one MRT stop away or a 10 minute bus ride.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Christchurch, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cGood location - tiny room\u201d", "Author": "Thanh N", "ReviewID": "UR119534483", "Content": "On a tight budget, this is a good place to stay. The room is really small, won't be any good for people with lots of luggage. The bathroom is in ok size, would be nice if there is shower curtain so the water won't be everywhere after someone have a shower. There's no fridge in the room, but there's a kettle and a good size TV. In the first room they gave us, the A/C was really noisy, so they moved us to another room. The AC in this room works fine but the bathroom was mouldy and had lots of tiny flies. We told them about the problems, they sent staffs to check and said it was fine to stay. We were a bit tired after 14hrs flying so it was ok to stay. Don't expect any thing good from their buffet breakfast. These were on offer: fried rice or noodle, fried spring roll, boiled (?) sausages and bread with jam. The coffee and tea were yuck. Most of the people, including us, walked out of the restaurant after 5mins. Not too sure about quality of the (paid) lunch or dinner. We didn't try. Internet is a rip off. $5 per 2 hours and once you start using, the clock will start ticking; stop using? it will continue counting until the time is passed. They offered free wifi for booking at their website, not over 3rd party. The staffs were very friendly and helpful though.

If you are a type of person who needs only a place to sleep at night when visiting Singapore then this hotel may be for you. I find the rooms clean although only a handful of rooms have a window because of the structure of the building (sandwhiched between two buildings). Rooms in front will give you a view of middle street and adjacent properties, rooms at the back will give you a view of buildings at the back of the hotel. You may want to find out from the hotel if they can assign you a room with a window before finalizing your reservation -- if it is important to you. The two rooms that has windows that were assigned to us only has a bed good for two persons. Location is convenient, if you need something a 7-Eleven convenience store can be located at the ground floor of the building. It is quite near to the Bugis area (~5 minutes walk) where you can hop to the MRT to go to other parts of Singapore or to do shopping at Bugis Market or Bugis Junction. Breakfast is complimentary, you will be given vouchers when you check-in. You have a choice of sausage, toast, asian noodles, steamed egg in the buffet line. If you are not a fan of these, I would recommend that you head to Bugis Junction where there is a food court on your way to the MRT to have other local choices such as Kaya Toast and Nasi Lemak. For those whose hands are tied to the internet, you must note that internet is not complimentary and you must purchase hours in order to access the internet. For groups of 5-7 heading to the Airport, a van is available to you at 45 SGD.", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cBudget Motel !!!\u201d", "Author": "Michael W", "ReviewID": "UR119280662", "Content": "We Knew this was a budget hotel, but it was awful.
