As a mater of fact I had one guy bring me an adaptor and he did not say a world! He simply handed me the adaptor (without smile) when I opened the door and did not even extend a greeting. Rooms - one bedroom apartment, ok but a bit dark and small. TV reception and sound not good for some channels. Housekeeping came at 6pm to clean the room and did not replace toilet tissues when empty. On checkout date just came into the room, saying 'ohh, I thought it is check out'. Breakfast average an overstatement. No wifi available in the rooms. Big minus for travelers nowadays. For me... Been there, done that!

Breakfast was not included in our package, but because of the small kitchen and the nearby supermarket it is easy to stay here on a budget (in Dubai terms). Staff was very helpfull and the room was very clean. The only downside of the hotel is the 'travel agency'. Their desert safari and their trip to Abu Dhabi were very dissappointing. For way too much money they bring you in Abu Dhabi to a heritage village, which has the feel of a very cheap theme park, and to some buildings you can see from a distance. The only good thing about the Abu Dhabi trip is the mosque, which is not to be missed, but make sure are there at the right time so you can also take a free guided tour. For the desert safari they made us pay Dhs 250 instead of the Dhs 120-150 that most operators were offering, because this operator was supposed to be much better. But we couldn't understand how this safari could have been any worse. The camel ride was a 10 meter ride on the one camel at the camp that we had to share with two hundred other people. The other activities were sand boarding (two broken boards on a 5 meter dune), Tanura show (one guy, 5 mins.), belly dancing (one woman, 10 mins.), Henna painting (one) and Shisha (one you had to share with again 200 people). The free drinks were low budget sodas and tea (no coffee) and the BBQ buffet dinner was poor.", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cSuperb Clean New Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Charles S", "ReviewID": "UR124142698", "Content": "Just recently returned from this hotel and it sure met all my expectations. I've been to Dubai a few times but i needed to stay at TECOM which is the business hub of Dubai.

If that was an upgrade i cringe to know what its like in the standard rooms. The shower is cold and water trickles even when we switched it to the hottest and high vol. The elevators were slow . Receptionist & Bellboys are not attentive. We called more than a dozen time from the room and no one even bothered to pick up the call. There was 1 staff on duty during our group check out . It is within walking distance to the Internet City monorail station. That's the only thing good about the locality. Otherwise its far from the malls & everything else.

On the last day we called for a bell boy 4 times, they said they were coming and then never came. After an hour we took our 8 bags down ourself, only to find 3 bellboys at the stand.

The location is ideal, round the corner from the amazing metro station in TECOM so you can travel very easily at a very cheap price. Quite busy location but this hotel is located in a quite part of town and from the room it was silent which was heaven. The view from the swimming pool and gym is simply stunning, you can see so far and you sure wouldn't get bored sunbathing next to the pool, working out in the gym or even eating at the restaurant at the same floor with those stunning views. I've been to the very good 5 star Le Royal Meridian in Jumeirah 5 years ago but if you want to stay at a place where you want to drop your stuff off and go sight seeing, business meetings etc then this homely feel hotel is perfect. I came here for business with my wife and it ticked every box from the quality of the room to the high class service which met my every request.
