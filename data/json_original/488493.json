It's an extremely outdated place. The room was small...there were maybe 3 inches of space between the wall and the bed on all sides of the room except the small area in front of the bathroom. Everything in the room was clearly very old..the carpet, the bedding, the heater....easily from the 60s or 70s. But I didn't go to Chicago to stay in a hotel...I just needed somewhere to sleep and it served that purpose. It was at least clean.

In an attempt to save our company a little coin, my colleague and I booked our stay at the Chinatown Hotel. We thought we would give it the old college try and maybe discover a hidden gem. Wrong. Things to know about the Chinatown Hotel: 1) They DO NOT accept American Express as payment, but you can book your hotel with an American Express. Bring another form of payment, which is due in full when you check IN; 2) There's no elevator, but there is a very narrow staircase. Pack light, and small; 3) The parking situation is two blocks away. If traveling by car, check in first, then park so you don't have to lug your luggage through Chinatown. Also, being a single female, and traveling with another female, I don't reccomend this place for females. I really don't reccomend it for anyone, but I think men have less discriminating tastes than women. It is definitely more like a hostel. So, if you're young, male, and don't care where you sleep, stay here. If however, you have the budget, have traveled quite a bit, and have a general concern for your health and safety, DO NOT stay here. I will say the staff on duty was very accomodating when my colleague and I decided to check out immediately after checking in. No questions, no hassle. So, that was a bonus. I highly reccomend visiting Chinatown when you're in Chicago, just stay somewhere else in the city.", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Detroit, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cTerrible\u201d", "Author": "ed s", "ReviewID": "UR119569453", "Content": "Terrible!!!

Clearly the operators of the Chinatown Hotel do the minimum and little else. I rented a \"suite\" for myself and a friend, and even a very experienced traveler like myself was surprised to find such a dilapadated room. Truly it was laughable. Both cabinets in my room were broken and falling apart. The one holding the telephone was collapsing on all sides. My bed was tilted toward the floor which made for an easier entry out of the door! My friends, I have had better accomodations in Quito for $10.00 a night. The best part of the hotel is its Chinatown location: cheap and good cafes abound, and the \"L\" stop is two blocks away. And my final comment is, you doubt me? Well, I have never had a room lock itself from the inside! The additional locking system they have is a small swinging bar that closes upon a metal stem. Due to the loose screws the bar placed itself unto the stem. There was just enough space to insert a small tool and push the bar out of the way.

The only major downsides were no bedside lamp and only like 6 tv channels 2 of which were not in English. But this was really not too big a deal as we spent most of the trip out n about. The shower wasnt the greatest cause it had the detachable head and I personally hate those cause they seem to severely decrease water pressure. Also they had soft water which I am not too fond of and the provided shampoo was a 2 in 1 with conditioner. There is a coffee maker in the room which doesnt come with any coffee but they do make coffee for the guests in the lobby which is pretty good.

If you're looking to be pampered, or you want to impress that special someone in your life, you're definetly barking up the wrong tree.", "Date": "June 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bay Area", "Title": "\u201cHorrible, disgusting roach motel\u201d", "Author": "romi_G", "ReviewID": "UR41953027", "Content": "Yes, we had roaches.

A nice hotel, or a convinient place to rest\u201d", "Author": "Pinernator", "ReviewID": "UR21905821", "Content": "We are a family owned company, and I had a tight budget to run an exhibit at the McCormick center...so we chose the Cinatown Hotel Sro. You will find some helpful advice below. 1) Location, Location a) We stayed at the Chinatown Sro Hotel for a week (7 days). There is no \"hotel parking\" so if you brought a car, you will be paying $10 a night to park in a supervised parking lot (a 2 min walk). You can however unload and load your car for 10 min outside the hotel. b) The hotel is less than a 3 min walk from the Red line train station Cermak/Chinatown. You can get on just about any other train to get anywhere you want from here. Fares are $2 each, and only 25c when you ride another train within 2 hrs. c) Excellent food. You can smell Chinatown before you see it. It smells like sweet and sour chicken and beer. My advice is to go for the resturants with the most god-awful gawdy lookings signs. King Wok is a good choice. Looks terrible on the outside, but upstairs you will be pleasantly surprised. Our theory was of they could afford the sign, they must have customers paying for it. You can also go just up the road to China square , which is a compound full of great resturants. Spoilt for choice. d) Lower crime rate. The Chinese generally look after their own neighborhood. I felt safer walking in Chinatown at night than in other \"dodgy\" areas of Chicago. e) 15 min walk to the McCormick center, you will save $20 a day in cab fares if you choose the healthy route. You can comprimise by grabbing a biscuit from the McDonalds along the way. 2) The Hotel a) Friendly staff. The staff do speak English, just be patient, and were quite hepful. You will need to request extra towels to be given everyday, as their towels are cheap and Chinese, and soak up very little. Also, you may want to request a second room heater in cold weather (see details further on). b) The room keys. I still have to figure out how these worked. They are like pieces of tin that slide into the door handles. I have never seen this system before. If you pay by cash there is a deposit required for the room key, but not if you pay by credit card. c) The hotel internet only works downstairs. \"Free wireless\" is a joke, and the manager sid that it was becuase his server was too small to handle over 10 users on at one time... why offer it ? d) This hotel was built for Chinese people. The foyer looks nice, but once in the stairwell or corridor it is another story. They are tiny. I had to contort my body to avoid hitting my head in the stairwells, and it is a real trick with luggage, as there is no elevator. Luckily we were on the first floor. 3) The Rooms a) VERY basic, I think I had more aminities in my Air Force barraks. The room view was a darn sight better than the two nasty alleys that these two windows fell open to. (I say fell, because neither worked correctly, and they both were very draughty when closed.... use your extra bath towels here!) b) Heat. (BYOSH) Bring your own space heater. Once is provided, but it is not enough. The hotel is draughty at night. Temps outside were about 32F, and it was pretty chilly inside. c) The beds are very small. I am 6'6\". 250lb, and a completely covered the twin bed. I could not move left or right and my feet stuck out 1 foot over the end of the bed. d) The bathroom. Do not place wet towels on the towel rack. The exessive weight will make it pop off the wall. The showerhead is held by a plastic clamp, and it cannot be positioned to wash your body. The shower nozzle can be removed, however. In cold temps make sure that you dry off while the shower door is shut. e)TV. You get 7 channels. 2 are so fuzzy they look like snow storms. 2 are in Spanish and 1 in Chinese. So you are left with CNN and ESPN. The bottom line - If you want a cheap hotel in Chicago, near the McCormick center and you are not going to be bringing your customers back to the place, stay at the Chinatown Sro. It will save you lots of money in the long run. The hotel also makes a super reason to get out. You do not want to stay in your room for anything else other than bathing and sleep and for these two activities, it works as good as any US Army barrack.", "Date": "November 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Louis, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cDecent.

Not much room to lay out yout toilette articles though. I write all of this as I didn't know what to expect based on the reviews and so I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the living area. It is an old place and it only has three floors and the caveate is that there is no elevator. My roon was on the seconf floor, but you had to climb stairs to get to the first floor. The room was clean and so other than the lights I have no complaints. The staff was friendly and all speak with a rather pronounced Chinese accent. Some more than others. I didn't really have a problem with it, but I can see where same might. The train station is a couple of blocks away. It is about a 15 min ride to the Mag. Mile. Only problem there is the red line was going through construction and so coming back later in the evening was a bit confusing as you couldn't take the usual stations to return.

We were out late one night and always felt safe - plenty of people around as many restaurtants are open 'til 2 a.m. The rooms and bathroom were always clean, with no smoke smell or bugs. Downstairs there was a refrigerator, microwave, and computer for internet access. We had two TVs which had the usual cable stations plus a variety of Chinese programming. Plus the hotel is only a few minutes walk from the red-line stop which is just one stop away from the Museum Campus. Of course, there is nothing fancy about the hotel. No elevator, we had to bring our own portable crib, the bathroom was small, and sometimes it took a few minutes to get the water warm for the baby's bottle. But it was an above average value considering we saved $200-300 over the next best priced hotel available.", "Date": "July 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arizona", "Title": "\u201cDirty Small Rooms/Convenient access to Downtown/Inexpensive price\u201d", "Author": "Peter32", "ReviewID": "UR3662302", "Content": "I stayed there 2 nights in July 2005. The night shift reception doesn't understand a word of English! The hotel is located near to rough areas of the city. It may not be safe to walk out after 11PM. But it's very convenient to use CTA red line trains to the middle of downtown. The CTA station is very near. If you have a car you need to pay 3.5$ each time you enter the parking that is located 3-5 minute walk from the hotel. The rooms are small & not clean. The toilet flash was almost broken. There was no ventilation in the bathroom. The second day, I saw a bug in the room! You need to go and borrow the hair dryer from the reception if you need it! There are 2 computers in the lobby to connect to internet. One was not working. The other was Ok, But not that good. There is a microwave to use in the lobby. There is no elevator and the stairs are not standard (very sharp). If you are on a limited budget, It's ok because of inexpensive price and convenient access to downtown.", "Date": "July 13, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cVery good location, very good value\u201d", "Author": "WorldTraveler000", "ReviewID": "UR3622489", "Content": "The hotel is located in the middle of Chinatown and is walking distance to many shops and restaurants; it is also on the busline and on the red CTA train line for easy commute to the airport. McCormick convention center is a 5 minute bus ride from the hotel or 20 minute walk. This is probably one of the closest hotels to the convention center for the best price. The rooms and bathrooms are small but clean and adequate. High speed internet access free in the room, as well as, in the lobby where there are several computers provided for customer use at no charge. There is no elevator, so be prepared to walk the stairs with your luggage. The hotel staff is very nice and accommodating.
