It is in a nice quiet area of the city, not many cars drive past your window and there are no clubs nearby to disturb your sleep. The staff are friendly and the reception staff speak english. I like this hotel as it's also a self contained flat with microwave and hob etc. I can't comment on the breakfast served here as usually cook myself or goto one of the many resturants in the city. The apartment is very big and has 3 bedrooms so good for big groups or just one person. They have satilite tv with about 400 channels (it took me a while channel hoping lol) but i only saw about 3 channels in english the rest turkish or arabic but you dont go on holiday to watch tv. Trams, buses and taxis are only a short walk away along with some resturants and a small shopping centre. I always enjoy my stay here and will be going back again.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cAlternative lodging in istanbul\u201d", "Author": "luv2travel16", "ReviewID": "UR119122531", "Content": "We chose this hotel because of its proximity to the airport. I was a little worried at first because the cab driver did not know where this hotel was located. When we finally arrived at the hotel, we were impressed at the size of our room...well its not just a room, it is actually an apartment with 3 bedrooms, a kitchen, 2 baths. We were able to get a good night sleep before our flight and take advantage of complimentary breakfast. I would have rated the baran 4 stars but i was disappointed at the service more like lack of service. There is usually no one at the front desk and we had to figure out on our own how to take a cab to the airport. Fortunaly there is a cab stand right down the street. This hotel is a good option for large groups because of the space and if you want to be near the airport. I would not recommend if you want to be close to Istambul's main attractions.", "Date": "October 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alcala De Henares, Spain", "Title": "\u201cconfortable stay\u201d", "Author": "dgviedma", "ReviewID": "UR117385333", "Content": "excellent place to stay with your family.
