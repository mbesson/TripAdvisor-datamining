Situated on the 2nd floor (no elevator), on a side street, it is barely 2 minutes away from Puerta del Sol and its metro station. Reservation by internet (in English) is possible; I received my answer within 24 hours for a single room without bathroom (their cheapest at 25 euros/night). On arrival, I was given my keys (room & front door), shown to my small (but comfortable) room very politely and indicated the bathroom and shower (further down the hall) as well as the living room where one could use a computer (a bit slow) free of charge during the day. My room, very clean, consisted of the usual: bed, table, cupboard, sink. It was right on the street and proved to be somewhat noisy until 11-12 p.m (earplugs are a must) and, in the morning, deliveries took place starting at 6 a.m. The two windows that opened on the small balconies (a bit dirty) had heavy doors to shut off the noise from the two squares nearby. Soap and shampoo as well as towels were provided and the last were changed daily during my stay. Beside the mirror over the sink, there was a blow-dryer. In addition, the room boasted of a small t.v. and a fan. The bed was a tad hard and the pillow a bit on the thin side but that is a matter of preference. The place turned out to be very convenient for visiting the city. Most sites were withing walkable distance (5-20 minutes). At the Mercado San Miguel, 5-minutes walk away, one could buy different kind of tapas and a glass of wine for supper. Note that there is a supermarket in the basement of the main Cort\u00e8s Ingl\u00e8s on Puerta del Sol.", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cWarm and friendly atmosphere plus great location!

Even though the room was small there was enough space and even an extra bed in the room. There was airconditioning, TV and a beautiful view from the balcony. The bathroom was again very clean and we were provided with fresh clean towels every day. The hostel is in a great location, right near the Plaza Mayor and Puerta De Sol.

Really good location, only about 20 seconds walk from puerto del sol. Staff really helpful and as we were not leaving for the airport until 1600 hours they kept our cases until then so we could still chill out in the city. The maps you see are very deceiving and it appears that it is further away than it is but it really isn't. When you come out of the metro (at SOL) look towards Mcdonalds and then walk up the road to the right hand side of McDonalds (Calle Esperatos) about 50 metres and it is on the right (really small sign you will miss it). There are 2 flights of stairs to go up but well worth it.

On top of that, the owners are very nice people who will help you with anything you need. As for breakfast, just go down to the street and cross to the other side. 20 meters down the street there's a place called demontaditos, where you can grab a great breakfast for a very good price.

Be prepared to carry your suitcases up two flights of stairs to get to the tiny lobby. There is no elevator (as of yet). The husband and wife who run the hostal are very sweet and helpful, but speak only Spanish. While we were there, all rooms were booked, and they had to turn away a number of travelers looking for an inexpensive place to stay. This friendly mom-and-pop hostal reminds me of the pensions or guest houses in France and Portugal. The room we had was tiny and cozy but the space was used efficiently, the twin beds were comfortable, the bathroom had a small bathtub/shower and good towels. There was a small flat screen TV, but I could not figure out how to make it work. Most importantly, everything was very clean and there was no smoking allowed. There was an old computer in the lobby with a very temperamental keyboard and slow (but free) internet access but no printer. There are some locuterios nearby where one can use the internet or make phone calls. As expected in this very central location, noise is a big problem. The room looked out over a side street with lots of foot traffic that did not stop until 2 or 3 a.m. Sounds of people walking and talking echoed through the streets. Stores and restaurants shuttering their metal roll-down doors added to this noise. Trash trucks came around 4 am, and building renovation workers began very early (around 6 a.m.). The walls were thin and I could hear other guests talking and more ; ) Definitely bring your ear plugs.

I was peomised there would be a room when I returned but found it didn't have a shower and was very small, basically a narrow wedge with just enough room for bed and wardrobe. I was in this two nights then transferred to a room with a shower. This wasn't a good move as the shower was literally in the room, about 18\" from the side of the bed and the room was no larger than the one I'd had the previous two nights. On the positive side, this room had air-con and this meant I could close both sets of shutters which cut down on street noise considerably. On the positive side, the hostal was kept immaculately clean, the owners were very friendly and apologetic for the mix up and it is centrally positioned, albeit in a very noisy thoroughfare.
