We made the reservation 3 weeks before going there and \"re\"confirmed 3 days before. They send us a confirmation email for our room. When we arrived there THEY HAD NO ROOM FOR US!!!!! They had a huge pile of dossier of person with reservation and no room. We had to spend the night in the train station. We saw a family of 5 person with elder and child having to go on the streets of London at 11:30 PM to find a room (impossible task in London in July!!) This family had already paid for the room... so... NO COMMENT... Last but not least, the person attending during this night seemed to find it funny that they had so many person with reservation and having paid a room! We have no words to say how outraged we were. They should be ashamed.", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norwich, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAVOID!!

The people at the front of the queue were told they would be staying at another hotel miles away in Muswell Hill as the hotel was full despite them having pre booked. When we got served we were told the same thing, the guy on the desk was grinning when he was telling people without a care in the world and being incredibly rude with no apology whatsoever. When we questioned him about it he became even more rude refusing to even show us on a map where this over hotel would be. It turned out everyone in reception area with their luggage was waiting for minibuses to ferry them to different hotels. The hotel we were sent to was miles away from where we needed to be costing us extra expense in travel though the staff there were at least helpful and friendly. The next day over breakfast I was told by a member of staff at the hotel that Central Park Hotel purposely overbook by around 50 people a day and had been for nearly 3 years now. Guests think they are staying in Finsbury Park but are sent over to hotels when they arrive, he was shocked it was happening and told me that 8 other guests had also stayed there that night who had booked in at the Central Park Hotel and this was a regular occurrence. I think it is disgusting this is happening and would urge people to avoid booking at the Central Park Hotel as you will be sent to another hotel miles away, spoken to rudely and left very disappointed!!", "Date": "May 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWorst place I have ever stayed at!\u201d", "Author": "guru_fordy", "ReviewID": "UR66896721", "Content": "Okay so I had a twin room on the top floor.

I noticed a review that indicated payment of 25 pounds per night and we paid more than three times that! How were we to know that there are 2 Central Park Hotels! The elevator (lift) was not in working order and we had 2 full suitcases each, plus hand-luggage because we had just come off of a 15 day cruise. I feel sorry for anyone staying in the room beneath ours because the floor squeaked horribly with every step. The curtains on one window were coming down and did not close completely. The first day we had both hand towels and bath towels; after that we only got bath towels. The bed linens were clean and fresh, but consisted of only a bottom sheet and duvet with cover. The first night was quite warm, so we took the cover off the duvet and used the cover as a top sheet. The bathroom was tiny but clean - and sadly in need of an upgrade - but there was no place to put anything! No hair dryer, and I didn't realize that we could have borrowed one from the front office until I happened to see someone return one on the final day of our stay. There were no water glasses in the bathroom or room, but the night registration desk clerk got us 2 when requested. The next morning, when I asked for 1 more, the dining room attendant rudely addressed my request noting there are not enough for everyone to have a glass. Excuse me! If this location is going to advertise as a hotel, then water glasses in the room is a very minor amenity they should provide - along with hand towels. Desk clerks were very friendly and helpful and even loaned us a converter so we could charge our camera batteries. As with other reviewers, I agree that it is conveniently within minutes walking distance to bus or tube transportation. Free internet was nice. As for noise level at night, weekends were very noisy during the late hours; the week-day nights were quiet. Be aware that this location is more of a hostel than a hotel, and not worth what we paid for the accommodation.", "Date": "May 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wirral", "Title": "\u201cVERY cheap but cheerful enough\u201d", "Author": "GinaG1983", "ReviewID": "UR21459708", "Content": "This hotel was basically picked as it is close to where my sister lives which was the reason for my visit....

For my \u00c2\u00a325 a night i got to park my car in a safe area (very rare in London), i was 3 minutes from tube - which was 10 minutes from central London, breakfast and ensuite bathroom. Staff - especially lady who did breakfast were a bit lacking in charm but guys on reception always said hello. Curtains didnt fit window and drains smelt slightly but we had fresh towels everyday and as we were out sight seeing it was more than bareable for a long weekend.
