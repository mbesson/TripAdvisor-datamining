Got it! Arrived early in the morning to this first floor establishment located on the Kur'Damm, offered coffee, and was promptly escorted to my room, which was actually a suite of a foyer/dressing room, full bathroom and double bed (American-sized full bed). The atmosphere reminds me of a c. 1920's house with several guest rooms. The breakfast room was really more of a parlor, with comfortable wingback chairs and rich tapestries. My room (#18) had a large bathtub, modern bathroom, and overlooked a courtyard full of bicycles and trees with birds. No cars. The bed was comfortable - but it does feel like you are sleeping in someone's home - furniture is older, but clean and linens are crisp but not \"industrial\". There is a low-key vibe to the place - breakfast is served at YOUR leisure, and rooms are kept tidy. The hosts were all very gracious and made me (a single lady traveller) feel most welcome. The only drawback (and I am very hesitant to say this) was the loud guest in the room next to me, who spoke on his cell phone all day at the desk of his room, which was located next to his door. Good thing he was using a dialect of German I can't understand, or I might know his state secrets!

Our room was HUGE with a seperate glassed in sitting area with lovely views of the Ku'dam. The reception lady showed me some of the other larger rooms to help us choose for our next stay. It is tremendous value for a hotel of this style & loction. The staff are very helpful & kind. The hotel only has a small number of rooms so you feel like a house guest. There is a small bar in the corner of the breakfast room but we didn't use it. Two things I would suggest to improve the experience even more - 1) Tea/coffee making facilities in the room 2) Soft music playing at breakfast, Baroque by a German composer would be nice. I loved this hotel & will return. Many famous people have stayed here, including David Bowie & Arthur Miler. I would hate to see it over-restrored or modernised in any way.

The room was delightfully decorated in blue and comfortably furnished. It had a separate sitting room overlooking Kurf\u00fcrstendamm and separated from the sleeping area by a glass screen and doors, plus shutters. This meant that the room was completely quiet at night and we slept very well in the comfortable bed on all 3 nights of our stay. The bathroom was adequate with shower, basin and WC and ample toiletries. Towels were on the small size but adequate. Breakfast was great! We loved the ornate dining room with so many interesting things to look at. It seems the hotel has a long history of accommodating actors and actresses performing in nearby theaters and there are many signed photos adorning the walls. Breakfast was an extensive European buffet style with the pleasant servers providing choices of freshly cooked eggs and hot beverages. On a couple of occasions we ate at 6.30 am and even at this hour the service was good! If you like to read there are books everywhere! And the hotel is pleased to allow book exchange for novels etc. There are also lots of reference/travel books including many for Berlin itself.

On pointing out that we'd specifically booked a double we were told the hotel was full that night so they could not do anything but that for the remaining 2 nights of our stay they would transfer us to a luxury room (12) at no extra charge (this still had twin beds pushed together but in one big frame this time). Both rooms were spacious (12 was positively huge), spotlessly clean and stylishly decorated, with chandeliers, and had sparkling modern bathrooms with good showers. Both overlooked the Ku'damm but due to good double glazing noise wasn't a problem - traffic was just about audible but not at a level to disturb, and for such a famous street at night it really wasn't busy. The hotel has some rooms opening directly off the lobby, including 12 - we were slightly concerned about this but in fact there were internal sliding doors behind the lobby door, to increase privacy and reduce noise from outside. Breakfast was very good - a choice of cereals, yoghurt, baked goods, preserves etc. and fresh coffee, eggs freshly prepared, with a choice of cold meats, cheese etc. Another advantage to this hotel is how easy it is to get to from Tegel airport - the 109 bus from the airport takes you almost to the front door in 30 minutes for 2.9 Euros - don't bother trying to get there any other way!

Our only real problem was initially finding it. The Hotel is on is a typically big, wide Berlin Street, and, despite the appearance of a big sign in the photos section of Trip Advisor, the sign is small from the street. Our cab driver missed it on the first try. We dragged our bags from the cab to the door, and found the buzzer that rang the Hotel, which is on the 2nd floor of this very large 100-year old building. There is a small elevator, and with the help of one of the Hotel staff, we got our bags off the street and into the lobby. This is a small hotel, with a small staff, so you should not expect people swirling around your cab on arrival to help you with bags. Once they knew you were there though, help was easily available. We had arrived in the morning after our overnight flight from the USA. We had requested early check-in, and thankfully the hotel was able to honor that request. In fact they had a choice for us, a room overlooking the courtyard and a larger room overlooking the street. We elected the courtyard room, as we wanted to open our bedroom windows at night and was concerned about the street noise. The courtyard room was very quiet and we were glad we made that choice. Due to allergies with feather bedding, we had requested synthetic bedding. The hotel maid (which was the same person who had helped us with our bags on the street) had fulfilled that request the night before - which in our experience is a rarity. We normally have to ask 2-3 times to get this done. Our room was spacious and very clean. We asked for robes, which were provided. The in-room hotel WiFi worked great. As with almost every European Hotel, there are no wash cloths in the bathroom, so bring them if you want them. Breakfast was served in the morning all the way to 11am, which was great for us late sleepers. The breakfast room was a sight to behold (see the pictures), and the 3-minute eggs were served with a hilarious egg warmer coat. We grew to absolutely love them. There is also a bar in the breakfast room that is tended to by the front desk clerk in the evening. We found it much cheaper to buy a typically very good five-euro bottle of Bordeaux at the nearby supermarket for our room. The hotel is about a 10-minute walk to the nearest S-Bahn station (Savignyplatz). It is about a 20-minute walk the \"Zoo\" station. If you are there on the weekend, don't miss the flea market near the Tiergarten Station. The Savignyplatz S-Bahn station is a stopping point for the train to Potsdam, something also not to be missed. We were prepared to do a lot of walking, so the hotel's location of being slightly away from things did not bother us. There is a taxi assembly area immediately outside the hotel. We used it once when it was raining to get us to the Zoo Station. Plenty of restaurants around the area. Our favorite was P12 Restaurant & Bar on nearby Mommsenstra\u00dfe. On departure we had planned to take our bags to the Savignyplatz station, as we were leaving by train from Berlin's beautiful new Main Train Station. This train station is only about 4 stops from Savignyplatz. But Savignyplatz had no elevators to get bags up to a very elevated train station. The hotel arranged for a cab, as it was Sunday morning. This was the first time we had not seen a cab at the outside taxi waiting point. All in all we would return to Askanisher Hof on our next Berlin trip.

The location is excellent - right on the Kufurstendam in the Charlottenburg district in a very up-market area with plenty of shops, food and transport to access any area in Berlin relatively easily. The hotel is on the first floor of the building and you just buzz reception from the main entrance 24 hours a day and they will let you in. Remember, this is not your typical \"brand name\" hotel. You won't find 24 hour room service, pool and valet service but you will find it personalised, small and oozing character. The room we had was just lovely - extremely clean and just a bit different. The furnishings were lovely. The room faced away from the main street. It was also of a good size. There was some construction works being undertaken on the facade of the building as well as the exterior of the rear of the building which meant no sleeping in - they started noisily at 7.00am. This did not bother us as we wanted to make the most of each day but we were not advised of any construction works at the time of booking. There was no air-conditioning but the room was relatively cool with the windows open (the weather during our stay was a mixed bag of fine, sometimes warm but also sometimes cool with light rain at times, temps around the low 20's) The entire staff were excellent and assisted in anyway possible to make your stay a great one. They all spoke very good English. We even asked them to book a restaurant for us that we wanted to go to and they willingly obliged. When we said \"Do you want our name\", the reply was \" I know your name!\" - how often do you get that! The breakfast was excellent with a wide selection of fruits, yoghurts, pastries and meats and cheeses as well as hard boiled and scrambled eggs. The breakfast room is just delightful - reminiscent of a bygone era! There was free WiFi connection which was fast and reliable. We will definately return to Berlin - a great city with so much to do.

Rather than choose the rather expensive city centre chain-hotels option I read the reviews on Trip Advisor for Askanischer Hof and checked out their own website for pictures and further info, to discover that this would be something memorable without paying silly money (about \u00a390/120Euros per night for B&B). One warning about flying Easyjet is that Schoenfeld is a fair bit out of the city. Although I'm sure there are bus and train options we just wanted to get to our hotel so got a cab, which cost over 40Euros. Once we got to the hotel it was immediately clear that this was something different. 15 rooms spread over the first floor of what looks from the front like a nice office building.. Once inside you immediately step back 100 years, with traditional decor and loads of memorabilia in the hotel reception. The reception is small but the staff very friendly and willing to assist. Quietly helpful best describes them. Also very safe because there's someone on reception 24hrs and you have to buzz-in every time you enter the building (even when you stoat home at 4am after a cracking night out at Berlin Club Felix!). Our room was opposite reception next to the breakfast room and everything about it was great other than the bed. A huge room done out in old-fashioned styling (even with a traditional radio that picked up loads of random stations!), but with a really small and a bit uncomfortable double bed. That was my only criticism as a lovely big double bed in the room would have topped off a great hotel room. Hotel is right in amongst the designer shops area of Ku'Damm where there are clearly many Berlin residents with lots of money. You need to walk to the left as you exit the hotel to reach the more mainstream shops and restaurants. And talking of restaurants the best bit of advice I can give is that there is an Italian restaurant just along the road towards the main shopping area, called Petrocellis. Run by Italians and superb food and wine, with a great atmosphere.

When we walked into the room just like from when we walked into the hotel we were stunned. I knew I had arrived in an authentic Germany with authentic style. Right down to the old style radio, the lights and the sofa. It was such an amazing experience. A lot of reviews mention the breakfast. I looked forward to breakfast every morning. You have a range of choice such as cereals, (I assume it is custom for German people to have) meats and cheese, basket of bread and the good old egg. Maybe others didn't realise but you have the choice of freshly boiled, fried or my favourite scrambled egg. I loved how the breakfast waitress knew in the mornings I would like scrambed egg and some lovely coffee. The breakfast room in itself is an experience, the decor is so original and some of the big chairs...well I felt like a king. We took the opportunity during our stay to have a few sneaky peeks at some of the other rooms whilst they were vacant and open for airing. They were all amazing and no two rooms I seen were the same.

From the moment you ring the front door bell you enter an old world of charm and quiet. We stayed for three nights in a suite. Loved having breakfast served in the room overlooking the little inner courtyard. The staff were helpful friendly and unobtrusive. There are many nice restaurants close by. If designer shopping is your thing you are surrounded by high end shops. One tip for visiting the Reichstag book tea or lunch to avoid the queue. The staff at the hotel have the number and made the reservation for us.", "Date": "January 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201c1st Class\u201d", "Author": "Cantonaisgod", "ReviewID": "UR6484550", "Content": "This is just a great place to stay. Our double room was spacious, spotlessly clean, with lots of hot water and a power shower. We were facing onto Ku'damm (West Berlin's principal shopping street), but the room had a conservatory (!) between the bedroom and the on-street windows and so we were completely oblivious of any road noise. Breakfasts are ample and served in a wonderfully eclectic room in which Sally Bowles might have held court. The staff are unfussy, but very friendly and extremely helpful. The hotel is on the bus route from Tegel airport (nearest stop 200m ), between two U-Bahn stops (for lines U1 and U2), and a short walk through an up-market residential area (with plenty of bars and restaurants) from Savigny-Platz S-Bahn station. So, with Berlin's excellent public transport system (a travel pass is a great buy), anywhere in the city can easily be reached day or night. Highly recommended.", "Date": "December 23, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Askanischer Hof", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d233866-Reviews-Askanischer_Hof-Berlin.html", "Price": "$118 - $1,325*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Kurfuerstendamm 53</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10707</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "233866", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/66/cb/66cb8374bc61869b42eb238aecd4d6103large.jpg"}}
