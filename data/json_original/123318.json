Location is great. But it really does end there, sadly. Roaches and Bedbugs are both present, luckily I was not bitten but I saw them. Bed was clean when I got there minus some stains on the sheets. I don't want to know what they were. But housekeeping did not come once after that for a week. It was quiet enough for the area and no problems but unless you can not afford anything better you might want to avoid this one until they take care of the bugs and clean it up a bit more. I've stayed in the past a few times and a few roaches I can deal with.

We needed a quick place and found it while driving by. Instincts (and common sense) told me not to stay there, but my friends would not listen. Everything else you read here is true. I also saw gay porn in the lobby, brown water coming from the sink, mirrors on the ceilings, crack heads and hookers roaming the halls. Our heater/radiator was broken, so they sent up some wierd guy with a wrench to try to fix it. As he left, the lock fell off my door. NONE of this is an exageration. I was afraid to even take a shower and freshen up (after 18 hours traveling by car) for our event. As soon as my friends were ready for the evening we checked out....did not even stay the night.

The halls smell atrocious, take a deep breath, tomorrow morning you will pray that the halls smelled this delightful. Blood stains and pubic hairs will be present, in the bed.

Look for Hanging mannequin heads and a pair of doves that laugh hysterically in the lobby, staffed by an assortment of quirky characters. I've been there, perhaps four times because I love the Belmont and Halstead location, but the appeal has worn thin. My last stay featured dirty sheets, full of hair and stains, something that was not remedied until the second day. I don't think the place has ever seen a vacuum and, though the rooms have AC units, the halls were unbelievably hot. At ninety bucks on weekends, it's not even that cheap. Persons with mental issues, transvestites and addicts seem to live in the joint; one time I saw a large naked man emerge from a hall closet and saunter down the hall. David Lynch would love the place and I've been amused by it in the past, but doubt I'll stay there again.

However, for being the most expensive cheap hotel I have ever stayed in, it was by far the least admirable. There were hairs in the sheets, rust in the bathtub, no hot water in the shower, BLOOD on the sheets, and the heat did not work (and anyone in chicago during the fall and winter nights can tell you that heat is a bare necessity!). When we asked for new sheets and more towels we were told that the linen closet was locked and that there was no way to get in without the key. In the morning, at about 12:05 pm, \"maintenance\" came pounding on our door demanding to us that we had to leave since checkout time was at 12. When we responded by assuring her we would be out in 5 minutes she yelled back at us, \"NOW!\" On our way out we asked to speak with the manager, and the same lady who claimed to be management told us that the manager was not present at the time.... If you are looking for a cheap hotel or motel in the Chicago area try to stay away from the Abbott Hotel, and if you don't mind staying in a less-than-nice neighborhood be sure to check out the Chicago Lodge on W.

Never in any of my endeavors have I encountered such a despicable place of business. I was in town visiting, things came up, and I needed a place to stay last minute. This hotel was write in the middle of Belmont and only about 90 a night so I thought wow what a deal right? WRONG! I was angered enough that only one of the two heaters in the room worked, the windows did not shut completely, and that the place was just completely run down. If that was not bad enough after I came in for the night I pulled back my bedding to hop into bed to find pubic hairs and a small blood stain. THATS RIGHT PUBIC HAIRS AND A BLOOD STAIN. So what did I do next? I marched down to the front desk where I asked for clean sheets. They informed me that housekeeping was gone for the day and that they just rented their last room so there was nothing that they could do for me. Never in my experience of staying at inexpensive institutions have I seen a hotel/motel. I just sucked it up, and I went back upstairs and brushed the debris out of my bed. After trying to sleep for about an hour I realized that now neither heater in my room worked. At this point i went back down and asked what was wrong with the heat to be greeted with the response: \"There is nothing I can do its broken!\" After all this I just went back up and suffered through the night awaiting my chance to get out of there. At some point I finally fell asleep and was abruptly awakened by a lady slamming on my door and screaming: \"ITS CHECK OUT TIME AND YOUR STILL GET THE HELL OUT\". I packed up as quickly as I could and headed down to the front desk where I demanded to speak to a manager. I was informed that the only time that a manager is present is around 8am in the morning. I am currently attempting to contact the manager in an attempt to receive a refund via the phone number on the one inch square piece of paper i was handed as a business card at the time of my complaints.", "Date": "November 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madrid, Espa\u00c3\u00b1a", "Title": "\u201cWhat a NIGHTMARE--oblivious to the meaning of \"customer service\"\u201d", "Author": "quesuerte", "ReviewID": "UR7543213", "Content": "I just called a few minutes ago to find out the price because I need to make a reservation, and not being from Chicago, clearly the most logical thing to do is call.
