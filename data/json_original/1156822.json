{"Reviews": [{"Content": "I love this hotel! I have stayed at the Hotel4Youth 3 times during the last 5 years. My most recent trip is the one I am reviewing.The hotel is clean, spacious and conveniently located. The reception is permanently manned, and the hotel is secure after-hours by means of an intercom (or key card for guests) to gain entry.The rooms are all very well designed, with a wardrobe for each guest in the room. Despite so many beds being in a room, it is still spacious, with room for a table, stools and room to store luggage. The rooms don't feel small, and are clean, warm and odour-free!Breakfast is served in the dining room, there is a large selection of items to choose from - the only improvement would be to make breakfast open until later!This hotel is excellent value for money, which is one of the reasons I keep coming back!", "Date": "Dec 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR200421702", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "bgoldfish85"}, {"Content": "Like staying in a hotel costing double the price.
