We took transit from the centre of Berlin (TXL bus from the hauptbahnhof to Tegel) and a free shuttle from the airport to the hotel. The hotel is very similar to the Novotel Mitte since it is the same chain. Same, rather small shower/bath combo stall and a room set up for 3 people makes space in the room virtually inexistent. But the rooms were tidy. Very humid inside the building and the room required us to open the window constantly meaning lots of noise from the street and airport where you could see planes moving about out across the fence line. The room was just fine for a one night stay. If you are wanting to explore Berlin's centre which is quite far, I would suggest the shuttle from the airport and then taking the above mentioned TXL bus into town which runs often. 3 English news channels on tv, 2 Internet computers in the lobby. A bar an restaurant downstairs. Guest parking.

However close to the airport, it was quiet, bed and lining good so I had a good sleep. The 2 computers from reception and Internet works so slow, I hated it. If you need to print something you have to send the files on the hotel email address and they print it for you - so zero privacy (not good in a hotel where many guests are business people). If you need the shuttle bus , you have to call to the hotel once you arrived in the airport. I did but the receptionist was not pleased to explain me where do I find the shuttle in the airport. So here the tip- when you arrive, you have to go to the main hall, where you find outside the main bus stations. So follow the sign for BUS in the airport, when you rich the main lobby (at the end of the terminal)go outside, and walk along the bus station where minivans are parked.

They rang the hotel and directed me in the right direction to get the pickup which was just at the door. The driver did not ask for any ID or anything and there are so many people going to the hotel that it was a comfortable shared experience. Transfers are free. LOCATION Hotel location was very close to airport. Main reason for choosing it is airport handiness. I chose this one because it should have been far away enough to get a good nights sleep away from the noise of flying planes. This info i got from other trip advisor reviews. Thank you trip advisor. =) The hotel is so well insulated you wouldn\u00b4t really know you were that close to an airport. So absolutely no worries about noise. There were a few kids playing in hotel at night but that calmed down relatively early. Nothing to do with hotel. CHECK IN Hotel check in staff were extremely efficient and fast. It was a smooth running operation. You just needed to provide credit card as proof of booking. English language of staff was first class. I believe they speak many languages in this hotel. ROOMS: spacious, clean. Sufficient bed linen, lighting, hotel information. TV with free channels and paid. Room service. Mini bar with prices. at mini bar prices to be expected. Hi tech mattress systems and apparently two kids under the age of 16 get to go free. You can even bring pets which is amazing. Wish my wee dog had been there. BATHROOMS: with lots of clean fresh towels. Toilet sealed down with hygiene tapes. Soap, shampoo and body lotion of great quality. Power shower with lots of hot water and bath. Not a giant bath but one if you choose you prefer to relax and unwind from your travels. RESTAURANT: had vegetarian options. plenty of variety. nice wines and of course plenty of german beers to get your travel tastes and experiences going. COMPUTERS: down stairs in lobby with free internet and printing facilities. Wifi in rooms at cost. GYM: apparently they have a gym now. but as a runner they have a wooded park around the hotel which you can walk or run in. They have an out door swimming pool which isn\u00b4t heated.

I guess this means that this hotel will loose a big chunk of their customer base and maybe shut down to. So if you need an airport hotel in the near of Tegel Airport in the next half year read on: Location: This seems to be the most centrally located hotel to Tegel airport, which made it my first choice for my overnight stay. The hotel is located about 1 kilometre away from the terminal by foot/car, so if you plan to walk from either the terminal to the hotel or vice versa, or even from the bus stop Luftfracht (like me), keep in mind that it is not a short way, especially not with heavy luggage or before/after dawn in the dark. The hotel is not only a bit out of the way, but also not to easy to find, when you do not know the way and its dark. Luckily the hotel offers a shuttle service from 5 am in the morning, which is operated in a first come, first served way. So come a bit earlier, as you might have to queue for your place in the shuttle bus in the morning. No reservation for a dedicated time is possible, the shuttle just runs between airport and hotel. Hotel: The hotel seems to be build in the 70ties or 80ties and still retained a bit of the \"charme\" from these years in some parts of the building. My room occured to have been renovated, but this might be some years ago. The hotel was probably a Novotel before, as some items still had the logo of Novotel on it. The hotel has a big lobby, a restaurant (didn't test), two computers in the lobby (handy for online check-in for smartphone ignorants as me) and two elevators. Free parking is also provided, as i have noticed. Rooms: The rooms appeared to be renovated and had typical Mercure look with a large double bed, with a slightly soft mattress, a sofa-chair for relaxing, a desk, a minibar and a really old-school tv. Though it was renovated, you can see that the room isn't the newest one anyone(especially some walls need a face lift). The bath is clean, but doesn't really have the newest deccor anymore. Worse was, that when i entered the room i had fouly smell in my nose, which was easily trackable to come from the bathroom. This smell never stopped in the bathroom. The room was airconditioned and very well noise isolated, which comes in handy, as you might hear the airplanes landing and departing otherwise. Didn't hear any noise from the planes at all. There a few negatives i must point out about the room, apart from the smell in the bathroom: The pillows on the bed were very small, which makes sleep not to comfortable for me. The room didn't have a shower, but a bathtub with a semi-showering place integrated in the bathtube. You may like that or not. The TV is old and small. The remote of my TV was also not working, probably because the batteries were low. Nobody seems to check on this. The hotel was offering a bottle of water for drinking, for the striking price of only 4,10. We are talking about water here, something you get in other hotels for free. The minibar was also locked with a seal, so that you could not look inside without open the seal. There is nothing better than a hotel, that doesn't trust its guest. Last, but not least, the rooms occured clean to me. No complaints. Breakfast: Costs extra, so i didn't try. Staff: The staff made a mixed impression on me. Though being overall nice, they are a bit to lax, not to professional. First they didn't find my reservation, because their own booking systems mixed something up and then they failed to inform me about the possibility of the airport transfer and also about a wake up call. I had to ask for this myself. When asking about the airporttransfer, the receptionist also made a bit of an annoyed look, as if he is tired of telling everybody to come 15 minutes early, before they want to go. Well, as i said, there were overall nice, but not as professional as in other hotels. Overall a very solid hotel, nothing fancy, everything a bit older, but reliable. I wouldn't want to stay here for longer, but for one night it is really okay, especially if you really need a hotel near the airport.", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prague, Czech Republic", "Title": "\u201cNice airport hotel - free shuttle to the airport\u201d", "Author": "alespesl", "ReviewID": "UR120522712", "Content": "Me and my friend have stayed in this hotel 1 night.

Also including: Wi-Fi, late checkout and double A|Club points.\" When I arrived at the hotel, I expected to get a WiFi voucher at no extra cost, but they said I have to pay for it. I told them, I booked including wifi , cited the booking and they still said no. I would only get a 5 Euro rebate with this rate and only if I purchased the full day pass, no rebate on the smaller vouchers. \"Including WiFi\" here supposedly only means, that the room has Wifi. For me, that's a very debateable interpretation of what they wrote. I really hate it, when the deliberately try to rip you off and that's how I interpret it. What I did get, was the bathrobe and the water. The coffee/tea maker in the room, I also paid extra for, was broke. It countinuously tried to heat up and then stopped after a few seconds. Since my flight was in the early morning, I don't know about the newspaper and I don't use AClub. What was great though, was the excellent airport shuttle service and the room was ok, too. Pro: - Close to the airport (four minute shuttle ride), ideal for early flights - very good and free on demand shuttle.

This made for a no-stress departure the next morning, and saved money besides. It has a tiny pool and workout room, and only one English tv station, but that wasn't the point ... We slept well and were able to wake up and be at the airport gate 45 minutes later! By the way the hotel restaurant is expensive (of course) but there are plenty of breakfast options at the airport - Tegel is a snap to negotiate.", "Date": "May 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arlington, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cServes Its Purpose As Airport Hotel-Not Much More\u201d", "Author": "PlateMan", "ReviewID": "UR25934205", "Content": "Pretty average airport hotel.

The Mercure was clearly our only choice. They never told us how to avail ourselves of their free shuttle from Tegel but serendipitously we figured it out. For those who would be better prepared in knowing: go to the Information Desk and they will phone the shuttle. With that it took about 15 minutes for the shuttle to arrive, by which time we were solidly frozen. Our arrival at the hotel was a bit confused.....them, not us. We got a key to room 214 and it didn't work. Both of us, exhausted air warriors, struggled with the key and just as we were about to return to reception, the door did open, albeit from the INSIDE. The woman sleeping there obviously wasn't very safety conscious but that's another story. Eventually we did get a room of our own. It was compact and clean with a shower that required a phone call to learn how to operate and was located in a bathtub that a gymnast might find easy to enter but we did not! We had ordered a wakeup call both from the reception and from the easily operated alarm on the inroom phone. One of them did work.....and that was the one we set in the room. We still await the reception's wakeup call. Similarly with a cab (the shuttle doesn't start until 5 a.m. which was too late for us). The promised cab was never ordered. When we got downstairs they were completely clueless to our cab reservation of the night before. They hastened to call a cab with no apology in sight and we did get to our flight on time. What is striking about all of this is that this is a hotel that one would only stay in for transit so it should be a finely honed operation when it comes to wakeup calls and taxis. We were quite surprised at their inefficiency.

Stayed for a few nights (3 I think). As soon as I arrived at Tegel from Zurich on Air Berlin, I went to the Information desk to ask how to get to the hotel. Apparently, I had to go to the next building (terminal) for the pick-up bus to Mercure. After 4 minutes walk, I got to the other terminal, and went to the information desk and the lady said she would call the hotel for pick-up and I was asked to wait outside the terminal (10 seconds walk). The mini van arrived and the journey to the hotel took about 6 minutes. The hotel is quite nice, you will see a lot of big trees outside and you can go for a walk. The lobby is fairly big and there are two computers offering free internet. The check-in was quick. There's a restaurant and a sitting area (lounge) and there's a swimming pool outside where you can also sit/have a drink. My room was clean with a small bathroom. It's a copy of Novotel Zurich (if you have stayed at Novotel Zurich then, you can imagine this Mercure room that I got). Nice comfortable bed, clean linen etc. with shower gel/shampoo/soap in the bathroom. I don't remember making my own coffee there so I don't think there was tea/coffee making facilities in the room. TV channels were OK, mostly in German language. I went for a walk during my stay to the airport (20 minutes walk) since that is the only place of civilisation whereby you can get newspapers and food if you don't want to eat in the hotel. There is a petrol station on the way to the airport with a shop called Bistro. I was delighted thinking of the hot foods/pastries that I was going to buy at Bistro, but when I went inside the only hot thing they sell is coffee! You can buy chocolate and junk food here though. On my first day out in Berlin, I took the free mini van service from the hotel (you have to request for this, say 10 mins before you need it) to Tegel and caught a bus into Berlin. I took X9 bus and paid 2.10 Euro for a single journey, per person. The journey by bus to Berlin (Zoo Garden) took about 25 minutes.

I was a bit apprehensive about staying so far from Berlin's centre initially. I had booked last minute and my travel agent hadn't been able to find anything else. So I took this booking and gave it a chance. To get into Berlin, you hop on the free shuttle to Tegel airport. Then you grab an X97 (Can't remember the exact number, be sure to check before you go) bus and it can drop you at a number of main stops including the Hauptbahnhof and Unter Den Linden. The room was aesthetically pleasing and very very quiet. Room service was yum, the TV was a bit tricky to work, too many steps to get to free-to-air tv I thought. Bathroom was gorgeous, lots of room and the shower worked, though it was slow to drain sometimes. The breakfast served in the restaurant was amazing. 2 types of scrambled eggs and anything your heart desired. I was a bit disappointed at how crowded it was on New Years Eve morning, there was barely any food, drinks and plates around and the kitchen seemed a little slow to replenish supplies. Surely knowing how many guests they were going to have they could've staffed the restaurant a little better? The 24-hr reception staff were very helpful, friendly and spoke good english. Near the toilets in the lobby there is a rack containing touristy cards for all the major Barlin attractions, I found these helpful. Internet access was my only problem. The hotel offers access via a third party terminal but this was extremely expensive. The airport has little stands but I couldn't access my webmail via these. I think if I had've had a laptop with me I might've been able to connect from my room free but I didn't so I'll never know! If you need postal services, front desk can offer limited service. Your next best bet is to take the shuttle bus to the airport, there is a post office there where you can send parcels, anything other than plain letters and postcards. The lady that helped me didn't speak english so knowing a bit of german might help you there. There is also a small supermarket type store that sells foody bits at the airport. This is handy if you don't want to pay out for room service, but just want some fruit and drinks etc. One big warning though - there are 2 Mercure hotels at Tegel airport, make sure you arrive at the right one. It is a 10 minute cab ride if you go to the wrong one. Overall, a great stay and if I knew someone who had to hang out near the airport for a night or 2, i'd recommend it to them.

I was greeted by a shocked \"Hallo\" from some poor German woman who was already in that room. They gave me a room with someone else already in it. I must have scared the daylights out of that poor woman. So I walked back down to the check in desk and told them what had happened. The clerk then gave me another key card to another room. While I was there, one of the guests called to report an intruder (me, I'm guessing). From overhearing some of that conversation in my very broken German, I think a weak apology was given, and that was it. After I got to my new room (very carefully opening the door this time), I finally got some peace and quiet. The bathroom was fine and functioned well, but the bed was not very comfortable and I did not get much sleep. My biggest complaint is that I don't think the woman I walked in on due to the incompetence of the hotel staff was compensated in any way. Upon coming back to Berlin I stayed at the Hilton instead.
