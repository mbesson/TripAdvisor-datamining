I stayed 2 nights at this hotel, first night on the second floor (#209) was clean and nice but had problem with the curtain - fell off . They moved me to another room #210, the room is also clean, but the bathroom need some improvement, also it is time for them to get new bed sheet and pillow covers they look old and worn. Each room has AC, small fridge, telephone, hair dryer and a nice LCD TV (cable). No FREE internet! you must pay for the wireless connection and the fee is expensiveThe food  drinks at the hotel (Hot Mango restaurant) was OK - I rather eat somewhere else. They are expensive. (service charge/tips automatically added to your bill).

However the experience was not as I expected....The overall design of the hotel is very unique and the service is satisfactory, sadly the room was not up to par. I face many problems during my stay. 1) The toilet is poorly maintained, we faced difficulty with the flushing system and requested for a change of room, however the reception informed us that all rooms were occupied. And during the second night we were awoken by the extremely unpleasant smell of sewage due to a clog!!! The smell is intolerably and we had to open the main door to clear the air. 2) We had trouble locking the room door and we had to ask for help twice. 3) We requested for a change of the electric kettle several times as it was quite filthy and the heated water came out milky. 4) Our room was not re-made during the second day, so the bed was un-made, the towels were not changed, etcUltimately, it was not a good stay and it seems this hotel is desperately in need of proper maintainance.", "Date": "Jun 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR259253908", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "celebskin"}, {"Content": "Wonderful Stay at Courtyard Hotel        Staff at Courtyard Hotel", "Date": "May 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR535425465", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Bambi_Boulangerie"}, {"Content": "The lovely Courtyard We stayed at the Courtyard Hotel at the beginning of Feb 2008. We love that it is a small boutique hotel with none of the big hotel trappings. The staff were generous and friendly and helped with whatever questions we had. The restaurant food was spectacular - very yummy and we chose to eat there 3 nights out of 5. If you are after bar action or a busy hotel with lots of guests it probably isnt the place for you. We liked that it was quiet and small and didnt have the Aussie yobbo's that come with so many hotels in Bali. The hotel is small, very clean  reserved and in a great spot close to Seminyak for eating and shopping. My husband and I return to the Courtyard in June for another week.

I go to Bali at least 3 times a year - mostly alone and during non-peak periods to get away from the busy city life and just chill. I generally try to find different places to stay in as Bali is so beautiful that it's nice to try new places and meet new people.The Courtyard was recommended by friends who stayed there in 2006 and said for a single traveller, it was perfect in terms of location etc.The first impression I got of it was that it looked very much like a small apartment concept with all the rooms overlooking the central courtyard which contained the pool. The room was clean and hospitable and the staff were very welcoming and friendly.A 7-min walk to the beach - I'm not kidding - you just have to get detailed instructions from the front desk as it is a little confusing to find the path to the beach but once you have, it's really easy. Every morning, I'd find my way to the beach for an hour's walk and reflection and come back to a great breakfast which came with the room rate.The central pool made a great place to meet the other hotel guests. Met a great Canadian couple there as well as an interesting Spanish family.While I do make it a point to try different places each time I go to Bali, I definitely won't mind staying at the Courtyard again!Value for money - great staff - hotel restaurant is wonderful  location is close to main Legian for shopping and massages at Jari Menari!!", "Date": "Feb 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR385987531", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "MHMoo"}, {"Content": "A quiet little gem We have just returned from 17 nights in Bali with the last 6 of those at the Courtyard Hotel and Apartments. We stayed in a one bedroom apartment which was wonderful to have that extra room at the end of the holiday.The staff were efficient, friendly and were very quick and thorough with cleaning the room. Breakfast was included and consisted of a continental breakfast with a few choices. You could also have a cooked breakfast if you wanted. Again the meal would be placed on the table very quickly and efficiently.The most impressive thing about the hotel was the quietness and this I am sure is because it is such a small hotel. It appeared not to be full every night but even so we never heard any other guests and certainly no noise from busy Rum Jungle Road. The pool was only a few steps from our door and we mostly had it to ourselves the whole time we were there. Overall we would return. It is close to some good restaurants and plenty of shopping close by.", "Date": "Feb 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR981823351", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "ljsroslyn"}, {"Content": "Loved everything about it!       fantastic place!", "Date": "Aug 23, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR602916986", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Kannchi"}, {"Content": "Courtyard Hotel superb!! We have just spent 4 nights at the Courtyard Hotel and apartments in Legian Bali. We chose this hotel after looking at previous reviews on Trip Advisor. The previous reviews were not wrong!! This hotel deserves praise. We decided to splash out and stay in a two bedroom apartment as we were travelling as a couple with our 17 year old son. When we walked into the boutique hotel complex we were wowwed and then when we entered the apartment we were wowed even more. We stayed in # 105 on the ground floor with a small grassy area outside. The apartment had been decorated tastefully and was immaculately clean. ( We were shown other apartments but felt this particular one was the pick of the bunch). The hotel rooms looked simple but inviting also. The complex itself has been maintained extremely well and the staff who carry out these duties are a bunch of very friendly people. The restaurant at Courtyard Hotel ( Hot Mango) served delicious meals and snacks at what seemed reasonable prices. The creme brulee was the best I have tasted. The waiting staff were also exceptionally friendly and personable. Although we preferred teh Seminyak end of Bali for eating and shopping, the Courtyard Hotel had some interesting shops surrounding it. We met Mark the kiwi owner of the complex who was also friendly and welcoming. As we looked at other hotels in the area with declining number sof guests staying we feel Courtyard is doing something right looking at the number of guests they had in residence. We certainly will return to this very pleasant hotel.", "Date": "Jul 25, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR211644207", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "bachk"}, {"Content": "Perfect hotel, wonderful staff               More photos", "Date": "May 22, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR518244808", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "2 week Wedding holiday @ Courtyard Hotel        The boys taking over the pool", "Date": "Mar 30, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR950471337", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "botaylor"}, {"Content": "\u9287\u5c42\u4efa\u9288\u5a43\u68be\u9287\ue0a0\u4e9c\u9287\u52e9\u4ef9\u9287\u6b0d\u501b   showReview(19541847, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR936182164", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "\u9287\u5098\u5013\u9288?> \u9287\u5098\u5013\u9288?</a> </div>"}, {"Content": "\u9288\u70bd\u5157\u9289\u581b\u5130\u9289\u7b3a\u5114\u9289\u6d96\u5110\u9289?#x201d;   showReview(19166459, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 16, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR225903711", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608487-d584554-r22293039-Courtyard_Hotel_Apartments-Legian_Bali.html", "HotelID": "584554", "Price": "$125"}}
