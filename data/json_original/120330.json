The staff here is extremely friendly and very helpful and seem to go out of their way to please. The only major complaint that I have is that the food at Whitney's, their restaurant, is barely passable. I had many buffet breakfasts there, and although the fruit is great, everything else was not worth eating. The bacon and sausages were barely warm, the pancakes, waffles were dry and the eggs just ok. I made the mistake of going there for dinner. While waiting 40 minutes for my meal, I had the pleasure of enjoying toast in the place of dinner rolls for bread. Toast. The meal was fine, though the pork chop I had was slightly overcooked and dry, but still tasted ok, though nothing special. For the price I paid, it should have been a lot better. I can't comment on the other facilities because I didn't have time to use them, nor can I comment on the location since I didn't have much time to wander around.

The fan from the heater/air conditioner was very very loud. It wasn't broken, just loud. We turned it off at night so we could sleep. The 2nd complaint was something we had not run into for a long time at all of the Marriotts we've stayed at. The right side of the dresser contained a small fridge. It was loaded with stuff, sodas, candy, etc., that you would be charged for if you moved it. So if you wanted to buy some food/drink and store it, there was very little room. The final complaint was one that drives me crazy. The $5 bottle of water on the dresser that you could buy. There were also 2 wine glasses and a bottle of wine. We thought, hey, nice. Not so fast, the note on the bottle said that it cost $16. I really don't like hotels trying to sell me food and drink while I'm in my room. The valet parking does cost $17/day.

That to me showed embracing warmth and openness because not only did we meet many people of differing nationalities, but felt at home. The shuttle service was great.

When the bed arrived it was of a single size even though we had been assured it was a double size and would fit two.

Getting to South Beach on Metrorail you go to Government Centre, then take the frequent S bus to South Beach. It did seem only just safe on a Sunday morning - so I would think of taking a taxi on an evening, if by yourself or if any doubts. From MIA Airport, the price is about $40 including tip for a taxi. I stayed here with business & I was told by locals that everywhere is reasonably safe within 20 minutes around. The closest-by area to avoid seemed to be Grand Avenue in Coconut Grove.

We were part of a wedding party of over 40 out-of-town guests and the bride & groom had chosen this hotel due to proximity of the wedding.

I had booked the rooms 2 months in advance and the hotel knew about this wedding at least 8 months in advance. Furthermore, I had called 24 hours before to check on the rooms and request early check-in due to the hectic wedding rehearsal schedule that day. The excuse given for the late check-in was that we wanted our rooms on the same floor. I think that is was poor planning and prioritizing on their part. To add insult to injury, one of my family members was charged $250 for smoking in their. room. We were not told about this fee when I called to make reservations and requested smoking rooms; when we checked in; not posted on their website. However, there are tiny cards with fine print in the rooms to let you know! Ironically, two other members of our party smoked in their rooms and they were not charged the fee. So...smokers beware of the Marriott chain in Florida! By the way, I did look up the Florida Non-smooking Law and the penalty is $100. I guess Marriott needs the extra revenue to \"recover\" the room.
