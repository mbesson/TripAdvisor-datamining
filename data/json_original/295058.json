We traveled with a group of friends and were aware that the location is a little off, but still, we were a bit surprised. The taxi we took upon arrival had a hard time finding the hotel, even though getting advise from the hotel staff by phone. The area where the hotel is situated is clearly a recidential area. If your ok with the location being a little off, you can consider to stay here if you get a good deal as we did, otherwise - forget it. The rooms were quite spacious, but really in need of renovation. The room was a bit funky with it\u00c2\u00b4s carpetting that really had soaked in all the cigarrette smoke. The hotel was undergoing renovation, so maybe they are doing something about this. If you have trouble sleeping you may want to be aware of the fact that the hotel is right next to the train track. The sound of the train woke me up a few times. Our friends, who stayed on the other side of the corridor said they did not even hear the train pass . I\u00c2\u00b4d recommend a room that is not next to the track - or getting really hammered on cheap Turkish wines :) The breakfast was very good. I also thought the pool area at the rooftop was excellent for sunbathing, relaxing and swimming. Actually, one of my Istanbul moments was experienced at the rooftop, lying in a sun lounger, reading a Mehmet Murat Summers book in the warm sun, drinking chai and listening to the prayer calls blastered from nearby mosques while gazing at the beautiful view of Istanbuls Asia side. The staff was friendly, but could have been more proactive. I practically had to walk into the kitchen to get that cup of chai poolside :) I\u00c2\u00b4ll wrap up by saying that if you are seriosly ok with the off location and get a brilliant deal, it would be ok to go here - Let\u00c2\u00b4s just hope the rooms have been renovated.", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cNot a four star but comfortable enough\u201d", "Author": "UKpolobear", "ReviewID": "UR119890527", "Content": "Really not a four star hotel. However, it has a fantastic roof terrace with a great pool. The breakfast was fantastic and the staff really helpful and friendly. The rooms are large and bright. Our original room was right next to the railway line and they changed us without a problem. We also arrived very early in the morning and were given a room straight away and invited to breakfast at no extra charge. Location is not great. Struggled to find it. I booked into the hotel for the free shuttle to Sabiha Gokcen but it did not exist. Be aware a taxi would cost EUR45. However, the bus stop is a 3 minute walk away. Catch the E9 (every hour at aprox twenty past the hour) to Sabiha Gokcen. Took 20 minutes and cost TL3.5.

Upon arrival we were met with the most rude staff who were very reluctant to show us to our room until we had paid for it in advance. We paid the \u00c2\u00a3180 for the room which was the daily rate and were escorted to our room by the most ignorant concierge. We were horrified when we saw the room, holes in the wall, holes in the flooring and beds which looked like they would collapse. A z bed had been placed in there for my 9 year old but no bedding was placed on it? The bathroom was disgusting, the shower did not work and the toilet had been fixed to the wall about 1 foot higher than it should have been. It was the most ridiculous thing we had ever seen. This hotel is positioned directly to a railway track and every 15 minutes a high speed train passes through and makes the room shake. We complained to the reception and they were very rude and refused to move us. We cheked out the following morning and would never ever return. This hotel is by far the most disgusting place i have ever had the misfortune to stay in. I cannot believe that they are able to call themselves a high class hotel and have the cheek to charge the prices they do. The worst Hotel in Istanbul by far, do not stay here.", "Date": "June 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "The Hague, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cmost noisy hotel ever\u201d", "Author": "MenN2010", "ReviewID": "UR107335455", "Content": "Hotel rooms with walls of cardboard, we could hear the neighbors speak. Some nights we got out of sleap from late in the night till early in the morning to enjoy the sexual escapades of the neighbors above. Not really logical, because the beds were really bad. Every morning we woke upwith back pain. The mentioned noise from the trains gets used to a certain point and stops between 23:00 and 06:00 am. The hotel is more oriented to groups, so loud music in bar and restaurant, and nightly meetings in corridors and rooms. As icing on the cake there is in the corridors and in the public areas continuously played music. This music you can hear in your hotel room when the door is closed. If this is not a problem you are staying in a hotel with a beautiful patio and pool thanks to a magnificent sea view, excellent shuttel to go into town, train station around the corner and across the raod near the water with a direct connection to the airport.
