I should initially point out that we got a deal whereby we stayed here for half price, so our expectations weren't too high to only be paying around \u20ac35 per night. However, when we got to our room, we did find it to be noticeably small and simple, though the bathroom was very smart, with good water pressure. The air con wasn't great, just as we had experienced at another Mercure in Cologne only days earlier. I was very surprised not to have a minibar in the room, and this appears to be the case throughout this hotel. However, the hotel is in a good location. We had so much luggage yet walked to and from the Hautbahnof which is about 20 minutes walk from the hotel. Many of Berlin's best attractions are also within walking distance, such as museum island (about 30-40mins) and the Reichstag (40mins). The hotel is additionally right next to a metro station which will take you to these places in minutes. There is also a wonderful Italian restaurant (about 10 minutes walk) called Roma nearby, where we both enjoyed one of the best pizzas we've ever consumed and beautiful house wine (1 litre) for \u20ac30 all in, so certainly a place to check out if you're in need of a cheap, but very apatezing (and romantic) meal. Pros Good location, 30 min walk from Museum Island, 2 min walk from nearby Metro station For near-central Berlin, it's good value. Good bathroom with good water pressure Cons No minibar/fridge The \u20ac9 (for 24h) in-room internet access isn't Wi-Fi but hard wired, and the cable is only 1.5 metres, so no chance of staying in bed when online.

They said they would send me there in a cab and I could have a complimentary drink in the bar when I got there by way of compensation. Uh, no. Worse still they couldn't given me a cab back to the station the following day. Seeing as I had pre-paid and the hotel admitted they were aware I was arriving late this was shocking and I told them they would have to find me another hotel nearer to the station.

I had to kick up a huge fuss, which I'm not prone to doing, to get them to even try and rectify the situation. Their main response to anything was to say it wasn't their fault! Eventually they booked me into the Jolly Hotel Vivaldi (which was jolly nice), which took all of two seconds and they could have just done in the first place. Then they took half an hour to get me a cab. I finally got to check in to the Vivaldi at 11pm.

Very easy to get to from Schonefeld; regional train to Friedrichstrasse then 2 stops on the U6 in the direction of Alt-Tegel to Zinnowitzer Strasse. Hotel is less than 1 minute walk from the station. Good local area with excellent transport links and a late bus that stops right outside every 30 mins during the night. Brilliant if you're out in the City til the early hours which we always are (no art galleries and museums for us I'm afraid!!) Lots of bars and restaurants 1 stop away in the Oranienburger Strasse and Tor areas. However, you need to explore Berlin (Hackescher Markt, Kreuzberg and Mitte in particular), we only had the odd drink in the areas close to the hotel for convenience. Immaculately clean, professional and modern looking hotel. Not particularly inspiring from the outside but this is a well-appointed member of the Accor brand. Good points: Great bathroom and brilliant walk-in power-shower, spot lighting, comfortable bed and superbly friendly and helpful staff. Minus points: no safe, no tea/coffee, small room also our double room was two singles pushed together. We would not stay at this hotel again as we always stay somewhere different in our twice yearly visits to the city. However, this hotel cannot be faulted in any way and it comes fully recommended without hesitation. Behind the Accor Suitehotel Potsdamer Platz this is the best place we have stayed at in Berlin.", "Date": "April 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cgreat value - in der mitte\u201d", "Author": "lazysusan", "ReviewID": "UR4128694", "Content": "just returned from a two night stay at the mercure - a very unpromising facade, but don't let that put you off!

We travel a lot, and in my opinion the deal was excellent: 59 euros per night (the breakfast would have been available for 13 euros per person). The hotel is conveniently located next to Zinnerwitzer subway station, and you can easily travel from Tegel airport by using public transportation. Our room was smallish and simply decorated, and very clean. The only thing we missed was a minibar (in other words: a fridge to keep water bottles cold), but for this rate it is fully understandable that there is not one. I was very glad that the hairdryer in the room was powerful enough, unfortunately many hotels have these wall-mounted \"jokes\" and it takes ages to dry thick long hair with those. There are 2 supermarkets, Subway sandwich shop and Balzaco coffee shop around the corner. I would also like to recommend SpeiseKombinat - the restaurant located at Chaussee Strasse (again, around the corner). Delicious, affordably priced eastern-mediterranean food - if weather allows, enjoy your meal at their patio. We also visited \"Hafenbar\" near the hotel. If you are in your early twenties, german speaker plus love 70's hits - this disco is for you.

Rooms were nicely furnished, very modern and light, however room is a little small- but if you are a tourist it's ideal. Only a shower in the bathroom, so if you like a soak in the bath after a lot of walking then this is probably not for you! Safe deposit boxes are available from the main reception, so don't panic like I did thinking their is nowhere to leave your money! Their is a deposit to pay which is refunded when you check out. Staff were very polite and helpful, they spoke much better English than I spoke German and had a lot of helpful information to supply me with. Close to Oranienburger Strasse, with numerous places to eat, and from their most attractions are within walking distance. Berlin is accesible by foot, however the U and S Bahns will probably be used, so being close to a station is helpful. Only takes a matter of minutes to travel between stations - be careful though, on weekends the U Bahn does not run as frequently!", "Date": "May 4, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hartford, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cGreat value and location in East Berlin\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2967191", "Content": "I've stayed at this hotel twice - once right after it opened in December 2002 and then in August, 2003, when it was still a Dorint. The staff was friendly and helpful. The clientele is mostly European with few Americans - so few, in fact, that the bartender remembered me on my second visit! Rooms are compact, but well designed. Location is terrific - convenient to bus, tram and U-Bahn. Buffet breakfast (included) was plentiful and good. On my second trip, I had a package which included two dinners, not nearly as good as the breakfasts. The menu is unaccountably Italian, which seemed to stretch the skills of the German chef. But since the meals were esstentially free and they served late, I didn't much care. I prefer staying in the East, where most of the hotels are new and expensive, so I consider this a great find and would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "December 31, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Mercure Hotel Berlin City", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d260365-Reviews-Mercure_Hotel_Berlin_City-Berlin.html", "Price": "$77 - $185*", "Address": "<div class=\"amenFloat\">", "HotelID": "260365", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/e9/af/1a/hotelbar.jpg"}}
