We found the rooms clean and comfortable. However, we would not recommend staying here for leisure or sightseeing purposes. If your a tourist try to find a backpackers or hostel as the Ibis is an unsatisfactory solution. It is a considerable walk (especially with luggage and in the heat) to and from Ibis to the train station. There are a few bakeries along the way for a quick breakfast - however no where to eat dinner. It is then a 20minute train ride (tickets cost about 3.00 euro return per person) to Catalyuna station (the centre of Barcelona.) At night (for two young female travellers) we found the walk uncomfortable and we did not feel very safe. With squatters, people drinking on the streets and occasional prostitutes we opted to go back to Ibis before it got dark. This limited our time as tourists in Barcelona. The staff were friendly and spoke some English however were not able to help at all regarding tourist sites, using the public transport etc. The man at reception didn't know who Gaudi was and could not assist in finding the buildings. Very disappointing. All in all, pay the extra and stay somewhere else in town.

This is your typical IBIS and you can be normally be sure of what you're going to get in advance with an IBIS. I had a good check-in and wifi was 5 euros for 24 hours.

The property is \"shoe horned\" into a very small plot of land, with a minimal number of parking spots surrounded by an 18 ft wire fence with a locked gate allowing for car access.

One can take the taxi from the airport. It takes about 20 minutes. The nearest local train station is about 900 metres away from where one can take the train to Cornella station. From Cornella, Metro is available to connect to all parts of Barcelona. It is better to know the train time tables to Cornella. The train is normally there every half hour if you miss one then you are stuck for nearly an hour, The air conditioning was not functioning and since we were on a higher floor we couldnot open the window fully and it was quite warm in May. The hotel is next to a motorway so there was a lot of noise. The hotel was otherwise good. Breakfast was nice. For Dinner, we normally ate at Barcelona, however there are a few restaurants around.

However the reception staff were freindly and helpfull giving us a map to the train station(10 minute walk)and a map of Barcelona and other info. AREA Molins de Rei is a mix of comercial and apartment blocks.We arrived around 11pm and took a short walk to find somewhere to eat,there is a chinese restaraunt up the road and the food was not good,the area near the hotel looks bleak at night and not much better during the day,however there are more shops and restaraunts towards the train station. BARCELONA The train from Molins costs 2.80 euros return(25 minutes)and the last train from barcelona is 2355 from sants station. Atractions are expensive(at least 10 euros) Parc Guell and Mont Tibidabo are worth a visit,as is the short train journey to Montserrat and Sitges which has a great beach. Recomended restaraunt is EGIPTE(Las Ramblas 79) Barcelona is very laid back city and a bit ecentric,look out for the guy who walks around the habour area stark naked!! Beware of pick pockets,i had a rucksack on my back and i was waiting at traffic lights,i felt a tug on one of the zips,i turned around quickly and a women had her hand in mid air near my rucksack and quikly pulled her hand back.You will notice that alot of people carry front facing rucksacks.You also dont want to walk along the side streets off Las Ramblas at night,very dodgy looking people lurking along these streets!!! The ibis is not a bad hotel as a base to explore Barcelona,however be aware when booking direct with the Ibis website as my partner booked some months in advance and when we got to the hotel we found out the transaction had not gone through and she had to pay for the room that night.Reception said that they dont take payment untill you arrive,however my partner said there was a pay now option on the website??", "Date": "September 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "ireland", "Title": "\u201cbad service\u201d", "Author": "youngcoupleIreland", "ReviewID": "UR7714731", "Content": "my boyfriend and i have just returned from this hotel we went to barcelona for a relaxing break.
