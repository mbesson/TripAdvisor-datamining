The location suited us - we are good walkers and walked to the Eiffel Tower, yet returning late at night we were pleased it was close to several Metro stations. The breakfast although expensive offered more choice than others I have experienced in France. The bed in the Executive room ( if they have special deals or a more spacious room is required - this is the best) was exceptionally comfortable. I agree with the reviewer that no plug in the washbasin is not good. I would suggest that light sleepers take earplugs because although this is in a very quiet area the poor soundproofing on the windows mean that the loud buzzing of motorbikes can clearly be heard. In general the staff were very friendly and helpful and put our suitcase in a locked, secure room on the day we vacated the hotel so we could pick it up later. A useful tip is if you have already purchased your Metro tickets walk down Rue Brunel and take the unmarked steps down underground in the small green area in the centre of Bd Pereire - this takes you to the RER station where you can continue underground to the Metro (good in bad weather).", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida, United States", "Title": "\u201cFirst time in Paris...\u201d", "Author": "Dagmar R", "ReviewID": "UR122517896", "Content": "Last week, my husband and I went to Paris for the first time to celebrate New Year's.

It's a beautiful \"boutique hotel\". The room was very comfortable and a good size for me and my husband. The location of this hotel couldn't be better...it's a few minutes away (walking distance) from the Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysees. The guys at the concierge/front desk are great! They all are very nice, speak English and helped us with everything we needed.

The bathrooms are a little small, but manageable, the bed was comfortable and the staff were great. Staff lent us a converter for our camera charger when we forgot it in Belgium, and at no cost! Really quite a charming place and very well kept. Nice and quiet. There's a small flatscreen in the room, closet and desk. Everything has been recently renovated, so it looks good inside the rooms as well as the hotel itself. There are places to eat just around the corner, a grocery store about a 5 minute walk away, and a metro station even closer. Arc de Triomphe is only about a 10 minute walk, and really, you can walk everywhere you want (almost) from here. We hit almost every major stop in Paris and we did it on foot. this place being where it was made everything perfect - you could be in the centre of everything in 5-10 minutes, but you were also out of the way enough that it was peacefully quiet when you wanted it to be. Make sure you try the sandwiches and baguettes from the bakery where the small traffic circle is. we often got bread from there and groceries from down the street and just ate in the hotel room, which they did not have an issue with. I would definitely suggest this place, as I would stay here again myself. My only tip: If you are larger than 6 feet and around 190 lbs, you might find great issue with the bathroom space if you're in a room like we were. Everything was manageable, but people bigger than I am might find it uncomfortable maneuvering in the shower or getting around the toilet.", "Date": "November 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Klaipeda, Lithuania", "Title": "\u201cGood location, nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "pajuriomergaite", "ReviewID": "UR118058569", "Content": "Loved the hotel for it's location: 5 min walk from porte maillot and 10 to arc de triumphe!

Check-in and Check-out were very easy without unpleasant surprisings. The room was very nice and looked somehow French. My colleagues were in other hotels in the surrounding and compared to the others it was the most individual and beautiful one. Now the Wireless Lan worked very well on the ground floor (what is a minus at the same time). Now the restrictions: The bathroom is very small. But maybe other rooms have bigger ones. On the other hand it was quite new and always clean. While it was very hot outside during my stay, the room was as well. It was not so easy to find sleep: whith an open window, one could hear all the noise from the street, what seemingly occurs during hot summer nights. My earplugs worked here very well. A minibar would have been great. To conclude: A nice hotel.

Hotel: Most of the hotels in Paris, like this one, are located in XIX century buildings, so rooms are small, and sometimes elevators very tiny.
