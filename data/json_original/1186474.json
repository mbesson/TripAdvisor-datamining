He fixed it and when you came down to use it - it didn't work again.\" \"I'm sorry it is not my fault.

Ivbergs will expect upfront payment before you step into your room and will not help you beyond this point.

We went to one which was enough for us. The breakfast was excellent with a varity of breads, scrambled eggs, bacon or sausage, a selection of cold meats, toast, cerials and tea and coffee. Near the hotel is a number of supermarkets for cheap wine and imbiss stands which serve great food. The wife loved the cakes which were out of this world. Adilinos italian restuarant is great aswell. The location of the hotel enables you to eat alot cheaper than in the city centre where a beer was on average 3.50 euros for a small beer. I recommend the imbiss stands for cheap food and a nice berliner beer. I have nothing but praise for the hotel, location, people and the city it self.

Although the hotel is uninspiring from the outside, don\u2019t let that put you off. Once inside, the hotel is clean, bright, modern and looks and feels very new. The staff we encountered were unobtrusive, but polite and helpful when approached, with a good grasp of English (far better than our German!) Our room, on the 2nd floor, was to the rear of the building, overlooking the car park. As with any hotel, the rooms at the front may well suffer from traffic noise \u2013 we can\u2019t confirm either way, although the traffic past the hotel didn\u2019t strike us as being too busy at any time of the day. Worth thinking about, though, if you\u2019re a light sleeper. Our room was advertised and booked (via Airmiles) as a double, but actually turned out to be a twin. Although the plinth was one piece, the mattresses and bedding were for two single beds and not a double but this meant we didn\u2019t steal each others bedding! The toilet, which is completely separate from the shower and sink, was bright and tiled with large ceramic tiles. The shower and sink area, (separated by a sliding, opaque door from the bedroom area) is beautifully tiled in granite and well lit. The shower cubicle itself which has a glass shower door, not a curtain, is quite spacious. A hair dryer is provided here too. A wardrobe (a few more coat hangers would have been useful!), dressing table and chair, bedside table and a stool complete the rest of the furniture. There is a flat screen TV (with BBC World & CNN providing English language channels) and air-conditioning. The windows are large and can be opened making the room bright and open. Access to our room was through two doors. The first door opened from the hotel corridor to what could be described as a very small lobby, with two further secure doors giving access to two individual rooms. This arrangement may well be a bonus for families or groups travelling together. We had a couple of very minor issues with the room. The hotel provides a bottle of water in the room, with a \u20ac2 price tag attached. Don\u2019t bother opening it \u2013 there\u2019s nothing wrong with the water from the tap! Also, the room lacked any sort of tea / coffee making facilities, something which we really missed. Having said that, nothing we read about the hotel in advance suggested these facilities would exist, therefore, it\u2019s our fault for expecting it. Breakfast is provided on the ground floor in the open plan dining, bar and reception area. A selection of cereals, breads, fruit, tea / coffee / juice, scrambled eggs, sausage, and so on are provided on a buffet basis and we had no complaints at all with the choice or quality available. The hotel is just a two minute walk from the nearest U-Bahn station, Theodor-Heuss-Platz. This station is on one of the main lines (U2) so there\u2019s access to, for example, Postdamer-Platz and Alexandr-Platz without the need to change trains. However, as this station is near the end of the line it does take some travelling time to get anywhere \u2013 Postdamer-Platz is around 25 minutes away and Alexandr-Platz is around 40 minutes away. With Berlin\u2019s excellent public transport system we didn\u2019t mind being so far out from the centre, but this does need to be considered if you\u2019re heading anywhere with a deadline to meet, e.g. to meet up with an organised tour. The area immediately surrounding the hotel has a few restaurants, takeaways, decent coffee shop, supermarket, etc. and in our experience, felt perfectly safe. We had no trouble at all, even when returning to the hotel very late at night (although we didn\u2019t explore the surroundings much, only really walking back and forth from the hotel to the U-Bahn station). All in all a good place to stay and we would use it again if back in Berlin.", "Date": "July 8, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Ivbergs Hotel Berlin Messe", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d1186474-Reviews-Ivbergs_Hotel_Berlin_Messe-Berlin.html", "Price": "$59 - $260*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Heerstrasse 5</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">14057</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1186474", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/82/42/82428443d08ffc48eca53ea1e17bd4753large.jpg"}}
