{"Reviews": [{"Content": "A Comfortable Stay I stayed at this hotel for a week in Nov 2008. The tariff is very reasonable compared to Tokyo standards. The Staff are very courteous and efficient. The rooms , though small are very clean and well maintained. The hotel is centrally located and is very close to the Akasaka metro station. The entire street is filled with restaurants that offer all types of cuisine.The hotel provide Coffee and Bread for Breakfast as part of the deal.The only draw backs are that there is no Room service and the laundry has to be handed over to the Reception by the room occupant which I suppose is not a major cause for concern.Overall a very comfortable stay at this hotel and I would recommend this to business travellers visiting Tokyo whose budget is less than US $ 200 per day", "Date": "Nov 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR261107725", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "typhoon19572004"}, {"Content": "Great location - very new and stylish hotel       Inside of single room", "Date": "May 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR470498851", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "sportler"}, {"Content": "Great hotel! great location! This hotel is in a great location and very easy to get to all places you want to visit. It is very stylish and modern. The only downside is there is not much room to store your bags / clothes in the room if your a couple, however I think most hotels in cities are like this! You get free coffee and bottles of water which is gret. You also get a selection of breads in the morning. Overall a great place to stay!", "Date": "May 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR417954910", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "alexleon"}, {"Content": "Liked the Granbell Akasaka I stayed at the Granbell Akasaka and found it very nice.It is very conveniently located close to Akasaka Mitsuke tube station, in a nice street with lots of restaurants.Akasaka is not a huge shopping area, there are more bars and restaurants. Nonetheless there is a brand new small shopping mall. It is very conveniently located to reach most central areas of Tokyo.The room are nice, although the single room is very compact. Bed is comfortable, very stylish decor, and a great shower!", "Date": "Apr 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR563711174", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "MassiG"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066451-d1036724-r21928942-Akasaka_Granbell_Hotel-Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "1036724", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
