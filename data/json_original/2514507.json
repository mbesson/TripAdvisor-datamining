I tried t give him the card details but he said, I has to come in person and pay as they will not confirm with cards (I wanted to make the full payment at the time). Tried to tell them that I was a business and the customers will not actually be me so cannnot just travel to them to make a payment in person. They said they must do it this way.

If youre hoping to be closer to the center of the city - I would suggest one of the premier other locations. I noticed they did have some that were closer to Tower Bridge and in a closer location. The breakfast is an additional 10pounds per person. It honestly did not look like anything more than cereal and some juice and maybe some fruit.

It's biggest disadvantage is it is slightly outside the tourist zone if you want to easily walk to places and minimize tube and taxi. But this is London, you have to expect to take transport most places you go unless your like me, a walker. It was coming off the royal wedding when all hotels rooms were overpriced, and so paid as much as for a 4 star a week later. Having said that, it was priced better than the rest. Rooms were very clean and functional, and while not splashy, were modern in design, and slightly larger than comparable London hotels in this price range. Wifi is available at a fee. Front desk staff were very helpful, and their simple bus guide to access to the city was useful . Breakfast for the price was adequate and comparable to other places - not fine dining, but gets you going for the day. Be warned though, closest tube, is Elephant and Castle. With luggage, it is one to be missed, and trying to get a taxi outside is awkward. I found it better to get off at Waterloo and take a 10-12 GBP taxi ride to hotel, especially at night, or with bags.

I've stayed in tiny, overpriced rooms in Bayswater, and so I appreciated the really spacious and comfortable modern room that we got here. The bathroom was spotless and, incredibly, everything worked well. Even the hairdryer was good! We got an excellent deal on Booking.com so no matter how dire the hotel might be, we weren't complaining. Even at the standard rates displayed in the lobby (GBP 99 per night for a double) it would have been ok. BUT: the hotel is really far away from Tower Bridge and you can't walk from the nearest tube (Elephant and Castle) because it's not a nice stroll through pretty streets, it's a long walk through absolutely miserable and honestly spooky areas. This is not a nice area of town. We had to take a taxi to the tube station every time, so if you stay here, only do it because you've got such an amazing deal that you can splash out on taxis all the time. We paid GBP 39 per night for our room, so we could get away with it, but deals like that are rare, and we were very lucky. The staff were reserved and quiet, but did help us with small things that we asked for; just don't expect huge smiles and \"Receptionist of the Year\" material. The room was either freezing or boiling, we never managed to suss out the air conditioning system so it was on and off all the time, and the windows were locked so no fresh air was available. Mind you, the street was so noisy that you can forget sleeping with the window open anyway - there were ambulances, police cars and fire trucks rocketing along the road every 10 mins or so all night long. Yep, bring ear plugs or get a room facing the back. We bought a good English breakfast at Elephant and Castle (by the tube) at Wetherspoon's for half the price of the hotel breakfast. I would never stay at the hotel alone as a female traveller, but travelling with others it was ok. (There's a Chinese/Sezchuan restaurant with access from the hotel lobby. The food was very good, very authentic, but NB: like a handful of other places in London, they slapped on a service charge of 10 %, not stated anywhere on the menu or otherwise, which annoyed us.) All in all, the hotel itself was excellent value by London standards (even if you're paying the standard rate) and it was surprisingly clean, modern and comfortable. It's just a real shame that it's placed in such a horrible spot and is so far from the tube. There is a bus stop just outside the hotel, but the buses take longer in London traffic and are harder for tourists to negotiate than the very user-friendly tube.

If you fall into this category, then you might want to CONSIDER the Premier Inn by Eurotraveller. Now that London has the visitor oyster card, getting to this hotel is not so bad. Its closest Tube Stop is Elephant & Castle (which has a lovely market with good Jamaican Jerk Chicken, Ethiopian Food, sometimes Traditional Hungarian Food, Smoothies, and cheap stuff ...). From there, good luck finding New Kent Road, but when you do, take one of the many buses that go to Old Kent Road (there are two bus stops close to each other, and you wait at the SECOND bus stop). It's about a 5 minute bus ride to the hotel. The area is not as cute as London, but it's not dangerous, and there is a nice mixture of people. The hotel, as I said before, is inexpensive. If two of you decide to sleep in a double room for one, then it's 89 pounds a night, and the room is really small. The air conditioning is extremely strong, however, which is GREAT for the hot summer days. Somehow they managed to squeeze an ironing board and an iron into the \"cabin\" (as it's labeled), and it works in 18-minute increments (don't know where they came up with that unit of time). The staff was quick to help us when we had problems - clog in the shower, needed an extra coffee/tea mug, air conditioner seemed broken (but our card was not deep enough into the slot), internet code not working, needed more soap, etc ... The only real issue was noise from a live-band night at the local Guatemalan restaurant, and the high-high price for internet. If you choose to get the 2pound hour internet, know that it is cumulative and not consecutive, meaning you can use 20 minutes, then use the rest later ... etc ... Also, it seems like this place SELLS a lot of things that should be free, and does not offer some things that a hotel should have; they did not have a sewing kit, and they sell ice ... TV was good, safe worked very well ... coffee was not good according to my husband, tea was okay with milk and sugar. It was an average, mediocre hotel. If you like walking (like me) and not paying for internet (like me), you can pick up a signal at either the Art Cafe (about a 25 minute walk away on London Road, shorter if you take the bus), or get free Wi-Fi at Del'Aziz or The Table (highly recommended).

Hotel was clean, airy, very modern and most importantly, this extended to the room, and was not just a reception facade. 4 adults in a 4 bed 'cabin' room with two singles and a double. PLENTY of room to move around, not falling over each other! Facilities excellent! 32\" plasma with Freeview on the wall, Iron and fold away ironing board, hairdryer, mini fridge, international sockets. If I HAD to make negative comments : Shower curtain too short, water goes on floor! No extra plug socket next to mirror for straighteners or your own hair dryer.

The Hotel itself has recently been refurbished and is very hip and trendy, the rooms were of good size and fitted out to a much higher standard than the price charged. Each room had a 6 jet power shower, unfortunately one jet was directed right up the Jacksey. The staff were helpful and friendly and all in all better than many more expensive hotels we have stayed at in London.

Local ameneties i.e food not so great however bus stops right near hotel entrance and it's a 24hr bus service, not too expensive in a taxi either to centre of London-we were \u00a314. People in local grocers very nice and helpful and sell the all day bus tickets which are great. Area not much to look at but I felt safe enough. My shower wasnt working so I had to move rooms after first night-staff were very helpful. Large TV on wall which had built in freeview-great. Kettle supplied in room for tea/coffee. Small fridge supplied in room. Only downside no wardrobe! Only a small clothes rail with few hangers on it. DO NOT use the Chinese adjoined to the building, worst meal i've ever had!! However my parents liked the food in Ozzies cafe just a few doors down. I recommend you eat before returning to hotel as local amenities are a bit scarce. There is a Tesco just along the road from hotel. Also people had chinese takeaway meals delivered to hotel from elsewhere which hotel staff were ok with and supplied plates, cutlery etc. If your looking for an above average hotel (I loved it and can be fussy) then this is it but I definetely recommend it and would return.", "Date": "January 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool", "Title": "\u201cWould stay there again!\u201d", "Author": "LiverpoolMother", "ReviewID": "UR19584539", "Content": "I was very happy with my stay, we stayed in a family room, with a 1yr old.

Taps in the bathrrom only pore water if you bend over and are close enough will automatically come on and you get soaked. The shower is small and an issue for anyone trying to have a wash! No bar - well it's part of reception and not inviting. The dining area is not comfortable and cold and bland in the morning. The walk from Elephant and Castle is long around 20 mintues and with a bag not good. Also, the hotel is not in a nice area. The hotel doesn't have an evening restaurant and will invite pizza and chinese companies to deliver take aways. There are no local restaurants I would feel comfortable in - carribean run restaurants, I saw gangs on the streets and went swiftly back to the hotel. Traffic is a huge issue in the morning and delays if you have meetings. The bed was comfortable and have flat screens but feel they have cut corners all over the place to save money and has had a detrimental feeling to comfort and a relaxing ambience.
