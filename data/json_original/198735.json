Shower was nice. Our room was not very small, I can not complain. The hotel in centrally located, however I would have liked to be a little closer to the Spanish Steps. Breakfast was included in our deal and was great. The drinks in the small fridge of the room were also included. We were welcomed to the hotel with great-tasting espresso and cappuccino. My wife and I are walkers, therefore we hardly used any motorized transportation. We were able to walk everywhere and back most of the time. But what made the difference and made this review five stars is the customer-centric staff of the hotel. Hospitality Manager Simona Rongione was very helpful in every phase of our stay.

Such was the case with the Hotel Britannia. Some of the reviews mention that the rooms are small and that is undeniably true, but they are extremely comfortable, clean and everything works just as it should. Our bed was a little on the hard side of firm, but that seems to be usual for Italy. The hotel arranged a transfer from the airport for us and our driver was there waiting for us (collar and tie job) with a Mercedes E300 for just 10 euros more than the standard taxi fare - and a lot less hassle. Reception at the hotel was like we were old time friends - offered a drink while our bags were taken to our room - the sort of small detail that is just so rare. It is very obvious that this is a family run business that takes a pride in what it does and cares for its customers. All the staff spoke fluent English (and from what we overheard, plenty of other languages as well). Other than an Italian accent, some of them you would think were native English speakers. Recommendations for dinner were freely available and good - even a phone call to check there would be room and to expect us. Breakfast was a huge spread - hot eggs and bacon, cold meat, cheese, cereals, breads, etc and fresh fruit. Really nice coffee too and (shock, horror!) English tea. Location is pretty good too, an easy walk to Termini station or Piazza Republicca (metro at both) and all the tour buses start nearby. We were very pleased with our choice, having booked and prepaid for a week it could have gone badly wrong, but worked out perfectly. If you are looking for a friendly and characterful hotel, you won't go far wrong. We thoroughly enjoyed our week and would have no hesitation in recommending and our first choice if we go back to Rome.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cA perfect Hotel in a good location with excellent staff\u201d", "Author": "Mad-dog-71", "ReviewID": "UR126949961", "Content": "Hotel Britannia is a great hotel ideally located for anyone wishing to visit Rome.

Also there is bacon, eggs and sausage and various other hot options as well as the usual tea coffee and various fruit juices. You won't be hungry this is a well appointed breakfast.

I usually would avoid staying around the train station area, but wanting to join a tour of the Tivoli & Hadrian's Villa the next day, prompted me to stay near the Termini. Upon a short 38 minutes train ride from Orte, we simply stroll in front of the Termini station, turning on the 3rd left turn, ie on Via Viminale. Then, its walking straight on, turning on our 4th right, ie Via Napoli. The charming boutique Hotel Britannia is on our right. Having reserved the roof top Junior suite, room 403, purportedly the largest room in the Hotel, we were offered cookies, tea and drinks as complimentary from the charming, Carmen. As it was 9am, our suite wasn't ready, so off we go to shop for handicrafts. Taxi ranks are nearby on the Piazza della Republicca or check if they are queueing for customers at the nearby Hotel Quirinale (esp. after siesta, at around 3-4pm). Fortunately, we did our shopping on a Friday as the next day, Rome was paralyzed by strikes - roads were closed and there were lots of policemen standing guard. Back to our suite, on first look, I was a tad disappointed by its size as online pictures had made it look bigger. However, once in it for sometime, you will realize that it is indeed quite spacious and very comfortable. The icing on the cake has to be its private terrace (with furniture) as well as a fully marble bathroom with jacuzzi tub. Even in mid October, there were two air-con units in the suite, both functioning quite well! Everything in the suite worked - bed was comfy but its left side (facing the terrace) is a little sagged, not too bad though; lots of storage space; medium sized flat screen TV with English channels; ironing board (iron must be requested from Reception and we didn't bother); ironing press; water boiler with free tea and coffee bags; safe; free Wifi near the door (great as we have our Ipad with us); free Wine from our package; fruits in the corridor; turn down service with next day's weather forecast etc. And what amazes me was, the breakfast next morning. Served in a frescoed area as well as the charming English bar area, food was both varied and delicious! You not only get scrambled eggs, bacon, lots of melon and pineapple, you also get the rarely seen Italian ommelete and fresh mushrooms - YUMMY! The 3 staff that we had encountered was all genuinely helpful and nice, Carmen, Maddalena and Enrico. Even the housekeeping and an old gentleman who helps with our luggage were all super friendly Though there was slight renovation works at an ancient palazzo next door (October, 2011) we were not bothered by noise as the suite was set back a little from the front and onto the side of the Hotel's small parking lot. Needless to say, we slept blissfully well during our two nights there. Two small glitches here - the interior sound proofing between rooms and its corridors leaves much to be desired! Parents, if you are travelling with your kids, please ask them not to sing at 10.30pm! Another would be an Italian thingy - pillows are hopelessly flat! Always have to add one or two layers of bath towels underneath it. Overall, if not for its location further away from what Rome has to offer, this charming Hotel actually would be our frequent place to stay in Rome. But fret not, as a walk to the Spanish steps via a short cut is only about 15-20 minutes, or simply 6.50 euros by cab. Enjoy this charming and good value Boutique hotel near the Termini in Rome. It is indeed a solid 4 stars, no doubt about it, but do book at least a Superior room here as they might come with small terraces, eg room 402. Taxi transfer to the airport in a large van like vehicle was 50 euros. Arranged through the Hotel's Signore Enrico, it was both on time and efficient.

Francesca, of the reservation department is friendly and professional. She offered tips for our city tour although we had done most of the research.

The staff were always friendly and efficient, and those at the front desk were able to speak English very well. The hotel is centrally located about a 10m walk west of Termini station, which makes it closer to the main tourist sites to the west of the downtown. One of the highlights of this hotel was its breakfast: It put any breakfast I've had in a North American hotel to shame. The breakfast was more of a brunch than anything. You had the usual toast, coffee/espresso, eggs, bacon, but you also had some amazing fresh fruit, tonnes of pastries, cookies and cakes, prosciutto, cheeses, etc., even some sort of rice and mushroom dish which I didn't try. The dining room looked rather fancy and neat as well for such a small hotel. The waiters were always quick too. Overall, this hotel was excellent. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.

We chose it because of the great location, the fact it was rated four stars, and it was not too crazy expensive. (Approx. 200 euro a night). We arrived from a cruise ship, so we were there at 11am. To our astonishment, we were given a room right away. (We figured we would have to just leave our bags and come back later.) The front desk staff was efficient and polite. They have a good command of the English language. The room was quite large for Rome. The bathroom had a bathtub! The tub was quite narrow, but I am a small person, 5 foot 2 inches and only 120 lbs, so I fit fine. One tip for a shower here is to leave the curtain half way open otherwise it will keep flying back on you! Hot water was NEVER an issue here. (We have had issues in the past while in Italy, so this was good). The room only has approx. 7 hangers, not much for two people. You may be able to get more, but I never asked. The fish tank in the bedroom is a great feature! My biggest problem with this hotel, and the only reason I did not give it a higher overall rating was the bed and pillows; mainly the pillows really. The bed was hard, and if your partner moves, you will feel it. The pillows are WORTHLESS. I ended up with a stiff neck on the third night that never went away until I got home and to my own pillow and heating pad. (And by stiff, I mean stiff.) It is important to know that this hotel is across the street from an Irish pub. The pub while a good place to eat and drink, especially at lunch when their prices are competitive, gets VERY noisy some nights. We had to close our window several nights. With that said, the hotel windows are very good at keeping out the sound. The breakfast is okay. The eggs were runny, and the breakfast sausage is a wiener! The bacon is good, but salty. The mushrooms and rice at breakfast is weird, but quite tasty!!! The croissants were yummy. The fresh fruit is very good. I loved the coffee, it was very strong. They serve it with warm milk!

The furnishings in the room were very dated (old) and looked more like the furnishing from a very low-class hotel; the carpeting was worn out and faded. We were told we had free Satellite TV in the room, but our TV (a very old thing the size of a 12x12 inch computer monitor) did not have more than a French news channel, a commercials-laden RTL station in German (luckily I understand German but was sick of watching commercials and infomercials all day long). I asked for help and the staff member who came to our room couldn't find anything more than a BBC station, the rest was PAY TV. etc... The staff was at all times very polite and helpful. From the Breakfast servers (good breakfast buffet) to front desk and the porters, everyone was very nice and pleasant. The only exception was the day of departure. Upon arrival, we were asked if we'd pay with credit card or with cash in exchange for a 10% discount, and we said we'd probably pay cash, the receptionist told us it really didn't matter that much to nail it down. On the day of departure, we did not have enough cash and I offered to pay a part in cash and the balance with a credit card. The receptionist, Cesare, refused and was quite upset and kept repeating that we had promised to pay in cash! He made no effort to conceal his disdain and anger over that issue.

The colloseum is spectacular and again about 15 mins walk. We took a bus to the Vactican as it is a bit further out of the town, there are buses everywhere so you dont have too wait long.

Location was assessable to tour buses, shopping & restraunts. We did get another 10% discount if we payed cash & we had already recieved an online early booking discount. Parking on site good but only space for half dozen cars. However; $520.00EUR (2nights) - 1 x Classic double room, 1xSun lamp in the room (dusty shade in the corner), 1xFruit basket (not in the room outside the lift for everyone), 1x up grade (From what?), 2xWireless connection free, 2xwelcome drink (If you ask for it), 2xAmerican Buffet Breakfast (Average quality), 1xParking. Far too expence for the experience we recieved. The Room let itself down the safe malfunctioned & was open when we got back from the day, there was a white powder all over the floor because it caked my socks, the walls were paper thin I could hear everything including the kids next door playing & yelling for 2 days including the door bell & the light shone through the vent all night. Bathroom was average but clean but the shower a nightmare to use & maintain temp. It must of backed onto the bathroom of the room next door because you could hear everything going on next door. Breakfast atmosphere non existent it had half a spread but the quality was poor. I had a yoghurt & just about lost it because it was off I tried complaining but english was not there strengths. The bacon I think micowaved it tasted looked plastic & the mushrooms were just slimy & tasted like the day before. I noticed no one had touched it. No music in the dinning room I might as well been eating in my basement. The waiter looked really aggitated every time I got up to get something or used another utensil or plate. He just wasnt friendly. Probably the sadest breakfast experience we had. Getting to the hotel do not do in a car. To get there you have to drive up a one way street with traffic going in the opposite direction. You have to drive in the taxi/bus only lane. Miss the turn off & you lose another 20mins. The hotel is located down a lonely dark alleyway you would never guess. Overall not a experience of a lifetime.

Believe the reviews! The location is a hop, skip and a jump from the main train station (Stazione Termini), and gives easy access to all major points of interest in the city. We didn't spend a dime on taxis, and walked, walked, walked everywhere. The Forum, Colesseum, Spanish Steps, and Pantheon were all a short trek away. For the less fit seeking more remote attractions, there was a Metro station a couple of blocks away. Internet access is provided free of charge, and there is a small room, complete with computer, just off the lounge, near the reception area. The Hotel has a couple of neat, little amenities, including a pair of live goldfish in each bathroom (we named ours Fred & Wilma in honour of the Flintstones' 50th anniversary) and rubber duckies in the bath. We celebrated a wedding anniversary during our stay, and the management sent up complimentary champagne, which was a very nice touch. The Britannia is a boutique style hotel tucked away just off the Via Nazionale. The rooms are bright and clean, with high ceilings and comfortable beds but, as with any older hotel, the bathrooms could use a little updating. The rooms are small by North American standards but, hey, it's just a place to sleep. We weren't expecting to be able to play tennis in there! My wife and I stayed in room 203 during our first week in Rome, and then again in room 102 on our final night before flying home, after spending a week in Positano. Room 102 was the better of the two, but the bathroom was not a nice. A full breakfast each morning is included. As mentioned by another review, the Britannia provided a relatively quiet stay in noisy Roma, although nothing could mask the sirens from those Italian ambulances, which seem to rule the streets in Rome. Our new best friend, Mario, who worked the early evenings at the desk, was terrific when it came to steering us in the right direction. We were looking for a quick dinner one evening, and he directed us to a little hole in the wall at the end of Via Napoli, minutes from the hotel. It didn't look like much at first, but it was great!! Mario always had a smile, and a funny story, whenever we stopped to chat. Both he, Maddelena the day receptionist, and Emilio and Lee John in the breakfast room, made our stay warm and enjoyable.

We finally chose the Hotel Britannia, based mainly on online reviews, and we were very happy with our selection. Everything about the hotel was very good, but the two best things were the hotel staff and the location. As you can see on the map, the hotel is located on Napoli just off National. National is a major and very busy (read noisy) street but Napoli is narrow and very quite. From the hotel we were easily able to walk to most of the major sites with the exception of the Vatican and the Pantheon was a bit far (but we did walk). It is also only a couple blocks from the main train/subway station so it is possible to walk to or a cheap cab ride when checking in/out. The other thing we were happiest with was the entire hotel staff. They were extremely helpful in recommending restaurants (even making reservations for us, Thanks Mario!), times and sites to visit, and answering/addressing every additional question. The all speak English, but we found them and other locals in general, to be much more responsive when we at least tried to speak Italian. On the only slightly down side, we were were a little surprised at the size of the actual room. The king size bed took up nearly all the room and the closet was a little small, but the bathroom was surprisingly large and extremely nice. The room really wasn't a huge issue, because we spent most of the time site-seeing and exploring all that Rome has to offer. Additionally, there was only one English speaking TV channel. A few more would have been nice at the end of the day. The Internet access was also included and was nice to have, but by no means was it super fast. The breakfast was also included and very nice, plus it was available until 10 a.m. which was nice on the mornings after the late nights when we had too much vino.

By North American standards the rooms are small but by European standards the room size is ample (I've stayed in smaller hotels elsewhere). Other reviewers mentioned that the TV is old and small.... but you're in Rome!!!! what are you doing watching television!? Rome is such a vibrant, buzzing city with so much happening all day and through the night. The hotel offers a good buffet breakfast. A good assortment of cold and hot options and a server to bring a fresh pot of coffee. I would highly recommend including the breakfast with your stay. You can leave the hotel with a full belly and plenty of energy to see you through to supper. The front desk is very friendly and helpful with any advice or guidance you may need. The hotel is in a charming older building. It is a 4 storey structure with a small elevator and a narrow winding staircase. The age and character of the building made the stay more interesting. The hot water was very hot, the water pressure was good and the rooms were spotless. WIFI is also available through the hotel (you need to ask front desk for username and password) Another nice touch is the fruit bowls to be found on every floor; filled with pears, apples peaches & plums.

Really close to subway - two blocks, 3 min to take you to see Forum and museum or elsewhere. Far enough from the crowds of the Main Railroad Station. Do not get a rental car there, quite a hassle to drive around Rome - you are not even supposed to pick your luggage from the hotel as you do not have permit to drive around. take a train and get it wherever you go. If yo do not order GPS in advance they do not have any. Buses run on Via Nazionalle to get you closer to downtown if you do not feel like walking. It is 10 min walk to the big fountain and 15 to Pantheon. Many restaurants on the way or further north if you walk that direction. Taxi takes you back for less than 10 euros.

My first disappointment was with our room and the increased cost in comparison to my two family members' room...they were given an 'upgrade' and ours was a low grade for more money...40 Euros per night more for basically the same room. The TVs which were supposedly upgrades did not work properly, nor did the internet in our room. We did not get the 'turn down service' both nights (only one night) but the other room did! When we went to the bar in the hotel lobby at 10 min. to 11 pm. no one asked if we might like anything, and when I enquired after 11 pm. they told me it was closed! Three people were on staff at the front desk and no one asked if we might like anything from the bar when we arrived, nor 'just before it was supposedly closed'. When we inquired about our room, we were told it was 'the luck of the draw'...they were fully booked and if we were to move we might get a lower grade room for the same price my family were paying for their room....Just did not seem logical let alone fair. To top it off, on check out, we were told we had a laundry bill! We did not do any laundry as we were only in Rome for two days...they did credit this, but I think they thought we were mistaken!!! Breakfast was the only other good thing about the hotel.

I must say that I'm disappointed after my stay. When I researched hotels, I thought I was getting a deal for a 4-star hotel for under 200 Euro a night! I figured it must be that price because it was near Termini, which is not necessarily the prime area to stay in Rome. I also thought I was staying in a place that was going to be romantic, modern, and clean. I'm likely to offend the hotel owners/staff with my comments, but this is not a 4-star hotel. I've had better accommodations at 2-star hotels in the U.S. than this place. We stayed in room 402 (the room with the Rose painting and terrace on the hotel's website). On the website, the hotel and accommodations looked sheik, modern and romantic. Upon arrival, my wife and I saw that it was nothing like the pictures. Instead, it was going to be a no-frills place to just lay a head before shipping off to the airport. We in fact went out to dinner that night and drank an excessive amount to ensure that we would just pass out once we got back to the hotel. I would not stay here again because of the reasons listed below. Furthermore, if you are a U.S. resident and on a honeymoon, I would definitely not stay here because it is not romantic, it's in a lackluster area of Rome, and there are nicer places for the same price range or less in the same area. My reasons why this is not a 4-star hotel (which in my mind would be one star below at St. Regis): -The last time the hotel was renovated had to have been in the late 1980's or early 1990's; the website shows one awesome looking room with shelves above the bed. That room must be the best room in the place because the others don't look like that. The breakfast area has the same story. -No wash cloths in the bathroom -The room was infested with ants. The ants had free reign of the bathroom (toilet, sink, tub, door), the carpet and the bed. -The safe was from 1980 and was malfunctioning. -The car service arranged through the hotel was a run down Kia minivan. We could have caught a taxi to the airport for less than 50 Euro and at least rode in a run down Mercedes. Seems like a 4-star hotel would have better managed that aspect. -The breakfast spread is pretty basic with limited selection compared to other 4-star hotels where we stayed. -The wooden head board on the bed had what appeared to be termite damage (or some other type of wood eating organism). -The mattress was hard. Honestly, the other hotel we stayed in for the first part of our trip in Rome, Hotel Madrid, which is a 3-star hotel, had nicer accommodations. It was at least clean. If I had to rate this hotel, I'd say it would be a 3-star hotel on it's best day.", "Date": "June 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel, great service & good central location\u201d", "Author": "HerculeP", "ReviewID": "UR67457711", "Content": "From the moment that we arrived we knew that we had made the right choice.

A wide range of complimentary fruit was available in the hall, and we were amazed to find tea/coffee making facility in the room (rare in an Italian hotel). The air condition worked perfectly but our only slight criticism was that the hot water could have been warmer. As other reports have stated, the breakfast was very good with a very wide choice (pastries and cakes were too sweet, but it is Italy afterall). Vast choice of local restaurants providing everything from fast food to very upmarket meals, and prices were quite reasonable. The location couldn't be better, where you can stroll to all the major attaractions within 15 minutes. In addition it's less than 5 minutes from the main railway station (we used the hotel's own transfer back to the airport which was excellent for a reasonable 50euros).

(However, DON'T try to get there by Metro from Termini - you're better off walking or - probably - getting a cab, though these are expensive in Rome). We stayed for 5 nights in November and it was a perfect spot for exploring the city. The hotel is quiet, even though it's only around 100 metres from a busy main road. The Anglican church of St Pauls Within the Walls is next door, and is beautiful inside (especially the mosaics and marble pulpits), and hosts lots of classical music concerts. The rooms are not spacious, but perfectly adequate for a city break to Rome. Our 'view' was of a quiet, private side alley - OK, not overly pretty, but then you don't need a view with the whole of Rome on your doorstep. Our room was reasonably well appointed with TV (if you need one), mini-bar, tea & coffee-making facilities, a safe, a chair, a stool, bedside cabinets with a single drawer each and a moderate-sized wardrobe/closet. (There's nowhere to stow suitcases, so take a bag that'll squash pretty flat and slide it uder the bed). There's an OK bathroom with a bidet, and a small fish-tank with 3 fish in it ! The bath has a fixed (rather weak) shower and a separate spray nozzle. Beware, the taps are confusing - the red one fills the bath, the blue ones control the pressure of the 2 showers. Oh, and every bathroom has a complimentary rubber duck! There's free wireless internet - with good service - in the rooms and public areas. The lift is tiny - room for 3 people max or 1 person and 2 suitcases. The stairs are also very narrow, so if you're very large, you may have problems getting to your room! (If you're that big, you'll have problems getting to the hotel - Rome makes few allowances for anyone with mobility issues. Even getting on and off the Leonardo Express between the airport and the city with a suitcase is tricky if you're not reasonably fit and slim!) Breakfasts are excellent. Fresh fruit, a good selection of cereals, fresh walnuts and delicious prunes, a nice range of cold meats & cheeses, bakery goods, plus cooked food including crispy bacon, herby tomatoes and mushrooms, and of course very good coffee. (The only problem is the lack of spoons for cereals, etc - a small but slightly irritating oversight). There's also a bowl of fruit on the landing, so you can take an apple, orange or plum back to your room. We found the service to be very good and friendly from all the staff. They were obliging in printing our boarding passes for the return trip and giving us advice and directions. There were just a couple of things that would improve the hotel. We found the cleaning of the bathrooms somewhat haphazard - soap marks around the basin were still there when we returned after a day's sightseeing, the towels we had elected to re-use were exactly as we'd left them, not re-folded and tidied, etc. (We mentioned this to the guy on reception, and it did improve on our last day - but not much). Also, we'd rather have a shower cap in the bathroom than a rubber duck! Overall, we found the Britannia to be a very good hotel, conveniently located and with nice, attentive service. A couple of minor tweaks would improve it still further. A couple of points - if you want to vivit the Villa Borghese, book in advance. Even though the gallery was almost empty (certainly by UK standards), they wouldn't sell us tickets on the day. The 'Roma Pass' may help, but we didn't think it was worth the money. The Metro is good for the Colosseum and sort of alright for the Vatican (a long walk), but useless for (say) the Pantheon, the Castell Saint Angelo, and (if you've heard of it and can be bothered to make the trek up there), the Tempietto in Gianicolo. Check carefully when everything is open - we saw the Sistene Chapel on the Thursday, but it was (apparently) closed on the Friday, Saturday and Sunday. If you're going this time of year, don't listen to the touts selling you expensive guided tours of the Vatican The lines were non-existent, it closed at 5:30 (NOT 1:45 as advertised) and we spent 5 hours inside - not the 2.5 hours the tours offer. What's more, we found the Sistene Chapel fascinating, but you don't need an hour there. The Map Gallery was, for us, even more spectacular. So save your money, and spend \u20ac7 each on an audio guide, and another \u20ac7 on the exhausting but amazing climb up the dome of St Peter's.", "Date": "November 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "PHILADELPHIA", "Title": "\u201cgood location, clean, very nice breakfast\u201d", "Author": "FLYERS49", "ReviewID": "UR49193832", "Content": "We stayed here on a vacation to Rome.

Rooms are not large but perfectly adequate & well furnished and finished - this is a city centre hotel after all and is a converted noble residence. Wonderful buffet breakfast with a wide choice of both hot and cold dishes, cereals, juices, tea & coffee. Apart from Enrico, we were also well looked after by Francesca and Mario - these three rotate on front of house and are all helpful, charming and polite. So pleasant to be looked after by people like this in a city where there is plenty of scope to be ripped off.

If you like walking you can easily get to many of the standard attractions by foot, otherwise it is easy to catch a bus nearby. Next door is an Anglican church which holds concerts. Upon checking in you are treated to a complimentary hot drink - I took a Cappuccino and my wife had a hot chocolate - just what we needed considering the cold outside. I had asked for an early checkin (nominal time 13:00), and indeed a room was available for us at 10:00. Our room was one of the few with a balcony, which was definitely a plus despite the cold weather. The room was relatively small but comfortable and with plenty of light. There is a minibar refrigerator and an electric kettle, and the coffee and teabags (including my wife's favorite - Earl Gray) are provided daily. We had to ask for the sheets not to be changed daily, and if you are out late the room is checked again and hard candies placed on the pillows. Every morning a printed 1-page world-news review is slipped under the door, and in the evening a handwritten card with the next day's weather and sunset time. There is essentially no lobby, just the 8-table breakfast room, the 4 table bar area, and a small niche. On each floor there is a corner with a sofa and a small table with fresh fruit. The WiFi coverage was less than satisfactory. The entrance floor has a WPA-secured network which worked well, but the other floors were covered by a single access point with a limited number of IP-address leases. In our room the signal strength was often very low, and the connection would drop after 10 minutes use. After such a drop I frequently could not reconnect due to there no longer being available leases.

The hotel is not a convenient 'home base.' Rooms: The hotel offers nicely appointed rooms for its price range. The bathroom was large for Europe. However, the walls are very thin.

It is within easy reach of Rome's main station and the Coloseum and is a good base for exploring the city. On arrival at the hotel we were given a drink and biscuits which was a nice touch and we were shown to our room and given an explanation of where everything was and how it all worked. We had a nice room with a balcony and my son loved the pet fish in the room. The breakfasts here are excellent and they have a particularly good selection for making your own cereal with lots of different nuts and dried friuts - although one word of caution - the dining room is small and so sometimes you have to wait for a table and if you still are eating your breakfast at 10am when it officially finishes the lights over the food go out! The area around the hotel seemed fine - especially the Via Nationale end where there are some good shops and restaurants. If you are staying at this hotel I would not advise eating at the Irish pub on the corner - we had a meal there on our first night and I had a beef dish - the meat was inedible - had I been in the UK I would have refused to pay for it! Also beware of prices at restaurants in key locations such as Piazza Navona - the prices of the main dishes are reasonable but they over charge for drinks and ice creams and you can end up with an extortionate bill for a mediocre meal - albeit in great surroundings. Finally I would like to add that I last stayed in Rome on my honeymoon in 1987 and the city has greatly improved over the last 19 years. It is much cleaner with less grafiti and there seemed to be less evidence of pickpockets and crime in general and a more visable police presence. A particular area that has improved is Termini station which used to be beset by pickpockets and is now much improved although still has a few beggers. Others improvements include Piazza Del Popolo which is no longer used as a car park and Rome zoo which has had a major facelift.", "Date": "August 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel\u201d", "Author": "CharEms", "ReviewID": "UR5525105", "Content": "A really lovely hotel, we booked through easyhotels(--) and had no problems at all.

I arrived around 10:30 p.m. and found Maddalena the receptionist and the night receptionist waiting to welcome me, concerned that I should have been there a few hours prior. A porter was available to carry my bags down the five or so stairs to the desk and up to street level the next day after checkout. My single room was small but quite lovely and accommodating to a single female traveler. The high ceilings helped. The bathroom was great - all mirrors, and had the wonderful added touch of a fish tank with a lone fish to keep me company. Breakfast was more like lunch, with eggs, bacon, assorted cold meats, fruit, rolls, and salads. Very good, and all in all a great experience - I wish I could have spent more time there. The hotel is approximately 10-15 minutes walking distance from Stazione Termini. I walked from the station (since the airport ATMs would not accept my bank card & I had a very limited amount of Euros for a cab). Although it was around 10 p.m. and the streets did not have many pedestrians, I felt relatively safe. I had to stop twice to ask directions because I couldn't find the street signs I was looking for. Everyone I asked was extremely kind and helpful, with one hotel desk clerk watching me until I got to the end of his street and an Internet store clerk walking me around the block to Via Napoli & offering to walk me down the end of it to the hotel. However, I suggest taking a cab from the station at night. The hotel is few blocks from the Piazza de la Repubblica, with shops & other conveniences close by. I had a good pasta meal with wine at the Irish pub on the corner of Via Napoli for less than 18 Euro. Yes, no Irish food there, just the pub atmosphere & good Italian fare.", "Date": "July 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison, NJ", "Title": "\u201cConvenience and Service in Rome\u201d", "Author": "cindybelm", "ReviewID": "UR5393228", "Content": "Stayed here with my family June 7-9, 2006.
