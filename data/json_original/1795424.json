Place itself is nothing fancy, the whole place had a musty smell about it. Small bed rooms, small bathrooms. If you just want a place to sleep and if you're not too fussy, this is the place for you. It is economical, well located and easy to travel to and from. We only stayed here 2 nights, so it was OK, wouldn't recommend it you need to stay longer than 2 nights! It was run by the cutest little couple, they were really really old and the husband seemed to be doing most of the cleaning, they are wonderful, but do not speak much English.
