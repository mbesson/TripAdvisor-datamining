When booking this trip, I knew it would be more of a boutique hotel (not the big all-inclusive style you see in most of Mexico). I was happy with the location of the hotel and the ammenities (Gym, Beach, Free Breakfast, Excursion Coordinator.) If we go back to Playa I would stay here again. It was nice to have security that asked us if we were staying there - it made us feel safe (contrary to all the police with huge machine guns walking around the town.) My one complaint would be the door locks in our condo. We stayed in 303 and the \"lock\" was seriously a hole in the door that you open with a screw driver looking key! We didn't bring any serious valuable that we couldn't fit in the safe, but still -even with the door \"locked\" with a good shove I could totally open the door that should be locked. Lucikly we didn't have any problems but when we asked the front desk if we could change rooms they said no. Our room was not in the beach side condos but the ones across the little street. We actually liked this because there was a nice quite pool and hot tub outside out room that we could use at night. The service at the beach was great - we were always able to get a chair (except when we showed up at 3pm after an all day excursion) and the service was nice. Drinks and food were reasonable so it made it easy to sit at the beach all day! I organized transportation to and from the airport through BestTransfers.

I missed breakfast two days because I needed to go before 8:00 am. Clubs noise. I was in condo 311 at beach side property. The noise is not loud, you can sleep easily in this condo. The noises sound far and if you turn on the fan of the AC the sounds are muted. The units are awesome, very clean and spacious. The property is really beautiful and well maintained. You will impress when enter to this place. Every room has a private balcon nad is very spacious. I liked more the beachside property because its more jungle themed and private than the oceanfront. The pool in the Beachside was very private and bigger compared to the pictures. What stand up is the location, you can walk to almost every place in playa. The 5th avenue is only two blocks, and the best clubs are 1 block from El taj. We go out every night for dinner and drinks, everyone can get drunk and walk way back to the hotel.

The grounds are beautiful, the pool is well kept and it's conveniently located near the many great restaurants, bars and shops of Playa Del Carmen. So what's not to like? I'm glad that you asked. Let's start at the beginning -- that photo you see at the top of the page is not even accurate. It should have 30 fishing boats tied up along the beach. That's right, to enter the water from the beach ANYWHERE in front of the property, one must walk out in between dirty, smelly fishing boats. Those fishermen really seemed to be hauling in some impressive catches too. In fact, in spending a few days sitting in the beach chair one will see tons of huge fish being dragged up from the shore. Of course, one will also see their decapitated heads and rotting guts being dragged back down. One day, we even saw a bunch of heads and guts being thrown right back into the ocean from the shore. Needless to say, no one in our group got into the water. Many others have commented about the night club noise. Be advised -- this is 100% true. It is so loud that the A/C and fan going do not even come close to drowning it out. This doesn't just go on until midnight, 1 or even 3 AM. On our last morning there, our friends got up early to go see the sunrise and the club was still bumping at 6 AM. The level of service and convenience provided is also not up to par - takes forever, incorrect orders (or just meals missing altogether). Strict 8 AM towel and chair rule - so don't think you're going to be sitting on the beach any earlier than that. And you must always carry your wallet on you -- nothing can be charged to your room (not even room service), so you must always have some cash or a credit card on you at all times. So to recap -- this could be a fantastic property if they would move all the fishing boats away from the beach, make a deal with the night club owners or install sound proof windows, and add some convenient services like allowing guests to charge things to their rooms.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cUnrestricted luxury\u201d", "Author": "Livelykirk", "ReviewID": "UR125618748", "Content": "I have been to the El Taj twice and cannot say enough about the property and staff.

My wife and I were wanting to rent a condo or house. We had another couple joining us so this 2 bedroom, 2 bath met our needs. We decided on this unit due to the good reviews, the location as well as getting a very good rate through Greg (the owner)on VRBO.com. This development is nicely designed, furnished well and located within walking distance of all of 5th Ave. The management team was very responsive though I will say we are fairly low maintenance travelers. The management team and security personnel almost all spoke english well. Prior to leaving we had heard of some issues with loud music at night from the surrounding open air bars. This may very well be a huge issue for those seeking peace and quiet but I can honestly say it was not a big deal for us. We turned the A/C fan switch on at night and this muffled the noise enough that it was not so bothersome. I also understand management is attempting to resolve this issue through various means. Beyond this issue everything was as good or better than anticipated. This unit (Beachside) is not right on the beach (we knew that) but has a very nice heated pool and jacuzzi that we mostly had to ourselves. In some ways the location of this particular condo is better than those in the Oceanside portion of the development, particularly if you desire a little privacy. The beach is only steps away. The patio area was a real treat and having the ability to have other friends who were in the area come visit us at the condo was a big bonus. The house keeper also did an excellent job. We used the associated beach club several times and were pleased with the offerings and service. For those wishing to experience Playa Del Carmen on there own without the encumberance of an all inclusive I highly recommend El Taj and in particular condo 305.

By way of background, my wife and I typically stay at all-inclusives and have done so in Playacar, Cancun, Cabo and PV. So, we approached this vacation with a few concerns as it was outside of our comfort zone. Well, no more! I don't believe we have ever stayed at a more perfect resort than El Taj. We had incredible accomodations. Unit 345 is on the north side of the resort (more on that later) and is a three bedroom penthouse suite. The interior of the suite is first class, with lovely furnishings, artwork and appliances (all Bosch in the kitchen). There are 4 TVs in the unit plus a washer/dryer. Tile floorings, individual AC controls in each room and high end towels and sheets just add icing to the experience. Note: I believe that all of the units at El Taj are maintained to the same high standard. And, the views of the ocean from inside our unit or on the private balcony!! I thought this was enough but then we see that this unit has a large private deck upstairs with your own palapa, jacuzzi, barbecue, fridge and outdoor shower. This left us speechless - the views and ambiance are over the top. And, that was just the unit - El Taj has two beautiful pool areas ( you can use either the Oceanfront pool or the Beachside pool) and a jacuzzi pool. The exterior lobby/common areas are designed with an elegant Thai theme which is prevalent throughout. And, a restaurant on the beach! - something that I really value. You also have free access to a first class gym, for those of you that enjoy working out. We should also mention that El Taj Oceanfront has elevators. As we were travelling with friends that knew Playa del Carmen well, we really enjoyed the short walk to 5th Avenue and beyond, enjoying many of the fine local restaurants. Frankly, we did not miss the all-resort dining experience in the least. We would like to clarify some comments about the resort. One reviewer indicated that the water in the resort is not drinkable (complained about this and had to use the water dispenser supplied by the resort). The regular tap water in the unit is completely safe and I suspect that the dispenser being supplied by the resort to every unit is just another example of how far they go to make sure you enjoy your stay. Secondly, there have been some legitimate complaints about noise from the nearby nightclubs. No doubt they crank it up to ridiculous levels in the evening but we did not have any problems with this. As we were on the north side of the Oceanfront condos, on our balconies we only heard a very faint bass thump, and while inside the condo we heard nothing.

The resort is BEAUTIFUL! Our condo was large, on the ground floor, by the pool and the beach. The room was kept immaculate by the housekeeping staff. We loved having more room than a standard resort room at one of the all- inclusives. Daily Breakfast on the beach was a great way to start our day. Sitting in our clean and private poolside jacuzzi at sunset was awesome. I will never stay at a Playa all-inclusive again - this place has bigger rooms, better location to 5th Avenue and why get trapped eating mass- produced food at the all-inclusives when you can get a great meal for cheap on 5th Ave (for examble: Carboncitos!!!). We have been coming to Playa for 20 years, staying at a different place each time, but have settled on El Taj as the perfect combination of luxury, location, and staff. Special call-out to Juan Carlos down by the pool/beach club. He is a great guy who took care of our every need, sometimes before we even knew we needed it. We found the front desk to not be too responsive during our stay but Juan helped us every time we needed anything. Pros: Location on the beach but still close to the best part of 5th Ave. the north end of 5th is getting better and better. Resort is beautiful with plenty of condo elbow room - at night it's gorgeous but be careful on the stairs if you have had too many cervesas on 5th Ave! Resort cleanliness - great. Breakfast on the beach. Juan Carlos as mentioned. Beach walks, especially north. Included Health Club/ Gym is a real club with tons of equipment, free weights and classes - not some sweaty little room in a resort with a couple of lame treadmills. Two bathrooms. Cons Noise as others have mentioned on a couple nights - North side rooms are probably a little better - use your AC for white noise and the new windows that are being installed will surely help. The beach had been recently hit by a storm when we were there but I've heard it has been fixed/ leveled since then. I would recommend El Taj to anybody who wants to step up from the all-inclusive scene while still staying on the beach in a great place.

We stayed in the Beachside 302 which is the largest unit (8 people) for ten days at the end of January. El Taj has a wonderful location in the city and the condo is great. It met all of our needs except for the need to sleep, and all of the balconies were great! Plus the jacuzzi at the top was wonderful. First the positives: - The staff is wonderful and very helpful and gracious. The concierge staff (Theresa and Eduardo) go above and beyond in helping to make your stay wonderful and filled with many activities. They suggested trips that we were unaware of and had them planned to perfection. We also dealt with the front office staff and management and they were friendly and very helpful and listened to our concerns. - The location is great- we were able to walk to the main streets and around town with no problem and we were right across the street from the beach. - The facilities were great! The pools were all amazing, the pool chairs were comfy and the lounges were so nice! The negative: - Most of us were unable to sleep due to the clubs in the area. The music is loud (very loud- like you are in the club) and starts around ten and doesn't end unitl 5am. We talked extensively with the front desk staff and they were able to provide us with earplugs and they insisted that they were doing as much as they can. I guess it is a governmental issue that they have been fighting for awhile and we weren't the first visitors to experience this. All four bedrooms were really loud and while the earplugs did help, it never cut the noise. While this is not the fault of the hotel, it would have been nice have an idea of this problem beforehand! I would say go and enjoy the hotel but be prepared about the noise at night!

If you walk 500 yards or so, you'll find a better swimming area. If you're into swimming in at the beach, the pool is overlooks the ocean and is a great alternative. The rooms were the best part of this hotel. They were spacious and tastefully decorated. I would come back just to sleep in the rooms. As for the location, it is near the clubs of Playa Del Carmen so the noise can go until 4-5AM in the morning. It's not too bad if you're a heavy sleeper.

We went with two other couples, shared our oceanfront two bedroom condo with one couple and the other couple stayed in a unit beachside. We stayed in Unit 320 which is all the way in the back of the Oceanfront property. Although we could not see the ocean from every room the condo was so beautiful and elegantly decorated that it did not matter. Plus, we used the roof top for grilling, hot tubbing and sitting around having cocktails and from here you had a full ocean view! The master bedroom has a good size balcony with a table and 4 chairs. This faces the beachside property and has enough privacy to sit out with a cup of coffee in the morning and not be bothered. The spare bedroom has no usable balcony but a great view of the Sea. We had a full kitchen with everything you need and big living area. The unit also has a washer and dryer and TV's in everyroom. Unit 320 feels very private and we did not even need to close any curtains or blinds during our stay. The staff is wonderful! If we needed anything they were always there, extra towels, salt and pepper for cooking, shampoo etc. The concierge will set up all your excursions, dinner reservations etc easily and without hastle. I did not give this hotel an \"excellent\" rating only because our beach experience was not what we thought it would be. As I said El Taj is wonderful and I would go back to it in heartbeat but the beach club was a little loud and crowded. As some of the other reviews state you really cannot swim in front of El Taj. It is very shallow and speckled with fishing boats. Although it is not the fault of the hotel property the hurricane years ago really played havok with the shore line so just be prepared that this is the case. The pool at El Taj is beatiful but not alot of pool chairs. Although I cannot speak for the other units at El Taj I would like to mention that unit 320 is private and completely quiet during the day however it is in the back of the hotel and closest to the street so at night from about 11PM until 6AM (yes I said 6 AM), if you are a light sleeper you can hear the boom boom of the nearby clubs from the master suite and master bath. Our friends in the 2nd bedroom said they did not hear anything at all. It is very faint and if you are not a light sleeper I could truly say it may not bother you at all. Albeit I did another review of Playa Del Carmen that gives more detail on Playa itself (as it was our 3rd trip back) I did want to mention that the area has changed drastically since our visit 10 years ago. Strolling 5th avenue which is where all the restaurants, shops and nightlife abound has transitioned from peaceful live music to a techno and club scene. Most restaurants have open air dining and 5th ave is still the place to be however it has definitely become a bit more crowded and louder as I mentioned. The clubs I mentioned earlier in my review are not far from El Taj, they are open air clubs and ridiculousy loud. Yes, I am 50 but I also sing in a band and loud music does not bother me. One other thing I will mention for my Gluten Intolerant folks out there (or anyone who likes organic choices) there is a small deli by the beach club at El Taj that serves all organic freshly made foods including Gluten Free pastas, bread mix etc. They made us up some home made tomato sauce and grated cheese for dinner in the unit one evening. If you are someone who does not have to have the rock free sandy beaches that go on for miles and are OK with the techo nighlife that Cancun offers than El Taj will add that extra flavor to your stay. If you cherish the ocean swimming experience and quiet \" bother free\" sunning and cannot do without this on your vacation than this property may not be for you.", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norwalk, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cVacation of a lifetime\u201d", "Author": "Beth A", "ReviewID": "UR123838402", "Content": "El Taj brings 5 star service to a whole new level.

This was our first trip to Mexico, and we LOVED it. The weather was picture perfect, the food fabulous (since we ate all up and down 5th Ave), and our 2 BR condo at El Taj was spotless, spacious, and even luxurious. The photos on this site are very accurate when it comes to the condo. The pools were very nice, both the oceanfront one and the beachside one (which is just across a narrow little street, really an alley). Our kids loved both. I know this is a review of the hotel, but what probably stands out the most from our trip, at least in my mind, were our snorkeling excursions to Tulum, Akumal, and Yal Kul lagoon (use Edventure Tours--awesome--and definitely pay for their photo services), and swimming with the dolphins at the Dolphinarium. But it was always wonderful to return \"home\" to El Taj. Pros: *It was so much fun to just walk to Fifth Avenue, just around the corner -- so many awesome restaurants, cute gift shops, and great mariachi bands wondering about, ready to play for your pleasure. No cars on the Avenue, just pedestrians. *The cute little beachfront restaurant (our stay included breakfast there) was very good. They have beach service, so I had a steady supply of margaritas any time I wanted. We ordered lunch on the beach on some days, and everyone enjoyed the food. *The units, as mentioned above, are clean and comfortable and very nicely appointed. Get one with a jacuzzi if you can. Cons: *The oceanfront condos are built in the shape of a U. Our unit was towards the back of the building, near the beachside units, near Fifth Avenue. And since Fifth Avenue is literally around the corner, the music from the nightclubs blasted all night long, right into our sleep. We had to wear ear plugs every night. With ear plugs, we were fine and got plenty of rest, but being awakened at 12am the first night was not fun. If you want to stay here, I think it's worth paying the extra to get an oceanfront unit, right in front of the beach, far from the music. *The beds are very hard. Apparently this is true of most beds in Mexican hotels. I'm determined to find a hotel in Tulum for our next trip that has more comfortable beds! *This is probably my second biggest gripe -- I like to sleep in on my vacations and did NOT want to have to wake early to stake out beachfront umbrella and chairs. I SPECIFICALLY emailed El Taj to make sure this was NOT allowed here, since it is accepted practice at almost all Caribbean resorts, and I was assured that this was not permissible at El Taj. Unfortunately, money talks louder than such policies. Not only did I see with my own eyes beach employees put \"reserved\" signs on the best beachfront chairs for guests who had slipped them money, but one guest complained loudly to me that an employee had actually tried to kick her out of a prime chair, which she nabbed early in the morning, claiming that it was 'reserved.' I also saw another guest, right in front of others, call over an employee by name, slip him money, and tell him that he expected him to have better seats saved for him the next morning. This is all fine if it doesn't bother you, and I really don't care about it on a principled basis. I just want a relaxing vacation and good beach chairs up front where I can watch my kids, and I don't want to have to bribe people or get up at 6am to get them. I'd rather they just sell those seats so that they can be officially reserved, instead of underhandedly reserved. *My biggest gripe is actually not about the hotel but the beach itself. I loved Playa del Carmen -- the water is blue, and the sand is soft. But as others have noted, the water right in front of El Taj is crowded with boats. Which also means more algae and debris. If you are just a sunbather, then you will be fine. But my kids and I love to swim in the ocean. I had no desire to go swimming between fishing boats, and it made me nervous to watch my kids do so. Also, there is a big drop off right where the sand meets the water, so that you can't really see your kids if they are playing near the water. Overall, I think this is a great, fun place for hip people who don't want to be stuck at a big resort. It really is hip, and it was fun people-watching (not fellow Americans--boring--but the more flamboyant and stylish South Americans). I think it would be great for families too if the beach were better. The accommodations (minus the hard beds) were so ideal for a family--plenty of space, a full kitchen, perfect cleanliness, etc. But I won't be returning because of the beach and the beach chairs. In the end, I want a beach vacation to have an awesome beach.", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cTwo weeks of bliss in the Mayan Magic\u201d", "Author": "Rick W", "ReviewID": "UR123619413", "Content": "We recently stayed at El Taj Oceanfront #339 for two weeks, I wish it had been four.

First of all, the staff is extremely accommodating, whether you are checking in, at the beach club, or needing something from maid service. The rooms (we were in a 1 bedroom ) are nicely appointed (Bosch appliances) and very comfortable. (way too many doors in the bathroom area - it got confusing as to which door closed what). We did feel like we were in a bit of a fishbowl since anyone walking by could see us if the curtains were even open a little. The pool is not that functional since it is does not have sun on it and there is very little space to sit around it. The 'hot tub' is not hot (is actually part of the pool so same temperature) and we noticed people only went in it once. You have to go to the beach through a little gate where you are greeted by the beach club (Indigo) staff, which is nice but it would have been nicer to just a straight path from the resort to the beach. Even though you are in a 'condo' you are not allowed any food or drink at the beach unless it is purchased at the beach club, which gets pricey and annoying when you have your own groceries and alcohol. The beach is amazing with a never-ending stream of people to watch. With the full service at Indigo, you didn't even have to spread out your own towel (thanks Juan Carlos!). The location of this resort is premium and just a few steps from 5th Ave. Check out the Dirty Martini Bar just around the corner.", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bloomington, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cWonderful service!\u201d", "Author": "cbw35691", "ReviewID": "UR123418876", "Content": "We stayed in unit 311 and loved it! El Taj has two buildings: a beach front building and another building across the street (which is where our unit was). I would have preferred to be beach front, but we got our walking in going to and from the beach a few times each day. Also, the building we were in did not have an elevator and could be an issue for someone who does not get around well. There are tons of steps! The unit itself was well appointed and had everything we needed. The front desk staff did an exceptional job and spoke very good English. They were always willing to help and were very friendly. There is security present 24/7 and they too are very friendly! There are two pools. One with each building. However there is minimal seating at both pools (there is little room for seating) and neither of the pools gets good sunlight. If you love the beach and plan to spend your time there, this is a great location. If you were hoping to lay in the sun beside a pool, this wouldn't be the spot I would chose. We loved the hot tub at our building and spent a lot of time there after the sun went down. I had a 1 hour beach massage at an adjacent property for $25 that was ok. They used drug store quality products and it was very sandy--I felt like I was getting an exfoliating treatment. I later had a 1 hour beach massage through El Taj and it was WONDERFUL! They did an excellent job and used high quality aroma therapy products and were well trained! The El Taj massage was $35 and well worth the extra $10! This location is VERY close to the night life in Playa, which is great if your plans involve staying out until the sun comes up! If not, you'll hear everything happening at the clubs from your room (including very loud music). Keeping your windows closed does help keep the sound out, but you can still hear it. It took us a few nights to get used to that, but once we did it wasn't a bother. We loved this property and would definitely stay there again if we could afford to. It is quite a bit more expensive than other hotels we have stayed at in Mexico, but at the same time quite a bit more luxurious. The service was outstanding and the unit was beautiful!

Downtown Playa is 2 short blocks away and the Mega Mart grocery store is only a 15 min walk. Also about a 10 min walk along the beach to the ferry to Cozumel. One heads up, if you use any of the complimentary Beach Club amenities then you must purchase beverages and food from the bar/restaurant. Which is not a huge deal, beer is only $3.50 a bottle and the food is great, just don't do what we did and buy a bunch of beer from the grocery store thinking you could drink it on the beach.

Our Son who is 15 & daughter 17 have outgrown sleeping in the same bed in a double room, however they don't mind sharing a room as long as they have their own beds. Our decision was to either get a suite or 2 hotel rooms at a large resort outside of town, or rent a condo in town. After comparing costs and location, we opted for El Taj because it seemed very reasonably priced for what you get and it is right in town within walking distance of the ferry and everything else. Upon our arrival, we realized that our unit (# 314) was in the beachside building, which means it is across the street from the beach. This isn't ideal, but it didn't really bother us because we were not in the room that much. The staff was very pleasant and check-in was quick and easy. When we arrived, the air in the master bedroom was not working, nor was the ceiling fan. They fixed the air within 10 minutes and replaced the fan within two days. The hot water heater temp was also set too low for the 4 of us (one shower every 30 minutes). They adjusted this for us on day 2. The staff was quick to react to any problems we had and we were given free wifi for our troubles. The staff worked very hard to make sure we were happy. We absolutely loved the close proximity of El Taj to Fifth avenue. There are many shops, restaurants, and bars along Fifth, and Starbucks is only about 4 blocks away. We also ran every morning along fifth. Our two favorite restaurants however were not on Fifth, they were across the street from the Mega food store. El Fogon was so awesome! We ate there twice. La Cieba (around the corner from El Fogon) is also a great place to eat breakfast. They have the best Chilaquiles I have ever had. We took a dive trip in Cozumel through Phantom Divers which is just a block from the hotel. Our dive masters were first rate (the 4 of us were assigned to one dive master). The diving in Cozumel was superb. El Taj guests receive a 10% discount at Phantom, so we did a 2 tank dive in Cozumel for $72 each. The ferry ride is about 45 minutes each way and about $100 round trip for 4 people. There are also dive and snorkel trips in Playa that leave directly from the beach in front of the hotel. Bear in mind...Although it may look like it (it is a beautiful facility) this is NOT a luxury resort run by a national hotel chain like the Four Seasons, Fairmont or Hilton. We are spoiled and are used to the service and hospitality given at fine non-inclusive, high end resorts. The amenities and service provided by the major hotel chains were missed. Not that these things were missing completely at El Taj, It is just a very different experience than what you get when the hotel staff is trained the same way across the globe. CONS: El Taj sits on a narrow strip of land that is very deep, which means that the square footage on the beach is very small, the beach density is a problem. The Beach Club is very much like something you would see in South Beach, a little like Nikki Beach, and it is not only open to El Taj guests. El Taj has a reciprocal membership with \"The Gym\" nearby, meaning El Taj guests can use \"The Gym\" and locals with gym memberships can use The Beach Club. Get a chair early if you want it, and don't leave your seat unoccupied for longer than an hour or so, or you will lose it. There are no drinks or snacks allowed on the beach unless bought through the restaurant. Breakfast lasts until 11:30 or 12:00 and they do not serve lunch until 12:30. At 11:30 while longing in my beach chair, I decided to pull out an apple to tide me over until I could order sushi at 12:30. That is not allowed! There is no place to swim in front of EL Taj because the dive, snorkel & fishing boats are all anchored onshore. The only place to swim is in the El Taj pool. Although the sheets were very comfortable and the mattresses very comfortable as well, BEWARE...the 2 largest night clubs in town, Coco Maya and The Blue Parrot are only one block away from El Taj. The music is VERY, VERY loud and rages on until 6:00 am every morning. The hotel should really hand out earplugs when people check in. Luckily, I had a whole bag of earplugs with me because my husband snores. I passed them out to everyone in the family. After the first night, the loud music was no longer an issue. I have tried many different brands of earplugs and the best ones are \"Macks ultra safe sound foam earplugs\". The drugstores don't carry them where we are, so I get them at Publix. I don't know how you deal with the loud music issue with young children. I don't see how you would be able to get a young child to wear earplugs? If you put them to bed by 7:00 or so before the music starts, maybe they would just sleep through it? Mine used to sleep through just about everything, including fire alarms. To summarize...Our stay was very pleasant. As long as everyone either stays out until 6:00 a.m. dancing, or wears earplugs, yours will be too!", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Corte Madera, California", "Title": "\u201cCan't wait to return to this fabulous place!\u201d", "Author": "Skye S", "ReviewID": "UR122290333", "Content": "We visited Playa del Carmen and stayed at El Taj from November 30 to Dec 4 and it was such a great experience we can't wait to return!

Our favorite restaurant by far, was Da GiGi (the best italian and just walking distance from El Taj) we ate there once and they delivered a very hot meal to our condo too. Yes, the beach has fishing boats in front of El Taj, which in my opinion added to the ambience. But the boats are also spread out enough and no one I knew had any issues with swimming between them out in the ocean to the sand bars. This was a fishing town far longer than a resort town. I am a beach person!!! The lounges and beach beds were great and the sand was white, clean and soft. It seems like some people have to complain about something...even though this condo/hotel is literally perfect! I've been coming to Mexico since the 1970's and to Riviera Maya since the late 1990's and I've only stayed at the best All-inclusives and hotels. Not staying at an All-inclusive this trip and staying at El Taj and seeing what really good food, drinks and service at really fair prices could be...was far better than any All-inlcusive and most of the top hotels in this region. Yes, you should tip the staff here...but the great service makes it well deserved. The design of El Taj, with their imported architectural elements, tropical plants, furniture and art design from Bali sets this property apart from anything in Playa Del Carmen and my hats off to the developer, Jack Perlman, for doing such an amazing job and for literally not missing a beat! We will be back with more friends and family, and we have nothing but the highest regard for the entire staff. Thank you El Taj for making our vacation a solid 5 star and I look forward to coming back again!", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ramsey, nj", "Title": "\u201cEl Taj - 336 - can't wait for next year\u201d", "Author": "ctm_nj", "ReviewID": "UR122144442", "Content": "Well, I waited on writing this review for a few weeks until the glow from the vacation had worn off and I could be a bit more objective about the hotel. But even now, about the only thing I would really change is to stay there longer. In short, we had an absolutely wonderful time. First off, we did our research \u2013 in addition to all the reviews here (thank you TA\u2019ers) , we looked at other sites and really made sure that we were getting what we wanted. We had not been to PDC before, and wanted everything to go well. So first we looked everywhere, and when we settled on El Taj we booked through the company so that we knew what we were getting. We wanted the view, and that\u2019s what made sure we were getting. (To respond to a previous reviewer, you got mislead by your travel company, not by the hotel. And to clarify about the \u201cwalk across the street\u201d for those who have not been there, the street is a cobblestone street with barely room to fit two cars, with a traffic flow of maybe 15 cars an hour, and those traveling about 10mph. In addition there are doormen stationed on both sides. There is no safety issue. The entire trek to the beach is one small city block.) The hotel is conveniently located in the heart of PDC on the beach \u2013 a short couple of blocks we were on 5th Ave with all its choices for food and shopping. We booked unit 336, on the top level on the beach (as you are looking from the pool to the beach, it is the right hand wing). Yea, it\u2019ll do. 3 bedroom, 3 bath, new construction, all the conveniences \u2013 full kitchen, plenty of cookware and utensils. Big bottled water cooler. The deck upstairs was also nicely done up \u2013 the built in sofa under a palapa, the lounge chairs, the Jacuzzi. Along of this was a nicely equipped outdoor kitchen with grill, sink, fridge, etc. The roof deck had reasonably good privacy and an AWESOME unobstructed view. Back to the main floor \u2013 everything is built very well, with a lot of attention paid to the finishing touches. It is tastefully decorated and maintained well. The master bedroom has an unobstructed view of the ocean, and is a good sized room with en-suite bathroom. All the rooms had TV and cable, and there were Homedock radios in the rooms. The other two bedrooms were done similarly, though the views were not as nice, but both with en-suite bathrooms and TVs and individual thermostats. (The third bedroom shares its bathroom with an entry from the hallway). All in all, the living areas had no real shortcomings \u2013 even the balcony had plenty of seating, whether for cocktails or breakfast in the morning. All, once again, with an unobstructed view of the beach and ocean. The service could not have been more friendly or helpful. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel welcome. We checked in with Miriam and Ricardo and were given a detailed tour of the suite, in a friendly and informative way by Salvador. Almost every time we passed an employee of the hotel we were greeted with a smile and friendly \u201cHola\u201d. The ladies who cleaned the suite \u2013 I remember Carmen - were always friendly, discreet and efficient. One nice aspect was the little wheel of choices on the door \u2013 we could opt from the simple just swap out the towels and make the bed to a full clean \u2013 and they would even do the windows! We availed ourselves of the spa services (Rosario and Beatriz), concierge (Teresa and William) for tours, Indigo for Dinner one night, and the beach club during the day. All were well run, the people were friendly and we thoroughly enjoyed it all. As for the perennial complaints of boats on the beach and noise from the clubs \u2013 the boats were there, but honestly I think they add to the charm. And for anyone to complain that they have to walk down the beach 100 yards to get into the water seems silly to us. The noise I can see being an issue for some, in honesty. We did hear the clubs some nights \u2013 our room was up high enough and along the outside wall so that the sound could reach it unobstructed. But between the central air fan, and my phone\u2019s white noise app it didn\u2019t bother us. But for those who are more sensitive, maybe a lower floor or the other wing would provide a little more shelter from the club music. We had a wonderful time in PDC in general, and a lot of that has to do with El Taj specifically.

The grounds are beautiful and serene. The eastern accents give the feeling of being in the East. The apartments are modern and well appointed with all of the amenities you would expect from an upscale condominium. Certainly, if you are traveling with a large or extended family, this property provides you with an affordable means to stay in beautiful Playa del Carmen. Lord knows the resorts make it very difficult for families larger than four people. Now for the cons. Perhaps we have become spoiled, but for most of our visits to Playa, we have stayed at all-inclusive resorts. If you too have become accustomed to the resorts, you will likely be disappointed. The level service provided by the staff will not compare. You get the feeling that simple requests are an annoyance to the staff. Be prepared that the associated beach club has rules... Lot's of rules. Don't arrive too early. If you arrive before 8am, you will not get towels or chairs, even if the guy who gives them out at 8am is standing right there. Don't change your towels too frequently \"Amigo\" (apparently twice in one day was too much for them to handle). Don't leave your chairs for too long either, like when your breakfast unexpectedly takes too long. I don't generally like to be chastised on my vacations, but I guess that's what happens to you when you break the rules :). All of this rule enforcement just happened to be during a slow week when there was clearly no run on chairs or towels. I'm generally a fairly generous tipper, but I slowed them down mid-week. The biggest con however is the noise from the Disco's down the street. For three nights, until the wee hours of the morning we were subjected to thumping music that couldn't be drown out with the AC, the ceiling fan and a white-noise generator all going simultaneously. When I went to the office to complain (which isn't staffed after 11pm) I was told that I would have to wait until the next day when the supervisor is in, but was pretty much advised that there was nothing that could be done for us. All being said, read the reviews on this site carefully. Many people have had a very positive experience with this property, but there is enough discontent smattered through that you should at least be cautious and informed about your decision to stay here. If your are going to stay at El Taj, make sure that you get to select your specific room. Stay in the oceanfront building and on the north side to ensure that you are not exposed to the noise from the Disco.

We quickly realized our mistake, as there is a big difference between staying in the oceanfront and beachside buildings. We had a 2 bedroom condo in the Beachside building, which means a walk across a street with 3 kids and all their beach floats and toys. We could have dealt with that, disappointed though we were, but the NOISE is outrageous. Do not take a unit in the Beachside building unless you are prepared to be up all night with the sounds of club music in your bedroom. We have stayed in several places in Playa, both all inclusive and smaller boutique--this is by far our worst experience. During the middle of our trip, my young daughter got sick and couldn't make it to the bathroom, so we had to clean up the floor with used bath towels. We gathered them up and called the front desk to explain what happened and what did the person at the front desk say--that if the towels were stained we would have to pay for them! Not a word asking if our daughter was okay, just this notification about stained towels. We washed them ourselves. Meanwhile, we later tried to go out to eat and the people at the restaurant were more caring and concerned over our daughter than the person at the El Taj front desk. The hotel is lovely and kept clean and service people are generally lovely. But the beach situation is an issue. We've stayed at the Gran Porto Real and have, at times, had to walk to other areas to swim. But because the El Taj beach area is so small and we have kids, we couldn't ever have beach chairs nearby so the kids could swim. And with the pool behind the beach area and no view of the ocean, there isn't much for parents to enjoy while kids swim in the pool. The music beachfront is loud all day long (whatever happened to the joy in listening to the sound of waves?)--we actually went down the beach with our towels to a quiet place where the kids could swim and we didn't have to listen to booming music...but if one has to get away from the hotel area to enjoy the beach, what's the point of staying at that hotel? As a parent who comes to Playa at least once a year, I'd say your money is better spent elsewhere.

Again, it did not disappoint. We stayed in unit #348 which was a 2 bedroom unit on the second floor on the north side of the U. This side is away from the clubs, and we never had any problems with noise. The unit is immaculate, as they all seem to be. Check-in and -out were very quick and easy, just as they were the first time. Everyone was super nice, especially Ricardo who checked us in and helped us deal with a couple of problems (not related to El Taj). The wall of sand is back and about 5 feet or so high. There are steps dug out in the wall every few meters, so you can easily get down to the water. The wall extends from just south of GPR (the all-inclusive to the north of El Taj) down to just north of the peer (the south peer), probably right around where BBBC is. So yes, it is also in front of El Faro if you are thinking about booking there. Supposedly the wall is a temporary thing and is slowly being leveled out by sand being brought back in by the change in current. At least that is what I was told. When we went in May earlier this year, there was no wall, so I assume it will level out between now and then. We used Indigo just about every day. Service and drink was always excellent. Be sure to try a Black Perl (a shot glass of Jagermeister suspended upside down in a glass of Red Bull). I had never had one before, but I saw another group of people having one and they looked so cool I had to try one. Anyway, the staff at Indigo work hard and we made sure to tip them well. El Taj does recommend a few restaurants and gives you a privilege card that offers 10% or more discount. We tried 2 of the recommended restauraints, Da Gi Gi and Casa Del Agua. Both were excellent. Da Gi Gi is on 5th ave but up around 34th, not 26th as advertised in El Taj's brochure. Also worth a mention is Alux - if you haven't been there, be sure to check it out. Even if you have a rental, grab a cab, it'll only be 2 or 3 $US to get there. The place was very cool, with little romatic alcoves that you could wander off into, sit down, be alone, and have a quiet drink. We originally just went for drinks, but enjoyed the ambience so much that we ate there too. The food was very good.

The weather was great, and although it was the spring break timeframe, the place was not overcrowded. In fact we had the small pool outside our \"beachside\" condo to ourselves most of the time. All the other earlier reviews on this place were exactly accurate as to the benefits and downsides of the two different buildings of this resort. We stayed in Apt 307 in the \"Beachside\" building, which is definitely not on the beach, but is just a quick walk away through the other \"Oceanfront\" building. We did not find that problematic in the least, but if you are hoping to see the ocean from your apartment or walk right from your apartment onto the beach, you do not want to be in the Beachside building. None of the upper level apartments in the Oceanfront building were available when we rented, so we rented instead Apt 307 in the Beachside building, and it was exactly what we expected - stylish, clean, two nice size bedrooms, very comfortable beds in each, two well appointed bathrooms, and a very useful kitchen and living area, as well a nice outdoor space overlooking the small pool for that building. We did have a problem with the air conditioning in the master bedroom for much of the stay, and I'm not sure they really fixed it by the time we left, but the other airconditioning units worked very well. Although the Beachside building pool is right next to the street, it is surrounded by jungle plantings, so you feel as if you are much more private setting than it actually is. This is not one of those oceanside full-service resorts with large beachfront property of its own. The beach outside the Oceanside building is actually just part of the long public beach that runs along an assortment of restaurants, bars and hotels in Playa del Carmen (although the El Taj does have a very small area with its own chiase lounges and a small beach restaurant). The one downside to the beach at El Taj is that the swimming area is essentially non-existent because the many fishing/tourist boats anchor right at the beach, taking up almost all the swimming area. We walked about 3 minutes down the beach to swim, which was not a big deal for us, but if you have young children and are looking for a beach area outside your resort where your kids could run in and out of the water easily while you watch them from you lounge chair - this is not the set-up for you. This is a small complex in downtown Playa del Carmen, very convenient to all the restaurants and shops. If you are looking for total beach seclusion, this isn't the place for you. But if you want to be centrally located, near the beach and have a modern, comfortable apartment with kitchen rather than a small hotel room, this place is perfect.

The hotel is located right on the beach and had great views. We got a 3 bedroom, 2 bath penthouse (room 350). At check-in, everything was handled quickly, and we even got the all you can use internet and phone calls (international included VoP) for an additional $35. The rooms were spacious - but not as large as we'd imaged from the pictures - but definitely enough for all of us. After settling in, we went straight to the beach to check it out. In order to get a beach towel, each person had to hand in a \"towel card\" which you need to exchange for it back later. If this card is lost, there is a $25 per card fee. The beaches were nice, but had a stinch of seaweek smell. We had to walk down to right side of the beach to get to a better spot for swimming/snorkeling - not much of snorkeling since we weren't able to see anything really. We had a private chef come and cook for us one evening and they did a great job. Sangria was awesome, and they cleaned up everything as well. The location of El Taj is great, right by 5th avenue. Lots of shops, and restaurants and within a 10 min walk to the ferry to Cozumel or the bus station. We actually took the ADO bus to Tulum and XPlor which I felt saved us a bunch of money instead of going with a tour group. The bus was 58 pesos each way to Tulum and the admissions was 51 pesos (adds up to 167 pesos for Tulum which converted is around $13 USD). The buses were clean and comfortable - they even played movies, but in Spanish. For 2 nights, we went to Mega and bought food and cooked ourselves on the terrace. Loved the terrace, we cooked and just relaxed up there afterwards. Overall, the El Taj was great especially with it's condo style living.

We called the reception and Hector resolved this issue immediately. Overall our holiday was very enjoyable as we visited the surrounding areas. Our biggest issue was with the beach club which I really think lets the hotel down. I know they are under different management but being associated with the club did taint our opinion of El Taj. The waiters are by no means the friendliest and the so called room service offered by the club is non exsistent unless you order before 5pm, after that all that is on offer is pizza or sushi, Management need to look at the menus available in the rooms and update them when necessary. The beach was not the paradise that I was expecting, maybe my expectations were too high??? the beach is fine if you just want to lounge and sip cocktails all day. And as for luxurious lounging, the beds are worn and ripped in places, the umbrellas are black with mold from being left closed when damp. Really all it needs is a bit of updating but not 5 star of even 4 star!! The water is not the most inviting and the smell from the boat engines can be over powering at times.

I enjoyed beginning my mornings with a cup of coffee and my iPad, sitting on the balcony keeping in touch with everyone at home and reading up on the daily news. It truly felt like home and I really loved the privacy of El Taj Oceanfront #345! The interior besides being beautifully decoratred is fully equipped with a washer/dryer, full kitchen, TV\u2019s, DVD player and filtered water cooler. The rooftop has a private Jacuzzi, lounge chairs, a sofa, refrigerator and a BBQ. We loved that we could make our own meals, enjoy the breath taking view of the ocean during the day or gaze at the stars in the evening and fully relax in our own private space. If we had too much sun and wanted some shade while on the roof top terrace we just sat beneath our own private palapa. Such privacy in our own personal outdoor space was a big improvement compared to our previous vacations. The property has a beautiful pool as well as access to another pool at their sister resort across the street. There was always plenty of lounge chairs available around the pool as well as at the beach and they provided pool toys such as beach balls and inflatable chairs. The staff was very helpful, friendly and approachable. They would walk us down to the beach or pool area, lay out a towel and put up or open an umbrella and even offer to clean our sunglasses! One evening we were going on a tour early in the morning and needed dry, clean towels. The towel station had already been put away for the night when I requested new towels and told them of our plans. Without hesitation they got us fresh towels right out of the dryer! I love to walk alone on the beach in the early morning and evening and I always felt very safe on and around the property. The beach was beautiful and well kept. Every morning while enjoying my coffee I watched them sweep up seaweed that washed onshore. There are a few fishing boats tied down along the water\u2019s edge, which did not bother us or detract from the view. The location was perfect for shopping or walking down 5th avenue for dinner or entertainment in the evening.

We've stayed at Beach side and Ocean front condos. Ocean front is nice because you are truly ocean front, but the Beach side condos are equally as nice; just have to walk 15 more steps to cross the street into the Ocean front units to get to the ocean. I believe both sides have the same unit designs... they are very similar and are appointed with the same design features. We usually choose a 2 bed/2 bath even if we are only heading down there as a couple. The extra room makes us more comfortable, but the one bedrooms are just fine for a couple. The ocean front pool is spectacular and the beach club that is just in front of that pool is wonderful. The food at this beach club is spectacular. We eat our breakfast there very morning, and really find little reason to go anywhere else for lunch. True this: The food here is spectacular. we choose to wander around more at night for other food options, but I really have to say the chef and mgmt at the beach club restaurant are top notch. We love hanging all day at the beach club on their beds and lounge chairs and getting the excellent service from their staff all day. The beach just in front of El Taj is white sand and beautiful, but the local \"panga\" fishing boats are lined up on the beach there, so you must walk 100 yards south to get a clear shot of a boat-less swimming area. The boats are beautiful though to look at... just not to swim amongst. If you stay here at El Taj, you are the type of person that wants to be close to the action. El Taj is close to the best restaurants and clubs in Playa but it is peaceful there. We've stayed in several units there and never have a problem sleeping. You can hear some of the pumping clubs a few streets away on Fridays and Saturdays if you are outside on your patios, and the clubs are open late, but I've never heard anything inside the units, so sleep isn't a problem. We like being so close to the action, but not staying on 5th avenue... the small street El Taj is on is very quiet, but 2-3 blocks from the best clubs in town. For a small fee, ($25 I think) we got unlimited telephone calls and unlimited web availability for the stays we were there for the last 2 times. The kitchen is extremely well appointed with all the appliances and pots and pans you need to cook at home. If you stay in one of the 2/2s with a roof top deck, please know that you must spend time up there in the hot tub and grill.

We thought we should take many pictures of the hotel thinking it might get destroyed in the hurricane and we wanted a lasting memory of it since this is one of the most beautiful hotels. We have traveled all over the world and stayed in some of the most luxurious hotels and El Taj has one of the most unique atmosphere especially since the architecture of the building is so unique. The building is all curves and there is hardly straight wall. The pictures on their web site are very nice but the pictures do not capture the real beauty of the building. It's magnificent! The landscaping is so lush and tropical. We thought it would be a shame if the buildings got damaged and It suddenly dawned on us that we are staying in the building. Everyone at the front desk and most of the staff speaks english and this was very comforting (especially during a crisis) since we don't speak Spanish which is their native language. Normally it wouldn't make a difference, but in situations like this we were getting a little nervous and we heard the hurricane formulated into a category 3 and destruction was almost certain. We were determined to enjoy our vacation and we are having one of the best vacations ever. Actually I am writing this review while we are still in Playa. We read a few reviews that there are several boats anchored in front of the beach club. When we first arrived there were a few boats and we thought it added to the charm of the place. Especially since the boats were local fishing boats and painted in bright colors and reminded us of a little greek fishing village. You can walk about 100 feet to the right and the crystal clear turquoise water is magnificent for swimming. We couldn't believe that we read a few negative reviews about the boats when you can swim just a few feet away. There is also a very cute picturesque pier in front of El Taj. We understand the owners of El Taj built the pier for wedding ceremonies but the pier is quite popular just to hang out and you can capture great sunsets which we saw on the first day we arrived. The beach club is awesome and they offer a great buffet breakfast every morning. It seems they offer a promotion frequently that provides complimentary breakfast since most people had breakfast vouchers but it's a great deal for $145 pesos around $13 US dollars. We became friendly with a few guests and one person complained because they booked their vacation through a big travel discount.com and they didn't know which condo they would receive until they arrived and they seemed to be a bit disappointed. We booked directly through the hotel and choose the room we wanted. All the front units facing the beach are 3 bedroom units and there is only one two bedroom unit directly on the beach. El Taj has two swimming pools. It is actually two separate properties called Beachside and Oceanfront. The oceanfront property is directly on the beach facing the ocean and beachside property is across the street from the oceanfront property. The unit we stayed in was spectacular and it looked brand new. We are light sleepers and the mattress was heavenly. Their was hardly any noise and it was very quiet even though the clubs are down the block from El Taj. The rooms are very spacious and they have I-pod players and cable TV and all the amenities you expect of a well appointed home. The windows are double insulated glass that block almost any outside noise. They claim the windows are hurricane proof glass but we didn't want to witness if this was true even though we would have liked to hear the crashing of the waves which were quite big but no chance of that with the thick glass windows. The location of El Taj is awesome if you want to be in the middle of everything. The famous 5th Ave. is only two blocks away. There's no need for a car or taxi since everything is within walking distance. We celebrated our 25th anniversary with our two grown children and they went out to the local clubs and bars that are just down the block. No worries for us especially since walking back from the clubs is just one or two blocks away! The only concerns we had was the Hurricane. The next day the manager offered to move us to their other property at Maya Villa or Porto Playa since our room was directly on the beach. They also offered the same for other guests and I must say we felt extremely safe in our unit in El Taj. But we never experienced a hurricane before. Most of the guests stayed in El Taj to ride out the hurricane but we choose to move to Maya Villa. It is only one block from El Taj but not on the beach. We also looked at this property on trip advisor before booking El Taj and we were not quite sure if we should stay in Maya Villa since we like staying in beachfront properties especially with an ocean view. So when they offered to move us we thought it would be great to experience both of their properties. We were sad to leave El Taj and thought we would return after the hurricane. But once we walked over to Maya Villa we were equally blown away and couldn't believe how quint this hotel was. It captures a Mayan theme with exquisite detailing and I couldn't stop admiring the gecko shaped swimming pool. It is a much smaller pool than El Taj but it is very unique sort of like a river pool with spectacular jade colored mosaic tiling throughout. They provided us with a 3 bedroom duplex condo that is stunning. I will post a Maya Villa review but the best news is that Hurricane Rina had been downgraded to a major tropical storm. We do not recommend traveling to this region in October since it is the tail end of Hurricane season. But if your not worried about the weather then El Taj or Maya Villa is the best place in all of Playa. Their Fitness club is also fabulous and it is a professional gym not your typical hotel gym. We also got to know the concierge (Teresa). She is so helpful and she is eager to help with anything. She also knows every restaurant and she offers a library full of complimentary DVD's and games which we found very handy since we are in a tropical storm and currently writing this review. Since we are riding out the storm in our condo I will also write a review for Maya Vila condo hotel. I hope you find this review helpful. We definitely recommend El taj or Maya Villa and we are coming back in January!", "Date": "October 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago", "Title": "\u201cSpectacular!\u201d", "Author": "ankica", "ReviewID": "UR119828631", "Content": "El Taj a stunning gem!

The interior of the unit was designed nicer than any of the resorts we stayed at and comes with everything needed for a comfortable stay, including washer/dryer, full kitchen, 2 bathrooms and 4 TVs.

Maybe it\u2019s because our unit was the furthest from the bars, but the only time we\u2019d hear them was when we were on the balcony at night; once inside the condo and the door shut, we couldn\u2019t hear a thing. The staff there was all very friendly and outgoing; they really went out of their way to make us feel comfortable and welcomed. Every morning we went to the beach, they would walk with us to the loungers and would lay towels on them for us and set up the umbrellas when needed. Anytime we needed anything, they were on it within minutes. The beach was well kept and clean. Every morning they would come out and sweep up any seaweed that washed onshore. There were some boats tied down along the water\u2019s edge, but that didn\u2019t really bother us. We thought it was quaint, and when we went into the water, we\u2019d just walk down the dock that took us out past the boats but was still relatively shallow.

It is literally two steps from the entrance to the jacuzzi and a few more steps down a short staircase to the pool. You can see the water from the open patio out front as well. The resort staff was wonderful. The bellmen we dealt with and the people at the front office and concierge all spoke great english which helped us tremendously since our spanish was quite limited. Everyone was friendly, welcoming, and always diligently working to keep the entire resort as clean and well-maintained as could be. Additionally, the owner was great to deal with. If we were staying at El Taj again, I'd hope to deal with the owner again because he was so thorough and easy to contact. We had a small issue with a miscommunication upon arrival and with a quick email to the owner he had it straightened out in a matter of minutes. He also was really helpful in emails prior to our trip providing us with some local tips and tricks for getting to and from the airport and eating as well! It was a real pleasure. We hope to stay there again! If you're looking for an easy going stay at a place that isn't too big like all the cookie cutter resorts, give El Taj, and specifically Unit 327, a look.

Our condo was gorgeous (unit 318 - which btw is the 2nd floor b/c the 100 level rooms are at ground level...a little confusing and deceiving). Anyway, the unit is very well thought out with everything you could ever want. Dishwasher, microwave, full stove, barware, blender, cookware, full fridge, breakfast bar, full table, family room, very nice and large bedrooms. Great bathrooms with vessel bowl sinks and lovely granite. Private hot tub outside our front door that we used every single day we were there. The pool is awesome and we probably spent 3 hours one day sitting in the upper pool whirlpool seats reading our books (see photos). The beach club is amazing. Never ever have I sat on more comfortable, plush beds on the sand. The attendants follow you to your seat and will set up umbrellas to give you the perfect amount of shade or sun and then will come around and move them for you later in the day when the sun moves! Food can be delivered to you on the beach and they bring out these little wicker mini tables that sit right on your beach bed so you can eat comfortabley. Drinks were reasonable for a hotel at about $7-$8 for a margarita. Food is very good, especially the pizzas! We went out to the near by Mega to stock up on food while our room was getting ready. We purchased water and ice only to learn that each unit has filtered water coolers and you can call the front desk at any point and they will bring you as many bags of free ice that you may need. The one and only negative was the very very loud music being played until 5am at the night club next door. We are from Chicago and deal with loud city noises all the time, but this was crazy. EVen with ear plugs in, the only time I'd fall asleep was when the air con kicked in. Then I'd wake up again when it kicked off.

We walked around the streets and along the beach at night without incident.

First, the property is centrally located in town and beachfront. Great for young couples and singles as it is only 100 yards or so to fun clubs/bars. You can walk anywhere in town. The resort is split into two parts, the lobby and beachside condos are apart from the backside condos split by a small cobblestone street. Both areas have their own pools. The rear condos still have water views on the upper floors and is actually preferred due to its more private, quiet location. Several small children awoke early we found and played loudly in the front pool. The condo itself was flawless. We stayed in a two bedroom, 304 I believe with granite counter tops, stainless steel appliances, and private balconies overlooking the pool and gardens. Everything was clean and even had a water cooler with purified water. The only downside we found was the beach. While it is an expansive, white sand beach, the water is somewhat disappointing as local fishing and scuba boats line the water the entire length. You must enter between the boats and wade past them to enjoy the water. Their presence kind of takes away from the beauty of the beach/water. Also, there was no wine opener in the condo. We called the front desk and they brought up a broken opener. We tried to go to the restaurant/bar but it was closed on a Monday night. Ended up walking down to a bar to have them open our bottle. Other than that no complaints to speak of. Great service on the beach (Carlos) and great food at the restaurant. Playa del Carmen is a great town that everyone will enjoy.

I booked on hotels.com at a discount and received a fabulous one bedroom king condo. It was beautifully appointed with a huge full kitchen, living room, bathroom, washer and dryer, and patio(unit 347). The place was so ultra clean. I never saw a single ant or bug once! Also, I have never experienced such a nice, dry, cool room- a/c worked VERY well, and they had ceiling fans in each room of the unit. RESTAURANT: The restaurant was awesome- we didn't go there for breakfast, as we didn't want a buffet, but we ate there for lunch twice and I ordered the Indigo pizza both times because it was so good the first time. Shrimp, pesto, zucchini, and cherry tomatoes on it. YUMMMMM!!! The beach service was excellent- the attendants lay your towels out on a chair, adjust your umbrellas for the shade you want, then the waiter comes and serves you all day. Outside alcohol is not allowed at the beach club but we hung out there all day having beers, pina coladas, and pizzas and our bill for all day(for two people) was about 80USD each day. Not bad. BEACH: The beach was super nice. Yes, there are boats there in front. Pretty much any hotel in downtown Playa del Carmen is going to have boats in front, somewhere in your view. With boats comes fishing. With fishing comes a foul smell at times. If you want to get in the water with less boats, there is about a 50 yard walk down past the majority of the boats. I just got in and swam past the boats, where the water is clear blue and still shallow. The boats are not parked close together, so it is very easy to get in and enjoy the water. The bottom of the water is nice and sandy not rocky which is nice. The vibe sitting at the beach is super relaxed and pleasant, and the staff is friendly. LOCATION: The hotel is located right in the middle of everything!!! I am not a huge party person anymore, but the hotel is about a block from all of the clubs. Even though it was really close, it was so quiet. So if you want to be at the bars sometimes, and retreat to a quiet place, it was great. Also, and of the restaurants downtown are within walking distance to the hotel. If you don't feel like walking though, the cab rides downtown were 2-3 dollars each way. It was so easy to just go back to the hotel if we needed to, and just walk around in the evenings. We ate at some really great restaurants: El Fogon, La Cueva del Cahngo, Piola, Fusion- they were all great. The recommendations we got were all fantastic! CONCIERGE AND FRONT DESK- Everyone here was great, honest, etc. I was between booking a tour and going to Akumal for the day and the concierge, Teresa, helped us rent a car and recommended Akumal, even though the tour would have cost us a lot of money and I assume she would have gotten a nice commission on it. I was really impressed with her honesty. She told us about restaurants and information in Akumal, too. Also at the concierge they have books, magazines, movies, beach toys, noodles for the water, etc. The front desk staff was always friendly and helpful. The first night we got there the girl at the front desk took us to our room, showed us how to work the remotes for the TV, the coffee maker, the ceiling fans, told us how to walk to the Mega, etc. Everyone was so friendly- top notch!!! NEW NEGATIVE REVIEWS: Really I am shocked to read the negative reviews. I have been to Mexico and stayed at several hotels in Cozumel, one in Cancun, and several in Playa del Carmen area and I have NEVER stayed at such an awesome place. The only thing I can figure is because of all of the awesome reviews the negative reviewers had some kind of greatly unrealistic expectations. The staff here would obviously bend over backwards to make people happy. They are number one and they want to keep it that way. There is an obvious overly helpful attitude here. I can only imagine that some people just can't be made happy. SUMMARY: I can't wait to book another trip here!!!

I shared Rm #32 w/ another couple (also totally impressed w/ El Taj). I stayed here Sept 2-5, 2011. I'd have to work really really hard to find anything critical to say of El Taj. The place is spectacular, the grounds are spectacular, and the staff is spectacular to boot. I arrived around 9PM into El Taj and was greeted at the entrance of the hotel, where the staff ushered us into reservations to square up on housekeeping, keys, etc. That was all of 10 minutes at which point I was given a parking pass for my stay. Parking is free, garage is clean, and you can enter grounds from the garage area itself. The first step into the place defined my whole experience: serene, easy-breezy, contemporary, relaxed, oasis. The unit itself is stellar, well appointed, comes w/ shot glasses, pints, a solid blender, cutting board, forks/knives/spoons, safes for your valuables. You'd hate to be a smidgen of dirt cause the place is super clean and you have the option of having it cleaned everyday, just got to let the cleaning people know. They arrive around 12pm daily. The pool is a winner, great temperature, great views from the pool, unique design, and just awesome. The Indigo Bar is good. I had breakfast every morning and it was fantastic, I had the buffet. I ordered a drink from the bar (Pina Colada) and if there is anything that needed any improvement, which is not easy to find at El Taj, it would be the drinks. I'd hit up Mega, right up the street, for my drinks, etc though, so getting yourself set up w/ drinks, etc is nothing more than a trip to the grocery market away. Mega is as modern and large as any large grocery market in the US, it's huge and has everything you'll need to usher in the good times. I walked along the beach as far as I possibly could before being cut off by a barrier and El Taj is bar far the most beautiful place along a 3/4 mile stretch of the beach. I researched like a dog for three weeks before pulling the trigger on El Taj and it was some of the best money I've spent in quite some time. If you are on the fences about this place, I can say w/o hesitation, you've done yourself a solid if you chosen this place.

I am not sure why they are rated number one! We travel a lot, and love the Mexican Riviera for good R and R, but El Taj and R and R should not be used together. This is our honeymoon, and we wanted the best. When we arrived, it was a nightmare! We were told that we had been UPGRADED to a two room condo- we only needed one bedroom, but we thought we would look at it, thinking it would be a better location. We nicknamed this unit the fish-bowl. It is directly above the check in desk, facing the street and the discos. So, it was very load. NO view of anything, expect the maids who congregated outside the window, and everyone who walked through the hotel, since it is the first room at the top of the stairs. We refused this room, and were told the only other room available was a one bedroom on the third floor. When we went to look at this, the room was ok- quieter, but REEKED of smoke! My husband is horribly allergic. The desk people refused to give us any other chose, since we HAD BOOKED THROUGH A TRAVEL AGENCY, not directly with them. ??????????????? We were mystified by this reasoning. We tried to call our travel agent, but could not get a line out since we were in Mexico, and the man at the desk refused to help us. We were stuck! We took the stinky room and opened all the windows and the maid lit incense. After three days, the smell went away, but my husband was horribly ill. The fish bowl would have been just as bad since it backed onto the alley and was directly above were the staff smoked on the street. Each day we asked to change, but were told they were sold out- although it looked that half the units were open each night! Service at the beach club was minimal, unless you were a cute girl that kissed the beach boys. Only once in 5 days did anyone offer to clean our glasses, or ask if we needed a drink. It was pretty much self serve at the over priced bar attached. Beds were hard as a rock!!! Pools have only a couple of chairs by each and do not entice you to lay by them.

We are big travelers and have been lots of places and El Taj ranks among one of the top. This was our first time staying at a Condo/Hotel and we loved the experience and all it had to offer. It's like being at a boutique hotel, yet you have so much space to yourself! The staff was wonderful, very helpful and accommodating. We stayed in a 1 bedroom unit on the main level (unit 347) and were very impressed with how clean, modern, and comfortable it was. We loved having an evening cocktail on our patio surrounded by the lush landscaping and right near the koi pond & fountain. It was so relaxing and just what we needed. We weren't bothered by any noise from the clubs or street as some other reviews posted, but we could sometimes hear the family above us when they would move the chairs around inside their unit. We had breakfast at Indigo Beach Club included in our stay and we have to say that it was quite good. My husband tried a different egg dish each morning - he loved the variety while I loved that Roger remembered my special order without me even having to say anything. We also had lunch there a couple of times - we recommend the pizza. The beach is the only thing that isn't totally great because of the boats anchored right out front, but nothing is perfect in life. We still loved sitting on the comfy lounge chairs & beds and having yummy drinks served to us. If we wanted to go for a swim in the sea, we just walked a short distance to either side and the water was fine. The pool at El Taj is wonderful, perfect water temp and a beautiful, elegant design. We recommend renting a car through the concierge and going to the beach at Akumal one day - you can rent snorkel gear and see the sea turtles. The beach there is also very beautiful and you can pack a color and spend the day. There are restaurants and toilets there too in case you want some creature comforts. Only about 10 mins from Akumal is Yal ku lagoon where you can go for some great snorkeling. It is also an easy walk or cab ride to either Wal-Mart or Mega. We went to both and I have to say I was super impressed with the Wal-Mart. I despise Wal-Marts in the US and avoid them at all costs so I was reluctant to go to one in Mexico. Well, let me tell you that it was so clean, organized and the people were very helpful. They had a large selection of products and you could get pretty much anything you need from alcohol to food to floats for the sea. You should also go to Era Ora for dinner at least one night.

First, I just have to echo all the previous comments about the beauty of the building, the pools, the common areas, etc. Our daughters adored the koi ponds and the very different feel of the pools at Oceanfront and Beachside. Despite the gorgeous beach view from the pool at Oceanfront, I preferred the quiet, peaceful feel - as well as the shady coolness - of the beachside pool. Neither pool was too crowded the week we were there and they were a nice break from the beach. The beach was very nice as well. I am one of those guests who enjoyed the boats being moored there on the beach. I thought they were picturesque and interesting - one day one of the boats brought in a huge snapper and the whole beach - including the employees of most of the hotels - gathered around to ogle the fish! One of my daughters caught the snorkeling bug this trip and she and my husband had a great time swimming out past the boats to snorkle - they saw a lot of fish and even an octopus trying to hide in a hole. My only complaint about the beach is just that it is a little loud and crowded for my taste, but I could have walked or taken a taxi a ways north or south and avoided the crowds and noise and it didn't bother me enough to do that. Just know that this is a people-watching, music-playing kind of beach experience rather than a peaceful, listen to the waves kind of experience. Indigo Beach Club at El Taj was wonderful. The staff was attentive and courteous - they'd even notice that the sun was moving and come move my umbrella without being asked! Being brought a drink and having the gorgeous view to stare at definitely helped to make up for the slightly crowded feel. I'd recommend getting to the beach early enough to get a chair or bed on the front row of the rows of chairs because that also helped a lot. All of our interactions with the staff - Hector and Theresa - were pleasant and our couple of requests were quickly met. Unit 320 was beautiful and very well appointed. We didn't notice noise from the clubs at night except in the master bathroom and that didn't bother us at all. It is really amazing how well insulated the rooms are when you realize just how loud the music from the nearby club is! We did notice loud singing, laughing, talking from fellow guests that lasted until 4 a.m. one night, but it was just the once and we drowned them out with a fan. We enjoyed the penthouse terrace that came with our room, but debated whether we really used it enough to make it worthwhile for us. I think it would be perfect for a large group or for someone who wanted to host other friends, etc., but it was just the four of us and we never did use the grill or the table up there other than to do a puzzle and play some games. We enjoyed the hot tub - especially at night when the view of Cozumel was breathtaking - but we might forego the terrace when we go back. We loved having the kitchen and shopping at Mega and Walmart and being able to fend for ourselves a little bit was part of the adventure for us. We loved being able to explore Playa and find our own favorite restaurants,etc. This location just can't be beat.

The reviews for this particular property are very accurate but do not fully capture the beauty of the facility. The staff were incredibly helpful, Teresa in the concierge's office was the best at booking trips for us, giving us movies to watch and providing us advice for the area. We also enjoyed a chef preparing us a meal in the condo which literally made our mouths water. We stayed in Unit 333, a 3 bedroom on the second floor overlooking the ocean which had a great view and was in incredible condition physically and ascetically. The hot tub on the veranda looking over the ocean was so relaxing and was all ours! The room was also immaculately cleaned daily and the air conditioning was a treasure-we kept the unit at 74 degrees, and it was perfect. You can play as much or as little as you like and the facilities on the beach were the best in the entire region. They have huge bed-like lounges you can relax on with umbrellas that the staff works diligently to keep positioned correctly as the sun moves, and you can order food & drinks from the beach club if you like and they will bring you the drinks and food as you relax on your lounge. It really does not get any better than this! The pool they have is wonderful, and immediately above it, spilling over a glass wall, is another pool with three custom seats with massage jets in them-it is not heated, but is incredibly relaxing. The entire experience, from the Tulum Ruins to snorkeling to chilling on the beach was fantastic and an excellent environment for our family. It is one of the nicest beaches I have been to, and provided lots of people watching as well as ocean viewing. Seeing Cozumel off in the distance was also a treat. You can walk for miles up and down the beach in both directions, and we met some very friendly people there. The short 2 block walk to 5th Avenue was also fun as there is a wide variety of shops, restaurants and services offered for a mile in each direction. It was an easy walk to the Mega market which appears to be the Playa version of Wal-Mart (which is also in Playa) where we were able to get food for the week for lunch-it was sure nice having some snacks when we wanted them. It cost a whole $5.00 to get back to the condo with our groceries-quite a bargain as that included the tip!", "Date": "August 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFantastic! Pretty Much Perfect\u201d", "Author": "axestone", "ReviewID": "UR116135389", "Content": "My wife, two teenagers, and I, had a great, three-week stay at El Taj Oceanfront and look forward to a return visit! El Taj is a very stunning and spectacularly designed condo/hotel in an extremely convenient location in Playa del Carmen, right on the beach and very close \u2013 but not too close (!) \u2013 to 5th Avenue. We spent our first 9 days in unit 320, a two-bedroom penthouse suite located at the southwest corner of the building at the \u2018back\u2019. When I say \u2018back\u2019, I don\u2019t mean this to be a negative. In fact, in my opinion this is a very positive feature as this particular unit is physically separated from any adjacent suites, i.e. no walls are shared with any neighbours and the suite is away from the action of the restaurant and beach club located at the \u2018front\u2019 of the building. Unit 320 is very well appointed and outfitted with all that one could possibly need. The kitchen has every sort of gadget and appliance anyone would ever require and the living area is very cozy with a great flat-screen tv and dvd player with a great sound system. The master bedroom is very well furnished with a great, double-sink ensuite bathroom. The other bedroom had two twin beds that our teenagers had to share before we would be moving to finish our stay in unit 325, an adjacent 3-bedroom penthouse unit. Due to relatively late booking, i.e. 3 months of so in advance of our stay, we were not able to secure the 3-bedroom unit for our entire stay. As it was, our two teenagers got along fine sharing the room\u2026 at least for most of the time! The suite has a stacking washer/dryer that was very convenient to have and was well used during our stay. The rooftop terrace is amazing with lush, tropical landscaping, a large thatched-roof shaded area, trellis, barbeque, counter, fridge, outdoor shower and hot tub Jacuzzi. We found the Jacuzzi to be a tad to warm at 105\u00b0F but very nice after we set it to 95\u00b0! The views from the rooftop terrace are amazing! Our move into the 3-bedroom penthouse unit 325 was very easy to accomplish since it is adjacent to, but separate, from unit 320. The front desk arranged a late check-out for us from 320 and an early check-in to 325, which meant that we simply had to move our belongings from one suite to another without having to pack everything up \u2013 a few quick trips and we were done! Unit 325 was very similar in design to 320, but it didn\u2019t quite have the high level of coziness and intimacy that our first unit had \u2013 this would appear to have been from the willingness of the owner of unit 320 to leave out decorative bowls, paintings, additional furnishings, etc. and to provide a slightly higher quality and quantity of electronics in their suite for the use of guests then the owner of 325 was willing to do. Having said that, 325 was still very nice \u2013 of prime importance was the additional bedroom that allowed our kids to each have their own rooms, tv\u2019s, temperature control, etc. Speaking of temperature control, both suites had air conditioning, which was very welcome, but the a/c units for 325 were considerably louder than those in 320 \u2013 but this is just quibbling as the sound level was relatively okay \u2013 it was simply quieter in 325. The roof terrace was very similar to that of our first unit, i.e. top marks all around. Some reviews mention noise from the nearby outdoor discos and we did notice the noise, but not to any level that caused us loss of sleep. Why the nearby clubs feel the need to try to out-decibel-level each other is beyond me\u2026 but then again my club-hopping days are long gone. Due to the length of our stay, we were provided with complimentary breakfast at the restaurant, complimentary beach club use, and complimentary use of the fitness centre. All of these features were top notch. The breakfast featured an extensive cold breakfast buffet with granola, yoghurt, fruit, toast, cakes, etc. and a selection of hot made-to-order entrees that included any style of eggs, bacon, and a few Mexican-style breakfast offerings. We ate at a table on the beach under palm trees and parasols every morning with an amazingly friendly and attentive staff. I can\u2019t remember all of their names but they were all great to us! The beach club staff are fantastic and would assist us each day with setting us up with beach chairs, parasols, and towels. The guys would reposition the parasols throughout the day to ensure that everyone got the level of shade protection they desired while the restaurant staff would provide beachside drink and food service \u2013 it was amazing! The restaurant serves delicious food with a particularly fantastic pizza! The white sand beach is beautiful, the water is warm and inviting, and the fresh-water pools in the condo/hotel are refreshing. The gym is very well fitted out and we understand that it is going to be expanded. I would have liked to made use of a rowing machine, but this is simply a minor point. The famed 5th Avenue is very close by and yet sufficiently removed to not be a distraction. There are a multitude of restaurants on 5th Avenue or just a few blocks further afield. We particularly enjoyed Era Ora, El Fogon and Ah Cacao. In summary, El Taj is absolutely amazing and we miss it already\u2026 and it\u2019s only been two days since we left! There is very little room left for improvement at El Taj \u2013 from what we saw and experienced during our stay, the management and staff are committed to making the place absolutely perfect!

El taj was simply fabulous!!! Location, atmosphere, decor, furnishings, amenities- Wow. We will definitely be returning. A few points to note: which Indigo Beach Club was very convenient- drinks were expensive, however, the pizza was very very good. We recommend going down the beach to Wicky's Beach Club (Monday at Wicky's is all you can drink from 12-6pm for 300 pesos, and order the Wicky Burger- awesome! I had it twice during the week). The included breakfast at Indigo was again convenient and very good for a few mornings, but I recommend talking a walk down 5th to 34th and stopping in Chez Celine for very very good French pastries and cappuccino to go- the walk in the morning is great exercise and the breakfast well worth it. Also- take a cab one morning down to 38th and have breakfast at the monkey cave- La Cueva del Chango. A+ for atmosphere and food! The pools at all the El Taj properties were really neat (oceanfront, beachside and porto playa- Maya villa was very small). We had a jacuzzi on our balcony but we never used it- it was too hot during the day and we were too tired every night. We also recommend the following restaurants: El Fogan, Carboncitos, Las Comales, La Pummerola and Ah Cacao.... Also Wet Wendy's in Cozumel for amazing and huge margaritas. Also Turtle Bay Bakery in Akumal for breakfast before snorkeling with the turtles and lunch at Lol Ha after snorkeling with the turtles. Take the Collectivos if you travel outside of Playa ($3US pp to get to Akumal). Take the ferry across to Cozumel one day to go to a beach club and snorkel. We spent one day at an AI hotel- Catalonia Royal Tulum, again we took the Collectivo to and from the resort in Xpuha for less than half the cost of a taxi round trip ($12US each way for 4 people). We have stayed at the CRT before and loved it but we wanted to do the non AI route thus time- glad we went back for one day it was a lot of fun to share the experience with our friends that we were traveling with on this trip. Shop on and off 5th, barter well and have fun.

Things we loved: - Easy access to 5th Avenue restaurants and shops - Friendly and helpful staff at El Taj and the Indigo Beach Club - Great pool at the Beachside location - Oceanside is nice too but Beachside pool is much nicer - Dining at Sur, Era Ora, Agave Azul and Wicky's Things we were not so crazy about: - The fishing boats parked all along the beach - The extremely loud music coming out of Coca Maya until 5:00 a.m. - A/C issues in Unit 302 that never got resolved while we were there - Limited family gathering space inside the unit (as compared to the private homes we typically rent on beach vacations is Destin, Florida). We stayed in the Beachside section of El Taj (which is really across the street from the beach but really nice and a very short stroll to the beach). We were in Unit 302 which is the largest in the property. There were nine of us so we needed all the space we could get. The only real lodging issues we had were the A/C was only working in portions of the unit so several of the bathrooms were hot (not much fun to take a shower in bathroom where there is no air moving). We reported the problem on Day 1 upon arrival and followed up several times but the problem only got partially resolved. Another thing to consider is the location of your unit (really the location of your bedroom windows) relative to the clubs down the street (Coco Maya and the Blue Parrott). Each night my wife and I would swear that the D.J. and his speakers were on our balcony...even though our unit was a far away as you can get on the Beachside from the clubs. The sound penetrated the master bedroom windows so much that you would swear they were open. Now are friends who were staying in the junior master on the same floor heard no music when they closed their door and went to bed each night. So...if you plan to stay in the master bedroom in Unit 302 bring some ear plugs. After night 3 I began to use my ear buds from my iPod and that helped tremendously. We are fun people and enjoy a good time but you have to understand that they party until 5:00 a.m. so it can be a long night. I don't think the music would be as much of an issue Oceanside vs. Beachside but it is something to be prepared for. Another piece of information we wish we would have known is that you are not allowed to bring coolers (even small ones like the one we had) into the beach area. The Indigo Beach club staff approached us almost immediately upon our arrival on the beach to inform us that our cooler was not allowed. The hotel should let you know this up front so you can be aware. They were forceful but not rude. Our plan was to bring some soft drinks and water to the beach each day and purchase our adult beverages from the beach club staff. Not a huge deal but again...it would have been nice to know this in advance. We used our cooler to store the cameras in the rest of the week so bringing it along wasn't a lost cause. The location of El Taj was super. Easy walk to 5th Avenue and all the great restaurants and shops. Easy walk to Mega Mart and Wal-Mart (definitely go to Mega and not Wal-Mart...much cleaner and much better selection). We would walk there to get groceries for lunch, etc and then take a taxi ($5USD) back. Very convenient. We had a great time at Xplore with zip lines and swimming in the cenotes. It is a lot of walking and stair climbing but a great time. Teresa the concierge got us passes for Xplore that were about $30 off the retail price per person. Also, take a cab to and from Xplore. It is well worth the small additional cost vs. riding on a bus with a bunch of folks and then having to stop at other resorts...especially along the way home when you are whipped and ready to chill in the hot tub. Restaurants we recommend are: Sur (there is also a homeade ice cream shop that you can see from the south side of Sur that is outstanding) Wicky's (great value for dinner) We also did lunch on the beach here one day and it was excellent (great burger and fries if you are missing the comfort food) Era Ora - very friendly staff and excellent Italian food and brick oven pizza - only one block from the hotel Agave Azul - they are just getting things organized and opened up but we had a blast dining outside. The wait staff was fun and we all ended up dancing to the music provided by the strolling guitarist who had a very interesting rendition of Jail House Rock. Mi Pueblo - excellent food and two for one drinks. Overall a super time at El Taj and unless you are determined to boogie board at the beach directly in front of your chairs, I would recommend it highly.", "Date": "July 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat place for all ages\u201d", "Author": "Ndubner", "ReviewID": "UR115047598", "Content": "This is our fourth return visit in two years. We stayed in all the condo hotel properties (they have 4 properties) and we think El Taj is the best one if you want to stay directly on the beach. We spent 5 days with 4 different families as a graduation gift for our kids. We rented several units el taj oceanfront and in beachside (across the street) and one of the units was \u00a0directly on the beach (unit 332 is directly on the beach, step out to the sand). The folks at the hotel asked us to share our experience on trip advisor and we honestly thought about keeping it a secret. But after learning that El Taj is ranked so high on trip advisor we thought it's time to let the secret out. This place rocks and it's the best of Playa! El Taj in the heart of Playa and everything at your fingertips. Our teenage kids used the GYM ( designed & operated by the founders of the famous Equinox Gyms) and said it was one of the best Gyms. The condos provide luxury appointments and amenities found only at the best hotels. Every detail was carefully planned out. The bedding and comfort was great. As repeat customers they surprised us with a luxury van and took us all to their private beach club called Al Cielo. Simply amazing beach and we are world travelers and never saw a beach quite like this. Make sure you ask the front desk about this beach club even though the beach in front of El taj (called Indigo) is awesome and amazing food.

We had organised an airport pick-up with the hotel and we were out of the airport and on the road swiftly with a cold drink and in an air-conditioned Escalade within minutes of walking out the airport doors. On arrival to the hotel the door staff were polite and very helpful in getting our bags from the car to the reception area. Check-in was friendly and swift and the porter who brought our bags to our room (Daniel) was pleasant and friendly and showed us how everything worked before leaving. We booked our condo directly with the owner and it was as beautiful as it looked in the photos. It was finished to a really high standard and had everything we needed even some good coffee to start our holiday. The kitchen was well equipped even for those who want to cook for themselves. The air-conditioning had separate controls for the livingroom and the bedroom which was great as the bedroom got a lot of sun and heated up a lot during the day. Our condo had a balcony with a beautiful ocean view and was the perfect place to have breakfast as it got the morning sun. We picked up groceries in the Mega supermarket so that we could make breakfast or brunch in the condo every morning and this worked out really well for us. We also cooked a couple of dinners in the condo, when we were too tired to leave the condo after being out on excursions, and they were fabulous too. The bedroom was beautiful and bright and the bed was very big and very comfortable. We had an additional bed made up in the living room and this was also very comfortable. There was plenty of closet space for three girls for a week. The bathroom was finished in a very luxurious style and had a very large shower area. We did have a leak at the sink on the second day which we reported to reception and they had a guy up and the leak repaired almost as soon as we had put down the phone. The pools at both El Taj Oceanfront and El Taj Beachside (just across the street) are fabulous. I especially loved the tranquil setting at Beachside and finished every day with a swim in that pool, a nice cool-down after a day on the beach. The beach itself is glorious and the there were always lots of sun beds and parasols at the beach club. Massages are available at the beach club but I didn't avail of this service so I can't comment but it's nice to have the option. We had breakfast at the beach club on our first morning and it was really nice, lots of fruit, cereals, meats, cheeses, pastries and cooked-to-order egg dishes and good coffee. We also had some snacks at beach which were good too, especially the pizza. I would also recommend the lemonade especially if you have built up a real thirst in the sun. Food and drink service at the beach club, we found, was efficient and polite. There is a sunglasses cleaning service at the towel bar at the beach club which I think is a great idea especially if, like me, you use loads and loads of sunscreen and your shades get all greasy. The beach itself is beautiful, the colours are just amazing and the sand is so soft and so white. It is by far the most beautiful town beach I've been on. I know some people complained about the boats in front of the hotel but I thought they added character to the view. As many other reviewers have said if you walk a short distance there are no boats to block access to the sea but what we found was if you walked out beyond the boats you got great space to have a peaceful swim as there weren't many other swimmers there and the boats don't move in and out enough to disturb you. The water is quite shallow for some distance out. We booked some excursions through Teresa at the Conceirge desk which is located at Maya Villa. She is just fabulous, very friendly, very knowledgeable and made good recommendations. We visited Tulum and Coba and also took a tip to Cozumel. If you're not sure exactly what you want to do Teresa will be able to help you make the right decision. The tours themselves were brilliant with fabulous transport (we were only 4 for the trips to the ruins so had an air-conditioned car with our own private guide). Our guide was very knowledgeable and had brilliant English (great as we all have really bad Spanish) so were able to get the most from the information he was giving. We had booked a snorkelling trip also but it was late in the week and the sea got too rough to do it. We would really have loved to have done it but maybe next time. The hotel is ideally located, right on the beach and just a short walk to Avienda 5 where all the shops and restaurants are. In the condo the hotel has provided a preferred guest card and a list of recommended restaurants (and other stuff too) whereby guests at El Taj get discounts. We availed of this on a few nights and had some really good meals, especially at Como Como and Yaxche. There is a lovely atmosphere in Playa Del Carmen, it's relaxed and colourful yet very chic and cosmopolitan. I would say there is something for everyone. All in all I really couldn't recommend this hotel high enough. It is perfectly located, it has lovely facilities, the gardens and setting are beautiful, and the staff are friendly, polite, efficient and understated (I especially like this as I really don't like hotel staff that are constantly in my face feigning interest with fake smiles). The condos are very spacious and are finished to such a high standard and it is just brilliant to have the freedom and autonomy of having your own place in the sun with all the service and amenities of a luxury hotel.

Great location, I practically walked everywhere. Shops, restaurants, clubs... everything is around. One would be curious about the noise level. We did not have any trouble falling asleep, nor were we awaken by the noise at anytime. The beach was nice, there were plenty of boats there, but once you go past them. White sand and clear water, definitely was not an issue there. Overall, I'm pretty much on the same page as most of the previous reviewers about what's good with El Taj. The negatives: the staff just was not the friendliest bunch. Hector at the front desk, and Theresa with excursions service, were awesome. They were the only people that went out of their way to make sure that we were enjoying our time at El Taj. Everyone else wouldn't even smile, we just didn't feel very welcomed there at all. The service at Indigo Beach Club was even worse. The first day I was there, they offered to put our beach towels on our lounge chairs for us. The rest of the time, they just gave us the towels. I did tip them the first time. They were extremely attentive to some of the guests, while totally ignored others. Unfortunately for us, we were not part of those lucky ones. One waiter, Carlos, was a total creep. He had a tendency to hang around female guests for long periods of time. At one point, he even laid down on one of the bed with the guest. Last, this has nothing to do with El Taj, but you may find this handy if it's your first time visiting Playa del Carmen. Be ready to be harassed non-stop for everything from food, massage, tours.... Everywhere you walk, you will have people in your face trying to get you to buy something from them.

They provide complimentary lounge chairs to El Taj guests and we recommend it highly because the other beach club has no boats parked in front.

If you want authentic Mexican food (inexpensive ) check out the restaurant next to Indigo on the side street. The towel guys at El Taj beach provide complimentary sun lotions and always offered to clean our sun glasses with a professional cleaning machine every day. Nice touch!

We have tried many of the hotels in Playa from 5 star, to all inclusives, to real simple and I must say this place is a wonderful find! We usually come to Playa and Cancun 3 times a year and each time we try different locations as so many wonderful new hotels keep popping up. We definitely have our favorite in Cancun but we have not found our favorite in Playa. Some times we like being right in the town and other times we like being a tad bit away like the Mayakoba or Maroma area. When we saw El Taj last year we knew we wanted to try it and we are so glad we did. It is so far the best spot we have found IN town. We stayed in unit 336 3 BR 3 BA penthouse with roof deck front facing ocean. I think this is by far the best unit along with unit 345. Both get the front views. There are only 2 units that have this complete view that also have the upstairs rooftop. From the deck, this unit by far, had the best view. Unobstructed ocean and beach views were amazing. As everyone has mentioned earlier, the condos are lovely and well appointed. Perfect location in town, 14th and the beach...can't get any better than that if you want to be in the heart of it. One or 2 nights we did hear a faint thump thump from the music at clubs down the street. It does get quiet at 2 however and this is very reasonable for an area with this much action. The front desk staff was great but several times were hard to reach throughout the day for questions. One of our few minor complaints of this place was room service availability. They stated they had it until 7 pm but several days (3 to be exact) no one answered the phones mid day(we tried for a long time) so we could not order food delivered up. We wanted drinks, snacks and lunch served up on the private deck and did not feel like cooking or going down to any of the restaurants...the private roof patio was so lovely it was hard not to want to use it. One day the room service did answer and we ordered and it was fabulous just hanging in the hot tub and looking down at the great view in private and enjoying great food and no clean up.... Chill. The one restaurant that is there is good and our room came with free breakfast which was enjoyed by all of us. The drinks and food were relatively expensive...more expensive than the Ritz, Rosewood or Banyon Tree, I was kind of surprised at this. There is only one restaurant on this property but many near by within walking distance. You could not sign to your room so you had to carry cash when you ate or drank. Knowing this was a condo unit we were not disappointed but had hoped for a little more condo/hotel amenities. I really do not want to complain because it was a lovely place. Another area that people speak about is the lack of beach in front of this property...yes, this is true. There are a few dozen fishing boats out front and we heard they are trying to change this. But for now you have to walk a few minutes to the right or left to go in the water with out knocking into the ropes from the boats...not really a big deal, the view is still stunning. It actually keeps the area much quieter. One other small complaint...It would be nice to not have to turn in a card every time you got a towel, (and you only get one towel)....It is too bad people take towels so they have to have these policies. This is one area the five star hotels shine in comparison. The housekeeping at this property was outstanding and truly amazing. They keep the rooms and grounds spotless at all times...really nice crew too. 10 stars to them! They stocked our kitchen with things I pre-ordered so we wouldn't have to go shopping upon arrival and this was a nice touch...really fair prices and only 25.00 extra bucks to have this done. We could just start relaxing right away. We stocked the unit with extra ice, liquor, coffee, fruit and makings for guac. Everything else is here. We never cooked meals as there are so many great restaurants in Playa to visit but it is really nice having a kitchen. The roof top deck is amazing and is huge. Lots of shade and sun and a hot tub that is great. There is a sink and refrigerator and a great grill. The pool at the property is not huge but plenty big...not a lap pool. It is great for small kids and lounging. The bathrooms are nice and we loved the hard bed. All rooms came with climate control and remote control fans.

We had the best stay and had such an amazing experience at El Taj! El Taj Condo Hotel is a quaint, upscale beachfront hotel located in the center of Playa del Carmen and right on the beach. You are less than a five-minute walk to all the best restaurants, bars and clubs. The hotel offers complimentary parking on site, and free access to the largest, upscale gym in Playa del Carmen (2 minute walk away). The hotel rooms are condos owned by private owners, but maintained by one company, so you get all the benefits of a full condo with all the services of an upscale hotel. The hotel was built in 2010, so everything is brand new with modern kitchens, spacious bedrooms, nice bathrooms, and each unit has a large balcony. The d\u00e9cor is very similar amongst all the units. The best units are the penthouses along the beachfront, which have amazing rooftop decks with full BBQ equipment, jazuzzi and lounge furniture. Fantastic views and a great beach right there!! Since it was our wedding we stayed in one of the penthouses and it was worth every penny. What a luxurious experience! Lourdes Diaz, the hotel manager, provided the best service! She took care of all of our guest reservations and booked transportation from the airport for some of our guests. The hotel offered generous discounts if we booked a certain number of rooms for our wedding. Our guests loved their stay there and still rave about it today! The staff was so friendly and helpful with all the things I needed for my wedding. I couldn\u2019t believe it. We dropped off our wedding dress and groom\u2019s suit at the front desk at the last minute and they got it steamed for us and delivered it to our room within 2-3 hours on the day of our wedding. The dress and suit looked great! They went above and beyond the call of duty. I really feel like they are family to me. The best thing about this hotel is that you are in the heart of the action of Playa del Carmen, but can also get a very quiet, private experience while staying at the hotel. There are two large, popular beach clubs two doors down from the hotel (one of them is the Blue Parrot with the famous fire show on the beach) and when you are in the rooms, you don\u2019t hear a thing. I was so surprised how quiet it is in the rooms. Since you are 1 block from the main street (5th Avenue), you don\u2019t get all the loud walking traffic late at night. Most people walk on 5th Avenue at night. The street in front of the hotel is very quiet. El Taj also has a beach club and restaurant called Indigo with a great continental breakfast and where you can get a nice lunch on the beach on one of their beach beds. Basically, you get all the benefits of an expensive all-inclusive resort, because it is on the beach, has numerous restaurants within a 10 minute walk, entertainment all around you, but at a fraction of the price of a fancy all-inclusive resort. The great thing about the condo is that many of the best units have 2-3 bedrooms, so you can travel with other couples or families and when you split the cost of the hotel it ends up being a great deal. Also, by having a full kitchen, you can save quite a bit of money on breakfast and lunch and not have to dine out all the time. There are a number of grocery stores close by. Plus, you save on cab rides because you are in the heart of the city. Everything is walking distance. Check out the website to see the amazing photos of the hotel --- www.eltaj.com. I highly recommend this hotel for a nice, relaxing stay in the heart of Playa del Carmen.

It is a pleasant 5 min walk to the bars, clubs and restaurants of a very attractive and friendly downtown. On the negative side, the pool is small, shaded and was chilly (it needs a heater in March). Ocean access is totally blocked by a lineup of fishing boats along the beach. You have to walk about 5 minutes to the South for ocean swimming. To the immediate north was a beach marred by extensive seaweed and sand-filled bags to control erosion. If ocean swimming is critical, you might be happier in a line of hotels about a 10-20 minute walk to the north; the beach itself at El Taj was very nice. Four out of 6 of us did experience Montezuma's revenge; bring Cipro, Imodium and Zofran. ( We didn't drink the water but we did eat freely in the restaurants...the unfortunate side of Mexico.)

Spring Break trips are always loaded with extra kids, this year we had 6 kids, actually young adults, ages 17 -25. We usually stay at one of the wonderful houses in Playacar Phase I to accommodate our crew. This year we stayed at El Taj Beachside 302 and all of our spring breaks have been great this was one \"over the top\". I cannot think of anything that would have made this trip more perfect. LOCATION. Whereas Playacar Phase I is about 3/4 mile south of \"Playa Central\". El Taj is Playa Central and beachfront. Great gourmet dining for the \"old folks\", that would be me and my wife is a short walk. The hottest bars are less than a block away which reassures these old folks our kids can make it home safely at 5 AM. I do not know how else to put it unless you are familiar with Playa, but the location alone makes this an ideal place to stay. SERVICE. Unparalleled. Each person I encountered, especially Frederick, truly wants to make your trip perfect. The service I received was very similar to the service at the Ritz or Four Seasons without the arrogance. There is a warmth and sincerity with the impeccable service. SAFETY. 24 hour attendant at the only entrance to this property. We never locked our door. Though I admit my own stupidity, I left my billfold on the nightstand when the maid was cleaning the unit and no one was \"home\". I never missed a penny. There are safes in the room, I just trusted our maid Elizabeth. ACCOMMODATIONS. These condos stand WAY apart from any other condos in Playa. The quality and maintenance is NOT available anywhere else in Playa. I'm sure Myakoba is equal in many ways but Myakoba is not in Playa and we love love to stay in Playa. BEACHSIDE VS BEACHFRONT. El Taj has 2 condo units and they share the same beach. We stayed beachside and the 50-75 yard walk was never a bother and I think the beachside units are actually larger. BEACH CLUB. This is actually sublet and not directly managed by El Taj. At least that is the impression I got. The food is great. At times, chairs and beach beds were a little tight; however, I always had a place to bask in the the sun. Although my kids are older, I saw many younger family who seemed to be experiencing the same pleasure. HIDDEN SECRET. A local restaurant Las Quesadillas just across a side street from El Taj has great, safe food for cheap. Chicken Quesadilla for 1.50 USD. Huge serving of guacamole made right before your eyes for 3.50 USD. THE GYM. We used it everyday. Nice gym. Spinning Classes with great spinners. Free. INTERNET/PHONE. Great deal. Some rooms it cost extra but if you purchase this package, the phone is international and allows you to call the states at no charge. This was great since we have elderly parents. As mentioned above, we have stayed in many wonderful places in Playa del Carmen but El Taj is in a category of its own. It has everything including a huge desire to please. NEGATIVE. The only negative is night time noise. Because it is in Playa Central, next to the hottest bars, the music is loud when these old folks are trying to sleep.

From the moment we were met at the airport, with our own personalized message board, to the cold towels, and water ready in the car for us, I could not believe the service. The concierge Teresa could not have been more helpful, as were all of the staff at the El Taj. With two teenage boys , we have a strict criteria of what works for us on holiday, we need local activities to keep them engaged, good food and lots of it:) without long drives out in the evening, and bedrooms with enough space for them to hang out- their own TVs and , of course, internet access! The El Taj provided all of this and more- from the moment you step in to the hotel, you realise that it has a quiet understated elegance. The condos are incredible- we stayed in #340, top floor penthouse and roof terrace with three beds, three baths- pure luxury! The beds were incredibly comfortable- despite earlier comments- I had some of the best night's sleep. The great deal on the privilege card- which we used every night to get a discount off the local restaurants. The boys did the ATV trip through the jungle- Teresa booked everything for us, and they really enjoyed it. We also did a private tour of Chichen Itza- where Teresa booked us a very comfortable car to take us there, and we had our own guide when we got there- much easier with teenage boys, who are not good at getting up at 7:40 am to get on the coach trip! We also tried out the hobie cat- which you can rent at the hotel next door. Our special treat was the private boat trip out snorkeling to Akumal- what an incredible place- and we felt spoiled having our own boat, lunch organised at a beachside bar- especially when we saw a pod of dolphins on our way home. I have been to many hotels over the years, traveled through Europe extensively and North America and this hotel has to be one of the best I have ever stayed at! We eat breakfast a couple of mornings down at the Beach Club- where the service again, was impeccable- they remembered which tea I liked and with milk- and were just so helpful. Best restaurants for us were: Yaxche, (ask for the cafe maya), Coccina 38- sticky toffee pudding:), La Casa del Aqua for the seafood platter( but watch the price there- it is expensive). Also liked 100 % Natural cafe on Ave 5- wonderful smoothies, and sandwiches freshly made, and very healthy. All the restaurants are steps away from the hotel- and such fun walking along Ave 5 at night, just to see the shops in full \"barter\" mode as you walk passed.

Keiki and Carlos at the Indigo Beachclub were so attentive we felt like they were our own personal staff. Location was also perfect. Avenida 5 was only two blocks away - we never needed a taxi and never felt uncomfortable walking. Food at Indigo was very good - we ate lunch there almost every day. We also found a little eatery that caters to locals across the alley from El Taj called Las Quesadillas serving baja style tacos and quesadillas only 150pesos. Delicious and cheap. EraOra just up the street serves great Italian food. Beds are a bit hard for my taste, but I still slept well. I could hear the music from Blue Parrot at night but it wasn't enough to keep me awake and I'm a light sleeper.", "Date": "March 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cA SPECTACULAR Stay in Playa Del Carmen\u201d", "Author": "Candice923", "ReviewID": "UR98088712", "Content": "I stayed at El Taj for two nights in the beginning of February, and it just wasn't long enough.

I had reserved a one bedroom unit, but two weeks before our arrival I requested a specific one bedroom unit if it was available during our stay. I was told that they could not guarantee a unit assignment in advance, which I could understand and had no problem with. When we arrived and were checking in at the oceanfront building, there were two employees at the desk, One was helpful, and the other was not. When I asked which unit I would be in, I was told that it was not the unit that I had requested. Again, not a problem, I completely understood. Here is what bothered me a bit..........When I asked if the unit that I had inquired about was available, the one guy blew me off and was basically ignoring me. The second guy actually looked, and told me that the unit I had requested was available. I didn't pursue the matter any more, I just figured what the hell.....I was just happy to be on vacation. Our room was nicely appointed, and overall I liked it. What I didn't like was that the bed was very hard and uncomfortable, just as some previous reviews had stated. In general I liked the look and feel of the property. We didn't go to Indigo beach club which is on the property, since the reviews I read were not great, and there were many more options in the area. I would have to say that the best thing about this property is the location. It is very close to 5th ave. Another nice perk is that when you check in they give you a preferred club discount card, which gives you either a 10% or 15% discount at several bars and restaurants in Playa. We used the pool at both the oceanfront and beachfront buildings. Both were nice, but were small, and because of their location, did not provide much sun. Most people prefer the beach when in PDC, but for those that would rather lounge at the pool, this is not the place for you. If you stay here I highly recommend that you go to Era Ora italian restaurant which is right around the corner and is located on 1st Ave. between calle 12 and 14. Great food, great amosphere, and great service! Would I stay at this property again?..........possibly...but probably not. While it was nice, it wasn't great......but everyone has different taste.

My wife and I with 3 young children stayed beachside in unit 307 with 2 bedrooms. My brother and his family stayed in unit 325 ocean front 3 bedroom penthouse. The location was excellent. For the money savings I actually preferred the beachside unit. Also,The 2 and 3 bedroom units are almost identical in layout and size. The difference is they made the bedrooms smaller in the 3 bedroom unit as well as the bathrooms. Our 2 bedroom units master bedroom was huge and the bathroom was very large with 2 sinks where as both the 2 bathrooms in the 3 bedroom unit were small. The beachside units walls had stone tile which was an added touch. They had white drywall in the ocean front units. The beachside pool was nicer than the ocean front pool. It was very quiet and private and made you feel like you were in a jungle setting with the many tropical plants and grass surrounding the pool. The dark blue tile in the beachside pool was amazing. Also, you only had to walk through a cross street, and walk through the ocean front condos lobby to get to the beach. The beach was great with the kids. The only downside is that the children cannot swim right in front of the hotel as there are fishing boats anchored there so you are not able to sit and watch your kids swim in the ocean from your beach chairs. We had to walk down the beach a bit to swim which we did not mind. The owner built a pier for the boats to be docked but the boat owners do not want to dock them there in fear they will become damaged hitting the docks by the waves. The boats are grandfathered to that location on the beach. The town and 5th avenue were just incredible. We took the kids out each night for shopping and ice cream. It is very safe. We recommend you get the chef service the concierge has available. Carlos, a private chef, will come to your condo and cook a authentic meal for you. He brings all his own ingredients and cooks in your kitchen. He will clean everything up as well. The food was some of the best we have ever had. The first night we had him cook we had tostados and tacos. It was an incredible meal and we were stuffed. The concierge had set up a pinatta for our childs birthday and filled it with candy for us. The service is hands on. For $35 we had them stock our condo with food,drinks and condiments. Just send them a list of what you want and they will stock your place for you. Lastly, the attention to detail and artifacts in both buildings was unbelievable. The wooden doors to the beach front entrance are 650 years old.

'Oceanside', in contrast, is actually on the beach, and most of its units have water views (although the quality would vary, as some are set far back towards the road). The front desk service was friendly and efficient. I had two different maintenance problems with my unit, one serious (water pouring in the ceiling from the unit above) but maintenance staff responded quickly. My big disappointment was the unit itself - 303. It was clearly one of the least desirable units in the whole complex - ground floor, dark, at the very back corner of the complex, overlooking parked cars. The interior, while clean and organized, looked like a mid-range suburban American 'suite hotel' rather than what was on the website. The week I was here, there were many other empty rooms, including a far more attractive one-bed on Oceanside, but the desk would not let me change because I booked through Expedia and was assigned to one specific room. So buyer beware, especially on Expedia. The larger units, on higher floors, especially near the water, look spectacular.

The lounge chairs were actually super comfortable and the live DJ on the weekends were great. The place just has a mixed feel of Mexican/ European/Bali feel to it. Great mix of people from all over the world. The restaurants and clubs are very close by, we did go down the street one night and went dancing. That was really fun!

In fact, several of us are planning on coming back with our families. Would be the perfect place to come with several families with kids the same ages.

Deciding to stay in the town itself and choosing the right place took careful consideration. Following the advice of friends (and checking reviews on Trip Advisor), we booked El Taj and can enthusiastically state what a terrific decision we made. From the amazingly helpful Eduardo on the 800 res line to the Front Office staff, everyone was concerned that we were happy and no request was disregarded. We liked our rooms (especially the terrace), it came with a private hot tub; the Indigo Restaurant at the beach had wonderful food and service. Don't miss breakfast and be sure and try the guacamole/chips and the wood oven pizzas. Everyone is cheerful and helpful. A few tips. Bartenders in Mexico pour to an ounce measure, so we learned quickly to order doubles (or a side shot to pour in) especially when ordering tropical type or margarita drinks, otherwise they were too weak. We did this in clubs, restaurants, everywhere. There is a lot of excellent food, but certain restaurants stand out. For example, Cocina 38 is a restaurant not to be missed whether with a group or as a couple. The hotel has a Privilege Card that gives a discount at a group of restaurants, USE THEIR LIST, you won't regret it. Same with their in house spa services including beach massages- and the gym nearby is free and totally modern.

It really was the best place to stay in Playa. We stayed in room 307 at the beachside which suited us fine. The weather wasn't the best while we were there, so we loved that the pool at beachside was enclosed so you couldn't feel the wind and it was slightly heated and the jacuzzi was very warm. We tried swimming at the oceanfront pool a few times, but the wind coming off the ocean made it cold. You can use both pools though, when staying at either El taj place, which is great, as both are nice. We were travelling with a 16month old and a 4 year old, so the two bedroom accommodation suited us great. It isn't a holiday if I have to stay in a hotel room with my kids in the room with me! All the furniture and appliances are new and great quality. And there is a washing machine and dryer in room 307, which is handy with kids. We stayed over christmas and new years eve, so we heard the worst there was of the loud music from the nightclub strip. Neither el Taj places are adjoining any nightclubs. Both adjoin other hotels, but they are very close to the nightclub strip. Maybe 50meters away. However in our room, we couldn't hear the noise at all. At beachside, all the main bedrooms face in towards the pool, so it blocks a lot of sound. The kids room faced over the empty block behind, which got a lot more noise, but nothing that you couldn't sleep through. It never affected the kids. It really wasn't loud enough. The location of El Taj is also perfect. I was actually surprised how close beachside was to the beach. I had thought it would be further away, but seriously, it took all of about 30 seconds to get to the beach. Across the small road (more like a laneway) and you walk straight through El Taj oceanfront. And it is fantastic being so close to 5th Ave. We didnt' want to stay at an all inclusive resort, as being able to walk down 5th Ave every night and discover new restaurants is so much a part of the fun. Or if you wanted to stay in one night, there are plenty of home delivery options. We could walk to 5th Ave in about 2 minutes. It really is perfectly located between the beach and the activity of 5th Av. The Indigo beach club was also great. It is breakfast buffet only and drinks up until 1pm though, but then lunches were great (albeit small), service good and great location. So that is about it I think to sum up. There is obviously no kids club, which some people want, but we wouldn' t have used it anyway. We also got the concierge to organize babysitting a few nights which was easy. It is US$20 and hour, which hurts when you live in South America and babysitting costs 1/4 of that, but both girls we had were professional (from some agency, not directly employed by the hotel). I would easily say for people that have kids and hate pokey hotel rooms, this is by far the best place to stay. Oh yeah the internet wifi was also good. It costs US$50 for the week and includes free international phone calls. And we hired a car for 3 days and parking underneath is also free.", "Date": "January 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "McLean, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and top notch quality\u201d", "Author": "Moss333", "ReviewID": "UR90426050", "Content": "Convenient location in the heart of Playa del Carmen and only one block from the beach.

The location is perfect, right on the beach between 12-14, the rooms are spacious, gorgeous, and very well appointed, the staff is friendly and helpful, and the beautiful beach is just steps away. Rooms: Simply put, I've never stayed in a better room. Our unit (#356) was a one-bedroom condo with a stove, fridge, cooking/eating utensils, HUGE couch, two flat screens with digital cable, floor to ceiling window in bedroom, big lovely bathroom, shower, big King Bed. The decor is a fusion of contemporary and tropical Balinese that blends really well. *nicks: bed is REALLY firm and pillows are huge a clunky. This didn't bother me but my girlfriend had to use a couch pillow. * notes: I would recommend asking for square footage when requesting available rooms. We learned that there was a 300 sq ft difference between equally priced one-bedroom units that you can't really discern from the pictures. So naturally we choose the largest one (#356 - 860 sq foot). Beach (Indigo Beach Club): The beach is beautiful, the day beds are heavenly and the food/drinks are overall good. *nicks: There are boats directly in front the resort so you need to stroll down the beach a bit or swim in between them. The chicken satay from Indigo was tiny. Not enough food for a single person appetizer. Pool/Jacuzzi: Well they look beautiful. But they are not heated and get no sunshine after noon, so we never stepped foot in. But we are beach people anyway. Service/Staff: Excellent. Everyone is so friendly! We had a few issues with our door lock and phone, and the staff fixed both in a timely manner. Security was very prevalent and premises were secure 24 hours. The only drawbacks: cool pools, no ice machine, fishing boats on beach, no room service or food for dinner. The positives: EVERYTHING ELSE. Love this place!

The sound of the ocean breaking, the Thai Chic beautiful d\u00e9cor and objects around, manicured grounds and a staff eager to please! This hotel is RIGHT ON THE BEACH. Unobstructed OCEAN VIEWS that can\u2019t be beat. The beds were hard but comfortable. Luxurious bedding. Plasma TVs with satellite in every room, AC pumped, wrap around terraces with many seating areas. This place is phenomenal! The location could not be beat. In the center of all the action. We didn\u2019t have to take a taxi at all. I emailed the concierge staff in advance with many varied requests. Emails back were responded to quickly with very detailed information. Some of the requests included grocery service. I sent a list of 30+ items and everything was in my condo upon arrival. We used the hotel recommend transportation. Drivers were waiting with my name in large bold easy to find. Vehicles were clean and drivers very professional. Check in quick. Other requests included Chef Services. We used Carlos and Tania from Epicurean Chef. What a nice couple and phenomenal meal. Sangria, Margaritas, appetizers, grilled freshly caught fish on our rooftop terrace. Is this for real?? I mean it just kept getting better. The Concierge staff here went above and beyond any 5 star properties. Whatever you need they were eager to please. Special thanks to DANIEL who spent an entire day finding a type of wine then going to pick it up on his own personal time. Oh and birthday cake needed.. Not a problem. Daniel will go to the bakery to get it. Dinner reservations with prime table space at Fusion hotel - DONE. Anything we wanted we received. Also special thanks to ERIC S. Eager to answer any of the 101 questions we had. Make dinner recommendations, nightlife suggestions. ANYTHING! Also thanks to Hector, Frederick and Flor. I mean I feel like the El TAJ staff is part of my family! The location also couldn\u2019t be beat. One block from 5th avenue and all the shops and restaurants. Though close to all the 12th street clubs and action, I never heard a sound at night. Except from the Ocean! Oh and no bugs!! Not one mosquito, fly or anything. We also used the Maya Spa at one of the sister properties. Incredible massage and body wrap at a reasonable price. The gym is comparable to Equinox in NYC where we live. Indigo restaurant and the staff especially Juan, also fantastic. Our condo included daily breakfast. Delicious coffee, incredible omelets and fresh bread. The lunch food was also delicious, best Guacamole, Fried Calamari, Tuna Sashimi and Thin crust pizza. Loved the Buddha bar type music playing and the comfortable beds. The only negative was some construction going on at the Pier in front. Nothing the El Taj could do. The Gran Portal Real was nearby to the left and I see the rave reviews but it looked like the hotel was close to falling into the ocean. Many sandbags holding the beach dunes. The chairs there all close together with a lot of \u201cpink\u201d looking people. I mean this is Mexico, how about some sunblock! The beach in Playa is magnificent. Some friends took the 8:30am Yoga on the beach class. Wonderful! I\u2019m still in shocked that in my world travels I have not been to playa sooner. The local people here are the nicest I have ever met!! The only rude person was some Canadian guy trying to sell us Coco Bongo tickets on the beach. Safety... not a concern at any point of the day or night and we were on the beach for an early am run and walking home from the bars in the wee hours. The El Taj also had security at night on the beach and the perimeter was roped off. Other notable restaurants during our stay: LA PARILLA - very touristy but GREAT drinks and decent food. FUSION \u2013 good meal, great entertainment and how nice to sit with your feet in the sand (similar to the Office in Cabo), so so service but the management could not be more apologetic. SEASON - BEST MEAL. Juan and his staff were very accommodating. NYC style restaurant and atmosphere. Lobster, steak, wine, beautifully presented and Delicious! COMO COMO \u2013 Italian, homemade pasta small place very crowded. Also highly recommend. For Drinks, frequently the DESEO.. bartender\u2019s also knew us on first name basis. Great drinks and atmosphere. Went to Coco Bongo. MUCH better than expected. Moulin Rouge experience. Had bottle table service which made difference. A representative came to the El Taj and I pre picked and paid for my liquor selections. Also LA SANTERNA.. great outdoor space and dancing after Coco Bongo. REINA ROYAL \u2013 Funky place like you walked into an Old Navy Commercial and the Blue Parrot of course. Shopping \u2013 great ceramic shop on the corner. Close by the Tequila factory and bazar for souvenirs. Lots of bargaining to be had if you are in the mood. Playa itself had a very international feel. Many times we felt we were in a seaside village in Spain like Sitges or Porto Banus. We met tourists from around the world. In summary, I highly recommend the El Taj for all of the reasons above.

I'll begin with their excellent location ~ directly on the beach and in the heart of playa del carmen close to great restaurants, activities, shops and bar/clubs. Once you walk inside the grounds of El Taj you feel like you are in a different world with materials brought in from Bali , an amazing infiniti pool and plants lining the terraces. The service is outstanding. Beach club includes a variety of lounge chairs (the most comfortable style i must add), sitting areas and palapas. Beach service is provided by Indigo Blue (their beach club/restaurant). Try their amazing pineapple cured tuna ceviche with homeade beet chips. The construction is amazing ~ once you are in your residence it is completely silent ~ i slept so well. I also felt very safe as they have security 24/7.

The condo (357) was exactly as depicted in its photos--nicely decorated, clean, neat and accomodating. The layout was very amenable to a family staying there as the 2 bedrooms were separated by the living area and kitchen. The private balcony between the two bedrooms was helpful as it allowed the children to go \"outside\" but not wander. Having a washer and dryer on site as well as the refrigerator with basic kitchen items was helpful with the children as we were able to pack lighter and do some laundry while there and buy some groceries to have milk, juice and other children friendly snacks on hand. The condo had daily maid service which helped tremendously with the beach sand that we inevitably tracked in despite our efforts. The condo also had 3 thermostats--1 in each bedroom and 1 in the common area--very helpful! The only change I would make to the condo interior would be to change the shower head in the master bath as it sprays all over the place and cannot be adjusted. The private rooftop deck and jacuzzi are very nice. We shared access to the roof with another unit (via a stairway), but once on the roof, there were two separate areas with some privacy. We did have difficulty getting the jets on the jacuzzi to work, unfortunately. As for the El Taj facility, it is still new and in very good shape. The pool is beautiful and the perfect size for the the number of units and guests. It was never very crowded. The beach club outside El Taj Ocean was more crowded, presumably because it allowed access to those staying at other El Taj properties. Obtaining beach towels was usually an ordeal as the attendant never seemed to be at the station, and on one occasion, ran out of towels. The proximity of this property to the beach can't get any better--take three steps out the pool and you're in white sand. We did find the elevator (we were on the 4th floor) to be rather slow and very hot. (Apparently, it is not air conditioned.) There is a restaurant on site at El Taj Ocean where we had breakfast. I wouldn't recommend it for a family with small children. It's a buffet style from 8 a.m.-12 p.m. The \"cold\" breakfast items sit on the bar during this time which means bees fly to the muffins with honey and the milk (powdered milk made liquid) is room temperature. The breakfast was about $10 a person, but since our kids just ate the little boxes of cereal and/or toast, it wasn't really worth it. El Taj Ocean is very close to 5th Avenue, which is full of tourist restaurants and shops. If you're looking for an authentic but quiet restaurant, that's not the place to go. As mentioned, after the first day, we treked to the Super Walmart and bought some items for the condo. We walked there but took a taxi back due to the bags. There were plenty of taxis on site, and it was only $4 to return to the condo. Although there were a few items in the condo refrigerator for purchase, they weren't items we needed for children, so it was worth the trip to the store. Although on the beach, the condo itself was relatively quiet despite its proximity to nearby clubs and restaurants. Only one night did we have a problem with the noise--a disc jockey on a microphone at someplace nearby--but it did not last late. The staff at El Taj Ocean was very helpful and professional. The front desk attendants assisted in making reservations at the Hidden Worlds park and called Cancun Valet when our airport transport was running a few minutes behind schedule. Overall, we were very pleased with the accomodations and have already recommended it to friends.", "Date": "August 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful & luxurious.

We stayed in #333, and it couldn't have been more perfect. We were looking for something special...not generic! Everything is clean, cool and comfortable. Marble floors, granite counters, chic furniture, and a serious view of the caribbean!! Super tasteful, streamlined decor. Large living room, full kitchen, 3 bedrooms, each with a bath. Large balcony with private jacuzzi! Situated right on the beach with an awesome beach club (beach chairs/umbrellas, full restaurant with excellent food). And the pool overlooks the beach, so you are never without that amazing ocean view. We traveled with children and it was especially convenient to be steps away from room, pool, and beach. Impeccable, friendly, helpful service. The property in general is a sublime experience. Lush foliage, rustling palm trees, sparkling sea. It is especially magical at night. Something about the air and the iridescence. In regard to the hotel's proximity to town, it's just steps away from the super cool 5th Ave. Fine restaurants, cool shops. If you've never been to \"Playa,\" I highly recommend it. Very international crowd. All different kinds of fine cuisine, from Mexican to Italian to Thai. Homemade pizza & gelato! Truly a beach vacation combined with amazing culinary delights! If you're looking for nightlife, you won't be disappointed. Super cool lounges & beach parties with a distinct \"Playa\" vibe, totally different from overdeveloped Cancun. Then of course there's the Mayan Riviera itself!
