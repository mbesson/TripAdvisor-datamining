{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Perfect stay in typical Chinese hotel I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. It's a great place to stay!If you have enaough of the amarican/european way of staying in a hotel, this is your place to stay.The staff speaks good English.The rooms are great, but make sure you get an updated one, becouse they were renovating while I was there. The old rooms were not that great. The updated rooms were $10 more expensive but it was worth the money.The breakfast is typical Chinese and tasted very good!!! But than again, you must be a fan for asian food like me.In the beasement is a great massage/pool/wellness centre. Enjoy it!", "Date": "Nov 12, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR252334796", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Basawake"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d447380-r10775463-Yu_Long_Hotel-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "447380", "Price": "$49"}}
