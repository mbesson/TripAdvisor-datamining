{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Fraudsters This hotel was full of drug users. It was dirty and unkempt and incredulously noisey - well into the early hours of the morning, night after night with their incessant noise!!! Pacific Equities West are slumlords, they don't care about any of your problems here. Their offices are less than 200 yards from this hotel but it may as well be 2,000 miles away becasue they will ignore you every time - time and time again. The laundry facilities in the building didn't work for over a month...they just didn't care at all. They never saw it as their problem.When you move in they tell you that there is no need to do an walk-through appraisal...even though its the law in San Francisco. But when you leave they use this against you and any damage that was already in the room when you moved in, you will be charged for when you leave. They don't even do a closing walk through (as the law requires) they just send you a letter telling you that you are not getting your deposit back and list a bunch of damage...that was already there when you first moved in. I was not the only person to get this treatment.Angelos Kolobotos is deceitful, dishonest and rude, he is running a scam at this hotel. Beware-Stay away from these shady people.", "Date": "Mar 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR588171551", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "rvertigo"}, {"Content": "Oh the noise I stayed in the James Court Hotel for 2 months during the summer. The location is great and the rooms are fine if a little small and with no bathroom or sink it is a little annoying.The staff that run it own the Nob Hill hotel on near by Hyde St. I found them to be rude and uncooperative. They are eager to rent rooms but failed to tell us that the hotel is actually a dorm for local culinary students 90% of whom must be deaf (if the level that their music is played at is anything to go by) and also insomniacs since they like running up and down the stairs till 5am screaming at the top of their voices. Also their no smoking policy is a joke as people smoke all over the hotel which you will discover when your room starts to stink of cigarettes.If this is what you are into then great. Go for it. I however like to get more than 0 hours sleep a night so found it wasnt for me.Goodluck!!!", "Date": "Jan 9, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR432409912", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60713-d226827-r14263082-Nob_Hill_Express_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html", "HotelID": "226827", "Price": "$75"}}
