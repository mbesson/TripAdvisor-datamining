During the day we left and upon our return, we noticed a handbag missing. We searched and other valuables were there but the whole handbag was gone. I reported it to reception. They called the next morning to advise that the cleaner did not have it. When we said we would be reporting it to police, I was told they would check again, but again to no avail. Upon checkout we spoke to the manager who seemed very dismissive. Eventually they agreed to make a police report. We were then called to say that not one cleaner as per originally stated but two cleaners had cleaned our apartment and the second cleaner noticed a door open.

Secure undercover parking was important to me, and access to the apartment was internal and straightforward. The cooktop scenario is a bit funny; there are a whole lot of instructions about not only putting the rangehood onto full but having to open the sliding glass door across the room (in order to not set off smoke alarms). It also would have been nicer to have a mini bar option; fortunately there are plenty of food and shopping options nearby in Glebe, Newtown and Annandale, and there's also a cafe attached to the hotel/apartments (though it's a daytime sort of thing I think). The bed was really comfortable; there was a wall mounted tv in the second bedroom that has single beds, but not one in the main bedroom. In any case, with wireless internet for what I thought was a reasonable fee, I could watch ABC iView anywhere in the apartment which was great (and good because no pay tv or pay movies in-house).

The worst aspect was the bed: a roller-coaster of a thing which combined a slope, a hump in the middle, and a few dodgy springs.

The hotel urgently needs a bed replacement programme - I've slept in much better beds in backpackers'. Oh, and don't rely on the taxi ordering service on your in-room telephone: I waited 40 minutes for a taxi that never turned up, despite the best efforts of the very helpful chap on reception to chase it up for me with the taxi company.
