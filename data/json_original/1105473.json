{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Nice hotel in a pleasant suburb of Tokyo The Komaba is situated a little out of Tokyo, but fairly easy to access (2 stops on the underground from Shibuya - but you may need help locating the right part of the station), then 10 min walk through small streets. The hotel is the usual many-floored square box; the rooms are a little old-fashioned, but quite comfortable. Unlike many Tokyo hotels, which have frosted glass in bedrooms, we could look out of the window, and had a wonderful view of the Tokyo skyline, particularly at night. The breakfast (1000 yen, if I remember correctly) was copious and had all the elements of a good Japanese breakfast and also a western breakfast. Lunch was good too, and not expensive.The staff were pleasant, and many of them spoke English. A free English language newspaper was available in the hall.Nearby (about 10 min walk from the underground station, but in the other direction) is the very interesting crafts museum, the Mingei-kan.We thought the hotel was quite good value for money, and returned the following month for a second visit.If it's raining (which it did often during our stay), check out the umbrella park at the front entrance - very useful.", "Date": "Aug 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR883628258", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "SylviaKath"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066450-d1105473-r18896280-Komaba_Eminence-Meguro_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "1105473", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
