The rooms are extremely basic and the beds are hard! The service is far from wonderful - the staff will not go out of their way to make your stay more enjoyable. The breakfast is also very basic. It's not that the place is bad at all, its simply extremely average in every way, which I suppose is reflected in its price. To its benefit, it is located near U-bahn stations, which is good to get around town. Also, its a short walk to Potsdamer Platz and the Reichstag/Unter den Linden area (which is where most touristy things are).

I should have known in advance - as a general rule it is always better to find accommodation in the East of the city. Anything you will want to do will be in the 'Mitte' area which is in the East. On arrival I was extremely concerned by the location of the hotel. There was a sex shop on the corner opposite it and lots of 'working girls' in the street next to the one the hotel is situated in. As a lone female traveller I was rather uncertain about even staying in the hotel given its situation. The hotel is situated close to two main U-Bahn station which makes it easy to escape the area. I just stuck to taxis when returning at night to the hotel. The hotel itself is fine. The hotel staff are extremely friendly and helpful and there is a 24 hour reception. (You have to buzz to get in after a certain time.) You also drop your key off when leaving the hotel which gives you one less thing to worry about carrying around with you during the day! I was a little disappointed with the room. I stayed in the Circus Hostel the year before and was really impressed by the size of the room I had there - and this has been my usual experience of hotels in Berlin. My single bed was not very comfortable - quite narrow. So narrow I was scared to turn over for fear of falling out of bed! The window didn't close either which made it noisy at night! On the plus side there was a good shower room with a fairly decent shower cubicle. There was also a mini bar which was free to use(!) and a TV in the room with a mixture of English language and German language stations. I would be reluctant to recommend this to anyone visiting Berlin - especially for the first time! Berlin is a safe city and very pleasant city to stay in . This has got to be the first time I have felt unsafe or uncomfortable walking around the city on my own. There are many better hotels in the city - and also the excellent Circus Hostel. Try elsewhere before settling for this hotel.", "Date": "July 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cOne Star at Best\u201d", "Author": "KeepinItSimple", "ReviewID": "UR6231259", "Content": "Motel 6 meets Youth Hostel accomodations a la' 1980s with a 60's facade.", "Date": "November 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cOut of the way hotel\u201d", "Author": "Laura2610", "ReviewID": "UR5800089", "Content": "Although there was an U-Bahn line very near to the hotel, it wasn't really within walking distance of anywhere nice to eat or drink or any shopping facilities other than small supermarkets. The reception and breakfast area are very small, although the receptionists were generally friendly and helpful. We had breakfast just one of the mornings we stayed; it wasn't included in the price and was a bit expensive for what was available. Our room was large, with a good bathroom. There was a mini-fridge (very helpful in the middle of summer) and a large balcony outside which we shared with one other room. The only problem with the room was the fact that the door onto the balcony was the only means of getting air into the room and it only opened out wide. This meant leaving the door open wide all night, which wasn't ideal as our balcony was accessible from all the floors of the hotel. There were no fans available in the hotel, so the room was always uncomfortably hot.
