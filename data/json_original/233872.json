U-bahn no 2 is a short walk away with connections to Alexanderplatz and Zoo. The hotel has a very small reception/common area but the room was very large and of good quality. It was a corner room with great views out to the Leipziger Strasse, although in December this doesn't mean much. Despite location we did not hear the cars in the street. The room had the necessary amenities including more satellite channels than anywhere I've ever been (Thai, Japansese and what not). Prices are fair in Berlin, the minibar had 25 cl wine bottles for 5 euro for example. Breakfast was great in the large Lowenbrau restaurant which is connected to the hotel.

The rooms are adequately large with OK bathrooms (shower stall not tub; included hairdryer & soap) and small TVs (two English-language news channels). The bed was a bit lumpy but OK. The staff works in a cramped little lobby/office area. They are helpful and friendly. But there is no lobby area as such if you wish to \"get away\" from your room or read late at night when jet lag occurs. Here are the \"extras\": First, to get wifi, you must pay a daily or weekly rate. Ouch. There is a Starbucks three blocks or so away on Friedrichstrasse with free wifi. Second, the breakfast is not included but 10 Euros extra. The staff is quite up front about this but please ask if price is critical for you. There is a market less than 100 meters away for do it yourself breakfast folks. Overall, I still give it 4 stars because of the friendly staff, reasonable prices (for Berlin) and great location. The Stadtmitte Ubahn station is two blocks away and there are numerous good eateries just north of the hotel in the general Gendarmenmarkt / Friedrichstrasse area. And for you folks who consume your meals in liter steins, there is a Lowenbrau restaurant on the street next to the hotel entrance.", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ostend, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cabsolute success\u201d", "Author": "Moortgat", "ReviewID": "UR103271249", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel from 23 to 29 march 2011 and overall it was a very pleasant experience.We had a very spacious room on the second floor,very claean and well furnished,the beds were very comfortable.Bathroom also first class.I Breakfast was more than adequate,coffee very good.

It's a modern(-ish) and clean place, close to a lot of interesting places, and pretty much in the middle of everything (though I'd probably rather stay in Kreuzberg, Prenzlauer Berg or even Friedrichshain). Anyway, I just wanted to register one very large complaint: Nowhere in the hotel - not the rooms, not the lobby, not the restaurant - is it possible to get a cup of coffee outside of breakfast opening hours! The minibar was ridiculously overstuffed, but no coffee. And the receptionist, nice and friendly as she was, didn't know where to get a cup nearby. Luckily I found one (1!) cafe that was open until 9 pm - all the other, Starbucks, Einstein, etc. closed earlier) - so I got my fix, but it's very close to being a dealbreaker when you're on a business trip and need to work in the evenings. Oh, and by the way - the paid wifi is pretty expensive and only has 30 or 120 minute deals. I really, really hate that - I would rather pay an extra 10-20 Euro per night and have free wifi and not have to bother with paying and registering credit cards and so on.

The price was \u20ac88 pn for a standard double \u2013 not quite such a bargain when I discovered it didn't include breakfast (which was \u20ac10 pppd extra), but still reasonable value I think. It bills itself as 4* but I'd say it is 3* and resembles a mid-priced chain hotel. The room & bathroom were both quite adequate and clean. The location was very good \u2013 walking distance to most of the Mitte sights, restaurants, etc; but also very close to the Stadtmitte underground station which has 2 lines serving lots of other places. We probably wouldn't stay there again, though, due to the unhelpfulness of the staff we encountered. The one time we tried the breakfast the woman on duty seemed positively hostile, and propped open the door on to the street 15 minutes before the official end-time for breakfast (in March !!) to try to get rid of us. And when I came to pay the bill the receptionist said there was a problem with my debit card (which I'd been using elsewhere throughout our stay), I phoned my bank and found an authorisation request hadn't even been received, the receptionist continued to insist it was my problem until I gave in & went out to get cash from an ATM to pay the bill (as we had a flight to catch). I had suggested paying by international transfer when I got home (which I've done once before when a hotel's POS equipment wasn't working), but got the impression that she wasn't going to let us leave the hotel without paying.", "Date": "October 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kigali, Rwanda", "Title": "\u201cBasic but modern!\u201d", "Author": "BerlinerPooh", "ReviewID": "UR3015645", "Content": "My husband and I spent a week here on our first visit to Berlin. We chose this hotel because it is located right in the middle of the city (East) and within easy walking distance of attractions, U-Bahn and posh shops! There is no sprawling reception area, just a desk as soon as you enter and the lift is right there. The outside of the hotel looks like an office block and it faces a very busy main highway - we got a room facing a side street which was fairly quiet. The airconditioning was just a vent blowing air and made little difference to the room temperature. It was hot so we slept with open windows and threw the wonderful fluffy winter duvets on the floor! The room was very spacious, welcoming and furnishings were brand new, understated, tasteful and comfortable. The double bed was huge and as is common in Germany, with two mattresses - lovely if your partner bounces around a lot like mine does! The bathroom was of adequate size, all new and sparkling with chrome fittings, black and white everything ... all very colour coordinated. There was ample hallway space for luggage and a good size wardrobe with large dressing mirror. There was a TV (no English channels at that time), desk and a nice seating area. The breakfast was served in a small room which did not have quite the feel of a restaurant and the food was reasonable. We ate dinner a couple of times in the Bavarian restaurant downstairs and a little Italian restaurant up the road ... both very good. This hotel has no extra frills but value for money it is and ideal for business people. Not much emphasis is placed on service but it is not that kind of hotel. You are left much to your own devices but we were quite happy to just get on with it.
