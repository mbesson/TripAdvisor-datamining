We found the hotel relatively easy with the help of the GPS on my phone - it is a short walk away from the Ledru Rollin metro station on line 8. The staff were really friendly and helpful - sorted all our needs out and couldnt do enough for us. The room was lovely - it had two single beds in, a wall mounted flat screen telly, a wee table with T&C making facilities on and a very modern en suite bathroom with lovely toiletries, a hairdryer and wall mounted magnified shaving mirror. There was wardrobe space with hangers provided AND a free of charge safe, perfect for our passports and valuables. The room itself was very tastefully decorated with double sliding patio type doors, shutters AND thick black curtains - perfect if you want a lie in! - but theres so much to see and do, who would want to lie in?? There are other reviews about the room being small, but what do you want to do in it - there was plenty of room for us two and our luggage - no problem at all. A walk slightly beyond Ledru Rollin metro is the Bastille metro (line 5) and the Bastille itself - loads and loads of cafes bars and restaurants. Looks lovely at night, all lit up. Pick up a map from the hotel reception and walk around the city - we saw lots and lots - tiring but great fun. We had also booked a City Segway Tour online before we went (\u00a370 each) - what a fantastic laugh that was - saw loads more of the city in a fun way - worth every penny!! i would like to recommend an Italian restaurant a very short walk away (5mins) from the hotel. Its called Dell Isola and is on the rue du Faubourg st Antoine. Very good value for money, tasty big portions and really friendly staff. There is an amazing patisserie on the end of the street from the hotel - croissants and pastries to die for if you dont take brekkie in the hotel - we didnt, we just did our own thing. And of course there is a McDonalds nearby, just past the Ledru Rollin metro if you prefer that. We had a fantastic stay in Paris and having this lovely, warm, friendly hotel to go back to made our stay even better. Thank you - i will recommend it to friends and i hope anyone who goes there has a positive stay like us. (booked online with Venere.com 250 euros for 2 of us for 2 nights - i thought this was okay for the Bastille area of Paris).", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, very clean, friendly and helpful staff\u201d", "Author": "sonja f", "ReviewID": "UR119983602", "Content": "I really enjoyed my stay.

We took a Terrace room (recommended as the rooms are small but very clean and functional). Sitting out early mornings and late evenings was a delight and we enjoyed the late September Indian summer. Hotel staff were very efficient and friendly, every recommendation was excellent, especially the restaurant at the end of the adjacent laneway (L'ebeauchoir - we ate there 3 nights - so good). Not a touristy area and we found ourselves conversing with the locals who were all wonderfully friendly and hepful. for breakfast, try La Chat Bossu (translates something like the Bent Cat or Hunchback Cat - everything super fresh!). Each morning we found a fresh farmers' market about 30 metres from our hotel door anf an abundance of great cafes and eateries. Also very close to the Theatre Main d'Or where you must catch the brilliantly funny show \"How to be a Parisian in One Hour\".

It was about an 8 minute walk to the Op\u00e9ra metro station and maybe a 10-12 minute metro ride to Ledru-Rollins. The check-in was good and as we arrived fairly early we were fully prepared to be told we'd have to wait for our room to be ready. Luckily, they had a room ready for us when we arrived. The room was comfortable and quiet and the facilities were clean. The WiFi is free and worked well. The bathroom had a shower and tub which was nice. There is a rooftop terrace that was perfect for sharing a glass of wine as the sun is setting after a day of sight-seeing .The staff was helpful with restaurant recommendations and were good about any requests we had.

You can obviously get a taxi and it's a 3 minute drive but i just like walking everywhere! The shower was terrific - good pressure and the bath itself nice and big if you want to take a load off, the bed and pillows in my double room was really comfy I slept very well both nights.

Breakfast - continental - self service cereal and jams and boiled eggs etc and you get brought a basket of bread and a large croissant. Decent without being spectacular. Location-wise it's really well placed to get everywhere without being in the expensive part of town, and there's even a nice roof terrace to chill and read a book or plan your day.

My first impression of the Paname was good since I first emailed to make sure the transfer was OK and we really had a place to stay since it was all already paid for - I got a nice reply right away! The hotel is situated on a relatively quiet street and the two closest metro stops are Ledru-Rollin and Faidherbe Chaligny. The walk to the Bastille isn't too long either, should one prefer that. The neighborhood is typically Parisian, with shops, caf\u00e9s, restaurants, pharmacies and even one or two lively, colorful markets. We arrived at around 12 noon and were told that check-in started at 1 pm. That info wasn't really clear on the website and not on Hotels.com either, so keep in mind to show up after 1 o'clock. Our room was very nice, situated on the first floor, with a view towards the street. It was clean, comfortable and tastefully decorated. We had a big bathroom with a bathtub, hairdryer and fresh, clean towels. The toilet itself was in a smaller separate section. The bed was large, clean and comfortable, with a lot of pillows. There was a kettle and tea, coffee and milk at our disposal, free of charge, as well as wireless internet connection, also free of charge. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel, but it's available for an extra amount and there is also a bar. We didn't spend much time on the rooftop terrace either, but we checked it out and it was nice. The only real complaint I have is that their booking system doesn't seem to work properly and check-out is such a big deal. We were \"unlucky\" enough to have to check-out early in the morning, and the male receptionist wasn't able to find our booking and he couldn't see it was all already paid for. He was going to charge us for parking as well, although we never booked that since we don't have a car. Make sure to print a receipt once you book, especially if you book through another site than the hotel's, and point out the evening before that you intend to check-out in the morning. The rest of the staff was very friendly and helpful, they spoke both English and French and I think a couple of them even speak Spanish. We needed a pharmacy on a Sunday, when most are closed, and we were given helpful directions at the front desk. I would have rated the overall experience as \"Very good\" but the check-out complications were a bit stressful, thus the \"Average\" rating.
