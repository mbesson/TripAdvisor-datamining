We arrived early at the hotel and were allowed to check-in much earlier. The front desk staff at the third floor were friendly and accommodating and very quick in acting on requests. \u00a0We were even assisted in packaging our additional luggage. I can say that excellent service is present in all areas - \u00a0entrance/lobby , \u00a0front desk, restaurant. Even the manager and supervisor were assisting personally all the guests. \u00a0We are also happy on the tasteful buffet breakfast with many selections and very nice ambience. Most of all, the place is actually at the center of the city with just a few steps from City Hall MRT and several other malls, fast food chains, supermarkets, and tourist spots. \u00a0We are all satisfied with this hotel/recreation club.

So you need to be aware you are subject to club rules. Initially this really put me off and made me feel a bit weary. I am after all on holiday. At check in they explain the rules, no shorts in certain area etc. Check in was a breeze and the staff are lovely. The room is in keeping with the club, sort of older style with dark woods and carpet. However I liked the place and I soon forgot about the few rules they impose. For what I paid the room was amazing value and of a very high standard. The view of the Padang rally is incredible. Bathroom was so modern and clean and I liked the nice touches like the orchids in the bathroom. I went to explore and had a drink in one of the bars. The clubs bars weren\u2019t at all for me. They are tired and in real need of renovation. I did use the pool which is great and the breakfast was excellent. I didn\u2019t mind that they serve it in the pool bar.

I booked at 10 hotels from Agoda booking.com but somehow I was not happy with my selection. It took me two weeks to find this hotel. Thank God there is a Trip Advisor review. With little bit more money to add to my hotel budget, this is \"D\" hotel for me. This hotel is not a typical a high rise hotel. It doesn't have a big lobby with bus load of tourist. It has only 26 rooms.. though it is perfect for me coz I do not like crowded lobby and high rise building. We do have a view of the Pandang field. Residence at SRC is centrally located on the corner of 3 main roads, Stamford Road, Beach road (where Singapore Landmark Raffle Hotel is located) and Connaught Drive a triangle distance to Raffle City (a mall and where you can ride the MRT), Esplanade Mall (Durian Bldg) and Marina Square, You can actually have a pleasant stroll to Marina Bay Sands from this area. Oh by the way, a church is also walking distance to the hotel along Brash Basah Road. Breakfast is very good (buffet) and will rate it 3 1/2. They make perfect egg omelette. One minor flaw is that before you get to the restaurant, (Basement 1) the chlorine smelling hall welcomes you as you open the door to the breakfast dining room. Hotel bathroom is clean modern and it smells good. It has black granite tiles flooring, mosaic and frosted glass walls. It has the amenities of a 4 star hotel! shampoo, toothbrush lotions, etc. I did not check the other areas of the hotel because these areas are mainly for the use of club members but, as a guest, you can access the place provided you follow the dress code requirement of the Club.

By chance, I came across a room on the ground floor with slot machines but didn't go in. Lot of good shopping at Raffle City and we loved the food court.

Visiting last week to see Kevin Spacey in Richard III, I had decided to cut the stay to just one night - until I read about this hotel very close to the Esplanade Theatres and its much more reasonable rates. So my one night became two! As others have noted, this is not a hotel; it is the top floor of the very low rise Recreation Club. Try to get a room on the Padang side. Not only do you avoid traffic noise, you will have a wonderful view of the early morning sun hitting the business district behind the Padang. I had no problem with the size of the room. The shower room may be smallish (no bath), but the bed was extremely comfortable, there was a more than reasonable amount of space, and lots of storage areas. I did find the breakfast selection slightly disappointing (limited egg selection, no low-fat milk etc.). Also, it is taken in the coffee shop next to the basement indoor pool and fitness centre. Consequently, there is a fairly pronounced smell of chlorine. I noticed that there are Club activities on several nights of the week and was concerned that these might prove disturbing. But all events seem to finish by 23:00 and I never noticed a sound! In fact, I loved the peace and quiet of The Residence. But my own preference would be for the internet to be included in the price instead of breakfast. I\u2019d then make the 2-minute walk over to Raffles City where there are several breakfast choices!

Price about $35 SGD less per night at Residence. Royal Plaza had free WIFI and well-stocked free mini-bar; Residence had free buffet breakfast- no free WIFI anywhere (not even in lobby). Agree with most recent reviewers- well located, clean hotel. And yes, the taxi driver did not know where to drop us off, even with the address. The driver tried to drop us off at the Singapore Cricket Club - which also faces the Padang. The residence's front door actually faces Stamford Road, not Connaught Drive. Thanks to other reviewers, we knew that we should not get out at the Singapore Cricket Club. The residence is on the third floor of the Singapore Recreation Club. Therefore, the reception (check in) is on the third floor. You do not need to follow the dress code for the third floor or for the ground floor (street level) or for the breakfast room, which is in the lower basement level. 1. Room: Rooms vary in size. Most rooms facing the Padang have one double bed. Twin rooms are usually facing the street (Stamford Road). Since I was given one double bed room facing the Padang, but had asked for a twin room, the hotel gave us a roll-away bed for my son at no cost. It was very tight but quieter than the twin rooms facing Stamford Road. The room design is unusual. The entry way has the bathroom and closet. The sleeping area is \"sunken,\" accessible by walking down a couple of steps. The bathroom in #319 is frosted glass with pull down shades to give you privacy. Ironing board, kettle, coffee maker and mini fridge are nice touches. The beds, including the rollaway, while not pillow-topped were the most comfortable in our trip through Asia (more comfy than Royal Plaza on Scotts, Peninsula Hong Kong and Kowloon Shangri-la). Asians seem to prefer very firm beds, often rock hard. 2. Location and getting around: Singapore's underground/subway system is efficient, clean, easy to use and very safe. Purchased a two day unlimited pass at City Hall MRT station. The station is across Stamford Road (controlled intersection), about a 5 minute walk from the Residence. Conveniently close MRT stations are important because the heat and humidity can make walking very uncomfortable. The station is attached to Raffles City Mall. You can access Esplanade MRT by walking through Raffles City Mall. You can get to the Singapore Flyer by taking the Circle Line at Esplanade MRT (one stop). At City Hall MTR, you can get to the fabulous Singapore Zoo (with a bus transfer). Staff were very helpful in getting us a taxi to the airport. 3. Noise: No problems. Our room was right across from the reception desk. I kept the air-conditioning fan on to drown out any noise. Our stay was on Wed/Thurs. No matches on the Padang and no parties in the Club- otherwise it may have been noisy. 3. Food: Had breakfast once in hotel. Food just OK but lots of choice. Service was excellent. There are at least two food floors/food courts in Raffles City Mall (lower level and level 3-4) - all kinds of food available. Buy your juices/drinks at 7-Eleven - much cheaper.

It has lost its old world charm as the beautiful veranda overlooking the Padang (field) has now become an enclosed Chinese restaurant. the only place to view the games on the field is a narrow patio reserved more for smokers. Or unless you book a room facing the field. Nevertheless, the hotel itself is small, cosy and the rooms were luxurious enough considering at is it mainly a sports club for members. The best part is its location. It's near good shopping, food, the train station which takes you everywhere, all within walking distance. It's excellent if you're there on business as it's close to the central business district. And if you're a health buff, the gym is prob better equipped than most hotels as it is a sports club. The swimming pool is indoors and there are saunas, even separate ones for females. The price is good value considering it's smack dab in the heart of town. The food is not fantastic but it is so near many good eateries at you probably wouldn't be eating in except for breakfast which was reasonable. If you live the theatre you can't beat The Esplanade which is just across the road. Although it's on the third floor and my room was facing the road and not the field, it was not at all noisy.

We also found the breakfasts were a bit average and the poolside cafe they are servied in felt a bit tired and grubby. That said, the breakfast is included in the rate and you can get fresh fruit, yogurt and freshly cooked eggs every day.

Almost all of what I wrote in my previous review (posted 16th March 2011) still holds true - so I won't repeat myself here. I'm happy to report that the less-than-optimal quality of the coffee at breakfast has been fixed. Guests can now get decent coffee from a self-service espresso machine. My only dislike - charging for Internet access - still applies; I just don't think this is the thing to do for a modern hotel nowadays, and as before, it almost deserves a reduction of my rating to 4 stars. I knew that the free wireless@SG service was available in parts of the hotel and requested a room in this area. I was told that this could not be guaranteed, but on arrival I was happy to find that it worked out just nicely. Thanks! I was surprised that some reviewers complain about the site of the rooms.

Quite frankly, there was no room for an extra bed which The Residence charge a lot of money for. Other issues: The fridge did not work which is appalling given the climate; The safe did not work and had to be fixed; Air conditioning took ages to work its way through even a small room; There are steps from the top part of the room to the bed part which is very dangerous, especially after having a drink when you are out! To attempt to solve this problem,there is a light on the steps which doesn't appear to be able to be turned off which is most annoying if you like darkness when you are trying to sleep.

Our room was not ready at 14:00 and manager of the hotel looked after me and my girlfriend and showed us all facilities. Everything was OK besides mentioning many times what is allowed and what is not allowed in this Recreaction Club. There are some places inside where you cannot be for example in shorts. I completely understand dress etiquette. However there is no need to repeat so many times to just arrived, tired hotel guests that in lobby we have to be properly dressed. Please note that hotel is on third floor and you have to get over there through lobby. We felt strange every time we crossed this lobby later after all those remarks. My advise to managers of this hotel- please do not scare so much guests at the beginning. It is enough to mention 1 time about dress code. Not over 5... Price is adequate to Singapore. And advantages- actually there are more than disadvantages. You can use all the facilities. For some of them you have to pay and for some not. However it is very cheap if you compare to other places in Lion's City. 1 play of bowling only 2 dollars out off pick time. Food in restaurant also cheap. Beer in cafe too. Location is great! You see metro station when you will leave hotel's lobby. 2 minutes and you can reach City Hall Metro Station. Please note you can get this red line directly to the airport with one change( you just cross the other side of platform so very easy). Do not take the taxi- you can save some money. From hotel about 15-20 minutes to Marina Bay Sands by foot. Actually everything is close. Rooms are nice. We got the possibility to check out at 13:00 and take a shower near swimming pool in the evening of course for free. Very good gym! No room service.

Had a flutter on the pokie machines on the first floor and they even offered us free dinner, unfortunately we had already eaten in China Town. Then to top it off there was turn down service and a lovely orchid every night. Staff were attentive, answered and helped with any questions, supplied an adapter so we could charge the camera and let us keep it till we left.

Around 5 minutes we were already able to enjoy our room, a double bed deluxe room with balcony overlooking the Padang field. Our room is not too big, but it is a modern room and very clean.

Esplanade, Merlion Park and many Singapore's historical places are also in walking distance.

To get taxi is also easy since many was passing by in front of the hotel. Just talk to the security at front door and they will help you to get your taxi. Or you can walk cross the street, go to in front of Swissotel Stamford loby and take a cab there since they have a taxi stand there. Not every taxi drivers are familiar with the residence, but you can mention Padang field or War Memorial Park to get you near the hotel, since most of the taxi driver is familiar with them. Just remember, since the residence is located within CBD area, you'll have to pay CBD surcharge in certain times. Tips: 1. Spend your morning with walking / jogging to the Esplanade, Merlion Park and the other historical places near the hotel. 2. Go to food court on Raffles City or Makansutra for abundant food selection around $4-$5 / plate. 3.

Food is not normally expensive in Singapore except when dining in the restaurants of the hotels, however the poolside cafe is the exception to the rule. The food was good, inexpensive and the staff great. Our son in law decided to start eating curries while in Singapore and the chef at the Poolside Cafe made sure he had a different one on the menu each night just to tempt him. My husband & I love visiting Singapore and we would appreciate it if you would all stay someplace else as we intent to stay here again and do not want to share this gem in case we can't get a booking in the future.", "Date": "July 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cA hidden gem for families with good facilities for children\u201d", "Author": "Nicole_and_Ben", "ReviewID": "UR71473303", "Content": "Stayed two nights in July 2010 and we were really surprised by this fantastic place. With two kids (aged 6 and 8), the Residence did all it could to give us a great stay. We got in late after a late flight - so only needed a place to sleep. We had a queen bed and two singles in our room- so it was a bit small, but we could go out on to the terrace once the kids were asleep and this was a great space. The facilities include an underground pool, complete with a small water slide for the kids, a spa and steam rooms. There was also a basic play room for younger children and a full bowling alley - each game was less that $3 for guests. We didn't use the fitness room but did use the poolside cafe, which provided a great buffet breakfast included in the price. Staff were very friendly. One tip - as part of the Singapore Recreation Club the Residence does have a dress standard for men and women - no shorts, wear shirts with collars on weekdays (for men), etc. Best to check with the club before you go. The location is fantastic - it is right in the middle of the F1 track, which literally runs past the front door, and we had the privilege of witnessing some of the rehearsals for the Singapore National Day, which is a massive event held on the Padang - and the Singapore Recreation Club is at one end of the Padang. We would happily stay there again. We couldn't have been in a better spot with a MRT on the doorstep, the Raffles shopping Centre across the road and many sights in the Colonial district within easy walking distance.", "Date": "July 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Macau", "Title": "\u201cExcellent experience\u201d", "Author": "FernandoCg", "ReviewID": "UR68611653", "Content": "what can i say? excellent location (2 mins walk to the green line and red line metro station, 4mins walk to the yellow line metro station. easy to get to any main attractions in Singapore) , perfect serivce, very clean, new furnished modern room with high celling, boardband internet ( $22 SGD, 24 hrs acccumlated, very worth money). the only one disadvantge is safety box cant put in my laptop in inside, except it. i would say perfect !", "Date": "June 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Preston", "Title": "\u201cExcellent stay a stones throw from all the major attractions\u201d", "Author": "nilapatel78", "ReviewID": "UR66721982", "Content": "I stayed for 6 nights and could have easlily stayed more. The residency is located opposite the Raffles City mall and City Hall MRT. This is not actually a hotel, it is a private sports and recreational club which has open up the residency part to the wider public. The reception and other staff memebers are really friendly and eager to help which makes your stay all the more better. The rooms are nicely decorated with ample space for your belongings. The bed was comfy and after sleeping in budget hotels, i had the best 6 nights sleep in a long time. The bathroom is compact, there is not much room to manovre if there were 2 of you in there. The rooms features a LCD tv and mini fridge. The use of the clubs facitilites are also available to you should you wish to use them. Breakfast was included and there is a selection of fruit, cereal, pastries, breads, local cusine and traditional english fry up. More than enough choise and variety. As mentioned in the previous comments, the Residency is in walking distance to the mall, Raffles hotel, Sun Tec city, the Esplanade, the Flyer and the Merlion. You could even walk to Little India and Orchard Road. There are plently of restaurants near by including coffee shops for a quick bite.

The location is fantastic, just opposite of the metro station and an enjoyable walk to most attractions and museums. Very close also to many restaurants and a 7 minutes walk to the CHIJMES complex. Rooms are a bit small but very nice decorated, cosy and (the room that I had) with a very nice view over the Padang and the Singapore business district. We really enjoyed the afternoons in the terrace in front of our room. Service is very good and all the staff very professional and willing to help. Only negative point is the average quality of the breakfast. Another very positive point: the 24-hours internet voucher is accumulative, so when you log out it stops charging you, and it expires after 30 days. I\u2019ve used a 24-hours voucher over my entire stay there. Overall: a very good place to spend a long weekend or even more in Singapore. In terms of value it is a much better deal than the 5 star hotels of the city.", "Date": "April 27, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The Residence At Singapore Recreation Club", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d1588227-Reviews-The_Residence_At_Singapore_Recreation_Club-Singapore.html", "Price": "$190 - $204*", "Address": "<div class=\"wrap_bl wrap\">", "HotelID": "1588227", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/91/07/ad/the-residence-at-singapore.jpg"}}
