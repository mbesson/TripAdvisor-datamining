It was comfortable and clean, which is really all that matters, but there was nothing special about it. Judging from the room alone, it could have been Hilton or the Marriott. There was nothing I found particularly defining about it. I understand that the hotel is around 3 yrs old, and considering it was built next door to the convention center, I believe it was built for mostly business travelers in mind. The pool is just a lap pool with 2 lanes, so not that much room for a leisurely swim. The hot tub was nice but always filled with people. The ladies at the front desk were friendly and helpful. The concierges were also friendly and helpful in person. I did call down and ask for Thai food, and they suggest 2 places. When I looked them up on yelp, one of them had a very low rating from the city board of health!! A quick review of health ratings for the restaurants that they suggest, would make them better equipped to recommend decent, healthy restaurants. The real shocker at the hotel was parking. It is $65 per night!! I asked them if they were going to clean it, Perhaps it should get a bed, a robe and slippers too. Valet understood the shock on my face and was willing to direct me to a close parking lot for half the price, but there is absolutely no need to charge that much for parking.

This kind of spoilt me and made it hard for anything else to follow. Likes: The location for a start, it was two blocks away from Market Street, so made it convenient for shopping, eating, public transport. The hotel was uber modern, room likewise, with big screen HDTV and Keurig coffee maker (albeit faulty), wouldnt make coffee, just hot water for tea, so tea it was. The view from my corner room was stunning.. 180 degreee city views, with floor to ceiling windows, again, stunning... Dislikes: As I look like a remnant from a 70's rock band, I got treated like I shouldnt have been there, staff looked sideways, didnt know whether to speak. Unlike the Mark Hopkins up the road where you are treated like a star. Lots of stuffy people around, black suits, curly wire ear pieces, looking important, with no interaction. Same with the doormen, a bit indifferent, sometimes you get a greeting, sometimes not, most of the time you have to open the door yourself. A real noisy afterwork bar at the end of the lobby. A real big one was you couldnt sleep in after 8am, because the housemaid servicing the rooms around you were in and out of the rooms letting the doors slam closed onto the extended dead bolt bar, to prevent the door shutting, so it was a constant, bang... bang... bang... In the end I just got up. Same for putting your \"do not disturb\" on, the staff would still knock on the door, or ring you up, so no getting an afternoon napp. The checking in/checking out process was uneventful, staff almost mechanical. Dont get me wrong, they werent rude, they were efficient, did their job well, just not particularly welcoming.

Also the westfield mall is also only a 5 min walk away in case you need to get something. The bed and willows were great, so was the shower. I asked for a high floor and got a room on the 23rd. That made for some great views of the SF bay. I did not spend too much time in the room, but the floor to ceiling windows did allot for some eye soothing images. Check in was very smooth. The rate was also reasonable in comparison to the other hotels there. I paid $220 a night before tax. They do charge you $15/day on wi-fi which i think is a joke now a days. On check out i was surprised to find some bogus charges. There was a meal charge for an entire lunch for two or three people on me when i visited the restaurant once and had 2 coffees. There were also some false mini bar charges that i believe resulted from moving some bottles around to place a beverage of my own. In any case, the rep at concierge just had me look the charges over and anything that was not familiar was immediately canceled no questions asked. Elevator was always quick and never had to wait for a lift. The only frustrating issue with my stay had nothing to do with the hotel. There are no cabs in SF. Its nuts. I had to wait 45 minutes for a cab at 7:30 at night on the way to dinner. The street were empty, so it was not a traffic issue. All in all, great stay.

I booked it through Hotwire at a rate of $155.00 per night, and for that price we got a fabulous deal. The Hotwire listing stated \"4.5 Star Hotel, Union Square West, Moscone Center.\" I was pretty sure we would get the InterContinental and we are so glad we did! I used a website called \"Better Bidding\" to help me predict we'd get the InterContinental - so helpful! It was my first experience using Hotwire, and I was expecting to be assigned to a low-level room by a noisy elevator. Upon check-in, we were thrilled to learn we had been upgraded to an 18th floor bay-view room. Our room was spotlessly clean, quiet (with the occasional sound of a fire truck, but it was San Francisco we chose to stay in!), and the double beds were very comfortable. (The sheets and bedding were even more comfortable to me than that of the Ritz-Carlton Half Moon Bay, which was the hotel we went to after our stay here - so kuddos to the InterContinental!) My only wish was for queen beds, not doubles, in the rooms. (The Ritz had doubles, too, by the way.) The location of this hotel met our needs quite well. Since we knew it would be about $50.00 to park a car we did not rent one. I would recommend to all families traveling in San Francisco to not rent a car, not only because of the expense, but it's very stressful to navigate around a busy city like SF with all of the bus lanes, speeding taxi cabs and people. It was a $10.00 cab fare to Pier 33 to do Alcatraz, and about $20.00 to the Exploratorium. We definitely saved money and aggravation by not renting a car. Because of expense, we only dined once at the hotel restaurant and it was for the breakfast buffet. We had met a very nice fellow guest at the pool one evening who gave us his two adult breakfast vouchers he wouldn't be using. Since the hotel breakfast buffet costs $28.00 per adult, this was another huge savings for us and we were so thankful! The cost for each of our children was $18.00 and we enjoyed a delicious buffet with fabulous service - a very special breakfast! On other mornings, we dined at a nearby Denny's, Starbucks and Mel's Diner - all within a block of the hotel. There are many, many restaurants within walking distance of this hotel. We walked to dinner one night at a great seafood restaurant called Anchor and Hope - wonderful food and very different from the seafood we get at home in Atlanta! =) We also dined in the food court of the mall one evening. I am typically NOT a food court fan, but this one was unique and upscale. One evening we were all so exhausted from our day of touring that we used hotel room service for dinner. We had great pasta dinners and the prices were reasonable, considering it was room service. We had taken our own bottled waters to the hotel with us and never consider using a hotel mini-bar. We visited the hotel indoor pool and hot tub a couple of times. It is a smallish, two or three lane pool but served our purposes well as our 9-year-old is a competitive year-round swimmer and needed to keep up with his training. We very much appreciated that the hotel had goggles for loan at the pool - a nice touch of the hotel. We had never stayed in an InterContinental before and were overall thrilled with our choice. I am SO GLAD that we stayed here and not at one of the hotels in the Fisherman's Wharf area. Though the Wharf area is where we spent much of our time, I found the InterContinental to be a quiet, restful place after full day of touring the city. There were very few other children in this business-oriented hotel. Because of this, we never encountered any screaming, ill-behaved children running up and down the hallways of this hotel or playing in elevators as we have in many other \"family-oriented\" hotels in which we've stayed. We were able to have a peaceful, enjoyable stay.

A Starbucks is just around the corner. Be careful walking South-West on Howard as the area gets a bit sketchy after dark. If you stay East of 5th, you should be fine. I used the hotel pool a couple of times and it was a bit short (maybe less than 25 yards) and the temperature was a bit warm for lap swimming. The gym looked pretty new and the spa located on the 6th floor was frequented a lot. The fridge has a tiny spot to keep your food and all of the mini bar items, bottled water etc. are on electronic sensors so be careful unless you want a charge on your bill. If you want the fridge sensors deactivated, it will cost you around $30. Wireless is $14.95/24 hour period but the price per day is less if you purchase the 3- or 5-day package.

Much less expensive places (but still nicely appointed in good locations) have free wireless, at least for priorityclub members, give you a bottle water or two when you check in, upgrade your room when they have availability, and have a decent business center where you can access the internet and do some limited printing. Don't look for any of this at the InterContinental SF. In your room, a bottle of Fiji water will cost you $6; I don't even want to think what they might charge for an ounce of gin from the mini-bar.

It's pricey, especially if you add on the extravagant extras for internet, phone calls and breakfast. And, of course, tax! But in a city which is a magnet for conventions and incentive travel, rates can shoot up and down to match demand. Getting locked into a high advanced purchase (no refund on cancellation) can be a gamble, as these rates can be artificially high - only to drop closer to the date to fill the hotel, so that you end up paying far more than the flexible rate ruling on the arrival day. But that's not unique to this hotel. Staff are friendly and helpful, rooms bright and comfortable. The immediate area is OK but far from the best: you might not want to venture further South of Market when the streets are empty. Powell BART station is only a couple of blocks north, on Market - so transport to and from the airport is easy for those without too much baggage. Powell is also a MUNI station, so you can get around town quite easily. Bloomingdales is in the large shopping mall between the hotel and Market street, and you can walk quite comfortably along Market street to the Embarcadero Ferry Terminal market/shopping/eating area. Walking the other direction the atmosphere deteriorates quickly.

I was located on the 9th floor and the cars was constantly honking their horn on the street outside thru the whole day, the man who brought in the taxis was blowing his whistle, but the worst was the fire trucks. I don\u2019t know if the hotel was located next to the fire station, but the extremely loud sirens woke me up several times both nights during my stay. It also was a bit further to walk than what I had expected. I was under the impression that it was located on Union Square, but in order to get to union square it\u2019s about a 10 minute walk. Not that it\u2019s terribly long to walk for 10 minutes, but there is not much to do right outside the hotel so you must walk a good 5-10 minutes to come to decent bars, restaurants and shops (but then you are in the dead center of it) I also find it surprising that they charge me a quite stiff price for using the internet. We are living in 2012 and in the same way as I don\u2019t expected to be charged extra for the TV, using the water and the electricity, I don\u2019t expect to be charged to use the internet.

The hotel itself is nice in a big convention hotel sort of way. But the communication and remedy of bad situations is not good. We checked in and decided to pay for a club room. The room was small and had only a little window instead of the floor to ceiling windows advertised. We changed rooms to a regular corner room which was spectacular. But there were boxes left from the prior guest on the desk, minibar bottles missing and at 11 PM we discovered that the blackout curtains were not functioning. (not good for an east facing window!). I let management know and the boxes were removed and the curtain fixed at midnight. We barely slept that first night because the mattress felt very lumpy. The next morning I requested that the mattress be changed. They don't have any spare mattresses on this enormous property! So they removed the feather-bed and it was much better. Still, I'd expect excellent rather than mediocre mattresses at an intercontinental. The wifi didn't work, and I called to let the front desk know. There was nothing they could do. When we checked out, we were billed for the minibar and the wifi. There were no notes about our complaints and management did nothing to make it right. I had been talking to my boyfriend earlier, assuming that the hotel would do something (buy us breakfast, apologize, or something) to make things right. He asked whether I was just trying to get something for free. I thought about it and explained that no, what I wanted was the opportunity to leave the hotel thinking good things about it instead of negative ones. When things go wrong, a hotel can make it right with small compensations that don't cost them much if anything. But this hotel did not. Not even having a record of the problems and having to bring up the minibar and internet situation at checkout was disappointing. So overall, I have to give it a poor rating for customer service and internal communication. Too bad they didn't make it right...

As before, every staff member was gracious and attentive whether we were in the lobby (concierge & doormen), the Club Lounge, or the restaurant, Luce. Luce, is an example of what we especially enjoyed on this visit. We had heard it had received a Michelin star for the third year in a row, but we were delighted that the prices were comparable to other restaurants. We kept hearing from guests in the Club Lounge (more about the Club below), that the butter-poached lobster was \u201cfabulous\u201d (two guests had it two nights in a row) as well the John Dory, and other items. During our stay, we savored and can highly recommend the lobster, the John Dory, the diver scallop and abalone appetizer, the sweetbread ravioli and a soup with celeric, apples and coffee ice cream. I\u2019ll write more about Luce under restaurants since it was such a positive experience. The hotel location was great, as always, but it was even more important to be so close to all of the tourist sites and public transportation because of the new, higher taxi costs and because I could get everywhere I needed to go with my sprained foot. We had a terrific corner room with floor to ceiling windows and a great view of the bay, the city, the Bay Bridge, and the New Year's Eve fireworks that were visible down at the end of Howard Street. **Recommendation: stay on a high floor with a better view; the corner rooms are the best. The Club Lounge, an oasis within the hotel, was even better than before. Although the food has always been delicious, it seemed there was increased focus on providing healthier, attractive appetizers that are more in line with the food served in Luce. Along with the assorted veggies and dip and cheese and crackers, there were freshly prepared treats such as tuna tartar along with additional cold items. One night, lobster claws were included. For the hot food, highlights were skewers of fish filets and some with chicken breast: neither had any breading or batter. The assortment was different every evening. Each time we passed through the Club, there was something to eat and beverages to enjoy: breakfast, soup-midday, teatime, evening appetizers and drinks, and then dessert with liquors. **Recommendation: upgrade to the Club for a more memorable, tasty stay. We made some great friendships with other guests and shared travel tips, too. Finally, one of the most important reasons why we stay here is that everyone always welcomes us (and everyone else) and they want to ensure that we have a wonderful, memorable stay.

The concierge was especially helpful and overall, when we checked out, we had nothing but positivity in terms of our view of the hotel experience. This all changed as we checked out, we were informed by the member of staff at the front desk that we had a $70 charge for drinks from the mini-bar. We hadn't consumed any drinks from the mini-bar and disputed this with the member of staff. Additionally, we explained that in fact the day before a different member of staff came to our room to check the mini-bar and found that we had consumed nothing. We suggested that the room be checked as well as the stock, this would confirm nothing had been taken. Eventually, the lady at check out agreed and said they would not charge us any money, we requested a receipt from the hotel showing that no money would be taken and that we owed them nothing. The hotel provided us with the receipt which we currently have in our possession. We recently returned from our trip to San Francisco to discover that in fact the hotel had charged my girlfriend's debit card with the $70 without her consent. We had provided the card at check in which the hotel pre-authorised, as indeed is commonplace at most hotel chains. We had not signed any bill or receipt to confirm it was ok for them to take the money, which indeed we didn't owe them in the first place. Basically, this is at best a very poor mistake, at worst, outright theft and indeed fraud. We have e-mailed the hotel and have yet to receive a reply. My girlfriend has reported the transaction to her bank as fraudulent and we will be helping the bank with their enquiries by providing the receipt from the hotel showing there was no money owed on our account at the time of checking out. This shocking behaviour from the hotel has left us with a sour taste in the mouth after what was a fantastic trip. We're all for paying our own way, however a hotel charging a card without authorisation from the card holder is deplorable - especially as we had not consumed anything from the mini bar.

The place was very quiet--our sleep was never disturbed. The people at the concierge desk were always cheerful and helpful. It was very close to the convention center, which was convenient. This was a combination business/convention and a family trip. We had a couple decent meals in the bar, when we were too exhausted to go out or when it was pouring rain. Drinks cost far too much, but I guess that is true of any hotel bar in San Francisco. We tried saving money by going out into the neighborhood for breakfast but, except for Mel's Diner, the other places were quite expensive. On the last day we got the continental breakfast at the hotel for $18, and it wound up being not only delicious but cheaper than most other places, in part because they did not charge for our son's breakfast, which was very nice. My only complaint is that they charge for wi-fi. For a brand new, state of the art hotel, especially one that already charges so much, wi-fi should not be extra. My one recommendation is that they provide an option of allergy-free shampoos and soaps. They had very high-end toiletries--but these aren't good for people with tree nut allergies.

This is the second time we tried the Intercontinental on Howard Street. The hotel is less elegant and serene than the Mark Hopkins. It is situated in a crowded area by the Convention Center close to the Tenderloin district. The first time we stayed, we were impressed by their friendly front desk and their willingness to accomodate our needs. When we wanted a weekend getaway, we decided to try them again. When we checked in, we were met with an efficient, but unyielding clerk who was unwilling to give us the room and services we needed. I was ready to move to another hotel when Janet, another front desk person, took over. Janet went out of her way to get us a beautiful room similar to the one we had on our previous visit. Her courtesy, efficiency and tact restored our faith in the Intercontinental brand. The service we had this time was comparable to the outstanding service we received at the Amstel, Manila, and Bali Intercontinental; it was top notch! I highly recommend the corner rooms on the higher floors for a panoramic view of the city. The floor to ceiling windows give the rooms a spacious, airy feeling not found in the regular rooms (which are mediocre at best). The buffet breakfasts are quite tasty, but they are not quite as delicious as at the Mark Hopkins! I missed the eggs benedict on Sunday morning! Parking rates here are as exorbitant as at the Mark Hopkins, but here there is a parking lot across the street which is much cheaper, but it has no in and out possibilities at night. We had free parking with our package deal which made things much easier. One advantage of the hotel is that it is around the corner from great shopping and that it is right by the Chieftain, a great Irish pub, should one require a tasty libation or some Irish stew cooked in Guinness! For anyone daring to venture into less desirable neighborhoods near the hotel, there are superb Thai restaurants nearby. This hotel might lack the exclusive and sedate ambience of the Mark Hopkins, but their rates and services are superior if one is lucky enough to get the right person at check-in!", "Date": "October 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay\u201d", "Author": "vanbecky", "ReviewID": "UR119377028", "Content": "We stayed here for two nights in Oct 2011, and had a pleasant hassle-free stay.

Their are many homeless people around the hotel and on the way back to hotel I walked one block too far and tried to cut back to the main street but had to walk through an incredibly sketchy street with drug dealers and junks - this street is about 2-3 minutes from the hotel entrance. Good thing it was during the day. Second of all, the WiFi is 14.95 USD a day. This might be one of my pet peeves but I think that any hotel at this level should have free WiFi included, possibly with a premium paid service. Lastly, the bellman was not very helpful when I asked him where I could get a quick breakfast and return within 40 minutes. He kept insisting I should eat in the hotel, but I did not want to pay 28USD for a quick bite and ended up looking for something else.

For me, they were too soft and I woke up w/a little back ache every morning, but with all the walking we did, I still managed to sleep very well. We used the pool and hot tub all but one night. The pool is nice, but is a lap pool, not a play/splash pool. It would have been nice if there was a play pool, but so be it. If you happen to go while there are lap swimmers, playing is not appreciated. We were able to play some of the time and it worked out well as my girls ended up swimming laps with me the rest of the time -- which they found rather fun! The hot tub was nice after long days of walking! I did use the fitness center twice and it was nice sized with newer equipment, television, towels and water. The concierge (don't remember his name) was nice, but I had done enough of my own research - thanks to TA - to know where I wanted to go for meals, sights, etc. We never ate in the hotel as there was always business people in suits and such at the lobby bar and restaurant.

I said did you get our number, he said I'll take care of it. The same day I check after dinner, it's still on there. Checkout time I go get it taken care of the lady says sarcastically, you moved everything? I'll take care if it after they check the room. I tell her we are from out of town and I'll wait in the lobby for it to be done bc of experience yesterday. She looks annoyed and says I believe you and takes it off. I ask for a receipt she says I cant give u one. I ask for her name, she then prints one and tells me May, like the month. Thinking I'm stupid, the girl working the desk next to her laughs at me and I tell them that's rude. She responds I'm not rude and if you want to talk to my manager she's right there.

This hotel is situated in downtown San Francisco, just down the street from the Moscone Convention Center and about approximately a mile and a half from the Embarcadero Street and many of the piers. This property definitely meets the exceptional international standards the hotel chain sets for itself. The room was well appointed with a flat screen television, and a spacious bathroom and closet. The beds had the pillow top mattresses and extra plush blankets. The rooms also had small electronic safes located in the closet, and a minibar situated within the main dresser. The \"do not disturb\" message was not a door tag, but rather a light which was activated with the light switch inside the room next to the door. This hotel has a full spa located on the 6th floor with smallish indoor pool, and adjacent heated whirlpool. A workout room and locker rooms are also part of the Spa Center. A range of massage services are available, but typically booked solid a few days in advance. The receptionist at the spa desk proved most helpful. The concierge services and front desk personnel were quite professional and willing to go that extra mile for the guest in the name of service. There was also an open air bar in the front lobby as well as a full service restaurant with a somewhat limited bill of fare. Due to the hotel's downtown location, parking is a problem. The only parking available with this hotel is valet parking and it costs $50+ to have your car parked overnight. A taxi or perhaps the BART might be better options for transportation. The only other challenge I had at this hotel was internet connectivity. In room WiFi or LAN connectivity was offered for approximately $14 per 24hr period. While there were two computer terminals in the main lobby that provided free dedicated airline check in and boarding pass printing, any other internet use from those terminals was fee based. In summary, this is a wonderful hotel that is all you might expect from a member of the InterContinental chain. It is long on service and amenities.

There was still a decent view from the corner window, at least, but we were facing away from the city. The bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom was almost as large as some hotel rooms in the city, with a separate tub and shower. The location was excellent, only a block behind the shopping center, which is located on top of the Powell Street BART/MUNI station. There is really no reason to have a car in SF, as almost everything is within walking distance, or at least a short ride away on the MUNI, making their outrageous parking fees irrelevant (and all hotels have absurd fees in the area). I do wish luxury hotels would join all of the much cheaper hotels in offering free wi-fi, but there is free wi-fi a block away inside the shopping mall, so it is not a big deal. I also do not like the mini-fridge sensor, as I prefer to buy my own beverages, rather than the overpriced junk they supply. But none of my complaints are at all unique to this property, all comparable hotel chains run the same scams, since many of their customer are on expense accounts or have limitless budgets.

From the highway the big modern blue building was visible. Every driver knows it as one of the best in San Francisco ! A few weeks in advance of my stay I emailed with the concierge, Mr. Bill Sutton , to ask some information about San Francisco and tours to Alcatraz. He quickly answered all my emails and he was so friendly and helpful, I just couldn\u2019t believe this ! We arrived at the hotel after a 20 minutes taxi ride but we still had to wait for a friend of mine so we did not check in yet. I then went in the mean time to the Concierge Mr. Sutton and he was so friendly he could have been a friend of me. I forgot to book the Alcatraz tickets online so Mr. Sutton did everything he could do to arrange tickets for that day. All Alcatraz tickets were sold out online but he made some calls and we booked a combination of Alcatraz and a city tour in a bus/truck . Thanks to the concierge, Mr. Sutton it was a great trip that day ! We checked in at around 2PM at the Ambassador check in on the right with Timothy. He was also friendly and gave us a room on the highest floor, the 33th floor. We actually booked a room with part points / paid so I was surprised we got a room such high. We got free internet as ambassador members but otherwise it would be very expensive. We went to the elevator and actually then noticed we had the top floor but the button did not work from the 33th floor but then we noticed a card reader and then it worked ! It was quite funny, a full elevator for the 6th, 11th, 24th floor and we got out on the 33th floor. Our room was surprisely very big and modern ! We had probably a suite. We entered in the living area with a desk, sofa, small dining table, big TV, a toilet with sink and a closet with safe. Then we moved on to the bedroom which was also great and beautiful ! There was a big bed, big TV and a closet with an umbrella and bathrobes. There was also a massive bathroom with big bath, rain shower, toilet, again a TV, 2 mirrors and many towels. This is I guess the only hotel I stayed in with really soft towels ! We had also a FANTASTIC view over San Francisco and even the Golden Gate Bridge ! There were 2 separate air conditioning system but one was doing a bit strange. Even after 10 minutes I found it a great hotel ! I got then a phone call from housekeeping and the reception if the room was okay, and sure it was ! They also delivered a bottle of water and fruits / nuts. The next day the lady from housekeeping was doing our room when we came back from Union Square and also she was extremely friendly and helpful ! The hotel is ideally located on 888 Howard street with many restaurants and shops in the neighborhood. Behind the hotel is the Westfield Mall with Bloomingdales and other shops ! Union Square and Macy\u2019s is only 5 minutes walking, just like the Cable car which is very close at the hotel. Also the F-line tram is just around the corner of the hotel. At the end we checked out with JD and was also very friendly ! All staff members were extremely friendly, the Concierge, Mr. Sutton is an example for everyone ! Probably the best hotel in San Francisco or even California ! Location, Service and Staff were fantastic ! Next time I will stay here again !

I'd always perceived the IC as generic, professional, and a tad boring - though in reality this also translates to a reliable, pleasant and comfortable choice. If you're after a cool vibe, strong and edgy decor, something quirky and unique to San Francisco, the IC will disappoint as too safe and bland a choice. If you're after comfortable rooms with a pleasant, modern decor in a very central location, with a spa, gym, indoor pool and jacuzzi, pleasant looking bar, separate restaurant, all accompanied by friendly and courteous service, you can't go wrong with the InterContinental San Francisco. (And unlike the sister property you don't have to scale hills to get there). The hotel has a corporate feel; being adjacent to the Moscone, I imagine it would be an excellent place to stay for business, meetings and conferences. The front office seemed to cope well with the high volume of guests when I was checking out, but the bellman's team seemed overstretched - the desk was unmanned and there were several full luggage trolleys in the lobby being attended to. Despite the rush, the team did notice me standing at the desk and I was attended to in a sensible amount of time. Having my own agenda, I didn't interact with the Concierge but I know the IC as a company pride themselves on their concierge service.

This last time was only OK... not up to the Intercontinental's normal standards.\u201d", "Author": "RobandJohn", "ReviewID": "UR115057868", "Content": "We stayed at the Intercontinental San Francisco for a fifth time at the end of June. It had become our hotel of choice in San Francisco following several years of staying primarily at the W Hotel and the Marriott (which is now the Marriott Marquis) while on trips to The City. This was the 5th time in about a 2+ year period that we stayed at this particular Intercontinental and we travel to SF about 3 times a year. A few things this time may change the way we look at the Intercontinental San Francisco. First, we'd booked months in advance and had secured a deluxe room like we always do. The hotel has standard rooms, superior rooms (floors 14 to 24) and then so-called deluxe rooms (floors 25 to 30). What we ended up getting was a room unlike any we'd had before at this hotel... and not in a good way. We still got a high floor, but it was one near the end of the hallway that had a connecting door to another room. It was a much smaller room than we normally receive when we book this same type of room. There wasn't a single thing mentioned from the woman who handled our check-in at the front desk (i.e. \"Your room type isn't available so we are putting you in a smaller room\" or an apology or anything). When we went to check out, we looked at our bill and the room cost WAS reduced from the price we booked... so at least they did that. But some notification beforehand would have been the right thing for them to do, especially for someone who's stayed at their hotel numerous times recently. Equally bad, it was the first time at the Intercontinental we heard conversations coming from the people in the room next to us. It was obvious there were 2 parents and 2 kids in the room next door to ours. At one point, the adjoining room door was opened on the other side and you could hear LOUD giggling and laughing, plus the door on our side was visibly shaking like a big wind gust went through. It was beyond annoying. I guess as a kid it might seem like a funny thing to do, but it was off-putting at a 5-star hotel. One reason we stopped staying at the W in San Francisco was because of its thin walls, and it looks like we may have to do the same at the Intercontinental and look for another hotel. Some noise in the halls is fine and normal at any hotel, but you shouldn't be able to hear word-for-word conversations from the people in the room next to you. (Again, since it was the first time we'd ever noticed it at this hotel, maybe it was solely because of the adjoining room door.) A few times staying here, they've had town car service available to the airport, which is convenient and only a few bucks more than a cab. It wasn't available this time when we left but we never had problems finding cabs just outside the hotel. And there are many places to walk nearby (world class shopping, restaurants are all in easy walking distance). Avoid going towards Sixth and Seventh streets though because it can be a bit of a dicey crowd, particularly late night. We walked back to the hotel from Union Square after midnight Saturday night and it was fine. It may be a long walk for some, but it was enjoyable to us because we like to walk and explore San Francisco. The hotel does have some very nice employees who are friendly and helpful. Some of the valet guys are cool and talkative. If you're expecting great views of the city from your room, you won't get it by facing south towards the ball park. It's a pretty average view, even for San Francisco. The view towards Market Street is much better and we've had that view 2 times during our stays. One last thing... we're the type who don't really care if our room is made up or not, so we keep the lighted \"Do Not Disturb\" button turned on in the hallway. We checked in on Saturday at 3 p.m.... and had the \"Do Not Disturb\" light turned on Sunday afternoon about the same time. We got a note put under our door that said, \"We are respecting your wishes.\" That wasn't too annoying... but then we received a phone call from a man who said, \"Hello this is Security calling. We're calling to make sure everything is alright in there.\" OK, that was weird and a bit scary. It didn't sound authentic at all. We said everything was fine... but then we called downstairs to the front desk to ask if that was a legitimate phone call. The woman at the front desk said she didn't know... but then she checked and called back and said, \"Yes, security called to make sure everything was OK.\" That is just plain weird. If you turn your \"Do Not Disturb\" light on, should it really warrant a note under your door PLUS a phone call from security? We were trying to take a light nap after hearing all the noise from that family in the room next door to ours, yet we still got disturbed by hotel staff.

There is an electronically wired minibar fridge in the room which will immediately bill you for minibar charges as soon as you touched any item within it. We had bad experiences with this sort of minibar in previous hotels (We had to repeatedly go down to the main desk to report that we had merely \"touched\" the bottles, not drunk them, to get their charges reversed), so we did not even DARE to open this minibar fridge!!! We had buffet breakfast included in our rate but the breakfast was just average. Breakfast was not typical of a 5 star hotel. There were very little choices. There was not even an omelette and fried/poached eggs station. (Our breakfast experience at other 5 star establishments were better, with better choices, and usually a manned omelette station). To make matters worse, after we got home, we found out that we were only awarded 2000 priority club points for our stay, instead of 10 points per dollar spent.

The hotel is very modern, clean and comfortable. The rooms were quiet, and we were even upgraded to a high-floor with a nice view over the city. The hotel seems to have a rep as a business hotel, which meant we could get a really good rate over the weekend. We've been to San Francisco many times before, and so we knew the area and chose the hotel specifically so we'd be near to Market St, Union Sq and the downtown shopping area. The location was great for us, and the hotel also seemed to be popular with Giants fans as the ballpark isn't far either. The staff at the hotel were friendly, especially the porter who seemed to take a liking to us. Our only issue was with arranging a taxi to the airport through the hotel - it failed to show up at the time we'd requested, and it was only then that they decided to tell us that the taxi companies had been unreliable when ordering larger vehicles (there was 5 of us). We waited for 20 minutes, but in the end decided to take the hotel limo - and couldn't help wondering if that had been their plan all along... Anyway, it wasn't too much different in price between all of us, and we gave them the benefit of the doubt. We had access to the club lounge in our room rate, and that was great for coffee and a croissant for (free) breakfast. The lobby bar seemed to be nice too, although we never stopped by for a drink - despite being given a free drink coupon that we never used. Compared to the other IC property in town - the Mark Hopkins - this is the better option. The Mark Hopkins has the history, and a more desirable address; but once you're inside the IC has larger more comfortable rooms, better facilities, feels more spacious and airy, and is more generous with their Priority Club upgrades.", "Date": "June 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NEW PLYMOUTH", "Title": "\u201cGreat Club lounge and we will return\u201d", "Author": "SHOMUR", "ReviewID": "UR111367499", "Content": "We stayed there from 6-10th May 2011.

I have back problems so I was looking for a short and safe walk. The last time we went down for a game we stayed the Hyatt Regency on the Embarcadero . Just as a side note, we had a fine stay there and the walk to the park along the water is a nice one. However, the Hyatt was booked. The Intercontinental has a package deal which includes parking and breakfast at a very reasonable rate . Rates and room location I suspect depend upon what the convention activity is like at the nearby Moscone Center. I thing we booked on a slow week. We were given a corner room which provided a really nice open feel to the room . The bathroom is huge with it's own floor to ceiling window . I looked in one of the regular rooms and it was the same as the corner room with the exception of the extra window space. Nice gym . Indoor lap pool. Oh yes, great beds. The walk to the Giants' game was less than a mile . Believe me , the cab hassle after a game is so overwhelming you'll appreciate being able to walk to your hotel. Can't get over how much the neighborhood has changed. We went to a day game , but would have no problem making the walk at night. Not only has the area really become very pleasant there are plenty of people leaving the park after a game so there's a real safe feeling. Hotel staff was great. Only one real complaint--- we had guests join us for breakfast once during our three day stay. Since our deal included free breakfast I had no idea what the cost of the buffet style meal was. My friends ordered two espressos with their brunch and the tab was roughly 95 bucks. The buffet was fine ( okay there was a fruit fly problem on the pastry, but that didn't bother me as much as it did my wife) , but certainly not worth that kind of money.My fault for not asking . Overall I really enjoyed the place. FYI for baseball fans there is a ''W'' hotel a tad closer to the park and the Saint Regis is also nearby .

I had a little incident where i lost a box of items that was delivered to the room, and special thanks to Ms Zusanna (i believe was the assistant director of front desk, apologies if i spelt your name wrongly), who more than made up for it with her excellent customer service.

If you decide to take an airport shuttle from SFO the InterContinental is certainly one of the first hotels the shuttle will stop due to its location close to the highway from the airport. My first impressions were ok. The entrance is not very impressive, simple but elegant. Check-In was swift, but I got downgraded. I had originally booked an Executive Room on one of the top floors. They were not very apologetic about it and it was a little bit like: \"as a matter of fact we downgraded you\" To give them credit, they did agree to refund about $25 per night and I still had all the privileges of an Executive room such as Club InterContinental access and free Wi-Fi. BTW, the Club was great, the staff there were super friendly and even greeted me by first name. The breakfast is great and the afternoon tea there was also very good. After a long flight from Europe I was not in the mood to argue about the downgrade so I just accepted their offer. I went to my room and after about 10 minutes a cleaning lady entered the room. She did knock on the door but only for about 2 seconds before she opened the door. Good thing she didn't enter the room 2 minutes later since I was planning to take a shower! I do think that they should pay more attention to those little details. She obviously wasn't aware of the fact that someone was already in the room and wanted to bring a bathrobe which was missing. Apart from that, housekeeping was great, the room was 100% clean and the HDTV was just stunning, as stunning as my view. Unfortunately I did not see the Golden Gate bridge but AT&T park at night was nice enough. With the exception of the staff at the InterContinental Club I did not have much interaction with the staff, but everyone seemed nice enough. The location is good, not great though. It is a 15 minutes walk to Union Square and about 10 minutes to Market Street. The Embarcadero/Ferry Bulding is about 30 minutes away. One last thing I have to add: Upon check-out I had to explain (again) that I do not have to pay for the Internet fees ($60 for 4 days are OUTRAGEOUS) and I don't like to \"beg\" for things which were already agreed upon.

The mini bar was OK with pretty standard contents and fairly hefty pricing. One of those autocharge ones - so don't touch anything unless you really want to use it.

The exciting find was the evening meal - in the evening the restaurant turns into the Michelin starred 'Luce' - absolutely AMAZING and not ridiculously expensive if you choose carefully - I had an astounding starter, delicious entree and lovely glass of wine beautifully presented for about $50 - with the added amusement of sitting listening to a rather aggressive headhunter positively bully her clearly exceptionally well qualified client over dinner at the adjacent table - worth every penny - so perhaps not the best place for a discreet dinner.

When I reported the bugs and requested a room change, they gave me an apology and literally swept it under the rug. I really wanted to be respectful and not make a big deal out of it but now that I reflect on my actions, I should have thrown a fit so that they would have given me more respect. To be honest, all I really wanted was a nice human gesture by the hotel to make me feel better. I mean I was so terrified, I couldn't sleep at all and sat up the entire night in my new room. I wish they would have told me that they were doing everything in their power to address the issue because it's so prevalent today. Instead, they moved me into a new room (downgraded me by the way, I mean they could have ran out of rooms but also didn't tell me), didn't help me check if there were bed bugs in the new room or even ask if I was okay or comfortable, and sent a security guard to question me on the \"incident,\" as if it was some kind of accident report. The one thing the concierge did ask me was, and I quote, \"Do you want your laundry done as well because when this usually happens, we offer this service but since you're leaving tomorrow, I don't think we can get it to you in time.\" I do understand that it was my last night, but I had asked them to return my laundry by 4pm which was not particularly early but they were unwillingly to budge on the time that they could deliver the clothes (6pm). I mean really, 2 hrs? I bet they could have pulled some strings to help me feel better about not taking home any critters with me!!! On top of that, when she said \"usually,\" it made me really wonder if they've implemented any kind of protocol to remove these critters from the rooms. I really expected more from a 4 star hotel. Thankfully, I didn't get bitten the first two nights I was there. After that experience, I don't think I want to stay at any hotel again but even more so stay at any Intercontinental hotels.

I had no problem since my office pays for it, but if you are on a personal trip, this could cost you a bit. The location is good (please note: I did not use any public transportation, nor did I drive a car, hence my impression is based on travelling by cab and walking to nearby places) Union Square is at walk-able distance. Walking to Union Square, spending time there and doing a bit of shopping was a good way to spend my evenings after meetings etc. I found the restaurant and in-room dining to be expensive. Quality of food was good, but value is questionable. The bath room had only a shower area, no bath tub. I usually like to relax in the bath tub after a hectic day, I could not do that here. In-room mini bar is a rip off. Only about 10cmX10cm space is available for the guest to use. The rest of the space is filled with bottles with much higher than market rate price tags. Coffee maker was complicated to operate, I messed it up on the first day. To be fair, one of the housekeeping people explained to me in a very friendly manner how to operate it.

Easy walk to Moscone Center, food, trolley, shopping, union square. Short cab ride to Fisherman's Wharf. I give low marks for value only because the rates are very high - although to be fair - no higher than any other hotel in town during a busy conference. The HVAC was a little louder than expected, but tolerable. The only other thing I would probably change is the spa. Spa was just ok. The thing that stood out is the waiting area wasn't as relaxing as I have experienced at other places. The constant opening/closing of the door made it hard to relax. Suggest they change the doors to something less noisy. Also, there was a bit of upselling of the spa products. After 5 days of walking/talking during the conference, I very much needed to relax!

I asked the receptionist if I could be put in a room that was as quiet as possible. She obliged, putting me on the 28th floor but added that \"some guests still find it a bit noisy even up there\". I didn't think much of this since I figured not much noise could make it up 28 floors. Unfortunately, I figured wrong. Even 28 floors up, it was like being back in a college dormitory with a party going on next door. To make things worse, the band was playing terrible covers.

I love the city and I love love InterContinental San Francisco highly recommend. My only niggle was the mini bar stuff is stupidly expensive and it's all automatic so DONT MOVE ANYTHING!!! Also internet is not free and telephone calls are mad expensive! I think for a modern hotel there should be free WiFi...lesser hotels offer it! The niggles did not affect my stay but I needed to highlight them to offer a balance view, I would return to San Fran and this hotel in a heartbeat!!!!

Much is made of Tenderloin and upon checking in we were told that it's best to avoid venturing west of 5th Street. Even though nothing happened the walk back at night past Mission was not particularly pleasant. Better to walk down 4th than 5th from our experience. - I know that American hotels have soft beds but these were a joke.

The hotel's also excellently placed for local bars/microbreweries, restaurants and shopping - just around the corner from the Westfield centre. We were in a club room on the 33rd floor; the room was spacious and had fantastic views over the bay. The bathroom had an excellent shower and Aromatherapy Associates toiletries - luxurious, but the lavender and ylang-ylang shower gel was a tad over powering for day-time use! The room gave us access to the club lounge with free wifi, a couple of PCs and a printer and a steady supply of food and drink on tap; we subsequently discovered from some of my husband's colleagues our room actually worked out a lot cheaper than booking at the regular rate and then paying for internet access and getting breakfast in the restaurant downstairs. I was advised on booking that continental breakfast would be available in the club lounge and was expecting a few manky looking croissants and some coffee (obviously too used to British/European continental breakfast) but the food was amazing: a selection of cold meats and fish (including Gravadlax), fruit, loads of different breads and pastries, preserves, bacon and scrambled eggs. We missed afternoon tea every day but took advantage of the cocktails, wine, champagne,beer and (delicious) hors d'oeuvre that were available from about 5 o'clock. There was also cake, cookies and digestifs laid out after dinner. I only had 2 criticisms of our stay; firstly, the staff could have been slightly more attentive - we basically had to work everything out for ourselves; and secondly the tomato based tasting menu at Luce, whilst delicious, was miserly to the point we had to go to the club room and fill up on cookies and was probably the only disappointing meal we ate whilst in San Francisco.

On this trip, we booked the Intercontinental Hotel located at 888 Howard Street. About a week before our arrival, I called to see if a couple of my requests could be accommodated. My first request was an early check in. I knew our flight was scheduled to land at 1:30 and since their check in time is 3:00, I was hoping they would let us check in about 2:00 \u2013 2:30. I was told by the representative that this would not be a problem and she would note my reservation. My second reason for calling wasn\u2019t exactly a request; it was more of a question. While in San Francisco, we were meeting up with a few friends and celebrating an anniversary. We wanted to ship their gift directly to the hotel and not have to worry about it on the plane. I was told exactly how to address the package and that it would be placed in my room when it arrived. I was extremely happy and had a great feeling about this trip. On Saturday, our flight was pretty uneventful except for our flight having to circle the San Francisco airport for about 20 minutes waiting for clearance to land. We retrieved our bag and hopped in a taxi to be taken to our hotel. We arrived at the hotel approximately 2:30 and we were tired. We stood in line for about 5 minutes waiting to check in. We were then told our room was not ready, needless to say we were frustrated. I asked how much longer and was told it would be at least an hour (which is after the 3:00 check in time). To be fair, the woman did offer to downgrade us from the King Deluxe (which we booked) to a standard queen room (which was available right at the moment). No thank you. We booked the room we wanted, we weren\u2019t about to accept a downgrade for a week just to get into our room. Perhaps if an upgrade was offered, we would have accepted and paid the difference. Since our early check in request was not honored, I confirmed that there was a note on our reservation that we were expecting a package, I was assured there was a note and the package would be delivered to our room. We asked if our bags could be held, we were starving and didn\u2019t want to take our luggage with us. We were told to give the bags to the bellman, so we did and we left. Fast forward a few hours. We arrived back at the hotel about 5:30, thoroughly exhausted by this point. We checked into our room without incident, handed over our luggage tag and were told our bags would be delivered to our room promptly. We got to our room (on the 25th floor) and we were very happy with everything, very clean and modern. About 5 minutes later, there was a knock at the door and it was the bellman there to deliver our luggage. Unfortunately, it was not our luggage. The guy argued with us for a second, but seriously, why would we refuse our bags? He left, and about 25 minutes went by and he finally came back with our bags. I was thankful to finally have everything and hoped that would be the end of the \u201cincidents\u201d. Everything was going perfect with our stay. We were sleeping well, the hotel was quiet, and the staff always seemed pleasant. On Tuesday, our package was supposed to be delivered. My husband had met up with a few friends earlier in the morning for a bike ride, so I was in the room alone when I received a call from the concierge that a package was delivered. I asked if they would bring it up and was informed that I needed to go down to get it. Okay, fine. I went to the concierge desk and the woman gave me a little bit of a problem because the package was shipped in my husband\u2019s name. I informed her that the hotel reservation was also under my husband\u2019s name, but that mine was also listed under the room. She finally relinquished and asked me to \u201csign this sheet accepting the package\u201d. I did so, but then realized I wasn\u2019t signed only for the package, but also for an $11 package handling fee. I was outraged; we had never been informed of such a fee. When I asked her about it, she informed me that it was a standard fee. I informed her that I had called in advance of shipping the package and was never made aware of this fee. Had I been made aware, I never would have shipped it to the hotel. She didn\u2019t really want to listen to me. I told her for $11, the least they could have done was bring it to the room for me. Honestly, I don\u2019t know how they get away with charging this fee. UPS delivers the package; they call the guest, the guest then have to get the package. Wow, expensive $11 phone call. :-( When my husband returned, I informed him of the charge and he was as annoyed as I was. He went to the front desk and got it removed. Other thoughts on the hotel and the area: \u2022 I thought $14.95 internet charge was a little excessive, but we paid it. \u2022 I was happy that they offered a place to check in for your flights and print boarding passes. \u2022 \u201cThe Green Door\u201d, which is a medical marijuana dispensary is across the street from the hotel. Often times the smell is pretty strong when walking by. \u2022 \u201cBuca di Beppo\u201d a fresh, authentic Italian food served family style, for parties of two or two-hundred is also across the street from the hotel. This came in handy on nights we didn\u2019t want to go too far away. \u2022 There seemed to be a lot more homeless people around the SoMa area.

The hotel is beautiful and the hotel bar had great pork sliders (had them for dinner twice in three days). I usually don't eat at hotel restaurants, but made an exception on this trip because we had good food at the Sheraton we stayed in before we came to San Francisco. I'm glad we tried the hotel bar-as I was too tired at night to go exploring to see what other food options were near by. There was a Bucca De Peppi (sp?) across the street, but I'm not big on food chains--I'd rather eat local. The room condition was good--but at night we could definitely hear the calls for the taxi to pick up other guests--especially the last night when there was a whistle. While the location was good, a block closer to Union Square would have been perfect. I liked Union Square a lot as a base and the hotel was close to the Cable Cars and bus (recommend the 3-day bus pass). The concierge were great! They recommended good places in China Town, Italian area, and I'm glad we were able to walk everywhere and take the bus/cable cars. The hotel was very clean but had some quirks--with the double bed, the person nearest to the shower can't sleep when someone else is in the shower because of the light reflection--but the rooms were overall very nice. I'd recommend to others traveling in the area--as long as they walked towards Union Square and not away. All in all, I'm happy I booked this hotel especially for the hotwire rate I got and I'm so glad we didn't stay in Fisherman's Warf. My only real San Francisco complaint was that it was so fogged in we didn't get to see the Golden Gate Bridge--which would have been cool to see.

We also felt paying for the Club level was well worth it as the Club offers a free breakfast, free appetizers and drinks in the afternoon and free internet access (you have to pay a $15 daily fee to use the internet in your room). The gym is adequate with a few treadmills, machines and an indoor pool. No locker room or health club type amenities. If you want to be right on top of fisherman's wharf or other trendy areas of San Francisco, I would not recommend this hotel. If you are looking for some exercise and really an easy way to see all the city has to offer by walking through the city, I would recommend this hotel to you.", "Date": "July 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "CSquaredC2", "Title": "\u201cGreat modern, sleek hotel in a perfect location...\u201d", "Author": "CSquaredC2", "ReviewID": "UR70149814", "Content": "Stayed here on a Friday night while we were in town to watch a couple of baseball games and chill.

The only problem I had with this hotel is the the hostile reception staff, which I thought was sub-standard customer service especially from Intercontinental.

Well things happen especially with technology and it could be understood if only SOMEONE - ANYONE from the hotel would have kindly explained what was going on. There was absolutely 0 communication from the hotel staff to the guests as to the internet problem. When you called the front desk - and if you were lucky enough to have someone answer - you would get a \"wait 15 minutes\" and try again.. After 48 hours, decided this wasn't going to work. The hotel uses an outside contractor for a \"help desk\" and this service was at least available and friendly although they couldn't fix the problem. The whole issue was the overall lack of communication - even after 24, 36, 48 hours from the hotel staff to the guests (a simple letter to each room?). Enough about the internet.. I am an Intercontinental Ambassador member in the Priority Club - the highest level of membership. Each time I used the phone (front desk, room service, etc) they repeatedly referred to me by the WRONG last name. Each time I would correct the person on the phone and they would mumble something about the \"computer being wrong\".. OK 1 time I get it.. but EVERY time I called during a 3 night stay and they NEVER got my last name correct.. come on. Finally if you have a front-facing room (Howard St.) you will hear fire sirens at all hours of the night as apparently the local firehouse is right down the street. My room was on the 17th floor and the sirens were incessant and always very late at night. To be fair.. on the last night after the internet was finally working, the hotel front desk did call me to advise and they also sent a very nice bottle of wine and cheese tray to my room complimentary.

In a hotel that is relatively brand new and serves mostly business and convention attendees? Absolutely unacceptable that I was not able to work in my room at the end of the day. Room was not all that clean -- there were stains by the toilet and not all dirty towels were replaced the next day. Went to iron my shirt only to realize it had rusty water in it that stained my shirt. In a budget hotel, this would not bother me, but for a worldclass hotel this is unacceptable. To cap it all off, I ordered room service my last night. First call was put on hold for 5 minutes. I hung up.

Location was amazing!!! Just a few quick minutes walk to shopping heaven and the cable cars! Upon check in you felt like a valued guest. We were staying in a Club suite which allowed us access to the Club Intercon. If you want a great experience, make sure you book the 'Club level' option it takes your stay to another level. The Club Intercon is located on Level 6 and the accompanying suites are high up, however due to a fear of heights they relocated us to level 10, which still had lovely views over SF. Club Intercon gives you: > Breakfast - don't expect a full buffet, but you will find scrambled eggs and bacon/toast ; fruit and cheeses; cereal and juices; pastries; tea and coffee. More than enough. >Complimentary drinks bar 5:30pm to say 7:30pm - Fabulous, before dinner you can enjoy a drink and some great canapes, watch some TV, read a magazine or chat with the staff, special mention to Luis who is just fabulous and very friendly. >Supper nightcap - Call in after dinner for a Baileys on the rocks - great touch. >Best part - Business centre - free internet access, to check your emails, print off documents and plan other parts of your holiday/business trip. The staff of the Intercon SF are helpful, friendly and very professional. Concierge recommended some great restaurants which were fantastic. The rooms were incredibly clean and housekeeping were courteous and happy. The ONLY downside was the valet parking cost US $60 was outrageous. If you are not a guest of the hotel , fine, but 3 days of valet parking hurt. US $25-30 is appropriate. You can park at a big carpark around the corner, but it didn't look safe and as we had a rental car we felt it was safer with the hotel. So in summary: Plus+ *Very luxurious, modern and clean *Great staff, efficient, courteous and professional *Great location, close to Shops and walking distance to Union Square *Rooms great size and comfy beds and pillows, the topper was like sleeping on a cloud. *Club Intercontinental - Amazing can't rave enough, takes your stay to another level. Minuses - *Valet parking - very expensive *Noise - be warned SF is a big city and this hotel is located in the heart of it, you will hear sirens often, 1 night in particular must have been busy as the sirens woke us on a number of occasions, nothing to do with the hotel though, but it did impact on our sleep a little. Perhaps the higher you are the less noise you hear. In Summary a really great hotel, it was a pleasure to return to this hotel everyday after a long day of sightseeing and shopping.

We had been left a lovely touch in the room of a complimentary bottle of prosecco complete with a card as we were on honeymoon which was very much appreciated and went down extremely well after our 16hr travels. This level of service and thoughfullness should not have been a surprise as it had already been displayed when i was trying to source a hire car before i travelled and got excellent advice and service from Bill Sutton through e-mails and on our 2nd day we were helped so kindly again by William Hall as i had forgot to print my Alcatraz tickets and realised we would need loads if ID to pick up tickets at pier so William allowed us to e-mail him conformation which he could then print. Staff on arrival and departure each evening were also very welcoming. The room was lovely, fresh and spacious and really liked the wall to ceiling windows and the i-pod docking station. One of the main reasons i chose the hotel was due to its newness as i dont like old and tired hotels. We used the pool every morning and was pleasantly surprised how quiet it was, on the first 2 mornings we had the place to ourselves which was a bonus and the gym looked good too although never used There were a few negative things about our stay though which were the intimidating walk to the hotel in the evenings, the overall average room rate, the lack of a bath tub, the expensive wi-fi and not being able to have any fridge space in mini bar. I had read reviews before going saying that the area is a bit shady at night, we made the mistake of stopping off one evening when returning at a liquor store on 5th street for a bottle of wine and i felt quite intimidated by people inside and outside so we did a bit of powerwalking back to hotel, maybe a tourist mistake but you dont want to be looking over your shoulder on holiday. Since we were moving around the States on our honeymoon (8 different hotels/motels) the room rate was the 2nd highest we paid and didnt even include a breakfast and only 4th/5th nicest out of 8, maybe a san francisco thing, we found santa monica the same in terms of value for money. The lack of bath didnt bother me but my new wife was looking fwd to a good soak after our travels and so was disappointed. The wi-fi charge is expensive and again whilst comparing to other hotels (2 motels didnt have) we stayed at this was the only hotel that didnt offer free wi-fi (albeit others lose charge in resort fee) which was disapointing as for 2 travellers with i-phones the wi-fi is a great way to research places to go and restaraunts during your stay. The mini bar was all tagged electronically so couldnt remove items and replace with bottled water / wine etc which was also disappointing although there were ice buckets.

The stations are 2 blocks away from the hotel. 2. i don't really get the internet charges either $15 per day. Most hotels now offer this as a free service. Staying at intercontinental means you are willing to drain 200-300 bucks per night, so 15 bucks is nothing. NO... as someone who travels often, I think internet should be free. You're really going to lose numerous potential 200-300 a pop clients over to oh I don't know, maybe the four seasons for 15 bucks? 3. service was great. i didn't need much. easy check in, clean room, friendly faces. which during my stay, i got all and then some. my entire stay was for 3 nights, but every time i left the building or came back, the receptionists smiled, the housekeepers asked me how i was doing, and the doorman got the door. what more could you ask for? 4. during my stay, the pool was unavailable due to construction, but i look forward to using the pool when i am back in town in august. i've looked at other ihg hotels (such as mark hopkins, and holiday inn on van ness), and to tell you the truth, i rather stay at intercontinental. maybe the only exceptions would be the W hotel or the 4 seasons. 5. i seriously wonder about the negative experience one may have at this particular hotel. may i ask if it may have been your attitude? Treat others like how you would like to be treated. Kindness is a two way street folks. Yes, it is the hotel staff's job to be accomodating and provide a positive service but they too are human.

It is exceptionally clean, well appointed and comfortable. My wife and I stayed here for two days in two different rooms. We were on floor 25 on one day and on floor 28 on another. The upper rooms are an 'upgrade' and you should try to get these rooms if at all possible. The only real differences we saw were a free bottle of water and a chocolate bar on the desk and a much more confortable bed. The hotel is pretty high tech and eco friendly (this being San Francisco eco friendly is important). Neat eco friendly items: energy efficient light bulbs in all outlets (but not the dim slow to warm up kind...these you couldn't even tell were any different), a special eco setting on the heat/AC that allows you to engage a sensor and if it knows there's no movement in the room it will cycle down the energy use of the heater/AC unit, and what was really cool, an electronic system to notify housekeeping of whether you want to make up the room or not be disturbed....no more of those silly door cards that drop....you just punch the button in your room and it illuminates a light outside). There are some neat amenities like iPod docking station, comfy soft robes and even a bathroom scale. The bath towels are very large and soft....bigger than any hotel towels I've seen in the last decade or so. The room has a huge, excellent flat screen HDTV with plenty of free and PPV options. There is an in room fridge stocks with the typically overpriced drinks and snacks. There's a free coffee maker (Keurig) that brews one cup at a time in a very mess free system. It is located just two blocks from 5th and Market Street which offers a large number of public transit options, including four different rail lines from that location (BART, Muni, Streetcar and Cablecars). You can easily get here from the Airport on BART and only have to walk about two blocks. (The BART fare is only $8.10....a bargain compared to a taxi). It's also easy at that intersection to jump a cable car to Fisherman's Whart ($5 one way) or hop on the street cars ($2) which can take you down Market and down the Embarcadero to eventually end up at the Wharf. But if you want to drive, there is valet options and two self parking lots just one block away ($35/day). It has a good restaurant with an award winning chef and a nice lobby bar. Now some drawbacks.....there's no free internet. It's $14 a day. And, the busienss center charges for everything except printing boarding passes (which are free). The pool is the narrowist I've ever seen. But it is long and ideal for lap swimmers. There are two lanes and if you swin for fitness, you'll love it. If you have kids who want to have fun....it's not that great. The hot tub is nice, though. Public gathering spaces are not abundant immediately inside the lobby. The hotel does have two larger gathering spaces, but they are upstairs and you have to take the elevator. Not a big deal but you can't just loiter easily in the front of the hotel unless you want to sit over the concierges (who are all very, very friendly.....they were great in helping us figure out places to go). The other issue is that the location is just a bit outside of the really active area of SF. If you want to be right in the middle of the action, this might be a few blocks past your confort level, but if you want to be close by without the ruckus....this spot is ideal. But I was most impressed with the overall cleanliness. The hotel still felt brand spanking new.

When we returned to check in that evening, the person checking us in knew nothing about it. So we had to argue for a bit, and wait until that person could contact the person who had checked us in. My wife was more annoyed than I, as she would not have agreed to check in later without getting a substantial return for it, being tired from the trip.

That said, I'd rate my 6-day stay at IC SF as my most memorable experience at any hotel ever. It started with an email message from the guest service manager (Shehani) a day prior to my arrival asking me to the exact time I will arrive. When arriving, I was checked in by Shenani, and was taken to my room by her together with the front desk manager (Juan Pablo, JP). The hotel was sold out, and I was upgraded to the Bay Suite, that occupies the entire east corner of the hotel on the 32nd floor. Fantastic views of the bay and the bay bridge. That was the beginning of a fabulous stay with unmatched service and unmatched personal attention. Let me mention some of the highlights: first, every afternoon I got some food assortment to my suite. Then, I found the club to be a great one: high quality breakfast, food service during the entire day, long hours until 10:30 p.m., perfect. The swimming pool is for lap swimming. In one of the days I hosted a business meeting/party for 20 people in the club, and the event went through as smoothly as it could. I was in constant touch with Shehani and JP and the two obviously \"conspired\" to ensure that my stay exceeds my (high) expectations. On my last day I felt compelled to write to the GM of the hotel (Peter Kohler, he manages the two Intercontinentals in town. A handwritten personal message from him greeted me in my room on the first day) about this unique experience. So, my last hours at the hotel were spent with him and with an executive in the company that own the hotel. I used almost every service the hotel had to offer: concierge (Bill was great. He even remembered my name after my first communication with him), bellman, valet parking, instant service and on and on. perfect score to all (the instant service is not always instant, but with 550 rooms that is unavoidable). Finally, on the last day I was allowed to check out at 7 p.m. around 8 p.m. I sat at the lobby and waited for my shuttle to the airport. spotted by Shehani who was concerned that I am leaving the hotel with an inadequate amount of food-to-go; so she prepared a few sandwiched for me for the way.

I got a corner king room on 24th floor with view facing west and north. Staff is generally very helpful although there were some rough edges due to high volume of guests - it took three tries to get feather products removed from my bed, and when they did finally come it took them 30 minutes to remove the feathers because of all the products and it required two people but they did not charge for this service. Ate breakfast in the lobby and had trouble getting decent service, again due to high volume of customers. I complained to a manager that this was not Denny's and given the prices we should have better service - I got an apology and some of my breakfast comped. Hotel wifi is excellent although the regular wifi service is spotty in the lobby. But the service in my room is great and it makes sense because there is an access point in the closet. Bathroom is very up to date with a decent tub for soaking, although it is not separate from the shower. Plenty of large plush towels and robes that I can actually wear. Climate control is also excellent and bed is comfortable even without the feather top mattress which I asked them to remove. Foam pillows are very tall and a bit uncomfortable to sleep on - they did not loft down like a feather pillow, but also I was not sneezing either. Extra blankets are wool which is very nice because I had the feather comforter taken away. The wool blankets were plenty warm. Front desk and business office serve are also excellent - I had help sending a fax and scanning a document as well as printing a document, although they do charge a significant rate for this. Parking is expensive (all over the area actually) so I did not keep a car at the hotel but instead took BART to other areas in the Bay area. BART station is a 5 minute walk from hotel which is fine if it is not raining. Hotel is also near the theaters so I went to see a Broadway show one night. This was an unexpected added convenience. Hotel is right next to the convention center and very convenient for conferences. Minibar is very well stocked although not cheap it is very convenient.

At best, I would say that it is inconsistent. The bell desk, valet parking, housekeeping, and restaurant staff were all very pleasant and helpful. The front desk staff, however, were largely unhelpful, slow, and in at least one instance, unprofessional. Check in took longer than usual, as the person checking us in had to consult with her supervisor on multiple occasions to ask what seemed to be fairly routine questions. We were using a \"buy one, get one weekend night free\" certificate (from IC's Ambassador program), and the supervisor actually complained out loud about how customers with these certificates never give the hotel any advance notice about using them. She actually voiced this complaint to our faces. I thought that was highly unprofessional, especially since that is how the \"buy one, get one\" program is supposed to work: customers are not asked to provide advance notice about using the certificates. In the end, even though we had originally booked a room rate that was supposed to include breakfast, the supervisor informed us that we would not be getting breakfast on the second day because we were using the free certificate. Although I can understand the logic behind this policy, the information was conveyed to us in a rather unpleasant and haughty manner by the supervisor, which left a bad taste in my mouth. Check out also took longer than usual. Even though there were only three people in line, it ended up taking nearly 15 minutes for the front desk staff (two different people from the check-in pair) to get to us. Without making eye contact, the front-desk agent mumbled an apology about the wait. Not a big deal, but another illustration of the amateurish level of service -- and probable lack of adequate training -- in some of the front-desk staff. The hotel itself is quite shiny and bright. The rooms, as others have mentioned, were spotless and relatively spacious, with nice views over the city. The bathrooms are large, with a separate shower and tub. The location is very convenient to Union Square and the Moscone Convention Center, although the tradeoff is that you are farther away from the more classically \"San Franciscan\" neighborhoods such as Nob Hill, North Beach, and Russian Hill. (For a first-time visitor to the city, I would recommend one of the Fisherman's Wharf or Nob Hill hotels over this location, but for a repeat visitor, this location is just fine.) The breakfast buffet in the main restaurant is excellent, with a well-prepared array of dishes. The gym is also well-equipped and spacious.

Not going to rave too much about the hotel room, except to say that we had an excellent stay. We enjoyed the complimentary breakfasts every morning, they were great full buffet and filling up on their breakfast meant we could often skip lunch as we would rather be sight seeing than eating out somewhere. The staff at breakfast were very polite and they really great to talk to for advice (ask a local). One night on returning late to the hotel (10pm) we had skipped dinner due to our Alcatraz tour and were starving for food. Unfortunately the restaurant was about to close so we couldn't dine there but they did let us order the full restaurant menu and eat it in the bar area. This suited us perfectly as we weren't really suitably dressed for the restaurant and really wanted something to eat as quick as possible so we could return to our room. The food we were served was fantastic and was washed down with a couple of local beers from the bar. We were looking to stay at the Westin St Francis but was very happy with the deal we got here, the WSF had no specials on at the time of our stay and was over twice the price we paid here.

We took advantage of the California Staycation package they were offering and got the room, breakfast for two, free valet parking and a $25 gas certificate for under $200 a night. Not only that but on seeing that we were Intercontinental Ambassador Gold members they upgraded us to an executive room. WOW!!! What a room. Floor to ceiling windows and views of the Bay and/or the city. The people at the front desk and all around the hotel were some of the best people I've ever encountered. Friendly, complimentary, accommodating, patient and helpful. Man, I'm starting to sound like I work for the hotel or something. Haha. On check in they valeted our car which thankfully we didn't have to pay for because $60 a day is a bit *um* out of control. They then let us basically choose our room since we were entitled to an upgrade as a Gold Ambassador, the place was a bit empty due to Thanksgiving, and we picked the Executive. It was one of the best if not the best hotel rooms we have ever stayed in. Topped by possibly only the $1200 a night bungaloes we stayed in at the Intercontinental Thalasso Bora Bora. But for the money, this was insane nice. The grappa bar is intriguing and while I'm part Italian that may be the first and only time I ever try grappa. Hello, turpentine. Long story short we decided to return for a special occasion in March when we had tickets to the SF Ballet at the gorgeous War Memorial Opera House. Fantastic show and highly recommended. Yes, the ballet. No, I'm not Billy Elliot. We returned to the ISF and it was just as good as the time before. We weren't able to upgrade to an Executive :( but we did get a room pretty high up with amazing view of the Bay. Seriously, could they have built this hotel ANY BETTER???? No. It's almost perfect. We had a great weekend stay and once again the service was impeccable. So after such great success last Thanksgiving the parents are flying in from North Carolina and we're going to have a family Thanksgiving in San Francisco for 2009.

Our suite was clean with a great view of the city and the buffet breakfast was pleasantly better than expected. Unfortunately we don't have the same to say about the online booking. The ICH site was running an online promotion at the time: 1 free night for each 2 nights qualifying stay booked within the promotional period (our booking dates and stay was within the specified period). We immediately booked our 5 night stay as there was no indication our booking did not otherwise qualify. We paid $199 per night + taxes for a King Suite that included a complimentary breakfast. We thought it was a good deal considering we would get 1 free night for each 2 nights stay. This was our deciding factor for not booking elsewhere for at least $50 less per night at a comparable hotel like the Hilton.

What really irked us was finding out the original invoice and record of our stay had been modified/deleted from our online account. The online record now only shows the dates we stayed and comment \"Non-qualifying nights stay\". Our invoice with extra charges we paid room service is nowhere to be found. We feel we were mislead by a deceptive marketing tactic that did not make clear that our stay did not qualify upfront.

This manager ( we didn\u2019t see her name.. ) , a Japanese lady brought us to view 2 other rooms on the 32 and the 33 floor.

It's centrally located a few blocks off Market Street and Powell where the Cable Car Terminal is located. Very close to the hotel you can take public transportation to visit any part of the city, including the BART train to the airport which costs $8.20 and takes 30 minutes to get you there. We purchased the 3-day pass for public transportation and got more than our money's worth. If you\u2019re an active person and enjoy walking, you are within walking distance of Union Square, Chinatown and the main shopping district. We\u2019re in our fifties and had no problem walking to Chinatown from the hotel, but I understand that may not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea since you must walk a little over a mile or so to get there, plus all the walking after you get there. Just take bus #30 or 45 about two or three blocks from the hotel and you\u2019ll be in Chinatown in a few minutes. Tourist lines to ride the cable cars are long, so we rode them a couple of times and then stuck to the buses and trains. You can also hop on the cable car at a stop other than the terminals and not have to wait as long. I'd rather share tips with readers on how to save money, so I'll just tell you that the rooms, lounges, spa and restaurant at this hotel are all excellent. The property is beautiful and pretty new and the service is top notch. The concierge desk staff is friendly and extremely helpful and so is the rest of the staff. During our stay, the world famous FC Barcelona Soccer Club and its multi-millionaire star players were staying there and hundreds of fans were lined up outside day and night, but management, security and the staff made it very comfortable for the guests so the spectacle became fun to watch after all. If you're driving, forget paying the $50 daily valet parking fee at the hotel and park two short city blocks away around the corner on 5th St and Mission for $28-30 overnight. We walked late at night from this parking lot to the hotel and never felt unsafe. Take usual precautions and use common sense as you would in any major city. We rented a car the last two days of our stay because we were traveling to other places in California and that\u2019s what I recommend if you\u2019re in a similar situation because parking is expensive and you can forget about on-street parking at most places. Besides, you don't really need a car to get around in San Francisco. Save money on breakfast by walking one block past the parking lot to a corner caf\u00e9 on 5th St and Jesse (about 3 blocks from the hotel and across the old US Mint House) where you can buy a delicious breakfast for about $7 and they make it for you right then and there when you order it. They also serve fresh fruit juices and many other goodies. Sorry, I can\u2019t remember the name of the place, but is on the corner of 5th St and Jesse after you pass the Pickwick Hotel on the same sidewalk. Across the street and diagonal from this caf\u00e9 is another location named Latte Express where you can buy fresh donuts and coffee, but no bacon and eggs or hot dishes. These two little places will save you a bunch of money if you\u2019re a breakfast eater and don\u2019t want to pay $15 to $20 per person for a very similar breakfast at the hotel restaurant.

Over 2,000 miles of riding the rails was an amazing experience, but when the train came to it's final stop in. EMY, we had to organize places to stay; awaiting our impending road trip south along the coastline of California. Please note, these hotels were booked months in advanced, therefore the rates were very reasonable for the hotels which were chosen for this vacation, therefore; can not confirm that these great rates would accompany the walk-in rates. To begin this adventure, we needed to stay in San Francisco, as the train arrived across the bay in Emeryville at about 5:00PM leaving very tired passengers looking to get refreshed after 4 days on the train. Once again, I was put in charge of choosing the accomidations and the room which would be used on this vacation. Among tons of speculation and excitement in my household, I did the quoting for the Intercontinental San Francisco among other hotels. This one, of course, came out on top citing a good location (close to the train station, the in- and out-bound highways), the Intercontinental Brand (being one of luxury and excellence), and the various traveller reviews and photos of the property. The rate was secured, the room was booked. We had some difficulty booking online through the Intercontinental website so a quick call to the provided 1-800 number fixed all that. My sleuthing had discovered that they were offering various rooms at various prices (of course), but one had stuck out from all the rest. The hotel was offering us accomidation for us in a \"2 Queen Bedroom Suite\". The room was only supposed to be filled by 2 adult patrons, but with that call to the 1-800 number, they pulled some strings and placed us in the room with 2 adults and 1 child. The room promised wall to ceiling windows, two queen beds (with plush beds, pillows and whatnot), large business desk, oversized bathroom, and much more. Everything that anyone would want in a room, for both personal and business travelers. Now, enough about talking about what the room was supposed to look like, let's get into the experience. What it was really like, well folks... it was absolutely fantastic! Would I go so far as to say that it was my favorite hotel, no. That title still holds true to the Hotel Indigo in Amhurst, New York (for reasons which I will go more in-depth later). The hotel itself. A sparkling glimmer of blue upon the horizon of the smog infested city. The location on Howard Street is the perfect place, just off of the major highway connecting the city to Oakland and the Airport, a very convenient spot. The hotel itself, as you have probably noted from the pictures is bright blue with the tinted floor to ceiling windows. The hotel is 33 stories tall, and impossible to miss from anywhere. Upon arrival, we were greeted with very friendly valet staff and the hotel's porter. They offered to take our luggage and park the rental car in the compound downstairs. Now, this is where I will begin to sway from the positive. Before booking the hotel, the agent warned us that there would be a parking charge, and it would be steep as it was in downtown San Francisco. The porter informed us that the total charge for one night's parking under the hotel would be $49.00 before taxes and fees. Yes, is correct: $49.00 PER NIGHT, PER VEHICLE. It's not like you have any choice as per where to park, but watch out. You may be better to take the limousine service to/from wherever you are going, but please be warned. Also notable, California charges you a PARKING tax. So it worked out that parking was about $58.00. Wow, not a good start. The parking issue was quickly accepted, as we trudged into the lobby at around 6:00 PM that night. As we walked upto the check-in counter, we were waiting for service for about 2 minutes while the desk was busy with another customer. Shortly after that 2 minute time, another member of the desk staff arrived to process our arrival. He welcomed us to the hotel, and provided us with the upsell of the Intercontinental Ambassador club. Now, I wasn't paying, and the $150 may be a bit steep, but once I hit the age of majority, I will probably join up the Ambassador plan. If it helps out with my Prioroty Club account, it'll be done for sure. We were given our keys (the jet black 'Intercontinental' card) and we were sent to the 7th floor. I was a little disappointed with the floor, I would have liked to be higher up, to see more out the windows, but the porter (who followed us up with our bags to our room) described that they place the higher floor rooms for those who are staying for longer periods of time. Though on again I wasn't impressed, it was alright, there was nothing really to look at that late at night. We were lead to our room, bags in tow. The key opened the door, and it was like an aura of blinding light subsided to produce our amazing, beautiful, and most of all awesome 2 Queen Suite. The room was deep (see pictures) featuring a long hallway connecting the door to the bathroom and the bedroom. The room was decorated much like the lobby, with modern looking furniture, a 40' or so TV affixed to the wall, the two plush and white beds, the oversized business desk, the sliding door to reveal the bathroom. WOW! It was all so much, this hotel room was absolutely amazing. Upon entering, I was really able to take a look up close at the features of the room. The TV, an LG 40', the beds with a 2 or 3' feather bed add-on and fluffy comforter, the wall to ceiling windows looking out onto Howard St. It was all amazing! To go a little more in depth to the accomidation, I would like to start with the entry hallway and entryway. Entering into the room featured quite an extensive hallway connecting the doorway to the room. The area was a little dull, but what followed the entryway quickly made up for it. Due to the hotel being so new, they are able to add in many different features which would come with newer buildings. What I am leading upto would be the electronic controls featuring \"Do Not Disturb\" and \"Make Up Room\" which both do exactly as they say,but in a way which require no effort on the part of the guest. Great innovation! Also included here was the closet featuring automatic lights (turning on when the door opens and off when the door closes), an in-room safe which they say is large enough to hold a laptop (I don't know about that...), and of course extra pillows and blankets. I, of course, opted to take all the pillows which I could find for myself (6 in total which were available throughout the room (without taking the parent's). Moving into the main room, you are introduced to a vast space of all that is Intercontinental. On the left of our room there was the TV and underneath was a table or dresser featuring the mini-bar and storage dresser (complete with coffee machine using Tassimo technology). On it's reverse side were the two Queen beds. We were very lucky to get the ability to secure this room, they were very large (for a Queen), immensely comfortable (feather bed topping made the bed so soft), and came complete with 5 pillows each. The whole package equaled an unparalled sleeping experience later that evening, I haven't slept that well for a very long time (in a hotel, that is). Beside the beds lied the oversized business desk. The desk featured a very new Nortel phone featuring colour screen describing all of the room features and welcoming us to the room (of course with the name of the guests)! Last but not least, the bathroom. Oh the bathroom! Featuring your standard fixings (as required by law xD), they brought the bar up a notch. The shower, spacing the entire width of the room, glassed in with an oversized glass door and specialty shower head was truely a delight to use after using a cramped shower/toilet combination on the Amtrak train over the past 4 days! Settings set to: \"Rain\", \"Massage\", and \"Pulse\" were great to get back to that crisp and clean feeling I had come to miss over the past few days. The bathroom also featured a completely separate bathtub on the opposite side of the room. The ammenities were first class, imported from the Czech Republic by some company. As usual, they were the usual fixings, but were oh so good! Everything was great, the night's sleep was great in the most comfortable bed on earth and made the night pass by very quickly. Unfortunately, the hotel stay had to come to an end, so it was time to check-out and head down to the next stop on our journey this evening. The next morning, and early rise was accompanied by the bill collection. The room was the same great rate as was advertised, the only kicker was the parking. $49.00, plus the California State \"Parking Tax\", and some other stupid charge which brought it up to the high 50's. Otherwise, there weren't really any other surprises, leaving us happy campers! My final statement, falling behind the Hotel Indigo in Amhurst, New York; the Intercontinental San Francisco takes 2nd place on my list of favorite accomidations. The hotel is stunning, brand new, and is full of everything you would ever want and need. If you get a chance to stay in SF, you MUST stay here, you won't be disappointed! All this raving about the place and it only gets 2nd place, you ask? Well, San Francisco stacks up as the city I will NEVER visit again. The location is near Union Sq. which is also full of people panhandling, bothering you every few seconds, and then occastionally trying to steal your wallet and belongings (lovely experience, really... chasing off some idiot nearly reaching into my pocket.) SF was just not a good place to be, if you don't have to go, don't. If you have small children, stay even farther away. You wouldn't want to scare them away from the Big City atmosphere. Try somewhere else like Chicago, there you will give them a more warm approach to the big city! I hope this review helped you choose your accomidations!", "Date": "August 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane", "Title": "\u201cRecommended\u2026\u2026we had a great stay\u201d", "Author": "gaz_61", "ReviewID": "UR38930333", "Content": "Recommended\u2026\u2026we had a really great stay at the Intercontinental with no problems, our room/suite was fantastic.

There was a room length window seat in the living area that my GF loved. The view was awesome. The hald bayh also had a window opposite the sink. The room was immaculate - minus a bird poop smear on the exterior top of the living room window. We left the room for a bit and returned to find that complimentary champagne had been delivered while we were out. Sweet! We never used the trolley tickets. However, I did want to point out that we receive pre-printed tickets at check-in. Someone else here posted that they were only reimbursed for the cost of these. This was not the case with us. After dinner we hung out with friends until well past 2AM. When we returned to the hotel, the valet section appeared to be full. There was a slight communication problem with the attendant (he was nice but did not speak English very well) as we were trying to explain that we had prepaid parking. He was trying to send us over to another deck that was cheaper to save us money. He finally saw my valet tag on my keychain, apologized for the misunderstanding (I think), and took our car. A bit of a snafu, but it wasn't too big a deal. The breakfast buffet was relatively high end food and delicious. Yogurt in a martini glass, anyone? We left the next morning. Our room came in less than the estimated price on their site (by $10). Valet was a bit slow - but friendly. We drive out of the city for a couple of hours and I realize that I left my camera in the room (I had been taking pictures of the room before we left). I immediately called and was connected to Gloria in housekeeping. She assured me that they found the camera and could ship it to our next destination. I wound up having to call two days later (due to spotty cell service in yosemite) and she remembered me, playfully scolded me for not calling the day before, and promised to send the camera to my home.

The shopping can not be faulted - but the resturants within stumbling distance are limited in this area - you need to catch the bus or tram up to other areas of the city to get a better choice. On arrival (taxi around $40 from SFO) we were not greeted by a bell boy and carried our own luggage in to reception (and to the room as we were not offered help). We checked in without hassle - except for the receptionist trying to sell us an upgrade to some chargeable loyalty scheme (not meeted with great joy after 15 hours travelling!).

This to me is a great sign of a hotel who has taken note of that 'special requests' box on the internet booking site and it was really appreciated. Despite this being a lovely gesture - there was a thorn in the roses - the rose petals and desert left overs were left in the room for the next 3 nights - leaving rotting food and petals laying about.

The rooms have large windows (floor to ceiling), but there really isn't much to look at directly by the hotel. Perhaps a room on a higher floor would be worth seeking out if you want views of the city. Service and Amenities: The hotel staff was friendly and polite. I didn't make much use of the staff, but my interactions with them were pleasant. One glaring annoyance is that there is not free internet in the hotel. I realize other chains often charge as well, but this hotel doesn't even offer free internet in the lobby. There is a Starbuck's around the corner you can use for WiFi.

Value: Both times I booked through Hotwire, so I did not make a deliberate choice to stay here. Based on prices quoted on the web site, Expedia, etc., this hotel is overpriced. If you really want to stay in Union Square, then you will end up paying for it, but even so, there are less expensive hotels of similar quality in the area. I usually try to avoid this area of town because it is packed with shopping tourists, but for both of these trips, it was really convenient. Also, when booking on Hotwire, I try to stick with neighborhoods I know. P.S. Restaurant: I was very excited to try the restaurant, since the chef was recently recognized as best new chef in Esquire, but I was really disappointed. The service was the highlight. Food and wine were served promptly by informed waitstaff. The decor in the restaurant is pretty cheesy (an attempt at chic 1970s retro, perhaps?)

I would expect that a seasonal tasting menu would not include things like New Zealand scallops and out-of-season strawberries (in June), especially in San Francisco.

We were there to celebrate his birthday with a romantic get-away. Before I booked, I spent several hours looking at various hotel options in San Francisco. The Intercontinental seemed to be interesting and we were not disappointed. They offered a great deal which included a buffet breakfast each morning, free parking and daily cable car passes. We specifically paid the extra to get a corner room and it was well worth it. Our room was on the 23rd floor and faced the bay side. The corner rooms offer two walls of floor to ceiling windows. Because the Intercontinental is a few blocks from the heart of downtown San Francisco, the view is not blocked by other large buildings. You do not have a view of the next building, but instead you look out over a city that is even more beautiful at night. We slept with the view fully unveiled each night. The bed was wonderful and plush. A large flat screen TV was a nice touch. The swimming pool was under emergency repair and I was disappointed at first, but honestly we never had time to use it any way. As the breakfast buffet was included with our package deal, we enjoyed it each morning. I would not have paid $28 each otherwise because there are lots of simpler options at local coffee shops. The service provided by each hotel representative was wonderful. I read in other reviews that the service was spotty, but that was not our experience. Everyone we encountered was gracious and helpful. I indicated we were celebrating my husband\u2019s birthday and they surprised him with a great birthday cake. We enjoyed the treat and he felt special. The hotel is conveniently locate. It is not lumped in with all the other downtown hotels but not too far off the beaten path. You can take the BART from the Airport if you are able to walk a couple of blocks to the hotel. Both the cable car and public buses are easily accessible from the hotel and we were able to cover the city. Bloomy\u2019s and Neiman Marcus are close if you like shopping. The Chieftain Irish Pub is right across the street and we took advantage of that more than once. All in all, we were very happy with our overall experience and are glad we swung for the room upgrade.

I asked for foam pillows and that was not a problem, the staff was very accommodating. It was also a handicap accessible room, so there was no soaking tub but the bathroom was very large. I would recommend to anyone staying here that when you are headed towards Market St that you use either 4th or 5th, as 6th tends to be a bit more dodgy.

I liked the location and the design, and the staff are certainly well-trained and service-oriented.

My king room on the 18th floor looked west towards downtown and was very quiet. Bathroom was very nice and had a walk-in, tiled shower. Most nights (but not all) I got turndown service. A major annoyance was the unadjustable desk chair. It sat way too low and couldn't be raised, an ergonomic problem if you needed to work at the desk.

The bohemian regentrification of warehouses, nightspots, residential hotels, art spaces, loft apartments, furniture showrooms, and the infamous Folsom BDSM zone can be sketchy in some blocks, especially around 6th & Mission.

Also, I would call ahead for my car, but they never had my car ready. I started to think calling ahead was useless, and that they don't actually get your car for you until you go downstairs and request it. The rooms were amazing. I had a corner room and the exterior walls were all windows. The furniture and carpets are new and the beds are comfy. Not only do the rooms have flat screen TVs, but they have HD programming! I was so excited about this. Many hotels nowadays have the flat screen TVs, but IMO that is useless unless you actually provide the HD channels to go with it. The TVs were also a good size, my guess is 46\". I ordered room service a few times. It was a little pricey, but I thought the food was pretty good. Definitely better than most hotels.

Parking in SF does not come cheap, so these rates can be expected in the area. Lastly, the location is great .. especially for shopping.

It does have a range of \"modern hotel problems\", however. I was upgraded to a nice, high-floor corner room due to my Ambassador Club status. Hotel was pretty empty, despite a major convention at Moscone Center (a block away). Rooms are tastefully appointed, clean and comfortable. A/C system is particularly good, very quiet. However, when I first checked in, I was warned that a \"maintenance issue\" would require the hotel electricity to be turned off for an hour that afternoon. Fair enough. But during the late night hours, while I was working (phone and internet), the power again went out along with all communications - AND THE ELEVATORS. No warning at all. This pattern of electrical service continued for the next day as well. Apparently still-unresolved construction issues. The phones go down because of a too-small UPS system specified. My other \"modern hotel\" pet peeve is the showers. Part of luxury hotel life is a good, powerful hot shower. Instead this hotel has barely enough water pressure to get wet. If this is due to some kind of \"green initiative\", I object. If this is just due to bad water-saving shower heads, it should be fixed. Midline management was dismissive of the concerns I raised.

My boyfriend and I booked it on hotwire for $140 including all taxes ($119 before taxes). It was listed as Union Square East, which is not really accurate since it's in SOMA, but it was still in an area that was nice enough. We live here so the homeless don't surprise us, but if you're coming from a non-urban area anywhere in SF is going to have that problem. If it had been located one block south or west it would not be in a good location, but it was right inside what we consider to be the border of the upscale area downtown. We got there early in the day and left our bags with the bellhop. I lost my ticket when we came back, but he was able to retrieve them with my driver's license, which was a relief. Everyone was so polite we were sort of taken aback. Check in took only a few minutes, and we explained why we were there when asked. We got booked into a queen size room on the 14th floor (1405 I belive). When we got to the room I was very disappointed with the size. It couldn't have fit a king size bed had someone put it in there. The bathroom was even more disappointing as it didn't have a bathtub and I really wanted to soak my feet after walking around all day. I went downstairs and asked if it would be possible to be moved to a room with a bathtub. His response was \"It's your anniversary, of course you can!\" which was a relief. We got moved to the 9th floor to a king size room. It was about twice the size and had a separate shower and bath. That changed it from a 2-3 star to a five star experience. We took advantage of the jacuzzi and swimming pool twice in less than 24 hours. Both were such great temperatures and the jacuzzi was big enough that even when an entire family came in there was plenty of room. The TV was huge and we almost rented a movie but decided against it. Most cost between 10-14 dollars, and include those that are in between theatre and DVD. Bed was a little soft for my taste, but my boyfriend loved it. The blankets were plush and wonderful.

I don't care if food is overpriced if I am in for a satisfying gastronomic experience, but the food there was absolutely nothing special. There are many fabulous restaurants in the city, so give those a try. Also, when we consulted one of the concierges there for a good sushi place, he directed us to a really crappy downtown joint. He kept emphasizing how \"reasonable\" it was. I guess because we look young (we're in our 20s) he thought we would only want cheap.

I have had the pleasure at staying at all three of Mobil-rated five-star hotels in San Francisco and wanted to try something different this time around. I gave the hotel five-stars in consideration of the how much I paid for the room and all the amenities I received. If I paid, say $300 or $400 for the room only, I would have gave the hotel three stars. I wanted to share some of my tips for staying at this particular hotel. For California residents, IC offers a \u201cStaycation\u201d package which is inclusive of valet parking ($46 + tax per night), buffet breakfast for two including gratuities and taxes (otherwise, $25 per person) and a $10 credit to your guest folio. I HIGHLY recommend this package to California residents. You have to find the package on the hotel\u2019s website under the \u201cExperience More\u201d tab and book from there. I was given a rate of $159 for a Standard room\u2014this rate is the same as their \u201cBest Available Rate\u201d which is normally reserved for the room only. Since this hotel is buried within the city, there are really no \u201cviews\u201d to speak of. There are only different vantage points depending on what floor you are staying on. I believe the hotel goes up to the 33rd floor? I recommend booking the room with the most appealing rate and asking for an upgrade at check-in (whether it is gratis or you pay a small \u201cupgrade\u201d fee). Keep in mind you need to add 14% accommodations tax (this is the \u201csales tax\u201d) to your room rate. This hotel has a club lounge and here are my thoughts about it. Generally when you book a room with Club Access (for two people), you will be on the 31-33rd floor and it will be about $100 more than a comparable room. If you want Club Access and want to save some money\u2026when you check-in (if the option is available) the supplement is $80 (for two people)- you save $20. The caveat is you could be on any one of the 33 floors of the hotel. The club lounge is open from 6:30 AM to 10:30 PM. Unless you\u2019re staying on a corporate account, this option really does not seem worth it to me. Can two people really eat $80 worth of food? Each additional guest is $40. I would much rather pay $100 for club access if it were the Ritz-Carlton (this option is available at the Ritz San Francisco). Club access affords you food presentations throughout the day, internet access WITHIN the club lounge, and various reading materials and possibly garment pressing (not sure). Other reviewers have mentioned the amenities in the room so I will forgo my usual review and give a synopsis of little quirky things about the hotel. Check-in is at 3 o clock PM and check-out is Noon. Your room is fully equipped with an automated mini-bar (similar to Las Vegas) and it will charge you when you remove something almost instantly (even if you put it back). A Snickers bar costs $6.50. A small coke costs $4.00. When you order room service, you are automatically accessed a $3 delivery surcharge, 18% gratuity, and local sales tax (8.5%). The hotel offers a complimentary shoe shine. Housekeeping did not turn down the room (so no bottled water available although Evian is available for $8). Make sure you make a reservation for breakfast if you receive a breakfast coupon as there was a wait at 9 in the morning. Although that time is generally when people eat breakfast anyways, I normally never have to make reservations because a table is usually available. I tried to check-in at 8 in the morning but no room was available. When I came back at 12, the helpful front desk agent was able to put me in a room then. I did not look at the fitness or pool facilities so I have no comment. When I was checking-out I tried to contact the Bell Desk to have someone help take my luggage downstairs to no success. Each time, the line was busy. My car was brought up in 5 minutes. Overall, if I gauged what I paid for the room and the amenities I received, it was a GREAT DEAL. If I could procure the same rate again, I would definitely jump at the chance. I would not pay more than $250 for the Standard room I stayed in.", "Date": "November 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cModern sleek new intercontinental San Francisco\u201d", "Author": "Hossein5", "ReviewID": "UR21975719", "Content": "This is a beautiful brand new hotel very close to the convention center.

The package includes free parking, a $20 gas card, and breakfast for 2 at their restaurant in addition to the room.

We decided to do the upgrade since we were feeling peckish and were pretty certain we could get our money's worth in free drinks and snacks at the lounge. As it turned out at checkout they did not have a gas card to give us, so they gave us the room upgrade for free instead -- OK by us. The hotel is very modern looking, quite striking really. The check in was pretty quick and efficient and we found our way to our room easily enough. We were on the 32nd floor, and found the floor-to-ceiling windows a great touch. The room however was a bit on the small side, and the bath was one of the smallest we've had at an ICH property that we've ever stayed at. Still, it was very clean and comfortable with great bedding (as usual). The lounge is the smallest we've experienced, too, at any ICH property, although there is a big outdoor area so when it's not cold or raining one could escape the slight clausterphobia of the indoors by sitting out on the patio. Being on a higher floor ended up being slightly annoying, at least when it came to the elevators. Even though there are 4 of them, it seemed that whichever elevator came up to get us would also be the one to stop on each floor going down along the way. We learned to not take the first elevator that would come up, so that we could avoid stopping literally 5-10 times on our way down to the lounge or the lobby. It's a very nice property, despite previous posters if you know SF it's a good location.

The hotel was only a month old and is only a few blocks away from my work so I'd seen the building during it's entire construction process. On the outside it looks very hip and modern. On the inside, it's just as cool and hip. The hotel is beautiful and many aspects of it are top notch. As a San Francisco resident, I like to stay at hotels in the city for leisure and to spend \"just the two of us\" time with my boyfriend. I must say that this is hands down one of my favorite hotels in San Francisco. It has a completely different angle of luxury than other high end hotel establishments in the city; it's very laid back, welcoming, friendly and not pretentious. I booked 2 rooms for me and my friends to stay and hang out in for the birthday occasion: one deluxe king room and one double room. Both rooms had luxurious amenities. The beds were very comfortable with great sheets and down comforters. The room had a 42\" LCD TV with all HD Channels. The bathroom robes were Frette and the mirrors were anti-fog. It's nice to be able to take a shower and not have to aerate the room to finish getting ready for the night! The staff here is very friendly and really tries to make sure their customers are happy. The location of the hotel is perfect. You're still in a good area of downtown San Francisco yet away from all the craziness of Union Square (but only 2 blocks away from main shopping areas). It's a great option for visitors who want an alternative to Union Square hotels. I always feel that Union Square hotels are expensive for what they offer so if you're looking for a beautiful larger room for the same price, this is the place for you. There are 2 things that you should be aware of when you stay here. Overnight parking at the hotel is a bit steep. It's about $47.00 a night per car. The valet people here are nice and you get \"in and out\" privileges. Also the mini-bars are motion censored for each item. I do not advise that you take any contents out so you can make room to put something in of your own (my friends staying in the double room did this). The second you take the item out it'll get charged to your room, even if you put the item back right away. The process to get the charges reversed and funds back into my account is kind of a pain so hopefully you all won't make this mistake as well.

On entering the room first thing you notice is the superb floor to ceiling windows with lovely view across the bay. Great ! No housekeeping issues, the room was spotlessly clean, as was the whole hotel. One evening we were warned to avoid a spilled drink on entering the elevator, by the time we had dumped our shopping in the room and returned to the lobby - it had been cleaned up. The bathrooms have no tub on 28th floor, I believe only the top three floors have tubs - other rooms are just showers. Like many newer hotels the bathroom doors slid closed but did not lock - could be annoying. The flatscreen tv had excellent reception, unlike some other hotels we visited on our trip. The in-room safe was very shallow, unable to store cameras unless very compact size. Hotel location turned out much better for us than we expected. Bloomingdales is just one block away, with the Market Street cable cars also handy. Union Square is a close walk, and as we were walking around the city it felt a better area around the hotel than around Union Square actually. The huge Westfield shopping mall is within the block so the usual food court options are available whilst open. Directly across the road from the hotel is The Chieftain Irish Bar, which had a good choice of local brews, really tasty fish and chips and burgers - and of course, draught Guinness. The staff in here were very friendly also. A few quibbles. The hotel valet parking is $52.44, fair enough for those requiring valet, if expensive. No mention is made that a huge self-park garage is directly behind the hotel @ $30. Hotel website could refer to nearby self-park option. The Visit Luce insert offering a complimentary glass of wine for every entree dish ordered during dinner. Whoopee-do ! Sofitel does this much better offering a complimentary glass of wine or beer at the hotel bar/restaurant - even without ordering food. Often we go on to order more drinks and/or food at a Sofitel after the free drinks - the offer at Luce - we didn't bother. Actually, the Luce bar itself is rather like an airport departure lounge, sited awkwardly opposite the elevators. Not very enticing, but again the staff were great. Final quibble, the bottled water, Evian if I recall, available to guests @ $8 per bottle. We bought some at a nearby deli exactly the same @ $1.20 per bottle. Nobody appreciates being hosed. Our previous night at a Hampton Inn @ $79 rate had two complimentary bottles of water in room. We paid $250 at the Intercontinental. Previously in SF we stayed at Fisherman's Wharf or Union Square, without doubt we preferred staying in SoMa area and will do so in future. To sum up, for us this hotel was an excellent choice, the view of the sunrise across the bay, the cleanliness, location and friendly staff, mean we will definitely stay here next time in SF.

The new room was nice and clean - beds were comfortable. The staff sent a fruit plate with an appology . Once in the room, we called to have our bags delivered to the room. After waiting an hour, we went to the lobby to aquire them ourselves. There was no appology or assistance and were rudely handed our bags. Here is some info on the rest of the property: POOL/HOT TUB/WORK OUT AREA - the pool is a lap pool only - and is nice and clean. The hot tub had an over abundance of chlorine which made our eyes water. We notified the management but was in the same condition the following day. SPA - just ok. We have been in lavish spas...and this is definately the lower end of the scale. Typically there is a great place to hang and relax with the girls prior to and after the treatment - well - don't expect to do this at the spa. There is no separate hot tub area either. We were directed to the pool area when I asked. The shower/make-up area can only accomodate two people and I had difficulties keeping the water warm in the shower. There were three of us who booked 50 minute deep tissue massages - and we all agreed that the treatments were mediocre at best. Definately not worth the price. CONCIERGE - don't waste your time with him. He is useless. Dinner Recommendations: We called for a recommendation for seafood and reservations and we were directed to a dive. Waste of a cab fare and our time. Even the Cabbie was concerned when we arrived at the restaurant. So the Cabbie had much better recommendations for fantastic seafood! Alcatraz Tour: We had called the concierge twice about the alcatraz tour and he noted it was sold out both days. We decided to \"chance\" it the second day (at the advice of a local) and show up at the dock and got in without a hitch. Once again - he was useless. So, for those future travelers out there - if the trip is all \"booked up\" - they do take standbys and can typically accomodate all who show up. We recognized that dealing with the concierge was an exercise in futility and no longer entrusted in him for the remainder of the stay. WHAT THEY DON'T TELL YOU: Stay away from 5th Street at night. It is a know area where drug deals frequently occur. We wondered down Fulsom Street for some GREAT food (definately try Basil) and heard about the drug dealers from the locals. Even our Cabbie wouldn't drive down 5th Street. Fulsom Street is a little sketchy - but there were a few diamonds in the rough that were worth dinning at. Just make sure you take a cab both ways. Also, if you are into the night club scene...check out Butter.

Sure, you have the 4 seasons, the Campton Place and a very few others, but for the most part, most hotels in SF are old and dated. I'm sorry to say this, but it's true. The Intercontinental is south of Market and Mission, so it's a little bit of a walk to anything other than the Convention Center. If you're in SF for a Convention, the Inter is by far the best. If you want to shop or do business you'll probably have to taxi to where-ever you're going, which is a shame. The parking arrangement at the hotel is very convenient, one of the best in SF. The problem is it's VERY expensive ($48/night). The other problem deals with the front desk. If you don't care what kind of room you have, disregard this comment. But if you do care, and for example, want a king bed instead of a double, or a nice City view or a higher level room or whatever, be prepared to do battle. Depending on who you get, you'll either be told \"the hotel is sold out\" and you have no options. That's always my favorite. Or, it'll cost you $100 more for whatever it is you want. If you get this one, they'll barter with you. Hold out for $30. That seems to work best. Or you may have to ask for a manager. In any case, they have no easy quick way to find the different types of rooms available. Or if they do, nobody seems to know how to do it. And then most of the time, they'll act like they really don't want to help you. As long as you go along with their program, everything is fine. Once you get past the front desk, the hotel is really nice. There are separate showers and flat screen TVs in every room. Many rooms have incredible views. They also have corner rooms which I haven't tried but which look pretty nice. The food in room service is also extremely good, as is the service. Like almost all hotels now, you have to pay for WiFi. Whatever happened to free WiFi ...? The rates at the hotel seems to vary greatly. The online rates appear significantly lower than the regular room rate, though the hotel is new. Besides the 4 seasons, I think it's the nicest hotel in town now.

A big negative was that the room was adjacent to the ice machine room and stairwell (room 902). Though not often, a loud crashing noise came from the ice machine as it filled buckets. The stairwell was used aggressively, why I don't know, at around 3am each night of my stay. It was situated directly behind the headboard and the noise reverberated throughout the room and of course woke each of us up. I suspect it was a staff member checking for breakfast order cards in a manner as efficient as possible for him or her, but I'm not sure.

I can recommend both hotels wholeheartedly. However, my personal favorite (by just a few points) is the InterContinental. For others, the balance might tip the other way. Both are modern hotels, about 33-34 floors in height. The Westin Market Street has the advantage of a location that is slightly closer to Union Square, the symbolic center of San Francisco, and is right in the heart of a busy downtown area, almost adjacent to the new Four Seasons Hotel on Market Street and the St. Regis hotel on Third Street. (The I.C. is about one l.o.n.g block, or 3 short blocks, farther from the center, but is still close.) The Westin also has a very attractive indoor-outdoor restaurant on the quiet back side of the hotel. Rooms at both hotels were similar in size. The room at the Westin was fine--no complaints at all--but the room at the I.C. was somehow just a bit more stylish, and the bathroom was definitely larger and more attractive. We could only get a 9th floor room at the Westin, on the back side, but, to our surprise, the view was great! Wonderful open grassy spaces around the Moscone (Convention) Center, as well as other public parks and squares. (On the front side of the Westin, you probably need to be higher to have a really good view.) At the I.C., virtually all rooms above the 6th floor will have a good view, since the hotel is just a bit south of the high-rise downtown area. Our room, on the 24th floor, had a great view of the San Francisco Bay (and other sights), while my sister's room, on the 25th floor, had an equally great view the other way of the downtown highrises. The sixth floor at the I.C. has a very good lap pool, and a large weight/exercise room with good natural light. The I.C. also has a rather attractive restaurant on the ground (lobby) floor, with high ceilings. It was not very busy the night we were there, although the bar area was jammed and hopping. The concierge gave us advice and directions on restaurants close to the I.C., and we were satisfied with his advice. However, San Francisco has such a great number of good restaurants that one really needs to pin down the kind you want before asking advice, since the list of good restaurants is almost endless. In conclusion, we preferred the I.C. to the Westin Market Street by just a bit, becuase the room was just a bit sharper, the bath a bit bigger, the view a bit better. However, the Westin is a fine hotel, and most people will probably find its location to be just a bit better. I've stayed in a number of San Francisco's better hotels and can recommend most, but either of these, if obtained at a reasonable price, will definitely please most travelers.", "Date": "August 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fairfax, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel Choice for Downtown SF\u201d", "Author": "BlueRTA", "ReviewID": "UR18820440", "Content": "We just spent a week at the Intercontinental San Francisco.

And I wanted to make the one and only visit to San Francisco for my wife as memorable as possible. The tower is amazing, the entrance is a bit of a tiny experience for this kind of place - so was the welcome. Some of the receptionists are not really friendly and do not give you the feeling of being welcome for the money spent and that your special requests matter in any way to the powerful staff. Priority of the welcome interview was given to get the rates of the pre-paid (!) rooms initialed, advise us of the smoking penalties after we booked a non-smoking room (!) and emphasize that no room change is possible without major compromises on our side (after posting special requests 6 months before !). This is the opposite of priority treatment. Unacceptable for this kind of place where even a short stay may cost a decent amount of money. I have experienced exceptional welcomes in Asia and other places in the US so I kow what may be expected. Coming to the room (we paid for an extra category to be in floors 25...30) we really liked the luxury bathroom, noble desk area and super-comfortable beds without the lightest smell from previous guests. Absolutely clean and perfect. Just new... Even if the room was a little small from what we are used to from other luxury hotels we basically got what we expected as far as the room comfort was concerned. The view out of the windows howewer disappointed us greatly. We overlooked the bay area South of Market Street with the incoming freeway. Not the amazing view we booked a high floor for. I just noticed that I did not even take a photo of this ugly view among the 800 pics I took in SF. And the rude lady at the reception told us that there is no possibility to get a more interesting city view that we requested with our booking almost 6 months ago. Good \"management\" of our special request - or was it lack of ....whatever ?

The room was very nice and comfortable, although rather small, but for some reason it wasn't serviced 1 out of the 7 days I stayed there. Additionally, the hotel nickel and dimes you for everything: $30 for a rollaway bed, $15 for internet access, etc. They even tried to charge a fellow traveler for moving (not consuming) items in the minibar! The biggest joke is the \"Instant Service\" button on the phones. It takes them at least 10 rings to answer and then the service is far from \"instant.\" It took nearly 2 hours to get a rollaway bed and when I called twice to have it picked up, it never was. They tried to charge for the extra day even though I had called for its removal but at least removed the charge when I complained. The hotel is new, clean, and upscale but the management is suspect. This is rampant in today's hotel market so I guess I shouldn't expect better.

Our room was gorgeous - we had a corner room on the 30th floor - floor to ceiling windows afforded us a terrific view of the city's skyline to the north and the bay to the east. The bathroom was gorgeous, with ceramic tile, a digital scale, and (what seems to be a rarety for hotels) towels that were actually large enough. The room was also equipped with a very large LCD HDTV, and the bed was exceedingly comfortable. The staff was also exceedingly friendly, helpful, and courteous. Other ammentities included an indoor lap pool, jacuzzi, and a full service spa, and the best gym I've ever seen in a hotel. As you'd expect from an Intercontinental, it truly feels like an upscale hotel and a special experience. Can only say two negative things about our whole experience there. a) the parking fee is outlandish - $46 / night. b) The location may not be the best, depending on why you are visiting San Francisco. Basically, the hotel is situated at the southeast corner of what seems to be a nice area - immediately to the north and to the west are the Mascone Center (San Francisco's convention center), two malls, and a block or two further north is San Francisco's Museum of Modern Art. So if you want to visit the museum or you are attending a convention, the location is great. If you are like me, however, and like to explore on foot, most of the other main attractions are a pretty long ways away.

It has quite simply, the rudest, most ignorant, unhelpful staff of any hotel I have ever stayed in. But let me go into detail..... I checked in at midday and was told my room was not ready. This was fine as, in fairness, i was early. I provided my credit card and passport details and was told by the reception person that I could leave my bag with the porters and pick up my key at any time after 3pm. I actually ended up returning to the hotel at 10pm, at which time there was a huge queue at reception. I asked the porter if he could get the key from reception for me but was told... in no uncertain terms... that he couldn't help. Now, having queued once that day, I wasn't about to do it again... so I stood to one side at the main desk and got one of the reception staffs attention while she was between guests. When I told her i was picking up a key she said \"You'll have to join the line.\" When I explained the situation she turned away, dealt with another customer and then asked me my name, which she eventually looked up in the system. She then told me that I hadn't in fact checked in and so would have \"to join the line.\" Now, I was getting a bit peeved at this point and told here there was no way I was joining the line. So... she ignored me... and ignored me... and ignored me... for at least ten minutes. I then asked to speak to her manager... and was ignored. So a few minutes later when it was clear that she wasn't getting the manager I asked again... so she left her post and went to the other end of the desk where her manager was also dealing with people. Great I thought.... the manager will be along now and we can get this sorted! How wrong I was! The manager also completely ignored me and left me standing there like a lemon! Eventually, and this is after a good half hour of waiting... I actually did join the line. I honestly couldn't believe it... they made a mistake checking me in (i still wonder just what did they do with my details the first time around) and I had to pay for it with my time. Unbelieveable. So, none too happy I asked to see a manager the next day. The only manager available was the head of security who came out \"Maffia style\" (i.e. flanked by a blank faced goon with an ear piece). In fairness to him, he listened to the issue and grudgingly apologised but didn't offer any remedial gesture what so ever. He also never explained why he felt it necessary to have his own personal security guard with him while listening to my complaint. This hotel is new and it shows. The staff are completely clueless as to how guests are normally treated in a hotel of this standard. As for the hotel and facilities... the public spaces are minimalist.... i.e. all the charm of an airport lounge. The rooms are nice but there are no baths which I know quite a few people didnt like.

The furnishing is very modern and bright. The bathroom was spacious and although the water pressure was a little low there was nothing to complain! Room Service: Adapting to SF styles we went for light foods, the best food we found was the bean soup. A little awkward is that the hotel charges the tip automatically, then 3$ for delivery, plus tax... we are not used to this coming from Europe. Pricing in general for f&b is high, but a good Euro to USD rate helped us ignore the pricing a little... Air Conditioning / Bed: The airconditioning worked perfectly. You can change between Fahrenheit and Celsius, and the temperature can be regulated by .5 degrees. The bed was the best I slept in so far-and I travel a lot, and stay at top brands. But this bed beat everything, just like the linen! Perfect! The Club Level: It was very nice of the management to upgrade us to the club, as you enjoy breakfast and snacks during certain hours. Complimentary drinks are available all time. The only criticism we would have is that the service (f&b) at the club is terribly aloof, and often is overwhelmed by their duty. Often plates piled up, cutlery was not exchanged (like at Hyatt), and often you had to ask for things which were then brought quickly though. All in all, if you stick around the city during the day, I would go for it again! In general the IC SF is a more business oriented hotel, but we meet other honeymooners, and casual guests.
