The property is at once no frills and a luxury boutique. If that sounds like a contradiction, it is. And so is this hotel. So far as I can tell, this is a very old property that was renovated. And by renovated, I mean the rooms, lobby and even the elevators were designed by a modernist with good style. The hotel looks cool. However, it simultaneous seems that very little money was put into the structure itself. The elevators are 1930 tenement house slow and rickety. This may be the only place on the planet where I got no cell phone reception whatsoever. The wireless internet is free - and slow as all hell. And forget about room service - absent a non-affiliated restaurant that delivers dinner, they have none. But what really got me was their concierge. He was there both times I stayed at the hotel. The first time, I hailed a cab to go to the airport. As I was getting into the cab, he came out of the hotel, physically stopped me and told me that at hotels in San Francisco, you have to get a cab that is being dispatched to the hotel. (By the way, that is not the law AT ALL.) This led to the cab driver and the concierge getting into a confrontation on Geary Street. Another unlabelled cab pulled up, the concierge took my bags without invitation and put them into the second cab. That cab driver than slipped him a $10. The best part is that second cab driver refused to take a credit card (which is actually against the law in SF, I believe), so I had to pay in cash and could not expense the ride. That's the concierge up $10, hotel guest down $45 if you are keeping score at home. Not to be outdone, on my second visit (my secretary assumed I wanted to stay there again - I didn't), the valet pulled my rental car away to park as I was checking in (even though he said he could let it sit for two minutes while I checked in). I then needed to wait 20 minutes for the valet to go and get the car. Fine. But when I went to take my own bags out of the car, the same concierge from the first trip came out of the hotel, looked at my wallet, looked at me, looked at my wallet again and nodded to the valet, as if demanding a tip. So fine, I tipped the valet. At which point the concierge actually went up to the valet to see what I tipped him. Maybe you had to be there to witness that, but it was a bit presumptuous to say the lease. So, my concierge, I tipped the valet (which I would have done anyway). And now I have a tip for all of you - don't stay at this hotel.", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Williamsburg, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cCharming boutique hotel convenient to Union Square\u201d", "Author": "pgolden", "ReviewID": "UR122201837", "Content": "Not having visited S.F. for more than 40 years, I scoured Trip Advisor and other sites in choosing a place to stay for a six day stay over Christmas with my family. I kept coming back to the Hotel Diva and am glad we stayed here. If you can get a good rate on this hotel (we got ours for about $125 on hotels.com), I'd say jump at it. The hotel is convenient to Union Square, two blocks from Powell and within 5 minutes of the nearest BART station. Front desk staff were great and very responsive and helpful throughout our stay. A Starbucks adjacent to the lobby was a plus for us (despite what we note below). A saki decanter nightly, and morning Ghirardelli hot chocolate in the lobby were also nice touches. The beds were very comfortable and the heating/AC worked well and was not noisy (like is often the case with individual units in other hotels). The room was large enough for me, my wife and our college-age son (which was a primary concern of ours). Only a few negatives would be noted, and I hope they've fixed a few of those for the next guests. The tub and sink drained very slowly and the toilet flapper valve sometimes stuck in the open position. A simple jiggle fixed the latter, but in the middle of the night...well, you don't want to wait to make sure the toilet stops! A couple of the electric plugs in a set of four behind the bed also didn't work, which meant you could plug in the bed reading lights or the clock, but not all three. Those things could be easily fixed, as I said. Our specific room (219) was directly over the Starbucks, and we could hear (slightly, but enough to make out the song) the music they play. OK if you are not a light sleeper. Other than that the room was very quiet, with only the normal floor creaks you'd hear in an older building. Our room was away from the street as well. Part of the charm for many at this hotel could be the stylishness of the decor, but it has unintended drawbacks. The wire mesh chairs in the rooms don't lend themselves to lounging for long periods of time, and the darker hues of the room mean that the rooms are darker overall than one might like. Still, if you come to San Francisco and stay in your room all day you're missing something! Others note in their reviews that the homeless around here were off-putting.

While it did have some modernistic styles to it, some of that was just plain weird and made the place feel cold. Neon blue lights in the elevators and metal sinks that made you feel like you were washing up in a garbage disposal! We were first given a \"Two Room Studio Queen\" and while the main room was fine, the one with the murphy bed was stark and creepy. I pulled down the murphy bed which had a thin sheet on it, not comphy blanket or pillow like the other bed. I asked housekeeping for towels and to make up the murphy bed and when we returned from our evening out, the towels were there on the unmade bed. I called again and the \"housekeeping\" but really a guy who looked like a maintenance man arrived and said \"what would you like me to do?\" with a snarky tone. He pointed me to a closet w/pillows and a blanket. Excuse me, didn't realize I had to make my own bed at a hotel. I turned on the flatscreen and it was all snowy w/terrible reception. Off to a good start. The second night we switched to a regular room w/two queen sized beds. They told us which room to go to. Later we found the bathroom was not cleaned (you don't want to know...) as well as garbage left by previous guests. That TV also was difficult to see and the clock we were given was set on a completely wrong time and the ipod plug in didnt work. Speaking of my ipod (ipad) while there was free wi-fi, it was terrible and barely worked. I'm guessing they did clean the room the following nights b/c of the housekeeping knocks on the door while we were still sleeping in the morning. They may want to consider those little \"please do not disturb\" door hangers to solve that problem. To top it all off, there is an alley alongside the hotel that every night at about 3am bottle pick woke us up and kept us up as loud crashing noises filled our room!

While it is clean, comfortable for the price and in a generally central location downtown making it a good location, Hotel Diva did not deliver. The lobby is fine, hot tea or sake sitting out for guests, good reception service and an inviting blue lit elevator. Then the room reality sets in. We had a double room with two separate sleeping areas. However, there was no seating area for the 2 of us to sit and visit without sitting on each other's beds. The first room was comfortable and the soft throw a nice touch, however the second room with the murphy bed was pretty tight. You couldn't have the door open to the closet and stand at the bathroom sink, or walk around the bed easily to sit on the metal chairs placed at the side. It was pretty bare bones and not the decadent diva personality we anticipated. Where was the hot pink decor or over the top opulence? The grey paint had many black marks and grey can be depressing if not in prime condition. The steel decor elements helped but did not convey the sleek and sophisticated feel of a plush hotel room. Sadly disappointing. And while the condom placed in the safe indicating \"safe sex\" was cute, we almost missed it as the safe was in the dark closet and impossible to view. Who can see in the dark! While the price point for a hotel near Union Square drew us in we unfortunately won't book again as it failed to live up to the hotel name.

I chose Hotel Diva after researching here for suite hotels on Union Square close to the start of the race. Hotel Diva offered a kid's suite that promised a separate room with a tv, Wii, music, karaoke and toys for the kids. When I was making my reservation I asked if it would be fun for eight and 10 year old boys. He said he thought so. We checked in late and they were very friendly, gave the boys some welcome packages that were a little young for them but they had chocolate! So appreciated. But they didn't give us much information about the perks of staying at the hotel we later learned. The room is located on the third floor in the back of the hotel. The elevators were very cool with blue lights. You walk in the room and to your right is the kids room. It has it's own sink, mirror, closet, dresser, low table with toys and paper to draw on. Bunk beds that the boys said were very uncomfortable. A karaoke machine with only songs like Old McDonald had a farm etc.but you could make cool sounds with it which entertained the boys. And just a flat screen that wasn't a TV, just a dvd player and no Wii was there. The room had a lot of pink girl dress up stuff hanging around, the photos were of girl stuff so this made the boys unhappy. There is a good sized bathroom with a toilet, bathtub and a nice shower with great pressure. Sink & mirror outside the bathroom with nice products and a hairdryer. In a separate room is the other bedroom. With a queen bed, nice pillows, weepy mattress, dresser, very uncomfortable chair, desk, coffee stand with a Kerig(sp?), closet and a small flat screen on the wall. Also a window that looks directly into the window of a room in the next hotel over(who had much better tv channels) and a view into the windows of the restaurant below. The room is very quiet with little street noise. The TV is not very good, few channels and difficult to navigate. Wireless was available but really slow on my iphone so I didn't use it. The next morning we went down and ask for the Wii and they gave us a box with the Wii controller, games and dvds. The games were Wii Resort and other safe and young child games. The dvds were geared to the very young kids as well. The hotel was very clean! The perks we learned as we were there for 5 nights: Little workout room on the second floor: I used the workout room which was fine when I was alone but can't imagine trying to use it with more than two people. Rumor of complimentary coffee on the 7th floor in the mornings? I just went to Starbucks every morning and spent $20. Sake in the evenings. We finally discovered this and enjoyed a couple of nights in the tiny lobby with only two seats and tic tac toe. Nearby: Starbucks next door - very happy with this. The Mexican restaurant on the other side: we had wonderful tequila at the bar one night, the food smelled great and it appeared they delivered to the hotel but hard to get a table. Katana-Ya two doors down - great ramen, long lines all day long! The kids loved the ramen. Diner on the corner across the street - yummy, huge servings, good service, great for breakfast(great pancakes) but pricey. Max's diner down the street towards Union Square very good burger (patty melt) the desserts looked heavenly. Location is convenient but on the border of rough. Lots of homeless guys asking for money all day long, lots of people smoking outside which made my kids miserable. But close to all the great shopping, lots of restaurants, the cable car, easy (for us we are in good shape) walk to Chinatown, and the ferry terminal. We used the hotel's house car to get back to the airport which was great! About $55. In summary: location was good for what I needed, service was nice but could be a bit more helpful and informative, the room was good but not enough space in the adult room(only on the bed) to relax after a long day of walking or running, the kid's room was very spacious but I wish they had more choices for older kids in the movies, Wii games and songs(next time I'll bring my own) and wish the decor would be more neutral for the boys. Yes, I know it's called Hotel DIVA!

It's overpriced for my budget, but so is everything in Union Square, and especially with a convention in town. The convenience allowed me to ditch the idea of a rental car, which off-set the typical hotel room allowance. FINE BY ME! When I checked in, I joked with the front desk clerk when he said, \"let me see what I have\" responding \"Something fabulous\"....and he did. He upgraded me to a beautiful room on the 6th floor (601, by the way) with more than I needed for my one night stay. I wished I could have stayed longer! The room was clean and equipped with a computer docking station, huge monitor, USB charging station, a PRINTER (for gosh sake) and flat screen TV's in both the living room area and the bedroom. There was even a microwave AND a Keurig coffe machine with an assortment of coffee, tea and hot chocolate. The only amenity missing I would like to have had would have been a refrigerator had I stayed longer, but I can hardly complain about that given the business-minded amenities already there! The only \"bad\" thing I can say about this hotel was that the beds were so comfy, I didn't want to get out of it in the morning.

We returned to San Francisco last week to see old sites and see old friends. We selected this hotel based on it's location near Union Square and funky style as shown in photos. It's not a luxury establishment. If you want to spend 4-5 times as much there are plenty available, but it's much better than it's location (within 2 blocks of Union Square at the edge of the Tenderloin) and price would suggest. Rooms are clean, decent size, with even a cozy alcove with table and chairs, but surprisingly no a coffee maker. That's provided in a service area on another floor every morning starting a 6:30 weekdays and 7 on weekends - coffee or tea - no pastries, or anything else. The style is somewhat spartan, but the beds were quite comfortable and everything \"worked\" including big screen TV and free WiFi. Our room had \"zero\" view: airshaft which amplified street sounds, but was almost by design: we avoided window on street by recommendation for that very reason and generally our room was reasonably quiet at night: only serious problem was Tuesday (trash removal day) the rumbling and slamming of cash bins at 3 a.m. would wake the dead. They have a \"business center\" - actually a small room with two computer terminals and one printer. A big plus is the super accommodating, friendly staff. Though the immediate area is a little iffy lots of homeless (this has become a S.F. problem - they're everywhere) so the hotel area was not particularly more of that than elsewhere in the town. But, a few blocks further away from Union Square it does get a little dicey and we agree with other reviewers that one should not stray there afoot at night - no problem in the daytime if you don't call attention to yourself and we walked through that area without problem in the day time.. Course part of the problem is that there appear to be a lot of \"borderline\" homeless in S.F., folks on the way down and others who dress in a sort of shabby chic local style not much different from homeless except a little \"cleaner\" looking. The hotel is right across the street from live theater and the whole area if loaded with first class restaurants - and some real greasy spoons, too. It's a short walk to cable car/bus lines and about a 10 block walk from Market Street terminal or Chinatown . More on that in another review.

Some of the reviews had said the rooms were too small and noisy, but I thought they were fine. Not big by any means, but not tiny either. Usually when I go on vacation I like to spend time out in the city, not couped up in the room, so size isn't a huge factor. I guess if you want to hang out and do cartwheels in your room, probably not the place for you. I am also a heavier sleepier and our room was at the back, but noise wasn't a factor for our stay. I am more concerned with cleanliness, comfort of the bed, location and friendly staff, which I felt that Hotel Diva had all the above. I loved the decor of the rooms! They were very trendy, minimalist style, which sometimes less is better. And clean, which is always nice. The beds were great, except for the fact that they were so great I didn't want to get up! The staff was great, very helpful and welcoming. We liked the location as well, it was right by Union Square and an easy walk to BART (which I would totally recommend to and from the airport). The only issues we had, which are very minimal and hardly even worth mentioning, was that the elevators were a little slow, you had to have a special key for the business center and we are pretty sure the staff came in our room with the \"Diva is In\" (Do Not Disturb sign) on our door. There was a computer on our floor that was keyless access, but if you wanted to print you had to go get a key. Which isn't even that big of an issue, but there was a line to use the computers, and all we wanted to do was print out our boarding passes. Once we actually got to use the computers, the printers were out of ink, so it turned out we wasted our time by waiting. As far as them coming in our room, I am not much of a fan of having people in my room while I am not there, so I would just as soon not have the linens changed. We had the Do Not Disturb sign on the door, and we left to go out. We had the window cracked when we left, which they did not say we couldn't do, but when we got back the window was closed. Nothing was taken or disturbed in the room, but it was just the fact that we had the Do Not Disturb sign on the door, and they came in anyway. Really not huge issues, but just thought I would share.

I've also stayed at at least a dozen other hotels in the area, because I travel on business to San Francisco regularly and am always on the lookout for a good property that I can go back to. I stayed at the Diva most recently because the price was very competitive, but I doubt I'll stay there again. The Diva is a couple of blocks from Union Square, and is near shopping and many restaurants. The area is safe and relatively clean. The lobby is small; you wouldn't want to sit and read a newspaper or have a drink or chat with friends--it's strictly for checking in and out. There's a small business center and exercise room, and free wi-fi in the rooms. All good. The problem for me is (1) the size of the rooms, and (2) the decor, or lack thereof. This last stay, I was in a square white box containing a bed, a thin desk, and a small end table on either side of the bed. There was no room for anything else. The bathroom was just large enough for a tub, sink and toilet. One window, overlooking a fire escape and very narrow alley, such that you wouldn't want to look out of the window, which let in little light. A flat-screen TV attached to the wall, which swings out for viewing from the bed--there's no other place to view it from. Behind the bed, there was a large flat piece of steel bolted to the wall, which seems to be standard in every room. I felt like I was in prison. I don't tend to spend much time in my room--I use it for sleeping and not much else--but it still felt claustrophobic. Although the Diva seems to present itself as new and arty, there's actually very little art work anywhere; it's quite spartan The steel on the wall is not, in my mind, an appealing feature. It lacks both warmth and anything to distract attention from the bare white walls. I was awakened in the wee hours by lots of banging on trash cans from the alley. This is not uncommon for hotels in the area, but some have double windows to better block the noise. There's nothing wrong with a reliably clean, well-located box--if it's priced at the bottom of the scale for the area. The Diva is not pricey, but it's pricey for what you get, and it's a mystery to me. There being so many hotels within a few blocks, I don't find the Diva competitive at its price point, since it offers me absolutely nothing beyond its good location. For about the same price I can find a similar location, a larger room, some attempt at decor, and maybe a wine tasting in the evening, and/or a lobby that's hospitable. I have a friend who stays at the Diva religiously because she likes the work-out room. There's that, but it's by no means the only place around that either has a health club or access to one nearby.", "Date": "December 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cCharming Hotel in the Heart of San Francisco\u201d", "Author": "RedRocksPhoto", "ReviewID": "UR89828865", "Content": "Steps away from the heart of San Francisco.

However, the area right around the Hotel is a bit seedy and not too attractive to wander around at night. The room was clean and did not have any problems with smell or inoperative bathroom fixtures as noted in some previous reviews. However the room I had was quite small, OK for 1 person but it would have been a tight squeeze for 2. More importantly, the hotel had a higher noise level than that found in more modern buildings. I could easily hear conversations in other rooms. More problematic was the noise from the garbage trucks early in the morning, Perhaps a room on a higher floor (I was on the second) would be better. The free internet worked well and the internet lounges were attractive. There is free coffee from 7-10AM in one of the lounges. This is nice, but coffee the rest if the day of some fruit or pastries in the morning would have been a nice touch. There is a Starbucks next store, but the line can be long so having better access to coffee would be nice for those in a hurry.

The grout in our shower was dirty and kind of gross. In addition, the shower curtain had no weight so it kept touching my leg as I bathed which I found disgusting. The sheets and bedding in the room were clean but I was not impressed with the carpet. The navy blue color is great at masking stains but I could still see them if I looked hard enough. The grossest thing that I noticed was some dog feces in the corner of my room.

We were in the midst of everything and a few blocks from Union Square, which makes it incredibly convenient. Fortunately, because we were only in San Fran for a few days, we were only in our hotel to sleep. Aside from Diva's location, the concierge, David, was wonderful. He had quite the personality and knew about reserving city tours, public transportation, etc. He was very helpful. However, the desk clerk, Christian, was incredibly snotty and quite \"diva\" like, which is ironic, considering our overall opinion on this hotel. After several delays at the airport, we were quite weary when we arrived, and he gave us a \"Queen\" room, despite having a print out of our reservation stating \"King\" accommodations. After requesting that we receive our original reservation, he acted as if he was doing us a favor by switching rooms, which was ridiculous. As many have mentioned, it's an older hotel which recently underwent a facelift. Unfortunately, the \"diva\" look can only take it so far. We had a \"Deluxe\" room, which was very small. Because of the size of the room, it was difficult to maneuver our luggage or to move around. The bathroom was tiny...no space to put toiletries, so we left everything out on the desk. The walls were thin, so you hear everything...the people creaking up and down the halls, others in bordering rooms, and doors opening and closing-all night long. Finally, they have a Diva \"Boudoir\", which includes two vending machines and an IKEA lounge. Seriously? More disappointing than anything was the cleanliness of the place. I'm not a high-maintenance person, but I expect to be provided with clean towels and sheets. Our \"white\" sheets were stained and dinghy looking. We requested to have them changed the following morning, and they were replaced with sheets that looked just as dirty. As for the bathroom towels, they were gray, stained and dirty-looking as well. Clearly these need replaced. Apparently, there is a suite area on the top floor of the Diva, so maybe the guests up there actually have cleaner linens? This place had a facelift a few years back, but it doesn't seem they've kept up with it. It certainly is anything but \"Diva\" like. It just wasn't up to par for the price.

We were also very impressed by the efficiency and pleasantness of the staff at the hotel. The room was of a very good size and the beds were very comfortable after a busy day sightseeing. One problem we did face during our stay was the sound proofing of the rooms, this was only a minor issue until we were troubled with some less than desirable guests next door. There was screaming and shouting going on until the early hours of the morning, something which was very alarming and scary to be quite honest. The lack of sound proofing really exaggerated this unfortunate issue. The hotel also did nothing about these problems until the next day, something we found unsatisfactory as they appeared to have known about it far earlier. The issue was resolved the next day but not to the level we believe it shold have been. Overall The Diva is a good value hotel in a fantastic location for sightseeing in San Francisco.

It's always one of the main things we look for in a hotel and Diva definitely ticked that box for us. The only thing we were a bit surprised about was the size of the rooms - they are quite small, although we only booked their cheapest so this may not be the same in the pricier rooms. We had been warned though that all hotel rooms in San Fran are tiny so we got over it and utilised the quite reasonable amount of storage space and it was fine. Also took a bit of getting used to having the basin and vanity outside of the bathroom! I guess a creative way to use the space. The decor of the room as with the hotel is modern and trendy which we liked. As for the price we thought it was quite good value for money, despite our 4th night being much more expensive - being a Saturday night and also over Fleet week and with the President's Cup golf on this was understandable.

Hotel Diva is located right near Union Square and in the PERFECT San Francisco location. Not too touristy, not to shady, just right! One of the best parts of the Hotel Diva was the STARBUCKS located right inside the lobby! We girls love our coffee! The check in was easy and our room was spacious. The only issue we had, but it wasn't that big of a deal, was we were promised an Executive King Room with a Sleeper Sofa and our soft wasn't a sleeper at all. But again, no big deal. The bathroom was also VERY small... for two girls it was a bit tight, but we both had our own vanity type areas to actually \"get ready\" in, so that worked out nicely. The hotel is an old, classic, San Francisco style building with a modern take. The beds are VERY comfortable and the street noise is actually quite soothing. Just next door is a really tasty pizza by the slice joint which served us well after a night of clubbing! Try their pistachio gelato (YUMTASTIC)!

We had no choice since we were not paying for the room and a lot was booked up since it was also Pride weekend. The hotel is in a convenient area. Some say it's shady but it's not. It's across the Clift, on the same street as Westin St. Francis and seriously 2 short blocks to Union Square. The best part of the hotel was the location. Can't be beat. The room decor was pretty much DWR. Very modern. The size of the rooms are very small but luckily we were not spending a lot of time in our room. The room seemed clean but not the stark kind of clean that I prefer. The shower head was just average. Luckily there was a flat screen tv for my husband to watch. We were placed on the second floor which was handy because we just walked up thes stairs. There was a window but no view. A view into a restaurant next door. We tried the restaurant downstairs one night because we were lazy. It's a Mexican tapas style place but the portions and prices were bigger than tapas style. The food was okay. My husband liked his dish but I didn't love my entree. It was some chicken dish. I probably wouldn't eat here again. I heard Mamacita's is awesome if you're looking for Mexican share plates. If I were to get a good deal I'd stay here again but otherwise not really. The rate that was paid for our stay was close to $300 as it was last minute and a busy weekend. PS. Sorry for the photos.

The staff were friendly & helpful, the public areas of the hotel were spotless & well maintained. The rooms were excellent especially for the star rating. But the one thing that recommends this hotel above all others are the beds. They are wonderful, firm but not bouncy with the added bonus of what seemed to be a mattress topper, high quality linens & huge squishy pillows that didn't loose their shape the moment you put your head onto them. Completely wonderful. I am sure that a good bed that encourages a good nights sleep must be at least number two on the list of essentials for any traveller. The only downsides I can think of are: - The fact that board is on a room only basis but there are options for breakfast locally. - The fact that rooms on facing into the internal courtyard get very little daylight - The fact that the rooms on the side of the hotel away from Geary ajoin two noisey late night bars & an alleyway with glass recycling bins that are filled & emptied on a regular basis. This process is as noisy if not more so than the bars. We experienced this on the first night & having complained we were accommodated in a new room away from the noise with very little fuss. The hotel management say that they are in the process of soundproofing so it's not all bad news.

Not sure what some folks think when they book a room in the middle of a fairly large city. I expected the rooms to be small, I expected city noise, I expected to encounter all kinds of people, including the homeless. What I found at the Hotel Diva was a decent-sized room (which they graciously upgraded for me), not much noise (the only noise I heard was an occasional door-slamming), and some homeless folks that were actually quite friendly and totally harmless. The staff was top-notch - everyone we encountered from the manager to the cleaning staff couldn't do enough to make our stay enjoyable. The room was very IKEA-like - slick and efficient. Plenty of room for two. I liked the fact that the sink was located separately from the bathroom which made it quick and easy for two of us to get ready for the day. Plus, the room was spotless! We were upgraded to the 7th floor, which included a lovely continental breakfast each morning with coffee that rivaled Starbucks (which was right next door, by the way). As someone else commented, the lobby wasn't much to speak of but who spends time in the lobby? It was small, but sleek with a concierge that was pleasant and very helpful. If it weren't for him we might have missed our day trip to Yosemite. The tour company for some reason had our name wrong on their list, but the concierge ran out and caught up with the driver and got it straightened out - and we didn't even book the trip through him. Definitely take advantage of the wonderful (and free) wine reception offered in the lobby a few nights during the week (I think its Tues through Thurs from 4pm-6pm). Let's talk location. You can't beat the location of the Diva. It's in Union Square, blocks from public trans that can get you anywhere in the city. We didn't need a car, and at $35 a night for parking and gas at $4.09 a gallon, public trans is a blessing and a bargain. We took BART from the airport ($5.25) to Powell St. and walked to the hotel, with luggage in tow. No major hills from Powell to Geary - about a 5-block walk. Get yourself a 1- or 3-day Muni pass and take the subway, bus, trolley or cable car anywhere in the city - all right there from Powell St. You're within walking distance to restaurants, shops, nightclubs and theaters. We walked to Chinatown one evening for dinner - not a bad walk at all, no major hills involved. Honestly, we didn't have one bad thing to say about this hotel. I'm always leery booking something sight unseen and have been burned more than once, but you can't go wrong here. The price is right, the location is great, and you won't encounter a better staff.

Flat panel TV, a lateral file cabinet for a dresser, curled steel as a headboard, great toiletries, condom in the safe (safe sex!), removable tatoos, clock radio with MP3 player connection, coffee maker, and best of all - FREE WIRELESS INTERNET access! + The beds were very comfortable. + The front desk people always greeted me when I arrived and left. The wine reception at night was a nice touch. Loved coming \"home\" and being greeted by wine! - My room had windows that was not facing Geary, but the other street (is it Palmer?) is noisy on the weekends thanks to 2 popular nightclubs. One had an overflow crowd on the sidewalk waiting to gain entrance, which means a lot of loud talking, laughing, etc. BUT during the week, it was relatively quiet. - Yes, there are homeless people hanging around Geary, but geez....this is SF Union Square and there are homeless EVERYWHERE!

The rooms were not fancy, but decorated nicely with a bit of modern flair, sort of like Ikea with a hotel twist.

We had to turn it off in order to sleep. There were some late-night revelers who came home when the bars closed, and the door slams were pretty loud; police sirens woke us up once, as did some hallway chitchat. The noise problems were about the only really negative things about the place, yet we didn't sleep well as a result, and that pretty much ruined us for the following day.

My husband and I arrived well before the appointed check-in time, and were very pleased to find out they could check us in (we figured we would just store our bags, so this was very nice). The room, however, was extremely small (shoe-box size, no room even to put our very small travel bags so we could open them) and smelled VERY musty. The bathroom was tiny and poorly designed (tub/shower combo and toilet in the bathroom, while the sink was in the hotel room itself -- kind of gross in our opinion). The bed was very small (a double?) but we had reserved a queen. When it became clear that opening the windows was clearly not helping the musty smell, we decided to complain, as we were staying for 5 nights, and our rate was quite pricey (approx. $250/night). The gentleman at the desk was quite receptive to our complaints (his name was Jay) and he offered to move us the following day and to send up someone to febreeze the room. This helped a bit with the odor, but we were told this happens a lot in the back rooms of the hotel when it rains (and it rains a lot in San Francisco -- so beware these rooms!). True to his word, Jay did indeed move us the following day to a more spacious, better designed and clean smelling room. I felt very pleased with the solution and felt the hotel took our complaints seriously. All in all, not a bad hotel, but nothing special. The rooms are rather sparse (ok in the sense that we liked the minimalist, modern decor), but there are few perks -- not even a minibar fridge in the rooms and very bare bones furnishings.

I was not as impressed with restaurants right on Union Square as I was with others around town, but you can find something to eat pretty easily around the hotel. A few blocks away there is a great Thai place called Arroi and a sushi place called Sanraku. Also liked the diner across the street and down a block for French Toast and walk a few blocks to get to a great French place called Plouf (mussels and clams galore). Oh, and for great Mexican food and a cheap bottle of Dos Equis, visit the taqueria that is across the street and down about two blocks in the opposite direction of Union Square. As far as the complaints go about panhandlers in the area... Whether you're paying $500 for a luxery hotel or $100 for the Diva, you're going to run into panhandlers in SF. Most just stand in one place and call out for change - they do not chase you down or get in your face. If panhandlers make you uncomfortable, perhaps SF is not the right place for you to visit. I felt very safe in the area around the Diva. By the way, due to a flight cancellation, I ended up for a night in the Hilton on O'Farrell Street just a few minutes from the Diva. The price was twice as much as the Diva, but I wouldn't say that it was necessarily worth it, since the Diva was fine by my standards. But, if you are very picky and have the money to spend, the Hilton was very clean, new and comfortable. I stayed in tower 2 in one of the handicap accessible rooms, so it was very roomy as well. The buffalo wings in the lounge were very good. :)", "Date": "March 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Modesto, CA", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Valentines Trip\u201d", "Author": "potterphreak", "ReviewID": "UR6799212", "Content": "For Valentines Day 2007, hubby and I decided to go our favorite restaurant in San Fran and stay the night. After staying at a Personality Hotel on our last trip, there was no way we were going to stay anywhere else!! We booked a king size room at Hotel Diva with the \"Bond with Love\" package and I must say, we were delighted from start to finish!! The staff was amazing and helpful, fun and chatty and our room was better than we could have imagined!! The room was HUGE with a beautiful king bed with 2 night stands, a dresser (filing cabinet), a table with 2 chairs, and a desk with a lamp and drawers. Inside the closet there was a safe with a key, an ironing board and an iron, and a TON of hangers. The sink and counter and mirror were in the room and next to it was the bathroom with a shower/tub combo and a toilet. Excellent water pressure and I am soooo in love with the faucets!!! The bed had 4 king size pillows, 2 regular sized pillows, and was triple sheeted (bottom sheet, top sheet, blanket, another sheet, comforter) and there was another blanket in the closet. There was also a big ol flat screen TV that we could pull out from the wall and watch in bed! We used the a/c on FAN only so I would have some background noise like I have at home. This hotel was SOOOO quiet!! We could hear a murmur or two from neighbors but there was absolutely no outside noise, which is a LOT different from the other Personality Hotel we love (Hotel Union Square). The location was amazing, about a 5 minute walk to Market St. (my fave!) and BART, and there was a Starbucks in the lobby. Hubby was in heaven!! We are coming back to stay at this hotel again in the summer-can't wait to try out the Kids Suite!! We were in room 717 this time.

I don't see how filing cabinets (to be used as a drawer) with cheezy butcher block top is \"modern\" or \"fancy\". It strikes me as cheap. Conceirege was friendly. Location was good if you don't mind Union Square. There is a terrible homeless problem in San Francisco - and plan on getting panhandled dozens of times while at the Diva.

I decided that we would spend a day in San Francisco to see the city, since I had never been. From the website the Diva seemed like a good choice for a place to come back to after a day in the city. It's in a great location close to all the shops. I had booked directly from the hotel's site and at the same time signed up for Personality Perks. That's their frequent guest card that allows for special \"perks\" during your stay. One of the perks being a free room upgrade, upon availability. Well when we got to our room it was a box. I must say that it was very clean, but the pictures on the site are very misleading. There was barely enough room for two people to walk around. The king bed took up 80% of the room. There was a view of a brick wall, and a tiny bathroom. Only one person could stand in it at a time. The only perk I noticed was the free Wi-fi. Which would come in handy later. I knew that this could not have been an upgraded room!! I mean how much smaller could they get. So I went down to the front desk and asked about an upgrade due to my membership in this \"perk \" program. Romy was the attendants name. He stated that I should have gotten a card and there is no record of me in the system. I offered to show him a confirmation email, stating I had in fact signed up. But he said it was o.k, and he had to go and check with the corporate office. Conveniently, they were located just behind him in an office around the corner. I mentioned that we were only there for a day and wanted to get a jump on things. He said he would take care of it ASAP. So I went upstairs to my room and waited 20 minutes. That's when I opened my laptop and started to look for other hotels in the area because ASAP is not 20-30 minutes later!! In fact I was never called back about the upgrade. I was very upset and decided to checkout. I mentioned how I had waited to find out about the room upgrade and some of the other perks that I was supposed to receive upon check-in. Never heard back from that guy. Actually, there were now two new guys there who checked us out and said we would be refunded the full amount. All they asked was \"is this your first time here?\" You would think they would try to rectify the situation at that point. I was much happier spending my money at the Westin down the street.

I was staying for a week on business, so I had to make sure I was going to enjoy it. It looked good, so I booked a room. I ended up getting one towards the inside/back of the hotel, which supposedly is quieter and includes a king beg (vs. a queen bed). One key point to note: this hotel is in one of the best possible locations in downtown SF. Check-in was smooth and the staff was courteous and well-dressed. Actually, most of the clientele tends to be younger and somewhat hip. I think the hotel is trying to go for that anyway, so that's good (I'm a twenty-something myself). I walked into the room, and was disappointed (at first). It was a glorified dorm room. Very small, and you walk RIGHT into it. The bathroom is small, and the sink is outside in the room. On the plus side, I got used to these things rather quickly, and it wasn't a huge deal. One thing to note though: if you leave the door open after taking a shower, the steam will drift into your room, as there is no fan in there (something to keep in mind as you use the bathroom other times). The king size bed is very, very comfy. I've been to the Hard Rock Chicago which sports a king size pillowtop with down bedding and pillows, and Diva definitely took the take. Wireless Internet was wonderful, and seemed to be rather fast most of the time. It's unsecure, just something to keep in mind. SF seems to have free Wi-Fi almost everywhere, though. During my stay, I asked the main clerk working the desk to recommend a good lounge for me. I took his advice, and it turned out pretty well. He also seemed to have a good feel for the area too (doubled as a concierge, I suppose). Check-out was smooth as well, and I was billed correctly. Would I go there again?

If you have a room ending in 20,21 or 22 you will not sleep. These rooms overlook Geary and the hotel has done NOTHING to try and reduce noise. I am used to staying in city hotels, even in SF, but the street noise here was unbelievable. Please, if you are anything other than a very heavy sleeper get a room at the back. Next problem, housekeeping. Being woken up at 745am (when the do no disturb sign was clearly on the door) was not my idea of service, however it got even worse when the next day housekeeping left my door ajar all day. Not good enough - when I contacted the front desk they said they would record the matter and hung up on me. My final problem came when I tried to extend my stay. Whilst they were able to extend my stay one day the hotel was completely booked the next day. Fair enough - it was late notice.

Speaking of 6 AM, I must mention the morning they gave me an unrequested wake-up call at 6 on a Saturday. A SATURDAY. The one morning I was able to sleep in and they screwed it up. The room and the entire hotel had this really strange odor which never really went away the whole time I was here, and the TV had far fewer channels than practically every hotel I've stayed at before. The excercise room was okay. Nothing special but it had everything I needed (treadmill and stairmaster) so I can't complain too much about that. As I mentioned, the in-room wireless internet was nice but it sure did break down a bunch, at least twice a day. It was always back up and running an hour or so later, but still an inconvenience. I should also mention that the room was pretty quiet (besides the creaky floors and loud pipes), since they gave me a room that faced the \"courtyard\" instead of Geary Street, but I've heard it can get really loud if you get a room facing the street so definitely keep that in mind if you decide to stay here.
