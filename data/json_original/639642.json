I've always been happy with Ibis and recommend them to people when they are traveling internationally. Of course you can stay at the higher level Accor brands but for affordability, it's tough to beat Ibis. Hotel is located off the freeway (but you won't be able to see it, drive carefully and have good instructions!). Room was very comfortable, free internet access. Small drawback: hotel shares parking lot with Etap and at night it gets full so if you decide to go out at night, be prepared to park on street if you return late. Neighborhood is nice so there's no concerns of crime.", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Essex", "Title": "\u201cTake care\u201d", "Author": "Two_ronnies", "ReviewID": "UR120371503", "Content": "This is the usual Ibis hotel but there seems to be a problem with thieves who on the night we were there stole luggage from people leaving the Etap hotel next door.

The location is good for the airport, but 30 minutes to Barcelona. The staff was very friendly and helpful and were able to get into a room 2hrs early, which was great as we just got off a ship and were exhausted! We got a room with 2 beds, one a std double (hard) and then a trumble bed (harder). My friend called it the Ikea room! It was very modern Ikea styled room with, tiny hanging closet space and cubicles to store clothes. The room smelled of smokey old man, that's the only way I can describe it! We had to open the window to ventilate and spray perfume as the ac did not work (or entire system set to heat). We had to sleep with window open and turn off heat to not bake to death! The bathroom was different as it was a prefabricated and everything was plastic and continuous. It served its purpose, had a hair dryer, but the towels were thin and small. They offer internet for 5 euros but beware that it is for one person or one device only! My friend logged on with her Ipad and then I was trying to get on and it said the pass code was already used! They offer a nice continental breakfast that starts at 6:30 which was perfect, and have a small bar in the lobby! There is also a Mac Donalds next door ! Note that there is an Etap Hotel attached to this hotel that advertises 39 euros per night. It is situated like part of this hotel was split to make two different hotels....different name and different prices! Overall it was worth the price and served its purpose! The only down side was that they were a pet friendly hotel, and there was a dog barking throughout the night like its owner had left and it was alone!", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gir", "Title": "\u201cIBIS Hotel in Barcelona\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR120279595", "Content": "Hotel is situated no where near Train Station, Taxi cost 10 Euros.

You will be greeted by hardworking and friendly staff. The hotel is relatively clean and quietly located in a small town. It is a bit far from Downtown Barcelona, although the 30 min bus ride (bus station is conveniently located around the corner of hotel entrance) will only cost you 1.20 euro per person. It is approx 5km from BCN airport. Taxi to airport will cost you 20 euro (passenger of 4). Internet is 5 euro/day. One great thing about this hotel is that you are able to extend your stay ( check out is 12 noon but we stayed until 6 pm) for a small cost.

Generally hotels in Barcelona are expensive and Ibis is good value for money. The hotel is at a quiet neighborhood, close to the airport and has an outdoor closed free parking. It is also close to the railways station parking where you can leave your car free and use a combination of railway and metro to visit Barcelona. Rooms are small but clean and the air condition worked fine. Good sleep quality. No hand towel at the bathroom which was not so clean as the room. The hotel provides wifi at a fee 5eur/24h. The only disappointment was during check out with the invoice. They had charged me with beverages from the bar, which i had never ordered.

No cabbie knew it and had to use the GPS. It is indeed 5km from the airport - around 20 euro fare- in the middle of an industrial park. No place to eat around there. Just a big McDonalds. There is public bus (L86) that can take you at Plaza Espanya in 30 mins for 1.5 euros. The rooms are clean, a bit small, but well appointed and confortable. Wifi was extremely slow.The airconditioning was fine. The sound insulation was good. The TV was a new flat screen with several satelite channels from many countries - and the latest businesswires.The breakfast decent - but I would strongly advise anyone to stay away from the hotels restaurant. Overall I feel that the value of what one gets is good compared to the price paid. There is simply nothing of interest around it and food is a long long way away!

Overall I had noticed most Barcelona hotels rated as expensive and noisy and to get a quiet hotel at a reasonable rate I thought this would be a good area to stay in. These conclusions were correct and overall I was very happy with the stay. In addition I noted that the hotel was newly built so concluded it should be in good shape. Some problems noted in other reviews about finding the place were blown away by having printed a page with a map and an address and also by the cab driver entering all into a talking GPS unit. We got there from the airport for 18 Euros, which considering that the price to -leave- the airport in a taxi at BCN is already 15 Euros, did not seem bad. We could actually see the tower from our room but the actual distance to the airport is several km in a straight line and that is perpendicular to the runways, so there was no noticable airport noise. Getting into town on busses was quite straightforward and took 20 min to 1/2 hour to Placa d'Espanya, which is in the western part. Other parts of Barcelona are readily accessbile from that major square. We also went back to the airport with a bus/train combination but due to construction it would likely be hard to get to this hotel initially that way. The buffet was pretty good, especially for the reasonable price. It varies from night to night a bit and so did whether they ran out of food etc. The first night, a very pleasant surprise, the next, less so. The breakfast buffet was good except, as we found at other places in Spain, their idea of coffee is a bit different from ours. I would rate this property highly and we got a good intro to Barcelona at a reasonable price, with quiet nights of rest far from the bustle. The neighborhood seems safe enough but I could relate to a display at a museum lamenting the lack of urban planning in the surroundings of Barcelona - it is a distinctly charmless area mainly made up of warehouses and car dealerships! If looking for a bit of food variety, there is a McD next door and if walking a bit further, restaurants in the bedroom/working class community of Viladecans.", "Date": "March 20, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Ibis Barcelona Viladecans", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d639642-Reviews-Ibis_Barcelona_Viladecans-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$77 - $86*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Carrretera de Barcelona 84</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Viladecans</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08840</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "639642", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/e9/ed/e9edcf0d26e57b780c31dbc643d794521large.jpg"}}
