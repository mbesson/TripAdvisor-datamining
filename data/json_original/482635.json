Once we found the buzzer by the closed door we were directed to reception on the 2nd floor - we chose not to use the lift as it looked dangerous. We were disppointed to find the facilities in our room did not match those on the confirmation printout - we certainly DID NOT have the Alarm Clock, CD Player, DVD Player, Flat Screen TV, Slippers or MP3 Player listed. And our fridge was not working, and the shrug of the shoulders that we were given when we pointed this out did not stop our food going off. The staff ranged from good to useless, depending on who was on duty. The breakfast was the worst we came across in Italy, being a very limited choice and stale. The breakfast room itself was tiny, and sitting down and getting things to eat was an awkward exercise even if you could find an empty table. The luggage room did not exist - we left our bags in the corridor beside the reception desk, along with several other guests. We tried to use the PC in the lobby to check in onine for our return flight, but the internet would not connect - the staff member on duty was watching cricket on the hotel PC at the time, so this may have had something to do with it. Again the response was a shrug of the shoulders. The bed was one of the most uncomfortable we came across during our travel through Italy. On the plus side, our room was a good size, with large windows which opened onto the street below, and it was clean. The hotel was convenient for sightseeing, though it was a reasonable walk to The Vatican City, etc. But there was plenty to look at on the way. We stayed for three nights, which we had pre-paid, but would have rather paid a little more to get the facilities as advertised, and listed on our confirmation, somewhere else.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Quincy, Massachusetts, United States", "Title": "\u201cPLEASE don't waste your money\u201d", "Author": "Kyle R", "ReviewID": "UR122795972", "Content": "This hotel wasn't within walking distance of any of the tourist attractions.

The rooms are quite nice, quite spacious for rome, with a minibar which is very handy to put some food and drinks in, aircon, fairly new bathrooms (at times a bit smelly due to the sewer gas). But don't expect a room with a view coz the only view you will get is a brick wall! The service though very disappointing.. most of the staff is quite rude and makes you feel like you are quite an inconvenience. The worst experience we had was on the last day when we had to check out. There was the cleaning/breakfast lady at the check in desk and when it was time to pay I am not sure she had any idea of how to use to FPOS machine and just kept on swearing and punching in numbers and swiping our credit cards very impatiently on 3 different machines about 10 times and nothing was working.. she kept on blaming it on the \"busy lines\". We got very frustrated as we were getting quite worried that our cards where getting charged every time they where swiped.. we asked if someone else that worked there could try and when finally someone else came he processed the payment and it worked on the first go.. obviously the lady was doing something wrong but would not admit it and kept on blaming the lines. I thought she was very unprofessional. Breakfast is also a big disappointment, very basic with little or no food, stale bread and pastries, and the breakfast rooms is way to small first of all and people are left outside at reception waiting for a table to clear. The hotels location is ok, theres a bakery at the front which can make fresh sandwiches and a nice little restaurant next door, but its also a bit of a walk from the main sites, definitely worth paying a bit more and staying somewhere more central.

It was actually 3 nights however because the first night we had to go round the corner to another (2*) hotel because of 'plumbing problems' in the room, albeit this was handled very well with minimal fuss and we weren't too bothered about it. Then coming to stay in the hotel Invictus, the initial impression of the room was a good one, it seemed very clean with some natural light in from the window and was adequate for our needs. We only really wanted somewhere to get some sleep inbetween exploring the fabulous city outside! However, we did have a few issues with the hotel, on the first morning there we went to breakfast (as it was included when we booked online), there was a little bread, a small packet of french toast with some butter and small sachets of jam and the suggestion of there having been cereal earlier on. We sat down in the noisy and small breakfast room but was ignored by the staff. In the end we decided not to bother and left to seek something to eat on-the-go. According to the hotel if we had wanted to pay for the breakfast (if it was not included) this would have cost us about 7 euros per person! - definitely not worth the money in my opinion - instead go to the panini shop over the road! Couple of points about the room itself, the shower was good but seemed to be lacking a door - resulting in quite a lot of water on the bathroom floor, also the TV worked but had no English language channels whatsoever (the 2* hotel did have BBC world news). The quality of sleep I had at this hotel was regrettably poor, the pillows were flat and provided little support and there was no duvet, just a sheet and a rather thin blanket. We had to have the noisy heater on all night to prevent from waking up with the cold! As well as this the street noise with the window shut was still very loud and disturbed our sleep in the mornings, some double glazing would have been much appreciated.

You have to ring the front desk just to get into the building, the elevator is \"shaky\" at best, and the computer in the hallway didn't even work.

We were forced to run the water all night just to be able to stay in the room. The hotel staff did not accomodate our needs and blamed it on the old building. The AC didn't work the whole trip and the TV wouldn't until the rude Indian guy finally came up to the room to troubleshoot the problem. The room did not have hangers to hang our clothes and the cleaning staff did not always bring fresh towels when they made up the room.

Our credit card company are currently investigating the hotel for fraud (in other words, they made it clear to us that there are a number of cases pending on this hotel)...
