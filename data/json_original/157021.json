You will not stay here if the room is a priority. They are very small, but we knew that. There is not any place to put your clothing, so don't expect to unpack, except to hang up a few things. But we still love this place. It is located right on the beach, or what's left of the beach. They have had some erosion. The beach was crowded on the weekend, but not so during the week. The food is good, and the service is quite nice. Often there is live music. As for the room, ours was updated from prior visits. It was obvious some changes had occurred. A new roof. A new air conditioner. A hair drier. A new flat screen TV with lots of channels for everyone who goes to Playa Del Carmen to watch TV. One thing that was not as good as in the past was the water pressure. Very, very low. And at one point, no pressure at all. But corrected within minutes after our reporting it to the front desk. Then we had our trickle again. But we certainly got HOT water after several minutes. And the room was quiet. You are also located just one block from 5th avenue, where most of the action occurs regarding restaurants and shopping. There is a lot of energy on 5th Ave. It reminds me of going to Disney World and spending time in one of their villages or countries. And you are only about 2 blocks from the bus station, so taking the bus from the airport is also inexpensive and convenient. (Tip: for a good meal for peanuts go to the restaurant on the beach on 2'nd street. The Fusion is on the beach at 6th street. That's 2 blocks). This is probably the only place you can find like this in Playa. What would have been the competition have been bought up and are now new condo's. We've never known anyone who stayed there that didn't like it. And this year it was like old home week. We saw quite a few people staying there who had stayed there when we had in past trips. We rated it excellent for what it was.

We have ate at their outside restaurant and found the atmosphere amazing. We were greeted by the nicest woman and told our room would be ready in 10 minutes, We also were given a coupon for a free cocktail for myself and husband and a free beverage for my daughter at their restaurant while we waited. When we arrived at the room there was a nice flat screen on the wall. The beds were very comfortable but upon inspection we were unhappy with the condition of things and asked to move or upgrade rooms. There was mold and mildew, badly stained curtains, rotting wood and walls, The lady told us that there might be an upgrade to an ocean view room, but they were waiting to see if the party were going to cancel. The upgrade cost was to be almost double what we paid, but that was ok us. What really really bothered us was when we tried to sit outside with our daughter at an open table that night they told us that we could not because it was turning into a bar. Understandable, adults at night want to put their feet in the sand, have a drink, and listen to a good band, so we went inside for a table. The lady told us she would have to ask a manager, even though there were open tables not at the bar area. We told her we were staying at the hotel...but still she would have to ask. She was rude and rolled her eyes as if we were inconveniencing her. We passed and took our money elsewhere. The water stayed warm for 30 seconds in the shower regardless of what time we tried to shower. Their free breakfast was ok, though we were never provided coffee refills or juice refills for our daughter. The beach section isn't the best, but that's not their fault. You just walk a ways down and it's perfect. Like I said, we really wanted to like this hotel, but it's NOT kid friendly or at least they were not friendly to us. The layout is cute and all the plants are wonderful, but it needs a lot of TLC and people who care about it. I wish we had a different experience because it's location is perfect! If you are looking for a beachfront hotel and don't have kids and aren't expecting too much, this hotel will do...but not for us, ever again...and that goes for the restaurant too, unfortunately.", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, MN", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location and atmosphere for the right travelers.\u201d", "Author": "markmayster", "ReviewID": "UR124178762", "Content": "The first time my wife and I visited Playa del Carmen we stayed in a large, all-inclusive resort...and quickly learned that wasn't our style. What we learned we really wanted was the freedom of a smaller boutique hotel centrally located in town where shopping, local dining options and atmosphere were within arm's reach. Fusion is the perfect answer if this is what you're looking for and don't put great focus on the amenities of the actual room. My wife and just need a place to sleep and spend most of the day exploring or on the beach which is in Fusion's back yard. The rooms are clean and no-frills is a fair description but only for the rooms; the rest of the hotel offers plenty of frills. We had no problems at all with noise. Fusion's best asset is the staff who were helpful in every aspect, even prior to our leaving the States. But beyond that, Fusion offers amazing food and stunning views of the ocean in an open-air bar and also has hands-down the best beach-side dining in Playa. Each night guests are treated to live entertainment as they sit at candlelit tables and watch the sunset. Truly priceless if you're into that kind of thing. And don't just take my word for it, Fusion is THE hotspot with the tables filling up nightly. Be sure to have the breakfast special and a massage on the patio. Not at the same time, though, as that might be weird. While it may not be ideal for every situation it is certainly more than ideal for the romantic, adventurous solo traveler or couple.

Located right off of famous 5th ave, complete with a great casual beach club on site with excellent service! My husband and I stayed over the holidays so it was definitely pricier than the off season rates where I think then, anyone would feel this is a sweet find deal during those times, we payed holiday rates and that was common for all the hotels during those dates. Ah well, I still really enjoyed the cozy colorful room with a pillowtop bed and basic shower was all just fine for us. We wanted to stay near the beach and in downtown over the NYE so this hotel was truly perfect for us. The front staff was friendly and offered a welcome drink our first day and we had the free continental bfast daily which was a simple but a nice start to each day. By day here, we really liked that we were close to bus station to head to Tulum and Coba Mayan Ruins, or many other excursion meet ups or we would just stay at the hotel beach club utilizing the free towels and lounge chairs which Fusion provided. At night there are so many places to head out for dinner along 5th ave, the location really is great for evening walks on the beach or on the ave, we generally would make a circle nightly, always opting to beach walk home to our lovely hotel at night after dinner. If you don't feel like walking just sit at a table in the sand at the Fusion lounge, they have really great food here too. We loved the live music and fireshow entertainment happenings out on the beach in front of the hotel at night and by day the vibe was chill and relaxing.. I recommend the Fusion for those that do not stay in their room much and are more concerned about Location Location.. rather than a pampered luxury style room. Also note yep, as noted.. the hotel has live music at night so if you are one that goes to sleep early this spot may not be for you, there are rooms in the garden area that seem a lil quieter but don't count on it. ;) We had no issues with the noise in the garden after around 2a. When we did have one issue at the hotel the staff was quick to resolve the issue, showing great customer service!

However, I made my reservation for the next night and enjoyed an ocean view table in the sand the second night of our stay.

The hotel also is located right in the center of Playa, which makes walking the famous 5th Ave. really fun and easy. It's a trendy hotel and bar/grill, so live music plays well into the wee hours of the morning. If you like to party until you pass out, Fusion is perfect. If you need to get shut-eye for all-day excursions, you might want to find a different hotel. The room: Our traveling party included two adults and two children, so we needed a room with two beds. The only rooms with two beds are located WAY in the back of the little complex. The room we had was the basic of the basics. It had two double beds, the smallest dorm fridge you can buy, a nightstand, a bathroom with walk-in shower, a TV with cable service and a single air conditioning unit that made the room either too cold or too hot. We had a window opened in the bedroom and a small window in the shower stall. There was no balcony, which made it impossible to hang dry wet swimsuits/clothes. Getting into a cold, wet swimming suit was the pits. The room was a \"Garden View,\" but there wasn't much to see out our window -- a tree and some green ground foliage. Maid service was excellent, and we tipped accordingly. PLEASE TAKE NOTE: THERE ARE NO IN-ROOM SAFES!! The reception desk says they have a safe, but when we went to place my laptop and our passports, we found the laptop did not fit under the desk. There really is no safe at the reception desk: They put your stuff in envelope and write your room number on it. When we retrieved our passports, we were not asked for any ID or anything, so we didn't feel safe leaving anything at the reception desk. So if you have a laptop, passports or any other valuable items, you must either leave them in your room or keep them with you at all times. This made our trip troublesome because I was so afraid someone would come in our room and steal our stuff when we participated in water sports and other activities. If you are looking for a place to just sleep and shower, Fusion is the best place to be. It's like a Motel 6 or Super 8 on the beach. It was fine for us because we spent nearly all our time on the beach or participating in water sports and sightseeing. If you are looking for an up-scale boutique resort feel, you should stay elsewhere. There is no swimming pool, no hot tub or any of the extras. The restaurant/bar: Fusion's food/drinks and service were really good, but very pricey compared to other places -- even within the tourist zone. If you venture two blocks north of 5th Ave., you can find local food vendors, where you can get a ton a food for just USD $3 or $4/person. We ended up walking to Walmart and stocking up on snacks, soda, bottled water and beer and just taking that to the beach with us. It was much, much cheaper than ordering everything from Fusion's restaurant. Presentation Scams: Everywhere you go in Mexico, many, many people will offer you free tickets to parks and even money if you go to some presentation at a \"new\" hotel resort. These people will try to stop you at the airport, while your walking down 5th Ave., and even in Walmart. Unless you intend to spend $28,000 on a resort room time-share-like program, just ignore these people and keep walking. The presentations take about 2-3 hours, and you get pressured into investing into a resort. While the free ticket offers may sound tempting, it really isn't worth it unless you have nothing better to do than sit in sales presentations during your entire vacation. Bottomline: If you have off-site activities planned, Fusion is a great basic place to rest your head. If you want to stay put and relax with some extras and a little pampering, Fusion is not for you. The only caveat: THERE ARE NO SAFES FOR VALUABLES.", "Date": "December 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxnard California", "Title": "\u201cOn the Beach in Playa Del Carmen\u201d", "Author": "BigJuanJohn", "ReviewID": "UR121250279", "Content": "This beach is just off 6th street on the beach.

I recommend you place your towel to save your place on the lounge chairs at the time you go to breakfast or else you might not get one of the good viewing spots (you know, for people watching).

We loved the fish ajillo and ceviche. For breakfast, eggs motulenos is a must. Expect higher prices though; especially for the drinks. They have great bands playing every day and a very impressive firedancing/drumming show later on. We had a room overlooking the beach which was amazing. However, don't expect any sort of quiet as the music from the live bands is very loud on this side. Even earplugs couldn't drown it out. It's a worthy sacrifice to make if you're that kind of person.

We got in around 7pm and the party was in full swing. Our check-in was easy (I had booked through Hotels.com) and within minutes we were lugging our stuff up 3 flights of stairs and basking in the happiness of \"we are here\". The room had a great set-up and we were ocean-front. Nice size bathroom, sitting area, closet and fridge. The patio was just the perfect size for the table and 2 chairs. The AC definitely works well here - and after the 1st night found that we didn't quite need it as low as we thought. There is only the sheet and a thin blanket on the bed, I'm sure if we had asked we could have gotten another but we just turned up the AC and were fine. My mom said the bed was a little too hard for her liking, but I personally had no problems with it. We did have a couple of little hiccups but nothing a good drink didn't fix. On our first day, we came back from breakfast and were changing to go to the beach. I was going to make a quick bathroom run before we headed out but that turned into 20 minutes stuck inside the BR while my mom tried getting me out, failed, and had to run downstairs to get someome to come get me out. I don't know what he did - but he got me out. Our fix for that: Mom and I never shut the BR door again! We laughed that it could only happen to one of us. Another hiccup was the shower. I think the shower head just needs a good cleanig with some CLR and it would be fine - but it sprayed EVERYWHERE. The entire BR floor would be soaked after we would get cleaned up. I mentioned this to them as we were leaving b/c really it wasn't THAT big of a deal, but something they should look into. Last hiccup was the toilet, and this I don't believe is the hotel's fault. We had several days where we thought our toilet was clogging, but when we mentioned it to the front desk they said the water had been off in the area. So our belief is that was going on each time. No biggie, it would right itself throughout the day. The shows at Fusion are as spectacular as everyone says. We loved the bands and the belly dancers each evening. The fire show was a big hit as well. The only thing I didn't really like - and maybe it's just me - but after the belly dancer would perform she would walk around and ask for tips. I just didn't like feeling put on the spot. If she had just set the jar next to the stage it would have been fine. Some have complained of the noise associated with the beach front rooms during the evening shows but we had no problems. We slept great every night we were there. The beach in front of the hotel is fantastic and we loved it everyday. It's a great mix of locals and tourists and the noise level is fine, the atmosphere is one of just fun. Also, they have massages set up on the stage during the day. The food at Fusion is great and we ate there twice. The food prices aren't bad, but the drink prices seemed high. Our tab for one order of nachos and 6 drinks was $100 US one day - that just seemed high to me. The location for Fusion is great. It's right off 5th Ave. and beach front. You can't get any better than that. We loved walking so much and having so much to do right near us. It was great. All in all we really liked the Fusion Hotel and would definitely recommend it to anyone that asked - as a matter of fact I think a friend has already booked for later this year.

This hotel is a must visit! The owners were on the property all the time, property very well maintained and lots to do in the evening right at the hotel.

As other\u2019s have said the hotel is pretty basic and after reading other reviews I realized all of the rooms are upgraded differently. We had the two story room thus we had had two televisions; though neither was a flat screen and also one of the following reviews said they had only one towel and no hair dryer. We had a ton of towels daily and there was definitely a hair dryer hanging. Either way, on to my review: We thoroughly enjoyed Fusion. You cannot beat free breakfast, and two for one mimosas, right on the beach every morning. The location is ideal being that you are right off of 5th Avenue, close to a million restaurants and Playa\u2019s nightlife. I will say beware of how loud Fusion can be. For us, the band playing at night was no problem because we were often in the crowd enjoying the band; and by the time you get back to Fusion, after a night of clubbing, Fusion has long shut down. However, I must note that the walls are just really thin in the rooms. You can hear people walking by and if they are standing in your room. It didn\u2019t really bother me, but it is something I took note of. Beyond that the beach is great. Of course you get special service since you are staying at the hotel and it\u2019s a great place to hang out for the day. I must say we did have a problem with the restaurant though. I ordered a drink, from the menu, that when I tasted did not like. I sent it back immediately (I only took two sips) and wanted to replace the drink. It took us over 35 minutes to get them to replace the drink. They kept saying that even though I didn\u2019t like the drink that I would still have to pay for it. Which was ridiculous. Finally, the manager made a rude comment stating that she didn\u2019t want \u201cany more trouble\u201d from us so she would just replace the drink (you would think I had asked for my money back, I simply wanted a new drink!) Since that\u2019s all we were asking for in the first place we said thank you but I was irritated at the implication that WE were troublemakers over something so minor. We did move on from that day and continued to enjoy the restaurant. Other short notes: The front desk personnel are great; they gave us the great idea to travel to Isla Mujueres for the day and we LOVED it. We are definitely going back there. The room was basic, but clean. We had a problem with our air conditioner the first day and it was fixed immediately. The cleaning people were great and thorough.

I had stayed at another hotel (very basic with very low rates) for the first week of my stay in Playa but ended up discovering Fusion so I decided to switch for my second week. At the time (April 2010), the owner offered a discount as I was staying longer than 5 days (and maybe also because I was also traveling alone?). I ended up paying around $60.US/night. I was excited about staying there again this year but was very disappointed to find out the rate was to be $1700. for 16 nights...! and no discount! I was told they had a discount at $67.50 a few months back but that discount didn't apply at the time of my traveling. I know it's not terribly expensive when you think this hotel is located directly on the beach, close to everything, offers great affordable beach massages, excellent food and great entertainment during the day and at night. The rooms are clean but basic and some can be quite noisy if you're a light sleeper. I was quite suprised they no longer offered any kind of discount as most hotels (even some of the smallest ones) in Playa will offer a discount if you're staying 7 days or more...So, I ended up booking somewhere else, a smaller hotel (with great reviews), less than one block to the beach, a tiny walking distance to the 5th Ave, with a pool and a kitchenette for $67./night including taxes and the promo discount. So, as much as I loved Fusion, I'm happy to see that there are other nice friendly hotels in Playa who will take into consideration you're staying for a longer period of time and offer a discount!

It has a really good feel about it which can only be understood once you have stayed there - so get booked up.....! The rooms are quite basic compared to large resorts, however they get the basics right. Good comfortable beds, lots of storage space, efficient air conditioning and large ceiling fan, good shower and as mentioned in other reviews, a large fridge which was very useful. It's only a 25 metre walk to the beach so you are hardly going to spend much time in there anyway, otherwise you might as well stay at home. The food is very good at the Fusion, all freshly prepared and the service was fantastic. There is waiter service during the day and in the evening on the beach and you would never have to wait any longer than 5 mins for a waiter to pass and get their attention. We ate at 2 restaurants on 5th Avenue (the main drag for restaurants/bars/shops) but were never as satisfied as we were when we ate at the hotel. We would especially recommend the Quesidillas and Calamari. Add to this the great nightly entertainment on offer and you will see just how much more value you get for your money than staying in a large \"sterile\" resort. Also, WIFI available in the reception area if you need to stay in contact with the world. Getting to the hotel from Cancun airport we got a coach. We used ADO (their desk is on the left as you exit customs) and their coaches leave every 30-45mins. It cost $18 each return, the coach was air conditioned, showed movies and took about an hour to get to PDC. The hotel is a 5 min walk from the bus station. It was a very smooth journey.

The hotel is directly in front of the water and conveniently the city 're-did' the beaches in some areas so there was over 200 feet for gorgeous white sand to lounge in. All of the staff members, including waitresses and bartenders, were very helpful and spoke English well. The location is fabulous. One street away from 5th avenue, we walked everywhere. We also booked a few day trips, many of which we were picked up at the hotel instead of having to take public transportation. Again, the staff were helpful in suggesting different day trips and excursions. The rooms are what you pay for. As you can read in many of the reviews, they are simple. When we arrived, we checked into room 12 (a 'garden' room) at the price of $90 a night. Unfortunately this room is in the middle of the hotel, almost all of the other guests have to walk past this room to get to theirs. There is a lot of foot traffic, not to mention the very loud bands that play past midnight many evenings. Perhaps I was naive in thinking we would get a nice, quiet room by the beach for such a cheap price. We spoke with the woman at the front desk and upgraded to room 19 (the owners usual room). My boyfriend paid for the upgrade, so I am not sure what it cost, but it was well worth it. Room 19 has a balcony looking out to the ocean, a HUGE bed, beautiful wood ceiling, but it also very loud. Moral of the story... the music is amazing when you want to be awake and listening, but not when you need to sleep because you are getting up early to tour the Mayan ruins. Bring ear plugs!

First the good: great location, beautiful beach, pretty good food although the continental breakfast is the same every day and not that great. Beds weren't great but not awful either.The hightlight was the harp player that played during the breakfast hour - incredible! Unfortunately, for us, the bad out weighed the good. Our first two nights were in a tiny \"garden view\" (there was no view of the garden - the \"balcony\" overlooked the road outside and the window overlooked an airconditioning unit on top of the roof) room. It was basically a backpacker hostel type of room - grimy feeling (a wad of gum on one of the walls!) and stunk like sewer. I could have maybe overlooked the room quality if it werent so loud - between the band playing until after midnight, the partiers leaving the bar area and the noise from the street, even with ear plugs we got no sleep. After two nights we were moved to another room which was equally grimy (almost all the walls were scuffed up like someone had thrown dirty shoes against them) but was slightly quieter. We were only able to stay in that room for 4 nights and would then have to move another 2 times during our 9 night stay, so we found another hotel a block away - absolutely lovely, clean, great bed, quiet AND $20 night less. My impression is that the management/owners are making their money from the restaurant and bar and don't really care about the hotel. Yes, the location is great, but so are many places. I guess if you have low expectations around cleanliness and quiet you won't be disappointed, but we just expected so much more than we got.", "Date": "February 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Mexico", "Title": "\u201cGreat People, Great Location!\u201d", "Author": "NewMexicoTandT", "ReviewID": "UR54776560", "Content": "We stayed at Fusion for 11 days in January in a \"garden room\" (#3). We asked for one of the quieter rooms due to the reviews that said it could be noisy there because of the nightly live music. We couldn't hear much of the music sounds from the room but could occassionally hear things from the 5th Avenue--it wasn't bad at all, and with the A/C on, it covered noises nicely. We will stay here again. The people working at this place are super accommodating. Beds in Mexico can be on the very \"firm\" side and ours was here. So, because of a bad back, we mentioned it to the front desk people and they had the maids put some extra padding on the bed which helped immensely. About halfway through our stay the rooms ALL got new mattresses and they were much better! The room was pretty spacious and had high ceilings. The garden is really beautiful and a pleasure to step out into, although I imagine if you aren't concerned about the noise, waking up to the ocean view would be even better! This hotel is ON the beach, and its a nice beach. While we were there, some heavy equipment came through that was working on making the beach bigger as it had eroded away from the hurricane 2 years ago. It closed our beach for 4 days or so which was a bummer, but there was no way the staff could have known it was going to happen. It was quite an interesting show to watch--a big ship was sucking sand off the bottom of the ocean and pumping it through huge pipes to the beaches and then big machinery spread and leveled it. We did get a discount because of the beach closure, which was nice and helped pay for the cost of going to the other beach clubs during those days. There is a restaurant and bar here too. It's funky and perfect. Open air dining, bright colorful lights at night. We ate at many places on 5th Avenue since we were there 11 days, and in all honesty, the food was the best right there at the Fusion Hotel. And it was cheaper than many of the places we ate. The drinks were also great and the live music was festive and mostly really good! Love the reggae and the drumming! The fire show at night was definitely worth seeing too. We were impressed by the bus system for getting around. You can take the ADO bus from Cancun to the Juarez and 5th Ave station for like $10 and once there, there are these guys on tricycles and its about $3 to have them carry you and your luggage to the hotel, (but these guys don't speak much English, so write the name of your hotel for them...we said \"Fusion\", he understood \"Fisherman\" and we ended up at the wrong place when we got there!) Going back to the station when leaving, we just walked (our luggage had wheels) to the bus station. It's only a few blocks and we shopped 5th Avenue on the way. We also took the ADO to Tulum one day and to Xcaret another day. It was easy and cheap and very comfortable. If you're on a budget, don't hesitate to take it. We took the Collectivo a couple of times too and that is a fine way to travel as well, but if you'd rather, the taxi's are EVERYWHERE. One other point, if you go to this area, do not miss Xcaret, and try to allow 2 days for it. We went one day and didn't get to see everything. This place is amazing...underground river and cave snorkeling, gorgeous beach to hang out on, hammocks, swim with dolphins, see the sea turtles, butterflies, parrots, all kinds of animals, horse show...I can't even tell you everything because there is so much. But at night there is a Grand Spectacular--you go to a beautiful theatre where they reenact the ball games of the Mayans among other things, but this was so incredible that you just have to see it to believe it. We also went to Chichen Itza on a guided tour which included stopping and getting into a Cenote on the way back, and that was one of the coolest things! It was stunningly beautiful and very refreshing! OK, back to the Fusion Hotel...we recommend staying here.

Live nightly entertainment, right on the beach, close to 5th Ave and the reviews I read were good. We knew that we would sacrifice amenities due to the location vs the price and had seen an online photo of one of the rooms so we knew that they were sparsely furnished. First let me say that the restaurant, food, atmosphere, and all of the staff were very nice and helpful. The rooms on the other hand were not. Our first room, # 13, was not far from the lobby (or the band). It was very small, only walkways around the bed. The view out our window looked into an outside storage closet and general storage area, the shower dripped nonstop all day and night and had been doing so for a long time as the shower floor was stained. The soap dish in the shower had a hole in the bottom so the soap would drop through to the floor, all tile was in need of work. Not only did we hear the band from inside our room while they were playing, but we were also able to hear them chatting outside our door as they picked up their things at the end of their night, as they had stored them just outside our door. The next day we decided to find lodging elsewhere, but ended up staying when offered compensation and were moved upgraded room, #25. It was a larger room with a garden view, farther from the lobby. It was an improvement. As we settled into the room we noticed that the bathroom light didn't work so we reported it. By 7 PM, when we returned, we still had no lights. Reported it again, grabbed a bite to eat and came back to find a green shaded desk lamp that was plugged into the bathroom outlet which is located outside of the bathroom on the left side of the doorway and the lamp was placed inside the bathroom, on the sink top , which is on the right side of the room. This meant that the lamp cord ran across the doorway just below shoulder level. With our new lighting we were now able to see that there were no towel bars, just large patches of non sanded Spackle where a towel bar once was, similar patches around the shower faucets, all sorts of small holes in the tile above the sink and lots of \"stuff\" on the tile walls under the sink and at that level all around the bathroom in general. At this distance you could still hear the band at night. I think that this hotel would be best enjoyed by a younger (or not so young), party crowd type person, that enjoys a very laid back atmosphere with good (and loud) nightly entertainment.

Here's what we thought: Location: Great...right on the beach, 30 seconds from the main area (most people want this...though it is super touristy), 3 blocks from the convenient bus stop. Beach: really nice. Unfortunately for our entire stay, there was construction on the beach to make it wider, and you were not allowed to be on it except for at night. NOT the hotel's fault, but the whole point of the stay was to be on the beach. Instead we went to a beach club/hotel in Tulum for a day to enjoy the beach and peace of quiet there. (Om beach club and cabanas....highly reccomend) Had we known, we would have gone elsewhere. The hotel does get bonus points for discounting our room without us asking. ($20 discount per night). Rooms: Meh. We stayed in a \"partial ocean view\"...we wanted an ocean room, but there are only 2, and none were available. When we arrived, the ocean view room on the top floor was open and we got a peek. It looked really nice...large fridge, huge TV, amazing view. We stayed in the room across the hall.....$30 less, but not comparable. A small, filthy TV (but with good english channel selection), a small balcony with VERY partial view of the ocean (ocean could only be seen from the balcony, and only for the one third of the balcony), otherwise the room looked onto the restaurant below. A.C. didn't work well, shower knobs were broken, screen in shower was broken and made an irritating loud noise till we stuffed tissue in between. Small fridge. Room was generally a little run down and wasn't worth the extra $$ for partial view, however after peeking at some of the garden rooms, I think ours was one of the nicer ones. If you MUST stay here, I wouldn't do it unless you can get the nice ocean front. The kicker was how loud the room was. I admit that after reading reviews I knew there was going to be some noise from the bar and live bands, but even with earplugs, it didn't come close to blocking the sound. No biggie as we were told there was live music until midnight which is a reasonable hour, but the bands played until 2 am on the weekend. Nuff said. Food: The food was average and overpriced for what you are getting.. We ate very well in Playa Del Carmen, and the food in most places is priced around the same as fusion but just better quality, and tastier. Out of 3 attempted meals, the burger was pretty good. If you want great food in Playa, head to Babe's (thai-ish restaurant) on 10th....AMAZING! All in all, this place really just didn't have anything that enamored us. A lot of staff, but no one is all that helpful or friendly, with a few exceptions. Just a generally \"off\" vibe.

Also, our room A/C worked fine and was clean. The frint desk personnel were also very nice and helpful. Now, the bad: Our room (#21) faced the street and loud would be an understatement. There appears to be an after-hours club nearby and the partiers would catch cabs right next to our room starting at 5:00AM. It sounded as though 20 screaming people were in our oom with us from 5-8 AM.

I don\u2019t agree that drinks are overly expensive. Most mixed drinks (margaritas/daiquiris) were 70 pesos, which is 5.32 USD as of now. What\u2019s not to like? We drank mixed drinks and beer all day (beer is cheaper, of course). Beach was decent with enough palapas for hotel guests. Cute beach bar/open air restaurant. Continental breakfast (free with room) was coffee, juice, toast, croissant. They did have a full breakfast menu. I had French toast one day (55 pesos) and it came with a nice assortment of fruit. Two bottles of water provided each day in room. Pretty little courtyard with lots of flowers between rooms. Excellent location \u2013 short walk from ADO bus station, 30 seconds off 5th, right on beach, etc. Live music at night (we only caught it once as we were usually out on 5th), plus a fire show each night (we saw it once. Fun). And can\u2019t beat the price. I have never stayed in such a small, inexpensive place, and yes, I would stay there again. No question. There are other places with nicer rooms, for more money, of course. I prefer the beach location in order to sacrifice room amenities.

During my last visit , though, I realized that I was describing the setting of the hotel and restaurant . The review might have been misleading to the readers. I neglected to relay my feelings about being a guest in the hotel. If I were the owner, of Fusion,I would strive to have my guests describe my rooms as fun- or funky- ot full of atmosphere. I would not want to offer rooms that were described on this site as a step above a hostel- or very ,very basic. The rooms just don't match the restaurant. we're not talking fancy here,..we don't want or need fancy. Just a coat of inexpensive paint in a vibrant color might bring a different feel. If I were the owner, I would also want my hotel guests to feel welcomed and informed. If there are any surprises to be had , they would be good surprises. We have all read on this site that the guests are required to leave their beach chairs at around 3:00. If the guests want to sit on a chair, they have to move to the restaurant chairs. Even though I was aware of this fact on both visits(only because of tripadvisor), I was still shocked and felt somwhat embarrased. The employees are instructed to inform guests of this policy as they literally take the chairs away.When I got up for a moment to, grab a hat that blew away, my items were moved from my chair and the chair was swept away. When I told the employee that I was still using the chair, he said \"no\". Most of the guests stood in shock. It would seem to me that a simple note to guests would offer more respect. Something like \"Our beautiful beach turns into a wonderful lounge at 3:00. Guests will be asked to move to restaurant chairs at that time\" could be posted in the hotel lobby. Seems easy to me. A full blown offer of respect would include the same posting on the website so guests would be aware before choosing the hotel..( If you check in at 3:00--there will be no lounging on the beach.) Upon check in I read that 10% would be added to my bill if I charged food items to my room. When I asked if that would be considerd the tip, I was told that they don't really charge the 10%. I wondered why they didn't take that statement off the form. When I asked if I would be charged extra if I payed with a credit card, I was told yes -(but I had to ask ). When I checked in, I was told that my arranged transportation (by the hotel) company was going to charge me more than the agreed upon amount. If I wanted to dispute it I had to wait to speak to the Fusion employee who arranged my transportation for me. When I spoke to that person the next day, she definately agreed that our original rate was correct, but I wondered why I needed to be the one to speak to her. We had tons of emails with the agreed upon amount. All of that said, I believe we will try the hotel again. I know that we will vist the restaurant. I would have been happy to write all of these thoughts on a suggestion form supplied by the hotel instead of on tripadvisor. But, there was no request for guest input.

You will not be allowed to get a beach chair after 3pm and don't expect to be able to sit anywhere in the upstairs bar area - except the small lobby area - without ordering drinks/food- even if the place is nearly empty!!! This treatment was very disappointing and unlike anything that we have experienced in any of our 4 trips to Mexico. Basically as a guest of the hotel only entitles you to use of the room and nothing else. You'd be better off staying elsewhere and come down for a drink or a bite to eat. Given our shabby treatment, we chose to drink and eat elsewhere so I can't comment on food and drink quality.

My husband and I only spent one night at this colorful hotel in May 2007, but it was a very fun evening. We didn't have a reservation, but were able to just walk in and book a room. We were guided through a flower maze to our second story room. The rooms are basic, but clean (with air conditioning, t.v. and refrigerator). They do accept credit cards and when I got my statement I was charge $74 - we felt this was a very fair price. The bed wasn't very comfortable, but after a hot day in the sun I didn't lose any sleep over it. The hotel has an ideal location - right on the beach and only feet from 5th Ave. After spending some time people watching on 5th we came back to Fusion for drinks and dinner; music was also on the menu. A band playing covers of musicians such as Jimmy Buffet, the Rolling Stones and Bob Marley was first up and we were entertained by a little girl who felt the need to dance expressivvely to all their groovy tunes. A French couple was up next and they sang folky songs in French while we sipped mojitos and ate fish tacos. The drinks were pretty good, not terribly strong, and the fish tacos were just okay, but nothing was very expensive and the atmosphere was fun and laid back ($4.50 per drink). The service was very good. The clientele was mostly Italian or French on the night we were there; with the exception of one or two other American couples. We enjoyed the in-house dog, Libi. The next morning we had a big basket of assorted breads and orange juice (complimentary with your stay) while watching the sun rise over the Caribbean. We would most definitely stay at Fusion again.

The hotel is run down but has a prime location. The rooms are spartan, the a/c was loud and we had a few guests (ants). But overall, we were not disappointed! It was our first visit to Playa del Carmen, but we had visited Puerto Vallarta a dozen times. In Mexico, the people are wonderful and hard working. There is a different standard here - you have to roll with things! At $76 per night, you cannot expect perfection - we didn't and were not disappointed. Check in was slightly confusing and we were told the rate promised was incorrect - but the young woman was very polite and told us that the person in charge would be available in an hour and she was. No need to riled up - we were on vacation!Our garden room with king size bed was delivered as requested. We checked out the night before leaving to avoid any issues, even though our flight was at noon. We stayed in room 4, on the second floor in the garden area. I was amazed by how private and quiet the room was. The gardens are beautiful. The hot water and shower was adequate. The room needs an overhaul. The ceiling fan was hanging by a wire, outlets were loose, no drawers for our clothes. But again, $76 a night on the ocean. It was clean with a good shower! No toilet issues either! I was not overly impressed with the beach in Playa del Carmen. The hotel beach was no worse (or better) than any other beach in the area. I prefer the beach in Vallarta, but it is a much longer commute - a trade off. The water was calmer and warmer in PDC - that was a plus! The continental breakfast was meager but free! Coffee was excellent. The staff was polite. The first day, I ordered a marguerita on the beach and was disappointed. My second day (3rd, 4th & 5th), I ordered my marguerita at the end of the day at the bar. WOW! I was thrilled! Both bartenders knew how to mix a drink! My biggest complaint is the removal of the beach chairs in the afternoon. I come to the beach after 12 and want to stay until sundown everyday. At 3 pm they start to remove the lounges and bring in uncomfortable wooden chairs. By 4 pm, the staff demands that you switch chairs. Whether you are spending money or not! We ordered food and drinks the first day at 3:30 and forced to switch seats before 4 pm. The second day, my partner protested and was told it was policy. The third day and subsequent days we made a point go elsewhere (a few steps down the beach) at 4 pm and spent our money elsewhere in comfort. It really was stupid! There was always open space - bar patrons could have been told the lounges were for hotel guests only. They had no problem telling us to move!

Rooms: Ok..our room was VERY basic, and we wouldn't be honest if we said it doesn't need renovation. We had ants in our room (even though it was 1st floor) and we sealed some holes we found with a toothpaste :) It helped to reduce them for about a half..and the other half left didn't bother as at all! Its Mexico and ants must be there! haha :):) And on the other side.. who spends beautiful Mexinan days in a hotel room?? We were there for 14 nights and the staff only started recognising our faces in the last 3 days, because first 11 days we were spending outside the hotel. Beach: Is absolutely great! not really wide, but you don't need to play volleyball there :) Not overcrowded and you can hear great music in the background.. There is a coral outcrop so you need to walk like 10 meters to get into the water (not 50 meters like I read in one of the reviews!!) The atmosphere, the privacy, the service are all for a big + . Garden: That's something magical about this little place! The gardener does a fantastic job and we are a bit jealous of his georgeous plants :) Staff: very friendly, very helpful. Waiters/waitresses are all young and friendly people. I liked talking to them, and never had any problems with any of them! Room service is also good! Beautiful towel arts! Libby: She's such a lovely darling! Beautiful and probably best fed dog in the whole Yucatan! As we are early birds we were walking on the beach just before the sunrise and she was the only one to join us! Always keen to play and swim. We loved her! Food: Oh yes! We couldn't omit the food! Everything was delicious, the portions are huge (as for us), and we often ended sharing 1 dish :) Our favourites: Fried calamari, Garlic mushrooms, Fruit plate (for breakfast), Fish soup, and all fish dishes were great! The chef does exvellent job!! Please tell him/her that from us!! And the prices are much better than on the 5th. Drinks: I am not a big fan of alcohol, so can't say too much about it. My hubby had only beer (Sol with lime), and I once tried mojitos, which was very tasty and refreshing! But what I really loved was orange juice (no ice :)) and fruit shakes. Overall rating for Fusion is excellent! Their weakest point are the rooms, but I heard that some of them are nicer than the one we had (which didn't bother us).

Set right on the beach, each day can be spent lounging on chairs with umbrellas as one of the MANY friendly faces working the bar/restaurant attend to to your needs with a smile. Great music is piped through the bar throughout the day. Fish tacos for $11? Fabulous! A bucket of beer for $10? Remarkable! Chilled shots of Don Julio Respesado? Get me a salt chaser with lime! The new owners have taken strides to create a fresh vibe with good food, excellent (and free) live music at night and a comfortable atmosphere that welcomes families, couples and singles of all ages. There's not a hint of the MTV spring break madness you'd expect just 40 miles north in Cancun. Playa has more of a Euro-South American feel that makes the simple act of gazing at the \u00c7arribean with a beer and a shot the next best thing to heaven. Much of the staff are college kids from South America--a nice touch by the owners that's easy on the eyes. The girls on the desk are smart and easy on the eyes, too. A decent selection of Cuban cigars are available from a humodor on the bar! Granted, there are minor inconveniences such as the occasional clogged toilet and sparingly decorated rooms but what do you want? The owners address all problems immediately and as best they can considering Mexico is NOT Manhattan (I'm in Manhattan often and things can be just as bad). The scheduled renovation in June I'm told will help address these issues and transform the hotel into more of a semi-boutique oasis than it already is. I only hope the price doesn't skyrocket as affordablility is Fusion's strongest hand and a great compliment to its charm, simplicity and simpatico vibe. If you want five star don't come here.

First off I'll say that if you are a 'resort person' you probably won't find what you are looking for here. If you are looking for a nice, little relaxed and easy going place right on the beach, this is certainly it. This was my fourth trip to Mexico and my girlfriend's first and we both loved it. We booked it online (partially based on the reviews on this site) which means you never really know what you're getting until you arrive, but I can say as soon as we got out of the van and walked into the courtyard we were happy with what we saw. The patio with tables and chairs, the bar, the breeze blowing through, the beach, the water, it was awesome. We stayed two nights in an ocean view room then moved to an ocean front room for the next three. I've been all over the caribbean and can honestly say it was the best room I've had: Nice sized and clean, big doorwall, ceiling fan, big balcony and RIGHT ON the beach and water. We slept with the doorwall open every night and soaked in the early morning sun in bed at 7:30 am. After walking the beach a few times, we didn't see a better room, location-wise. (there were a couple timeshares that had nice balconies) I had to wonder why the room was available, if I go back I'd book far enough in advance to get it again. We arrived at about 3, after checking in we sat down on the beach for a beer. That turned into a few hours and a meal. There was really no reason to budge. The food was great (chicken quesadillas especially) and they had a nice drink menu. Something not a lot of reviewers mentioned was the music. We're both huge music fans so this was a pleasant surprise. Every evening they had a band play a couple sets, then a change over and another band played a couple sets. It was all very good music, from groovy jazzy rock to traditional Mexican music. We stayed around our hotel a good portion of our stay mostly because it suited what we were after: chilling out. The walk to town was all of a block, it was great, we didn't get into a cab or bus or van for the whole trip except for airport transportation. TIP: If you wait to get transportation until you arrive, bring the address with you. Our driver didn't know where the hotel was and had to stop for directions twice. (We used Greenline for the trip from airport to Playa) The beach was clean, the staff was friendly and attentive. (this was probably amplified because we tipped before we knew gratuity was included, ah well) Right before we left home I read two or three bad reviews and got a little concerned, but after our stay I don't understand why someone would call it a 'dump'. Sure it's older and basic but in my opinion was quaint and interesting and so much better than being herded into mealtime with 800 other guests. That's our opinion anyway.

We had reservations at the Fusion Hotel where we had stayed 4 or 5 times previously when it was under different ownership (and was called Hotel Alejari). The last time we stayed there was only two years ago. This time was a disaster. Not only did they have our reservation all wrong......(we should have been booked for 4 nights, but had been booked for the first night only), but the rude and arrogant young owners really didn't care at all that we were repeat guests or that the mistake was theirs. They gave us no consideration at all in their handling of the matter. We'd found out about the problem just days before our trip and had airplane reservations booked, etc. As this was the week of \"Presidents Day\" every hotel that fronted on the beach was booked, but fortunately we were able to find a lovely hotel a little further down and less than a half block from the actual beach for the remaining 3 days, so it worked out fine. The Fusion has lost its warmth and charm. We did not feel welcome there even for the one day we stayed and it seems that the new owners are turning it into a loud beach-bar type hotel with a staff that does not have the friendly, welcoming attitude they had before.

It was absolutely one of the best vacations my wife and I have ever taken. It really highlighted by our wonderful stay at the Fusion. There is not much more we can say that has not been already said about this wonderful gem of a hotel. Starting off with Kim and Alon who helped with great information and made our reservations effort very smooth. The staff from the waiters to Martina, our maid, were simply great. In real estate terms it is always location, location, location and the Fusion has about the best spot being smack dab in the middle of Playa as far as the walking street is concerned, 5th avenue. Most everything, including the Cozumel ferry, is a simple walk away. If you love to walk like we do, there are plenty of places to walk to. My wife and I and another couple had the two ocean front rooms with balcony and there is simply not a more beautiful view, in my opinion, anywhere on the beach. We walked the beach about a mile each way and did not find anything nicer. The rooms are somewhat spartan but clean and functional. We had the basics and that is all we needed. It took a little getting used to not throwing the toilet paper in the toilet (you have to use a little garbage can due to the old sewer system in Playa) but that was a minor nit. As other folks have noted the Fusion is scheduled for a renovation in the May time frame and hopefully things like the water pressure and some of the electrical will be upgraded. The beach, beach bar, and restaruant are great. The best drinks, in our opinion, are the Margaritas, Mojitos, and Cosmopolitans. Daquiris, Colodas are what they are, fruity drinks with not enough alcohol but you can fix that by adjouring to your room and spicing it up. At $4 a drink the price is very reasonable. Sitting on the beach at night, listening to a little new age or jazz music is just heaven...with the surf crashing in the background. This is not and hopefully will never be Cancun, it is just too nice here and in Playa the way it is. We left our sliding glass door open every night except one and fell asleep to the pounding surf...just wonderful!! We sampled quite a bit of the local restaurants as well and found almost all of them wonderful. I'll add somethings under the Trip Advisor areas for restaruants and things to do so be sure to check those areas out as well. We cannot wait to book again next year...same time and definitely the same channel..channel #1 in our book...the Fusion Hotel.

Only really an issue at night and we really weren't hanging around the room too much, so take that for what it's worth (not much). When weighing that minor gripe against the hotel's service, location and other charms the place definitely comes up as a winner. The beach bar and restaurant were the perfect place to start the day with breakfast (we always added to the continental that was included). A few days we elected to simply park it on the beach in front of the hotel and seervice on the beach was very good , too. Lunches were tasty and the cerveza was cold. I enjoyed the music they played, a world beat vibe versus the techno thump thump heard at many other beach clubs. One afternoon they had a live 4 person drum band and that was great.

They arranged our shuttle from the airport for us, which was there as promised and excellent service. On arriving there, a booking error (not their fault) had occured and someone was still in the room we were supposed to be in. Being such a small hotel and booked full, we were worried about what we'd do for accomodations that night--but they had it under control! We stayed in the \"emergency room\" the first night, which was small and simple but clean and a welcome place to sleep after a day of traveling. We were very impressed that the hotel had a back-up plan for situations such as this, and also at their desire to make up for the inconvenience, which they did by offering us a free meal at the restaurant. This led to nearly all our meals during the stay being eaten at the Fusion restaurant, because it is absolutely stellar! The food was amazing, everything fresh and flavorful, portions ample, and prices very reasonable. The drinks were great too, especially the mango margaritas. The servers were wonderful--our favorite was Juanita--she's awesome! They all took great care of us both at meals and at the bar or sitting on the beach, with big smiles and great recommendations, and impromptu Spanish lessons that made us all laugh. We also very much enjoyed the company of Libby, the resident dog who was beautiful and sweet and made us feel right at home when we were missing our own dogs! One word of caution though--watch out for the habanero salsa--OUCH! Our room was simple and clean, little balcony overlooking the street and with a partial view of the ocean (#20). Like others have said, it was sparse, but we didn't go on vacation to hang out in a hotel room. It had a comfortable bed and clean towels and hot water and a fridge for water and beer--what more could you ask for?

Haying said that, this is the first time I have been to Mexico, so I thought a lot of things were wonderful. More seasoned travelers may have a better take, or at least be a little more blase', than I. I thought it was an excellent value. We had a garden room (#7). The garden is small and absolutely beautiful, redolent of bougainvilleas, roses, butterfly plants, ginger, and other tropical vines & plants. When we opened our windows, the huge blooming flowers pressed against the screens. It was great. Because the garden rooms are in several small buildings around the courtyard garden, we had windows on two sides, which was great for catching the breeze. There was a hammock chair on the little poarch that we shared with the next room. It was my 10 year old son's favorite place to read. The room itself was big and very clean, but very spare, with white walls, white tile and just one small chair. It was all we needed. It had a tv, and we watched South Park in Spanish and learned some new words. We brought a clothes line with us from home, and the room had hooks for it. The air conditioning worked well. We never ran out of hot water when showering. We never heard our neighbors through the walls. The beds were comfortable. They consist of thick matteresses on top of a concrete slab that is built into the floor, which was kind of cool. You can't move them around, and i would't advice jumping on them The beach was great. We walked all the way from playacar to the last resort on the beach, and I liked our beach the best. The beaches by the big pier were better, but they were really crowded. The beach at Fusion wasn't, but I think that is because there is a private house next door. If that property turns over and they build a big resort there, the entire vibe could change. Also, the beach right in front of Fusion is great for looking at the waves and the sunrise, but half of it has coral which makes it bad for playing in the waves, So, once again, if the beach next door goes private...(Kim at the front desk said that Fusion was talking to the owner of that propery about acquiring it, which would great.) Oh yeah - The hotel had a couple free bogie boards, which my son loved. The onsite restaurant was very good and a good value. The drinks were good, and I got to try some Mexican beers. (Modela Negra(?) is really good) Even though Fusion is right in the middle of everything, the hotel itself was very quiet, which was great for us. At night there were candles on the little tables on the beach and people were quitely talking and drinking. The music mix was good, and changed during the day. Some places that I walked by were blasting dance music at 10am in the morning. That would have drove me nuts. The entire staff was excellent. Kim at the front desk was friendly and very helpful. I tried to learn Spanish before i came, but repeating phrases to a CD is completely different than talking to a real person, and I failed completely. But it was not a problem, everyone understood English. It is a 10 minute walk down the beach to the ferry to Cozumal, and there is a Yoga studio 5 minutes down the beach the other way. There is a market 3 minutes away, right on 6th & Quinta, that sells water, bug stuff, snacks & beer. (It also had the best prices on Mexican blankets, but the chips were 4 bucks a bag.) Quinta, which in the main tourist strip, is right up 6th. Having said all this, I don't know if this hotel is for everyone. It is not plush, or trendy. It is anti-fancy, i guess. I liked the clean, cool tile floors and white walls, but other people might like something more colorful, or with more furniture. Here are somethings that didn't bother me, but that might bother other people: You can't drink the water. I don't know if you can anywhere in Playa Del Carmen. There is a market 1block away that sells water by the gallon, so the first thing we did was buy a bunch and put it in the room fridge. You can't flush toliet paper down the toliet. That was true of everywhere we went in both Playa and Akumal (including a Burger King my son drug me to.) I knew about the toliet paper thing, so for our rooms, we brough gallon zip locks and put the used in there. It was not a problem. The light in the bathroom worked for about 5 minutes at a time, and then would go off. There was a window in the bathroom, so there was light during the day. There was a crack in the tile in the bathroom wall. The room is very spare, with just one batik on the wall. I don't know if the TV gets any English channels (We didn't try.) The hooks for the clothes line go over one of the beds, instead of being in the bathroom, which would have made more sense. I'm not sure what is going to happen to the house to it; before we make reservations to go back, I will email to see if there is construction going on next door; If Kim is still working there, I feel very comfortable that she would tell me the truth.", "Date": "January 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cClean Spartan Room In Great Location\u201d", "Author": "jcfpny", "ReviewID": "UR6448225", "Content": "Spent three nights in a 2nd floor $70 Garden View room (#9) earlier this week. The Fusion is a very nice small property directly on what remains of the beach in Playa Del Carmen. The room was squeaky clean, if somewhat bare.

The AC could make ice cubes, but either the controls didn't work or I couldn't figure them out. \"On\" switch was circuit breaker on wall -- tried it once, didn't need it anyway. Wall mounted cable TV worked well. No phone. No clock. Wake-up calls (door knocks) by the night watchman successful once out of two requests. Good in-room safe. Only in-room seating was a small upholstered stool. The balcony had a table, chair and hammock type swing chair. Adequate plumbing needs upgrade. No lighting by sink or shelf-vanity. Adequate small refrigerator. All that being said, the room grows on you. Although I was traveling alone, my somewhat harder-to-please wife (ouch!) would have (after some initial hesitation) enjoyed this room. The trade off is the room for the beachfront property, s one quiet block off the main drag. You can walk virtually anywhere you need to go. The staff, especially Kim at the front desk, were all great and couldn't have been more helpful. The included breakfast was coffee, juice and various breads - worked for me. Eggs and other stuff on the menu. Restaurant/bar layout, food and service was great.. If you're traveling here from the Cancun airport take the hourly (on the hour) $8 ADO bus, which will leave you two blocks from the hotel. I thought this would be an old school bus, but it's acually a luxury Mercedes tour bus that takes an hour from CUN to PDC. If you're a \"carry-on\" traveler it's a deal, if you're a lots of baggage type, it still works. I can't say much about excursions. I mostly went scuba diving with the Kim reccomended Phantom Divers and they were great too. I can't say anything about shopping - I'm a coffee mug and t-shirt kind of guy. Unless, you need the security of being able to dispute a credit card charge, bring US cash. All merchants prefer it and you get a marginal break in prices. A final note about leaving from CUN.
