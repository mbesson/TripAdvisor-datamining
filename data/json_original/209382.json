When we arrived at the hotel we were met with friendly staff, i asked if we could have a room with a view, no problem but the only one they had was on the 32nd floor which was a smoking one but was told that we could try it and if we were not happy they would make sure that we get the next available room with a view. The room turned out to be fantastic, the view was amazing of Newyork....Empire State Building,Chrysler Building, Hudson River and in the distance The Freedom Tower. The room was lovely and clean, bathroom could of done with a lick of paint but the bed was so big & comfortable there was also a flat screen tv, not that we really needed it but it's nice to have some home comforts for the short time that your in the room. Found the staff to be very helpful & friendly, only thing that really bothered me was the day we were leaving the BellBoy was very kind & helped us outside with our cases to get a Taxi (which are all lined up outside all day & night)my husband tipped him 10 dollars but then the Doorman grabbed the cases before the Taxi Driver had chance & lifted our cases into the taxi, he then had the nerve to ask for a tip, my husband explained that he had already tipped the other gentleman and that he only had enough change for the taxi, so the Doorman then offered to change a 50 dollar bill for him....what a cheek!!!!,So beware,to have your cases moved 3 feet will cost you, we could of walked straight out of the hotel ourselves & get in a taxi and saved 12 dollars,even the taxi driver commented on that particlular Doorman how forward & cheeky he is.If we want to tip we will, but won't be told to do so.

We arrived at the hotel closed to 12.45 pm and our room was not ready. In fact, we only got our room at about 4pm, which was an exhausting wait after being on the road for 24 hours. At first, we were assigned to a room on the highest level (38th floor) that had a pretty view. However, the next morning, the whole room started vibrating and there was loud engine sound! We called to check on the situation and 2 engineers came up to inform me that it was due to a big generator right on top of the room, which would not usually happened on a normal working day (it was a Labour Day). They reassured me that the noise would go off soon. We didin't wait and called the Front desk to change rooms. The next room we checked into was on the 36th floor that was much much better in terms of view and privacy. It was a large corner room, with an unblocked, beautiful view of the river!!! We were very comfortable staying in that room til to the end of the trip. Apart from a good size and view, the room was clean, basic and tired. No mini bar or fridge or coffee pot or complimentary tea or coffee or toothbush. We insisted on having a fridge since we were staying for a month. Barry was very kind to arrange one in our room. You would probably need to call housekeeping to ask for bathrobes, drinking glasses, bedroom slippers, coffee pot and etc, which they would happily sent up upon request. The service provided by the hotel staff was friendly and helpful most of time. They would looked out for delivery parcels and would bring them up to the room especially they knew I was waiting anxiously for them. Thanks to Frank and Ansley. And also to Amy of housekeeping who had offered me some awesome tips. One important note is to avoid staying with the hotel during their peak period, sometime in 3rd to the 4th week of Sept where the UN general assembly would be running in full steam. With all the important delegates attending the meetings, the entire block was busy and security was very tight. There were also road closures, which made getting back to the hotel after a long day, extremely inconvenient! So do check the dates unless you want to be in the thick of things! Also, the hotel's breakfast was not too great. I think you will find better selections if you take a slow walk out of the hotel or to the Grand Central station basement.

However shame this was not carried thorugh to the rooms... When we gout out of the list on the 37th floor it was evident things were going to change as the carpets and walls were drab and dull and not at all like the foyer. We etered the room and were shocked at teh size it was a lot smaller then we had thought it would be for 3 people sharing, the beds too were a bit on the small size. comfortable though if a bit soft. there is no mini bar, no coffee or tea, no fridge, and very little room to hang any clothes, my daughter had to live out of her suitcase and i barly unpacked either, there just was not enough room. There is a \"walk\" in wardrobe, i use the word walk loosley as you can walk in alright but no more you can step in and one step only. The Bathroom, i barely want to discuss this.... the wallpaper is stained with reminants of puke and other goo, the skirting boards have been left unkept for so long they aare byond cleaning and are filthy, the side of the bath is full of skuff marks, and even after the cleaners had been they left behind hairs that had fallen in the sink, on the floor and failed to pick up simple things like receipts off hte floor, really poor, i dont think they know how to clean. the sheets were not changed to an acceptable time frame either, it was hard to tell but im guessing they were changed twice in our 10 day stay, and that is being generous. No one eats in this hotel, not sure why, but the breakfast bar is always empty and another guest told my husband not to eat here. although one night we got room service, it was fast polite and we enjoyed hte food. Although it was over priced for what you get.

The suite (bedroom upstairs, living area downstairs) was MASSIVE, but some of the furniture is chipped, cracked and showing it's age. The two bathrooms were spacious with everything you'd want, although even at 5ft 8, the bath was still tiny for me - God help anyone who's 6ft tall trying to bathe. All that said, the place had a certain charm and I was more than happy with the room - cracks in the furniture and tiny baths aside. The space was gigantic for Manhattan, the bedroom area was a little more modern and the bed itself was extremely comfortable. The views were phenomenal and with floor to roof windows, and rooms starting on the 29th floor, you are guaranteed a great view. My interaction with the staff was minimal other than checking in/out, however the people I did encounter were helpful, polite and welcoming. The location is excellent for anyone wanting to be in the city without the hustle and madness of other, busier areas. Grand Central is a 10 minute walk away, and Times Square will take you 15/20 minutes to walk to - but it's New York, walking anywhere and admiring the views is part of it's appeal. So, while I'd question how anywhere with 20+ year old furniture could have 4 star status, I wouldn't hesitate to book here again if the price was right.

Don't expect fancy little shampoos and bathrobes; it's not that fancy a place. I don't watch much TV but noticed less than clear reception when I turned it on to check the weather.

I mainly wanted to stay here for the location (outside of the hustle and bustle of the crowds, but well within the city with an easy commute). I was a little worried that I would have to wait for a room, as I had an extremely early flight. I was able to check-in early, and felt very welcomed. The only person that needed a personality check at the hotel was the clerk that checked me in. After that, everything was smooth sailing. I was not expecting the views. My bellhop was wonderful, and took time to point out the landmarks and make sure I was comfortable with the room. He also was quick to recommend different restaurants that surrounded the hotel, and little bars that would allow me to enjoy the weekend football games. That changed my whole view on the staff. Yes, his job is to make sure guests are comfortable, but he went above and beyond what was expected of him. He was proud of show his knowledge of the area, and make sure I was comfortable knowing it was the first time in the city alone. I have stayed in many places, and I can honestly say, if places would realize the perfect personality Frank showed me and welcomed me with, this place would have many more people returning. The rooms could use a lot of work. The decor is very dated, and there is mold and mildew in places that could use a lot of TLC. The drapes on the window were worn and the bed was probably being held together by a rope by the way it was unsturdy, but the carpeting was clean and there wasn't any dust. The room offers plenty of space for plugging in electronics, but the wall outlets were very loose. I felt I was going to break the walls unplugging things. There is plenty of space, though. More space than most hotels will offer. I know the review of the room makes the place sound practically awful, but it really isn't horrible. If they would just invest the time and the money into a good scrubbing and some new beds and decor, it would be top of its class. I never ate at the restaurant, or ordered any room service, or even explored the hotel bar. The prices were horrible, and the room service trays left by other guests on my floor didn't make anything look good. If you turn right out of the hotel and go to the first little deli/shop that you see on the right hand side, you will get a good sandwich for a very decent price (and they are open 24 hours a day). It is New York, and you will not be lacking in places to eat. Leaving the hotel was a very quick and nice experience. I had two very nice gentlemen assisting with my bags, and were refusing to accept a tip from me (I didn't know if I should feel offended, or pleased, but they were very kind). Would I return? Maybe.

The hotel is dark and dreary and the hallways were dingy and smelly. The room itself was quite unique being that it had a spiral staircase and occupied two floors.

No shopping, some restaurants and bars not worth mentioning. - The pool during August wasn't crowded but it seems really old.

We love to walk but since the surrounding area is kind of dull, we ended up using cabs and buses instead of going to Central Station everytime. - SOHO, NOHO, East Village, Tribeca etc. are far more interesting neighbourhoods than Midtown (especially eastern). - The hotel is in serious need of a renovation.

I was super excited for this hotel due to the outstanding views, gym, indoor pool, and the option to play tennis. We (my roommate and I) arrived at the hotel super late on Friday night - the bell man outside was super friendly asked us our names and our reason for visit. He was so kind asked us about your bus ride and why we were checking in so late. He then walked us to the front desk where the man behind the desk continued his conversation with someone in the back area. He saw us waiting and it took him a few minutes to make his way forward - It was fine we were patient it was only 2:30am! He then he gave us our room # and we proceeded on our ways. The room was beautiful. We were so lucky to have a corner room with panoramic views of the river, bridges, and the city. It was so pretty when you turned off all the lights. The room itself was very spacious and I was surprised there was a large comfortable couch in it. As we were packing to check out on Sunday I noticed 3 bugs crawling on the couch - I trapped one with the pillow to take a picture of it and then it ran off in between the couch. I was actually really disgusted with it knowing that I sat on the couch and wondered how many were actually in there. I reported it to the hotel that morning of check out but how the process was done it irritated me because it felt like I was on trial - for finding bugs IN THE HOTEL. They asked me all these questions which I guess is standard but I had a bus to catch - If i planned on finding bugs I would have checked out sooner.

There was an alternative room available which turned out to be small, miserable and drab without any views which we declined due to having already paid a premium price for a room with a view and no offer of a reduction forthcoming. Whilst the lobby is smart, the rest of the hotel is horribly dated and smells vaguely of cigarettes. Our sink had three large black cracks in it which apart from being nasty to look at is terribly unhygenic. The toilet flooded the bathroom the first time it was used and we had to use a bin to catch the water flow until the maintenence men could repair it. Also, one of the drawers broke on first use and again the maintenence men were sent to repair it. However, it took more than 48 hours and three formal requests including a personal trip down to reception for my bedside lamp to get a working lightbulb which was extremely annoying. We had no apology from the hotel for any of the inconvenience. The hotel is advertised as having tea and coffee making machines but there are none in the rooms; on further investigation, you can request a tea/coffee maker but then you have to keep ringing room service for sachets of tea and coffee as they are not topped up by the cleaning staff on a daily basis, so it's all rather hard work for the customer and you are really made to feel that you are being a nuisance to the staff. Breakfast was an outright rip-off by an over-rated restaurant stating international acclaim. One glass of fruit juice, one coffee, some badly cooked and tasteless scrambled eggs and two tiny over-cooked sausages for $39. Absolutely outrageous! My daughter was keen to try out the swimming pool and this was one of the main reasons we had booked this hotel. On the two occasions we used the pool, there were no fresh towels available for us to use although there were plenty of wet, used towels in heaps on the floor. The filth and dirt caked in around the showers demonstrated years of neglect with mould and growing bacteria. Unsurprisingly, we chose to use the shower in our hotel room instead. The interior edge of the swimming pool was covered in a layer of scum. Whilst the over-bearing male attendant was happy to bark out the rules and regulations of the swimming pool, he was less inclined to keep it hygenically clean. His colleague was constantly on the phone at the reception desk 'sweet-talking' to some unseen girl; he shrugged his shoulders when we told him there were no towels and barely looked at us as we requested locker keys. In conclusion, neither myself nor my daughter plan to stay in any Millennium Hotel anytime soon and we recommend you avoid them, too!

(see pictures) What a letdown then, to see a huge black stain (appeared to be motor oil) on the floor by one bed. It was only obvious when we pulled the covers to sleep, as it was near the headboad and obscured by the comforter. Also, the wallpaper was peeling from the bathroom wall at the bottom near the tub and there were water stains on the bathroom wall under the towel rack (across from the toilet) that appeared to indicate that the bathroom had flooded in the past with several inches water accumulation. Okay -- so far, aesthetics. However, there was also a huge crack/fissure in the frosted plated glass surrounding the sink. In two places. This didn't seem to pose a safety issue, as the crack was not to be felt from the surface. Still, I called the front desk to insist that someone come to look at it, as I did not want there to be a suggestion that my young children had contributed to the damage upon checkout. The bathroom didn't look all that clean (maybe the natural coloring of the floor, which was natural stone) so we went out of the hotel around 11 p.m. to find a store to pick up some cleaning supplies (remember - to us -- it was only 8 p.m. because our bodies were on Pacific Time). 1st Avenue at 44th was very bustling, even at that hour on a weeknight, so we felt very safe. There was a chain drugstore no more than a block away - so I purchased Clorox spray cleaner and wipes. There were several Deli/fruit/flower stands open (only in NYC right?) where we had a variety of made to order sandwiches, bottled drinks and I got the kids cereal and milk to take back to the room for a light snack. After that outing, I was reminded of how awesome it was to be in NYC and was feeling better. However, upon first \"use\" of the toilet by my 6-year old son around midnight, the toilet clogged!! Okay - so housekeeping had a plumber in the room in minutes and the towels (that I used on the floor) were promptly replenished also. The plumber himself commented that the toilet flush pressure was a little slower than optimum. Too bad the hotel was sold out, or I am sure that I would have been given the opportunity to move rooms. Anyway -- I don't consider myself that picky -- so I figured we would just have to deal with it for only one more night. At day break, I took in the expansive views and decided...let's keep this sad little room. (The view cured a lot of ills) I had early meetings, so for breakfast, I ordered for the kids only. I called at 6:15, was told that it would be 45 minutes. They have a very generous kids menu with choices at only $8! I ordered scrambled eggs, sausage, juice and toast for them to share. One order of pancakes and one order of french toast. Surprise, the breakfast arrived only 30 minutes later, steaming hot and tasted really good (kid review)!!. The next evening, after a long outing to ground zero and statue of liberty, we got back to hotel around 10 again. The kids were tired,so we ate in the hotel lounge adjacent to the lobby. One older, very pleasant waitress running about trying her best to handle probably 25 or 30 people! There was also one bartender. I couldn't believe it, considering the hotel was sold out! Again, once the two burgers, kids pizza and side salad got to us, the food was very good. The hamburgers were incredibly tender although well-done. They must use choice ground beef. However, I couldn't believe the $67 tab! I had a light beer for $7. The kids had one soft drink each. It turns out that their 8 ounce glass of pepsi was $5.00 a piece. It NYC I guess. But, I was appalled when the waitress returned with the check and had already added her 15% tip to it!! I scratched it, gave her $11 cash but told her that although the service was poor -- I didn't want to penalize her for being without adequate help. Bottom line, if you are a Yin-Yang person, and can accept that there are trade offs -- I think this hotel will do. It is advertised as ultra luxurious -- which was far from the case. But, the location is absolutely superb and the staff are so pleasant. My experience with room service was a 10. The restaurant was a 5 or 6. The view from my room (which had to be one of the most flawed on the property -- but I guess checking in late means you get what others passed on) covered a multitude of sins. However, I did not check out thinking that I will stay here again. Next trip -- I will try the Millenium Hilton -- at least I will get my HHonors points!", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Knoxville, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place, Great Price, Great Location, Excellent Staff\u201d", "Author": "Mack00013", "ReviewID": "UR112935650", "Content": "My wife and I stayed overnight in NYC after catching a mattinee of Mary Poppins on Broadway, and this place was a great find.

I could literally see the Empire State and Chrysler Building from lying in my bed, so when I returned this year with my extended family (including my 4 and 7 year old kids) we never even considered another hotel. We arrived at approximately 7pm (which for us was midnight), and the kids were beyond shattered after the 8 hour flight. We were helped from our transfer car by very attentive staff who handled a tremendous amount of luggage for us, as 5 of us were travelling round the US for 3 weeks - so you can imagine how much we had! I approached the front desk where Avery told me that as requested, they had blocked off 2 rooms for us on the same floor. However, looking at the children falling asleep, he said to me 'or i could offer you our 2-bed suite instead?\". I readily agreed, and after yet more excellent service, we opened the door to our suite and could not believe our eyes! The suite was quite literally bigger than our house! We had a hallway, 2 massive bedrooms (one twin queen, one king), enough storage for a family of 20!, 2 bathrooms, and then *downstairs* there was a further hallway, bathroom, kitchen and huge living / dining area! My son stills refers to it as our 'hotel house'! This suite was in the opposite tower to where I had originally stayed (i think it's referred to as the 'west' tower) and did not have the views of the Empire State and Chrysler which was a little disappointing, but we still had stunning views of the East River and the city, and the kids were so taken with the size of the suite - that was far more important. The king room had floor to ceiling / wall to wall windows, and we never closed the curtains once while we were there - why would you?! Having the swimming pool on the 27th floor was wonderful, and there is a small shop in the foyer should you need it. The location of this hotel is fantastic. Ten minute walk to Grand Central etc and you feel very safe here even after dark. It is also very quiet in the rooms - we never heard a peep from another guest in the corridors or adjoining rooms, and there is also very little outside noise too. Upon leaving, we were once again treated to the excellent attentions of staff who worked hard to arrange a vehicle large enough to take us to the airport, and once again moved all of our luggage without us even having to lift a bag. We found this hotel to be exceptionally clean and welcoming. I am not going to lie and say that all of the furniture and fittings are new because they're not, but they don't give you that horrible 'dirty feeling' you get in some hotels, and the beds are simply to die for - I have never slept in a bed more comfortable than the ones here! My only gripe - and there is only one, is that many of the electric sockets in the suite ranged from 'loose' to 'hangin off the walls', and with 2 little kids we did have to be vigilant that they ventured nowhere near them. However, if you don't want a view of an AC unit or a brick wall in the big apple, then this is the place to stay.... backed-up with lovely, lovely staff :0)", "Date": "June 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cWow- Horrible Service\u201d", "Author": "staticlinejumper", "ReviewID": "UR111903859", "Content": "I just stayed here for business, arriving late evening to a long, multinational line to check-in and a single clerk at the desk.

The corridor we arrived in stank of stale cigarette smoke and was dull and grimy. This theme continued in our room. The man on the front desk had not mentioned we had been given a smoking room; he did not ask for our preference and we did not think to request a non-smoking room. However this was not the only disappointing factor about the room. The furniture was old and worn, as was the bed linen. The curtains were covered in stains and the chairs in the room were disgusting; smelly and soiled with who-knows-what. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dckitchen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 area was horrible and dated, the air conditioning was antique and the bathroom was grim and needed a good dose of bleach.

We arrived a little early from JFK however the front desk were extremely friendly, informative and most accommodating and allowed us to check in at that time, so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to wait around. Rooms within other hotels in NYC are usually on the small side so I am told however our room here was most spacious, king size bed (at least), flat screen TV and room safe etc & extremely clean. Reasonably sized bathroom, with bath/shower, sink, toilet & hairdryer etc \u00e2\u20ac\u201c what more would anyone want. Our room was simply superb, views were stunning night and day, and we could not fault it at all. We had a view over the east river looking south towards lower Manhattan/Wall St etc and it was stunning any time of day, also great views of both the Empire State Building and the beautiful Chrysler building, stunning. It was a pleasure to wake up in the morning, and always a pleasure to return. 27th Floor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the pool and the fitness centre are wonderful. And there is also a sauna although we did not use it. FYI you need to use the 2 right hand side lifts in order to access the 27th floor. Well worth the effort and a great way to relax after a hectic day around the sights. The Millennium Plaza is a wonderful hotel, we did not want to leave and we will certainly return next time we visit NYC, thank you to all the staff for making it a great stay. If you have not visited before this may help too: To and from JFK \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we used an official yellow cab. There is a flat rate fare of $45 + $5.30 tolls + tip (15-20% expected \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we paid $60 and the drivers seemed very happy with that). At the taxi rank tell the attendant you want the flat rate fare to your destination before you depart (if that is what you want) else you will get the standard metered fare. You will then be given an official piece of paper with the driver\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number on etc, which I thought was most re-assuring. The journey took about 25 minutes but I think we were very lucky, expect anywhere up to an hour in traffic, which is what it took when we returned to JFK. Again on the return leg don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget to ask for the flat rate fare. We also got charged the $5.30 toll upon the return to JFK, not sure why as I think it is a one way toll but I could be wrong, still it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worth the debate during or at the end of the journey. There are some cheaper alternatives into Manhattan but for the few extra $s I have to say door to door this is far the easiest and best use of your precious time. There is so much to see but here are a few we did and would recommend: Rockerfeller Centre for great panoramic views, you can get a 2 visit ticket to see night and day. Well worth it. Staten Island Ferry \u00e2\u20ac\u201c its free, and stunning views of Skyline, and of Statue of Liberty. Central Park \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with a good pair of walking shoes. Grand Central Station \u00e2\u20ac\u201c what a wonderful building & only a 5/10 mins walk, couple of blocks straight down 44th. The underground - is a must just to say you have done it, very safe in the day We used it a couple of times to return from Lower Manhattan which is worth a walk through the different areas but takes time ($2.50 per single ride, pay at machine). We found Grand Central station to be the closest to the Millennium Plaza hotel, plus there was something special about disembarking at the iconic station that appears in so many movies. Also there is a great Deli at the corner of 44th and 2nd, turn right out of hotel lobby and 2 minutes if that, on the corner. It has every thing you want and very reasonable, coffee, donuts, fresh sandwiches, you name it has it. Great place. Trip Advisor has been a great resource to me so I hope these few words are of use to someone else especially if you are new to NYC as I was, and the few places mentioned are just a sample of the many places to see and visit.

The doorman (Robert) was wonderful, as were the front desk staff. Making my way to my room on the 37th floor, I noticed that the lobby area is up to date and immaculate. Howver, the corridor on the 37th floor has stained carpet. The room is nice and has a great view of the ciry and the East River. The sofa in the room has a few stains (I don't even want to know what from) but otherwise the room looks great. The bathroom is dated but functions well. Some of the bathroom lights are dim or not working, but otherwise acceptable. The hotel is quiet during the night. Early in the evening one can hear the neighbors talking in the hallway, but no traffic or weather noises are heard. The onstie restaurant is the Ambassador Drill Restaurant. Though the booklet in the room tells me that the restaurant is open for dinner 7 days a week from 5:00 PM to 10:30 PM, this is not true. The restaurant is not open after noon, so one is supposed to eat in the lounge. I went to the lounge twice and was quite surprised that I was not seated or acknowleged - and there were only three other patrons in the place! Needless to say, I had to walk to nearby restaurants to eat my evening meals. Breakfast at the Ambassador Grill is good but EXPENSIVE. Plan on laying out $30 per person for the buffet - way too much for what one gets if you ask me. I did not use the gym equipment but did attempt to use the pool (located on the 27th floor). The gym and pool are open to hotel guests as well as outside \"club\" members. A bitter old woman (a club member) gave me such a hard time about using \"their\" pool that I just packed up and came back to my room. It is a shame that bitter, snotty people ruin what should be a relaxing experience for guests of these hotels ... especially considering the amount of money we pay to stay here. Needless to say, I'll not use the facilities the rest of my stay. I titled this posting \"Mixed Feelings\" because there is potential for this hotel to be a fantastic experience for NYC visitors.

The location is ideally situated for the UN, and about 5 mins walk from Grand Central. Its not a busy area though at night, so I felt slightly unsafe walking back from Times Square one night at about 9pm. The rooms are big. There's plenty of space. And the view is nice - I was on 34th floor, looking over the river. And the pool was lovely - theres a pool, sauna (on the small side and not overly hot, but fine) and some exercise machines. The view from the pool is also fantastic. But, there were lots of things that weren't what you'd expect for this price. And I was there for 7 nights, so it got a bit annoying. Firstly, the service was poor. I arrived and there wasnt an iron in my room or a sewing kit (I needed a needle). I rang and asked for them - was passed through different departments of the hotel and had to argue with them re the need for an iron, apparently there was one in my room (there was meant to be but there wasnt). Had to wait 20 mins for someone to bring me an iron, and when the iron arrived was told that I had to wait for someone else to bring me sewing kit (and by sewing kit, I just mean the needle and thread you get in pretty much every other hotel). So that was about an hour of waiting in room for basics. I also disliked the fact that the hotel only provided cheap soap - there was no shower gel, and the soap was poor quality - it was one of those thin white bars. You can request a coffee machine in the room, which I did. Machine arrived, with 2 packs of coffee. I was there for 7 days. When I ran out of coffee I rang and requested more, again I was told that it would take at least 30 mins to come to me - about 40 mins later they arrived, with one pack of coffee and one of decaf. I would have thought they could have serviced that with the rooms or given enough coffee for the stay. It felt cheap, and unnecessary given I was paying around $200 a night. Other service issues I had - on check out, there was a 30 min plus wait as only one person at the desk for midday check out. This was also annoying. On the plus side, when I left the doorman helpfully insisted on finding me a taxi and ended up taking me down to 1st avenue to hail one. He was very nice, and refused my tip. Back to the room - it was noisy. I dont know why. The air conditioning was far too loud to have on at night (and it was winter anyway) but there were weird noises in the room which kept me awake. I was in a corner room, close to the lifts - but I still dont know what they were. The first night I walked outside my room trying to identify source of noise but couldnt. Basically sounded like some kind of constant generator type sound. Very annoying. I probably should have complained but given I was working long days, and the unresponsive service on other issues (see above) I didnt think it was worth the hassle. Other people staying there also commented that the rooms were noisy. I'm 99% sure they didnt change the linen the whole time I was there. There is a note by the bed that if you want your sheets changed put this note on the bed and we will change, otherwise we will change them every three days. I dont think this happened. Towels were replaced though. The internet is expensive - $13 for 24 hours of wifi. If you log on using two separate devices (ie, iphone and a laptop) they charge you twice. I did ring about this halfway through stay, and actually got a helpful person who said that this happened, deleted the double up charges and told me just to choose the iphone or laptop for rest of stay. So, I guess it was good that some of the charges were deleted, but it was annoying only being able to choose one or the other. Again, i thought it was a bit petty and cheap. And there's a bar and restaurant. I didnt eat breakfast there (very expensive) and did have drinks at the bar - the waitress was so grumpy it was almost amusing. The rooms are not particularly modern, you can tell in the furnishings where they used to have fridges and safes in the room - but they don't anymore. I was surprised there wasnt a safe. So, if you're working long hours at the UN, this is conveniently located.

On a recent business trip, I decided that I would give this hotel a try since it was just a block or two from my office in New York. I thought that this would be a well maintained hotel since it was across from the UN in a not-too-bad neighborhood in Midtown. The minute I walked in the lobby, I knew I had made a mistake. Although the staff was friendly, the lobby was worn-out and dated. It looks like they may have updated the lobby in the mid to late 80s. When I arrived at my room, I thought I had gone back 40 years in time. The fixtures and the furniture did not look like they had been replaced since the hotel opened in the mid-70s. Actually, the fixtures and furnishing may be older than that because it looked like my room was designed and built as a studio apartment. The room was outfitted with a sink, fridge, stove combination common in NY studio apartments. My guess is that this hotel used to be an apartment building that got a facelift on the outside. The carpet in my room was dingy and stained, and it matched the dirty and broken curtains. The linens on the bed were clean. The closet doors were broken and would not slide from side to side. The TV looked new. The windows were so small and dirty that it was hard to see the view that was touted in the hotel brochures. The shower/tub had good water pressure and plenty of hot water, but the floor felt a little slimy.

Bedroom had king-size bed, built in wardrobe and separate bathroom. Both the living room and bedroom had windows across the wall, which had fantastic views, which are probably standard in every room, on the East building, as the rooms are all above the 28th floor, so beware if you are afraid of heights! We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the gym but we did go in the pool, once. I was quite disappointed as the pool was really cold, which I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind in the Caribbean but in New York, no. However, the views from the pool area were very nice, overlooking the UN building with the Chrysler building in view. The changing rooms to the gym/pool had saunas, but this meant there were separate saunas for males and females. The hotel also has tennis courts on the 38th floor. If you are hungry don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother with hotel meals, the first night we ordered room service (a small pizza, fries and a bottle of wine) costing $90. We also had the breakfast buffet in the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant, The Ambassador\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Grill, which was equally expensive. For two people at the breakfast buffet, cost $60. The buffet was nice, but wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a lot, especially in terms of cooked breakfast items. We did find two restaurants close by, which had really good food, for good prices. We used John\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (corner of 44th and 2nd) as our breakfast base, tea and coffee is free, staff constantly coming round to refill your mug, and the pancakes were to die for. $15 for two people to have pancakes with free hot drinks, you really can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t complain and Dean\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (2nd Avenue between 42nd and 43rd) which did really good Italian food, lunch specials costing just $11 each and evening meals about $15 per person.

The staff were all really nice -- I want to be clear about that. Really helpful actually. We kept losing our keys and they always made us new ones.... Here were some issues we had: 1) The housekeepers will clean your room, but they won't touch your dirty dishes. When we inquired, we were told that union rules dis-allowed housekeepers to do dishes. Never heard that one before..... Funny to come back and find the room sparkling clean but a pile of dirty dishes in the sink..... 2) The pool is beautiful, but it closes down at 6 PM every day except Friday and Saturday, which will render it useless for those who stay here and do stuff during the day. The lifeguard union in NYC is notoriously strong, so I assume they make it expensive to keep it open to normal hours. 3) We rented a big suite -- and paid upwards of $450 a night for it -- we had a full kitchen, but it was like pulling teeth to ask housekeeping to deliver any usable cookware. In the end we had to go buy a pot and knife ourselves, as they refused to provide us with a decent one. The kitchen worked well -- but be fore-warned that you should treat this like a camping trip and bring your own stuff.

I recommended it to friends and family throughout the '90's and most recently in 2007. This was my first stay there in several years, and the recent traveler reviews had me a bit apprehensive. Those concerns were unwarranted based on our experience this past weekend. We arrived at the UN Plaza, following a red-eye flight from the West Coast, at 6:30 am. I'd called the day before to request early check-in, and was told that while the hotel would try to accommodate us, it would depend upon room availability, which made sense. While I had reserved a room with two beds, there was none available at that unGodly hour, and we were offered a room with a king-sized bed, on the top floor, which we gratefully accepted. It was absolutely beautiful. The room was spacious, nicely updated and redecorated, with spectacular, panoramic open views looking east to the United Nations, and south, down the East River, the FDR Drive, and First Avenue. We could see the bridges to the south, and the Empire State Building to the southwest. It was breathtaking. Being on the top floor meant that we were immediately below the roof-top tennis courts, which occasionally meant we felt like there were small children thundering down the hotel corridors. Nonetheless, we absolutely enjoyed our room and our four day stay at the UN Plaza. The staff was cordial, professional and helpful. Housekeeping was attentive and invisible. The beds and linens were beyond comfortable. We had a platform bed and wonderfully supportive mattress, with light-weight feather comforter that was cozy and warm without being oppressive. The UN Plaza is located in midtown, on the eastern-most edge, an easy walk to the subway at Grand Central Station, and even better for our purposes, between the First and Second Avenue buses which run north and south, respectively, and close to the cross-town 42nd Street bus, as well. There are always taxis available at the hotel or close by. Second and Third Avenues in midtown offer a wealth of restaurants of every variety within easy walking distance. While frequent City visitors know this already, the less-seasoned beware: current NYC hotel taxes (obviously applicable to all, not just the UN Plaza) can add $50, 60, 70 or more to already costly accommodations, and are not included in the room rate quote. I think that the UN Plaza offers terrific value in the four-star hotel category, and that the staff members at the front desk, bell staff, doormen, concierge and housekeeping could not have been more appropriate.

Even though the complex looks modern, the lobby and the restaurant looks more like a disco from the 70\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s with its mirror walls.

I arrived at 1pm and they annoyed me immediately when they told me my room was not ready and that the check in time is at 3pm. I know for a fact that no hotel in NYC is at full capacity in this economy so it is not that there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a room, it was probably that it was not cleaned in time for the next guest as they have few cleaning people working. At 2:50pm I tried to check in again and they keep saying check in is at 3 pm. So I was finally able to check in at 3pm. I believe the room was ready and they just wanted to make me wait 10 more minutes to comply with their process. In NYC, there is no time to waste and their job to accommodate guests, as best as they can, do not seem to be their top priority. The room that I stayed in was supposed to be an upgraded superior room but it looks more like a standard room (I looked at pics of their rooms on their website and other travel sites). My room was on a high floor so the views are magnificent. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor looks modern but the fixtures are coming apart and the walls have a lot of scruff marks. The bathroom was generous size but the bathtub looks grimy even though it is clean, there is mildew around the tiles surrounding the bathtub, the shower curtain was slightly moldy and the toilet had a very slow flush. The bed was very comfortable but the pillows seem to be overused by 5 years -when you lay down on them your head sinks to the bottom. It seems the only new items replaced are the large flat screen TV and toilet paper. Everything else is old, overused and poorly maintained. I also had the $19 buffet breakfast at the hotel restaurant. The food was just average and not that much of a selection. I believe the high cost was not for the food but for the service and presentation. Tablecloth covered the tables, cloth napkins and stem glasses for water and juice were used. The waiters were dressed for a fine restaurant dinner service which was not necessary for a morning buffet style breakfast service that only requires bus boys to clean the tables. The restaurant only operates for breakfast. This hotel is really for every type of travelers. Families with small children, old and young couples, business people, Africans associated with the UN, western Europeans, euro trash and flight attendants filled the hotel. There is a fee for wifi but you could get a free public connection in the lobby. If you want the newspaper you have to go to the lobby to get it.

We stayed for 6 nights. I was wary before arriving at the hotel, because of the negative reviews that I had read on this site. I was pleasantly surprised in every way...by the staff, as they were all so pleasant and accommodating! They treated us like we were at a 4-5 star hotel. The pre-purchase price was the best deal in town, and had they had availability for a longer stay, we would have stayed there longer. The bed was rather soft, but it had a plush feel. Once I got used to it, I didn't want to get out of bed! The pillows were down, and we found them to be very comfortable. The down comforter made us feel right at home, since that's what we use on our bed. The Breakfast buffet was quite delicious. Yes, it was $18.95, which some reviewers have commented on as being pricey, but when you compare it to the prices in NY, it is quite reasonable. Everything is high in NY! The rooms do need some refurbishing, but they were all very clean, and huge! We had a room on the 40th floor, city view, and the view was magnificent! There was a bank of closets with sliding doors (with a safe), and a minibar area (which was no longer functional) with a cabinet on top (great for storing snacks, meds, etc. A sitting area near the windows that actually opens. We loved our room! I highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay out of the hub of the busyness of midtown. Traveling to other parts to sightsee is a bit time-consuming, but it's a nice and quiet area. If you don't mind walking a bit to the nearest subway, then this is a great location. However, if you don't have the energy or the time to walk to catch public transportation, then it's not the place for you. Cabs are easy to catch right in front of the hotel, as they are constantly dropping off guests to the hotel. I am very picky when it comes to hotels. But, I found the room to be quite nice...no problems with odors of any type, and one huge plus...it was not a window unit a/c. However, we found the temperature a bit difficult to control. But, I found it comfortable when we turned it off after running it a while. We slept with it turned off all night, and was quite comfy in very hot weather. We really hated to leave the next day!

We arrived for a romantic weekend away in the city and were told our \"New Updated\" Superior Room in the East tower was ready (we at this point did not know the vast difference between the East and West towers). We went to our room expecting to find the magnificent views pictured in most of the photos here at tripadvisor taken and posted by other guests who had stayed there. Instead we were looking at a wall out our window (the window was four feet off the ground with a stained couch in front of it, yes you cannot stand in front of the window and look out, the couch you see in many of the pictures is right in front of the window! Some of the rooms appear to have side drapes in the guest photos to block the morning light from flooding around the large gap between the shade edge and the wall in the pull down shades, none of the four rooms we saw did) and no tub in the bathroom. We went down to the front desk and he moved us to a room in worse shape, stained and ripped furniture and the bathroom had a two-inch gap from the rug to the floor where the threshold was missing. So back down to the front desk again. He moved us a third time (all still in the East Tower and yes we moved our bags all three times with no offer of help) it was late now and we had plans so at first glance the room looked fine, we dropped our stuff and headed out for our evening plans. We should of checked the bathroom, Mold and mildew everywhere, even on the floor. Down to the front desk again, a very nice young woman tells us she will have us moved to the west tower and to please just pack our bags and they would have them moved before we returned as we had tickets to a play for that afternoon. So we packed up again and headed off, returning that evening to find we had once again been moved to another room in the east tower. This room seemed ok with the least amount of stains so far, but still the one high window off the floor with the couch in front of it, until we went to take a shower the next morning. I got in the shower and it was broken! So back down to the front desk, the same young woman was working and I think she was genuinely surprised they had not moved us to the West tower. She let me see a room before we moved and the difference in the rooms is like night and day (the rooms you see with the floor to ceiling windows and the beds having nice furniture and simple thing like bed skirts and windows with real drapes to block out the morning sun or to nap in the afternoon are in the West Tower. I went and told my wife at breakfast that yes we were moving to a fifth room (we were on a bed and breakfast package, the breakfast buffet is ok, but what four star hotel has one toaster, where guests stand in line to toast their own bread and bagels). When asked about being compensated for what felt like a lost weekend (my wife felt our whole weekend had been truly thrown off, I felt we were always unsettled) the hotel did offer to take fifty dollars off our bill for our trouble.

The bed was very comfortable, the room and the bathroom were spacious. There was even a large flat screen TV. The only suggestion I would make is that the rooms could use a little TLC. The carpet, door handle, doors and chairs were a little worn. They could probably spend $100 and really do a nice job updating the room. But other than that, for a NYC hotel, I have no complaints. Food: If you are on a budget, there are several options in this area. On 44th between 1st and 2nd ave, there is a little deli/store with seating in the back. You can get an omellete, hashbrowns and toast for $3.99 or a bagel for $0.85. Some people have suggested John's on 2nd at 44th. It's good and John is really nice. For two people though, it'll cost about $20. One night we had supper at L'Ecole, the French Culinary Institute restaurant. The students prepare a 5 course meal for $42. This was an amazing experience. In NYC, restaurants are not cheap so to walk away from a 5-course meal for two including a bottle of wine for about $130 is a steal. You can also get a teacher-prepared 4 course meal for $42. The food was delicious and very well prepared. They do prepare food the way it is \"supposed\" to be prepared so if you have preferences, you should tell them. For example, one customer was upset that her lamb was still pink.

This was both good and bad. Good because there weren't too many tourist-types in the area, and bad because it was a small walk to get to the subway (Grand Central was about five blocks away). The hotel itself was nice, the room was well furnished and the view was excellent, looking over the East River. The only complaint is that our room was so high (we were on the 34th floor) that I was unable to get a decent cellular or Internet signal. However, if I went to the lobby both worked fine. The hotel did offer a wired Internet connection for - I believe - $10 per day, but I didn't use it, so I can't speak to the quality. Sitting in the lobby offered a number of selections to connect to for free so I had no reason to do so, but if you want to work from your room that is one option. On one occasion I was able to connect to a wireless connection from the room but the quality wasn't good and I wasn't able to make the connection at a later date, though I could see a number of networks. This being New York City, there are a number of dining choices all around, but most are of the deli variety and if you want to eat something nicer you may need to travel a bit. There is a dining room in the lobby called the Ambassador Grill that looked pretty nice, but we didn't try it, so I can't speak to the quality. If the prices are any indication, it's quite good, but we weren't prepared for a nicer dining experience, so we stuck to the other places, readily available just down the block (and they were much cheaper too). The only complaint we had is that one of the four elevators didn't work the whole time we were there (they were apparently upgrading it) and another of them was out of service for about half the time (same excuse). A near-40 story building needs a bit more than two elevators. When three were working it was okay. With four, I suspect it would be fine.

The suite had an AMAZING view of the skyline and river! There were two full bathrooms and a living room/ sitting area and separate bedroom. We didn't need all of that space as we didn't spend much time in the room. The rooms very clean and well maintained, and I really don't have any complaints. We were with another couple who staying in a regular room and they said it was very nice as well. The decor of the hotel is slightly dated, but not shabby or in disrepair. The staff was very friendly and accomodating. The location was pretty good, we were able to walk to many of the places we were going. Overall, I think this was a good value. We paid $175/night at Christmas time and I think it was a good price for this hotel.", "Date": "December 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambs", "Title": "\u201cHotel is good, but the pool was a let down\u201d", "Author": "Chris1978", "ReviewID": "UR23105302", "Content": "Stayed here for a few days in December whilst on a tourist visit. Overall this hotel is reasonably priced for NYC, yes it could be better but by no means is it bad - we had a very pleasant stay. Positives: - Fantastic Views across the Hudson River (we were in the West Tower 36 floors up) - All rooms will have good views as the rooms are based between the 28th and 38th floor - Rooms were spacious, beds were comfy and had a good choice of TV channels - Good selection of mini-bar (but very expensive!) - Could check-out in your room (via the tv set) or access your current bill - Location is okay, a bit away from all the hustle and bustle but still close enough to walk - There a good deli shop which is ideal for breakfast about 60 metres up from the hotel (turn right out of the hotel) Negatives: - Swimming pool was a disappointment. Based on the 28 floor the views were amazing but were let down by the temperature of the pool (very cold) and the general age and state of the pool/changing area. Really could do with a re-fit. Such a shame as it could be such a selling point. -The large full-length mirror next to the toilet - absolutely hilarious! What made someone decide to put one there is beyond me...why would you want to watch yourself wiping your backside?! Still makes me laugh thinking about it. - Public Internet access was expensive ($2 for 2 mins) - Why charge such silly amounts?? - Mini bar and snacks were expensive - People might actually use them if they were reasonably priced - The nearest subway station (Central Station) was a good 10 min walk away which wasn't ideal.

The only problem I could see was the hotel restaurant , it was extremely expensive. But I discovered a little deli practically next door. I bought a breakfast sandwich and coffee and ate it in my room. The hotel is also near Grand Central Station and a variety of shops so it's a good place to get in a little shopping. I learned that this hotel is the official hotel of the Rachel Ray show. I looked in the lobby for celebrities but didn't see any.

Ask for a room in the East Tower. Kick and scream until you get it. My room (3435) had a nice view of the Chrysler Building and the top third of the Empire State Building, but not much more. The room was drab with mostly flesh-tones, and an odd mix of a couple of new things and lots of old stuff. There was a large flat screened TV (nice), and a couple of new table chairs, but these were mixed with an old 1960's looking kitchenette - two burners and a small fridge, but no utensils... like an abandoned dinette set. The peephole in the door was clogged with paper (nonfunctional), the sink drain was stuck in a permanent down position and had to be completely removed so water could drain. The cabinets and doors were old, and there was an oddly small (and quite uncomfortable) armchair... perhaps for munchkins. The bathroom in general was in need of rehab, with a shower head at shoulder height and grout in need of cleaning or replacing. Room service for dinner was not good, except for the NY cheesecake. The \"NY Cheesesteak sandwich\" was gristly, and the asparagus soup was bizarre. My stomach is still upset. There was no coffee maker in the room and no luggage rack. The bed was the hardest one I can ever remember sleeping on - it was uncomfortably firm. This is not usually a problem for me.

It started badly with the taxi driver dumping us and our luggage on first street. My husband left me on the sidewalk with the luggage to get someone to help us with our stuff. He returned with a luggage cart. The guys inside had told him they could not come down to the corner of the street, but had given him the cart - something they weren't allowed to, but did anyways. So we pushed our luggage up the sidewalk to the hotel, where the guys took over. Great! We checked in with a guy who was not overjoyed to see us. He told us he had upgraded us to a superior corner room with the best view, non-smoking. My husband had forgotten to add non-smoking when he booked the hotel (there was no button there, you need to add this in your comment it seems) so he emailed twice asking them to mark our room non-smoking with no reply from them. It sounded nice to be upgraded, so we were cheery. We had also requested a room as high as possible which we did not get. We were still in the lower floors, though it was high enough in the end. Just not what we had specifically asked for. We then went to the elevator and got upstairs. The hallways wiped the cheery smiles off our faces quickly. There was red tape all over the floor, where the brownish carpet had been ripped. We were all the way down the hall and entered our room which was very hot. We turned the AC to its coldest and it did send out cool air, but the window shades had been up all day, so the sun had heated the room up to over 80 degrees - despite the AC. We lowered the shades right away, which helped a little. The view really was pretty good, though to see Empire State Building and Chrysler Building we had to almost lean out of the window - which was impossible, because the window does not open. We had chosen that hotel especially because we saw that you could open the window. It didn't matter much, but, the windows were really dirty, both from in- and outside. I went to the bathroom and was shocked by the state of the bathroom! The sink was sitting inside a glass surrounding, but that was totally cracked! I always feared it would fall apart while I was in there. The big mirror next to the toilet was dirty and chipped on the upper part. The floor tiles were chipped or cracked - at least 50% of them were not in one piece anymore. It didn't happen to us, but on those chipped tiles you can easily cut your foot open when you walk with bare feet. The walls were heavily stained, even some browning liquid had trickled down the wall in one place. Not a big thing, but still: ICKY! Don't wanna know what that was. My husband took a shower - only to bathe his feet almost up to his knees because the drain worked so poorly. The bathroom had no working fan/ vent. For the 2 of us there was only 1 washcloth in total. I called housekeeping and they told me it would take them 10 - 15 minutes at least to bring some up. 20 minutes later I had 3 extra wash clothes. (Not the newest, but they seemed clean.) There is a high headboard above the bed and there was a big thing of dust looking down at me when I was in bed. I was not very happy with the room, so I got out our reservation and found out we had not been upgraded at all! The room we were in was exactly what we had booked and paid for - only thing was non-smoking and that can hardly be an upgrade! In the morning, it got really hot again, even though the shades had been down straight away. I went to complain to the front desk. The lady there never even said she was sorry. I had written a long list of things we didn't find alright and by the time I had gotten to number 3 she wasn't even listening to me. She asked me to leave the list with her to give to the housekeeping manager. That apparently did happen, because the stains had been cleared off the bathroom walls and the windows had been cleaned from the inside. The plug in the tub had been replaced. Of course, the tiles, the mirror and the sink would have needed big time construction and that we would not have liked within our 2 night stay. The dust was also still looking at me. The tip we had left in the hope to get a cleaner room was left untouched. So, all in all there was some improvement, but it was not what we had expected, wanted or had to pay for. My husband checked out and told the next guy at the front desk about all our complaints again. The guy said he was sorry for our inconvenience and said all he could do with the room rate was not charge the internet we had used on one of our 2 days. So that was a big disappointment in the end. The only person who managed to get a tiny smile on our face was Ozzy, because he was really nice and treated us as we would have expected by any one of those people in the hotel.

Check in went okay and offered a room on the 36th floor following use of a Travelzoo promotion of $199 per night.

Reception then gave us an upgrade to a suite on the other side of the building on floor 29 but looking out of that window, noticed there was a huge building site outside, so we declined that room as understood the building works started very early. We were then returned back to the 36th floor into a room 2 doors away from the original one - standard style room but it had the great views of the two main buildings.

Asked the barman and waitress if this was normal and were told \"eat here in the bar if you can find a seat\". We had looked forward to a quiet dining experience and ended up having a sandwich in the bar with a very surly waitress. We were so shattered, we just accepted it as we didn't want to walk anymore with very tired feet.

It's four blocks to the nearest subway station (Grand Central) which has a market place and food court. Since it's close to the UN, there is plenty of security, some with dogs. Have pool on 27th floor, didn't get a chance to use. Surrounding areas: Near the Chrysler Building (Lexington & 42nd); United Nation (1st Ave); Fifth Avenue; Diamond District (47th & 5th); Grand Central; Rockerfeller Center; Empire State Building is further down on (5th and 34th). It's two blocks from the Rachel Ray show. Rooms: Larger than most hotel rooms in NYC. We had a nice view of the East River (East Tower is the refurbish tower). The hotel starts after the 27th floor, so I'm sure all the rooms have nice views of the city. The King bed was comfortable, there is a couch under the window. The bathroom was nice and functional, two average person can fit easily. The toilet ran all night. Safe inside a small walk-in closet. A large flat screen TV. No coffee maker, minibar and snack baskets were expensive. There is a convenience store down the street, get your drinks and snacks there. Coffee cart outside the hotel for a quick breakfast. Staff: Overall very courteous staff. We arrived in the morning, our King bed room was not ready, but they offered us a double, we wanted the King, so we asked them to hold our luggage and return after 3 p.m. We asked for a quiet room not near the stairs or elevator, but right outside our room was construction...crane and all. We didn't complained to the hotel because the construction crew started work at a respectable time (7 a.m.). We thought the hotel should have told us before hand, so beware if you're a light sleeper. Eats: Plenty of restaurants in the surrounding areas. John's Cafe on 44th; Cosi's; Riki Japanese Restaurant on 45th and various bars, pubs, coffee shops and a few nicer restaurant nearby. We didn't eat at the on-site restaurant Ambassador Grill. Price: We booked directly with the hotel, but found the deal first from Travel Zoo for $199 per night. We stayed for four nights, with taxes it was under $920. Transportation: Buses run on 1st and 2nd near the hotel. Get your unlimited daily or 7 day unlimited metrocard ($25) for buses and subway. but not the AirTrain. Plenty of taxis near hotel if you need one. The nearest subway is Grand Central Station. We took the Airtrain (JFK) to the hotel. Airtrain and subway to Grand Central was approm. a little over 1 hour. Take Airtrain to Jamaica Center, than take subway \"E\" to 51st & 6th; transfer to \"6\" to Grand Central (asked attendant for assistance to your destination, they were very helpful). Buy the Airtrain ticket from the ticket machine, it's cheaper than buying it from the guy who owned the store. there are MTA agents to assist. Cost using Airtrain/Subway to Manhanttan was about $7.00 per person. Cheaper than the $55 (including tax and toll) taxi ride for two people. If you're planning to take subway, ask for a free map at the airport information booth before you depart the airport. The map is really helpful. The hotel also will have brochures of area maps and destination. If you didn't bring your own. Overall the hotel was a great find, they held our bags until our evening departure. Nice sitting area, elevators were efficient and fast. A small gift shop is available near the lobby. The concierge was helpful.

I had a corner room (room 3940) and so had stunning views on 2 sides of the room through the floor-to-ceiling windows (see my pictures), directly overlooking the East River and part of the city. The bed was very comfortable too. My only complaint would be about the age of the facilities in the room. The TV, the light switches, the telephones, the air conditioning and the temperature control all look like things out of the 1980s (Im not kidding) - they have clearly not been replaced in many years and really let the room down. Aside from that, the room was great. The swimming pool in the hotel has great views through the windows, although it was freezing cold! Maybe the heater was not working the day that I went there. The hotel is a 20 minute walk from Times Square, which I found perfect as it was not too far to walk yet was far enough away from the business and noise that Times Square attracts.

This room was a bit nicer, and had a King Bed. But the odd thing about the hotel was how old everything seemed. The bed was really soft (too soft), the TV was ancient, and the fridge positively Jurassic. There was also a leak under the sink, which I mentioned to the check in staff on the way out - this was duly fixed, but for some reason, the message had also been confused into them thinking our safe was broken, so much to our surprise, next time we returned to the room, the safe had been locked with a different code to the one we set it with. A maintenance man came up and explained, but it was all a bit odd. After that our stay at the hotel was ok, but overall I was left with a disappointed feeling. The decor and customer service just was not up to scratch in the room. And the decor in the lobby was just unbelievable, all gaudy mirrors and black counters.

Some reviews have commented on the hotel being a bit out of the way, but it was only a few minutes walk from Grand Central, and we found the area a refreshing respite after the hustle and bustle. And there were lots of places to get food close by, including an indispensible 24hr deli at the end of the street! My only reservation about staying in midtown is that we found it a very tourist-oriented area, so looking for any sort of cool bar scene or nice independant restaurant usually meant having to go downtown.

Big mistake. There are two towers: one is old and in disrepair. It has not been renovated in decades. That is where our first room was located. Immediatley upon entering the room we were shocked at the condition: old, stained carpet with burn marks and the duvet cover was stained as well. The bathroom light fixtures had mutliple breaks in the glass and the bathtub was stained and chipped. When we called the manager was \"not available\" and the assistant manager claimed that they were fully booked and could not move us until the following day -- to the NEW tower. They don't publicize this dirty secret, but the support staff we spoke to explained the fact the that there are two towers, one recently renovated and the other a dump that has not been touched in decades, When we got to our new room, the tub was covered in some dark, foul filth -- it appeared that the pipes may have backed up. We called to have it cleaned and in 1/2 hour someone arrived and cleaned the tub. He also corroborated the fact that there are two towers and that the hotel has a history of poor service.

The hotel is located on 44th Street and 1st Avenue so not quite in the heart of Manhattan but still in a very good location. 10 mins walk to Grand Central, probably about 20 to Bloomingdales and 25 to Abercrombies/Tiffany/Central Park etc. We were greeted by the doorman who helped us inside with our bags. Reception was efficient rather than friendly but all the bell boys were very helpful and friendly. Our rooms were on the top 38th floor so we had good views facing the Empire State building. The hotel has two towers and our rooms faced partially onto the other tower. However all windows have reflective glass so you have complete privacy. The rooms were good sized with plenty of space. One room had a king bed and the other twins (as requested). Although the rooms were booked on seperate bookings, the hotel had put us close to each other. I'd emailed them to request this. The bedroom was lovely - very comfortable and clean. The TV had a range of TV and pay movies. A desk and chair were provided as well as a sofa. The only negative point about the room furnishings was the lack of a mirror. Two mirrors were provided in the bathroom but this meant that one of us was held up getting ready while the other used the mirrors for make-up and hair. The bathroom was not as nice as the bedroom. Nothing wrong with it other than it needed decorated - rust around the door hinges and cracked ceiling plaster. Minor points and otherwise the bathroom was clean and tidy. Again a good size room with a good shower. Toiletries provided (by Gilchrist & Soames). My one gripe is about the air-conditioning. It's good but noisy. I don't sleep well in noisy rooms and the first night I struggled to sleep. After that it was fine but I don't know whether this just affected our room or was generally the case throughout the hotel. The hotel was busy with tourists from all over the world and airline crews use it as well. It has a tennis court on the 37th floor and a spa and pool on the 28th. Checking out was smooth and both the bell boy and door man went out of their way to make sure we got a SUV taxi back to JFK. They were both really friendly and gave the impression that nothing was too much trouble. The doorman even remembered that we'd been there 6 nights and were from Scotland.

As a brit the downside to the hotel was that it doesn't have tea & coffee facilities in the room.

It was not ready even at 3 p.m. (official check - it time). I was able to get my room only at 4 p.m. It The building looks nice from outside, and the lobby is nice too, but inside - you feel like you are walking Ramada hotel. Not very nice, not very clean. The room has very limited furniture, you feel that one little table at least is missing. The beds are noisy and not comfortable, shaking on the high legs. Don't expect any nice pillows either. Everythign is minimized, but - SURE ENOUGH - you have that expensive mini-bar with the key, so they can charge you more. The toilet is not clean, the actual toilet has dirty stains all over, the water from the sink is leaking, and the water in the shower does not go away. The view howere is terrific, but the window is sealed, you cannot open it so you stay in the air-conditioned room without ay fresh air, and after a night sleeping in such a room your head is heavy and your nose is stuffed, and you have slight cold flu symptoms. I came to the reception and I talked to the Manager Marcos who said that they have other rooms where the window can be indeed open, and he said that they will move me. But = guess what - they did not. WHen I came to the reception again - Marcos was not there, but there was some other girl, and she was rude, she was rolling her eyes like I am asking for a moon from the sky, and she did not even apologize, thus .. it was not very nice. The hotel is full of children, It looks like thay are haveing some group deal overe there, but you do not expect to be right in the middle of the high school when you pay so much for your stay. You feel like you are camping with the bunch of boyscouts. If you do not mind it - sure you can chose this hotel. If you do not mind rude stuff - sure you can chose this hotel. But if you prefer to get a decent service for the money you pay - stay away, this is not a good place. And even your wonderfull view from the sealed window does not help. I also asked for some help to book some tourist tours - and received no assistance. The restaurant is of low quality and sure enough - overpriced. You do not mind to pay more for a good food in NY, but when you pay $60 for piece of meat you expect it to be a good piece at least - but it is not. The food was of Dennis' quality. I would say - this is 2 star motel in a body of high glass building, that's it. THe only advantage is - the location. It is really comfortable.

Amazing discounts to be had at Century 21 . To anyone who is thinking of taking a baby, toddler to NY go for it. We were treated really well by everyone and even the taxi drivers were friendly this time.

This review is a little late arriving but hey, better late than never. :-) My partner and I swapped to this hotel at the last minute from the Grand Hyatt. (fab decision) We arrived around 11am and check in was not until 3pm however, we went to the desk to ask if they could hold our luggage. Much to our surprise they gave us a room key and checked us in at no extra cost. We had previously emailed the hotel to ask if we could have a room on a high floor. (rooms start from floor 29) When we were given floor 29 we were a little disappointed but we thought we'd have a look anyway. Upon entering our room both our jaws dropped! The room was huge by Manhattan standards. It was a corner room with windows all the way around. We could see the UN building, the East River and a complete city view. It was amazing!!! The room was cleaned and serviced every day. Fresh towels, toiletries etc. The staff were great and never hassled for tips. We never used the restaurant but we did use room service for one of our evening meals. Quite pricey and maybe a little on the slow side but certainly nothing unexpected in a large Manhattan hotel. Very tasty though but not something you'd do every night. Situated on 1st Avenue it is a 10 minute walk to Grand Central Station. Close enough to the attractions but far enough out for a little peace and quiet. Overall we had a wonderfull stay, the hotel and service was excellent and we would definitely return. TIPS: There is free wifi in the hotel lobby so DO NOT pay for it in your room. There is a 24 hour Deli just up from the hotel. For breakfast try John's cafe just across from the Deli. If there are any cheesecake lovers out there you MUST try Juniors, there is a counter in Grand Central Station. Another must do is the Circle Line 3 hour cruise from pier 83 12th Avenue, which goes around the whole island of Manhattan. Make sure you sit on the left side of the boat.

The front desk staff was very nice and helpful at the check in. We got a remodeled room and an upgrade to a superior room (we booked standard). We had a nice view from our room but you kind of had to be close to the window to see the Chrysler and Empire State building or you had to lean out in order to take a picture of them. But we liked our room and the view very much. We were located at the 30th floor and after sleeping two nights very well (beds are very comfy) a crackling noise started and woke me up in the middle of the night. It was so loud that I couldn't get back to sleep and I ended up using earplugs. The next day we asked at the front desk what this could be and they told us that we probably just forgot to turn off the ac. But we checked everything that night and it was not the ac. In the evening we asked if somebody could check this noise out in our room since we could still hear it. The maintenance guy stopped by and said this crackling noise is the wind and the hotel received a lot of complaints about that recently. The noise got much quieter the next nights and we didn't bother to ask for another room. The concierge helped us with a restaurant reservation at a very nice Italian restaurant. The only real complaint I have is that I asked several times to get a clean comforter (there was a big stain on ours) and after asking four times and they never changed it I was sick of it and just gave up. Another not very nice situation we had was at the check out. The lady who was helping us asked me to fill out a survey. I told her we are in a rush but we would be happy to fill it out and mail it in or do it online. She responded very rude that this is not an option and grabbed the survey from me. I was very unhappy with her reaction and how she treated me during the entire check out procedure. I have to say that you can forget the ladies at the front desk but the guys are very very nice. They always asked us how we like New York and our stay at the Hotel. If we asked the ladies at the front desk (as I asked for a new comforter) they always gave me the impression that they are really annoyed by our requests and treated us disrespectful.

The bathroom was clean and all, but the temperature of the hot water and the tub itself was kind of so-so. Like, the water never felt hot enough and the lever to turn on the water was kind of in shabby condition. I'm easy to please when it comes to hotel rooms, so like I wasn't distraught at the sort of run down nature of the tub. It was clean so I wasn't put off too badly. Overall the room itself was nice enough. It was oldish looking, but like I liked the spaciousness of the room and the kindness of the staff. I think the only real negative point of the hotel for me was its location. It's not the hotel itself, but the location. Like it's yes within minutes of walking to the Grand Central Station/42nd Street stop subway station, but like I still think it's a bit too far to walk when it's night time or after you've been out already walking and shopping all day...at night it gets really deserted and quiet there and not that it's not safe, but it's just I'd rather not walk four blocks after getting off the subway late at night to get to the hotel. Also like the Saturday I was there, there was apparently some street party or something happening on the main street/sidewalk area that leads to the main hotel entrance. It was extremely noisy and just wall-to-wall people. The policemen wouldn't allow you through unless you showed them a key to your room...I was admittedly really annoyed at this sudden street party or whatever it was. It's like it wasn't even some official UN/important gathering but like some random party. Like I wish we were told by the hotel staff or given a heads up that it would be happening, so we could've avoided having to navigate through throngs of strangers and strange people and have my friend be questioned about truly being a guest at the hotel. It's like it's a public street that leads to a hotel like what if only I was staying at the hotel and I met up with friends and we were just going back to my hotel to go get something. Like why would we all need a room key just to walk down the sidewalk that's blocked because of some stupid random street party? And then there was all this garbage strewn all over the street and sidewalk after it was over....it's like if something like this is going to happen so close to the hotel, then I think the hotel should've told us so we would've known in advance to like use an alternative route to get to/from the hotel.

The queue lines up a bit weird due to the seating area in the middle as someone else mentioned on a previous review but they were very professional and nice. The Concierge was well informed and very helpful. Suggested a couple of places to eat such as Angelos in little italy and we had prolly the best italian dinner in a while. The overall service was great. Location ======= Its only a few blocks (5-7min) walk to Grand central station and across the street from the UN. The area felt safe and there was always security on premises. There are some good choices for dinning out , there was also the Deli up the street, did not eat there but its there if you need something. Try Pinnacle for good bagels and bkfst down between 45th and 47th street. For pizza a block up and to the left try Pizza Rustica.

The hotel on some websites is listed as offering 4 star accommodation. It certainly has some 'higher end' trappings, such as the impressively stocked bar, concierge service and leisure facilities but you will, if you're placed in the west tower, be disappointed by the quality of the room. I'm unaware if there are plans to upgrade all the rooms to the standard of those in the east tower but if this was to be done then a 4 star rating would be appropriate. Given the absence of balconies in most New York hotels it is apparent that smoking is permitted in rooms. I was disappointed that I was not given the option of a smoking or non-smoking room on arrival but I'm unsure if this was available. There was a odour in the room upon our arrival but this soon disappated. I personally wasn't that pertrubed given the aged nature of the room. This is New York City - how much time are you going to spend in there! The views from our room was nothing short of breathtaking and considering this our first visit to NYC we couldn't have asked for anything better. We didn't eat in the hotel restaurant. I believe this hotel to mainly cater for business travellers and the hotel bar and restaurant prices reflect this ($25 for two bottles of beer and a diet coke!). But there are a multitude of eating options in the immediate area and the concierge has no problem in advising various eateries (the concierge called Ferris was particularly helpful). I'd read other reviewers referring to John's Diner and this became our breakfast location everyday. Good quality food, reasonably priced and it is the authentic american diner experience to boot. All rooms boast a mini-bar but prices are high ($7 for a beer) considering the accessability of pharmacies and stores in the immediate area, which offer greater chioce anyway. The hotel's leisure facilities are, besides the rooms views, the major selling point. No other hotel in Manhattan apparently offers a swimming pool and tennis court in it's complex. The pool can get busy early in the day as it's used by staff from the UN as they can purchase membership but after 09.30hrs it is generally quiet. It's a great facility, especially if your travelling with children as we did. There is also a well equipped fitness room with treadmills, cross trainers and weights. In conclusion, the Millennium UN is a great hotel, in a eastern mid-town location, offering various facilities hard to find in Manhattan.

Safe neighborhood. Great views of Midtown or the East River. Clean rooms. Fairly quiet area at night--not much traffic and honking. Close enough to walk to restaurants or take the M15 bus up 1st Ave. to even more. Bad: No express checkout, and only two clerks in the mornings. Huge windows and inadequate blinds let in too much light too early in the morning. Thin walls. Weak air conditioning in some rooms. Old-school TV with annoying noisy channel-changer. No mirror outside the bathroom. Bathroom lightswitch is outside the bathroom--no late-night trips without waking your bedmate. Towels not the fluffiest. Section of window in front of couch actually slides open--beware if you have children, who could easily fall out. Conclusion: Clean, safe, adequate, and convenient--but don't expect luxury or attention to detail, and be prepared for some odd quirks. The hotel very much seems to have been designed for budget-conscious foreign diplomats. The Millennium UN is an adequate hotel. I have no horror stories to tell. Yet there were a host of minor annoyances. First was when I tried to lower the massive shade covering the massive window; I merely pulled on it, and the whole contraption fell down. Maintenance had to reinstall it. Could've been a lawsuit, had it hit me on the head and had I been the lititgious sort. It could've really injured an elderly person. I later saw that the smoke alarm was hanging open, sans battery. The maintenance man later replaced the battery and told me smokers often pull it out--despite the fact that the hotel has tons of smoking rooms. He said it's hard to enforce the no-smoking rule in the other rooms. Is it? Other hotels have a note threatening you with a cleaning fee if they detect smoking. Whatever--a nonworking smoke detector in a hotel full of chain-smoking Chinese diplomats is a bit worrisome. Even more worrisome: the sliding panel in the huge window. The panel is right above the back of the couch. It's easily big enough for a child to crawl through and fall to his/her death. What were they thinking? I had stayed in another room of this hotel a couple of weeks before, and its a/c unit was fine. But in this room, the a/c--even on full blast--was piddling. I had the maintenance guy come up; he made an admirable effort, but for naught. I wasn't sweating--and lowering the shade helped a lot during the day--but it wasn't the 68 degrees I prefer in August. I could hear the conversation of the people in the next room from the bathroom--and I could understand every word. Inside the room itself--near the window--I could hear talking, but not loudly. Even the TV was a bit odd. It was an old convex-screen model, and the channel changer made this very annoying \"thwack\" sound with every channel change. I know that complaint may sound ridiculously picayune, but believe me--it got old fast. And why is the bathroom lightswitch on the outside--like in Japan? If I make a trip early in the morning, I'd rather keep the light off till I have the door shut so I don't wake my wife. But with the switch on the outside, I can't do that. If you stay here, give yourself extra time to check out, because there will be a crowd, and they only have two front-desk clerks. The Millennium isn't a bad hotel--but it's not a great one.

The furniture all had glass tops and wooden cupboards and this theme also extended to the bathroom. We were situated on the corner which gave us pleasant views of the East River and of the Chrysler and Empire State Buildings. The bed was very comfortable and again the room was very spacious.

After coming across the UN plaza, and reading the reviews of the hotel i chose to stay there, and it was the correct decision. The hotel itself although not in a 'prime' location, the location is still more than adequate as Grand Central station is within walking distance. It bugs me when i read poor reviews, when people criticise walking to a place....if this is an issue, do not go to New York as you will walk....ALOT. The hotel itself is clean, and very well presented and the staff were very kind and friendly (they were quick to hand to help when my friend left his bag in a taxi on arrival!.....it was returned by a driver called Kumar..if there is a review site for Taxi drivers, this guy would get 5 stars) the room i stayed in was the best out of the 3 (and this hotel is the cheapest in comparison with my previous 2 stays!). But to be honest when i go to NY i think aslong as the room is clean and disease free thats good enough (unless you are of the higher class, im a 21 yr old student) as you dont spend any time in the hotel really. The view from our floor was amazing, we arrived at night and got a night skyline view of New York, im a bit photo mad and took alot of pictures just from my hotel room. Obviously, not all the reviews will be this positive and im sure there are some rooms that are not as modern etc. but dont let this deter you. I saw one negative review, which mentioned the cost of pistacio nuts being unreasonable...personally in situations where i wanted nuts which is rare i must add, i would buy them from the store which is about a minute walk away from the hotel, but if hotels who over charge for nuts is a concern for you...perhaps you should think twice about staying here..the nuts are over priced. Overall reviews will vary from person to person as these are usually a reflection of the whole vacation, but i cant compliment the UN plaza enough, its a great place to stay and if you ask nicely for a view of the Empire state building etc (i think its room on the west side, but dont quote me) then you will be in for a great vacation.

When we arrived, the desk clerk mentioned that we could only get \"certain rooms\" since we booked thru hotwire. Though, I asked for a high floor, and he did put us on the top floor (40th), so I was happy about that. However, this was NOT a 4 star room at all. It was in tower which has not been remodeled yet. It was a huge room, and had a kitchen with a stove and frige, which was unexpected. It was a very old kitchen though and we had no intention of using it. The floor tile in the bathroom was broken and your foot would catch on it each time you go in. The tub drained so slowly you stood in inches of water to shower. The room smelled strongly of smoke though we asked for nonsmoking. And the worst was the bed- it was so old and hard, and you could feel the springs through the sheet- I truly could not believe it. The next morning I asked for a different room with a \"newer bed\" and we were quickly given a room in the other tower that had been remodeled and was 100 times better! What a relief. It was much smaller, but I did not care- it felt clean and new and nice. We were very happy with that room and the views are wonderful. The tempting snacks on the counter are insane prices- $3.50 for a small bag of m&ms, for example. The staff was wonderful for sure. But, we saw an enormous difference in quality between the 2 rooms, so I strongly suggest requesting a remodeled room if you book here!!", "Date": "July 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cIrish Travellers\u201d", "Author": "MoofiIreland", "ReviewID": "UR8216990", "Content": "Booked this hotel on the basis of location and expected luxurious conditions at over \u00e2\u201a\u00ac200 per night.

The Millennium was NONE of these. The room was spacious, and very clean. It was nicely decorated and very chic. And we had a breathtaking view (35th floor view of the Empire State Building, UN and the East River) and in a nice safe area of downtown. The bed was heavenly-very comfortable. And the staff was very friendly and helpful. Everyone from the front desk staff, to the concierge, to the housekeeping staff, to the doorman, to the foot massage therapist. I also enjoyed use of the business center. There are only 3 minor things I would change: I would make sure there is a little more privacy between computers in the business center; I would move the foot reflexologist into a private room (the massage was excellent, but it was hard to relax with the people passing by going to the gym); and I would book on line through a search engine and earlier.

I had to use the normal phone line and that cost me. I'd have rather texted messages on my phone especially to my family and friends overseas in Australia.

However, housekeeping does wake you up early about 8.30 am! To avoid this, put a sign outside your door saying you don't want to be disturbed. I always eat at Grand Central.

The views are nothing short of breathtaking--especially at night. We had a river view. The hotel is located just a three block walk from Grand Central Station and about a 30 minute (lesiurely) walk from Times Square. It is far enough from Times Square to be away from the hustle and bustle, but cose enough to be accessible. You can even take a subway from Grand Central to Times Square if you like. The staff was very friendly. We especially liked one of the doormen, named Eddie. Unlike others, we did not get an upgrade when we arrived. I would think that over a weekend, they were available, but they were not offered. We didn't ask, so we assume part of the responsibility. The lobby looks very elegant with lots of black and emerald green marble. There are also lots of mirrors. The rooms are light and bright with a contemporary feel. We thought they wewren't as clean as they could be. There was hair in the bathtub and the tile showed signs of mildew. It looked like the floor hadn't been mopped. The walls had lots of scuff marks on them. These are little things that we would not expect from a hotel of this caliber. It definitely has 4 star potential, but they need to keep it up. There is a small fitness center and a nice size indoor swimming pool. Both have awesome views. There is also an indoor tennis court. Snacks are in the room and there is a mini bar at the expected exhorbinant (sp) prices. No vending machines in the hotel, but there is a delie two or three doors away from the hotel if you want to purchase snacks. Internet access is available for a fee. I guess I would say that in terms of amenities, I have gotten more for my money at cheaper hotels, but in terms of the facility and the views, this was a good bargain.

We have stayed in other hotels in New York which were a bit smarter and/or cheaper but chose this one for the views - and we were thrilled with our decision. OK, some of the hotel's decoration scheme is a little dated - a bit 80s - wonderful if you like looking at yourself in mirrors all the time, but we asked to be in the best tower for the view, so we knew from the reviews that we mightn't be getting a refurbished room. The best bit for us though, was that we were upgraded and given a 2 bedroom suite instead of the 2 rooms originally booked. This meant we had a triangular living room that is situated in the south facing pointy part of the West tower and had simply wonderful views both sides. Through our full length windows we could see the East River and the UN, across to Brooklyn, south along the FDR, the Williamsburg, Manhattan and Verrazano Bridges, down to the World Financial Center and all of midtown Manhattan. The 2 bedroom suite had 3 bathrooms (!), a kitchenette and living/dining room. The main bedroom is huge and has its own seating area and approximately 8 double wardrobes (one with a washing machine in it!) as well as umpteen drawers and that was just in the main room (I think we had all Tallbloke7's storage -sorry!) The kitchenette means that you have a giant fridge of your own, but you have to pay extra if you want any utensils other than a few glasses. The kitchenette has its own window and therefore must be the best place in the world to do washing up. The beds were incredibly comfortable, and the rooms were kept clean (despite us leaving stuff all over the place - we are a messy bunch) Every member of staff we came across was helpful, friendly and welcoming - thanks especially to reception staff (Sarah?) for checking us in quickly despite arriving at the same time as a coach party.

So we called the front desk and talked to a manager who send us up one free of charge. Also there are NO ice machines. You have to have a bucket sent to your room. Another ploy to make money. The man actually stood at my door staring at me from accross the room for a tip. I have no problem with tipping, but lets get real folks....its frozen water!

Plaza during the Easter weekend. This hotel has a very uneven quality. The hotel is located off the beaten path, which is a good and a bad thing. The Grand Central subway station is a good 20 minutes walk away. It's located very near the United Nations of course, and there are numerous U.N. foreign missions or consulates in the area. It's a very secure and quiet area, not very commercial either. The service from the staff is excellent, but I found the cleaning service a bit lazy in the corners... Tip: If you come by car, don't use the valet service at $45 a day, but park on 45th street, there is an appartment building with parking spaces for $32.95 per day. The amenities in the rooms are somewhat nonexistant: no bathrobe, no slippers, no razor or toothbrushes, only tiny soapbars and microscopic shampoo bottles. The TV set was very old, early-nineties looking. Disapointing. The mattress was also uncomfortable and the bedsheets did not include a contour sheet (with the elastic fit), which I found very surprising. We kept trying not to end up directly sleeping on the mattress surface... The best features of this hotel are the view (Northeast, East and SouthEast, depending on the room) and the health club, which comprises a sauna and a pool with a panoramic view towards the East (Queens, Brooklyn) and the South (Midtown and downtown Manhattan). Hope this review helps you.

Also, ask for more than one towel when you check into the pool as they are so small - we girls need one for our hair and one for our toes!!

Ask the concierge to provide coffee making facilities - we did and they gave us a nice pot and filter coffee each morning. Put the tray outside the door as room service do not remove it - you will not be charged for this. Really recommend Ellen's Diner up at Times Square for something to eat - the waiting staff sing all through your meal and they are all really good - great atmosphere and not too dear - good night out.

We had a great stay; I think one's happiness with this hotel depends a lot on what you're looking for. So, here are the outstanding features which, if important to you, will make you love this hotel. First, the POOL. If you have kids who enjoy a hotel pool, or need to get your daily swim in, stay here. I thoroughly researched pools in Manhattan hotels before our trip. There are a total of seven pools in all of Manhattan's hotels and except for this one, they ALL close by 7:30 or 8 pm, and may even require lap swimming (no pool play) and swim caps. The Millenium pool, however, is open until 10 pm. The water is warm, the view of the skyline and river breathtaking, and the shower/locker room facilities extremely nice. Your kids (or you) can splash around or use your own pool toys with no restrictions, and there are nice lounge chairs all around the pool for watching. They provide towels too! Next - the quiet! Yes, it's true the hotel isn't in midtown but that's a plus; it's so nice to be able to leave the hotel and walk along the river and hear something besides honking horns. I was so grateful to not have to \"hear New York\" around the clock. People have already written about the stupendous views and the very spacious rooms. We stayed in the East Tower, which has been \"remodeled,\" and although the rooms are simple they are huge and comfortable, with a well stocked mini-bar. And, the staff were exceptionally courteous. The few things that are \"less than perfect:\" unfortunately they don't have \"in room\" coffee, but since I knew that ahead of time I brought a small \"Mr. Coffee\" pot and some coffee and just made our own. Next: parking. Always a problem in New York. However, the hotel is on 44th, and right around the corner on 45th, a two minute walk, is a garage where we left the car. This also saves you a lengthy wait to get your car if you use the hotel's valet parking. We found the hotel to be really lovely in all respects, especially since having a pool for kids to play in was high on our list of \"must have's.\" So if a pool, a view, peace and quiet, a helpful staff, and a room big enough to really move around in are what makes your hotel stays worth it, you absolutely won't be disappointed by staying here.", "Date": "March 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cardiff, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic View but let down by the bathroom....\u201d", "Author": "IANTOJONES", "ReviewID": "UR7225623", "Content": "I had mixed feelings about this hotel - there were positives and negatives. Firstly, the view was amazing. We had a room on the 28th floor in the East Tower. This meant that we have a great view over the East River but also the Chrysler and Empire State Buildings! This was a highlight in itself. The most positive aspect was the size of the room. It was pretty big. So many hotels in NYC have the tiniest rooms, but this was a really good size. The room was basic but perfectly adequate. One of the beds was pretty bad and rocked constantly, but it was my choice not too bother reporting this to reception. The biggest let down was the bathroom. Quite frankly it was disgusting. The room needed a really good deep clean. It stunk of cigarette smoke, the skirting boards were black with grime, there were no end of hairs that did not belong to us appearing, the shower was poor and the general hygiene was very poor. The bathroom also looked as though it had not been included when the room was renovated. Apart from the bathroom, I was generally happy with the hotel. We did not eat there as the prices were ridiculous even for NYC! The reception staff were great and extended our check out until 3pm which really made a difference on the last day.

There are restaurants in easy walking distance and a variety of food to choose from.

After feeling some trepidation because of a few negative reviews on TripAdvisor, I went ahead and changed to the Millennium. I have to say that my partner and I were delighted with our stay. Unlike the reviewer on December 30, we had a very easy time checking in, perhaps because it was on Christmas Day, and we were given a king superior room on the top floor (38th). The room was huge with fabulous north-facing views of the city. Furnishings were plain but stylish in the Scandinavian style, the bathroom was large, and we actually had a walk-in closet. The staff was very friendly and seemed eager to please. The location, while somewhat off the beaten track, turned out to be the perfect antidote to the horrific crowds in New York between Christmas and New Year's...so the hotel was a blessed refuge from the tumult on the streets.

Do: buy a New York City pass - saves money and time for getting into attractions; try the Circle Line Harbour Lights cruise in the evening; Liberty Helicopters - not cheap but well worth it; see Wicked at the Gershwin Theatre - it'll blow you away; spend time in Central Park; go to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and have a drink on the roof garden, for fab views of Central Park.

First I'll start off with the 1% negative aspect of the hotel: the elevators. These elevators SUCK. They are SO SLOOOWWW!!! My goodness. In the West Tower, one of the three elevators was working on the first day (two were working the next, the middle elevator were out of service long-term for rehabilitation). When you have one elevator serving 40 floors, that's a recipe for disaster. I saw a man who was just rescued from the service elevator next to the main elevators after being stuck in it! After seeing this I prayed to God that my family and I would have a room in the East Tower. Sure enough, to my relief, we were given a room in the East Tower on the 33rd floor. The East Tower had four elevators, with the one farthest on the right being out of service long term for rehabilitation. But the problems continued. I had just missed the middle-right elevator next to the out-of-service one. I waited for several minutes for the next one, which annoyed me. However, when we reached our floor (33rd), we learned that the people in the elevator we just missed were stuck inside! Had we arrived a split-second earlier we would've not missed that elevator and we would've been stuck too. Scary! That elevator was taken out of service, so the only working ones were the two on the left. Two elevators serving 40 floors=Very long waits (5 minutes+) for us during the rest of our stay. I only used the elevator once more. All the elevators in the hotel are currently undergoing a long-term rehabilitation project, so expect wait times to be long until it is complete. Now that that's out of the way, I'll move on to the other 99% of the hotel, all of which was amazing. We drove up from DC to the hotel to check in for one night (I was staying for one night because I had to catch a plane the next day, the rest of my family stayed another night). It started raining just as we pulled up to the hotel. The entrance was hard to find; we were driving up 1st Avenue but it turns out the entrance to the hotel is on 44th St, which is a one way street east only, so we had to go west on 45th St, south on 2nd Av, and then east on 44th (three left turns). Next time, if we are coming from the south again, we will go up 3rd Av instead of 1st (a good tip to remember). The hotel's location on 44th St between 1st and 2nd Avs is actually quite convenient, believe it or not. The nearest subway station is Grand Central-42nd St, two and a half long blocks west and two short blocks south, where you can catch the Metro-North commuter railroad to Westchester County and Connecticut, the Shuttle S train to Times Square, the 7 train to Queens and Times Square, and the 4/5/6 trains up Lexington Av or down Park Av. It's actually not too long of a walk, 10 minutes at the most. Plus, you get to walk through a quiet, charming, peaceful residential neighborhood. A couple of bus routes run right by the hotel as well, so transportation is not a problem. I liked the fact that there was no street noise in the hotel room, due to its location in a quiet neighborhood. We got out of the car and a friendly gentleman ran into the rain and grabbed all our heavy bags. He was very strong. Check in was about the average wait time; not too long, but by no means short. All the staff we encountered on our trip were very kind and friendly, especially to my brother, who has a mental disorder. After the elevator adventure to the 33rd floor, my brother and I entered our room and our jaws dropped the moment we opened the door. The room was spotless, nicely decorated, and it was HUGE by New York standards! This is also the case at the other Millenium hotel in New York (the Millenium Broadway Hotel on 44th St between 6th Av and Broadway, right off Times Square, also a fabulous hotel). I plopped down on the quite comfortable bed. The bathroom was average sized. The only complaint about the room was the shower: It had a portable showerhead that you had to hold in your hand, kind of inconvenient when you are trying to rub your body with soap! Other than that, the room was perfect. But the highlight of the Millenium UN Plaza is without question, far-and-away the VIEW! If I could rate the view from my hotel room on the 33rd floor on a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give it a FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. You get the idea. Our room looked straight down 1st Av, looking south. Turn your head an inch to the right and you're looking across the East River into Brooklyn. The view was so amazing and clear, we could see the Brooklyn Bridge, which is many miles south from the hotel. Turn your head an inch to the right, and you're looking at the entire Manhattan skyline below 44th St. Looking at the Empire State Building lit up at night (can't remember the color) and the Chrysler Building in one picture without having to turn my head was breathtaking. Watching the 4th of July weekend fireworks over the East River was mind-boggling. I only wish I had my camera! Silly me. I did not eat at the hotel restaurant, but I ate breakfast instead at a little place nearby (I can't remember the name, but it might be John's). Very good eggs and corned beef hash! I am sorry this review was so long but everything in it has to be said. I had a fantastic time.

I almost expected John Travolta to sashay across the lobby after reading some OTT comments about its decor .. this is NEW YORK, not a Buddhist monastery! So no need for sunglasses, its glitzy, thats all. The ONLY disappointment re; this hotel was I had emailed requesting a city view but our rooms faced the East River instead. Still .. a lot better view than a brick wall. No problems waiting for the elevators - there was also a courtesy phone beside the elevators to contact reception in case of delays, due to maintenance, and a staff member would arrive to escort guests in the service lift but this was never necessary. Rooms were absolutely fine, okay slightly faded 80's, including the Magnavox TV's, but hey, the 80's retro look is in. Tiling around the baths looked a little tired however unless you are the type of hygiene-obsessive person who carries a bottle of bleach and toothbrush to spend your holiday scrubbing tiles, not a problem. Initially, the interconnecting door between our rooms was locked but literally three minutes after a phone call to Reception, a staff member arrived to remedy the situation. Housekeeping was top class, rooms were immaculate upon our return each day and all the staff, from Frank, the friendly porter who stowed our luggage on our final day to the helpful lady in the gift shop (lots of last minute gifts found here), were exceptionally polite. Very quiet location, never heard any street noise and lots of security personnel with sniffer dogs in the vicinity too, (hardly surprising with the UN Buildings literally across the street) so felt very safe. One of the other narrowed-down choices was the Grand Hyatt - certainly more central and right next door to Grand Central station but feel the Plaza was a more peaceful location to return to after a busy day's sightseeing. Turn right on leaving the hotel, a brisk 10 minute stroll has you right at Grand Central station and a host of subway routes. Yes, the 10 minutes felt longer in the evening, especially with shopping bags!, but look out for the Lexington Avenue exit from Grand Central and this really shortens the journey. There are always taxis outside this hotel too. A handy Deli just up the street, several supermarkets and a Duane Reade drugstore on Second Avenue and Johns Diner on the corner of 44th and 2nd Avenue give plenty of options for stocking up on coffee/essentials/or if you dont feel like splurging in the hotel's Ambassador Grill restaurant. Practically every previous review for this hotel mentioned John's Diner so we dined there several times .. food was okay to be perfectly frank and at busy times, it felt like a 'get 'em in, get 'em out' conveyor belt but it was convenient.

The views of New York from here were incredible, both at sunrise and during the evenings. The decor was less tired than the first room too. Both rooms were very spacious, and the beds were very comfortable. We didn't have any problems with the room temperature as mentioned in previous reviews. Our tower had 3 lifts, though only one was working throughout our stay leading to some quite long waits - about 5 minutes on average We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel, choosing to walk to the end of the block to eat in the excellent Johns Cafe. The service here was fast, friendly and helpful - the waitresses were happy to give tips on sights to see and the cheapest ways to get round the city. The hotel staff were very friendly, and couldn't do enough to help. We'd highly recommend a trip to the reflexology section of the fitness club - Rose is a star and really knows how to relieve tired feet that have been walking the streets of NYC! One last word of warning - we didn't have a guest pack in our room so were unaware of the cost of phone calls. As I'd forgotten my mobile we made two 5 min calls back to the UK and would have been charged $60 for this had I not complained. Summary - great views, friendly staff, adequate but not spectacular rooms. Probably about the right value for the price we paid - $229 a night booked on the internet, which was $70 cheaper than I was quoted by the reservations team on the phone...", "Date": "March 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cVery Comfortable Hotel With a Great View\u201d", "Author": "jayirwin", "ReviewID": "UR4579684", "Content": "My husband and I spent a very enjoyable weekend at the Millennium UN Plaza in mid winter 2006.

We studied the map and worked out that the hotel was in a quiet location and the hotel is located above two office towers, starting at level 27, so it was well above the street noise. We booked a Deluxe King room and were on level 37 which is the second top floor. The cost was great. $325 for the first night then $165 the rest of the night because it was low season for the Millennium with the UN not in session. It was a nice big room, really comfy king bed and quite large bathroom. We had an excellent view uptown of the river and skyscrapers. The windows are double glased but you can open them and it was so quiet, that we slept with the window open one night. It was great to get some fresh air! The concierge was very helpful. I called a week before we arrived and they organised a car to pick us up from the airport and likewise when we left. We didn't bother with the hotel breakfast and went to John's diner which is on corner up from the hotel on 2nd Ave. Classic American breakfast, quick and pleasant service. If you walk up to the high 50s and 60th Street on 2nd Ave, there are some good local restaurants from an easy going bar like Press Room to more upmarket restaurants. As this is a residential area, we found the service and food to be far superior to the standard midtown restaurants catering predominantly to tourists. The chinese across the road was surprisingly good and we went there twice. The location of the Millennium is excellent for the tourist who likes walking.

This year our deal was the Millenium UN Plaza, directly across the street from the UN on the East River. What a wonderful treat! Fortunately, I had read reviews on TripAdvisor and knew to ask for a room in the renovated West Tower. Our room (3637) was beautiful, decorated in muted Asian decor. The bath was huge, with polished marble floors, fantasitic lighting, and mucho counter space. The closets are huge and there are many built in bureaus drawers plus big mirrors. Best of all the large bedroom has a huge floor to ceiling picture window looking out over the Empire State Bldg, the Chevron Bldg and Grand Central Station. At night we turned off all the lights, turned the arm chairs around and just gazed over the awesome skyline spread out below us. I must say the staff at the UN Millenium seems genuinely warm. They always recognized us and greeted us by name. Also out front are security TSA agents and bomb sniffing dogs. I had a grand time making friends with the dogs, and it made me feel very secure to know that all those beefy cops were guarding the entrance. The lobby is odd, and needs to be updated. The floor is highly polished green and white marble, the walls and black with chrome and scads of bare lightbulbs. Also lots of mirrored surfaces. It can be a little too much like a fun house; confusing and disconcerting. The lobby furniture is under stated and elegant; I hope that they tone down the lighting to match this. The pool and health club have awesome views of the East River. You can jump on a treadmill or eliptical machine and work out with floor to ceiling views of the East River. The pool is lovely and features insane views down the East River. It is kind of Sixties retro decor with a black, chrome and aqua motif. I loved our renovated room in the West Tower, but I felt that I owed it to you folks to check out the East Tower, so I got a key and looked at a room. The rooms in the East Tower are somewhat dingy, not nearly as nice as the West Tower. They smell musty and the wallpaper was filled with holes and are marred and banged up. The views over the East River should be sweeping and grand, but the windows are much smaller on this side, so you can't lie in bed and just glory in the view. We like to walk so we walked the four long blocks to Grand Central Station.

As advised on trip advisor we had requested the east tower and we got just that!Our room was very spacious 2 big comfortable beds nice furnishings and the bathroom was pristine.The view was out of this world in fact i think we probably had the best views of any hotel in new york.Our room overlooked the chyrsler building and the empire state building if you want the same thing ask for the east tower and a room with a west view.Smoking and non smoking rooms are available aswell.The room had a walk in wardrobe with an iron and ironing board and the bathroom had a powerfull hairdryer.If you are going to the states dont bother taking your hair straighteners or curling tongs they won't work very well with the voltage,we bought a pair of straighteners over there.A lot of people have complained that there is a fridge in the room but it is locked,thats true but you just need to ask at reception for the key!We emptied the mini bar and put our own food and drinks in the fridge.Whatever you do do not order from room service or have anything from the mini bar its mega expensive,over \u00c2\u00a33 for a can of coke.whenever you order room service on top of the price on the menu you are charged a 15% gratuity fee and $2 pp in room charge, to give you an idea a pot of tea for one person was $11 approx \u00c2\u00a37 and then you always tip $2-3 dollars on top of that.Again many people complained there were no tea or coffee making facilities in the room this again was true but on our second day there i asked at reception and they told me to ring room service as they have a limited number of coffee/tea machines.This we did and within 15 mins a coffee machine arrived at our room and we were not charged anything for it.A few doors up from the hotel is a grocery shop which sells coffee,tea bags,milk, sandwiches salads etc and it stays open till around 10pm.As mentioned in other reviews we ate breakfast most mornings at johns diner across the road from the hotel the food was fresh tasty and reasonably priced.Another big plus about this hotel is the area it is in-quiet which is great we had a good nights sleep every night.Grand central station is honestly around a 6 minute walk from the hotel and from here you can catch a subway anywhere,times square around 20 mins walk and madison gardens 15 mins.If you find it too cold to walk you can flag a cab and they are not too expensive. As for people writing bad reviews on the gym i really wonder if we were staying in the same hotel or possibly the gym and pool has had a big makeover.The pool was warm and clean and had fab views and the gym was a good size for a hotel and all the equipment looked new and up to date, i use a JJB sports gym at home which is brand spanking new and to be honest the equipment in the hotel was almost the same as there. The staff were mostly polite and helpful we had no complaints.Frank the doorman was especially helpful. All in all we had a fantastic time in new york and i think the fact we stayed in such a nice hotel made all the difference.After visitng times square we were so pleased that we were not in a hotel in that area as it was so NOISY!If we go back to New York which i imagine we will we will stay at this hotel.If you are thinking of booking this hotel and you think its too expensive bear in mind you get what you pay for,as a travel agent i was aware of many other lower rating hotels that were a lot cheaper but i didnt want to go all that way and then have a dump of a hotel.", "Date": "December 3, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cMillenium UN Plaza\u201d", "Author": "Jinnet", "ReviewID": "UR4094560", "Content": "Excellent hotel - delighted with our 2 bathroomed suite.

And then there were the much ballyhooed views. On the other hand, several users complained about disagreeable service and diminished room quality. Just returned, and I'm glad to say that the place lived up to its enthusiastic reviews. Room (on 34th floor, north side) was indeed quiet, had a great view. The staff were all friendly and accommodating. Heeding tripadvisor comments, I asked for and received a room in the new tower; it was nicely appointed. Very comfortable bed. The walk to the subway at Grand Central takes only 10 minutes. Walking is one thing I love to do in NYC; not a problem for me. Yes, the prices at the hotel's restaurant are outrageous. But there's no need to pay them. Again following tripadvisor advice, I ate breakfast in John's Diner, on the corner of 2nd and 44th. I also picked up some delicious take-out at the new Amish Market (nothing particularly Amish about it, as far as I could tell, except for the countrified decor), on E. 45th, just west of 2nd Avenue. Lots of tempting things to eat there. I should have brought a bathing suit, so I could have checked out the pool. Next time. Two things I would have liked that I didn't get: faster elevators in the morning (the wait can be very long), and a mini-refrigerator in my room (there was one, but it was locked).

We would ordinarily have stayed in a more centrally located hotel but we were meeting friends who previously had stayed at this hotel and liked it. I asked for, and received a corner room on the thirty-eighth floor. The view was spectacular and the room, with two full beds, was large and comfortable. Be prepared for dizzying mirror overload when you walk in the lobby and other public rooms of the Millennium. Everything - Everything ! - is covered in mirrors and reflecting surfaces. I don't find it attractive, but some expensive designer did, so who am I to quibble. The irony is that despite the abundance of mirrored surface throughout the public spaces, there was not a single mirror in the room itself. The bathroom, of course, is plastered in mirror, but it all becomes steamed up with use, and it would be nice to use a dry mirror in the room. In protest, I was tempted to shave in the lobby when this occurred. The staff was friendly, and when we called on one occasion for some more hangers they were immediately delivered with a smile. Later, when we called again to have the safe opened someone came within half an hour. Maid service was unobtrusive and responsive during the entire stay. There is Ethernet Internet service in the room, but charged at $10 per 24 hour period, which on this occasion I shrugged off as I had gotten such a good rate on the room. Except for the food service, mentioned below, I can say the stay at the hotel was very comfortable. The beds are good, and their was very little noise either from outside or inside. The hotel is on the east side of Manhattan, directly across from the UN building, so the area is heavily populated by diplomatic staff and a good measure of security personnel as well. You will hear every language in and around this hotel. The area is a good one, despite being somewhat inconvenient to subways and a long walk to museums and shopping. The residential areas around are very nice, and there is a healthy scattering of restaurants and small grocery shops within easy walking distance. To our delight, we found some excellent restaurants nearby, including Jubilee on 54th Street (the hotel is on 44th St) and L'Impero in Tudor City, right around the block from the hotel. We also found a very nice small French restaurant called Deux Amis on 51st St, between 1st and 2nd Avenue nearby. Above all, avoid any food service at the hotel itself, unless it comes with your room. In our case, it did not, and we were shocked at the heavily marked up prices for room service, breakfast and dinner at the Millennium. Believe me, I am from Miami, a tourist city, and I have traveled enough to know outrageous prices for food when I see it. The area around the hotel is loaded with reasonably priced, attractive restaurants nearby, and for breakfast you can't beat the Columbian coffee and take out food at small deli-grocery shops right next to, or up on 2nd Avenue a block away. You soon become aware that almost anyone staying in this hotel not on the UN dole is bringing in their breakfast each day. I will give the UN Plaza Millennium Hotel three stars here. It would be more but for the horrifying food prices and location away from so much of the cities transportation and shopping.

The hotel is located on the East side by the river and about 10 minutes walk in what seemed like a good district to Grand Central station and from there you can get anywhere. We were very disappointed with this hotel. It was our most expensive hotel on the trip and if we hadn't read on Trip Advisor some months earlier about the refurbished block at the Millennium we would have packed our bags and left (Thanks TA!). We tried two rooms before asking if we could look at one in the refurbished block. They are significantly better, unfortunately we're not sure how you identify them other than to say if your lift block is behind reception rather than past the little shop then you're in the wrong block! The old rooms are shabby and the furniture is very worn, we'd even go as far as saying battered. In the new ones there is a modern decor theme and they feel much cleaner. However, that said they are poorly put together, clearly a very cheap and unskilled outfitter did the work. The views from the rooms are very good, there's no doubt. Swimming so high up with the Chrysler and Empire State buildings is quite an experience but even the pool needs some TLC much like the rest of the hotel. We really can't believe the rave reviews this hotel gets. The only thing we can think of is that you don't get much for your money in NY and it was our first trip here. Having said that we checked out what became our second choice hotel while we were there the 'Red Roof Inn' and it was much cheaper and easily as well appointed as the Millennium. Interestingly there were a lot of well dressed people and business people at this hotel which given our view of the hotel seemed a little odd, but in some ways it was reassuring. We didn't want to mention our first impressions of the guy on the desk but we will anyway. His suit literally had holes in the elbow and it looked like it had been ironed on a temperature that was far too hot for the fabric creating a bubble effect. Not the sort of impression we were expecting of a hotel that claims to be 4 star. While his appearance was an initial shock, it has to be said he was extremely pleasant and helpful in letting us view other rooms and finally securing our place in the refurbished block. We'd definitely try somewhere else on our next NY trip. It's a good location but let down by everything else.

I searched the internet and read the reviews on this site before making a decision. The positive reviews as well as the hotel's location on the East Side (near the bridge and tunnel to Queens) were deciding factors. The hotel's web site showed a room with twin beds available for about $239. I decided to make the reservation by phone rather than online to make sure they reserved a room with two beds. During our conversation, I asked the reservation clerk if they offered a cheaper government rate (I'm a federal employee) even though I was not traveling on government business. He said yes, bring your ID, and you'll get the room for $200 plus tax. I requested an email confirmation, which was forwarded promptly. The next day I emailed Brian, the reservation clerk, asking for a room in the renovated tower with views of the city (per suggestions by viewers here.) He responded quickly and confirmed the room assignment request. Well, I must say we loved the hotel and the room (34th floor). Service was excellent. We were allowed to check in early (around noon). The room was contemporary, light and airy. Bathroom was splendid, with the best lighting I've ever seen (recessed behind a mirror, with a pinkish glow). A southwest view of the city, including the Empire State Building, was partially obscured by the adjacent tower. However, the mirrored glass of that tower reflected the city's lights at night, and it was beautiful. Our favorite hotel amenity was the fitness center. The exercise room, though small, has the best assortment of machines and weights that I've ever seen in a hotel, and they were in perfect condition. As others have mentioned, the room has views of the East River and Manhattan to the north. Some reviewers noted poor maintenance at the swimming pool, but it looked pretty swell to me. Even the locker room was attractive: marble walls, several shower stalls with dressing areas, sauna, free use of bath and shampoo products. Ask the desk clerk for towel and lock for the locker; no extra charge. The only drawback to the hotel -- also noted by other reviewers -- is the lack of cafe or bar. Both John's Cafe and the Bakers Dozen (no table seating here) are fine for breakfast, but I'm sure there are many other comparable places within walking distance. There's a good convenience store down the street from the hotel for snacks and beverages. We had a tasty, cheap dinner at a Chinese noodle joint on 2nd Avenue around 47th St. (12 bucks for two, no atmosphere.)

After reading several NYC hotel reviews I was very scared, to say the least, when it came to determining our lodging accommodations. Not to mention, my beau is very very VERY particular about hotels, especially when it comes to the cleanliness of the bathrooms. We wound up getting a rate of $219 a night for the Millennium UN Plaza. Pricey, compared to what I see some folks have paid for this place, but having booked only 3 weeks out..thought it was worth it. So now to the review: **LOCATION** Not too bad at all. Its 3 blocks from Grand Central and is a 10-15 min walk to Time Square. You can also take the \"S\" Shuttle from GC one stop if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to walk. The hotel is directly across the street from the UN, which was cool as that was one of the places we wanted to visit on this trip. The neighborhood where the hotel is located is very nice and quiet with a deli, market and a few restaurants very close. We felt very secure and didn't have to contend with the hustle / bustle and continuous horn honking at night which was a good thing when u're looking to get a good nights sleep after being dead tired from being out ALLL day in NYC. **HOTEL STAFF** We found the hotel staff to be very helpful and accommodating. Melissa at the front desk was quite patient when I called the morning of our check in to get directions to the hotel. We were allowed to check in to the hotel early (12noon) and were also able to have a late check out (2pm). Ana the Concierge was most helpful as was Ozzie the bellman. Overall everyone spoke when they saw us and were pleasant, not common of most New Yorkers. **ROOM 3420** When I first walked in the room I definitely let out a sigh of relief. I was pleased to see a normal sized hotel room, modern decor and the amazing view.....even from the door, which was magnificent. Overall, I'd give the room a B+ and here's why. There was a tear in the rug, the sofa in the room had nice fluffy pillows but looked a little worn on the cushions. Also, the ceiling when you walk into the bathroom could stand to be cleaned, it was nastly. The bathroom however was really clean and to the liking of my beau. It was spacious and bright and had no signs of mold any where :-). Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the Millennium UN Plaza Hotel and would surely stay here again. If you're like us and a hotel skeptic.....you will be pleased with MUN. By the way, I was in the east tower which is supposed to be the renovated tower, so ask for that side of hotel.

It's not at all! Five minutes takes you to Grand Central, buy a Metrocard pass for the week (usually 14-21 dollars) and just take the subway shuttle that goes back and forth between Times Square and Grand Central. You can be in the heart of Manhattan in 10 minutes while only walking about 3 or 4 blocks. My friend and I planned on getting up every day around 10, but the beds were so comfortable that earliest we could get up was noon. The pillows are the best and the sheets and mattress are so comfortable that you don't want to leave. I would recommend taking the Coach USA shuttle to and from the airports. Only costs about 10 bucks, and it will pick you up and drop you off at Grand Central station. If you have a lot of luggage, just have the front desk staff or airport customer service call up Super Shuttle that will take you right to the front door of your hotel for $14.

Yes, it was a tad shabby around the edges (after all, it WAS in the tower where rooms hadn't been remodeled yet), but when you get a suite with TWO beautiful views (one toward the U.N. tower and the East River, the other toward the Chrysler and Empire State Building), two full baths, a kitchen, about 50 mirrors, 30 drawers, 3 television sets, 3 telephones, 2 refrigerators (including the minibar) etc. etc. etc., one can only be overwhelmed!

Would definiely stay here again.", "Date": "January 4, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montgomery, AL", "Title": "\u201cMillennium UN better than The Plaza\u201d", "Author": "wendigo", "ReviewID": "UR2946188", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Millennium UN Plaza hotel only 2 nights, Dec. 17 and 18, before we checked out and went across town to stay at the famous Plaza Hotel with a group of friends. The Millinnium UN Plaza far exceeded The Plaza in accommodations, friendly and efficient staff, and VIEW! We had a room on the 36th floor, with a terrific view of the East River, 1st Street, and much of the city. The room was very large and the bed was huge and very comfortable. Nice big bathroom, although the plumbing was a little old and we had a few minor problems with the drains in the shower and sink. Nothing major, though. Huge closet, lots of drawer space. Upon check-in, we had a porter bring our bags up to our room, and he was very helpful in providing suggestions about how to get around the city, even pulling out our in-room map and marking the location of the closest subway and highlighting the various attractions in different parts of town to let us know what we might enjoy seeing and doing. SUPER! We discovered we had no TV remote control and after a call to the front desk had a remote delivered to our room within 5 minutes, and the bellman even stayed to make sure it worked with our TV. We enjoyed the hotel's location, although it was a bit far East Side, but just a short walk to Grand Central to catch the subway, and the bellman was happy to flag a cab for us as well. We enjoyed the fact that there were lots of little pubs and restaurants around the hotel for a quick bite, as opposed to busy, huge, \"theme\" restaurants in some other parts of the city. All in all, a great stay, and we got a very good deal on price. I would definitely recommend this hotel!", "Date": "December 27, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nottingham,uk", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, fantastic views!\u201d", "Author": "Britishclaire", "ReviewID": "UR2943108", "Content": "We stayed for a week from December 12th and were not disappointed by this hotel. We found all the staff to be polite and courteous and our room was lovely. We were on the 34th floor and had great views uptown and towards the east river - exceptional at all times of day and night. The room was very quiet indeed and our bed was huge and really comfortable. We liked the fact that it was slightly away from Times Square as we were there at a busy time of year. Grand Central, where you could get the subway to most areas, is a 10 minute pleasant walk away, and the other attractions were mostly within easy walking distance. There are always taxis outside and buses on 2nd Ave. Johns is great for breakfast -just down the road and the deli on the corner sold pretty much everything you'd need day to day. We didn't use the pool or gym -too exhausted - but both looked good, if a bit small, and had amazing views too. 2 tiny negative points - check your bill thoroughly when you leave. They'd tried to charge us for a $140 trip which we didn't take but sorted it out quickly and courteously. Also, would have liked tea/coffee making facilities in the room. I know you could get them from room service but it would have been nice. Overall, a great stay. This hotel and the views really helped to make our trip so enjoyable. Would definitely stay there again.", "Date": "December 24, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Millennium UN Plaza Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d209382-Reviews-Millennium_UN_Plaza_Hotel-New_York_City_New_York.html", "Price": "$276 - $490*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">One United Nations Plaza</span>, <span class=\"extended-address\">44th Street (Between First and Second Avenue)</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New York City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NY</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">10017-3575</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "209382", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/16/de/16de135009558f8dc2016b0a06af2ad93large.jpg"}}
