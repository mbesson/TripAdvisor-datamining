The location is great \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and not very far from a vaporetto stop (San Marco Vallaresso). When we arrived, we rang the bell at the entrance and the receptionist said over the intercom that she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be with us in one minute. She came from the sister hotel next door (Hotel Violino D\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Oro) and was actually with us in less than a minute to check us in. That we had to pop into the other reception with any enquiries did not trouble us at all \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you have to walk past the door practically every time you go out. All the staff we came across were brilliant \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nothing was too much trouble to make our stay comfortable. We nearly always have to ask for an extra mattress to make beds higher up for my husband to manage and at this hotel they made the whole bed up to a higher level for us (usually we just have one single mattress added \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is perfectly ok \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but this was much better!) Our room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no. 305 on the third floor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was beautiful, quite spacious and very comfortable. There was a flat-screen TV, safe and mini-bar in the room. The lovely bathroom had an over-bath shower with plenty of hot water. A bit of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmopping up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 was needed after a shower where the water seeped over the side but I adjusted the shower head so it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen again. We were blessed with unexpected warm weather during our stay and we had to have the windows open overnight. Unfortunately, we were cursed with an unexpected mosquito in the room! I woke up with bites on my hand and face (I already had a bite on my arm from the previous day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not in the hotel). I called into reception on our way out and asked could they possibly spray the room for us. When we returned later, they had sprayed the room and plugged in a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcVAPE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 insect repellent, which did the trick. I had read on a previous review that breakfast was taken at the sister hotel but while we were there (beginning of March) the buffet was set out on the ground floor of the Anastasia. Cereals, juices, yogurts, croissants, cake, bread, preserves, fresh fruit, ham and cheese along with hot drinks from a machine were available. The breakfast suited us just fine. There was free wifi internet access \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we just got a code from the main reception, which was good for 24 hours on a log on/log off basis. My husband did comment that it was a very good, fast service. This was our fifth stay in Venice but our first at this hotel. We got a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcspecial offer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rate when we booked direct with the hotel so we were delighted that everything was so lovely as well as a good price!

I wanted to be in a good location so chose the San Marco area (not thinking I'd be jet lagged and not care where I was for the one night stay!). We took the ATVO bus from the airport to P. Roma for 5euro, then the number 2 vaparetto (fewer stops than the number 1) to San Marco. The hotel's site has a map to print out, but I also wrote down other directions I'd found which were helpful - after getting off the vaparetto, turn left and go over the foot bridge. Take the first right onto calle Vallaresso (Harrys bar will be on your right when you turn), walk straight to the end of the street, turn left and come to a square with the San Moise church on your left. Walk straight over the footbridge and immediately turn left to walk under the portico for the Lisbona Hotel. You'll immediately see signs for the hotel. The rooms were nice and had flat screen tvs. The bathroom was big and had bath gel and soap but no shampoo. Free breakfast was offered at the hotel next door and it offered cereal, yogurt, fruit, breads, meats, coffee, and juices. They also have wifi, but the only thing to note - we asked the first guy at the desk if the hotel had free wifi. He acted like he was pained to do us a huge favor and would give us one hour for free. If you don't log off, the time expires so, in the morning, we had to ask for another password. The man in the morning was super friendly and gave us another password - good for 20hours!

When I looked around at other hotels in Venice, Hotel Anastasia came up as one of the best values. Breakfast is served in the morning, but I chose to traipse around to the local cafes instead. The only thing to be aware of is that the hotel is a little hard to find because it's around the corner from the main street but a local person in the vicinity was able to point me in the right direction.

It is an unusually low priced place in the best location, minutes from San Marco and the water bus stop. The room I had was a tad small, so I can't talk about the other accomodations. It was comfortable and modestly and tastefully decorated and wasn't burdened with the Venice-kitsch \"elegance\" so many hotels there go overboard on. It had all the things I needed: elevator, plenty of hot water, aircon, mini bar, and a safe. The room and hotel were neat and clean. Yes, you can hear the gondoliers and tradespeople in the morning --- it's Venice, get over it. You don't hear cars and truck and horns as in any other city. The staff was minimal - just a desk person and a few cleaners. I compliment the desk people on their friendliness and attentiveness. When there was a problem with my reservation, they emailed me immediately, kept it open until I called, and we it immediately over the phone. The breakfast, since so many people seem so unnaturally interested in hotel breakfasts, is just a continental breakfast. I think people should be more concerned with whether the TV remote control is in working order. Mine was worn out - it seems to be the case in many hotels. But that's my only complaint about the Anastasia. A word about Venice: it's smaller than one would think and pretty easy to walk most places. There is virtually no nightlife. Lido has a big, popular beach and it's about 15 minute water bus ride from Venice plus about 10 minutes' walk to the beachside. The water at Lido isn't that clean, however.", "Date": "June 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hereford, UK", "Title": "\u201cLovely small hotel close to the centre\u201d", "Author": "sol644", "ReviewID": "UR32511354", "Content": "We arrived at 23.00 to find the streets flooded!!

The hotel is very very centrally located, when every you need to go to toilet, or need to leave you shopping bags, you can directly come to your room and keep on your tour again :)) The hotel personnel can speak English, and they are very helpful. Rooms are not the biggest I have ever seen but are far better than Parisian rooms. Bathroom is all marble, quite new and large. The hotel building is in a small court, even though the are is very central, location is very silent. The breakfast consists of two kind of cheese, honey, marmalade, croissant, bread, cornflakes, tea, coffee, milk and orange juice, which is better than what most of the hotels offer. Mini bar is also okey, they even have mosquito tablettes in the room :) Most of the hotels do not have elevator in Venice (because they are converted from residences / houses of local people), but Hotel Anastasia does. The hotel is suitable for old people, young couples, couples with children and disables visitors. For me, the most important thing was; our room was directly looking to the court infront of the hotel, therefore we had the chance of direct sunlight and view, most of the hotel rooms in Venice are looking to narrow dark streets and some of them even do not have windows so it is better if you include your request in you reservation. Another hint is; ok cannal view is very nice and romantic, but cannals are extremely noisy.", "Date": "June 10, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Anastasia Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d285090-Reviews-Anastasia_Hotel-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$139 - $264*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">San Marco, 2141</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">30124</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Venice</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "285090", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/5f/55/5f5563409810b897f3a2e0dbe318581e1large.jpg"}}
