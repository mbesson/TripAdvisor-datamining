{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Comfortable but so way out! My sister and I just came back, 10/13-10/15.This hotel is NOT 20km, (11 miles) from the airport as stated. Nobody including the ticket person at the airport train station could tell us how to get there. We ended up taking a cab, that even with his GPS could not find the hotel, and had to stop to ask directions twice. The ride turned into a 1 hour ride, costing us EUR 40, app US 60. We eventually found out that there is a bus (Autocorb) (Euro 2.05) from the hotel that can take you to the city centre Maria Cristina station, give yourself at least 45 mins where you hop the train (L3) (Euro 1.25) to Placa Catalunya to catch the Aeroporto Bus (Euro 3.90),( 45 minutes to the airport) and vice-versa. If we had only known that before we shelled out our Euro 40, which was actually 40.50, and refused to pay anymore over to the cab driver, so he cursed us americanos over 0.50. The last bus from the City Centre back to the hotel leaves at 10:00 or 11:00, depending on the day/weekend, so plan accordingly, if you plan to go out and hang out later as the hotel is located in the hills, very steep ride, and other rides are limited, and the cabs will bleed you dry. The staff was friendly, giving us maps and directions for the bus into the city. The continental breakfast left much to be desired for Euro 6.00. The rooms/bathrooms were clean and comfortable if you're just looking for a place to rest. It's really out of the way up in the hills, and that's why I probably wouldn't stay there again, and transportation is iffy. The view from the room terrace is beautiful at nights and early mornings.", "Date": "Oct 17, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR540867813", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "anjifla"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d260637-r10090563-Can_Fisa-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "HotelID": "260637", "Price": "$82"}}
