We found everything to be very charming and the hotel has a lot of character. Several of the reviews on here question the value of money, or the location, but one must remember this is Amsterdam, a city where there are very few hotel rooms of quality. I found that this property affords a guest a unique opportunity to experience Amsterdam. We stayed here using our Priority Club points. Definitely a very strong value per point here as the rates were high during our stay. What really impressed me most was the fact that the hotel honored my elite status at Intercontinental, even on an award night. IHG hotels usually don't honor the status on these point redemptions and stick you in a standard room with no view. We were upgraded to a nice junior suite on the south end of the property. Further we were given the option of late check-out as well as fruit and water. Very nice to see a property provide these benefits for their frequent guests, even if I wasn't paying cash for this particular night - it shows something about the hotel management and definitely makes me feel more comfortable about returning. The rooms at this hotel are simply elegant and classic. They are decorated in a classic style, with very high ceilings, a nice king bed, separate sitting area, and a nice entertainment system. The minibar prices are a bit crazy, but the room service seemed actually only a little bit overpriced and one can take advantage of this for a special occasion. The bathroom was equally large, and had a separate toilet and shower, with a very large bathtub. There were l'Occitane amenities throughout and plenty of towels. The facilities for this hotel were another plus - something that you often don't find with urban hotels in Europe. First, there was a pool, something that once again, you can't really find in Amsterdam. The pool area was like a sort of club lounge, with coffee, fruits, and small snacks there for the guests. The pool was small, but it was welcome, especially considering the setting. The fitness area was small and cramped, but I rarely have seen anything better in terms of a fitness facility and I spend over 100 nights in hotels annually. The service at the property was efficient and welcoming. Whenever I had a request of an employee, it was promptly granted, and they always did so in a welcoming manner. I really appreciated the formal approach of the staff, while at the same time not being overly pretentious. The location has been written down as a negative aspect by several posters, and I really have no idea why. As a veteran Amsterdam traveler, with 50 nights alone each year in area hotels, I don't understand why people are more insistent on staying at the main train station than here. The city centre is very crowded, congested, loud, and generally hectic well into the night. Further, those hotel rooms will all be small and overpriced as well. This hotel is actually in a quiet location, something that is unheard of for Amsterdam. The setting on the river is nice, although not the best views in the world. The metro is right there, as is the tram, and it is only a 2 minute ride to Nieuwmarkt and the Red Light District/Chinatown. Definitely don't write off this property because of the location.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Helsinki, Finland", "Title": "\u201cRelaxing Hotel in downtown of Amsterdam\u201d", "Author": "Mikael7", "ReviewID": "UR125926570", "Content": "Hotel has an excellent staff and the building was very beautiful.

Walking up the stairs to the main entrance you soon realise it is not your average hotel. The doorman welcomed us and took care of the luggage and someone else escorted us to the check in desk, after check in we had a small tour with explenation. We were then escorted to our room which was verything we had expected. Later in the afternoon we got a bit peckish so decided to have some afternoon tea in the beautifully \"lounge\" area situated on the ground floor but with very soothing views of the Amstel and its boats. In the evening we decided to have some dinner in the brasserie and wow what a pleasant surprise. Simple food, very well done. Breakfast was like everything else very well executed.

It is positioned on the river and river view rooms have a very nice view over the Amstel. It will be better when the adjacent bridge construction is complete. But this only intrudes on a small part of the view and we heard no construction noise at all. The hotel is 'Grand' in every sense of the word, high ceilings tall windows and period furnishings. But the technology is all there as well. Wireless access throughout, slow speed free (Good), high speed you pay for (not so good). Flat screen TV, surround sound and DVD player included as well. The bed was extremely comfortable, and the bathroom large with a big bath, separate toilet (this IS Europe), and a walk-in shower. The rooms are also large by European standards. The bar is intimate and friendly with exceptional bar staff, courteous, and seemingly anticipating our every request. The food here is very good, coming from the same kitchen as the main restaurant, but at a significantly lower price. Still not cheap but certainly better value. I found breakfast a puzzle. As others have commented there is a buffet, and no menu. The waiting staff will ask for your beverage choice but if you want anything else then you must ask them. Whatever you request will be freshly cooked to a very high standard (the Eggs Benedict was delicious, with fresh Hollandaise) and served with the usual friendliness. But you DO have to ask, once you are used to this, it is quite liberating to decide what you actually want for Breakfast rather than picking from a list of the usual things. But I'm sure others will find this off-putting. Overall the hotel was a fine haven to come back to after a hard days sight-seeing, we could relax and recharge ready for the next day. Would I stay here again? Absolutely after the convenience, tranquility, and opulence of the Amstel I could not stay anywhere else.

(1) Door staff very friendly. (2) nice Amsterdam View (this is true for most hotels in Amsterdam) (3) Good quality room, maybe not 5 star. A little old fashioned, but nice enough. (4) Has a pool with river views. That's the good bits now for the bad. (1) Breakfast was worst service I have ever experienced apart from perhaps once in a works canteen in Clydach. I stayed with my brother for two nights (he had some deal for one of the nights) and as he paid full price we were under the impression breakfast was included. I would not have returned for breakfast if I'd known we were going to have to pay for it. On both days it was terrible. Why was it bad? Most of the staff bar a young man were rude and gave the impression they were doing you a favour. I was asked \"would I like eggs?\" When I asked if I could have something else I was told \"pancakes.\" It turned out we could have a cooked breakfast but my brother specifically had to ask for this. When on the second day he asked if there was a menu he was told \"no\". This all might sound a little picky but we later found out we were being charged forty euros a head for this on top of having paid full rate for the room. My breakfast on the fist day consisted of two tiny cremated pieces of bacon that broke apart on cutting. For some reason, on the second day, I got four and half slices (so much for consistency). However on the second day I had one egg fried solid and one half raw, go figure. If we wanted something we were made to feel like we were being awkward, for example asking for some more tea. We then had to put up with laughter and the radio being put on full blast intermittently in the kitchen on he first morning. I also overheard one of them moaning my brother had asked for something. For some reason they also thought we might like to listen to the theme from Sesame Street, this was interspersed with loud laughter more akin to a works canteen than a five star hotel. (2) To top it all, when I was thirsty in the night I took a small, cheap, plastic bottle of water out of the mini bar. For this I later found out we would be charged 18 Euros 60. This water can be purchased for 25 cents. (3) when we checked out we made it clear that we thought the breakfast was included as my brother paid full rate. We also told them of the poor service (they were not interested). They knocked off one day's breakfast but we still had to pay for the first day: 80 Euros and the water. Conclusion This was my first experience of staying in a 5 star hotel and I can honestly say I have had better service and felt more comfortable in a Travel Lodge that cost \u00c2\u00a325. A little bit more than the bottle of water. Would I ever stay in this establishment again. As the waiter said when we asked for a menu \"no\".", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oakley, California", "Title": "\u201cTraditional Beauty\u201d", "Author": "hookdontravel", "ReviewID": "UR121697210", "Content": "This very upscale beautifully appointed hotel was perfect for me on the last leg of my African adventure.

The bed was comfortable but the desk not really large enough to work at effectively which was annoying when i had to spend a vast amount of time there working at it. No in-room tea or coffee making facilities meant 20 minutes spent waiting for a cup of overpriced tea. The rest of the room service food that I experienced was similarly very overpriced and not actually particularly nice. The full English breakfast was especially disappointing and tasted even worse than it looked (at 35 euros!).

A problem to be aware of if you have not visited Amsterdam is that there is very little middle ground for hotels. The hotels tend to be either nice but extremely expensive or affordable and not so nice. I thought the Amstel was very nice, but would not recommend it unless you have some kind of promotion or points redemption. I do tend to splurge on nice hotels, but for what this hotel offers, the price per night just seems like a silly waste of money. I stayed because I had an Ambassador certificate for a free night, which made it seem reasonable. Staff at check-in were extremely efficient, friendly, and polite. I was upgraded to a canal view room, which was lovely. The room was comfortable and the bathroom unusually large by European standards. It is true that the location is a bit off the beaten path, and I did have to spend a lot on cabs. But on other days, it was a pleasant walk (20-30 minutes) to get to the shopping/dining areas. That said, the bell service was almost non-existant. Entrance to the hotel is up steps and the bellmen tend to stay inside the lobby and watch guests lug their own bags up the stairs. This is because the bellmen are also serving as assistants to the concierge. The bellmen are actually very friendly in this role, the senior concierge was a bit snobby. The real reason that I wouldn't pay upwards of $500 a night is that the rooms simply aren't that great. The furniture is dated and grandmotherly and the hotel doesn't really offer anything more -- anything else that you need or want is an additional (and high) charge. Based on my experience, this would be a great place to stay for $300/night, but I think they are just riding on their historical reputation and over-charging a lot.

I cannot highly enough recommend this hotel and my family and I will be back to the Amstel. We travel a lot, I have top-tier status with InterContinentals Loyalty Rewards program (RA). My family travels with me generally every other month or so - and I travel weekly. We have stayed at some of the finest hotels in the world. We have very high standards and expect a first class level of service. On this trip I had concerns about my reservation - and I emailed and called the hotel. I recieved a quick response assuring me that everything would be perfect when I arrived. When I further inquired - I recieved a similiar guarantee. So far so good - there was a concern and the hotel handled it perfectly (this was at 10pm on a Saturday night). We arrive - very late (I think it was midnight when we got in from Cologne (where we had stayed at the InterContinental)). The check-in process was flawless in spite of my eariler concern and we very quickly wisked up to our room. From out of the cab to in the room took perhaps 5 minutes in total. I like this - it was late, we were all tired and staff made an effort to get us taken care of quickly in spite of my concern. They had anticipated my needs and exceeded my every expectation. I will always return to a hotel that has proved itself able to solve problems. My wife happened to mention to my son in passing we would look at the room service menu once we got settled in the room; the gentleman checking us into the hotel suddenly produces a menu and assists us with placing our order. Our food arrived within minutes. The room was glorious, stunning views of the river and the city. It was spacious and comfortable. Truly elegant, never over the top - just first class. It is hard to know where to start the foyer was well sized, the living room was comfortable and the master bedroom sumptious, the bath was massive and the shower was powerful and refreshing. Every detail down to the amenities exceeded our every expectation. Someone had even thought to place a third robe in the room for my son along with extra towels, etc... Upon waking the following morning to glorious views we headed downstairs to speak with the concierge. He did not dissapoint. He built a tour for us, got us tickets and sent us on our way with the promise of a great meal arranged when we returned. After a wonderful but tiring day touring the city and museams we returned eager to see what awaited us. Except we managed to collapse in our room...by the time we had showered and changed (and i snuck away for a quick moment in the spa and pool - which were great) - the concerige had gotten us new reservations. The meal was exactly what we asked for, great seafood - showcasing the best the Netherlands has to offer (the resturant was Bridges - amazing recommendation we would never have found as the resturant does not have a star (although if it doesn't get 2 in the next guide I'll be shocked)). Everything was just better, cleaner, neater, easier than expected. The hotel is also physicall beautiful. My son described the hotel as,\"German efficiency with smiles and kindness\". I have to agree with him - everything ran perfectly, even our problems both the ones we knew about the ones the staff avoided by anticipating our needs before we ever thought of them (the extra robe, etc...) were excellent. Is there a catch - yes. You pay for this. The hotel is great value for money if you have the money to spend on a hotel room. My feeling after reading some reviews is that folks were surprised by prices. At a hotel such as this, it's no business hotel with free breakfast, it is a very expensive hotel kept in immaculate shape and staffed by a stunningly professional and polite staff. These things cost money. The hotel is by no means cheap - but if you happy to spend $900 a night on a perfect hotel room (River View Executive Suite) - this is the place for you. We loved everything about the hotel. We loved the mini-bar, the selections were perfect and if you wanted to actually mix a drink they had placed real botttles in the room, not those silly mini-bottles which contain barely enough liquor for a single short pour. The food was great, room service, etc... This hotel was more than the sum of it's parts - after a long vacation touring Europe - the Amstel provided a respite for relaxation with calm tranquilty.

If you want a historic property run by an efficient staff, if an ornamented dormer window, or a majestic double staircase and late sun and river light through the windows spark your imagination of other times and places, you will be well served here. I have never found the staff to be cold at all (as some have written here). This last stay I had a few problems with the room (main one was a lack of hot water from a wayward shower) and was offered a suite next door, since the water problem could not be fixed without outside help. Things break, life is short, if a solution is immediately and kindly offered, what more can you want. I did not eat at La Rive this time, but I was able to once (they do not always have a table for one, understandably) and it was a fine experience. Yes, there is only one restaurant (more like a pub) in the immediate vicinty of the hotel (I believe there are a couple of snack bars towards the tram stop) but I think if you cross the bridge (the one on the right as you leave, not the one under construction) and turn left, there are a few places to eat in that area-- not that far. (There is a supermarket there, too.) There is also a pub just by the highway on your right as you leave (have not been there). There are also a couple of places down the Amstel towards the Hermitage. Just ask the concierge and all will be explained. Room service is efficient and the food is quite good. And if the wireless is down, there are three computers with a printer behind the desk that are available. Coffee machines in the room are helpful to have. There is tea as well and a very fast-to-boil tea-pot. The exercise room is small but very useful. The pool looks like a romantic place to spend an afternoon (I saw a couple doing just that one sunny late afternoon, blissfully ignoring everyone else). People watching when the hotel has an event in one of its public rooms is also fun, as dressed up Amsterdam arrives, coats are checked in the lobby and the ladies sweep across the lobby.

Did not live up to a 5 star hotel, paid 420 Euros/night for 5 nights for an executive river view room on the 4th floor. Room was large, but very dimly lit in all areas, river view was not that impressive. 2 windows overlooking the river, but one was in the bathroom, well actually in the shower stall. Very nice, large bathroom with huge shower and separate tub. Hotel was quiet overall, except whenever anyone walked down the hallway, the sound/vibration of their footsteps disrupted our sleep, especially early in the morning. Many early riser business people and maids up and down the hallway. The head of our bed was against the hallway wall, never seen this in a hotel before. No coffee maker in our room. We were offered 2 glasses of complimentary champagne (by the woman who checked us in) that never came; don't offer anything you can't deliver. I should have known service would be questionable when I emailed the hotel a question before my stay, and never heard back from them. After waiting 14 days for a response, I sent a follow-up email entitled \"2nd request\", then I received a response. Housekeeping was not stellar, we had to complain to housekeeping that our rug had not been vaccuumed in 3 days and one of our trash cans was not emptied after morning maid service. It was cleaned though after turn-down service. I suppose they didn't see that the rug needed vacuuming due to the bad lighting. Rather than using a vacuum to clean up crumbs, housekeeping deemed it more appropriate to cover the crumbs with the floor mat and slippers left during turndown service. This is 5 star service? Hardly. Sometimes our robes were hung up, and other times not. Sometimes our slippers were laid out bedside with turn-down service and sometimes not. Small things, but things that should be mastered by a 5 star hotel. The concierge, his name was Aad, was outstanding. He was a pleasure and always helpful. On our first day we sat down for breakfast and waited a long time before we were approached by staff. We had omelettes that were delicious. We asked for 2 glasses of water which were brought out from the kitchen already poured, so we were very surprised when we were charged 9 Euros for the 2 glasses. It was our first meal in Amsterdam, so we were not aware that most places only have bottled water. Not many restaurants/ cafes close by to grab breakfast, would have preferred a hotel with a more central location, but we opted for the Amstel river view. We didn't feel the hotel was a value for the price we paid. The rooms need some updating too. Permanent furniture indentations in many spots of the rug where furniture previously was, crack in the ceiling over the bed, mismatched paint to cover another repair on the ceiling. Prepaid for a better price 3 months in advance, so don't understand why there is a pending credit card charge for almost $2000 plus another misc amount. All extras that were charged to our room were paid upon check-out. If you really love Van Gogh, go to the Kroeller Muller museum in Otterlo, it's actually better than the Van Gogh museum!

Boy was I disappointed!! It's a really old, small hotel and felt anything but luxurious and opulent to me. Like others have mentioned, I was given an average room with a small window overlooking the residential area. So much for being an Ambassador!! I was appalled to step up to the (small) window and check out what I could see, and find a disgusting display of trash and cigarette butts below the window, obviously from dirty smokers illegally smoking out their windows. Ick. It was positively nasty, and I absolutely can't believe it was like that at a hotel of this caliber. The mini bar was a joke. They don't provide a pricelist, and when I asked about it I was told it was \"management decision\" not to have a price list. Well, I don't care how much money I have or am willing to spend, I should have the right to know what the heck you want to charge me for a soda!! It turns out a Coke Light was $8.50!!!! So glad I asked. I will never pay that anywhere. It's just absurd. The decor was classic Victorian and to me, felt old and tired and anything but luxurious. But I am also one who loves modern and contemporary, so take my critique with that in mind. To me, anytime I see ruffles and floral print I think it looks old and tired, even if it's brand new. The thing I liked most was the giant flat panel TV that swung out from the wall so you could see it from the bed, but the one movie I wanted to watch (that I got for free as an Ambassador) wasn't in English even though it was an American New Release!! Are you kidding me???? Upon leaving, the valet couldn't find my car keys. I waited over 20 minutes without being told what was going on and was even rudely made to move from where I was standing so that the one doorman/valet could move bicycles out for a family, while I had called for my car at least 30 minutes prior and proceeded to check out and then wait while all this was going on. It was just lame. And all the guy had to say was \"it's just not my day\". Well, sorry, but that's not good enough at a place of such high acclaim!! I will never go back here in a million years.

The room was serviced every morning during breakfast. However the service has deteriorated (we stayed here four years ago). Breakfast was very poor because the staff lacked experienced. On two of the four morning they did not manage to serve the eggs we had ordered, we were not offered toast, and getting coffee, milk and butter was a bit of a battle every day. There were very few guests, but we still had to wait because tables had not been re-set. The buffet was good, and of course the setting is excellent. We saw most of the breakfast staff under taking other roles in the hotel during the day (i.e. bell boy) and so it is reasonable to assume that the use of untrained staff was the cause of the problem. It is also fair to point out that the staff tried very hard to please, they just gave us the impression that they had not served in a restaurant before. The minibar was not re-stocked during our stay, and room service could not provide a price list for the mini bar. For much of the day the concierge desk was staffed by a bell boy, who could do little more than give out leaflets. The hotel was very quiet, as is Amsterdam at the moment, and the service may be better when demand picks up in the summer. This may be a temporary problem before summer staff are hired. On the other hand the rooms were not offered at a discount rate so we should not expect the hotel to be run on a skeleton staff. On the whole I would therefore give this hotel a miss until the there are some reports that the service problems have been solved.

I had been staying in the Grand Hotel Stockholm a few weeks before visiting the Amstel and although I found the Grand Hotel Stockholm to be impressive the Amstel was in a class of its own. The room was spacious, comfortable beds, amazing mini-bar (large bottles of spirits). The bathroom had a decent sized bath and our room had a separate shower. I missed breakfast both times after too late a night out, but the service in the restaurant in the evening was superb. It's very pricey, but worth what you get, and thanks to using points to book the hotel it gave us plenty of money to enjoy the restaurant. It's located on the river, with excellent views. The only problem with this hotel is the price is normally out of my price range and I don't like using points every time I stay at a particular hotel, I like to reward the best hotels. I'll look out for deals the next time I stay. I've stayed in some nice hotels in Amsterdam, The Grand Sofitel used to be a favourite before trying the Amstel.

This could partly be that I have become more spolt over the years but I did find the service a bit lack-lustre this trip, as if the hotel staff have lost their spark. There was little evidence of proactive service and quite often there wasn't a waiter around when you wanted one! I did wonder whether this was - at least in part - a result of the current economy: i.e. fewer customers, maybe fewer staff ? Check-in was fine, but rather cold and formulaic - there was simply no real engagement with us as human beings. The hotel itself is still grand and generally well-maintained, though I noticed that the red carpet on the steps leading up to the hotel entrance is looking rather scruffy. Also, we did find the lighting in the lifts was ridiculously low. I know these are old lifts harking back to a bygone (pre-electricity) era, but the lighting level was equivalent to a couple of candles - you could only see the lift buttons when the doors opened! We had a Junior Suite, which was a good size and the bathroom was excellent: large shower plus bath, separate room for the tolilet. Very good linens and a comfy bed. The swimming pool is immaculately kept and very clean. Breakfast at La Rive - mixed. Service was patchy and the breakfast was OK, but nothing great.

The food in the Lounge and Brasserie has improved recently and the terrace on the river has been restyled. The spa area is not large but the fitness (new equipment), pool and sauna are very elegant and relaxing. The service in the Lounge, Brasserie and at La Rive for breakfast has become poor. Waiting time for dishes is far too long. Breakfast, rarely a strong point in Dutch hotels, has declined sharply (and is now poor value for money at 25 - 40 euro): no more delicious home-made jams, poorer quality breads, average pastries, more limited buffet selection, etc. This is particularly surprising, given the quality of Edwin Cats' cuisine at La Rive.

After waiting about 30 minutes, they found another room that smelled better but also backed onto the elevator shaft. When I asked about that, the young woman said \"There's nothing else available\" and walked away. The much-vaunted service vanished. Apparently, if you pay Intercontinental an Internet rate, you get worse than usual treatment and only a choice of the worst rooms in the hotel.

This place isn't for everyone but for those like myself -who come to amsterdam to visit the museums and aren't interested in the tourist centers or the red light district- then it is the perfect place being about a 20 minute walk (through a neighborhood where the contemporary art galleries are located) to the vangogh museum. I must STRESS that a large room with a river view is definitely a MUST! I actually had such a beautiful view that we could see the Rjiks museum and the amstel river from the bed! The bathrooms are really among my favorite with large tubs that fill in 2minutes with separate class showers featuring amazing showerheads and really great water pressure. The bathrooms compete with those of the ritz (another favorite), but dont have all the marble, it's amsterdam so it's a different kind of elegance. The fourth floor(top) seems the best with the largest rooms but the third was great too and actually had better views because you are just high-enough from the river. The pool and gym are too small but are beautiful and on a hot summer day are very busy. The riverside sun deck could definitely use many more lounge chairs and poolside service personel is lacking. Overall though this is an excellent boutique hotel that is just small enough to make you feel like you are staying at a private club or rich relative's mansion. The restaurant was fantastical and it has a view that matches the food. The tasting menu with wine was a bargain and very well executed. The staff are so pleasant and warm and really make the food seem special. Room service was really well done and I had no problem with anything other then the pool and river deck. It is a small personable hotel far from the maddening crowds but closer to the museums and zoo. If you are an art lover then I also highly recommend having the museum reserve a car to take you to the Kroller Moller.", "Date": "July 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cIt doesn't get bettert than this!\u201d", "Author": "TravelerAnonymous", "ReviewID": "UR5018356", "Content": "I am a seasoned traveler and thoroughly investigate hotels and restaurants before I go.

My main beef is with the parent company Inter Continental Hotels. I booked the hotel only the day before arrival and was told that the only room left was an Executive King with River View at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac375 per night. We booked for 5 nights. It did seem expensive but judging from the reviews on this site I thought it would be worth it. Upon arrival we were put into a Square Facing room (not river) and told this was all that was available with no explanation or apology. With exception of the view the room was fine, although upon closer inspection the CD player was not working which was replaced the following day. Also, the speakers in the bathroom were only connected to the TV and not the CD player?!? Why they set it up in this manner is beyond me. This along with the fact the TV was at least 10 years old and the in house films were fed through on VHS (bad quality) and only 2 english channels is definitely not what I would expect from 'one of the best hotels' in the Netherlands. The minibar prices were a joke - \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.00 for a mars bar! The setting of the hotel is very grand but seeming very dated now, and the staff have the air about them that you should be grateful to be there. I have stayed in many fantastic hotels in the world - this may have been one once but certainly isn't now. The hotel is fairly close to the city centre although it is a walk of 15-20 mins. Upon checking out I was told that for 2 of the nights the rate had risen to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac440.00 per night - I complained this was not what was quoted and they said that I should take it up with central reservations - again without any apology or sign of empathy for the customer.

The Bar next to the La Rive restaurant isn't as expensive as I expected for the class of hotel for drinks - though 95 euros for Hine, althought I had a free taste, was stretching it a bit.
