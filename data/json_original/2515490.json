It's only about a 15-minute walk. I feel like the building must have one time been a retirement or assisted living center because the rooms were designed in that way. The rooms are very small with only a \"full\" size bed, which was slightly larger than a twin. The bathroom, equally tiny, has the toilet and shower and the sink is on a counter next to the bed. I found that strange, but whatever. The room was clean, which was a huge plus. Also, the addition of a fridge and microwave in the room was a nice touch. But there were other little things that were flawed. For one, there were a few outlets int he room, but they were stretched out so that my plugs wouldn't stay in them and fell right out onto the floor. Also, the room was very stuffy and had an old-school window air conditioner. The window did open, but when closed it provided very little sound proofing from the street. In fact, I was woken up through the closed window, through the sound of the AC, and through my ear plugs by a group of raucous college-age kids around 7:30am in another room across the alley from my room. Two reasons I selected this hotel was because of the free breakfast and the free transportation to and from the airport. The breakfast was standard and decent for a hotel breakfast (assuming you're OK with food-like substances that are made to look like eggs, sausage, waffles, and high-fructose corn syrup syrup). The transportation not so much. No where on the website or in communications with the hotel did it mention that you have to take a shuttle van to the hotel. Taking the shuttle van was fine, but it was very confusing upon arriving about what I was supposed to do and where I was supposed to wait for a shuttle and which shuttle. When I asked about the shuttle back to the airport, I was told by two different people at the front desk that they no longer provide transportation back to the airport but they could call me a cab or make a reservation for a shuttle for me. I told them both that the website said otherwise, but they insisted. So I just ordered my own shuttle and it was fine. But then, as I was waiting for my shuttle to arrive, the front desk manager was telling someone else that they have a voucher for a taxi included with the hotel! I asked him about it and he said that they indeed provided transportation to the airport. When I told him he might want to retrain the front desk staff since two of them at different times told me otherwise, he acted like it was my fault! Overall, if you're only one person traveling and won't be there very long (and won't be spending a lot of time in the room), this is an OK place to stay. But be prepared to get yourself back to the airport depending on who is working the front desk.", "Date": "February 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winston Salem, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cSmall, clean, cheap good location.

It is 10 minutes from the airport. They do not have their own shuttle. Shuttle service is coordinated through Super Shuttle and/or taxis which are paid for by the property. This is a Choice Hotels property, so I didn\u2019t expect much. I stayed in room 409 which is a standard King. The room is small but well kept. From an entertainment prospective, it seemed fine. Good location near many restaurants and bars. Only two short blocks to Fifth Street. The room had it\u2019s own, window mounted A/C unit which was noisy, as was the overhead fan which hummed constantly. I shut both of them off during my stay. There was moderate street noise in the room, with an occasional police or fire truck going by. Typical large city noises. The room has a micro/fridge combo with coffee maker and small sink in the sleeping area. The bathroom is the size of a Chicklet , but was clean. It has a 32\u201d flat screen TV. If you\u2019re here for work, like me, this room falls short. The work desk is small and has a horrible chair. There is only ONE outlet for use with laptops, etc. The bed was good but the pillows were cheap and lumpy. The staff was cordial, but not overly friendly. Parking was $16.00 for a surface lot behind the hotel which is not monitored. Overall I would give the property a 78/100 and 90/100 for value. I would consider staying again, but would also see what else was available nearby.

Being on a budget, the huge hotels were out of my price range. To make a long story short, the Comfort Inn Gaslamp was an excellent choice. Free HOT breakfast including eggs and make-your-own waffles...plus coffee with lids to take with you saved a ton on Starbucks at the convention center. The location, while all of Gaslamp is absolutely filthy and disgusting, is pretty good. It's a quick walk to the convention center just a few short blocks away. You are one block off of 5th (the main drag), so it is fairly quiet. There are some pretty good retaurants not on 5th that are just a block down and over from here (Smashburger being one)...and they are less expensive. There is a handy CVS just a one block away, and since the rooms have refrigerators and microwaves, it is nice to be able to pick up a two liter and some grub and keep it cold in the room. Grab some bottles of water or soda to take with you to the convention center, they are $4 there. Location gets a A. Yes, the rooms are small, but not short on amenities. Other than sleeping, how much time do you really spend in the room? There is a desk if you need one, big luggage area, a chair, and the bed. A flat screen TV hangs on the wall. The sink is in the room right next to the bed, but you get used to that quickly. No biggie. Bed and pillows are very comfortable and VERY clean (no BB, I checked). Staff was freindly and helpful. The hotel also has free wifi, while slow and weak in my room, it worked enough to get e-mails done. Just don't expect to stream anything. With all the smartphones and tablets around now, I suspect the router gets hammered with bandwidth on a nightly basis, though, so I'll give them a pass on this.

The manager eventually got it and I was checked in. This was slightly frustrating since we were running a little late in getting into San Diego due to lots of traffic. Anyway, the room was fine. The layout is a bit weird with the sink right next to one of the beds (not in the same space as shower) but workable. Room was clean. Beds in all the Comfort Inns are very hard. Nice flat screen tv in the room. Parking right around back. Breakfast is decent and room is spacious where you eat it. The only problem was our room was facing the street and we heard alot of traffic noise and people walking the streets. We had the A/C on which muffled some of the sound, but request room NOT facing the street for more quiet. The location is perfect for going to the Gas Lamp quarter which is loaded with great restaurants and bars. We where there on a Saturday night which was extremely busy night. We were not allowed in some of the restaurants because my son was not over 21. I think this place is great but maybe not with young kids especially at night. Lots of young college people here who are definitely out to party.

We were more than pleasantly surprised by the Comfort Inn Gaslamp mainly for the following: 1) The rooms were small but extremely comfortable and very very clean; 2) The bed was a double so not very spacious but very condusive to sleep, it was in the medium to firm range, just perfect after a day of exploring the city. There were nice pillows and again the key factor was clean; 3) The hotel staff were very service oriented and past reviews seemed flawed in this area. The front desk staff were courteous, the room staff were efficient and you get more in service than what you pay for at this hotel, another plus; 4) The location is ideal, you are a few short steps away from the Horton Plaza (best shopping in the area), you are about three blocks from party and eating central (5th avenue) and you are out of the way enough to get a good quiet night's rest. 5) The breakfast - This was the only factor that did not have this hotel earning the best review. The breakfast was one of the poorest we have ever experienced (we are avid world travellers). It was too processed, too cheaply prepared and even a budget hotel can do better than what was presented here. the seating was as inadequate as the food and we feel that this is where Comfort Inn can improve on the most. Out of ten, we rate this breakfast at best a one! Thankfully, this food experience was not a reflection of San Diego's cuisine and guests will find great foods everwhere else.

Their breakfast has fruit, eggs, potatoes and an assortment of cereals. It is a great way to enjoy a big meal and a light lunch, then have a KILLER dinner! * Rooms. You are downtown and your nightly rate is affordable and so the rooms size will coincide, they're not huge. This is not a party hotel, it is perfect for two friends, a couple or a solo person. If you have more than one with you try to get a corner room- they have the best views anyways.

I could sit on the edge of the bed and use the sink (only a shower/tub and toilet in the bathroom), microwave, and refrigerator. The bed was just the right firmness and I fell asleep quickly and had a restful night's sleep. The hotel and neighborhood around it was quiet; no loud noises even though it was on a busy street. The view out my window was of a wall a few feet away. There were bars, restaurants, stores, and San Diego bay attractions within easy walking distance. The room was exactly what I needed for four days at a business meeting/conference. I was hardly in my room except for sleeping.

I booked a last minute room at the Comfort Inn in Gaslamp expecting the same quality of other Comfort Inns I've stayed at, truth be told, I was sadly mistaken. When I made the reservations, they had mentioned that airport transportation was free, do not believe them, it is free from the airport not to the airport. I was forced to take a taxi that took $15.00 to get to the airport in the morning. Aside from that flagrant lie, it is not the only thing that went wrong. Upon entering the hotel, the lobby looked okay, there was a fish tank with a huge puffer fish in it which was kind of neat, little did I know upon checking out that I would feel horrible for the fish that have to inhabit that hotel. After checking in I proceeded to my room located on the 4th floor by taking the elevator which you swear was going to break down at any given time it was so slow. Upon arriving at my floor and walking down the hallway to my room, I had a lingering suspicion that I was walking straight into a dump. I got to my room and the first thing I noticed after opening the door was an unbearable odor of what seemed to be fecal matter. I could not locate the source of the stench but it seemed to emanate from the carpet. Wherever it came from, it was strong enough to keep me up all night feeling ill. The second thing I noticed was the window that had a air conditioner sticking out of it and upon further inspection, a large gap in between the wall and the window which the gap was large enough to let bugs in. The room was extremely small, very dissapointing as I've stayed at a nicer, larger hotel room for the same price in the past. The bed was tiny, taking up most of the room, the little room you had left to walk was cut short by the sink situated 1 foot or so from the bed, very strange as I've never seen a sink in the bed area, you'd think it would be located in the bathroom? As for the sleeping situation, I slept with my jeans, shirt and socks... Usually I sleep more casual in a hotel but I feared the worst and during the little sleep I did get, I was violently awoken by a horrible itching sensation, I have had fears that I had contact with bedbugs in this room yet nothing has been confirmed.

Third-party prices fill rooms, and provide the business with opportunities to sell services and win future customers. My advice post-purchase: pay attention to reviews, articulate needs clearly (both in advance and on arrival) and speak directly and immediately to management if your expectations are not met. If basic room needs are unmet, ask management for adjustment; if unresponsive, tell the 3rd-party vendor in writing; use snail mail to the company\u2019s street address and direct to Customer Service VP. I\u2019ve found both Hotwire and Priceline highly responsive. Talk to management directly and pleasantly: they value meaningful guest feedback and often can use information you provide to correct persistent problems. Whatever rate you paid, be courteous and civil to a fault: it never helps to be confrontational. Commend with care what is commendable.] Hotels can be tough and expensive in San Diego, even on Priceline; I paid $70. This is a compact, centrally-located hotel with 103 rooms in the Gaslamp District of downtown San Diego. It\u2019s locally owned, and Comfort-Choice branded. It\u2019s a modest walk to bus routes and the trolley, not far from the stadium or Civic Center performance venues. It\u2019s a quick cab ride from Amtrak\u2019s Union Station, and not far from the water.

Rooms have a tiny footprint, not unlike a New York hotel room; but are beautifully designed with obvious careful attention to guest comfort. Every room has a refrigerator and microwave and coffee maker. The vanity and kitchen counter are next to the bed; tub and toilet separate with a sliding door closure to the bathroom. Working window AC, baseboard heating unit. Hot and cold water spigots were reversed and unmarked, an odd but small problem that was cheerfully fixed within minutes of my reporting it. ONE THING I\u2019D FIX: Heat is supplied by a baseboard until, and the controls are awkward to find and locate; it\u2019s slow to respond. Small signage atop the unit would take care of this. AND: Ask to be placed away from large groups of young people. I wasn\u2019t bothered but saw potential for hallway noise based on the youth and exuberance of other guests.

I read lots of hotel reviews before booking and decided I liked the sound of the Comfort Inn. Some reviews weren't entirely positive, but I noticed that the negative comments were usually about the position of the sink or the size of the room, or other things that weren't important to me. So I went ahead and booked. I was very glad I made the decision to stay at the Comfort Inn. The staff were friendly, the room was a good size, and it was very clean. It was great to have access to the business center and the laundry facilities (clean clothes are so much easier to pack when going back home). And the breakfast that other reviewers have praised definitely lived up to expectations. Coming from the UK and therefore jet-lagged, I woke up every morning ravenously hungry, and it was really great to be able to go downstairs and wolf down bacon and sausages. The water and popcorn in the room was a nice touch. And also the fridge and microwave. As a Brit, I like to drink tea, ideally made with scalding water and a splash of milk, and that's hard to accomplish in the US where electric kettles don't seem to exist. But of course with a microwave it's possible to get the water hot enough. (I bought some really good tea leaves across the road too.) I also liked the location of the hotel. It was a quick and easy walk to the convention center; there was a small store around the corner where I could get bits and pieces; and a larger grocery store just a couple of blocks away. There were also plenty of good restaurants nearby. The area felt very safe: as a single woman I had no anxieties about walking around late at night. I had a great time and I would definitely recommend the Comfort Inn to anyone looking for a hotel in the Gaslamp area of San Diego.", "Date": "December 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value\u201d", "Author": "omotors", "ReviewID": "UR22043540", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel for two nights while attending a function at the Westin.

Someone was singing upstairs in a room near us?!? The hungover gals at breakfast were funny in their pjs and sunglasses.

You may notice that you pay a little more than you usually might for a Comfort Inn, but the location makes that extra price a good deal.

If you are part of the jet set, look elsewhere. For everyone else, it's very easy to adapt to the room layout, including the full cable TV and A/C.

I have been familiar with the Comfort Inn brand and the rooms can be small and just a step above motel standard setup, but the rooms here are very tiny. That being said, however, the rooms at Comfort Inn Gaslamp are very efficiently put together and just the right size for a couple who does not mind close quarters or have a lot of luggage. There is more than meets the I in these rooms. There was a mini-fridge, coffee maker, microwave, full size ironing board and steam iron (you just do not know how rare it can be to get a steam iron in a hotel sometimes), good water pressure in the shower, and plenty of drawers and lighting. Plus the little extras, like the cute courtyard with the mini-fountains, the beautifully decorated lounge area with the tropical fish tank, adequate business center and complimentary continental breakfast (with the famous Comfort Inn Waffles of course) make this hotel feel much more than just an older urban lodge. Not to mention the location! The Padres were playing and parking was expensive at a lot down the street ($14/night), but the desk tipped us to park early before the spaces fill up for the game that evening. We left our car there and walked around the area. There are some of the best restaurants in California just 1-2 blocks away and great shopping at several local stores and the downtown mall (fresh air mall of course in CA.) The nightlife is not to be missed if you are under 35 (in real age or in spirit.) It will take you back to those good ol college days for sure! It can get chilly in the evening, so be sure to bring a light sweater or wind-breaker type of jacket. We visited in the middle of June and it was hot during the day.
