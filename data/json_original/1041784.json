We went there for a long weekend in Agust. We have choosen this hotel beacuse of the swimingpool, which was really nice !! However, as you can read on the lifelet in the room, swimingpool is open only for the very end of June till the end of Agust. The bad thing was a room ( nothing like in the pictures on the website ), and a luck of AC / fan in the room. In Agust temperatures are realy high, even in the mountains and you are not able to sleep. After a night, and second complain we were moved to another room, which was one of the new with AC and very nice, clean room. Other than that the breakfast which is included, was quite nice nothing special but OK. This hotel is very popular among older people so be prepared to see them sleeping everywhere in the hotel, and fiting from the earlie hours for a space around swimingpool ( which they don't use later for a most of the day - just having their towels lying on the bed).", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cirencester, England", "Title": "\u201cGreat stopover\u201d", "Author": "PeterBeard", "ReviewID": "UR21123361", "Content": "This is conveniently located just north of Madrid, ideal for Segovia and Pedraza without paying top tourist rates.

The hotel is 10-15 mins walk to the centre of the village. There is an outside pool with beautiful views to the mountains, a games room and a restaurant listed in the Michelin guide. Our room was spacious and spotlessly clean. There is no air conditioning, but a portable tower fan which was fine (very quiet and powerful). The staff at the hotel were extremely pleasant and helpful and the manager gave us a really good rate \u2013 90 euros per night for a quad room. Breakfast was traditional continental \u2013 pastries, juice, fruit, meats, yoghurt plus tea and coffee. The food in the restaurant itself was delicious, although be warned \u2013 the restaurant staff speak NO English! When we were there (early July), we had the pool virtually entirely to ourselves, apart from one weekend when the hotel was pretty busy. Easy-listening music is played out to the pool area. The hotel room had a balcony with a couple of chairs, and blinds behind the curtains to keep the room dark at night. There was a hairdryer in the bathroom (not wonderful but ok), desk and chair, TV. The hotel has a large TV room with comfy chairs and a big screen. It has a website I think, there isn\u2019t a lot more I can say except that it has a lovely location, and is clean, relaxing and friendly. I would definitely recommend the hotel if you are staying in Becerril.", "Date": "July 23, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Las Gacelas", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d1041784-Reviews-Hotel_Las_Gacelas-Madrid.html", "Price": "$63 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Paseo de San Sebastian, 53</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28490</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1041784", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/fc/9f/fc9fd1a6f73ecca68858f23bc3dba39a87large.jpg"}}
