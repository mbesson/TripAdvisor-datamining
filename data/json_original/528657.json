Not good for a female thats for sure! No lifts so we had to carry our suitcases up about 4 flights of narrow stairs. Breakfast was nice but again the man doing the cooking was rather rude. This was not the same man as in reception so it tells you something about their staff. We travelled to Windsor for a few days and asked before booking if we could leave some luggage at the hotel as we intended to stay for a few more days on our return. This was confirmed as fine however the same cook (I assume was the manager) argued about this with the same staff member. It was a rediculous scene.

Hotel puts you in walking distance to Kensington area, but better yet, at just two minutes to Paddington, buy a week's unlimited Zone 1 transit pass and you'll find nearly everything you want to see just a short bus or tube ride away.
