You can hear the sound of the London underground as the train pass closeby, l know this issue was raised by previous guests and also the size of the small televisions in the room, but l dont go away to sit in a room all day and night to watch TV and listen to the underground. Breakfast was my sticking point, this is where the hotel failed it wasn't a full English, there were only mushrooms, bacon and powdered scrabbled eggs, If you enjoy continental breakfast then its fine, although some of the products used weren't of the best quality, in particular the cereals. The cereal dispensing area was very untidy. Tea and coffee is self service from a vending type machine, pots of tea and coffee served to the table would be a far better idea. We had to wait a few minutes for a table to be prepared as the breakfast room was busy at 0900. To give credit, l submitted the satisfaction survey to the hotel on departure, highlighting these points and the manager responded withing 24 hours by e-mail This was part of his reponse to the breakfast and the air conditioning. Regarding your comments about the breakfast I would like to point out that the breakfast that all bookings include (as advertised also in the website Booking.com) is a buffet breakfast (not an English breakfast) that is the reason why there is only few hot products in the selection offer. Nevertheless we offer our guests the possibility to have a full English breakfast at an additional cost of \u00a33. The air conditioning units have been recently installed and unfortunately they are not running 100% yet as there are some faults in the system that we are trying to fix at the moment.

We booked far enough in advance that we had a wonderful daily rate, which included the breakfast which was well appointed, and saves 20 pounds per day. Lots of fresh fruit, breads, yogurt, cold meats, cheeses, and the traditional British eggs, sausage and beans. Great way to start the day. The hotel also has a pool, and a sauna - nothing lavish, but a great way to get rid of a 10 hour flight. Our room was tiny - but the shower worked great, with loads of hot water - this is a must for that town. There is a lot of construction in that area, but our room was quiet. So - pool, hot water, breakfast, two star price - two thumbs up. The location of the hotel is wonderful - 3 blocks from the Queensway tube station - about 5 blocks from Paddington. Every morning we could be on the Central line at Queensway in 7-8 minutes. Eateries are also wonderful in the area, Italian, Med, Thai - multiple pubs to and from. Lots of places for currency exchange which at a better exchange rate than at the airport, or at the stations. So we have to give it a big two thumbs up for the location alone. Now we come to the condition of the hotel - it is old and the carpet should be replaced - the floors creak, if you use a white glove - it will come away dirty - not filthy, but dusty. The staff is mostly helpful, but I have had worse at hotels that I paid $600 per night. It just depends on what you are going to use the hotel for, a base camp for exploring London, or a place that you will spend most of your time. If you need a place to drop your stuff, recharge and be centrally located - I would recommend this place and we will stay there again.

Our room smelt appallingly of stale cigarette smoke, and was very small - not at all like the rooms in the pictures. I complained, but was told that all rooms are non-smoking, and so there couldn't be any smell. The room was also scruffy, more like a hostel than a four-star hotel. The carpet was so filthy that we initially thought we had black mould - in fact, we only had black mould on the window. Rubbish had piled up outside said window and was actually leaning on the glass, so we had to keep the curtains closed. The headboard was broken, as was the mirror in the bathroom. What really annoyed my partner, though, was the lack of biscuits with the tea making facilities. Breakfast was truly, inspiringly awful. The eggs were powdered, the mushrooms tinned, the sausages of unidentifiable origin. On the other hand, the fresh fruit was nice. This was a relief, after the appalling experience of drinking the acid-like fruit juice. This, after smelling cigarette smoke all night and listening to people in the next room and in the corridor outside, was simply too much, and I complained. I was told that I couldn't complain, because there was no manager there that day, but the \"trainee\" (I kid you not) who was left on his own from when we checked in at 5pm to when we left at 10am, would pass my comments on.

We didn't come to London to look at the hotel, so that didn't bother us at all. As we arrived early, check in was not possible, but they have a safe luggage room and we came back to check in later. We were first given a room on the first floor facing the street. But since this room lacked sheets and smelled strongly of paint, we quickly returned to the front desk and were given a new room on the ground floor. The first room was apparently still undergoing refurbishment. The staff were helpful and serviceminded about changing rooms however. When we found the room, it was small. London is famous for small rooms, so a good tip is to book a tripple room if you are more than two peolpe traveling. They always seem to be a lot larger than the normal double rooms. The room was clean enough, had a small and ancient TV (I am not in London to watch the telly, so don't mind that), it also has water boiler and complimentary coffee and tea. There is also an ironing board and a small safe box hidden away. Obviously they are trying to have all the amenities of a four star. On a positive side, the room did have free wifi access. The hotel is a bit more pricy than the hotels I usually stay in when in London. But it does have a couple of features that try to make up for the higher price. The first thing is the small swimming pool and sauna. Really relaxing and well worth an extra 5-10 pound a night. The other thing is a decent breakfast. When I have stayed in other nearby hotels, I have always had breakfast at one of the local pubs, cause it usually is not eatable. At Henry however, it is actually quite tasty. They have a small selection of hot foods (Scrambled eggs, baked beans, sausage, bacon, etc) and also a nice selection of sweet cakes and the likes (Probably because of lots of spanish guests who needs their sweets in the morning), some fruit, bread and cereals. I would call it a great 3 star breakfast or a decent 4 star... All in all, I would say that the staff were great (At least to us) and the location is always perfect for me in Bayswater.

It was not too difficult to put two and two together and work out that 'the hot water is not working' was just another excuse!! Another 2 guests who arrived after me, were able to stay on the floor where 'the hot water was not working' (the staff did not know that I was listening) & were told there was no problem with the water...when I told them what had happened to me!!

If however you are looking simply for a bed in central London that is near both Circle and Central line tubes, I guess you could do worse, (not sure how but certain you could) Would I stay again ???

I would not give it a 1 Star. Most of the staff were nice, one particular member of the reception staff was truely bad. The Room: For a 4 Star room, the room was dirty - water marks on the ceiling, dirt marks on the carpet, flaking paint. The room was tiny - barely enough room for the bed and a wardrobe. I would have expected some more space in this room. The bathroom was too small, and made me claustrophobic - Something I do not suffer from. Facilities: The swimming pool was nice, it was clean. BUT the water was very cold - I would estimate at 5 Celcius. Too cold to swim. The sauna was small, and adequate. Food: We did not have any food at this hotel, as they charged 10 UK Pounds for breakfast - We ate out. Overall, the price of the room - \u00a3120 per night was too high for the facilities we got, if this included breakfast then MAYBE it would be OK. The policy of this hotel is to take payment when you arrive, then when you leave they want payment again - they then refund the first payment when you leave. This was very worrying as I needed nearly 1000 UK Pounds for both payments available, this was our honeymoon and money was allocated to different things. Finally, when I asked to see the manager, this person was not present - I could have expected this. I completed the comments card, and requested that they write to me detailing the points I made to them. I am still waiting for the letter to my points.

The hotel has NO smoking rooms anymore. The hotel is a bit out of the way for those who want to be where all the action is (Central London) but personally i liked that. It is easy to reach by tube or bus. The 390 bus takes you almost to the door from Oxford street, Picadilly or Soho. Overall, i liked the hotel, liked the location and would return. We didnt eat in the area but there are two greek restaurants next to the hotel and a few small stores to buy chips, candy etc. The inside pool is very small but never went in.

The hotel is 2 minutes away from Bayswater (Hyde Park), 5 minutes away from Queensway, a super cosmopolitan street where you have a wide choice of restaurants. If you like italian, try Bella Italia. The 2 Tube station (Queensway and Bayswater), one with circle line the other with central line give you easy access to the main attractive places in London. It's a good idea to buy a 3-day Travel card and use the bus and tube as much as you want to. If you go to London with the objective of staying for long in the hotel room, choose other hotel.
