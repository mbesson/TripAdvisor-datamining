We did not take breakfast mainly because we prefer to enjoy local food, not hotel universal stuff to fill in your stomach. Becides, there is a wonderful bakery - cafe just 2 minutes away on the cross of Deputacio and Rambla, called Rambla 31 - wonderful fresh juices, sandviches, pastry and salads. We had breakfasts there all three mornings. As correctly noted by previous reviewers, the service at the hotel is quite poor. At check in they did not bother to mention that the safe needs a key (instead of usual digial lock) and that you have to come downstares to pick it up and return it on check out or you will be charged 20 euros for loosing it. They did not bother to ask if we need wifi passwords (which other hotels do not do too but after walking to get our safe key it was a bit too much). They were of no help with suggesting place to eat. Nor they bothered to help you with your laggage. And, hey, do not put your plastic hotel card near the phone - we had to come back down to reception to recharge them three times (could be more, if I had not asked the reception for the reason). And if you do care what you see out of the window please note that the opposite building is under construction. These were few downsides but since we did not spent much time at the hotel they did not bother us too much. However, I would not go there again.

Room rate was very competitive for this location, but the room was very small, and very HOT with no way to cool it off. This was in November, and it was very hard to sleep. There was one window which opened to a light shaft (a 3-meter by 3-meter open space that lead up to the roof) plus a tiny window in the bathroom that opened to the elevator shaft, but even leaving them open all day, the room was HOT HOT HOT. There was no AC available, and no fans at the front desk. In the summer, the AC might be activated, and the rooms could be cooled off, but I would not stay here again in the winter. The breakfast buffet was simple but good. The bed was comfortable. There is no clock in the room. This was a problem, as SpanAir had smashed my travel alarm INSIDE my luggage! The in-room internet was not working for a day or two, but eventually got fixed. As a backup, there was wireless available in the lobby, but with several users on it, it was so slow at times to be worthless. Did I mention the room was very small? It would be very cramped for two people, although the bathroom was big enough to have two sinks. The TV had limited selections in English, and even more limited in other languages. This is in contrast to another hotel I'd stayed at just previously, that had a good selection of channels in all major languages. What's great about Eurostars Cristal Palace is it's location and price (at least at the time I was there, in late November). The younger front desk staff was enthusiastic and helpful, and one young woman went out of her way to help me find a voltage adapter so I could plug in my shaver.

On check in found the staff very cool. Dont expect smiles or a welcome. The room was clean but very small and claustrophobic. It was ok for us but anyone with morebaggage would have found it a bit tight. The only window had no view unless call a wall two meters from it a view (cue claustrophobia). If this would bother you I would request a room with a terrace these appear to be roomier too! None of these things were a dealbreaker as we werent spending much time in the room with being out and about during the day. However the first day our room was cleaned when we got in at the end of the day the universal adapter we had (which I had left plugged into my hairdryer in the wall) was missing very frustrating as with phones to charge etc it was an essential item. Needless to say the staff were useless when asked about it and we never got to the bottom of where or why it was gone. The cleaner didnt speak any english and having talked to 3 different staff on reception we were fobbed off and made feel ridiculous! One thing that has to be said is if your a light sleeper be warned the walls are paper thin you can hear doors slamming, shower from other rooms, cleaners battering (yes BATTERING) the floors with the hoover first thing in the morning. I would be known to sleep through anything but even I found it a bit wearing and my partner who is a very light sleeper was getting frustrated by day 3!! That aside it has to be said otherwise the hotel was located perfectly a small walk to plaza catalunya and top of the ramblas, metro station very close too (worth getting a 4 day pass for 21 euros for unlimited trips on train and bus tram etc). Some lovely places to eat if you exit to the right of the hotel and cross the road heading for Catalunya station. However if you like your coffee's big go to starbucks most cafe's and bars serve very small cups where you get little more than a mouthful or two. There were two computers downstairs left of reception that were free to use internet which is helpful. Tea/coffee facilities would have been nice but again not a dealbreaker.

But: - We had a room directly behind the elevator and every time the elevator is moving you hear it through the thin walls. This can be very annoying. - Our standard room was very small. There was not even enough space to put a second suitcase. The bed was only queen size. - Small was also the bathtub. On the one hand, the bathtub was equiped with massage jet streams, but the tub is so small it is only useful for kids. - There is no way to control the room temperature. Only the fan speed is controlable. - Breakfast is quite expensive, I would recommend to buy breakfast somewhere else.

Due to a medical conference in town, finding a hotel with available rooms was a bit of a chore, however with the help of the internet, we were able to find the Eurostars Cristal Palace just two weeks before arrival. Shocked by the rate (\u20ac450/night), we hoped for a luxo-wannabe hotel (like the Crown Plaza) and the location was definitely good. We had stayed at the Eurostars in Leon (which we liked a lot and found to be a good value for money). We expected a welcome jug of water with fresh mint in it upon arrival, a traditional welcome. Well, not so fast...this is the metropolis of Barcelona and they have their \u201cdignity\u201d here and this gets in the way of customer service sometimes.... We really should have felt lucky that our rate was only \u20ac450, given that the \u201cregular rate\u201d posted at the front desk: \u20ac800/night!! A quick check of the real life going rates for this property revealed an average rate of \u20ac89 in the summer and \u20ac115 during the fall. So our rate was 5 times the going rate and this was without breakfast. We \u201cshamed\u201d the manager into throwing in breakfast (\u20ac12 value) for nothing. This was about OK for the price \u2013 (prefab scrambled egg-like substance), but overall edible stuff. The room was reasonable size and freezing cold (AC was either on full or off \u2013 hot and sticky). Cheap laminate paneled floor thudded terribly, but was clean. The beds were reasonably comfortable and no bed bugs (on Googling the hotel, one reviewer complained of \u201cUna habitaci\u00f3n con chinches). The bath tub was so narrow that a 120 lbs woman would not extricate herself out of it after a bath, but again, clean. The all in one \u2013 shampoo, body gel and Holy Water was all we got with the tub, not even washcloths. One square inch by \u00bc thick of clear blue soap (pretty color) and new soap only once the original bar has well worn down. Don\u2019t ask for any tissues either! Toilet paper? Yes! Tissues? No! There was a bidet however, a welcome luxury in this hot climate. The Wi-Fi internet did not work the entire time and the manager insisted that it was my computer\u2019s fault (same one that was connected to Wi-Fi just a few hours ago in UK). The crowd of people with their laptops in hand waiting to plug in to the one available Ethernet cable in the lobby nook (\u201cbusiness centre\u201d) proved otherwise. We were dazzled though, by the midsized flat screen TV and ample wall outlets for computers, handy chargers etc. All in all we were disappointed that this budget business hotel managed to charge like the LeGrand in Paris and deliver like a Holiday Inn Express in an industrial area somewhere in Europe.

We chose Barcelona for a short break because of very cheap Ryanair flights from Bournemouth, near where we live, and not having been to Barcelona before, we thought we should give it a try. Hotel first: Functional, clean, comfortable. Our room 204 on 2nd floor, overlooking street, bit noisy but what do you expect from a city hotel. Staff were always there and seemed to be doing their job well enough, I don't always expect bright, smiley faces, simple courtesy is good enough. Did not use the bar, never seemed that busy. Did not eat at the hotel either so, as you can gather, our requirements were for a hotel in a good location with a clean & comfortable room in which everything worked. We got that, although we do have a couple of gripes about the hotel. The walls are very thin. The couple next door were clearly (and in the lady's case very audibly) enjoying a romantic getaway (good for them) I just wish I hadn't heard it all. Also, on Thursday afternoon we heard a street protest and looked out of the window to find there were about 40 or 50 protesters with banners and leaflets, loudspeakers etc, protesting against the hotel! No idea why, so we went out and when we came back it was all over, my wife asked at reception if it was likely to happen the next day, and reception said in matter of fact fashion \"Oh no, it only happens on Thursdays\" - what's that all about? The real advantage of the hotel is the location - just north of the gothic quarter in the upmarket shopping and commercial district. A brisk 20 minute walk to the port, 5 minutes to the Placa Cataluyna, 10 minutes into the gothic area, and 15 minutes in pretty well any direction, safe streets, nice shops and some decent eateries, with close walkable access to some of Gaudi's finest to the north and north east. If you're still with me, our views of Barcelona: Big, noisy, with too much traffic (even La Ramblas has two way traffic with a pedestrianised main thoroughfare right down the middle, frankly a little tacky, don't really get what all the fuss is about), generally more expensive than we expected, overall not hugely impressed with Barcelona. Simple tapas lunch for two near the Picasso museum in guide recommended eatery, with two tiny glasses of house wine each, with coffee, 40 euros, not great either. Good steak dinner for two with bottle wine & coffee, 90 euros (try Viento del Plato, imported Argentinian aged steaks). Gothic quarter is quaint enough with its alleys and squares, but no more so than many southern European historic centres. North of the gothic quarter is laid out in a block pattern, USA style, with wide avenues and streets, designer shops, a few bars, restauarnts, business etc, where the hotel is. Sagreda La Familia is basically just a construction site inside, don't pay to go in, see it for free from the outside. Tip for tour bus users, don't go for the big orange route (as we did), instead go for the red & blue bus routes which are more flexible and you are more likely therefore to use.

The beds are very firm, however the size of room and the hard beds are not unusual for hotels in Europe. The hotel was very clean, bathroom in our room 605 was modern and spotless, the towels were changed daily. The front door staff was not too friendly, but professional and helpful with tour and show reservations. Complementary use of computers is a benefit, make sure to request to print the boarding passes if you wish to do so, since there is no printer generally, but exceptions are made for boarding passes. We did not eat at the hotel, but the bar was pleasant enough after day of sightseeing. Overall, hotel is functional and clean, but at best 3 star. Would recommend for travelers who plan on sightseeing and spending littel time inside if you can get a good deal.

Our stay at the Eurostars was a wedding gift so we didn't have a choice. We did check the reviews and a lot is right. The location is convenient without being too much in the middle of it all. And since we stayed slightly off the beaten path, we got to see more of Barcelona for it. I have heard about the standards of some of the hotels in Europe; small rooms, small beds & thin walls. So when we got there, we were grateful we had a large bed. The room however was on the small side. The bed was as hard as a rock and had a wire sticking out of it, a spring perhaps. We noticed it was actually two twin beds pushed together as opposed to the king size it was disguised as. This made getting over jet-lag that much more difficult. The people at the front desk were not very nice unless we spoke spanish and even then they always made me feel like I was bothering them. Although it seemed like a nice hotel from the outside looking in, I do have higher standards and found this one to be subpar. Then again, I've never stayed at another hotel in Europe, but next time I am definitely choosing a Marriott if just for a good night's sleep.

The hotel we felt was very basic for the price we paid, far too expensive. I had requested a room on a low floor which was taken note of. The room was small, with twin beds pushed together instead of a double. Apart from the bin having the previous guests rubbish in it was very clean. I told the maid about the bin not being emptied and she cleaned it immediately. The staff spoke a little english but were helpful when I asked for directions and about the airport bus. The only main problem was the saturday I could not sleep because of the noise from the road and the traffic outside. Sunday night was quieter. We would reccommend this hotel for location but not for value for money. Thank you for the people who advised on here about the bus touristic which was excellent the best way to get around. My boyfriend was very disappointed because we went to the barcelona football stadium and it was closed for the tour. We went at 4pm on sunday but it closed at 2.30 that day. The cable cars were very good with a wonderful view. Apart from not seeing the stadium we had a lovely time. Also thank you to the person who suggested fresh & ready bakery they sell the best ham and cheese croissants i have ever had. Other advise I give is watch your bags and pockets at all time.

The staff were very helpful, the hotel was clean and well cared for, recently refurbished, and the rooms were ample in size and a great location for the underground system, tourist bus and La Ramblas. Some minor niggles about the hotel were that the room was so warm that you needed the window open all night, which was OK as there wasn't any significant street noise. If you like hot food for breakfast then there wasn't a great choice - frankfurter sausage, fatty bacon, sloppy scrambled eggs and half tomatoes with a bit of cheese on, however there were ample cereals; cakes; fruit; croissants; yoghurts etc. which more then made up for the poor hot food choices. Don't expect a great view if you have a room at the back of the hotel as 1st-8th floors look onto the back of a building. Poor amount of hanging space if you are going for longer than a few nights - just one small single wardrobe providing coat hangers that unclip from the rail, and x3 small drawers. Take a kettle if you like a cuppa first thing in the morning too as this hotel doesn't provide one. None of the above spoilt our holiday, as I said these were just minor niggles, overall this is a great hotel in a superb location - between the Pg de Gracia and Rbla de Catalunya, only about 5 mins walk to the Placa Catalunya where the tourist bus, ticket office is and where you can pick up both the blue and red line buses, also the top of La Rambla. There are 2 metro stations close to the hotel's street on Pg de Gracia + a tourist bus stop for the red line (which you need to visit the Segrada Familia) We had a wonderful time in Barcelona and found their transport system so refreshingly organised and easy to use.

The first floor had a bathroom with a shower and sink (no full size bath), a small alcove with a twin bed, and a large living room with a TV, small desk, two couches, and windows opening to the interior of the city block. We had no noise problems whatsoever, although I suspect that's because we were on the interior of the block. The kids really enjoyed having some privacy and their own beds.

Several minor complaints about the room... 1) Other than the bathrooms, everything is very open, so everyone can hear everything despite the large size 2) The TV controllers for the 2 TV's would sometimes affect both TV's. So someone watching TV downstairs, for example, could end up changing the channel or such on the one upstairs. One night, one of our neighbors ending up turning on our TV during the middle of the night while we were asleep. 3) The kitchen is locked and they will not allow you access to it.

The location was absolutely subperb; far enough from the hustle and bustle of Las Ramblas to be quiet, but only a quick walk in any direction to some of BCN's most popular attractions, not to mention two metro stations. We walked EVERYWHERE from this hotel, and felt very safe at all times. The neighbohood is great. The staff spoke perfect English and were very pleasant. The in-room hydromassage tub was an excellent bonus after long days on foot; we filled it up with hot water and had our own private hot tub/foot massage. Also, the lobby had two computers with free high-speed internet access, which was great. Had no problems getting a room on a non-smoking floor. One thing that would have been nice was an iron for our travel-weary clothes; there was an ironing service available, but no in-room iron and board. Also, no clock in the room, though this is apparently the norm in many European hotels. The walls were generally thick enough, although one night, a neighbor had a crying baby that was definitely audible. Finally, the BBC TV channel was out all but one day of our stay, but after all, we weren't there to watch TV (!). We found a great package deal on Travelocity that included our stay at the Cristal (what you'll need to call it when you tell taxi drivers where to drop you off) and our flight, so it was also an excellent deal.

After reading the reviews before we left I decided to book this hotel. The rates seemed reasonable, although varied during the time of our stay, (btwn E147 - E179, and the location can't be beat. It is on Deputacion, one block from Passaige de Gracia, and one block from Placa Catalunya. Anna at the front desk took very good care of us, but I can't say the rest of the staff was over eager to make one feel welcome. Only one night of our reservtions came with breakfast, but I wouldn't pay for it if I had to. There are plenty of cafes around the area. Our room overlooked the back and was very clean and quiet, although not overbearingly large. The room came with robes (nice touch) and a whirlpool bath. Ask for a room in the back. Our vacation did not start well at the airport upon arrival. We landed in terminal A and our luggage was at terminal B, but no one told us..along with other Americans on the flight. When we asked staff at the airport to point us in the direction of the baggage claim, they did not speak English, nor were they interested in helping. The cab drivers on the all in all do not speak English, and a cab should only cost you around E20-25 to the heart of the city. It cost us E24. Please be aware, that there is a different rate on the weekends (higher), and that they charge you $2 for every bag placed in the trunk. In fact we think the cab driver taking us to the airport on Sunday really took us for a ride even though the traffic was nearly nil, the meter read E3.75 before we drove away from the curb, and the ride back cost us E31.75 with one less bag in the trunk.

We got everywhere really quickly; rarely had to take a taxi. (Only twice, returning from Port Vell/Barceoloneta). We walked right out of the hotel, down two blocks to Placa Catalunya, onto the Ramblas and right down to the Port. The hotel is one block above Gran Via (a primary east-west route, connecting Placa Espanya and Placa Catalunya, and along which the aerobus from the airport runs), and thus, two blocks north of Placa Catalunya. You can catch a bus on Gran Via that runs all the way up Montjuic to the Fundacio Juan Miro. The hotel is Located between Rambla Catalunya (the CALM Rambla) and Passieg de Gracia (main N/S boulevard with Gucci, Chanel, Zara, and spectacular modernisme buildings, including Casa Battlo.) We were no more than two minutes walk to either Placa Catalunya station or Passeig de Gracia station, so that we could connect directly to the four major metro trains in BCN. Also, Passeig de Gracia has a commuter rail station, at which you can the line that goes south to Sitges, for a day trip to a gorgeous beach town. You are also a stone's throw from the BCN tourist center. When we'd go to the old city, and had become pleasantly overwhelmed by the cacaphony, stepping out into L'Eixample was like breathing clean air. And arriving at the Cristal Palace (whose name I could not say without a giggle) and stepping through the strange semi-circular automatic doors, was yet another level of peace. The hotel itself is quite comfortable -- if you, like me, have read all the other reviews, you'll read that there is a tad bit of noise that commingles from room to room, and that the rooms are small, but it's nothing a city dweller isn't used to. The room we stayed in was well planned, with a low and small scale decor and huge, double glazed windows that made it seem much larger. As for street noise, the new windows completely eliminate it. Expect cool polished marble floors throughout, huge bath with double sink, big tub, gentle A/C, freshly ironed linens daily, careful and considerate room service and housekeeping. (If you sleep past noon, your room will still be cleaned.) Most of the guests we met were mature folks (of all ages) and the hotel is set up to handle people keeping all hours. The desk staff speak many languages, and are helpful. I was concerned about privacy in such a small space, and yet I never felt intruded upon. Ice machines would be a nice touch, but you can ask at the desk for a bowl. The hotel has some free newspapers (including the Herald Tribune in English, with an El Pais English insert) located back by the breakfast area. I never did figure out the espresso machine centrally located on our floor across from the lift. Frankly, I don't think it adds to the charm of the hotel. In Barcelona, if you drink coffee, cafe con leche is one of the most sublime pleasures. Why would we give that up for a powdered creamer and coffee from a foil-wrapped tablet? By all means, try the chicken and avocado sandwich via the 24-hour room service. The mini-bar is reasonable! The Pictory resturant on premises is expensive and elegant, and we didn't try it, but one day when we wandered in in search of the chicken sandwich, the waitress was gracious and helpful as she settled us in the bar area and presented us with a room service menu. And THEN we ordered a pitcher of sangria made by the barman in the most skillful way: it was amazing, with spices, anise, fresh fruit, cold: a perfect beverage for a steamy summer BCN afternoon. We didn't do the breakfast -- there's a cafe immediately across the street and another one to the right, as you walk out, where they have fresh-squeezed oj (zumo) and if you ask nicely, they'll make you a cheese omelette. Also, on Passeig de Gracia, on the corner, the Vaca Paca has a 10 euro buffet libre dinner. As we were on a tight budget (spending $1000 each for 12 nights in BCN) we took advantage of it once or twice and it's well worth it. My sister and I spent 12 nights, cheek by jowl in BCN on a limited budget, and felt pampered and protected at the Hotel Cristal Palace.
