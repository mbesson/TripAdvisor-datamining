On our second to the last day, my Dad and I decided to split up so we could shop without pressuring the other. The problem was they only provided one key. So my dad left the key with them and asked the girl in the front desk that its possible that his daughter would be picking up the key, whoever was first to arrive. I arrived first, another receptionist was up front, he asked me to wait since they were not allowed to give out keys. Luckily, the girl remembered what my dad asked. :D The buffet was good, just don't compare it to 4-5 star hotels. The location is near an MTR Station so it is very convenient for those who are always on the go. But if you are coming from the airport, I suggest just take the MTR and forego the bus trip or taxi trip. The traffic can be quite bad in the middle of the day. It is also near 2-3 malls so you always have a place to wander in. It's beside a 7-11 so you know you will not go hungry or run out of essential supplies :) If I had just one complain, its the fact that the rooms are close to each other and the walls are thin, so you can literally hear the other occupants go to the toilet or use the shower, and if chatter, you will hear that too. But since we were always dead tired from all the walking and looking around, it wasn't a big deal. Basically, if you are on a budget, this is a great hotel to stay in and you wouldn't feel robbed of the money that you paid for it. Its great for those who are on business trips and even those who are on leisure trip that are always exploring and touring. Not for those people who want the extravagant hotel experience.

It is not a touristy area but more of a local neighborhood that offers all the modern conveniences, it has a lot of eateries around it, local ones and the usual Spaghetti House, Cafe de Corral, MacDonalds. Tsuen wan Station is on the Redline which other end station is Central Staion .(business district). Only 30 minutes away and no need to transfer trains when you have business to attend to in the cbd. As for sleep quality, it is true what others said that the beds are small and hard., but for Asians with small frame, size of room and bed is okay. The first night I tossed and turned a lot because of the hard bed, but on the second nighr after spending all day in DIsneyland, I was so tired that I nodded off immediately after hitting the sack, the next moment I know it is morning already. Twin sharing rooms we got just has a shower stall which is okay, since I am not a fond of bath tubs. They provide basic toiletries and paper slippers for the guests.

I am too frustrated to tell you all the things thats wrong with this hotel. My conclusion the only reason you should stay here would be that its the only last available 3 star and above hotel in the whole of hong kong. I did not have a mainland visa. If I did I would have rather moved to shenzen and comuted daily to hong kong from shenzen rather than stay in this hotel thats how fed up with this place.", "Date": "October 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manila, Philippines", "Title": "\u201cNot a good hotel at all\u201d", "Author": "dr_dohh", "ReviewID": "UR84403825", "Content": "My 50+ office colleagues all stayed here on our company outing.

Literally, there was no place for two medium hardcase suitcases. The distance between one bed and the other was less than 2 feet. I cannot imagine how my 6 foot tall office mates can sleep in such a small bed. I gave 2 stars since it wasn't dirty. Outside the room there was nothing remotely interesting. A 7-11 beside the hotel is the nightlife, and a few 'meh' malls are in close proximity. One upside this hotel has is that its close to the metro train system, plus its about 20 minutes away from HK Disneyland. Another one is that they have free breakfast.

The Airport Express is about 5-7 minutes walk away and the Airbus drops you outside the door. Don't bother with the MTR Airport Express as you still have to change trains and walk 5 minutes up and down steps and flyovers. The bus is a third of the price, easy, comfy and you get to see the area and it is about the same time (45 mins) and has an automated stop announcement in English so you know when to get off . Clean but small rooms. Yes the rooms are as small as everyone says. The beds are smaller than standard doubles both in width and length and are very very firm. Yet if you are here to see Hong Kong and not to spend a lot of time in your room then it is fine. They are clean and the bathrooms are functional. The TV even has some English channels. Accommodating staff. We got put on a smoking floor but had requested non smoking when booking via a UK agent so if you hate smoking and the smell of smoke make sure you request this when booking as there are only 3 out of 16 floors that are non smoking. We moved after 2 nights when a room became available and were very grateful for this. The smell of smoke hits you quite badly as you step out of the lift and it seeps through under the bedroom door. It is not pleasant. Bad Things Distance from Hong Kong Despite being close to the metro, it is still a 40 minute train ride until you get to HK Island. If you can afford to stay closer to Kowloon it would be better. We stayed over NYE and we had no choice as it was the only place in our budget available. No ventilation. The windows do not open and the room gets quite stuffy and with condensation. The air con works well but has a funny smell to it. Not good if you re stuck on a smoking floor! The buffet breakfast. It costs $HK42 if booked in advance but if you like healthy breakfasts it is not worth it as it is mainly deep fried stuff. There are numerous caf\u00e9s or bakeries in the area where you can get a better breakfast for slightly less. No WiFi. There is one PC on the 6th floor where it costs $HK30 per hour to use but no centralised WiFi which is a shame given it is such a modern hotel. Noise. The walls are paper-thin. Even with earplugs we could hear the screeching and high pitched talking of the neighbours and their TVs. Lifts. There are only 2 lifts and on one occasion we had to wait over 10 minutes to get down the lobby. Every time we started to walk down the stairs another lift would stop but with staff in there with trolleys etc. There doesn't appear to be a service lift and they use the main lifts.

Tsuen wan is a very interesting town. Due to it being out of the central of HK, the prices in shops are cheaper. there are a lot of restaurants, cheap and expensive and also 2 supermarkets at eaither end of the town. Regards to shopping, there are loads of shops and several huge department stores. Big bonus is that because its out of the main parts, less tourists, therefore less hassle from people trying to sell you fake bags/watches! The hotel is very basic and the rooms are small but its very cheap, so you pay for what you get. you get a tv with about 15 channels, most are chinese. bathroom is clean, yet small, but all working order. From the airport, its takes about 30 mins by train, about 45 mins to an hour by bus depending on route and traffic. Now the bad points: first: take your own pillow, mine was like a brick second: the staff dont speak that good english, so best to know where you want to go and how to get there before hand. thirdly, and probably the biggest problem for a lot of people, is that it isnt near HK island. the subway from Tsuen wan to TST takes roughly 25 mins, so its not too bad, plus the trian is very cheap and its direct to central Kowloon and HK Island. you have to way up paying extra for a more central hotel copared to travel expenses. i personally think transport is very cheap so it will always win. plus on the train, you see a lot of interesting characters. its a budget hotel so dont expect alot but whenever i go to hong kong, i aim to stay there as its cheap, friendly surroundings, and easy access to all of hong kong wether it be by train or bus", "Date": "July 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rochester, NY", "Title": "\u201cSmall room for small people but nice view.......\u201d", "Author": "The-Nice-Brit", "ReviewID": "UR16416446", "Content": "My wife and I stayed in this hotel during a trip to visit her family in Tsuen Wan.

However, the rooms were definitely clean and bathrooms I give thumbs up. If you brought along bulky luggages - definitely a problem , it's good my husband just brought along 2 carry-all bags while I have a medium size luggage which we placed along the foot of my bed - very small room left to get to the bathroom. Airconditioning was great- actually had to shut it off by midnight- we were freezing. Most guests complained about the hard beds- for me they were perfect- I had a back problem and this is what I needed. Now for the staff - I am impressed by their courteousness and especially the Conceirge (?) he was a big guy at the hotel lobby who wore dark rimmed glasses - always had a smile in his face. serves as a good public relations in behalf of the hotel. Same with those at the recep- although sporting really serious faces they were quite accomodating.", "Date": "May 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cBudget hotel with pleasant design\u201d", "Author": "KikiMalaysia", "ReviewID": "UR6894041", "Content": "Overall, this hotel is worth for money. The design is good, furnitures are new as it was only open in October, 2006, staffs are quite friendly and it is strategically located. This hotel is located in Tsuen Wan and it's about 10mins walk from the Tsuen Wan MTR station, which will be the most frequent place that you would go in HK. From HK airport to the hotel, I suggest to take the A31 citybus and get down in front of the citistore shopping complex (second last station). Public transports, e.g. bus, taxi, MTR, HK-style restaurants and 7-eleven are all easily accessible. The only drawback of this hotel is the rooms are not soundproof. During our stays in the hotel, most of the rooms are occupied by tourists from the Mainland and we could hardly sleep later than 8am as the tourists were making so much noises in the aisle as well as their rooms. They were running from a room to another and slammed the doors, this incident repeated every morning for not shorter than half an hour and it was totally unbearable.", "Date": "March 1, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Silka Far East Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d628550-Reviews-Silka_Far_East_Hotel-Hong_Kong.html", "Price": "$71 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">No.135-143 Castle Peak Road, Tsuen Wan, Kowloon</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Hong Kong</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">China</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "628550", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/8b/5f/1e/silka-far-east-double.jpg"}}
