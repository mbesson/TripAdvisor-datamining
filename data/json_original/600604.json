This one disappointed. While the website advertised self parking on property - you have to put up with and pay for ($15 per day) for valet parking. And they double charged several parties including us for parking, which was slowing down checkout. They added a fee ($10.35) to our bill for a \"hotel Tarriff\". As far as we could see it was only added for Priceline customers, so it can be negotiated off the bill if you stick to your guns. The charge does not appear on the website. The building and rooms are truly wierd. The bathroom is built is such a way that the toilet seat will not stay up. I guess women may appreciate that. But figuring out how to flush the toilet is a real challenge, you have to get down on your knees and search. The shower curtain was not quite long enough, so there was no way to avoid a puddle on the bathroom floor. The bed was slanted, and very soft. There is only one elevator to serve about 10 floors. We were lucky to be on the second floor and could walk. But watch your head, the passageway won't accomodate a 6 foot person at some points. (In any real emergency, people are going to get hurt.) And, the pool is on the North or West side of the building, so it does not get sun most of the day. The area is a business area, definitely not a resort/vacation/beach/tourist area. That said, you can reach Old San Juan, or the Condado beaches in a short time. There are 2 or 3 decent restaurants in the neighborhood, plus 2 in the hotel. Allow 45-60 minutes for breakfast - they only cook one order at a time. The service staff was the redeeming point - quite up to Marriott standards.

It just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look and feel safe. There were street people and drunks less than two blocks from the hotel begging for money and drinking openly in broad day light. There were police patrolling in the area and when they were around it felt safer. The hotel only has valet parking that costs $15 a night and no self parking was offered. I ask for other parking options and was told I could park on the street but may not be safe and secure for the car. The hotel allowed the car to be checked in and out as many times I wanted and there were no problems with car damage or wait time. The restaurant was OK and the pool was OK. The hotel room was clean and the bed was comfortable. The room had free internet. We upgraded to an executive room and was not worth the money because the front desk put us in Room 901 that was next to the elevator. When ask at check-in if the room was next to the elevator, we were told by the front desk person it was next to the elevator but we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be bothered with elevator noise. But we did hear the elevator all the time we were in the room especially at night going up and down. It sounded just like a jet taking off from inside an airport terminal. The front desk staff was aware that it stated inside my Marriott profile and because I told them that we wanted to be away from the elevator. If we were told the elevator could be annoying and heard inside our room we would have requested a different room. We were told on check-out by the Front Desk Manager it was the only room of that type in the hotel. I told her also if we would have known the elevator could be heard in the room and sounded like a jet taking off we would have change rooms. To her credit the manager did credit 4000 Marriott points to our account upon checkout but only after we ask for some type of compensation because they were misleading. Because I believe the Courtyard by Marriott in Miramar wanted to fill a room just to fill a room even if that means not being completely open with a quest even when directly ask the question about elevator noise I will never stay there again because \"I DON'T LIKE TO BE MISLEAD\" from the front desk staff upon check-in.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Quad Cities, IL", "Title": "\u201cPre & Post Cruise Hotel Alright Stay\u201d", "Author": "King61256", "ReviewID": "UR126996083", "Content": "I am a frequent traveler for business and rack up the Marriott points pretty quick so for a 'free' room with points, I won't complain (much).

Both visits were for one night before a cruise. As other reviewers have noted, this hotel is not located in a touristy area. We were able to go for a walk and find a grocery store down the street for snacks and some pre-made sandwiches. But for the most part, options within walking distance are limited. The rooms are spacious and clean, but they have thin walls. Our room during our first visit was by the elevator, the noise kept us up all night. Our second visit I specifically requested to be away from the elevator. Man, I would have given my right eye to listen to the elevator that night. We had a roomful of rowdy boys above us. They were up rough housing and laughing until 3am. We called the front desk and had them intervene, but that didn't help. We thought we'd have the last laugh when our crying toddler woke them up in the morning, but those boys were up bright and early making all sorts of noise. When checkout rolled around, we packed up and headed for the elevator. Yes, singular. There is one elevator for the entire hotel, all 10 floors. Checkout time is completely absurd. We waited as it stopped at every floor going up, then every floor going down. Every time it reached us it was stuffed full of people. With three bags and a stroller, the stairs were not an option. After 10 minutes we decided desperate times called for desperate measures. Despite being on the third floor, we pressed the up button. We got on the elevator and stopped at every floor going up, filling up around floor five, then turned people away as we stopped at every floor going down. Just getting from our room to the lobby took 20-25 minutes. We ate breakfast at the hotel restaurant. Despite a lobby jammed with people, the restaurant was fairly empty. It was here that we got our first taste of \"island time\". With three waitstaff on duty it took almost two hours for us to order and eat pancakes. There were only people at three tables! Now, we weren't in a hurry because we couldn't get on our cruise ship until early afternoon, so we didn't mind a slow-paced meal. But being a fast-paced, typical American, I found it frustrating. It must be said, that once our meal did arrive, it was delicious. My husband ordered the macadamia nut butter pancakes, which were so fabulous we've been trying to replicate the recipe since we arrived home. The staff was very nice and accommodating to my toddler, and we got unlimited, free sippy cup refills. Despite our negative experiences, I don't have a terrible opinion of the San Juan Miramar Courtyard. The staff has always been very friendly and helpful, the food is delicious if you've got time and patience to spare, and the rooms are clean and comfortable. Just bring earplugs and be ready to huff it on the stairs (or avoid checkout at the peak time).", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville, TN", "Title": "\u201cAnother pre-cruise review\u201d", "Author": "brentwoodmom56", "ReviewID": "UR125108781", "Content": "I have to agree with the other reviewers that this is a great place to stay pre-cruise.

The pool is very small and only 6 lounge chairs, so don't plan to spend an entire day at the pool.

In summary, we were pleased enough with this hotel that we booked a second night directly with the hotel staff. Regarding location, it's not on the beach and it's not in Old San Juan, but it's no more than 10 minutes to these sites so actually it's very well situated. And it's just a block or two from highway 26 so it's an easy juant to the airport and other destinations. There is not a lot to do right where this hotel is located so that may be a turn-off for those wanting to walk to shops or restaurants. And, there are some unsavory neighborhoods not all that far from here so if you need the feeling of luxury and security all around, again, this might not work for you. But truly, Marriott is smart enough not to stick a \"Courtyard\" in a bad area so I really don't think there is any worries here. And, I came to realize that many neighborhoods around San Juan and beyond all have an element of appearing run-down. However, by the end of our first trip to Puerto Rico, I felt extremely safe. Arriving at the hotel...well, it's a one-way street so if you approach on Ponce de Leon and the hotel is on your left, then you are going the wrong way and are likely to be in a bus-lane. As far as I could see, the only option for parking is to turn into the hotel entrance and leave your car with the valet. I never saw where they took my car but that was fine because I didn't want to park it on the street. The parking was $15/day and I tipped a couple bucks when they parked it. This appears to be the norm throughout most of the metro area so no complaints here. I never quite figured out the methodology of the valet attendants as it seemed to differ the two days we were there. Nevertheless, our car was brought up quick enough so no complaints. Inside, the front desk staff were exceptionally friendly. It's amazing how a pleasant attitude makes such a difference. They set us up on the 10th floor in a single bed room and although the room was not huge, it was clean as a whistle and updated. We really have nothing to complain about. The maid service in the morning was great. I left a few bucks and came back from our day adventures to find our belongings nicely arranged, including our toothbrushes set on towels. Again, no complaints. We did NOT take advantage of the pool and restaurant area so we can't comment on that. Overall, I have to give this hotel an \"excellent\" rating because it met all of our expectations. IF you are here on vacation and are wanting to be in the midst of Old San Juan or right next to the beaches, then maybe look elsewhere.

There are businesses with food and such but after dark you have to deal with the shady characters to get there. As a female, no way I'd go out alone after dark. Oh then there are the restaurants, if paying $17 dollars for a burger in fries is your style...go for it. I didn't make this reservation, but my sister Pricelined it and we paid $100 a night!

Not for me. The Courtyard by Marriott-Miramar is near the bus route to Old San Juan and for adults who seek peace and quiet after a long day of touring, I say this is ideal. It's not a resort but it does have an outdoor pools and restaurants inside so there's enough to do here at night if a calm respite is what your after. I felt like a local here coming home to my private apt in the Miramar section. Sure, it's not a bad idea to rent a car but parking in Old San Juan is a hassle on weekend nights and cabs and buses are plentiful. The hotel will help arrange escorted daytrips to El Yunque Rainforest or the Camuy Caves for you. If your somewhat familiar with the \"lay of the land\" in San Juan, you see the value in this property. The only thing that wd enhance this property would be a complementary breakfast or room service but, you'd be smart to just head to Old San Juan to \"La Bombanera\" and enjoy breakfast at the counter with the locals and enjoy a Majjorca Pastry & a Cafe con Leche.

We actually found this hotel through Priceline.com with a bid of just $89 dollars a night. Who could go wrong with that with a rate usually close to atleast $200+. When we arrived late night (around 11:30pm; Cab Ride was $18 from the Airport) the front desk was very polite and helpful. We got to our room after a quick check-in and fell right asleep (I must say the beds are extremely comfortable and clean). However, the next day when we went down to the Lobby it was completely swamped (around 10:30am) and took us nearly 45 minutes just to speak with someone at the Front Desk. The Male Manager there (I don't remember his name) was EXTREMELY helpful with getting us around and even gave us an umbrella because of the sun-showers. However, the only problems we had were the room not being made at nearly 4:00pm when we returned and the RUDE waiters downstairs in the Hotels Resturant. (DO NOT get RIPPED off inside the Resturant, the prices for food is an insult, $8.00 for a Brownie and $19 for a Burger with some fries??!!) Last but not least, the horrfic elevator. I waited nearly 15 minutes a few occasions just to get to the Lobby!! The pool was OK, very small with not much room if theres anymore then 10 people out there. Now, I must say if you don't enjoy walking this is !!NOT!! the place for you as it's located a good distance from the actually fun/night spots in Old San Juan. ($15 cab ride) and about a 20 minute walk to a beach. (You also need to cross a large highway to get the beach which is very unsafe, especially with children) There are a few fast food places directly a block away (Dominos, Papa Johns, Subway etc.) and also a very convient supermarket. The actually city the hotel is located in (Miramar) seems to be somewhat safe at night. I wouldn't want to walk alone though if I didn't have to. A major downside was the amount of homeless people sleeping on the streets (and also begging for change) a block or two from the hotel.

We got a great price per night due to our travel agent arranging a group rate. The front desk staff was very friendly and accommodating. We arrived for our pre-cruise stay about 3 PM. Check-in was quick and pleasant. The rooms are average size for a Courtyard property. Everything was very clean and well maintained. I learned that Marriott had recently purchased and renovated the hotel. My only complaints about the room were its proximity to the elevator shaft. You could hear the elevator whooshing up and down all-night long! Also, the room was EXTREMELY COLD!!!!!! There was no thermostat to attempt to warm things up a bit! Alas, the price paid for vacationing where it never gets cold! There was a restaurant in the hotel, but it was very expensive. There are numerous places to eat within walking distance of the hotel. One place recommended by the staff was the Los Pinos restaurant, about 3 blocks from the hotel. Frankly, the food or the staff did not impress me. My steak sandwich was so tough; I could have soled my shoes with it! The wait staff pretty much ignored us until I complained to management. There are other places nearby (Papa John's Pizza, a Pueblo supermarket (a huge chain supermarket in Puerto Rico) and more!) So, you need not pay those extravagant prices at the hotel restaurant if you don't want to! There is also a U.S. Post Office across the street. I mailed the cruise souvenirs home, thus avoiding the airport hassle of extra baggage! Public transportation is plentiful and cheap. Several bus lines just outside the hotel get you to Old San Juan for just 50 cents. As far as security was concerned, I felt completely safe walking around the area at night. Like any place else, just use a little common sense and avoid areas that even look like they may be trouble. Our post-cruise stay of one night was great! Our cruise ship arrived in San Juan at 7 AM. We were off the ship by 10 AM. We expected a long wait for our room. But, we were pleasantly surprised when our room was ready so early in the day! During the post-cruise stay, we took advantage of the small laundry room in the basement. We washed up the dirty clothes accumulated during the cruise.

For those without a vehicle, there is a bus stop less than a half block away that will take you to Old San Juan, Condado, or wherever else you want to go. We found the neighborhood to be safe and well lit (a mixed residential / business area) As for the property - a recent major renovation has given this property a very sharp appearance both inside and out. Expect the typical Courtyard by Marriot color scheme. The common areas were very clean - with nice marble accents and a free business center with a computer for use by the guests. Check-in was very quick and the staff very pleasant. This property is a bit atypical for a Courtyard Marriot as there is not a true Courtyard per say. There is a small pool at the property and one of the best restaurants in all San Juan (very formal). Our room was a king sized room on the 11th floor. We had a partial view of the lagoon which was a nice touch. As for the room itself it was quite well apportioned - all the usuals you would expect - largre comfortable bed, a business desk and side chair and a standard 25\" TV. The TV was only so-so, but how often do you just hang out in the room to watch TV? The carpets and furniture were new and the carpets fresh with no visible wear. The bathroom was apportioned with marble floors and counters and fresh paint and new modern lighting.

Our room was nonsmoking but every time the air came on it brought the smell of cigarette smoke into the room. The restaurants are very pricey. We attempted to eat breakfast before checkout but walked out without it. The hostess ignored the line and chatted with a group of locals at their table. A couple leaving told us that service was nonexistent and plan to be there at least two hours.", "Date": "March 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cO.k for a short stay.\u201d", "Author": "mjs11505", "ReviewID": "UR14282815", "Content": "My husband and I were there for 5 days/4 nights. Check in was a breeze. Room was very spacious and clean, but still cold even though the thermostat was on warm. After a couple of days there, the maid service showed up, while we were still in the room and we let her come in to do her job. Right before our very eyes, she picked up our glasses and rinsed them out in the bathroom. We were shocked and asked her for clean glasses, but she didn't speak english. No apologies were given. With the price we paid to stay there, we expected better. The valet parking was very good and informative. You will need to rent a car or take a taxi to see tourist areas. There are several places to eat in the area. Next time I will definitely pay a little more for a better hotel close to the beach and in a better area where you can feel safe walking at night. We would have been better off staying in Condado or Isla Verde. Also upon checkout, we ended up being charged for our full stay, even though 1 night was susposed to be free, we used our Marriott Points when booking and the hotel couldn't do anything about it, even though we showed them in writing. They said they never received anything from their home office.", "Date": "March 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "St Paul, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cCourtyard San Juan Miramar - Expect long check-in process and wait\u201d", "Author": "Peregrinator_7", "ReviewID": "UR13536724", "Content": "Stayed 1 night in this hotel the day before (a Saturday) our cruise on the Royal Caribbean. This hotel was ok, but did have a share of problems. The CONS 1) EXPECT long wait for your room! Check-in time to this hotel is 3pm. We arrived at this hotel around 4pm and our room was not ready yet. We had booked 2 rooms. 1 for my husband and I (3rd floor). The other room for my in-laws (11th floor). It nearly took 1 hour before we were given our room key which was not good considering we just got in from a 5 hour flight and had to wait at the SJU airport an hour for our luggage to come out of baggage claim...which is another story. 2) The lights in the room are very dim so you'll have a hard time seeing things in the dark, if you needed to. 3) My in-laws room's (11th floor) air conditioning was not working properly. It was way too cold in the room and the thermostat control was set to the warm side. 4) There is only 1 elevator. The time we stayed, it was out of order, so we had to use the service elevator while it was being fixed 5) Far from the beach. If you want to be close to the beach, it's not in walking distance, you'll need to take a taxi or public bus. The PROs 1) If you just need an overnight stay just for a cruise close (1 mile) to the PAN American Pier where Royal Caribbean ships are docked, the hotel is not bad. 2) The hotel workers were very friendly and informative. They allowed us to keep our luggage in their storage after we checked out. That gave us the ability to see Old San Juan and the Morro Fort 3) Taxis are always available 4) Room was very clean with good decor and comfortable bed 5) Close to Papa John's, Subway, Movie theatre, Dominos, and local puerto rican restaurant. There also is a small bistro at the hotel. So all in all if the wait to get our room was faster, I would have rated this higher. If you want to stay more than 1 day, I wouldn't recommend it. If we go back to San Juan, we probably would try closer to Isla Verde.", "Date": "February 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cNice, but I think I will stay at the Marriott Next time\u201d", "Author": "gvldiva", "ReviewID": "UR12370495", "Content": "To begin the staff was very nice and friendly. They allowed us to leave our luggage after check out while we went shopping before our cruise was to leave out that evening, I cannot say enough about the staff. As for the hotel, it was OK. The bed was comfortable and the room itself was pretty clean. I liked the bathroom until I looked up and saw where part of the ceiling looked to have been leaking alot and the tub has some issues with some mold. I think it is because this building was an old building that had been renovated. I could see where when the painters painted, they just painted over the hinges, etc in the room. I noticed this inside and outside the room. As for the area, it was pretty dead. I think that is because iti was more or less a business district and we were there on the weekend. I will say the room was very quiet. If you are looking for a view, there really isn't one. If I had to do it again and considering how expensive this Courtyard was, I would rather pay the extra money and book at the Marriott in the Condado.", "Date": "January 6, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Courtyard by Marriott San Juan Miramar", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g147320-d600604-Reviews-Courtyard_by_Marriott_San_Juan_Miramar-San_Juan_Puerto_Rico.html", "Price": "$152 - $270*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">801 Ponce de Leon Avenue</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Juan</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">00907</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Puerto Rico</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "600604", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/cb/c7/cbc7488321555adf5bff0799102f19d71large.jpg"}}
