{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great Family Stay This was a great find and a fabulous place to stay when wanting to visit Florence yet stay in the Tuscan hills. Lisa and her family were warm and friendly with a great attitude. Upon arrival our family was welcomed warmly and the gracious Lisa happily upgraded us to their apartment as it was not taken for the two nights of our stay. The rooms were spacious, very clean and had views of both private gardens and of the Tuscan HIlls. A nice place for peace and quiet after the tourist jam of Florence.Breakfast is average, but forgiven once you immerse yourself in the tranquility.", "Date": "Apr 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR948733046", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "OzLou"}, {"Content": "Fell in love with \"La torricella\" Me and my husband went there for a romantic week-end.we had a great time, our room was superb with a wonderfull four-poster and a terrific view on the countryside .The beauty of Florence is just a step from there, the bus stop is not so near almost 500 meters but for us was not a problem we liked to a have a little walk .Breakfast was superb the owner cooked a cake just for the two of us thank you Lisa :-))))We will certainly return there in summer 'cose we want to try the pool !!", "Date": "Dec 21, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR733743350", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "bisaItaly"}, {"Content": "Wonderful place to stay We are a family of 5 and all had a fantastic holiday in Tuscany. La Torricella was perfect for us, Stayed a week there in their apartment. Our days were as follows:- breakfast at 10am, down by the pool by 10.30, relaxing and reading until 3pm, then went into Florence for 3 to 4 hours! Hotel was very clean, people were lovely, enjoyed a fantastic meal on our last night (we cooked it - had a cookery lesson!). We had the place to ourselves, most guests like to go out for the day - their lost..Slight problem with the mossies.. need lots of spray. We did hire a car for the week, and went to Pisa and Siena - both worth the trip.

Every thing is clean comfortable and tidy. and located away from the hubub of Florence in decent countryside but close to the spectacular. Good selection of cereals meats and cheeses for breakfast, 1Euro to bus into Florence in about 25 minutes with several buses an hour. The only downside is that accurate information about details for accessing places of interest, apart from the most famous and popular i.e. entry points and timings is hard to get.More printed and accurate customer info. might be helpful to many", "Date": "Jul 23, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR188476784", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Wonderful B La Torricella is simply a wonderful place. Its location is not that far outside of Florence. It is up the hill from Galluzzo, a charming little town. Our only problem was that we had not clarified the cost of the cooking class. It turns out we were charged 100 euros each and there were 6 of us. And she requested it in cash. It just put a damper on the whole experience. La Torricella is a great spot, just beware of cooking class costs...", "Date": "Jun 20, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR465153656", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Jamie074"}, {"Content": "Nettes Hotel au\u813derhalb von...   showReview(20237803, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR253691741", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Un accueil tres agreable par la...   showReview(17067766, 'full');", "Date": "May 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR785324182", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d238048-r15069807-La_Torricella-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "238048", "Price": "$181"}}
