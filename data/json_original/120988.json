We were upgraded to the Executive Floor due to our Hhonors Gold Status and had a great city view room. The room was clean and spacious with a nice flat screen TV and the Hilton bed we love so much. We did not eat at the restaurant but got a room service pizza which was good for hotel pizza. The only reason that this hotel does not receive an excellent rating is that the location is not the best being at the Airport.

It was NOTHING like First Class check-in at the airport where there are separate agents for us and other agents for the economy people. I will NEVER stay at the Hilton again. The restaurant was a low-class sports bar. They did not have a nice place for drinks. The menu at the restaurant was terrible and the food had no taste at all. It's a terrible place. It does not even compare to the Hilton Hotel that we have here in Osaka, Japan. This place is a dump. It may seem nice to people who have no idea what a classy hotel is meant to be. It must cater to a certain type of person who would be satisfied with such terrible service. The man who checked me in denied that I waited for as long as I did. My two friends with me confirmed that I had not been exaggerating the time. They kept saying, \"Aren't you first in line?!\" But then another couple would walk up to the other line. The 3 idiots at the desk should not have been there for only Hilton Honors guests. There should have been a better system. Don't bother eating in the restaurant. Do not order room service from that terrible restaurant either. 35 dollars for 2 pieces of Boston Cream pie that tasted like plastic was a bit steep. We also got 2 bottles of water with that order.

Overall I'd say that they've managed to keep the high standards of cleanliness but its definitely lost some gloss. It IS still easy to get to from terminal E (international arrivals) and its even closer to terminal A. I like being able to walk to a hotel after a flight - it feels relaxing. You can catch the hotel shuttle too if you are feeling less than energetic. If you are arriving via the T get off the shuttle bus/Silver line at Term A for a shorter walk. We stayed in an exec room on the 10th floor. We decided to use the hotel for a city break and use the T to get to Boston. Firstly, the rooms are adequate in size and nicely furnished. Bathroom looked a little bit tired compared to what I remember but nothing bad. It was very clean. The worst part of the room was that we had a connecting door. This meant that on one night we could hear *everything* our neighbours did/talked about. They arrived late, were very noisy and were the same again very early in the morning - at all costs avoid rooms with a connecting door in order to ensure a good night's sleep! We had no trouble on the other evenings we stayed. The room has everything you need - iron/board, robes, slippers, coffee maker (lavazza coffee), Large flat screen TV (didn't use so cannot comment on quality or channel choice), radio/alarm, phones, safe and laptop tray. You cannot hear any aircraft noise which is amazing. The exec lounge is no longer opened on weekends so breakfast on Sunday was served in the Berkshire restaurant downstairs. This was a pretty good buffet with lots of choice. The rest of the time the breakfast was served in the 10th floor lounge. This was hugely disappointing compared to some other airport Hiltons. All carbs, nothing hot. Bascially its all sugary cereals, pastries and fruit. No protein apart from cold hard boiled eggs. I can't believe that in this day these people still cannot offer some eggs and bacon in the morning - its so easy. But they seemingly want you to go and spend your money in the Berkshire each day - which you have to if bread/cereal is something you can't eat. I just find this lazy and not really catering to HHonors members. We chose to use the Silver Line to get into Boston each day - it goes from the far end of Term A and ends at South Station where you can transfer to the red line or simply walk into downtown (its a very small city) Coming back, its easier to get the blue line to the airport stop and then get off the free airport shuttle at Term A leaving you with a very short walk back to the hotel. The travel was extremely cheap - $15 for a week of unlimited travel via Charlie Card (which is really easy to purchase from the machine at the far end of Term A by Au Bon Pain) - you can use this on the T and on the buses. You can even use it on zone 1 of the commuter rail network. We ate in Connelley's Publik House (a sports bar/pub type of place within the hotel) - service was prompt, food OK (there is an online menu via the website but no prices) - not much atmosphere but it may be people were tired after a day's work/a long flight. At any rate there are much better food choices in town (Legal Sea Foods and The Chart House are right outside the Aquarium T Stop...) Overall I think I'd stay here again - the rooms are warm and welcoming, the hotel is clean and tidy and you can usually get a good rate via the website - we paid $200 per night compared to the $350 ave price of a downtown hotel. I personally think its cheaper than staying Downtown (others may disagree?) and the new(ish) Silver Line gives you good transport connections to the city - very quick and easy in fact. Just beware of the connecting rooms! :)", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cConvenient\u201d", "Author": "PeteD_London", "ReviewID": "UR121755284", "Content": "Convenient but bland hotel.

As others have mentioned, despite being so close to the airport and being surrounded my major roads you hear very little noise and I've had rooms over looking the entrance, the roads, and pointing at the main terminals. There may be a side of the hotel that is more noisy, but it isn't obvious. Breakfast is good and although the selection is somewhat smaller than at other Hilton's it has more that enough for most people.The older serving staff are polite, courteous and will stop and have a chat if you wanting to talk a bout any thing and everything, otherwise they leave you alone to enjoy your breakfast. The bar serves reasonable food if you're wanting a bite to eat of an evening but is a bit dimly lit which can make reading a paper/book a bit of a challenge - better to find a comfortable seat and watch some of the channels on the handful of TV screens they have. Having said I've nothing but positive experiences, the only grumble would be that the left luggage is just put behind the bell hop in the foyer and not secured in any way. Bags have always been returned without any issues, and the counter is visible to a number of reception staff when the counter isn't manned, but still, seeing a big pile of bags/suitcases out in the open makes you wonder how secure they really are. 10 mins after clearing immigration you can be in a decent hotel room, unpacked, showered, and no longer feeling like you've been squashed inside a plane.

We had an early morning flight out of Boston after a week of leaf peeping in the NE and this fit the bill. The hotel is on Boston Logan airport property and our room was quite clean and modern. We enjoyed it very much! The staff was friendly and helpful and our room overlooked the harbor, which was nice. The bathroom had a magnified makeup mirror for the ladies, a nightlight for those who need to get up during the night, and the counter was of granite and plenty wide for all our toiletries. The toiletries provided by the hotel were soap, shampoo, conditioner, lotion and a shower cap. The bed was very comfortable. All the table lamps had electrical outlets (the bedside ones had two, and the desk lamp had at least one and possibly two). The desk had a pullout return for added writing space. We ordered room service and it arrived within 30 minutes and was piping hot and delicious. If we had to find anything to complain about it would be the 3 or 4 automatic fees added to room service (15% service charge, $3.50 eating in room charge, tax and I believe one other that escapes my memory). Also, the hotel did not get a certain national television station that my husband is accustomed to having available in most hotels he frequents (ESPN) and missed a sporting event he was looking forward to watching. But these are minor issues. We did not hear any airplane noise during the night. The hotel runs a complimentary shuttle to the airport terminals. They pick up every 15 minutes at the front door starting at the top of the hour. They will also pick you up at the car rental place if you call and request to be picked up. We found their shuttle to be very punctual. We would stay here again if we needed to be near the airport and would recommend it to others.

I booked the Hilton Hotel at Logan airport for the convenience and familiarity with the Hilton Brand. I have to say that although there were a couple of things that went wrong the friendliness of the staff and willingness to rectify problems outweighed any of the negativity that could be felt with the issues. Firstly the hotel itself is as advertised. Close to the airport, easily reached by either a walkway from Terminal A or E (A being closer) and easy to get into the city itself (the hotel will shuttle you to either the subway or water taxi terminal). Rooms are more than ideal, the breakfast buffet is just right with hot and cold options (what do some people expect in a hotel breakfast buffet!!??) and the beds themselves were comfy for us as a family. The staff were the main plus point (for us). Firstly we arrived a couple of hours before the main checkin time due to our flight being early. I figured we would just leave the bags with a porter and come back later. The front desk agent however found a room available with a King bed (that I had requested but had not been available on internet checkin) and when she was told that the cleaners had not quite finished with that one, found another with an upgraded harbour view. This all being 2 hours before the advertised checkin time. Whilst I was in the process of doing this my wife was playing with my son in the lobby and a kind bellman gave him a packet of crayons and a coloring book to keep him happy and occupied. In a hotel that I would expect to be more oriented towards the business traveller..I found this friendliness towards my child impressive. Secondly All of the drivers we met on the shuttle buses were VERY friendly and helpful...not only with bags but with tips on things to do in Boston itself and pointers on public transport. Third. Received the bill on checkout. An extra room service charge had appeared that we had not used. Spoke to the desk agent. Explained the situation and how it could have happened. Not a single argument or question of my story. Profuse apology and charge taken off the bill. Having read the horror stories at numerous hotels on Trip advisor I found this to be most refreshing (especially as it would have been easy to stall whilst they investigated). The maid service for some reason decided to come into our room at 630am in the morning (I was already out for a meeting) but my wife and son were asleep in the room. This early entry woke both of them up. I was dissappointed on hearing this later as you don't expect to be disturbed at that time..even if we hadn't put up the do not disturb sign. Again when relating this as just a comment to staff at the desk (and it wasn't even a complaint..more just a comment of \"please look into this\") I was given sincere regrets and a small amount taken off the bill by way of apology. I found this level of service excellent and more than enough reason to visit this hotel again. If you are looking for an airport hotel where they treat you as an individual whilst giving you the convenience and comfort you would expect...then I highly recommend the Hilton at Logan airport One note....when returning on subway or water taxi the hotel does not have have a courtesy phone at either of these locations and you are expected to call them on payphone or cell phone in order to get a shuttle bus to pick you up. A bit inconvenient if you either don't have change or have an international cell phone that will stiff you on call rates.

Chose between the Hilton's largely based on price and not location. I however came away thoroughly pleased with my visit. The Hotel was quick walk after my flight and yet is just far enough away that you don't feel like you're at the airport. Check-in was simple and efficient. As a Hilton Diamond I was upgraded to the top floor which offered a nice view of the harbor as well as terminal A. As with most Hiltons, upgrades typically mean the same room on a higher floor. The room was clean, nicely furnished and your typical although modern Hilton decor. The executive lounge is located on the top floor, just over the main entrance. It offers some equally impress views. Those that like plane watching and see them line up over the horizon as the land one after another. The lounge was rarely full, has a few TV's and computers. There was always a concierge present, most days I ran into Gayle. Although I didn't require her services she was always polite, friendly, and greeted everyone as they came in. Breakfast was fresh fruits, toast, hard boiled egg etc. No hot items. Canapes in the evenings seemed to vary from night to night, but there was always two hot choices. The lounge is closed from Friday afternoon until Sunday evening. At check-in I was offered certificates for a continental breakfast on the weekends. The continental breakfast appeared to consist of picking something up at the coffee shop (which serves Starbucks for those of you that are addicted). I inquired about purchasing and upgrade to a full buffet breakfast and was upgraded for no charge for my loyalty. I was more than willing to pay, but a big thumbs up for this gesture that left a great customer service impression. I always leave a little tip for maid service. This is the first hotel where the maid would leave me a little thank you note. Once again, just a little small gesture that although not expected contributes to portray a superior level of interest on the part of the employees. The gym is very nicely equipped, including a pool and hot tub as well as sauna and steam room. I thoroughly enjoy the steam and am always pleased to find this in a hotel. The gym is located just off the lobby, so I was happy to see that it also had changing rooms to avoid walking across the lobby in sweaty clothes. However when I inquired about getting keys to the lockers was told they don't provide them and that they are locked on purpose? Odd, but whatever. Transportation was great, there was always a shuttle outside within a few minutes and they would drop you off at any of the terminals or the train/subway/metro station. The driver seemed quite flexible and appeared to drop people off at many other places, car rental etc. A 7 day metro pass was only $15. A great deal that saves you a car rental, parking fee's and a lot of time. I was fortunate to get a decent convention rate, outside the convention rate this hotel was quite expensive. The rate would have likely turned me to look at one of the other Hilton properties but in the end I was more than pleased with my stay and would certainly suggest you consider it. The onsite restaurant had a great dinner menu (pub style though), service was fast and the food was very good. I actually returned more out of interest to try other things on the menu then out of necessity.

The hotel is a nice size and has a nice workout facility. But what I can't STAND is the overpriced eating options. I stay at a LOT of hotels, but this one doesn't provide a single meal (breakfast, lunch, or dinner) option for under $10. I had a burger in the bar during one stay, it was $16. That was with a 20% discount! Room service charges the 15% service fee as expected, but then there is an ADDITIONAL 3% administrative fee AND $3.50 room service charge. Continental breakfast will run you $20, that's for a muffin/pastry choice, juice option and coffee/tea option?!? What really bothered me on my stay here last night was 1) the toilet paper dispenser is in an inconvenient location and then, it didn't spin! You try to pull some, and it just tore because the roll stayed still. I had to wrestle the roll of the spinner and just spin it in my hands to use it. The facial tissue dispenser had 3 white tissues before they turned orange to let me know they were all gone. Great! Especially when you're coming down with a cold. Why they can't put a full one in during housekeeping cleaning time makes no sense, or keep a spare in the bathroom like some hotels do with the toilet paper rolls. I also couldn't fall asleep for 3 hours. If you're a side sleeper, you will not like the pillows at all! I also had to unplug that alarm clock, cause that orange glow wasn't making things any easier.

The food and drink offerings are not as generous as some HHonors lounges, but it is still possible to consume a serious number of calories! We used the indoor swimming pool once, but I found it awkward to walk through the lobby in my swimming attire (the only way to get to the pool). This placement was not the greatest design decision the architects ever made. While the hotel does has a shuttle to the airport, it is possible to walk to at least Terminal C via some enclosed walkways and then through one of the central parking garages. After more than half a dozen stays, we have \"cracked the code\" and walk each time to our concourse. We are very comfortable at this hotel and find it's a good way to start a trip the next morning.", "Date": "October 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Parker CO", "Title": "\u201cWhat comfort and convenience!\u201d", "Author": "Samlud", "ReviewID": "UR83400175", "Content": "We stayed overnight here on our way back from Norway.

My family and I were treated as valued guests from the moment Souad greeted us at the reception desk until Shirley checked us out and inquired about the stay. I had just earned my Hilton Diamond status so was upgraded to an incredible room. The views were nothing short of magnificant. We had views of both Boston Harbor and the airport. As we are airport and airplane aficionados, we found ourselves easily entranced by the views. We stayed up for hours eyeing takeoffs and landings as well as enjoying the sunset views of the harbor and downtown. If you enjoy great views, this is definitely the hotel for you - whether or not you plan to use the airport. I can think of no better location in Boston for views of the city and harbor. The hotel is easily accessible to downtown via the \"T\" (1 or 2 stops from hotel to downtown). It is also attached to airport terminal walkways. This allowed us to casually stroll over to the terminal when we were ready to board our flight. The rooms were attractively furnished in modern style and all the top notch amenities one expects from a Hilton were available. The beds were amazingly comfortable - I slept like a baby. There were also plenty of mirrors scattered throughout the room which I appreciated. I also noticed padded trays which I believe were meant to be used for laptop computers (we were on vacation so left ours at home). The flat screen TV worked beautifully and more than enough channels were available for viewing. I was upgraded to the Executive Lounge and enjoyed the views from there as well. We did not dine in the restaurant so I can't comment about it, although we received a treat from room service (provided by Leon who graciously served us) which was delicious. We also enjoyed the turn down service provided by one of the housekeepers whose name I regret to say I've forgotten as she was terrific as well. When we departed the next morning, we passed by a housekeeper who came out of the room she was cleaning to greet us and ask if we had an enjoyable stay. Throughout our visit we received smiles and greetings from all staff we encountered. We felt pampered throughout the stay and can't wait to return. Whenever we make future plans to stay in Boston, we will stay nowhere else but the Hilton Boston Logan Airport.

We had an early morning departure from Logan and decided to burn some HH points for this stay. Check-in was very quick/efficient and as a HH Gold I was upgraded to the 10th floor with lounge access. The rooms have recently been upgraded and are up the best Hilton standards. One of the best features is the executive lounge on the 10th floor which offers breathtaking views of the Boston skyline along with snacks and drinks. The only complaint would be the expensive alcoholic beverages ... they used to be $6, now they are > $10 and it feels like they are trying to make a serious profit on it.

You are better off taking the shuttle which I ended up doing since the walkways with signs to get to the airport end at the lobby of the garage. Everyone is vague about how to get to the walkways other than point you through the garage. Fortunately, a shuttle was crusiing the garage to pick up passengers so I got a lift. The driver himself admitted that the 'walk' is not really user friendly. Once you get to the terminal via shuttle that leaves you at another garage, it is another hike to get to the actual airline terminal. My opinion is that if you are paying premium (even with the AAA discount, I ended up paying almost 200.00 with tax for one night) , you should be able to just walk over to the airport at your leisure.

Easy walk to the hotel from our terminal (especially for me since my husband carried the heavy bags...). Check in was the fastest I've ever experienced. Pretty, clean hotel and room; comfortable bed. Only complaint is I felt as though we could hear every conversation and door closing, all night. And with the airport location - understandably - you have guests arriving at all hours. I generally sleep like a rock and am not overly sensitive to sounds, so I have to think the rooms are not all that sound-proofed. Although I did not hear anything in the way of airplanes, just people, so who knows? We did also have 1 really loud couple talking and laughing in the wee hours. Couldn't quite tell where it was coming from, didn't complain; certainly not the hotel's fault. We were there so briefly we did not try the in-room internet nor did we eat there. The walk back to the airport the next morning to the terminal to catch a car rental pick-up shuttle was a breeze. (Again, with hubby toting the big bags; it is a bit of a walk. There is an option to take a hotel shuttle that I would probably take next time if by myself with several bags.) Definitely ask questions as to where the hotel is in relation to your terminal because it is close to 1, reasonably close to another and it looked like kind of a haul to walk from the rest. Overall, I would stay there again for 1 night under similar circumstances: Either flying in late to Boston, or driving in to Boston to fly out early the next morning. This hotel is perfect for having that convenience. I would not stay here more than 1 night as it is on the expensive side, is not as close to the Boston attractions as I'd prefer, and I did not sleep well because of the people/door (although NOT airplane) noise.", "Date": "August 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "DeLand, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hilton - convenience to airport invaluable\u201d", "Author": "GatorNana", "ReviewID": "UR37768732", "Content": "The valet and check-in experiences were flawless.

TIP - there are to the left as you enter the lobby all the way over by the fitness room and gift shop hidden around the corner. I snagged one and took it out the the car. Still no one around to greet or help out. When I had lifted the last bag onto the cart a man appeared in uniform almost demanding to help out finally. I told him that since there was no one to greet or help us that he was too late ( and by implication too late to get a tip). While my S.O. waited in the lobby for check in time and while I returned the car to Dollar (great experience BTW) she was asked/told at least twice to be sure to return the cart to the lobby.

The room was good, not great as you would expect, but good. No fitted sheet on the king bed but only a flat sheet folded around the mattress.

The room was unremarkable, except that it had a very good flat screen TV. We heard no jet or air conditioner noise, but sleep was difficult because there was poor sound insulation in the walls. We heard our guest neighbors speaking normally, moving heavy objects, and closing doors far into the night and early the next morning. Next morning: Berkshire's restaurant offered a breakfast buffet - for $24 per person. So we ordered off the menu and the waitress wrote the order down. Waited a long time. Breakfast came with scrambled eggs instead of over medium as I'd ordered. Sent it back. Waited. Eventually she got it right, although I had to ask again for the jelly. $19 per person. I will say the bacon was superb. The next morning we ate breakfast at the Starbuck's Cafe in the lobby and found the counter person helpful and the food satisfactory, though somewhat overpriced.

I only ate one breakfast in the hotel restaurant, but the service there was fast and efficient. There are a number of healthy choices on the menu, although like most hotel restaurants, everything is a little pricey. Perhaps the only downside of this hotel is that there is nothing else around it except the airport. But if you want to explore some of Boston's restaurants, you can take the hotel shuttle to the Airport Station of Boston's mass transit system and be in Chinatown or Little Italy in twenty minutes. The shuttle bus can also take you to the car rental locations by the airport.

For plane spotters the view from upper floors towards the airport is great -with the bonus of effective soundproofing. There are free computers in the lobby. As it was the weekend the honors lounge is actually closed so I was given as voucher to the restaurant for a hot breakfast. Breakfast was good- plenty of choice-all very nice. Before checking out I looked at my reservation and realised the room type allocated to me was really a downgrade from the larger corner room I had actually booked . I queried this at checkout and had my bill reduced accordingly ,although the argumentative clerk insisted that the rooms were \"nearly\" the same despite the room descriptions on the website- I find this hard to believe-it all seems rather deceitful.

Physically connected to Terminals A and E, the hotel also offers a courtesy shuttle, which also drops and picks up at the T subway station for the city. I used Hilton's online check in system so I knew I had an upgraded room. Arriving at check in there was a lengthy line, but the Hhonors line was clear so I joined that, only to be consistently ignored by staff and barged out of the way by non-Hhonors members. I got zero benefit from using online check in or the Hhonors priority line, so I have to ask what the benefit of these services are if a hotel ignores them... But that was the only flaw with the stay. The rooms in the Hilton are nice. All have views, some of the airport which is surprisingly interesting, and on this occasion for, a view across the airport to the city sklyine. A great vantage point for the firework display, enhanced by the presence of the Queen Mary 2 in the harbour. Rooms are clean, bathrooms good, and the new flatscreen TV's are very good.

It is adjacent to the terminals and has an enclosed bridge that takes you to the central parking lot. From there, you can walk or take airport's parking lot shuttle (the drivers are not allowed to accept tips, btw) to any of the terminals. There is also a Hilton shuttle from the hotel to each terminal. While overnight parking is available at the hotel, the central garage is enclosed, important in the winter, and cheaper ($24 vs. $30 a night at the Hilton), and I'm sure long-term parking is even less. So, we parked our car in the central garage for the five days we were away. We saved some money and the car was right outside the door to the terminal. The lobby is grand and check-in was efficient. The very pleasant desk clerk invited us to use the concierge-level lounge for snacks that evening and for a continental breakfast the following morning. There is no alcohol served in that lounge. Breakfast was very good -- fruit, cereal, coffee/tea, juice, bagels, muffins -- enough to get you going before your flight. Our room was a good size and very quiet. Beds are comfy and the bathroom, stocked with Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries, was spotless, as was the main part of the room. The shower had great water pressure. There was a coffee maker in the room. We did not use the workout area or the spa, which offered a variety of treatments. Check-out was a breeze and the clerk on in the morning was as pleasant as the one the night before. Two things keep me from giving the excellent rating -- a charge for Internet service, which should be free, considering many businesspeople use this hotel, and some knocking noises that were hard to determine as to origin, and lasted for about five minutes. I've also stayed at the Hyatt, the equivalent of a few blocks away but still on airport property.

We booked an Exec Level room (10th floor) for $199 plus various taxes. The 10th floor has certainly had a re-fit with new furniture and decorations. Overall the scheme is very pleasing. With the exec level you get access to the lounge with free continental breakfast and hot snacks in the evening. Note: there are no free alcoholic drinks due to Massachusetts state law. Pros: its an easy 5 min walk to termial A to catch the silver line downtown (about a 10 min journey) and a 10 min walk to terminal E. The shuttle runs fequently if you cannot be bothered to walk or if you want to go to the blue line subway. Cons: We've stayed at this hotel about 5 times and it is a very nice hotel but we felt this experience was a little disappointing. Check in wasn't until 4.00pm and although we'd arrived after an international flight (at 2pm) not one room was ready...even the baggage man was surprised that we had to wait when we checked our bags for the wait. I think this is something they could address quite easily but no one on reception was bothered. When we did check in there was no apology for the lengthy wait (3 hours). The rooms are spacious and comfortable - no complaints. There is no noise from the airport and our neighbours were quiet so no disturbing noise from them either. Housekeeping was a bit hit and miss - dust was clearly visible when we arrived but it gradually disappeared dueing the stay. Bedding and towels changed everyday. The bed is VERY comfortable... The exec lounge is a nice facility but the breakfast NEVER changes - cereals, fruit, bagels/muffins/pastries and cold boiled eggs. Is it really too much to expect a little variation? It wouldn't cost THAT much to put some hot eggs and bacon on the menu - even a Hilton Hampton Inn can manage that. That said, its fresh and good quality so if you are only staying 1 or 2 nights then you'll be OK. Anything longer will send you out looking for alternatives. Staff are polite but a little remote - no complaints.

Once reaching the room, we did have a few minor issues, but ones that I wouldn't have expected when staying at a four star hotel. The television didn't work for starters and it took two calls to housekeeping to get it fixed. Within about 2 hours, the toilet was clogged, and again, it took two calls to housekeeping to get them up to fix it. While fixing the toilet, the guy splashed water all over the floor, and left it there for me to clean up. Not something I wanted to do, but did anyway. Both times, we waited about 30 minutes before making the second call. We also had to call down to get a key for the mini-bar... ours was missing. After spending the afternoon in Boston, the shuttle picked us up at the train station (very timely here) and the adults in our party decided to go down to the lounge for a drink. I wanted to order a take out salad for one of my children, but it was against hotel policy, so we were stuck ordering room service instead. Room service was fairly quick. We ordered the fruit plate (the fruit was very good), but the cup of yogurt had a huge hole poked through the top of it, and it looked like someone had already eaten out of it! We called about that, and they brought rasberry sorbet instead. Most of these issues are small, I agree, but when given the choice of staying at a 3 or 4 star hotel, in my mind, these things are what seperate the two.

In a nutshell, this Hilton-franchised property may be on the spendy side, but on balance it's worth the price paid. This Hilton has recently undergone a change in ownership, and as a result the hotel has undergone some cosmetic improvements including new bedding, new carpeting in the rooms and common areas, and new tile and fixtures in the bath. The result is that the hotel is in almost new shape and is exceptionally clean and well-maintained. Our room was on the 10th (highest) floor; rooms at the ends of the hallways are quite a walk from the centrally located elevators. This Hilton does have a lounge on the 10th floor. HVAC worked well, bedding was exceptionally comfortable, and linens and towels were spotlessly clean. The hotel recently equipped its rooms with large, LCD flat-panel hi-definition televisions with digital sound. The hotel has the best location at Boston Logan and two recently-opened sky bridges connect the hotel directly to the International Terminal and to Delta Airline's new terminal. We have stayed at this property a number of times over the past few years, both on business trips and vacations. When on business we actually prefer staying at this Hilton property, either using a cab or the nearby water taxi to get into the downtown core. We were pleased to find a number of bell and front desk staff still at the hotel since our last visit in October. The staff is generally very, very helpful and eager to please. As an example, my wife and I had a number of perishable items that had to be kept cooled/frozen. Aside from a mini-bar, the rooms do not have mini-fridges. to our amazement, within five minutes of calling the guest services line, a mini-fridge was delivered and set up in our room at no charge. Additional \"added-value\" touches include that the hotel's shuttle van will deliver you to or pick you up from any of the nearby car rental centers, again at no cost. This level of service is extraordinary in our view. Others have mentioned here that the hotel imposes many charges on guests. It's true that parking can run $35 per night and that internet access runs about $10 a day. Food - especially room service - is similarly very expensive. We didn't havea car to park, we used the business center internet-equipped computers that can be rented on an hourly basis, and frankly the food we ordered was delicious (especially the clam chowder!!).

Everything about this place is nice and new! It has a beautiful, huge lobby and at the end of the hallway on each floor are two chairs/table that you can sit and look out into the Boston Harbor - very nice. 2. The furnishings and decor in the rooms are top-notch. There is even a huge LCD HDTV in the room - and you get HD programming. 3. If you want to be by the airport, you're there! There is a shuttle that can take you from the airport to your terminal, which is what I did. I think you can walk from the hotel to the airport, but the agent told me to take the shuttle and it was very convenient/quick. 4. Since my flight was cancelled and I had a rental car, I had no way to get to the hotel from the rental car place. I called the hotel and they picked me up in 5 mins! 5. The food/service in the restaurant was great and not over-priced. Cons: 1. Half the channels on the huge LCD HDTV I mentioned above didn't work. 2. The sound insulation in the rooms is not good - I could hear people coughing in the room next door and could hear people in the hallway outside my room very clearly. 3. Again, the location is great if you want to be by the airport, which I did. If you want to walk the freedom trail, go to a game at fenway or eat in the North End, you are not in the city and you won't be able to walk to them.

The only problem is being the hotel is quite spread out and the ends of the hotel are a good couple of minutes walk from the elevators! You can't have everything though! After some confusion regarding access to the Executive Lounge we went to the room itself, nice and spacious, billed as a Deluxe Room it was quite a bit bigger than the room I'd previously had on the Executive Floor. The view was great too! Room had a flatscreen HDTV which made watching some late night TV a bit more pleasurable too. We spent the rest of the evening itself in the Executive Lounge (open to all HH Golds & Diamonds plus Exec Floor folks regardless of booking method). We'd just missed the evening hors d'oeuvres but watched a couple of shows with some drinks, enjoying the views of the city. The staff came over to have a word with my wife and I and were very friendly, informing us of the weather tomorrow, inviting us to check-in for our flight using the computers etc etc. For those of you contemplating paying for an Exec Floor room do it! This is one of the best Exec Lounges in any Hilton I've come across. In terms of facilities it is comparable to a half decent airline lounge. We slept very well, as I do with all Hilton beds and breakfast the following morning in the Exec Lounge was quitre sufficient to tie me over with an early bite to eat before getting breakfast on our flight. I'd say unless you aren't fussy about what you eat you'll struggle to get a decent breakfast on the top floor lounge and getting breakfast downstairs must be better. That said I've had early flights both times when staying here so can't comment on it. Overall still one of my favourite hotels in the Hilton Family and excellent for an airport hotel.

Rooms: we requested 2 adjoining rooms(there were 7 of us), each with 2 double beds, and thats exaclty what we got. the rooms were clean and cozy, and bathrooms were nice as well. I forgot to bring a toothbrush, so i called guest services, and one was brought up for me in a few minutes. being physically located AT the airport, one would be concerned with the noise, but that proved to not be an issue. the only noise was from the HVAC. the negatives included an HVAC system that needed to work better. it was hard keeping the room at a constant temp level, it would consistently go from too warm, to too cold, and could be a bit noisy. the rooms were a tad on the smaller side, but was not really a problem. we had a nice view of the airport from the room, and plenty of sunlight through the full floor to ceiling window. ammenities/services: shuttle service - after reading a couple reviews on how it was unreliable...i was a bit hesitant. but we used it to get to the T and at no time did we have to wait more than 5 min (either going to or coming back) for the shuttle to arrive. in fact, on 2 occasions (4 total trips), the shuttle was actually waiting for us. heck, we even used it after we checked out! =) pool/fitness center - the gym was very clean and had sufficient equipment. even each treadmill had individual monitors for you to watch as you worked out. we were offered lockers (for FREE), so we used it. towels were plentiful (i used 5 myself), for the pool and gym. the pool was nice, not too large or small. and the area was again, very clean. the hot tub was a TAD too hot, but not a big deal. locker rooms were nice and clean, and the showers were stocked with body wash and shampoo. Connely's pub - we grabbed some late nite appetizers and drinks at the hotel pub, and it was just great. i was very impressed with the wings and the prices were reasonable. service was fine and it had a great atmosphere. OK, the only REAL negative about this hotel, was the price for parking. we parked for 2 nites, 2 cars, it was $52 per car. $26/ nite to park, so we paid a total of $104 just for parking, which is a little over the top in my book. oh yea, and housekeeping did not empty out the ice bucket for us, and didnt restock the coffee supply. again, not a big deal.

Check-in was even easier as we checked in and received our room assignment on-line; from the time we walked through the front door to crossing the threshold of our room, not more than five minutes passed. Rooms - even rooms at the end of hallways/corner rooms are fairly small, more in line with what one would find in a newer European Hilton. Rooms are well furnished and our king bed had a wonderful duvet. On the negative side, the room HVAC air-flow is minimal and cooling the room took longer than expected. Our problem with this property is that aside from the fairly steep room rates, everything at this hotel is designed to extract additional fees and costs from guests. Let's start with overnight parking: US$30 (plus tips every time to arrive/depart). Want to have internet access? That will be at least US$10. You've paid the additional cost of upgrading to the Executive Floor so you will have access to the lounge. In Europe, breakfasts, snacks, and evening treats are all complimentary together with beer, wine, and all spirits. Free. No cost. Included in the cost of paying for a room on the Executive Floor. Oh, no. But not at this Hilton. My wife was billed for more than US$10 for a single (small) glass of a routine Merlot. I could go on and on, but by now you have the idea.

For the first three nights, we booked our room through Priceline, for $65 a night. I would consider that one of my best deals through Priceline ever. On the way back, I paid $145 through Hilton's [--] website, and I still felt the price was fair (but glad I only had to pay one night at that rate!). Visiting a city has never been more convenient. No worrying about taxis, Super Shuttles, or public transportation with luggage. We called them on the courtesty phone at baggage claim, and they were there in 4 minutes. We had many opportunities to use the shuttle to the subway stop, rental car place, etc., and never had to wait more than 5 minutes. They essentially run continuously. They even took us directly to and from the rental car location (we didn't have to switch to the rental car shuttle in the airport). It's only a few subway stops to most of the tourist spots in Boston--you're there in minutes. The rooms, while not huge, were comfortable, attractive, and, above all, absolutely quiet. My room faced the airport both times (I incorrectly thought I would get a Boston skyline view on my return stay), and I never heard a decibel from the airport, or from other guests for that matter. Since I'm a HHonors Gold member, we received a top (executive/10th) floor room both times, and the water pressure, while not gushing was fine. The gym, sauna, steam room, indoor pool and hot tub were all in perfect order with an attendant on hand at all times and a towel service.

Alternately, the hotel is attached by skybridge to Terminal E - other terminals require a short walk. Lobby sits in the rear of a spacious atrium - check-in went smoothly. There is 24 hour room service and two restaurants in the lobby area that cover most of the daytime hours. The breakfast restaurant gives you the option of buffet-style or order-from-menu. Food is good and plentiful. The health club is spacious and contains workout appartus, locker rooms, television sets, a indoor heated lap pool (about 15 yards long) and a large jacuzzi. Service in the bedrooms is prompt and excellent. There is a coffee maker and a newspaper is delivered to your room each weekday morning. On weekends you can go to the gift shop in the lobby (after 7am) to buy a newspaper. The hotel shuttle will take you to the local subway (Airport) station - called the 'T' in Boston. For $18 you get a three day pass good on all city transport services. If you don't mind walking you can take the skybridge to Terminal E - go down to the surface level and catch an airport bus to the 'T'.

The staff was friendly, responsive and courteous- we were not on the executive level but they brought us very comfy robes to lounge in at our request. After returning from the spa we ordered room service and a movie- the food was excellent (I had the scrod which was really delightful and my husband had the chicken florentine).

In addition to being a very nice hotel, there was a substantial savings, compared to staying right in the city. This is a fair trade-off for the need to take a taxi, water taxi (you can figure about $20 for two people on either of those two option as a ballpark estimate) -- or the \"T\" into town. A nice feature of the hotel is that in addition to the hotel's courtesy shuttle, visitors have the option of walking over on a skybridge that connects the Hilton to the terminal (we flew on Northwest, using Terminal E, but there are connections to other terminals, too.) The hotel itself is impressively appointed, with a large lobby, well-maintained common areas, a pub that serves a decent menu (including room service). There is also a more formal full-service restaurant on the property. The 10th floor executive level has a nice lounge area with long hours (5:30 a.m. until 11 p.m. on weekdays). In addition to the usual morning continental breakfast items and before dinner snacks, we made use of a single computer that is available for the complimentary use of lounge guests, (though it obviously gets plenty of activity and it is a first-come, first-served type of thing.) There is a first floor fitness center with a good selection of weights and equipment, as well as a swimming pool and hot tub. All are kept in great condition and the hotel itself is immaculate. There were no traffic jams at the elevators during our stay at any time. We never heard an aircraft during our stay, so the building is obviously well sound-proofed. Size-wise, we would put the guest rooms on the average to even slightly smaller than average size, but they are well-furnished and maintained. Beds get well above average marks from us for comfort. Towels were plush and robes were provided on the executive level, too. The bathroom was plenty roomy enough and immaculate.

The equipment in the gym was top of the line, varied and nicely laid out with televison viewing. Massage was available. The locker room was equal to that of a memebership gym.
