The rooms were small and dark but I got an outside room so I am guessing the inside rooms were smaller and darker. I would expect a lot higher standard for the price we were paying. The receptionists while not un-helpful were not efficient and took forever to do the smallest task. Travelling for business I need receipts and it should not be so difficult to provide them. The hotel had organised for transfer from Airport to hotel, which was overpriced and double booked and I had to wait for-ever at the airport for him to pick up the other passenger who was not even going to the same hotel. When I complained to reception there was a lot of shrugging.

I would not have picked this one based on Trip Advisor reviews - which I have to say were by and large correct. While we were lucky in getting a room designed for wheelchair access - and threfore ok size-wise, others were not so lucky. One person had to move room three times, as the heating wouldn't work in two rooms and the electricity in the other! Our room was ok, but the bathroom, while big, was designed for wheelchair users so this resulted in the mirror being put too low for normal use, so we had to practically kneel to use it - simple solution would be a bigger mirror! Also the shower area had a two-inch drop into it, which was a potential death trap, as it was positioned right where you step to access teh towels. The 'spa' facilities were skimpy to say the least, - the 'gym' was a treadmill and an exercise machine! The pool is tiny. They are overpriced - $10 an hour for a sauna is top whack for a poor facility, especially as it takes at least 10 minutes to warm up. We were warned that the area wasn't very good, but had no problems in that regard - some of the group explored it at night and had no problems. We ate in teh hotel - breakfast very good - dinner ok. We would not have had dinner except for the fact that it was part of the package. Watch out for taxi rip-offs. It generally cost twice as much to get back from the city centre as it did to get there - maybe because the hotel staff would get us taxis to go downtown, while we just picked them up in the street on the way back and generally got the scenic tour home!", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Subotica", "Title": "\u201cSome details missing...\u201d", "Author": "Chaboo", "ReviewID": "UR100619683", "Content": "I liked Istanbul but next time sure will not go back to this hotel.

Rooms: size was large enough and arranged well. We found that there are 2 types of rooms. Some rooms face an internal narrow space that provided uncomfortable feeling and no air. Other face the street, with look to the Bosporus. We asked and moved to the Bosporus side, which was big and with nice view. If you stay in this hotel, demand only upper floors with windows to the Bosporus! There is some constant noise from the main street at all time. It was OK for us, but maybe a problem to sensitive people. Staff: All was very polite, trying to help and please. Location: Old city, 5 minutes walk to tram station, train station and busses. We never took taxi, just public transportation. There are also lots of places to eat close by, even in late hours. It was cheap, clean and tasty.
