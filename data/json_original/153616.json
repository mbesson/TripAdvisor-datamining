We did not like the first room (48) and got another (15) the next day. Good service, good breakfast, nice people. Other guests nice people, no noisy all inclusive crap. Most important: the absolute unique experience of having a room in the middle of a beautiful botanic garden, steps from the beach or on it, with your own veranda and hammocks. Rooms are a bit dated but well cleaned and everything's there. Absolute great value for money. No tv, hooray. Location of the hotel is good: Best beach of Playa, quiet end of Av Quinta.

The property is lovely. There was a mistake with our room upon check-in so Mariela upgraded us from a Garden View lower-level room to an individual bungalow on the beach. Please do yourself a favor and spend the extra money and stay on the beach! The room was just stunning and we were literally steps from the water. After spending the day on the beach, we relaxed in our hammocks listening to the ocean waves roll in as the sun set. Then, we'd hit-up la Quinta Avenida, also just behind the property. Perhaps the best discovery we made was the actual beach itself. If you walk south of the pier, the beach turns to total crap. Mucky water rolls up onto the sandbag-lined shore. The water is either infested with rocks or tied-up fishing boats. But, our beach was perfect. It was wide enough to accommodate hotel guests and the public and the water was rock and muck free! Plus, this section of sand attracts a lot of Italians. You couldn't ask for better sight seeing. Some people have complained about the noise coming from Mamitas, but we hardly noticed it. It's a bit louder during the day on Saturdays, but that gives the atmosphere a lively vibe. They turn off the music at night and all you can hear is the sound of the ocean throughout the resort. All in all, this was a great stay.

Mariela, in Reservations, gave us a special rate after contacting her as the rates had gone up since our visit last year. The location at the north end of Playa with a beautiful shady beach (or sun) is perfect and there is a bar for food and drink within steps. The drive down into the hotel gives an idea of what's ahead and the grounds of the hotel are something--the park area leading to the beach is gorgeous. As is the Casa Club where you can drink and dine in the evening. I totally love the palapa roofs over the personal patio area where you have chairs and hammocks. Everything is laid back and pleasant--no frantic music here (tho you can hear pounding music from Mamita's Dance bar in the evening.) One afternoon, there was a wonderful flute player at the beach bar. Close by on 5th Avenue are some non-touristy dining spots--or you can walk to the busier areas. (Try the Cuban restaurant. Also, the great bakery on the corner.) Probably one of the most amazing things about this trip was the fact that Juan, who serves breakfast, recognized us and called us by name--and our last visit was nearly l4 months ago!

The hotel restaurant was romatic (if you take the beach table) and it had decent options. The room was its own hut which was romatic.

We are a young couple and are willing to put up with some things, but it was too much to handle. We asked for a refund and moved to a different hotel after one night.

And I don't mean just in the background, but to the point where we had to talk loudly to one another in our rooms to speak over the monotonous beat. Ear plugs at night couldn't drown the music. It was a major headache and affected the quality of the vacation in a HUGE way. Given the size of the event and the promotion involved one must assume that there was more than enough time to forewarn the guests so that they could have made other plans. As it was, the only notice we received was in the form of a circular distributed on the afternoon of the 26th. AFTER the techno music was playing ALL DAY and ALL NIGHT. The food was some of the worst we have ever had. BAD cruise ship type of food. No fresh juices for juice or drinks...Speaking of drinks, stay away, awful, with fake ingredients. Just plain bad. Las Palapas rents out their beach front lounge chairs to day pass people off the beach. By the time we got down to the beach at around 9:30 AM ALL of the front chairs were taken TO DAY PASS GUESTS, they don't care for or save the good chairs for their guests. Awful.

Finally, they moved us to a temporary room untill our original rooms AC could be fixed. That left us feeling unsettled and uncertain as to what was going to happen. The AC was fixed about 30 hours later and we were moved back to our original room. We felt like we lost a day of our vacation. We had an issue with our room on the previous stay also and had to be moved. Since changing ownership the hotel is going through some growing pains. They have improved the look and feel a bit, but raised the drink prices and reduced the quality. Beers are all cans now and the cocktails are mostly mixes. The breakfast is always excellent, the rest of the food is mediocre at best. For the price you can stay at one of the All Inclusive hotels in town, but we prefer the old Mexico feel and being on the north end of PDC. In this case I think you are actually paying more for less. We wish some of the old Las Palapas would come back (mostly drinks) and the rooms would be improved a bit at this price point.

Last year the staff and customer service could not be faulted. However, this year was a different story. There had been a mix up with our booking in that we had booked an extra day's stay through travel republic but had got the date wrong. The hotel harassed us almost every day for confirmation of the date change from our holiday provider. This should have been straight forward as the night had been paid for already and a simple date change on their computer should have been enough. We were continually harassed which caused stress and anxiety for the entire stay until it was eventually sorted. We were there for eight days, already paid for but every time we passed reception we were harassed. There were also notes on our door. It caused friction between my partner and I and ruined our stay. Also, we had booked a trip to Tulum where we needed a wake up call at 6.30am, as neither of us had taken our mobiles on holiday and had no alarm system. The wake up call never came. By sheer chance I woke up ten minutes before we had to leave and we had to run to get to the pick up point. When we told reception, no apology. On our last day we paid for and arranged a transfer to the airport at 11am. 11.20am passed and no taxi, so we asked reception...it had never been arranged and had to wait another 15minutes on one being sent out, so we were half an hour late at the airport.

We are a couple in our thirties and this was our 5th trip to Mexico, Playa del Carmen. We have stayed in a few Rius and at the Royal PdC and wanted to stay at a hotel that is not AI. The location is perfect, just a few steps away from La Quinta and nowadays there's a lot going on at the north end of 5th. Lots of shops and restaurants of all kinds. The rooms are different from each other I guess. Prior to our trip I saw photos of some fresh, bohemian style rooms and our room was nothing like that. It was a very basic room, not very fancy but functionally it was fine, not very pretty though. You could have a small fridge delivered to your room, can't remember how much it cost but it was not expensive. Bed and mattress were good. The shower was ok but could use a better lighting. We were on the first floor and the terrace was really nice to sit in the evening. The wifi doesn't work really, neither does the connection the reception's computers. The beach was lovely, good to swim. There was a beach bar where you can get drinks and food. Drinks were good but the food was just ok. And the food was overpriced, at the beach bar and the actual restaurant. Also I had a bit of trouble finding anything to eat during the day, there were no proper salads. At day time I don't want to eat anything heavy and wanted salad but the caesar salad was basically maybe 4 big leaves of lettuce and some salad dressing... make it a bit more appealing please! Tacos al pastor were good. In the end for lunch we decided to get pizza slices from 5th Ave, near the hotel, they were a total bargain and very, very good quality! The breakfast buffet was awesome at the hotel, very good food! You could have an omelette cooked the way you prefer, bacon, yoghurt and fruit etc. The music from Mamitas beach club is pretty loud considering it's not right next to this property. It didn't really bother me but I was I knew about it before I went. To our room it sounded just like a monotonic bass going on and on. I think there's nothing you can do and if you are going high season the hotel is most likely to be full and you cannot be moved to a quieter location. But the music is not so loud that you couldn't hear anything else, you can hear the birds etc still. The birds will wake you up in the morning, but I thought that was really nice. We had one unpleasant incident. Our room was at the back of the jungle side, far away from the beach. Behind our room there was a shed where some maintenance equipment etc was stocked and to the shed there was a similar path than elsewhere in the property. Our room had one window facing the shed but there are some trees and other plants in front so that you cannot see straight to the room from the shed. One morning I was in our room and my boyfriend was in the shower. I was in my bikini getting ready to go to the beach when I saw something moving in the window facing the shed. There was a man standing behind the window, he had come through the plants and trees area and was literally in our window peeping in! I saw that this guy was mexican based on the haircut and the shape of his face. I ran to the bathroom to tell my boyfriend but the man noticed I noticed him and had already gone when we went out. We went to the reception to tell about the incident. The german (?) receptionist listened and said: mexican men are pretty eager to see european women! We asked if we could be moved because I was now afraid of going in to the room but ofcourse there was nothing they could offer. They said they would increase security but it surely didn't take away my fear. I don't know if he was peeping in to see a naked european woman or to see if there was something to steal I didn't enjoy the next week we stayed at the room. And even though the receptionist was pretty nice to me when I told her this there was no apologies or anything made. This is now the only reason I would not return, unfortunately. If I owned a hotel I would've maybe offered a percentage of discount on the tab we had (you have it to your room and pay when you leave the resort) or sent a bottle of bubbly to our room to make it clear that the hotel is sorry for the inconvenience. To sum up, all the rooms are not fancy but still ok and the location is perfect. Beach is good and people working there are nice. Mostly europeans. For us the incident surely ruined our stay, it could have been worse but it was enough to make us unfomfortable.", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago IL", "Title": "\u201cThe Perfect Destination Wedding\u201d", "Author": "skyhawkd", "ReviewID": "UR117879954", "Content": "We got married on the beach at Las Palapas and enjoyed staying 6 days at Las Palapas.

However, the review was written before I saw my credit card statement and realized I had been overcharged. We were charged more per night than the room rate than our travel agent confirmed months previously. (I think the room rate quote was based on us paying in cash (?). But we were never informed that we needed to pay in cash to get the quoted room rate!?!?!) The exchange rate that was specifically quoted at check out by the receptionist was NOT the exchange rate we actually received. I had clarified the exchange rate with the receptionist and double checked everything at check out...I thought. Wrong....when I returned home and checked my credit card, the charges were $100 more than I was told they would be. I emailed with Las Palapas from March 2011- August 2011 and they still have not corrected the charge. I enjoyed my stay there greatly but I warn all fellow travelers to check your credit card charges before you leave so you can correct anything there in person. I can see that other travelers have had this same issue. It is very unfortunate that Las Palapas has not corrected the issue. Everything about Las Palapas Hotel itself is wonderful. We loved the breakfast buffet. I loved hearing the ocean, the wind and the animal/bird noises every morning. The beach location is superb. The rooms were comfortable and quiet at night and in the morning. The service and food from the beach bar were surprisingly really good! The grounds of Las Palapas are beautiful, so many plants, trees, animals. We really enjoyed our stay there. However, we went on vacation to relax, lay by the beach, read books, and just hang out and the Mamitas Beach Club music significantly interfered with all of those plans...So I am sad to say I would not return for one important reason: the afternoon noise from the Mamitas Beach Club next door. It's really unfortunate how far the Mamitas music travels and how it negatively affects Las Palapas. Mamitas is actually separated from Las Palapas by a huge jungle/lot but the sound is just too loud. I love club music but not very loud music for 6 hours a day. The intensity of the music/noise from Mamitas really varies around Las Palapas which is why some TripAdvisor reviewers don't mention it and others do. In some areas, like the beach and the side of the property bordering the Mahekal resort, the music is less noticable, which is great for the guests who happen to have rooms that are in that area. For example, in the beach houses, the sound of the waves mostly drowns out the music which is great. And when you are on the beach itself, you barely hear the music because the sounds of the ocean. But for the majority of rooms, you can definitely hear the Mamitas afternoon music. We spent all our afternoon time on the beach even when we didn't really want to be there so we could avoid hearing the loud music. As soon as you walk into the Las Palapas property and reach the Casa Club/pool area, you start to hear a loud bass beat and you can't escape from it anywhere on the resort property! For the majority of the rooms you can hear a steady loud bass beat from about 1 p.m - 7 p.m. each day. So relaxing quietly in the hammock and reading, or taking a nap in your room, is not be possible in the afternoon. You pay for a wonderful room that you have to avoid 25 % of the time because of another resort's noise. So if relaxing at your hotel and in your palapa are important for your vacation, I would proceed with caution. If you are going to be out every afternoon, in town, or doing other tourist type tours, the Mamitas noise probably won't be an issue for you. Also, although they advertise WiFi, the wireless only worked about 30 minutes total out of our 7 day stay. On the hotel lobby computers, the internet did work about 50 % of the time. Las Palapas is a mostly wonderful resort, but the Mamitas music is unfortunately an issue. I would recommend it to a friend but only after explaining the music situation to them. So although the hotel amenities make this a \"very good\" hotel in rating, the music situation is a significant daily annoyance that brings the rating down to \"average\".", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mexico City, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cA great discovery! / Fantastische Entdeckung!\u201d", "Author": "Lobagola", "ReviewID": "UR115739240", "Content": "This was our first visit to Playa del Carmen, the place has been highly recommended by my sister, then by my niece, and in a sudden by everyone we know and asked about Playa.

We always have preferred one near the beach, we then performed a search and found \"Las Palapas\", it looked confortable, a few steps from the beach, nothing to do with those big ostentatious buildings that proliferate these days in every touristic destination. \"Las Palapas\" bring a cozy setting, with good food, fine drinks, excellent service by friendly people, some of them with a fluent german, all bilingual in English-Spanish, and suppose many of them also speak french. The hotel has a \"Library\", a collection of maybe 100 titles, mostly in german, some in English and a few more in French, not one in Spanish! I think this is due to the fact that we spend less time vacationing and do not run out of books so easely, ha ha ha. Finally, the beach in front of the hotel is splendid, but if you or your childrens prefer the pool, there is also one at your disposition. Consequently \"Las Palapas\" has come to enlarge my list of preferred hotels, and Playa del Carmen has being added to places like Puerto Escondido and Huatulco.

Las Palapas is great because the beach is shaded by a grove of palm trees and there are big couches and oversized chairs to sit in, plus a great place to eat lunch under the palm trees at real tables. The beach bar at Las Palapas is ok, the seats are little stools in the sand. They have free drinks for ladies at 2-3 pm (I think) and happy hour for everybody, 2 for one drinks, at 5-7? something like that. For 3 of us for 7 nights hotel, in Feb 2011, with all you can eat breakfast, with all of our drinks, alcohol for hubby (beer x3 or 4/day) plus my 1 margarita, then the virgin pina for DD every day, lunch 5 days, it was $1742. You really can't beat it. Mahekal's beach isn't as shady (of course there are palapas everywhere that you can sit under, but I love the palm tree leaves drifting in the breeze up above at Las Palapas) At Mahekal, for lunch, families usually go off the beach to the restaurant to sit at a table. You can get the beach bar staff to deliver your lunch to your lounge chairs, but eating on lounge chairs is challenging with kids. There are no tables on the beach at Mahekal, or there weren't in Feb 2011 nor Dec 2010. Mahekal has a cute bar with swings, on the property but you can go there whether you stay there or not. Mahekal seems more expensive but we stayed there over the holidays in 2010-11 so everything costs more. They were offering, last I checked, hotel room plus breakfast and dinner. Kids free. So you can't really compare apples to apples due to Las Palapas' rates included bfast only. Just so you know, Mahekal will swap your dinner for lunch, if you let them know by 10am, that was their policy when we were there. We loved having lunch on the beach and going out for dinner. The street life at night is pretty great. Kids everywhere and tons of fantastic restaurants. As for the rooms, I've stayed at 2 different rooms at both properties, and the thatched roof \"palapa\" rooms on the beach just can't be beat, at either place, but they are of course the most expensive. We were upgraded at LP, due to a flooded bathroom in our \"jungle\" room. The jungle rooms at LP are actually perfect, they are really big with a seating area inside and a nice porch or deck with 2 hammocks and 2 oversized wicker chairs and a table. At LP the least expensive rooms are bigger by 2x than the least expensive at Mahekal. The jungle at LP actually has monkeys running around you wouldn't believe it, after a while they remind you of squirrels, they scavenge and beg. Either place is fabulous, you really can't go wrong. In February 2011 we stayed in a Jungle room at Las Palapas and were upgraded to a beach front room due to our 1st room flooded. We were very patient with LP front desk and stayed in the Jungle room for the first 3 days, until it was clear that the plumbing problem was out of control. We came back from the beach and the whole room was flooded and our door was wide open, with no workers inside. I was calm and friendly when I told the front desk the story, and after some back and forth they offered us another room and $25 off every night of our stay. Then about 40 minutes later, they came and found me on the beach and offered the beach bungalow for the same price (no $25 discount) for the rest of our stay. It was an amazing room, like a fantasy of what a beach front room would look like. Gorgeous. We jumped at it and really enjoyed our time there. in our first Jungle room: Sink no water - a trickle at best sheets not clean - sand/and or flying debris on the sheets No washcloths at all in the bathroom Wc didn't flush well or sometimes at all, just a weak swirl Wc seat broken, crooked on bowl - as you stood it would hit you every time Musty smells throughout the room. Windows didn't open in bathroom - hence the musty smells! Electricity switch in the closet was operated by the closet door closing and it was a bare wire that sparked blue when you opened and shut the door. Perhaps the plumbing problems explain the musty moldy smells? When I asked about the sink and toilet not working, they sent a succession of workmen and plumbers and that's when the big problems started. - the flooding, the workmen in our room all day, etc. At either Mahekal or LP, if you tip the staff even moderately, you will get special treatment and very good service. Try to speak a little spanish, ask if they have kids, how many, etc, and you will get big smiles and a fairly genuine connection.

The newer section has less privacy, but it's closer to the beach and pool. The staff was friendly and professional, at all times. This hotel is not for folks who want a modern, high rise hotel, or if you don't like to be close to nature. Also, there is no phone or tv in the rooms, and no room service.

We chose the hotel based on its prime location between the beach and 5th Avenue, and being New Yorkers, we really loved the idea of being able to disconnect from everything and just be part of nature. Las Palapas definitely delivered on these fronts, and we did have a few complaints, but we will say one thing about the hotel - DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU DO NOT LIKE NATURE!! I cannot stress this enough. I have read some reviews about \"ants in the bedroom\" or \"mosquitos in the outdoor TV hut,\" and while this could be annoying for some, they should have known what they were getting themselves into.. Las Palapas does not advertise themselves as a 5-star hotel that caters to those who want a high-end hotel experience. No, this is quite different, and it's not for everyone, but we LOVED it. ROOMS - We stayed in room 104, which was probably one of the better cabanas in the entire resort. It was tucked away in the corner of the jungle so really did not have many people walking by at all. Only issue with the location was its proximity to Mamita's. Yes, we read the reviews from others who complained and were worried about this, and yes, it did get a little annoying. Music played daily from about 12-6 (seemed to get lounder closer to 4-6) which made it difficult to relax out in our hammocks. Also played very loud music on Friday night but it stopped around 12. Other than that, we LOVED our cabana! Most other cabanas are two-story but this was one floor. Large sitting area, large patio with two chairs and two hammocks, large sexy bathroom, and nice king bed (with \"mosquito net,\" not exactly functional but definitely turned up the sexy factor). There were some teeny tiny ants but we sprayed a little OFF! and that seemed to help.. Safe is small so don't expect to be able to put a computer in there or anything, I would bring a lock for your suitcase if you want to keep large things locked away. No fridge, but I believe you can rent one for $2 USD/day (we didn't have a problem with this!) And the best part, no TV or phone in the room. We loved being able to disconnect from technology for a week, I mean, who really NEEDS to watch TV when you have such beautiful surroundings?! Really people, stop complaining about it, remember why you're on vacation... I don't think you go on vacation to watch TV or play on the computer, at least I hope not.. BEACH - The beach was absolutely gorgeous. I'm almost positive townies were coming and paying to hang out because it is just ideal. Plenty of palapas for shade and chairs for lounging. Only complaint is that the staff at the beach bar are a little lazy... They hide out in the shade and only come walk around to ask if you need anything once or twice throughout the day. I didn't even bother with waiting and just went up to bar to get things myself. The cashier (yes, only one person is allowed to run the cash register) rarely had change (we opted to settle each bill rather than charging it to our room) and even after spending two minutes counting change didn't even give us the right amount... I don't think it should be too difficult to find someone trustworthy who can actually add/subtract and count $$. Still, the staff was nice and never really gave us any attitude or anything. They also offer yoga on the beach Tues-Sun 8-9AM. I believe it costs money and if you pay a little extra you get a power breakfast included (we never participated but seemed like it would be nice). CASA CLUB - We loved the bartender at the Casa Club. He was really nice and made the best margaritas in town. We also realized on the last day that they keep board games and cards here (would have been nice to know about that!) Also, from 5-7 (on the beach too!) it's happy hour so you get 2 for 1 drinks. HEALTH CENTER - Did not try the health center but from what we saw it looked very nice. It was right next to our cabana. Apparently they have spa services but you can also get massages right by the beach. POOL - Didn't go into the pool once. Who needs it when you have the most beautiful blue waters right there? It looked a little green (heavy on the chlorine??) so we stayed away.. BREAKFAST - Anyone who complained about breakfast is silly. It was delicious and filling and included in price of room. Best part was made-to-order eggs, fresh fruit, and amazing coffee. LUNCH/DINNER - We had lunch at the beach bar three times. While it's good and convenient, we found it to be a bit overpriced. I suggest going to Chez Celine (walk to 5th Ave and it's right there on the left) for amazing sandwiches at a more reasonable price. Our first night we were so tired from travelling that we opted to stay in for dinner. DInner was being served buffet style on the beach. It was a cool experience and the food was pretty good, but for $250 pesos per person? So not worth it. OTHER - We loved the little outdoor hut with the TV and library. We didn't watch TV once but enjoyed playing ping pong and pool. Really, we just suggest taking a walk/playing some ping pong if you get bored here. Bring lots of books. And don't forget, 5th Avenue is right nearby if you want to get a little more action. Overall, WE LOVED IT!

Many bugs flying all around the food at the buffet, warm milk, cold eggs.....As far as Mamitas beach club, we hardly noticed it. Our Palapa was located on the Mamita side but all the way in the back. We didnt hear it all that much, and when we did it wasn't bad. I wouldnt worry too much about that. Be sure to check out the view from the light house. Very cool. Front desk staff is very nice.

Not a big deal though. Seemed to work when we needed it to, and if it didnt, take 5 and come back and it did.

We didn't want a downtown hotel (too noisy), a giant hotel or all-inclusive resort. We wanted a nice hotel, somewhat secluded but still walking distance from good restaurants and whatnot. Las Palapas, in that regard, fit the bill nicely for us. We found Las Palapas as it was listed on the Morgans Hotel Group website as being managed by Morgans. As they run a tight ship, we has no qualms booking. After staying there, I can say that it was not up to the standard set at Morgans' properties. With a bit of work, however, it certainly can be. Positives- Location: In Playa, you don't often have a chance for jungle seclusion just a few steps from 5th Av, but Las Palapas provides exactly that. It's on the north end of 5th Av, but is set back from the road by a (somewhat long) driveway and plenty of vegetation. The north side of 5th has plenty of good food without the masses of tourists (or, at least, smaller masses of tourists). Beach: The beach is excellent. You don't have to walk three blocks...it's right at the shore (literally) of the property. The sand is soft, rock-free and palapas are very nice for shade in the hot sun. Without a twenty-minute cab ride to a mega resort, I don't think you'll find a comparable beach in Playa. No fishing boats. No sand bags. It's very nice. Rooms: The palapa-style rooms are also very nice. They're simple, spacious and (in some cases) tucked away in the jungle. We stayed in room 104 which was a \"basic\" room tucked toward the back of the property. We considered upgrading to a beachfront palapa, but stayed with 104 as it offered much more privacy and was a decent amount larger. Some of the palapas are double-decker, others offer little privacy (especially by the pool, restaurant or beach), but we felt nicely tucked away. Negatives- Mamitas: It's hard to blame Las Palapas for their neighbor, but Mamitas is an earsore. It's a beach club packed with Jersey Shore equivalents (be they Euro, South American, etc.), sipping red bull as if they just heard about it, with the droning bass of house music throughout the afternoon. Depending on the direction of the wind, you may hear it...and be bothered by it. You might also not notice. If Mamitas were a bit more considerate (speaker/subwoofer relocation), they could make things easier for their neighbors. I expect that the front desk at Las Palapas fields plenty of complaints. [For perspective...I'm not an old-timer...I'm a nightclub owner who is around loud music on a regular basis] Beach bar: We found the service by beach bar staff to be very poor. While hospitality workers (in general) in Playa are friendly and hard-working, the opposite was the case at the beach bar. Packs of staff would remain at the bar, not taking orders, not bussing tables, not delivering orders...just standing and talking. We placed orders that never arrived on multiple occasions. Once, when I asked if my order was coming (just two drinks...and I waited twenty minutes to inquire), I was told to come back later and pick them up myself. The only time that the staff seemed to work hard and pay attention was when the manager (owner?) was in the area. One might think that they just don't want to pester guests...no, not the case. When shifts are switching, they will instantly appear at your table requesting that you close your tab (rather than leaving you alone as they transfer to the new server). We were asked, one day, to close our tab after each order we placed. Frankly, the beach bar service was the worst part of the Las Palapas experience. It was almost as if the work had been contracted out to another company. I'm not one to complain about service [again...my business is hospitality and I'm sensitive to invalid complaints by pushy customers]. That was not the case here. It seemed to merely be a matter of employees not eager to work unless directly supervised. By way of contrast, the front desk and housekeeping/maintenance staff were very pleasant and hard working. Somewhat rundown property: Without a major investment, the property could be spruced up to Morgans' standards. The rustic, jungle vibe is perfect for the property, but new mattresses (that don't make a \"BOINNNNGG\" noise as you lie down) and bedding would be nice and welcomed. More comfortable beach chairs would also be a simple and dramatic change. Las Palapas is indeed a very nice property, but there does appear to be a bit of neglect. In general, I'd stay there again in Playa without hesitation. It's comfortable, it's well located and the beach is great. With some fairly simple changes, this could easily be a great property. Food notes: -Eat at \"La B del M\" (just 1/2 block north on 5th Av.). The food (cuban/mexican) is excellent, staff incredibly friendly and price very reasonable. -El Fogon (there are multiple locations on 30th) is great stop for local food. -Basico (5th and 12th?) has a very good casual restaurant on the 2nd floor with must-have blue crab tostadas..", "Date": "April 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Morristown, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cNot the place to stay\u201d", "Author": "Traaaavel", "ReviewID": "UR104147977", "Content": "While I was initially not going to express my opinion, it pains me to think that positive posts, by management in my opinion, are truly misleading. This place was a total rip off. They SCAMMED ME on the price that they confirmed, in writing, before I arrived. When I checked out, they presented me with a bill in Spanish and showing amounts in pesos. They rushed me out by saying that I needed to close out quickly or else their airport van would leave. When I got home and did the conversion, they cheated me out of over $100! When I called them, they said not to worry, just notify my credit card company and it will be fixed. When my credit card company asked them about it, they fought my company (contrary to their assurances) and used the receipt in Spanish to dispute their prior confirmation in English. Setting that aside, the ROOMS WERE DIRTY. There were ants on my floor and in my bed. Small ants, but there were tons of ants. The shower was gross, and required a towel to cover the sight of it. It took two complaints to get them to fix the shower so that we had hot water. The windows do not close all the way, so you can see people walk by while in the bathroom, hear people in adjoining rooms and people walking by, including the thumping sound from a bar down the beach, while trying to sleep. Even if they did not rip me off, I was grossed out by things that I experienced at this place. As for the TV that they told me I would have, it was in a mosquito filled outdoor hut. I will say, however, the staff was nice. That said, this experience was not unique to me. People who had a wedding there at the same time complained about being SCAMMED on the price of their rooms upon arrival and spoke of the DIRTY ROOMS.

I wasn't expecting such a nice place! I had read some of the reviews and, as usual, relied on the most negative ones to have a genuine idea of the place. Well, I'm happy I did because I couldn't agree less with the negative reviews. In fact, I was more than pleasantly surprised. Yes, there were a few glitches but, overall, this hotel is absolutely fabulous. I was travelling solo and didn't want to stay at a big resort because as a single woman, I was concerned I would stand out among all the couples, groups of friends and families that usually go to large resorts. So, I was looking for a small boutique hotel where I would not feel overwhelmed by the size of the place and close enough to a sizeable town where I could escape to shop when I would feel a bit lonely. At the same time, I didn't want such a small hotel that I would not feel safe at night. Las Palapas is located at the end of Avenido 5 far enough not to be in the action but close enough (not even a 5 min walk) from all the action. It is right on the beach which is absolutely GORGEOUS and clean. The cabanas and rooms are all scattered in a jungle-like garden which at night is dimly and gives an eerie air to the place. My room was spotless throughout my stay. Breakfast is plentiful and delicious. The staff was very attentive, caring and nice. Unlike other guests, I did not find any of the staff inappropriate or disengaged. In fact, I would say that the only sour faces I saw were the tourists. I mean some of them could hardly make eye when you met them and this is a small place so you tend to meet everyone a few times.. I mean, we're on vacation for Pete's sake!!! No wonder the nice Mexican staff can feel a bit intimidated at times and might be led to believe that the tourists just want to be left alone... I reserved through the Morgan hotels website since this property seems to be part of that group. I had to give the reservation central a call to clear up something and the first person I spoke with did not even know that Las Palapas was part of their group. Rather than offering to assist me, she said that I should call the hotel directly. Thankfully I was transferred to this person's supervisor who was extremely helpful in assisting me. However, like some of past reviews, I must say that the music emanating from the beach club nxt door can be a bit bothersome... It usually stops around 7:00 pm but on weekends it can last much longer. If you can, ask for a room on the other side of the resort (the one adjacent to Mahekal Hotel). At night, the music in the lobby was very loud and rock and roll which I felt was too bad. Mexican music is so nice and we can now find very loungy mexican artists. Given the Boutique allure of the place, I found that disco and dance music was not the best of choices for this place... Alas, just like I had read in some of the reviews, my sheets were stained with blood. This last point has to be resolved by Las Palapas management because it can be very disturbing especially when you pay 185$ a night... Oups, one last point : prices for the food is a bit expensive (although the food is very good). 20$ for fajitas is uncalled for in Mexico...", "Date": "April 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cBest Hotel in Playa del Carmen\u201d", "Author": "Klaw46", "ReviewID": "UR102097879", "Content": "We have stayed at Las Palapas with your children and extended family every year since 2003.

And do not let seller to cheat you inviting you to \"have a meal\" while they show you a \"new hotel\".. they just want to sell you a lot of expensive thing that you so not need, and they will really make you to have a very very bad time and waste a whole day.. do not do it please! ok.. back to the hote las palapas....The breakfast is delicious! and if they do not have something yoy like they will try to get it for you.

We loved the main dining area as wll as the lovely bar and lounge on the grounds. We have no complaints. We barely heard Mamasitas. Perhaps because we were situated the farthest from it on the grounds. Did not bother us. Staff were very friendly and helpful. We will certainly return and await the day.

The staff was friendly, the location was relaxing, and the and the grounds were beautiful. Rooms Las Palapas gets its name from the palm thatched roofs on the rooms and buildings. It was really cool going to sleep every night looking up into the thatchwork above us, and the roofs give the resort a very authentic Caribbean feel. We had one of the second floor rooms set back from the ocean a bit, surrounded by rainforest, so we often saw tropical birds and little geckos in the trees out our windows (and heard them as a morning \"wake-up call\"). When you book your room, you might be able to request if you want one closer to the beach or tucked into the rainforest near the resort enterance. All of the rooms appeared to have a patio with hammocks, and ours also had a couple chairs outside as well. Although the room had air conditioning, we were able to just open the windows and turn on the fan to let the fresh ocean breeze in. Bottled water was provided, but the tap water is actually safe to drink as well. Grounds The grounds are really beautiful, blending from rainforest up front to white sandy beach and palm trees on the shore. The layout has winding sidewalks and vegetation throughout, resulting in a cozy, natural landscape. You can't even see the resort buildings from the ocean. There's also a nature trail and lookout tower on the property that are definitely worth checking out. The lookout tower is a bit hard to find, but worth the short hike for the view. The dirt nature trail is a quick hike that leads you through undeveloped rainforest. We saw several cenotes along the way, as well as several raccoon-like animals called tehones. Make sure you put on some bugspray before you go! Amenities The resort has a great beach with free beach chairs and palapa umbrellas. There's a watersports shop on the beach that has things like scuba diving and jet skis. We did two scuba dives with Emelio while we were there and enjoyed both of them. There's a beach bar that has a one-hour two-for-one happy hour every evening (I think 5-6), and the lounge in the middle of the grounds has its happy hour right after that (6-7). (Be sure to put bugspray on your legs for the beach bar happy hour.) We really enjoyed the onsite restaurant. It had a great all-you-can-eat breakfast buffet that included Mexican breakfast items, fruit, and an omelet station. We usually ate out on 5th Avenue for dinner (I highly recommend Yaxche), but we did eat at the resort one night when they had a mariachi band playing. Apparently they have that every Sunday, along with other themes other nights of the week. We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful.

It seems the 1st visit the area was still reeling from a hurricane, and the grounds were in a state of shock. But this time the grounds were outstanding, very well manicured, and full of all sorts of lush tropical vegetation. Our room was as expected, no frills and very clean, we booked a standard garden and got a 2nd level, we had enough privacy and spent much time on the patio. Yes, the beds are hard, but after a few beers, passing out never felt so good. The bathroom was standard, plenty of vanity space, the toilet had a privacy wall that literally was in your face and on your knees, but the shower, no tub in ours, was fantastic, plenty of hot water and great pressure. So the room was spot on to our expectations. The beach area was a little crowded probably due to the slow erosion from the waves(which were huge), but was very relaxing and fun to people watch, plenty of lounges and palapas to use, and a beach bar area right there. I would highly recommend the breakfast buffet, it's not over the top crazy with food and variety, but just simple and to the point, with fresh breads, juices and eggs. And with the service you cant go wrong. As far as dinner goes we only ate it once, it was a mexican buffet that was all right. But breakfast is a must. Over all we enjoyed the resort and the people who operate it, no issues with service from the front desk to the beach area.

I loved lounging in one of the hammocks on the porch. The cabana was clean and comfortable. Breakfast is included in the price of a room, and we also had dinner at the hotel a couple times during our stay. The meals were served buffet-style and were delicious. There were always a variety of dishes, some Mexican, some not. My wife and I got massages while we were at Las Palapas. My wife got the relaxation massage, which she thoroughly loved. I got a deep tissue massage, and it hurt so good! The beach at Las Palapas is not as busy or crowded as the area closer to downtown Playa. The sand was beautiful--I was amazed at how clean the beach was up and down the coast, given the number of people using it. The hotel had many guests from Germany, Italy, and France, and our neighbors were from Argentina. My wife and I really enjoyed the international flavor of the hotel.

But I can see where it might bother some people. Also, my wife lost a pair of earrings while we stayed, and despite alerting the staff, they were never found.

At times we woke up at the sound of wildlife rustling around on the thatched roof. (Cats, monkeys, raccoons?) We dont like air conditioning - you can't hear the sea at night - and found the ceiling fans kept the rooms very comfortable at night. Our thatched roof terrace outside the room had comfortable furniture as well as a pair of hammocks in which to spend the late afternoon hours while recovering from the day's sun and getting ready to go out at night. Garden villas had no sea view but were much more private than the beach villas. Songbirds stray cats and a coatimundi that roamed around seemed to be our only neighbors .

We dont do discos and avoid bars full of drunken cruise-ship types but found sophisticated watering holes (some way too expensive), upscale tequila bars, good live music, and a night scene that rivaled anything on Miami's South Beach.

This place is completely breath-takingly gorgeous - if this happens to be your type of thing. If you tend to opt for huge purpose-built all-inclusives, then this probably will not appeal - as the key words here are quiet, intimate and brimming with character. THE LOCATION: Las Palapas is located relatively centrally in Playa Del Carmen (it is dead easy to get into the main town - no more than a five minute leisurely stroll). However, it is far enough removed that you will experience no noise at all. Playa Del Carmen itself is relatively nice, though don't count on getting any bargain souveniers - all the prices are hoiked up considerably as it is a tourist resort. Same goes for food. Playa literally consists of one major strip of shops that runs for 5km; it is nice enough to walk down, though you will get harrassed slightly by shop owners desperate for you to have a look in their shop! LAS PALAPAS FACILITIES: Las Palapas has a really nice restaurant, though personally, I would advise going out and eating in town at night for a bit of variation! The restuarant, like all the buildings in Las Palapas, has a gorgeous straw roof, which when lit at night is very atmospheric. They also do a GREAT breakfast in the morning, choice from yoghurts, fruit, breads, cheese, ham, plus hot choices like omelette made how you like it and Mexican traditional fare such as refried beans! The bar is also great - check out happy hour - two cocktails for the price of one. This works out such good value - and their margaritas are very nice. The bar also does good lunches that are reasonably priced and you get lots of free tortilla chips with it to keep you full up! The nicest thing about the bar, is late at night, the racoons and the coatis run round it to see if there's any food going. (don't worry, they won't come near you, but it is cool to see them!) There is a small beach bar too and a shop to buy souveniers in (again, overpriced) and a library area, where you can borrow books that other people have left behind. The swimming pool is of an ok size, perfectly good enough to have a dip and is nicely secluded. THE ROOMS: The rooms are relatively basic, but this is part of their character. Be warned though, the beds are HARD. I had trouble sleeping a few nights. You will get a lot of mosquitos as well, so bring necessary preventative measures! The rooms generally have the lovely straw roofs and you also get two hammocks, which is by far and away the best thing, nothing beats swinging in a hammock reading a book! THE BEACH: The beach is only a few seconds walk from some of the rooms, and is beautiful, as you would expect for this part of the world - white sands, lush clear blue sea, palm trees, gorgeous. There is a dive centre right next door if you fancy a go at that as well! In summary, I recommend this place totally. I went there for my honeymoon, and we had such a lovely time. We even loved it despite hurricane dean turning up in the middle (causing us to be evacuated to the far less pleasant Moon Palace for four days!) This is a warning I would give you, especially if you are from the UK and not familiar with hurricanes: travel agents will NOT mention this to you, but it is very common to get hurricanes, right from august through to November. Don't worry too much though, the Mexicans certainly don't - they are totally used to it!

But hurry. This hotel is closing in January 08, and will be torn down for condos. A real loss, because I thought it was the most charming beach front hotel in town. Description: Quiet, full of gardens, intimate, casual. Open air restaurants. Great beach (I thought the nicest on stretch just north of pier) and beautiful grounds. Has two restaurants and beach bar. Walking distance to Avienda Quinta, a mostly pedestrian shopping/restaurant district that is quite lovely at night. Rooms: Various palapa (on 2nd floor and 1 story) and non-palapa (on 1st floor) rooms. Basic, with decently sized balconies with hammocks. Clean and comfortable with A/C. I recommend the NORTH side of the property, which is a little quieter. (Construction and techno music from nearby hotel on south side.) If you get a palapa, you will enjoy the vaulted ceiling, but if you like to sleep in, be advised, the birds start chirping at the crack of dawn and can sound like they are roosting inside! Mexican beds are notoriously hard. I went to Walmart my first day and bought an egg-crate mattress for about 12 bucks that made a huge difference. Beach: Clean, wide and sea-weed free with palapas and lounge chairs. Always a lounge chair available. Also had hammocks and tables/chairs. Good swimming beach. Some toplessness, so if that makes you uncomfortable, be forewarned. Food: Breakfast buffet-style with hot foods, cereals and breads. Best meal of day. Lunch-restaurant servicable with typical American type fare and some local dishes. Dinner tended to be a bit more ambitious, but wasn't particularly veggie-friendly, so I ate out. (They were willing to accommodate any request, though.) LOTS of restaurants in walking distance. Breakfast and dinner (including tips) was included in the room price. Drinks, lunch extra. Service/Staff: So friendly and helpful. From the groundskeepers (one of which showed off the resident iguana who comes out each morning to greet the guests) to the waiters who remember you by name. I feel bad that these people will be out of work in several months. They are really great. Every request was met with a great attitude. Pool: Nice, clean, shady - not huge, with a shallower end for toddlers. Right by beach in grove of palms. Kids: I saw some kids, although the overall resort isn't geared toward them. That is, there's no activities, kids' club, etc. But the pool and beach are nice and the area has a ton of things to do. Other: *There is a fitness center and spa. *Internet is confined to 2 PCs set up in the lobby. Best for checking email, flights, short web searches, as there always seemed to be someone waiting to use them. No wi-fi at hotel, but tons of internet cafes in walking distance, including good old Starbucks, about a 10 minute walk down Avienda Quinta. *Check out the \"Mirador\" a lighthouse shaped building on the grounds that you can climb up and see across the property, town and to the ocean. *Also, there is a short but charming jungle path that begins in the parking lot. In the morning and evening you can see badgers, raccoons, lizards and even monkeys. *PDC now has a Walmart and Sam's Club down highway 307 if you need supplies - especially sunscreen and the other stuff you can't bring on a plane. *The closest alternative to Las Palapas on that stretch in PDC is Shangri-La Caribe (right next door), which I found in my research to be more expensive.", "Date": "May 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Costa Mesa, California", "Title": "\u201cLove Las Palapas, sad to hear it will close in October...\u201d", "Author": "UM1997", "ReviewID": "UR7253491", "Content": "This was our 2nd time at Las Palapas and 3rd time in Playa del Carmen. I have nothing but positive things to say about Las Palapas, the bungalows are comfortable and rustic, the grounds are perfectly maintained and beautiful, the beach is expansive and tranquil and the staff treats you like family. The only downside? Learning that Las Palapas has been sold and will close in October. No one there seemed to know what the new owners will do with the property, but there is certainly fear that it will be torn down and replaced with the new, modern condo buildings that are popping up all over Playa. What was once a quiet little village has now become a mini Cancun with 2 Starbucks, a Burger King, Subway, and Diesel Jeans...I guess it's time for us to find somewhere new to go to!! But back to our experience at Las Palapas. We booked 2 \"garden deluxe\" rooms, which are bigger than their standard rooms- a little further away from the beach but tucked into the jungle and really, really quiet. When we arrived, we were offered a suite- which is a new building just opened in November. It was a 3 bedroom apartment with a huge kitchen, dining room, balcony and living room with flat screen TV. I'm sure many people would jump at the chance to stay in a place like this, but for us, what we loved about Las Palapas was the rustic quality of the resort- little thatched roof bungalows with no TVs or telephones, so we opted to stay back at the main resort in our \"garden deluxe\" rooms. We chose to have the half board meal plan so we had breakfast and dinner included each day. Breakfast consisted of a buffet with fresh fruit, cereals, breads, juices, a few hot items and made to order eggs. Dinners were sit down with 2 choices of appetizer and 3 choices of entrees. There were also a few themed buffet dinners, such as the Mayan buffet on Monday, a Caribbean grilled dinner on the beach on Wednesday and a Mexican buffet on Saturday. All had live music and all of the meals were delicious. The wait staff is so friendly and really takes the time to get to know their guests. They also speak many languages and were able to talk to all of the guests with ease (I would say about 85-90% of the guests were European- German, French, Italian and English). Our days were spent at the beach where there were plenty of beach chairs and palapas to go around. I read 3 books while I was there because there is nothing to do but relax! If I wasn't reading on the beach, I was reading on my hammock on my porch- or reading in bed before I went to sleep. The resort is really quiet and peaceful so if you're looking for a crazy party place, this is definitely not it. Also, although there were a few kids around when we were there, this is not a real kid friendly kind of place, as there are no structured activities for children. It's basically the beach or the pool for kids. I highly recommend this resort for anyone who needs a quiet place to relax. It saddens me to know that Las Palapas has been sold and will close, but the Shangri-La right next door will remain open. I have been to both resorts and they pretty much are identical so if you're planning a trip after October and are looking for a quiet place to stay, look at Shangri-La.", "Date": "March 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cwe were the only firstimers/perfect\u201d", "Author": "DCBigben", "ReviewID": "UR6808190", "Content": "With great reason, we were the only people we met who were there for the first time at Las Palapas.

We never ate dinner at the hotel because there were so many other great restaurants along 5th. A word about the noise some people have complained about. I think we were lucky to have a room on the opposite side of the property from the condo construction and beach noise. Occasionally, on the beach you could hear some faint techno music. However, from our room (north side) you could hear nothing. We walked over to the other side of the property (near the observation tower) one day and could hear the music clearly. Also we had a garden deluxe room which I think (from talking to other guests in the beach bungalows and my own observations) are more private than the beachfront rooms. I liked the second floor room we had because you had a nice view of the property and it felt private (we were on our honeymoon). The beds were not the most comfortable I've ever had, but they were fine and we didn't have problems sleeping. Bring bug spray if you want to walk in the jungle on the property. There are a few mesquitos on the property at night, but we were warned by the staff not to venture on the jungle walk without bug spray. The walk to the observation tower is short and a nice alternative (especially if you have kids). The staff was wonderful, very helpful with anything we asked. We broke a glass one night and asked the front desk to have someone sweep the floor and in about ten minutes a maintanence person was at our door. The only complaint was that the hotel arranged for someone to pick us up at the airport and we couldn't find them when we arrived at Cancun. But that worked out fine because we had thought about taking the ADO bus, so we hopped on the bus. When we arrived at the hotel, the front desk person said \"that that sometimes happens\" and said the guy had called the hotel when he couldn't find us.

We originally saw this property featured in a National Geographic Traveler magazine. The hotel was scarcely occupied the days we were there, as well as the entire hotel industry in the area, so we felt that we had the run of whatever we wanted to do without much hassle. We'd been to Cancun several times, but now that we've visited Playa, we'll be coming back here whenever we visit the Yucatan. If you're looking for a more relaxed, pedestrian-friendly town, Playa fits the bill. We used the hotel's recommended taxi/car service to pick us up at the airport-- wonderful, carefree and easy! We'd recommend it to anyone. Just ask when you make your reservations. We checked in around 1 pm without any problem. The property itself was beautiful-- very eco-friendly. We saw the two monkeys that \"run\" the hotel while we were there :). We stayed on the second floor of a cabana-- very cool view of the thatched roof! We had a room with air conditioning...the air conditioner didn't work so well, but we were fine. The room was clean and adequate. However, if there was one drawback of this property, it would have to be the somewhat antiquated and spartan feel of the rooms. The furniture is dated, the bed linens are incredibly scratchy and the amenities are sparse-- it's okay that there's no TV or phone, but it would be nice to have at least a clock and/or a radio. The biggest annoyance was that there was hardly ever any hot water to be had-- we have a feeling that each cabana shares a tiny water tank....so take a shower when your neighbors aren't around! The hammocks are a nice touch and we found them to be nice after returning from the beach, pre-dinner time where we could enjoy a beer. That being said, you don't go to a beach front property to sit on 400 thread count sheets and order room service while you channel surf! The beach was out of this world!! Very nice beach with not too many people....clean sand that was raked every morning. Seaweed was a tiny problem-- one day there was none, the next day, it was everywhere. The hotel's beach bar served drinks at a reasonable price ($2-3 for a beer or soft drink). The beach made this property what it is. The beach is unbelievable and won't disappoint anyone. We would recommend this hotel solely based on the beach. The breakfast was great and the servers were attentive and extremely friendly. The lunch restaurant served a wide variety of dishes at very reasonable prices. The hotel makes if very easy to relax and not worry about your pocketbook if you decide to eat their food and drink their drinks-- something that doesn't happen in Cancun unless you're at an all-inclusive. One word-- this hotel caters to the European crowd, which didn't bother us. We were the only Americans on site the days we were there. If you have children, be prepared for lots of topless women.

We booked it largely based on other recommendations from this site. I received an email at home several days before arrival confirming our reservation, a nice touch. Check-in was prompt. We had a second story \"garden deluxe\" room (caba\u00f1a #50) at the northwest corner of the property. The rooms were fairly large with two double beds (hard as expected), tiled bath with large shower (no bathtub), sitting area with wicker couch, 3 chairs, desk and coffee table. There was a small bar near the door where you could dump all your \"stuff.\" At the back was a large sitting area with two huge hammocks and a small plastic table and two chairs. Closet space wasn't large, but adequate. No TV. A small refrigerator was delivered in about 30 minutes after we asked. The property was full of large 2 story bungalows with thatched roofs. Each bungalow appeared to have 2 caba\u00f1as per floor except for the beach-front caba\u00f1as, which stood alone, I think. Our garden room had air conditioning. It was very quiet. Even from the back of the property we still heard the ocean while lounging on the hammocks at night. The clientele was heavily European with some Aussies and Kiwis. Desk staff appeared to speak most European languages as well as English fluently. Wait staff spoke good English, but may have spoken others as well. Service staff didn't speak much English at all. Hurricane Wilma appeared to have damaged many of the palms on the property. There were ropes and stakes supporting many of the remainng trees. The beach front trees in the web site pictures appear much denser than they are now. That being said, there were no other visible signs of hurricane damange. The beach didn't appear to have eroded much. We chose PDC in lieu of Cancun because we'd read the beaches weren't restored there yet. The at this hotel beach was superb. Palapas with lounge chairs were easy to get, even after a not so early breakfast. There wasn't a single day we arrived at the beach where there weren't at least two chairs available. The pool wasn't large, but plenty big for the number of people there. There was no jacuzzi or hot tub. There's no doubt this is the best section of beach north of the Cozumel ferry. We walked south all the way to the ferry and the beaches got worse the farther south you went. Playacar may be better. We didn't get that far. The property is not all-inclusive, but offers breakfast and halfboard (breakfast and dinner) options. We chose the breakfast only option. Don't miss it! It was a daily highlight. Fresh fruit, bread and pastries. This would be it for most places, but not here. There also was a european-style meat/cheese/yogurt spread plus several hot dishes like sausage, bacon, and potatoes. My highlight was the made to order omelet with fresh salsa (pico de gallo). Most days we didn't eat lunch. The two hour happy hour offers 2 for 1 drinks at the beach-side bar. The bar also serves food from the restaurants. There are a couple restaurants on site that serve dinner, but we only ate one dinner at the hotel, a beach-side buffet on evening. It was better than good, but I wouldn't rate it super. It was nice evening all the same getting to know some of the other guests. We sat with one couple from California and one from Switzerland. When you arrive they ask you what language you speak and seat you with a compatible group, another good deed. At night we took a short taxi ride to 5th Ave. for dinner and shopping. We highly recommend La Parilla and the Italian Restaurante de Bruno's. Overall though the staff made the biggest difference. They were all very friendly and helpful. By the end of the week most were addressing us by our last name. All had fun with playful comments to our son. The only problem we had was with our day trip to Xcel Ha. The travel agent didn't pick us up, so we were waiting in reception for over an hour. The staff said that it was a holiday and many non-regulars were on duty at the travel company, which probably resulted in the mix-up. They rebooked us for the following day. We loved Xcel Ha. Snorkeling with thousands of tropical fish was awesome, even saw a sting ray. One tip I would offer is to ask the taxi to take you to the Mega store on the way back from dinner. It's a Wal-Mart-like store just a couple blocks off 5th Ave. Stock up on drinks and snacks. Get more sunscreen or a mask and snorkel. Then hop a cab back to the hotel right from the store. There's a taxi stand right at the store. We found this place while looking for an ATM. The vanilla at the store was 1/5 the cost of that at the airport. I've posted a couple pictures here, but there are lots more from our trip on my flickr account <http://www.flickr.com/photos/jj_mac/sets/72057594115102823/>. I hope this helps.

The place is an oasis of tranquility in the midst of Playa's very active beach scene. I was lucky to get a beachfront bungalow (cabana) on what I consider, after three prior trips to the Maya Riviera, to be the loveliest beach in the region: pure white sand, sparkling pure water, and numerous palm trees (which nicely survived the recent hurricane). There were plenty of chaise lounges for everyone, nicely spaced under small thatched structures for shade. I was one of very few Americans there. Las Palapas evidently attracts Europeans, mostly. The hotel staff are able to communicate quite competently in Spanish, English, French and German! Everyone, from reception staff to bartenders to maids, were warm, gracious and efficient. After a couple days, the waiters, bartenders and front desk personnel greeted me by name. Although the hotel (really not a typical hotel, it's a collection of luxury bungalows) feels wonderfully isolated, it is only a 5-minute walk to Avenida 5, the town's pedestrian-only street lined with many shops and restaurants.
