I walked into Rush Inn expecting it to be a terrible Hotel based on the reviews I read on this website and had low expectations. I was greeted pleasantly by the staff and while I read some people had their passport kept with Reception for a long period of time, mine was scanned and returned immediately, so I was off to a good start. I was given a room on the 6th floor, which is the main reason why my stay here was pleasant. THE ROOM: My room was neat and tidy, had clean sheets and pillows. The Bathroom had the basics and was fairly clean. Yes, there was mould on the edges of the shower base, but the shower head worked fine and I could take a 15min bath in hot water. The balcony is probably home to pidgeons and it's not that clean, but let's face it, this isn't a 5 star resort you plan to spend the day enjoying. Like most people, you're probably here to spend the night. The sleep quality was quite good because the room was on the 6th floor. There are a few night clubs on the first floor and at night, from the 6th floor if you really strain your ears, you can hear the faint thud of bass, but honestly, it's not a problem on this floor. THE RESTAURANT: I only had Breakfast here and it was standard, which for me was good. It consisted of half Indian food and half continental. No problems here, I enjoyed it. THE LOCATION: Probably the best aspect of this hotel. 50m to the right is the metro. Opposite the hotel and across the main road are many shops, both for dining and electronics among others. If you take a right at the main road where the metro station is and follow the road, you will find fast food outlets. The hotel is about 30min away by train (with a change of lines) from Dubai Mall and Burj Khalifa, so it's not exactly what I would call centrally located. OTHER: If you have booked a tour then you will have no problems, however, I noticed that Arabian Adventures doesn't pick up from this location, which suggests it's not one of the more commonly associated Hotels. However, next to reception is a tour booking desk which will be helpful. Wi-fi costs 15AED for 1hr or 50AED for 24hrs ***CONCLUSION*** I would only recommend this Hotel if you can get a room on the 5th floor of above. Any floor below and you will have a sleepless night! Remember, this is only a 3 star hotel and certainly nothing more. Also, 3 star hotels in Western Countries are slightly better if you are a fussy customer.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cSo so Dirty worse hotel I have ever stayed in.

Well stayed is perhaps the wrong word. I booked this hotel for some where to leave our cases before a 3am flight. We had been on a cruise. They add 20% taxes to the bill!! The room was tiny. The furniture was tatty and old. In one of the drawers was a hair left by someone else. The pillow had a stain and a hair on it. The bedding was dirty and I mean dirty. The shower was just a pipe and sprayed the whole bathroom including the shaver socket! It was so dirty with black mould on the ceiling. The mould extended in to the bedroom with numerous patches across the ceiling. The small dirty balcony housed a nest of baby pigeons on it!! When did you last see that. There is no safe. I don't know where the iron and ironing board was as advertised but it certainly wasn't in my tiny room. We eventually left for the airport early as we just couldn't stay any longer in this dirt pit. Our room was on floor 2 and the nightclub on floor 1 started playing load music at 8.45pm. It was so loud and I doubt anyone would be able to sleep through that.

The rate is acceptable and much cheaper compared if you walk in and check in on the spot.We personally contacted Rush Inn receptionist (Sherina) one month and also 3 days before the trip to ensure we got a place to stay in Dubai. We requested for a room higher from the mezzanine floor where the nightclub is located to avoid the noises. They requested us to give our passport for them to scan our details which we are quite reluctant to give in the first place. If they just write down the details from our passport than it should be okay for us. Besides that in general we do not have any complaints after making a comparative study of various hotels and the rate is acceptable though we expected a lower room rates.
