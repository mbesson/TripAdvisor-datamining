Our apartment or suite was well appointed, spacious and spotlessly clean. It also had cooking facilities and a large fridge. While the decor was not luxurious, it was comfortable and more than adequate. The bathroom was excellent and the bed wonderful. The traveller who wrote that the apartment was noisy must have had the windows constantly open, because we slept like babies and one could not hear any noise from the bedroom whatsoever. It is true that there are about ten stairs to negotiate from the lobby to the elevators, and we do not travel lightly, however the staff immediately offered assistance. If you walk outside and cross the street you are able to walk through the stunning Jardines de Sabatini and exit opposite the Plaza de Espana or near the Royal Place and then wander through the heart of this beautiful city. My only complaint would be that there is a charge of 30 Euro to use the washing machine. I expect a charge however not so much.

It's also possible to walk to Gran Via & Sol. In fact we did it 3 times during our stay, enjoying the entertaining street performers, some shopping & appreciating the lively Madrid city along the route. The most distinct thing about this hotel, are the great service and warm receptions of the staff.

The suite we had was the more expensive one, on the fifth floor, with a view of the royal palace. This was nice, plenty of space for our family of three. Yet our bedroom faced a very small light well, there was a constant unpleasant odor which did not really make it a place we wanted to relax in. Our living room faced the street but we had to keep those windows closed because of constant and overwhelming traffic noise. Very nice and modern bathroom, but although it was clear that there were three of us in the suite we consistently kept getting too few towels. Cleaning staff kept using guest elevators at breakfast time as if that was the most normal thing. Keep in mind that this is not a proper hotel, so many services are not offered.

A couple of other details: everything really works in the hotel, rooms are quiet (even though we were facing the street) and pleasantly spacious and more than enough for a family of four. Now that I have seen what it is like to have a fully equipped kitchen, I do not understand how I was surviving with family in other hotels before! Simply put, if you are coming with the family to Madrid, look no further and simply come here.

However, I troubled over what to rate it. We were given a room on the 2nd floor. They are lucky enough to be able to be renovating right now and were doing so on the second floor. Unfortunately, this led to an awful chemical/off-gassing smell within the hallway. I thought it was significantly better in our room (although not completely gone) but my husband, who is more sensitive was very bothered by it. We asked to move, but they said they were booked full. When we returned our second night late and hoping to hose down the children, we found brown water in all the faucets. (Maybe again from the construction, although I can't be sure.) However, at this juncture, the staff responded extremely quickly, with apologies, and moved us to a room on the sixth floor. They even actually carried much of our stuff up there and then also gave us a free breakfast (which was delicious, but dieters be warned). There was no smell at all and no problem with the water on floor 6 and after that our stay was perfect. The staff also checked in on us again later. So this is a modern, clean, new hotel, with huge rooms well suitable for a family of four, with an excellent view of Palacio Real and with very courteous hotel staff (warm and friendly from the start - excellent English), but with the catch about the construction.

We stayed on the top floor in the suite with a terrace facing the Palace Real. The view was perfect and we didn't hear any street noise (which was nice, because the hotel is on a very busy street). The room was very spacious - kitchenette, living room with terrace, large bathroom and bedroom with a king size bed. But the decorations are cold and sparse. The floors are slate tiles and there was one area rug that kept sliding all over the place, which was annoying. In the bedroom, there was a large armoire - plenty of room for all of your clothes and shoes - but there was a large area in the middle for a TV and it was empty! Instead there was a small TV on the wall that was half obstructed when the door was open - just weird. The roof deck is very nice - lots of comfortable seating and again the great view. But as others have said, this part of the hotel as well as some others are getting rough around the edges and need some maintenance. Also, the roof deck would benefit from a bar or snack service. There actually was a small bar, but no one was working at it. The location of this hotel isn't bad - it's located right near the Palace and Old Madrid and there are many sights you can walk to. The bus is right outside too. The nearest metro stop is Principe Pio where you can catch the 6 or the 10 train, the shuttle to Opera and even a renfe train. There is also a nice shopping mall attached to the station. Principe Pio is a 5 to 10 minute walk down a hill from the hotel. The only downside is that it's a really smelly street - urine and dirt to the point of being sticky - and it's not so pleasant to walk back to the hotel at 11pm after dinner (or whenever you go back). The street was always busy though, so it didn't feel unsafe. The highlight of this hotel for me was the woman who works the front desk during the day \u2013 I think her name was Yurema. She was always willing to do anything to help \u2013 carry luggage, make reservations, give directions, etc. She was knowledgeable and friendly. The woman working the desk at night seemed reluctant to answer questions and was knew less about the trains and sights. She was professional, but did not go above and beyond. However, she did make us reservations to an amazing paella restaurant. The last point I have is about cleanliness \u2013 when we left the room on Wednesday there was something on the floor. I thought it was a dead bug and didn\u2019t touch it. When we checked back into the room on Sunday, it was still there. Turns out it was a raisin. I don\u2019t know if someone stayed in the room while we were gone, but regardless, the floor was obviously not cleaned properly. I would recommend this hotel for the size of its rooms and the price \u2013 it\u2019s a good value. But I would not recommend a room facing the front on a low floor or you will get a lot of street noise.", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Richmond", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and value\u201d", "Author": "pulitzer", "ReviewID": "UR119813248", "Content": "Clean, well located and great staff.......would definitely stay here again.

Not a very cosy/welcoming room Location isn't very nice; you walk out onto a street with a rather unpleasant odour Service is very average (i.e. I went down to request an iron and board and the man at the front desk brought them to the lift and put them both on the floor and walked off).

They were apologetic but said they can't guarantee bed size when you book with Agoda. Huh??? That could have been my fault because I read SO MANY reviews and we were visiting 3 cities but bottom line- it was not acceptable. They offered to move us the next day and they did- to a room reeking with SMOKE! Again, we specified non smoking which, again they were sorry they couldn't guarantee. I started to have a melt down and the girl at the front desk was sorry but... when I said I was going to put a review on Trip Advisor she quickly offered up an upgrade. We got a nice suite with a king bed in a non smoking room. Nice save and I'm very appreciative they accomodated us but It was still a pain to pack up and move twice when all I wanted was what I had been promised in the first place! The bathroom in the first room wasn't up to snuff either- I need counters and after looking at the photos of counter space I was disappointed to find a pedestal sink. Breakfast was awful too- we took one look around and left! DO NOT waste your money! We went into a little corner dive about a block up toward the Plaza Espana station and had the most delicious pastry and cafe con leche with the locals. Not fancy but perfect! We also had an interesting dinner at a restaurant Duda (?) about a block away. I would recommend it for a wonderful liquor called manzanillo that they served after dinner. It was the elixir of love! On the positive, the room was clean and large enough and the front desk helpful. It was a good walk to the Plaza Mayor but it was an enjoyable one. The location by the palace was nice too.

If using the Metro from the airport, get off at Plaza de Espana and turn left towards the Royal Palace and it is about a five minute walk. We had booked a studio room at a special offer rate from a website. However, when we arrived at the hotel we were told that they had upgraded us to a suite at no extra cost. We were to the front of the building with a view from the window directly onto the Royal Palace. The facilities were excellent and very clean. The road outside is busy and there was a lot of traffic but once we closed the bedroom door at night we couldn't hear it at all. The bed itself was firm, as I like it, and the pillows were not too soft. The breakfast room was well stocked in fresh fruits, cereal, juices, breads, meats, etc and is very clean and efficiently run. On arrival I discovered that my mobile phone had been stolen from my pocket on the Metro coming from the airport. Thankfully I was able to use my wife's phone to contact my service provider back home and get the number blacklisted immediately - they did it while I was talking to them on their service line - so the number was useless to whoever had it. I managed to cancel it within 30 minutes or less of it being stolen. We bumped into a lady who explained she was the Duty Manager and she asked how we liked Madrid so far. I explained about the theft and she was very apologetic. I said there was no need as it wasn't her fault and, to be honest, could happen in any city. She said she was sorry to see this happen to visitors to her town and arranged with the reception desk to give me a complimentary call during my stay if I needed to contact anyone at home. She also offered that if I wanted to register the theft with the local police station, she could have the interview done in her office over the phone and just collect the statement later from the station as it would be much quicker than going to the station. I did not take her up on the offer but it was much appreciated and made me feel relaxed to receive this service. The Royal Palace is across the road and a nice way to get to it is through the Sabatini Gardens. From there a short walk through the Oriental Garden brings you to the Opera House and the Plaza de Isablea II provides a short walk to most sights. The furthest attraction is the Prado Gallery and this is easily reached with a 20 minute walk through the bustling commercial area. To be honest, three days is plenty of time if you only intend to see Madrid itself. All in all (apart from the theft) I really enjoyed Madrid and the hotel and its staff played a large part in this as they made our stay so comfortable.

I had booked and standard room and was given a suite on the 3rd floor. The rooms are huge and very well appointed. We had a huge double bedin a large bedroom. The lounge had a sofa bed that converted into 2 single beds. The kitchenette had a 2 ring hob, microwave and fridge. All the crockery, pans and utensils are provided, but you will have to pay a 10 euro deposit for the key, which is payable at reception. The rooms were spotless, just like the rest of the hotel, there were staff cleaning every time we left or returned to the hotel. The best part is the roof top solarium, it overlooks the royal palace and is such a peaceful haven in the middle of a busy city, great to relax and unwind with a beer after a day sight seeing. The accomodation is perfectly located equidistance between 2 metro stations, principe pio and plaza de espana. Its down hill from plaza de espana to principe pio. Plaza de espana is the best station for arriving with luggage and principe pio when leaving. The accomodation is only a short walk to the city centre and the royal palace and the metro is handy for the museums and art galleries. I would to especially praise the staff at Aparto Suite Jardines de Sabatini, they are wonderful and cannot do enough for you. Any questions do not hesitate to ask them, all the staff i spoke to spoke perfect English and were very knowledgable. I cannot praise this accomodation enough and would return to Madrid just to stay here", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Malta", "Title": "\u201cHidden luxury in the heart of Madrid\u201d", "Author": "Spiteri", "ReviewID": "UR117871533", "Content": "I have just spent 5 nights together with my husband and 2 year old boy in this aparthotel. We could not have been more satisfied. We stayed in a double suite on the 6th floor with an incredible view of the Royal Palace. Being so high up, we never heard any noise from the street below. The room, complete with kitchen and living area is very spacious, even with the extra cot. This is a necessity when travelling with young kids. What you see on their website is exactly what you get. The location is excellent. It is about 10 minutes walk from the Royal Palace and Opera, and less than 5 minutes from Plaza Espana (and we travelled with a pushchair). It is also very well served by underground, the closest being Principe Pio and Plaza Espana. Basically it is within walking distance from most attractions without all the hustle and bustle of Gran Via. A special thanks goes to Daniel at reception who was always extremely helpful and even managed to book us a table at the Tablas Flamenco which is just up the road. Great show and shouldn't be missed. Breakfast is a variety of bread, cold meats and cheese, cereals, pastries and yoghurts. Scrambled eggs and baked beans were also available. Nothing extraordinary but more than enough choice in my opinion.

Both are easy to get to from Airport or Train Station. At first the neighborhood looked a little dicey, but actually very nice. The hotel lobby is small and there are several small sets of stairs to traverse to the elevators, again small by US norms. The hotel is a renovated older building and very nice on the inside. There was additional renovation when I was ther the end of July, 2011. Good room, lots of hot water and again the view. Have the owners daughter show you the car collection. That is worth the price of the room alone. I'm a car guy and was enthralled listening to this lady talk about helping here father work on the cars when she was a little girl, she's now early 40's.

I booked to stay here because I liked the look of the roof-top. It was superb! I was able to entertain some new friends I made from a weekend wedding in Segovia, with local food and drinks in the sunshine. There is an excellent, deli a block up on same side of street, towards Metro Espanga. They are apartments, however, with hotel service. The service was the best I have ever come across. My iPhone was stolen on the metro, and the staff were very helpful with locating police station for me, aiding me in using their computer to print my boarding pass. Also they gave me a morning wake up call. Metro either side within 5 minutes. Gorgeous gardens surrounding palace, and especially on the Segovia side - all free. 5-10min walk to Metro Calle for shopping area. Or 10mins walk across palace gardens to La Latina for Calle Baja, where the best tapas in town are. Very good for bar hopping. For a retro cocktail bar, just known to the locals, Delic, Plaza De La Paja. It was like having a mini holiday in just 24 hours. While I loved the suite, roof-top and views, the staff still stood out as the best asset. I only had one night there as I was in Segovia for a wedding over the weekend.
