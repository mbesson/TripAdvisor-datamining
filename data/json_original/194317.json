The room was a bit small, but had comfortable twin beds and a clean and adequate bath, with a good shower! The hotel is located with the front on Spuistraat, and the back overlooking the Singel Canal. We couldn't get a room with canal view, but really, didn't matter, since we were not spending much time there. It is an easy walk to the tram if you want to visit Leidsplein area, or just a few stops to the central train station. But the walk is easy, also. The strange thing is that wi-fi is free in the lobby area (for 30-minute intervals), but is charged in the room (if you choose). We didn't choose to have their breakfast, which seemed a little pricey at 20 euros. We walked thru the alley next to the hotel, to a wonderful little bakery/tearoom, Lanskroon, for freshly baked croissants and coffee. They have tables outside facing the Singel Canal, and a few tables inside.

Overall a great value since we were traveling during easter break. I would stay at this hotel, same location again but would try booking through their web site and not hotels.com. Pros- 1.The location would be really hard to beat. The train station (Amsterdam Centraal) is a 10-15 min walk, the trams are 5 min away, with great exploring on foot or bike. 2.There are 2 very good choices for breakfast in the morning just outside the hotel, Le Pain & a neighborhood Backeri. There are also many good pubs in the vicinity. 3.The staff was very friendly. After giving us a small double room with a cot squeezed in, they gave us a triple room for 2 out of 3 nights. We agreed to switch by noon of the last night. They were also very helpful with directions and recommendations! 4.Mikes bike tours is just around the corner. Cons- 1.Unfortunately booking a triple room through hotels.com does not ensure that you will have a triple room, though you will pay the price for a triple. I spent a lot of time searching for a triple, so I was really disappointed! 2. The cot (extra bed) was uncomfortable. 3.

Parking is a bit sketchy (well secured underground lot) as it took us about 30 minutes to get our car out when we wanted to leave due to others blocking us in and the hotel not able to find their keys.

My Dad and I were starting a Rhine River cruise and we stayed at this property the night before our cruise began. All in all, this was a good, clean, and modern hotel. Particularly by European standards. The front desk staff were efficient, friendly, and helpful. We got a room package that included the breakfast. You definitely want this since purchasing the breakfast seperately would cost over $25 per person for a breakfast buffet no better than what you might find at a Bob Evans, Denny's, or IHOP in the States. A SMALL beer (10 oz.)in the hotel bar in the afternoon cost $6.50 USD. English language channels on the room's TV were limited to CNN International, BBC, and perhaps Bloomberg Financial. There were lots of European sports channels in the local language. The rooms were clean and modern and of average or above-average size by European standards but only half the size of that found in a \"normal\" US hotel such as Hampton Inn, Holiday Inn, or La Quinta. The room was hot (in March) and provided little or no means of getting it cooler (other than opening a window). The bathroom was extremely small and awkward to move around in but it was clean and \"modern\" (again, by European standards). The plumbing fixtures and faucets in the tub/shower are somewhat like a \"Rube Goldberg\" design - something out of a Peter Seller's movie and not readily intuitive for the average American traveller. but with a little experimentation, you'll \"figure it out\". Of great concern to all your family members should be the SAFETY aspects of the tub/shower. The floor of the tub is extremely slippery with no built-in non-skid material or rubber mat available to put down in the tub. In addition to that, the tub sides are extremely high - nearly 2 feet high - and quite difficult to climb in and out of. This tub design would NOT meet ANY U.S. safety standard. I was in the bathroom to carefully assist my elderly father to get in and out of the shower and he STILL slipped and fell on the floor, bruising his \"rear end\" very badly. And I was in their holding on to him! If I had not been there to steady and catch him, he very likely would have wound up in the hospital with a serious or life-threatening injury. This tub design is hazardous no matter what your age! As with most European showers, they seem incapable of designing one that does NOT spray water outside the tube enclosure and out all over the bathroom floor. This hotel was no exception. We had to use one of the large bath towels, along with the bath mat, to mop up all the water that went outside the tub while showering. One would think that a \"4-star hotel\" charging over $250/night could provide a better shower and tub arrangement than this! Don't count on it in Europe. The glass \"shower door\" only extended half-way across the length of the tub, allowing water hitting your body to spray out of the tub area and onto the bathroom floor. the hotel was located in a vibrant central part of Amsterdam near a canal and cafe's. In the hotel bar (where I got the $6 SMALL beer) they were selling a few assorted pastries on the bar counter. A single glazed donut was selling for 3.50 Euro! That's equal to $4.65 USD! Over 4 times the price that it would cost in a U.S. Duncan Donut shop. See the attached photo w/price list if you don't believe me! We ate dinner at a Burger King across the street from the hotel. 2 cheeseburgers, 2 small fries, and 2 small cokes cost $20 USD. Oh, and 2 small packages of ketchup cost $1.30 USD extra! Bring plenty of money with you to Europe! Overall, a nice hotel in a convenient location. Be careful in the Bathroom! Free WiFi (for only 30 minutes at a time) is only offered in the hotel lobby and you need to get a \"voucher\" from the desk staff. To use WiFi in your room is going to cost extra and is not included in the basic room charge. Europe still has not yet embraced the concept of widly available \"free WiFi access\" for hotel guests. A small wall mounted ice machine was available near the elevator on each floor but quite a walk from most of the rooms and NO ice bucket was provided in the rooms. You had to carry a couple of small room glasses to the machine to fill them up. Make sure breakfast is included in your room rate. Eating lunch or dinner in the hotel will be very expensive but there are several cafe's and casual restaurants across the street.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wokingham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood middle ranking hotel in Amsterdam\u201d", "Author": "J0hnBy", "ReviewID": "UR127730172", "Content": "A short walk from the main restaurants, central station and general amenities of Amsterdam, the NH City Hotel is handy, friendly, efficient, clean and a good base for business or tourism.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGood Location\u201d", "Author": "anoirtac", "ReviewID": "UR127720653", "Content": "This hotel was within easy walking distance of the city centre. 5 mins to Dam Square, 15 mins to Anne Frank House, 5 mins to the shopping streets, 15/20 mins to Central Station.

As I have relatives in the city this was simply a place to drop the bag, sleep, wash and eat breakfast. In fact it served its purpose pretty well. The hotel looked to be a fairly recent conversion of an elderly building. Certainly neither the bedroom or the public areas showed the signs of wear and tear you sometimes associate with the frenetic tourism of Amsterdam. The hotel location is excellent. Spuistraat runs up to the Central Station area but is sufficiently far away from there, the Dam Square and the Red Light district to avoid the noisier tourist excesses. There are a number of traditional bars and some long established if now pedestrian restaurants in the immediate area. The Amsterdam Museum which gives you an excellent introduction to the city's history is just up the street. You can walk to most of the major cultural sites and into the quirky but chic Jordaan district but if you feel lazy the tram stop is about twenty metres from the front door. Service at the Hotel was brisk, efficient and friendly; English speakers of course have no linguistic problems in Amsterdam. The bedroom was a modest size with a view over roof tops and rear entrances. The bed was comfortable and the room clean. I slept well despite the hotel having a number of guests who were out late. The bathroom was shower only and a little cramped. The buffet breakfast included hot and cold food and allowed for some substantial eating if you were so inclined. Service there was also amiable and efficient. Central Amsterdam isn't cheap but this wasn't bad value given the demand for hotel rooms from tourists. I don't normally need hotel accommodation when staying over but this is certainly worth considering again for its location, facilities and price. The range of hotel options and facilities does increase as you move out from the city centre but if you want to be close to the tourist action this is certainly worth considering.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Caernarfon, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cCanal View, lovely room\u201d", "Author": "AberystwythWelshgirl", "ReviewID": "UR124856901", "Content": "Stayed here for one night on a weekend trip in Amsterdam.

The rooms are quite nice. The showers are a bit small, but good enough. There are plenty of power outlets for all your electronics. They provide a sponge as a loofah, which does a good job. 3. The lobby has free wifi that is fast enough for VoIP calling. 4. The front desk staff was generally helpful, especially when arranging transportation to the airport. 5. There is a parking garage (for a fee) if you need it. 6. Much better price than anything comparable nearby. Cons: 1. We arrived via a rental car that we were returning right away (thankfully, considering Amsterdam is one of the scariest cities I have ever driven in, and I am used to NYC traffic) but trying to find a place to park was nearly impossible. We ended up parking in a taxi pickup stop, we think, with my wife staying in the car until all the luggage was in the hotel room. Then we swapped places and I returned the car. In short, no parking on the street. 2. Toilets. Ok, this is a first for me, I do not think I have ever had a need to review a toilet on Tripadvisor, but these were so weird that I have to. This is a little gross, but the toilets had a shelf that all your business went on until the flush pushes it off and away. The problem is when one has to take a #2, it just sits on this shelf with no water to take away the smell or anything. I had a normal bathroom experience and had to constantly flush the toilet because I started gagging. I do not why anyone would design a toilet like this, but the better question is why anyone buy toilets like this? So gross. Even though I spent most my review describing poor parking and an odd toilet, I do recommend this hotel.

It was a compact, clean room with a double bed, wardrobe, coffee making facilities, tv (which had BBC 1 and 2!), desk and a bathroom with a shower. There was a fridge in the room with water in - at an extra charge - we didn't drink it! Our room looked out over the Singel canal. We were away from the main night life but you could occasionally hear rowdiness! Nothing a pair of earplugs didn't sort out. Other hotel guests could be noisy - as with anywhere - the doors don't shut quietly!! None of this however spoilt our stay. There is free wifi at this hotel, only to be used in the lobby.

I even had a friend coming in from Belgium for what I thought would be the day but she stayed overnight with her BF in a separate room--which is how I know I got lucky! My room was a corner room. I honestly would spend most of my day in the room. I was too sick to go out and my friends were working during the day and having lived there I had no need to go explore, I mainly had dinner dates with friends. My room was very large for Amsterdam and I worked in an industry that had used almost every hotel in Amsterdam for events and seen the insides of most hotels. NH City Centre was where I felt was best for me. As stated, the room was huge and nice and had a very comfortable bed, ample desk, closet space and a nice bathroom. I thought the staff were great too, very international and I speak a lot of languages so I would go from Italian to Spanish to Dutch etc and they liked me a lot--I think coming in and speaking to two of them in their native languages (one Dutch) and asking for a good room helped. Now to tell you why I know I got lucky my friend and her boyfriend came and they came together and after a day of walking through the city (he is from Belgium) we went back to their room--WOW WHAT A DIFFERENCE! They had a tiny white boxy room. My room looks just like the room in the photos but I learnt those are the corner rooms ONLY. They also have parking BUT charge a lot for it according to my friend. I showed them my room and they were shocked to see the difference. As for dining-it is overpriced and small portions but decent in taste. Rooms Service, which I did need at the beginning when I was really not well, was ok but not great and it too was overpriced and came very basic-like if you order a salmon expect JUST the salmon not anything with it, you will have to request vegetables or something separately. The staff were really nice but I think that could be because I spoke to them in their languages respectively and they appreciated that-this is something the Dutch specifically love because they are very unaccustomed to having anyone speak Dutch and knowing I came with a non-Dutch passport but spoke Dutch impressed them a lot. BUT regardless they do go out of their way to help you. The internet is a nightmare. You have two choices--you can go downstairs and get these vouchers which give you FREE internet in the lobby or you can stay in your room and get the same wifi at a fee--go figure! All in all I would recommend it, especially if you can butter anyone up to give you a corner room.

We booked directly on the hotel website with an advanced purchase discount rate. We were 3 adults and had requested a room with 3 single beds, which we got. The room was surprisingly large, especially for European standards. Plenty of room to move around. Bathroom was simple but a good size. Plentiful hot water in the shower and amenities were refreshed daily (we were there for 3 nights). Bedding was very comfortable, good TV with good selection of channels. Flooring is all laminate floors, so no carpets. We didn't find our room to be exceptionally noisy (we were in Room 151). Our room did not face the street so that helped. There was occasional hallway noise, but nothing out of the ordinary. I'm a pretty light sleeper but had no problems with noise. Very clean, comfortable. Safe in the room which worked fine. I would not recommend this hotel if you're looking for luxury - but if you're looking for a dependable, clean, and comfortable room, this is more than adequate. We would book again in a heartbeat. Only slight concern is that the ventilation in the room is minimal\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 our window did not open and there is no adjustable thermostat. Travelling in winter we found the temperature was comfortable (perhaps a little on the warm side). There is a computer in the lobby for guests to use (with internet and printer). Location was absolutely perfect for exploring Amsterdam. We could walk to almost anywhere we wanted to go, and were with a couple of blocks of many tram lines. Centraal Station is about a 15-minute walk. Around the hotel are plenty of cafes, restaurants, and pubs. It's on a very typically-Amsterdam street. It backs onto the Singel Canal, which is picturesque as most canals in Amsterdam are.

Had seen other rooms that were much nicer than our in regards to layout and space. Jennifer (trainee), Jill and Josh on the Front desk were just wonderful staff. Location is what makes this place. You can walk to all interesting tourist sites. Restaurants and cafe's galore. Beware, DO NOT GO to the Itallian Restaurant on the corner, Caprese, very overpriced and the portions were so small, I went away hungry. Service was awful, the waiter tried to charge us for our second glass of wine which we ordered and never did receive. The waiter was quite the smarty pants character not trained well at all. The \"Five Flies\" gourmet restaurant next door was just okay for us. We ordered a bottle of water never received, a half hour later the waiter asked is we wanted water on our table, we said no as we were half way done our dinner. Meal was nice presentation but again portions small. We had asked for the hotel special meal with the special price and was kind of given the impression that was not the thing to ask for. They did change the choice for us as we did not like the Guinea Fowl on the menu. Beautiful restaurant but pricy. The restaurant Haesje Claes across the street was a very nice, nice small rooms with very good service. We had the menu for 22 E and was very satisfied with the meal, typical Dutch meal. Humphrey's more modern restaurant, set price menu for everyone 23.50E good selection and the service was good and the food nicely presented. We also ate at a Rancho restaurant on a side street, good meal and a great price per person, menu once again. For lunch we stopped at a little Italian restaurant, (ll Palio) in the Leidsekruisstraat street, very old place, pizza was 5E, pasta 5E you couldn't go wrong. The pasta was almost twice the size of what I paid 14E for on our street and much more tastful. Went to the Windmill and beer brewry. Great place. Open from 3pm until 8pm daily. Recommend you sit at the bar inside talk to the bar tenders and people watch. We stayed for a couple of hours and it was alot of fun. Staff are great. Beer average price but you have to see it to believe it. Look it up on TripAdvisor to find you way there. Easy by tram. Down from our hotel was the Brown Bar Hoppe is a real beehive in the evenings and the bar itself is just beautiful inside. The cafe next door is also a pleasant place to stop and have a few pints and people watch. Went on a tour booked through the hotel. Tour company name was Lindbergh. The tour was Volendam, Marken and Windmill Village by bus and boat, 5 1/2 hours leaving at lpm in the afternoon. The tour guide spoke perfect English, Spanish and Itallian, nice and loudly for all to hear. That was the end of the good part of the tour. We left early, which was nice, arrived in Marken with another larger tour arriving at the same time to see the wooden shoe maker and shop. We had to wait outside till they finished. Half our group didn't listen and went in with the other tour. We went next and again two gentlemen held up the whole tour shopping and came out with nothing. We walked through the town, our guide never said one word about the town but went straight to the boat dock we boarded and off we went to Volendam. Arrived, nice boat ride, and we walked down about l block our guide told us to meet back here in l hour 20 minutes, have lunch and then we would do a walking tour and go to a museum. We had lunch, waited once again for everyone to arrive, walked through town, not one word from the tour guide about Volendam, entered the museum just before they were closing. There again was no information orated only pictures and things for you to read. We came out our guide couldn't find our bus. It was no where to be found. The other tour group gave us their bus to go to the Cheese Factory as it was close. Our bus showed up after we were all loaded and ready to go so he followed us to the factory. Cheese presentation was a talk as the factory was not operating. The fellow was very informative but again it was short and then we all herded into the shop to taste and buy cheese. We had to wait for the other tour to finished at the factory as we were taking a couple of their people on our bus, why not sure. Wasting our time once again. Off to the Windmills, and Village. Windmills, not operating, Village was closed, Even the bathrooms were not available. Our guide once again did not give any information about the windmills stayed by the bus and waited for us to come back from seeing really nothing. Disappointing for many people as they thought they would tour, or at least see a windmill in operation. I did speak to the guide and told her how disappointed we were in the tour. Her lack of information about Marken, Volendam, Museum, Windmills, and lack of control of her tour. To us it was a bus and boat ride not a tour and for this we paid 37Euro. The only talking she did was when we were leaving the Windmills and she described how the area once was under water etc. A talk the lasted maybe 4 minutes and that was it. Very poor guide, smoking constantly while waiting for us at each location, (not appropriate). We did find out if you go on the tour in the morning you do get to see the village and the Windmills in action and for 32Euros. Too bad no one told us that from the beginning. Our hotel did not know this either. Save your money go on your own if you can. It will be much more enjoyable. The plus was we met some very nice couples and also a couple of very rude men. The breakfast in the hotel is expensive but so are all the hotels for breakfast, there is a large choice and the convenience of not having to run out to find a place is worth it. Book your hotel bed and breakfast and it is cheaper for your meal. Staff in the restaurant again were very friendly and very efficient. Lobby computer access was very good, they could use one more computer and let you have abit longer. You get 15 minutes and it takes almost 3 minutes to log on. But it is free and that is good. Get you free ticket at night for the next morning as it can be very busy at the front desk with people checking in and out. We left to early for our paid for breakfast on the last day, but was given a picnic bag to go with fruit, juice and sandwiches, very nice touch, thank you.

It is about a 20 minute walk from Amsterdam central train station, but so are the majority of the city hotels I guess. The hotel does not look to be much from the outside. However when you enter it is a nice surprise. The lobby is very nicely decorated with wood panelling. When we arrived, Christmas decorations were on display again nicely done and not at all tacky. The staff are very helpful and speak excellent English. If you require help or directions asking at the check-in desk is a great idea. In addition the lobby has a display stand with a number of advertisement cards for the local tourist attractions. The majority of these cards provide money off or free gifts. For example we used the card to get 5 euro off the entrance fee to the Torture Museum. The standard rooms are extremely pleasant. They are quite spacious and nicely decorated. Ours had a fridge, satellite TV with many English speaking channels, and tea/coffee making facilities. The standard rooms only have a shower, although ours was a very large shower. We were also provided with soap, shower gel and shampoo (all smelt of oranges and were quite pleasant). The rooms also feature one way window blinds and a radiator with adjustable temperature settings. WIFI is available, however it is a little expensive and costs 10 euros for 24 hours. However a computer in the lobby is available for guests to use for up to 15 minutes free of charge. If you find that the pillows provided in the room are not to your taste, then it is possible to contact reception and they can provide you with new pillows to your own taste (soft/fluffy/hard). However I do not know if this is a service for which you will be charged. Breakfast was great with a good selection breads. In addition to hams, chesses and preservatives. Bacon, Sausages and Eggs(boiled and scrambled) were also available as well as fruit juice and water. During the evening a bar is opened, however we did not visit so I do not know how much it costs. The location is good and generally within walking distance to most sights. It is close to the main shopping streets so if you fancy doing some shopping it is handy. H&M, River Island, Mcdonalds, Department stores and Subway are all close by. If you do plan on sight seeing, I would strongly advise that you get a city map from the hotel reception, it has all of the main sights marked on and the hotel can mark the location of fast food places and the hotel. We used ours to navigate to each of the sights, so it came in very handy, without it we would no doubt have become extremely lost. The only downside is that on arrival you are required to give a credit card number in, or to pay a 50 euro deposit to cover and costs that you may incur whilst staying there e.g. for using the mini bar or making phone calls. However when you check out you are given back the 50 euros you paid. If you plan on staying in Amsterdam and want a very central hotel within reach of almost all sights, then I highly recommend this hotel.

Finally, the staff are Brilliant. Everyone from cleaning staff to reception and above had a warm smile and were always attentive and happy to help. I cannot rate their service highly enough.

Prior contact with the hotel, ensured that when we arrived they had \"upgraded\" us to a superior room and arranged flowers and sparkling wine (at a cost!) on our arrival. A superior room just means that you get a view onto the canal and a slightly larger room, compared to standard. However, they are not that big to start with, and only have showers. Which don't have quite the same effect when all you want to do is soak in a bath after walking all day. The easiest way to describe NH City Centre is simple:- it's somewhere comfortable to sleep at night. We came to look at Amsterdam itself and not spend time in the hotel, and the hotel's location is brilliant for doing this. Arrive at Central Station, buy a \"strippenkart\" and then get the 1,2 or 5 tram to Spuis, walk round the corner of the street and there's the hotel. From there, you're right next to the flower market, and then walking distance to everywhere nearly. In fact the longest walk we did was to the Van Gogh Museum and that took 25 minutes at most. We paid only for the room, as there is a cafe on the canal side of the hotel that does huge breakfasts, and a pastry shop on the street side and both are better value for money. The only problem when we were there was that the hotel bar was shut for works being carried out, but seeing as though the hotel is on the same street as about 15 cafe's and \"coffee shops\" it really wasn't a problem. Oh and if you like cocktails and mexican food I would recommend Los Pilones, Kerkstraat 63. A tiny little restaurant, where the food is OK but the cocktails particularly the Margaritas are large and potent, you even get a little jug to top it up with!! all for 6.95 Euro.

I had tried to request a canal view but they don't have any twin rooms overlooking the canal unfortunately.

We booked Anne Frank House on the internet and whilst everyone else had a good few hours wait we walked straight in at the allotted time - and the same for the Van Gogh museum. There were other museums we didn't go to that also had queues. I would also recommend if you're planning on seeing a lot in Amsterdam that you look in to getting an I AMsterdam card (you can look it up on the internet). You pay 48 euros each for a 48 hour period and then get free entrance to museums and discounts in restaurants etc. We worked out that between us we spent 96 euros on the card but in total saved 260 euros so a net saving of 164 euros. As Amsterdam is such an expensive place this was a welcome saving! Lastly I must recomment Pasta e Basta restautant. It really was one of the best restaurants I have been to.

I find it very difficult choosing hotels and spend hours looking for the right one wherever I visit in the world (and I've been to over 40 countries) I believe that the following review will tell you exactly what to expect at the hotel and it is fair Advantages: 1. Central Location: The location couldn't be better. All the sights are nearby, coffeeshops, wax museum, anne frank house, bars and restaurants etc. 2. Rooms are clean with an average tiled bathroom and a wooden floor in the bedroom area which is spacious. In no way is it the most stylish room that you've ever seen, but its comfortable. 3. Smoking rooms ARE available (it took me ages to find this out about hotels in amsterdam). Most hotels do not have any smoking rooms and are entirely smoke-free 4. TV channels are good. BBC1 and BBC2 are available at no extra cost. Pay TV is also available. 5. Reception and staff are very friendly and very helpful. Customer service is great in amsterdam anyway, spoken english is perfect and the dutch are very friendly everywhere. 6. Suitcases and bags can be left at reception for no extra cost 7. Check in is at 3pm however we found that after 12 noon, you can return to the reception desk and ask if the room is ready. You will be checked-in promptly. 8. Check out time on a sunday only is 5pm! Pretty good if your trip ends on a sunday and you have a late flight to catch 9. There is a cafe (didn't use it though ... burgers and chips kinda food) Disadavantages: 1. The breakfast is expensive - its 17 euro each and is not included in the room price unless specifically asked for and I found that the breakfast is actually 22 euro each if booked as part of the room price. Eat out instead - O'Reillys Irish bar nearby does a cracking hot breakfast for 10 euro or one of the many cafe's also nearby sell coffee for 2 euro and a pastry for the same. 2. Internet charges are amazingly expensive!! Yeah there is WIFI but you have to pay for it. 17 euro for 24 hours or 10 euro for an hour. Download speed is poor anyway 251 kbps and upload speed is 250 kbps so watching your favorite youtube videos or a streamed movie (to beat the pay tv) is out of the question. Again, go to o'reillys bar which is nearby the hotel, WIFI is free. Ask the staff for the username and password. You will get 1 hour free, then buy another drink and get another free hour if you like. 3. The bathroom shower is nice, but it is over the bath tub with a small shower screen. Prepare to mop up the water from the floor after having a shower with a nominated towel of your choice. The water gets everywhere. 4. The minbar has two bottles of water - still and sparkling at 2.50 euro each. Buy stuff in the supermarket and use the mini bar fridge iinstead. 5. There is tea/coffee making in the room, but not much selection. 6. There is no air conditioning. In november why would you need it? Well it would be good to have it as a heater. The room has central heating only and is controlled by the hotel. So at night it can be pretty cold. 7. And finally my number one pet hate about hotels in europe - Two single beds pushed together to make a double! In some hotels the base of the bed is a double with two single matresses. Not here - its actually two singles pushed together and if there is any action (say no more) on the bed, a chasm will appear when the two beds move apart - quiet funny in the situation, but very uncomfortable to sleep over if you and your loved one like to cuddle at night. You both end up on one single because who's going to sleep over the middle bit :( Hope this helps....", "Date": "November 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "ri_ra_2004", "ReviewID": "UR21309193", "Content": "Great location, not far from anything, but a quiet location.", "Date": "October 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Zurich, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cFine location - very clean rooms\u201d", "Author": "pastaS", "ReviewID": "UR21129643", "Content": "- The location is excellent.

This should not be confused with the NH City Center. I initially went to the wrong one because the tram I was on (No. 1) was passing the other one. It's only a short walk to the other branch, but if you are with lots of bags or it is raining, it is not much fun. So best thing is to go by address - not hotel name. In fact Amsterdam is littered with NH hotels! - The rooms are really very clean, albeit a but small. However, I was on the 5th floor and had an excellent view over the roof-tops of the city. - Unlike the bedroom, the corridors are really somewhat sleepy. The carpets are worn-out, for example. However, if this does not bother you, then the nice rooms make up for the tired hallways. - The front desk was friendly and receptive. - There is no iron & board in the bedrooms. Instead, you have to use an ironing room on the 3rd floor. Would have preferred something in my room - but can not complain too much, since the ironing room was easy to access.

BOOKING AND CHECK IN Booking online was simple via the hotel's website and a confirmation email received. Check in was quick and polite (though it was late on a Thursday night). Reception staff spoke perfect English (as does everyone in Amsterdam). Don't be confused with NH Hotel Amsterdam Centre - a different hotel. The photos on the website are accurate. ROOM AND BATHROOM We booked a superior room @ 140 euro per night room only. It was reasonably spacious - approx 20 feet x 15 feet. I requested a top floor room online as I thought there might be traffic noise and received one. No traffic noise and great view across rooftops and the canal. 3 large windows letting in plenty of light, but with thick curtains and blinds to block out early morning sun. Modern minimalist decor in whites/creams/browns, white duvet cover. Large bed, at least a queen size. Tea and coffee tray. Fake wood floors. TV which worked fine. Phone which we didn't use. We didn't attempt any wi-fi/internet. Room service available but we didn't use it. In room electronic safe which worked fine. Range of lighting including reading lights on each side of the bed. Daytime temperature was around 18-19 celsius during our trip and the room was comfortable - I didn't notice it being either too hot or cold and can't recall using the air-con controls as a result. Reasonable size bathroom but not huge - approx 9 feet x 10 feet. Excellent shower. Very clean. Good hairdryer. Good selection of toiletries in NH's own range - inc shampoo, shower gel, toothbrush sets, shoe polisher, mini body sponge/scrubber, soaps, shower cap. Nice soft white towels - not super luxury ones but similar to ones I would use at home. No bathrobe/slippers. OTHER SERVICES No iron and ironing board in the room, but ironing room on 3rd floor. Vending machines for soft drinks and sweets/crisps on each floor. Lifts worked well, never waited long. On Sundays there is a FREE 5 PM CHECKOUT! You just need to advise the day before that you wish to stay. LOCATION Fantastic and lovely area for wandering all round the Centre, cafes, bars, and the shopping area of Leidesplein. 1 minute walk to the tram stop, which takes you direct to Central Station (1.60 euro single, pay on board). Otherwise approx 8 euro taxi to Central Station. At least a 30min walk to Central Station. OVERALL If you want a good quality, clean, mid-range, modern, chain-type hotel that does what it says on the box with no problems, this is a good 3.5 star choice.

Had a great time staying at the NH Amsterdam City Centre. Rooms were spacious, especially for Amsterdam, and heating was excellent - it was absolutely freezing and snowed for 3 of the 5 days we were in the Dam. Hotel is situated very close to the city centre and transport links are excellent. From Schipol airport, we got the train directly to Centraal Station (costs approx \u00c2\u00a34 each). Jumped on a tram at centraal station (i'm sure its 1, 2, and 5) and got of at the Spui, which is just round the corner from the hotel. We had priced the transfers through the hotel out of interest on our return and were quoted 20 euros, so go it alone! Its a good way to find your way about as well. Our room looked out on a street - Spuistraat. From what i have gathered from others, it is easy enough to get the room switched for a canal view though if you want to. To be honest, we were not fussed. We spent most of our days and nights out and about, and we only really slept in the room. The rooms are spacious though, the bathroom was a good size (a shower big enough for two anyways) and the beds are really comfy. We were up early twice during the stay, to go on trips, and had breakfast in the hotel. At 18 euros per person (buffet style), its a bit steep, but they had everything you could have possibly wanted from crepes, cereal, bacon, sausages, croissants, etc. The other mornings we headed down to the main centre and found something there, which was a lot better priced. Everybody goes to Amsterdam for different things. We really enjoyed our time there and made the most of the things on offer. We did find that eating out and drinking was more expensive than we thought it would be. However, it is a city so these prices should be expected. A few things we would recommend - Casi di David - a lovely italian restuarant which faces onto the Singel Canal (at the back of the hotel - only about 2 min walk away) - lovely food, reasonably priced. - If going for a smoke, the Stone's Cafe is a great place to go. - We went on a bike tour one afternoon. We had a tour guide called Peter who took us round the city on these granny bikes and got us cycling through red lights. We had a great time, though we were slightly under the influence!

A little alleyway over were the tram stops, which, once we figured out how to take them, was very convenient. From the tram stop, it's only about two or three stops away from Leidsplein, a fun area with more restaurants and shops. The hotel is very close to the Spui Square, which had a few bars, coffeeshops, and restaurants nearby. The street the hotel itself is on has great restaurants: of note, an Indonesian restaurant across the street called Kantjil (definitely try the Rijstaftel) and a Dutch restaurant directly across the way (can't remember the name) that had delicious traditional Dutch food. In terms of things to do, Dam Square is about a 5 minute walk, with several shopping streets close as well. Magna Plaza is a nice shopping center to check out. When we travel, we love to check out the supermarket, so stop by an Albert Heijns store! The room itself was simply furnished with a modern color scheme. We had room 503 which was sort of awkwardly wedged in a corner, but the room itself was not cramped. There were tea making ammenities, a bottle each of still and sparkling water for purchase, along with a minifridge (no minibar in there for us though!). The bed was really comfortable. We never checked out their \"pillow menu\" but thought it interesting that it was an option. The bathroom was nice. My fiance's concern with hotels in Europe is that the shower stalls (or curtains) are claustrophobic, but we had no problem here. Their stall was basically just a glass partition from the toilet, with ample space to slip under the shower head. (We liked it so much that we were thinking to remodel our bathroom similarly!) They have their own line of colorful green and yellow toiletries (though I didn't really care for its fragrance), along with a comb, brush, loofah, sponge, and sewing kit. Their breakfast buffet was superb! There was a great assortment of rolls, cold cuts, cheeses, fruit and juices, yogurt, along with bacon and sausage, scrambled and hardboiled egg, tiny pancake bites, even apple pie and spanish tortilla! Sounds funny, but my favorite part of breakfast was their coffee machine. You put a little cup underneath, press the cafe au lait button, and it's the best coffee to start your morning! I think I've covered the basics, or rather the most important points. There is a computer for internet access in a corner of the lobby.

I've paid a similar amount for much less (see my review of the Hotel Nes here on TA). First off, the building itself is huge...Again, by Amsterdam standards. It's as if someone plunked-down a 'big city hotel' into the middle of Amsterdam's usual narrow/labarynthine walkup buildings, though you wouldn't really know it from the outside. A large lobby, a restaurant (which I never tried...17 Euros for breakfast is just too much to pay, especially considering that I found a caf\u00c3\u00a9 right next door that has a perfect breakfast 7 days a week for about 10 Euros.), a similarly-massive lounge, and two full-size elevators (again...rare for central Amsterdam hotels). The location is excellent: A five minute walk to Dam Square, and about a twenty minute walk to either the train station or, in the other direction, the Leidseplein. The Spui tram stop is about 50 yards away from the front of the hotel, just around the corner from a (great) bookstore across the street. There is pay internet in the lobby (forgot the price), or for 10 Euros, you can purchase a password for 60 minutes of wifi (non-continuous over 24 hours, which is kind of handy). The staff I encountered were very friendly and efficient. My room was in the rear of the building, with a canal view (!) Rooms at the front will look out onto Spuistraat, which is full of pedestrian traffic day and night. Quiet and comfortable, a good bed, TV with Dutch channels and BBC. The bathroom was actually better-appointed than more expensive hotels I've stayed at, with quality soaps and such from some Spanish company whose name I forgot. As I'm a guy, I didn't delve too far into it : ) No individual air conditioning per room, but not once was I uncomfortable...Although it was kind of chilly and rainy, even in late June.

Went to Amsterdam for Queens Day this year which was excellent fun, so the hotel and the whole of Amsterdam was extremely busy because of these celebrations but this did not effect the level of service at this hotel. Stayed in room 357 this year, the room was spacious, clean and of good condition, the view wasn't too great but the room is situated at the end of hotel building between the main street & the canal so it was perfect on this occasion as I requested a room away from the from street & the canal to avoid be disturbed by the partying that would be going throughout the weekend for Queens day and sure enough, we weren't disturbed so it was fine of this occasion to sacrifice a view for peace & quiet instead. Last year stayed in Rm 352 which faces the main street, this room was more spacious than 357 and of course had the view of Spuistraat St which was lovely. Both rooms were of good condition with tea/coffee making facilities, clean and had a modern style. Didn't have breakfast in the hotel during this stay but did try it last year when I was feeling lazy on my last morning so couldn't be bothered to go out for Breakfast, plus the bakers was closed (on Sundays). The breakfast is expensive but it was enjoyable and there are plenty of hot/cold choices to suit all tastes & preferences. However, I would recommend that you go to the local bakery called Croissants which is about 25 yards to the left of the front of the hotel. They serve very tasty, pastries, crossiants, pizza style rolls & pastries, freshly made rolls & yogurt drinks, excellent value for money and very yummy. Usually go buy my breakfast there and go back up to the hotel to have a coffee & eat my breakfast in the room before going out for the day. As all the reviews state this hotel is situated is such an ideal location, it's close to all the attractions but not too close to be effected by the noise of the crowds etc. The hotel is a modern contempary hotel, with very efficient, professional, helpful staff. The rooms are of good condition and are generally quite spacious, however I have seen that they do have some smaller double rooms so do request a bigger room, if required. You can ask for as much tea/coffee etc as you want, just go to reception and ask for more when your run out. Would always recommend this hotel to anyone going to Amsterdam and I would definitely stay there again on my next visit which will hopefully be real soon. P.S - Very nice restaurant to the left of the front of the hotel about 50 yards called Novembers - have eaten there twice, both times food & service was excellent and excellent value for money, not expensive.

Checked into our room small, but perect view of the Singel Canal, room was clean and had everything we needed. We opted for the buffet breakfast-not cheap @ 17 euros but worth every cent as we didnt bother with lunch. Hotel in walking distance to the Rijk and Van Gogh museums and Hard Rock Cafe(about 20 mins) . Ten minutes from the Anne Frank House- a must for everyone- I would advise you to read the book before you go if you havent already. Allow 45 minutes queuing time it was the busiest attraction in Amsterdam by far. We bought a day pass on the canal bus and received slightly discounted tickets to the Van Gogh museum. The boat bus pass lasts for a day plus carries over until noon the following day. They have a great free map of Amsterdam behind reception. I used the internet once I wasnt asked my room number so I am sure I could have used it on an other days if I had wanted to. We opted to eat at the November restaurant on Friday night which had a set menu with quality food, with a good choice and very friendly, efficient staff. We made use of the little discount cards we found in the reception area for some of the attractions, including the Dungeons which was not cheap but a fun experience. All the staff in the hotel were friendly especially the barman who created a lovely cocktail for me!

There were various shops off the Spui in a predestrianised zone as well as all kinds in the '9 Streets' location. The Abraxis coffee shop is along the Spuistraat, where we had a small amount of the Hash Brownie Cake (which an hour later made us both feel relaxed). The staff were friendly and helpful. An Irish pub is just off Spuistraat which served up a great Steak & Guiness pie. Other sights we visited were the Museums, Red Light Area (preferred the daytime than the evening to visit) and department stores. Also worth doing is the candlelight cruise.

I expected lots of traffic noise or lobby noise, but there was none. The room was very clean and spacious. I had hoped for a king or queen bed, but they pushed two doubles together. Not quite the same, but still very comfy. The bathroom was large, shower pressure good, and there was a toilet in the main bath and a half bath as well, which was a nice surprise. The lobby staff was very friendly and helpful, even though they were always busy helping customers. The best part of the hotel was the location. I can't say enough good things about it. We walked all over Amsterdam and this location afforded us that opportunity. It was less than a 10 minute walk to Dam Square, Red Light Distict, Anne Frank Haus and no more than 15 minutes to the Rembrandt museum, where we caught our bus tours each morning. The walks were beautiful each morning and we truly enjoyed all of the shops and restaurants along the canals. Also, two of our favorite dining experiences were right next door to the NH hotel. The Five Flies is a must do for any trip to Amsterdam. Bar none - best dining experience ever. A close second was the Indonesian restaurant, Kantjil & de Tijger. Great outdoor dining and an explosion of tastes in the sampling style of entrees. The only drawbacks - there was no air conditioning in the room and they ran out of ice in the ice machine 5 out of the 6 days we stayed. They did bring a fan to our room, but it was unseasonably hot in July and the fan offered little relief. I was able to go to the lobby bar for ice, but it was inconvenient.

The only con i have is the smallish rooms. It's enough for 1 person, but a bit crowded for 2. If you have two pieces of big luggage it's a problem. Definitely the rooms are smaller than those i have stayed in other hotels during my other business trips. Another thing i liked is that only hotel guests have access to the rooms. You need to swipe your key card on the elevator before you can press the floor where you are staying. This is an added security feature i suppose since hotels in Europe usually don't have security personnel unlike most hotels in Asia (too expensive probably). But it's clean, well maintained and conveniently located. The tram stop (Spui tram stop) is only a minute away (by foot).

Initially we thought it might be disappointing. It is located in the University district and the external facade looked mundane and the entrance lobby could best be described as \"stylish, but slightly old-fashioned\". However, we soon learned that intitial appearances can be deceptive. The rooms were spotlessly clean and we loved the decor. However, what really impressed us were the gems behind the reception desk. All the staff seemed exceptionally well trained, were fluent in between two and four languages, and seemed to give the impression that they were there to be helpful rather than to pass the time of day waiting for a pay cheque. The location was central, and therefore close to shopping and within walking distance of all the major attractions - including the more distant Van Gogh museum. Central shopping was just across the road and through a side street. And Dams Square was just up the road. Being close to the University there were lots of cafes and restaurants on the doorstep. The one disappointment with the hotel was the standard of the room service food. The lettuce was going brown at the edges and the burger was black. Pity the catering that we saw didn't match the front of house skills. Perhaps it was a good thing that breakfast wasn't included in our tariff and we opted to go to a local cafe instead.

The main reason for my choice was the good location. We\u00c2\u00b4ve got a little bit disapointed arriving at the hotel, knowing we will spend 2 nigths at a 5-star hotel. The reason was that we saw photos of the hotel online, which obviously shows rooms, entrances and halls we didn\u00c2\u00b4t see being there. Tip: never act in accordance with picutres in brochures or online websites. Behind the window we saw the hotel\u00c2\u00b4s backyard with its noisy aircondition facility.

Fortunately we didn\u00c2\u00b4t have a room in the 1st or 2nd floor as the noise would be more bothering.

TIP FOR CAR TRAVELERS: As the hotel does not have an own parking area, you have to park at a park block 100m away. 24h of parking will cost you 36 euros. Parking blocks in the center of Amsterdam costs 40 up to 50 euros for 24h. One hour costs 3-4 eur depends on location. Almost the same price you have to pay if you want to park in the streets.

In fact, it more than sufficed because there were no bedbugs or leaky ceilings or other mishaps! The bathroom only had a shower. The floor leading to the shower and the showerfloor itself were slippery. They did not have any perma-grit for traction. Other than that, the bathroom was clean and modern. The toilet was a source of endless fascination... The room was clean & fresh every day even though it was a smoking room. Our room faced the canal at the rear of the building. Quite a pretty view but the noise from the obnoxious-sounding scooters at all hours of the day and night can take some getting used to. You don't really wanna shut the windows...but sometimes you have to just to get a night's rest (or a late afternoon nap). The ice is free. There are softdrinks in machines on the 2nd & 4th floors. They each cost 2 euros. That's about what they cost throughout central Amsterdam. The candy machines: Put your coins in first, then make your selection. The candy machine on the 2nd floor stole about 1.60 euros. Use the 4th floor. About one minute away, across the street and down the 1st alley to the right of the Italian Ristorante is Kadinsky Coffeeshop. Good prices and selection. We sat at the front window and got mellow. The other 2 coffeeshops within a minute's walk are to the right as you exit the front of the hotel. You walk past the cafe tables and make a right down the 1st (or 2nd) alley and you'll find Tweede Kamer, and then a few steps away, on the corner, is Dutch Flowers. If you just start walking in any direction from the hotel you're bound to come across a coffeeshop. Behave yourself, be discrete, use your good manners, and smoke much less than you normally would, and you'll have a good time. This is supposed to be a review of the hotel...
