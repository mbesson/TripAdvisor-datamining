Playa Del Carmen is very busy & commerical, so if you stay in the centre, you can expect to be within 2 minutes walk of noise noise noise. This place is a bit away from the centre, so is much more peaceful if you'd like some sleep :). It takes about 20 mins to walk into the town, or you can get a cab to any of the beaches for $2/3 at the end of the road. My fiance & I have been backpacking for a year, have spent 2 months in Mexico & we found this to be the best value place we've stayed anywhere. About the same as a double bed with shared bathroom in a hostel in the centre and here we had a whole apartment to ourselves with the luxury of cooking. The studio apartments are clean and comfortable (great bed), with a free 20l water bottle, cleaning every day, sofa, air con, wifi etc. While I'd disagree with the review below, I do agree it probably depends on what you are looking for and who you're travelling with - if you are expecting a high end hotel or an extensive kitchen in a private apartment, you should probably be willing to pay the big bucks to check into that kind of place - Playa Del Carmen I would imagine that to easily be in the $00s! If you're looking for a quiet, friendly, economical place with the facilities of home, I think this is your best bet. All in all, one of the best value places we've had and for Playa Del Carmen, an absolute steal.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWe ended up moving somewhere else\u201d", "Author": "XtinaY", "ReviewID": "UR124488612", "Content": "I say this is terrible, but I think it depends on who you are traveling with and what you expectation is. It was cheap for sure. We arrived and was told (from the website) that you need to take a taxi from the bus station to the hotel. I printed out the map...but turns out none of the taxi drivers (we got 2 taxis) knows where that is. We circled around until the taxi driver went annoyed, so we got off at the corner of somewhere and had to find it by walking. Turned out it's on a road that's under construction and the whole road wasn't walkable at all. Anyway can't blame them for that I guess but if you do go, remember to print out everything you possibly can print. We stayed at the apartment side with my room on the second floor. It's the most basic room I've ever been to. Kitchen with close to no pans and pots, a very basic bed with 2 thin pillows and a sheet to cover. The funny one was the bathroom - I am 5'4 but when I sit on the toilet my feet were dangling....not the exact feeling I expect. The shower was just one corner of the bathroom, with a shower curtain not really big enough to stop me from making a mess. Alright, settled, and walked to Playa Del Carmen. It was almost a 45 minutes walk (we have pensioners so okie we need to walk slower). You need to cross the highway you come to PDC from and keep walking till you get into the town. Trust me, nothing much you can do around the place so you do have to get into town if you need to, say, eat. Also 'sitting by the pool read some books' doesn't exist there since the \"pool\" is not exactly attractive and I don't see beach chair next to it. Well you can't really complain about those maybe since it is cheap....however the woman who showed us around was funny.... 1. Cannot dump ANYTHING in the toilet other than your own output - she said garbage will clean out everyday so don't feel gross....oookkk.. 2. Absolutely no hanging clothes in the room......but I was in a beach area for 7 days and I only had 3 sets of swimming suits - she suggested laundry service. 3. We went for the breakfast and asked for some bananas - she then specified that it's not to be taken outside and needs to be eaten there. I guess I am not used to be reminded like that. 4. She will add you on facebook after you book the place!!! Thanks but no thank you. Well I guess depends on what you are aiming to do in PDC....if you are to relax that's not really for you. If you are to do some diving course you might not want to stay there as well since we had to leave really early just to be at the diving shop at 8....like got up at 7 and rush out to make it on time. So after a few days we moved to another hotel - closer to PDC where we can easily walked back after the countdown....phew. I did read tripadvisor before agreed to this place....and I guess it's just different expectation since some actually do enjoy the stay. I guess I was spoiled from my first time in Cancun in properly resort hotel.", "Date": "February 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stephens City, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Find\u201d", "Author": "Jeanette S", "ReviewID": "UR122867861", "Content": "This is a little gem in Playa del Carmen.

There are two parts to the hotel----a bed and breakfast and an apartment hotel. Both are very nice. We were allowed to look at both parts before deciding which room we wanted. The apartment side is very nice with a grassy area and the room we looked at included a small separate living area with a couch, a small kitchen and separate bedroom. The room was really delightful and clean. We then looked across the street at the bed & breakfast side, the side with the Robinson Curusoe looking house. This is the side that has a small pool and where breakfast is served. We really liked the look of the cabin we stayed in as it had stone walls which felt authentically Mexico. I don't think you'd go wrong with either side. The Apartment hotel rooms are much bigger, so if you're more than two people, this is a great option. Breakfast was very nice...homemade bread each am, jam and butter, fresh fruit consisting of papaya, watermelon and cantelope, cereal and coffee and tea. There is also a very nice common kitchen guests can use if they want to. We did not use the pool as we were busy trying to find a long term place to live. We did rent the bikes, which was just a bit of a hassle as they require a $50.00 deposit and rent the bikes for 100 pesos per week, which was reasonable. Bike locks were included. The hotel is in the neighborhood where the locals live. We found it convenient for what we were doing, and there are many good restaurants close by. There's also a very nice public park nearby. All in all, I really enjoyed this place. The only \"complaint\" if you will is that no one that worked there spoke English. It wasn't a very big deal though, as if we weren't able to communicate, the employees called the owner Vanessa so we could speak English to her. Everyone worked very hard to keep the place clean constantly. I don't think you'll be disappointed with this place!", "Date": "October 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reston, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cIf you want something cheap for many people in Playa- this is good\u201d", "Author": "walkingupstream", "ReviewID": "UR115703307", "Content": "We stayed here for $21 US on our way back to Cancun. We had a car, and that helped, as it took over an hour, up and down Calle 3 Sur to find the place. It's on the dirt part of the road, opposite the highway overpass from the beaches and supermarket, and it says Casa Ejido on the door, not Casaejido. Seems to be in a sketchy neighborhood, but after staying there I suppose it's safe enough. Free bikes to use, and since we had a car, it's not bad to get to the beaches. Playa is not the place for me to begin with, but if I were younger, on a budget, and had 3 or 4 friends to share a room with, this place would be great. 4 beds and a sofa, a bit musty at first, but seemed to clear up after circulating some air. Clean and friendly enough. Kitchenette and spotty wifi. We got a last minute deal on Hotels.com for $21 US, so how can you pass that up? I just wish it were easier to find. Definitely go to the Alux, a couple blocks over on the main road late night for a drink- you ever been to a bar/club/lounge in a cave?", "Date": "July 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brighton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBest place we stayed at in Mexico!\u201d", "Author": "Hattie89", "ReviewID": "UR115541342", "Content": "I arrived in Mexico for a 6 week trip late June to do some volunteering. After a couple of weeks, some friends I met here and I decided to travel to the coast to see more of the Yucatan and we found this place online. Being on a budget, this place looked incredibly cheap for what we were going to get....and it was! It worked out about 20 pounds each (5 sharing) for 3 nights. The place was beautifully clean, with fresh sheets everyday, continental breakfast on the table early every morning, bottled water included, great shower, private jaccuzzi tub in our bathroom and very much appreciated air-con (especially during the mid-July heat)! It was like staying in a home away from home, with a large kitchen for home cooking so we could cut down even more on costs from eating out and our own private fridge. The pool was lovely and refreshing too, and there were rarely any other people using it except for us. The house reminds me a bit of Robinson Crusoe`s, and is located in a very quiet neighbourhood, away from the touristy bars and clubs, but within walking distance of 5th Avenue and the beach. However when it was too hot to walk, we took a bus to the centre (one every 5-10 mins) from the end of the road, for the equivallent of 25p. The staff were brilliant and lovely! However, they don`t speak any English, only Spanish, so I reccommend learning a few phrases. We managed to get by with pointing and hand gestures though. I would advise speaking to the owners directly or via email if you have any comunication issues whilst staying there. They were very efficient in getting back to us and were hugely helpful and friendly. We stayed for 3 nights, but returned after 1 night in Tulum as we missed it so much and decided to stay for another week. The owners also gave us a discount on our room when we returned. I left on Friday and am going back next monday with my friends for a few more nights!

With only 14 suites, everyone got to know everyone and would often gather in the beautiful courtyard in the evening and do potluck or just cocktails together, play music and just have fun. Continental breakfast was always on the table in the courtyard by 7:30 a.m. with coffee, fresh homemade bread everyday, choice of dry cereals and always fruit. The apartments were about a 15 minute walk down the main street to the beach. It was a lovely walk. or you could cab for $2 USD. Large grocery store 3 blocks away. No TV's there, but who needs TV when on vacation. Free wifi, so we had internet. We spent all day at the different beaches or on 5th avenue...but was so nice to come to our home away from home at night. It is located in a quiet residential area away from the bar street.
