We booked two rooms at Hotel La Noce, one single and one double. Both rooms were confirmed to have private baths. When we arrived we found the the private bath for the single room was down the hallway. The pictures of the rooms looked nothing like what the hotel posted - much smaller. The double room had a window that opened to a courtyard that smelled of sewer gas. The bathroom was small and the shower is just part of the room with a curtain that wraps around. There was no airconditioning to speak of and we were unable to leave the window open. The breakfast room consisted of a bar with three stools and some sort of coffee machine. Luckily we were able to find rooms at Hotel Giada around the corner. (Ask for a room in the new section).

The location is good for travellers coming out from train station. Since the hotel is located on 2 nd floor and there is no lift on the ground floor, so it is bit difficult for travellers with heavy luggage. Bascially, we were quite satisfied with room which was clean and air-conditioned. The bathroom is quite good in terms of size and hot water. (The bathroom in Athens' hotel is smaller than it and we can't have continuous hot water for the shower.) The breakfast was a simple Italian style. This is what we expected. However, we can't open the window in our room as there is strong smell of kitchen. We think there are many resturants down to the window.

Room very average. The hotel claims to have air conditioning but it is centralised so you have to ask the person working at recpetion to put it on, they often refused to put it on stating that it was not hot enough (I think that 33 degrees is hot enough to have some form of air conditioning). Breakfast only had lemon tea and was quite basic. The owner/manager was quite rude on several occasions and also quite confrontational, for no apparent reason. One of the men who works on recpetion does not speak english and can also be quite rude. Bathroom was awful - the shower goes into the toilet and there was also quite a bad stench. There was a lot of noise from guests coming home at night. The only real good thing about this hotel is the location. I would not stay at this hotel again.", "Date": "Sep 26, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR527342935", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "bec27"}, {"Content": "not a good stay we stayed in Florence a few nights in July. The La Noce was located in the San Lorenzo district. It cost 90 euros a night. When we got there, the management had moved us to a smaller room and the bathroom was TINY..the shower and the toilet were inches apart. The room was clean, but the breakfast was horrible. You were asked to sit in a tiny room at a bar with no window. The breakfast consisted of one cup of coffee, juice and a croissant. For the price, this was terrible. There was a substandard elevator in the building and only one exit that could be seen. I would not stay here.

We stayed at La Noce for 4 nights, starting 8Jun. In fact, we only stayed at the 2-star La Noce for 3 nights, with the 4th night transferred involuntarily to another lower-rated hotel.We stayed at Room 1 for the first 3 nights, and it's tidy and clean. The nightmare came on the last night when we were asked to changed to a different room. We thought it's going to be a same-class room as we've booked, but the owner sent us upstairs to the 1-star hotel called Regina. The only window to the room opened up into a backyard, and the air that came into our room smell like the toilet (probably because of the nearby toilets). The room was particularly noisy due to 1/ noise of people coming up from the backyard, 2/ the wall was as thin as paper, so you got to hear whatever sound outside your room, 3/ the plumbing was old, and generated loud noise every now and then over the night.Last, but not the least, the room was probably not a legal one. Our room is Room 29, which was not listed on the registration form posted at the hotel entrance.I would not recommend this hotel, mainly due to the dishonest practice of the owner putting us to a lower rated room.", "Date": "Jun 15, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR832207044", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "very good Very convenient location just off S.Lorenzo, staff were very helpfull, the room was very clean, easy walk to all of historic district.", "Date": "Mar 7, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR206775523", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Great service!

It was nothing but frustration the entire time. When we booked the room, we were told that they had a room for us. When we arrived, they didn't have us listed, then had to try to do some shuffling to get us in. Its a long story, but after several problems just trying to get a room that they had told us they had, we decided we would rather stay somewhere else. Then the manager started to threaten us with charging us for the room for the entire four nights if we tried to go anywhere else (we had already mistakenly given them our credit card info), and it quickly escalated into a tense, combative argument with him making veiled threats at us. Being in a foreign country, we finally relented, and agreed to stay there just to stop the fight. Service is extremely important to me, and the way things started left a bitter taste in my mouth for the remainder of our trip. The room was ok; nothing special. They claim they have a/c, but it wasn't working during our stay. The location was pretty good, but there are better for the same price. All in all, it was the only black-mark on an otherwise wonderful honeymoon.", "Date": "Mar 29, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR242330807", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Centralissimo I have used this small hotel several times over the years and have found it to be basic and very clean.
