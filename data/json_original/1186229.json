We booked an appartment with two rooms, one king size bed and other room with two twins. There was also a sitting area and kitchen. Room were very clean. Location was just perfect for a tourist. Hardly 2 min walk and you are into Mall of Emirates entrance gate 1 (near east food court). This mall has also Metro station. Breakfast was good too...

I like to stay in hotel apartments so I found that hotel in the internet. After a few complications we could talk tot the manager about taking an apartment for a year. We verbally agreed on a rate and I paid the first month upfront. About one week before that month was over my wife asked the staff how we can pay the next month. The staff then came back to us and told us we can't stay to the agreed price and have to pay 1,000 AED more. Of course we then moved to somewhere else as this is an outrage. To do business like that is not acceptable and I am disappointed about them. The rooms are not bad (not that big but fully equipped) and the location is excellent right next to the MOE. But the service is below standard (Mr. Froy from reception is arrogant and only if he has a good mood he is talking to customers).

However, the negatives do not overcome the positives therefore I would not stay there again. The room was not fully ready when we arrived and we did say we could just drop bags and come back - we went into the room and it was not totally clean. The bathroom became smelly after the four days, we could hear the floor above us move chairs, the TV etc. There is a noisy building site with constant drilling or generator behind the hotel - get a front room. The breakfasts are inedible - sorry I like warm brown toast. The wifi internet not being free is not acceptable having travelled a lot this has been included in several other similar establishments of similar price and better quality.

Traditional furnishings throughout the hotel which are bright, clean and pleasant. Roof top pool is good, although only 4 loungers and mostly construction views. Nice gym too. Staff are really nice and helpful. I paid \u00a365 a night, incl breakfast, which I thought was really good value for Dubai. It would have been same price even for 2 people. A couple of times I asked for bottled water and there was no charge. There is a little supermarket, turn right out of hotel and about 150 yds on left had side. The only downsides (and they weren't showstoppers) were: 1) the huge amount of contsruction going on around the hotel, 2) apart from Mall of Emirates, there wasn't much within walking distance to do or see, 3) taxis don't know where the hotel is and keep getting lost - on this point, make sure and get a location map from the hotel to show taxi drivers. Things that were good in Dubai: 1. the Atlantis Hotel, especially the Aquaventure Waterpark (and try the new monorail - you can get on at the Atlantis and do a return journey over the 3 stops, which allows you to see the hotel from a great angle on the return journey - takes about 45mins all in. 2. Mall of The Emirates - if you like shopping 3. Trader Vics , restuarant at the Madinat Jumeriah ( a marina, Souk and food place all in one - really nice) 4. La Veranda restauarnt in grounds of Palm Jumeriah hotel.
