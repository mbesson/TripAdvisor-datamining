We had a drink one night in the bar however, drinks were expensive, If they lower the prices and put a little background music on in the bar it would have a better atmosphere, and people would have a tipple before retiring.Staff very helpful and friendly. The hotel within walking distance to the termini 15mins, Barbarini Piazza/Spanish Steps/Trevi Fountain 20mins, however, Vatican 30 mins one way and Colleseum 30mins other direction. but much better walking than taking buses which get stuck in traffic you might as well walk.

The rooms are spotless, comfortable and very spacious, and due to the quiet location we slept soundly even with the window open. The hotel sits just on the outskirts of the Centro Storico, meaning it's within easy walking distance of the Trevi Fountain, Pantheon, Piazza Navona and Campo del Fiori. It's also within 5-10 mins from Repubblica metro station, meaning the Colosseum, Vatican and anything further afield are also very close! One slight negative was the A/C in our room either didn't work very well or not at all, hence the 4 star review. As said, the hotel is in a quiet enough area that you can sleep with the window open, but this will probably be a problem if you're travelling in summer - make sure and ask for a room with functional A/C.

If we wanted an English themed experience, we could have just gone to London. If I were a Brit, it would be the equivalent of me going to another country to stay at hotel Tampa, Florida. Don't get me wrong, there were no replicas of Big Ben, or portraits of the royal family to marr the experience. In fact, the decorations and furnishings were in good taste. What really matters is the location, service, comfort, and how many mini bottles of top shelf shampoo the housekeeping staff will provide before cutting you off. Four in our case. Not bad. Four stars is what we bargained for and four stars is what we got. No complaint there. Nothing too fancy, but nothing spectacular either. The staff were attentive and friendly enough, but I have to downgrade their transportation and tour knowledge. They were close but usually off a bit on most suggestions regarding venue hours of operation, and where to catch a particular bus, or train to get you places. But they ranked well above average for giving directions using their handy dandy tourist map. You don't really need their input on restaurants as they are everywhere and seemingly all good. You can get great service before 8, since Italians generally eat and socialize later in the evening. Prices vary but almost all have menus posted. And yes, it is possible to go a whole week eating almost exclusively pasta and pizza and not get tired of it. Bon appetite! The hotel is located in a relatively quiet mixed commercial/residential area on the eastern edge of historic Rome. A little away from the main sites, but not far enough to be a real inconvenience. We basically discovered you could practically and literally walk around Rome, and only require transportation to get places quicker. If you have two marginally operational legs and kneecaps you could better experience the flavor, sights, and sounds of the Eternal City by walking. NO HEELS LADIES! WOW! The first and only time we took a taxi (to the Vatican, most amazing BTW), the guy must have taken the really really scenic route, because it seemed after some experience that we could have walked the distance in almost the same amount of time. The weather was perfect in Mid March and all we needed was a light jacket during the early morning and evening. Highly recommend the direct transportation private driver service to and from the airport. Well worth the Euro. DO NOT take the metro (Termini) if you have more than a backpack, unless you want a real adventure. Rome is definitely for lovers.

The location is about a 15 minute walk to the closest metro station and after a full day of sightseeing, the last thing you want to do is trek up the hill (especially at night) to get back to the hotel. It is also difficult to find in and of itself - especially when my booking confirmation told me it was on Via Veneto - it is not. The breakfast had too many sweet things (not for me that early in the morning) and not any hot food which would have been nice. There was cold meats and bread and cereal but not much variety. However, it was included in the room rate and you could find something to eat at the very least. Because smoking is allowed in some rooms, the smell drifts a bit but never came into my room so I guess that was fine.

I thoroughly checked the reviews on here before booking our room and was a little mislead by people saying that Termini was just a 10minute walk away and therefore very convenient. We found that Termini is probably 20mins away in the glaring August heat and definitely not the nicest part of Rome to be in at night trying to get back to your hotel. The nearest bus stop is just two minutes away on Via Piave but we found buses do not return to that road from Termini, only go in that direction so in the evenings had to go a little further. Taxis can be pretty expensive so we stuck to the buses and found the easiest thing to do was walk from the hotel to Via Veneto, which takes about 10minutes and from there you can get buses to most of the attractions. The beautiful Villa Borghese is also just a few minutes further past Via Veneto. Like I said, getting back to the hotel at night was unpleasant as no buses go directly to this area so we first needed a bus to Termini and then another from there, I'm sure there is an easier way but that's how we did it. Because of this I did not think I would return here when visiting Rome but the location can be overlooked because of the fantasticly huge rooms! Our room was on the 6th floor and as there were 3 of us we expected a double bed and a seperate single, however, the double was so HUGE that all 3 of us slept in it with room to spare. The bathroom was very clean, well equipped and the shower was exactly what you needed it to be after treking around Rome for the day. The room had lots of space to move around in, with a table and chairs, although like other people have said, tea making facilities would have been greatly appreciated. The breakfasts are ideal if you do not mind missing out on hot food, which I didn't for the first few days but after a while the pastries and cakes can become sickly. You can order eggs etc at an extra price, but not sure its very fair to charge approx \u20ac6 for it! The air conditioning unit in our room began leaking after the first couple of days so we had to be moved which we were really annoyed at...until we found we were being upgraded to a suite to make up for the inconvenience! Again, the room was huge, with a seperate living room and dinning area and we had the beauiful terrace/balcony that you can see on their website. The staff were very helpful, especially the gentleman who helped us move rooms, although there was another older gentleman at reception who seemed out of sorts. The hotel is great value for money, especially compared to the rest of Rome and no doubt if it was situated furter in the centre we would not be able to afford it. When we first arrived at the airport we took the shuttle bus to Termini but on the way back we chose the hotel's car service which was \u20ac45 I think. Unbelieveable comfy stay, hope to return here in June. Would recommend to those who prefer the quite and like generous rooms. We opted not to go for guided tours as they were stupidly expensive (\u20ac50 pp for a 2 hour tour of the trevi fountain and spanish steps?!) so its best to get a good guide book and research bus routes upon arrival.

Booked the hotel and flights via Expedia and got a great deal for a short 3 day trip in Rome. Hotel We arrived at the hotel earlier than expected and earlier than the check-in time of 2pm however the receptionist managed to sort out a room for us which was ready straight away. He also gave us a handful of maps and guided bus tours and pointed out all the major attractions and how to get to them all. The bellboy then took our luggage to our room for us which was unexpected seeing as we only had 2 pieces of hand luggage - still nice though! The staff were extremely helpful throughout our stay - even allowing us to print of our pre-booked tickets to the Vatican for free. The hotel also has free wifi throughout and use of a PC in the massive lobby! The Room We got a room on the 3rd floor which was huge and came with most facilities you would expect/need. The bellboy even helped us set up the in-room safe which was great.The room (other than being huge) was very nicely decorated and modern with a flat-screen TV, telephone, really lovely bathroom (with bath) and two massive single beds! There aren't any tea/coffee making facilities in the room, as mentioned in previous reviews, but we brought along a little travel kettle, tea and cups so managed to get around that. There isn't a mini-bar in the room, instead there is a small fridge which came in handy for the milk (there are quite a few small supermarkets to get the milk from). We didn't really watch the TV much so I can't comment on the channel selection, however we did manage to find Sky Sports which showed a couple of the Premier League games live. The beds were extremely comfortable although only 1 extra pillow is provided in the room - we called for an extra one which was brought up to us pretty quickly though. Food/Breakfast There isn't a restaurant in the hotel but there are plenty of eateries nearby the hotel (highly recommend Trattoria Cadorna - 2 mins walk) and of course in the main sightseeing areas - most don't start serving dinner until 6/7pm. The hotel does offer a small snack selection including omelettes, toasties and things like that though. The breakfast is included in the room price and I have to say that I can't fault it! Yes, it is a continental breakfast - so no hot food - but there is so much cold food on offer that this never became a problem. It is a buffet -style breakfast and so you can pretty much help yourself to as much as you want! Chesses, ham, bread, cereals, fresh fruit, cakes (!), yogurts, juices are all there and are constantly being replenished until 10.30am when the breakfast ends. There are also hosts which come and serve the hot drinks and clear away the tables etc. They are also happy for you to take extra to makes lunches with which I would recommend as eating out around the sightseeing can be unnecessarily expensive! Location The hotel is a little bit out of the hustle and bustle of the main city but still within easy walking distance of the major attractions. 10mins walk to the Termini station where you can get on the Leonardo Express which will take you straight to Fiumicino airport (airport-hotel in less than 1hr). From here you also have access to both metro lines. Barberini metro station is also about 15min walk from the hotel. Trevi Fountain - 20mins walk, Spanish Steps and Piazza del Popolo about 40mins walk or 2 stops on the metro from Barberini. We visited pretty much everything in the 2 1/2 days we were there without difficulty. The area itself is a really nice residential area with quite a few lovely restaurants/trattorias nearby. Via Veneto is also around 10-15mins walk away and is definitely worth a visit - albeit a bit pricey on the restaurant side!

I don't think you can get any higher a compliment, a guy telling his mum whe to stay. I will def be back myself. Thanks to the staff. PS Rome is immense!!!

The doorman (a different one each day) was very helpful and friendly. The reception staff were mostly friendly (as it was my first introduction to Italy I am not familiar with Roman manners or etiquette so not sure if sometimes when I found something as being less friendly it is actually just the Roman way. This theory was reiterated outside of the hotel when smiling to passing Italians and they would just look at me strangely and mistrusting. Don't let this put you off please as this was the minority.). The lobby and bar area was really nice and romantic type decorating and paintings. The bar staff were really friendly and helpful as well. I know no Italian and she was happy to give me a small crash course. Breakfast: I found breakfast interesting, suitable, and so tasty. You get a selection of cold meats (gorgeous), cheese (soft and hard cheese), butters, jams, several types of different roles, cakes and tarts (strangely), fruits, cereals, etc. Also, they do lovely cappuccino. You do help yourself to breakfast and the staff does your tea and coffee but they are so lovely, helpful, and professional. Room: The room was big and so was the bathroom. The bed was huge, possibly the size of 2 double beds put together and comfortable. The TV has many channels but you will be very lucky to stumble on an English one that wasn't BBC or CCN news. (I love coming back to a show or a good movie in bed after a busy day out). The room is very comfortable and does come with a safe. There is also air conditioning (which is turned off during winter which turned out to be rather warm actually but opening the window gave a suitable amount of breeze and fresh air in the room. The bathroom was very good and comfortable and has a bath (with low shower head for washing hair), over bath shower (fantastic water pressure), toilet, bidet, large basin area, heated towel rails. The bathroom was clean apart from some hair on the bidet and on the bath but that could be the cleaner\u2019s hair. The room is very quiet and the room was very clean. When you leave the hotel you do need to give in your room keys though (still keys not the card system which is fine). It is located in a very good area and there are loads of restaurants in the area that are very good. (I thought there was a restaurant in the hotel but it seems not). If you walk out of the hotel and turn directly left and directly left again, walk up this road and keep going, on the right there is a pizzeria and if you walk a bit further on the corner of the next street there is a pub restaurant called Brancaleone no: 170-172 Via Sicilia and they do authentic Roman food. It was amazing and the choice was good. The staff speaks English well and they are happy to make suggestions for you. We had 2 fantastic meals there and one of them they had home made pasta as a special (Sunday night) it was the most amazing pasta I have ever tasted. From the lettuce, tomato, bacon fat fried croutons, and buffalo mozzarella salad to the first course of pasta and the second course of meat dishes, it was amazing. My husband also had a pizza there that was so healthy and delicious. It had the normal thin crust pizza base then covered with leaf, cured beef cold meats and parmesan slices. Delicious. Another good restaurant we tried was in the next street closer to the hotel called Ristorante La Cantinola No: 16 - 18 Via Calabria. It is a fish restaurant (you'll see the live lobsters in the fish tank in the front window at 120 Euros each) but the rest of the menu is not that expensive, the food is great. This is a very Roman restaurant and only 1 of the staff there speak English but that was fine. There was less choice but where the steak was very expensive in the other restaurant, it was very affordable in this restaurant and extremely tasty. Just remember if you like your steak cooked medium, order well done or very well done. In the same road is a brilliant Irish Pub called St Patrick's Irish Pub no: 30 Via Calabria (there must be one in each country), the staff are so friendly and the Guinness is fantastic. The sights are walking distance from the hotel. The Termini station is about 20 minutes walk, the Spanish steps and about the same for Barberini. The Trevi Fountain is about 30 minutes walk back but do yourself the favour and walk around a bit, you see so much more than on the bus. We took the Green Line tour bus from Barberini (one of their stops) and bought tickets at the hotel (they cost the same price really so feel free to buy a ticket at the stop. Tickets were reasonable and you can buy one trip, 24 hour, 72 hour, and so on tickets for the bus. We bought a 24 hour ticket and could jump on and off the bus where we wanted to go see sights and we found this a lot easier as we didn't know where to find the sights anyway and they do give you a bit of information via headphone commentary on the bus. I found the commentary a bit mediocre on this bus as it was either given too late when leaving the sight or at a time when you have already passed the sight that they are referring to so have no idea where it was or what it looked like (from my Blackberry travel app called 'Ultimate Travel Guide' - extremely useful for all the sights, culture and so on - that the reviewer on this app found the same) but there are at least 3 other buses using similar routes that may have better commentary. A lot of the sights were free including the fountains, St Peter's Basilica and the Pantheon. The Vatican City cannot be entered by the public so you can only see St Peter's, go up to the tower dome of the Vatican above St Peter's Basilica (also have the view inside St Peter's) for 5 euro with the stairs or 7 euro with the lift. There are also very clean toilets on these grounds to use free of charge. About a 15 minute walk around the walls of the Vatican to get to the Vatican museum, (I think it was about 15 euro each to go in and decided not to) this includes Michelangelo\u2019s famous ceiling painting in the Sistine Chapel. A word of warning, we got off the bus and walked towards the Vatican and was stopped by one of the many offering guided tours of the sights (you will find this at each historical site) and she offered 80 Euros for 2 people on this guided tour...I think you will find by adding up the 15 and 5 euro it would have cost anyway to see what can be seen around the Vatican the guided tour is rather overpriced. The Coliseum was amazing but the queue here is very long. There are 2 queue's one with guided tour and one without. Standing in the queue, we decided it would be a better option to just pay the extra for the guided tour which means skipping the queue and it wasn't that expensive either...we didn't use the tour but skipping the queue was well worth it. You also buy audio tours from this queue which in hindsight would have been another good option.", "Date": "December 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nagoya", "Title": "\u201cComfortable and Convenient\u201d", "Author": "onthegoNagoya", "ReviewID": "UR121311576", "Content": "We had a regular room and it was enjoyable.

Not even any locals (even though in a built up residential area). When we asked about maybe having a pizza delivered to hotel. They did not know of any Pizza delivery services. How strange is that in Italy. The hotel was very very quiet, few staff and very few clients with no more than 15-20 people at breakfast. No toast/eggs or any hot breakfast, just continental. Apparently they do not have a kitchen is this large hotel. The location was a bit out of the way, 40mins walk to spanish steps and centre, and about 15 mins taxi ride for 10 Euros. Would we stay there again? No. May consider going there again if they put in a restaurant and it is more lively, and not 'dead.' Its a nice hotel if you want all the things we didn't as above.

I booked the hotel because of the good reviews it received and I was not dissappointed. We arrived around 12 and were told our room was not ready yet and the receptionist told us that we could go to Via Veneto for a look which was a few blocks away. We were very tired and waited for our room to be ready. It is in a nice part of Rome with major headquarters of banks and embassies around it. Our room was nice and big room and my only greivance is the lack of a kettle and tea making facility in the room. Rome was mild during the day but quite chilly in the evenings and I longed to have a warm tea before I went to dinner or came back from one. Once I was desperate and bought a takeaway tea in one of the shops nearby and the receptionist looked at me with surprise. I hope he realised that some people like a hot drink frequently.Also this being a four star hotel, I naturally assumed there would be one. Other than that, everything was fine, the breakfast like someone mentioned before was very Italian with lots of Italian pastries but good enough to last through to lunch. the hotel is in a very good location but it can be quite a maze in the beginning. It took us a better part of our trip to get used to the narrow roads but once you get around it is very close to the main attractions by walking and even closer by bus. I would suggest getting the bus map rather than only a map of rome since the bus service is much quicker and cheaper and much better connected to all parts of Rome than the metro. If you're getting a Roma card then the bus and the metro are free but it might not be suitable for everyone so I would encourage a little more research into getting a Roma card to since it costs 25 euros each. The nearest metro is the Bernini which is about 10 mins away and the bus is 2 mins away to all the attractions from via Settembre.

When we returned to the Hotel, our luggage had already been taken to our room. Unfortunately the room we were given, 209, had a large damp patch on the bathroom wall and the whole room smelt musty. We asked for a different room and the helpful reception team moved us to another one, 207. This room was much better, and was very clean and comfortable. We asked for extra pillows, but were told that none were available. This was annoying, as the pillows provided were quite thin, and a second one each would have been appreciated. The breakfast was good, and was very Italian with lots of sweet pastries and cakes. I would advise going early, as it gets quite busy and the tables fill up at the weekend. The Bar was very pleasant, and was a relaxing place to have a drink before going out for dinner. The Hotel is an easy walk from Termini, approx 20 minutes with luggage, but there are taxis and buses which pass nearby. One thing which did cause some irritation was the Roma card. We asked the reception on arrival if they sold this, and were told that it didn\u2019t work and wasn\u2019t worth purchasing, so we took their advice. It was therefore very annoying to see other people using this card successfully both at the museums and the metro system.

When we asked for help about getting to certain locations, they weren't very helpful at all and gave us the bare minium of information. I ended up avoiding asking reception for help because of their horrible manner. When we went up to the reception to complain about a soiled blanket that had been left on my bed, we were met with a frosty reception and not offered any sort of an apology. The room was fine, clean (apart from the dirty blanket) and had air con which was brilliant. Breakfast was average. When we were checking out the staff were again very rude and I was scowled at by one of them, which made me very uncomfortable. Also just a heads up for would be travallers- theres a city tax for tourists staying in hotels, 3e per night. We didn't know this so just passing it on in case anyone else didn't know about it. Also don't ask the staff for any recommendations of places to eat- when we asked we were sent to a very expensive snobby restaurant.

How wrong this was. Indeed, the breakfast was comprehensive (only cold dishes were included) and the rooms comfortable, as would be expected of a \"4 Star Luxury Hotel\" in a major European city. Free wi-fi was a plus. Otherwise, little springs to mind which would suggest such a service. The location is neither \"unbeatable\" nor \"in Rome city centre\", as advertised, a good 15 minutes' walk from the Spanish steps, and 10 minutes from any metro station. Not once did we eat well within walking distance of the hotel. Upon arrival, the reception had great difficulty finding our names on the system, initially making it seem like our fault- we hadn't made a booking for that day. We thought nothing of it, as they eventually sorted it out. The next morning, we were told the Roma passes for each of our party (4 in total) that had been booked and paid for with the rooms were not available, as the city had run out of passes a few weeks ago. This pass offers free use of all transport, free entry to 2 museums and reduced entry thereafter, and usually would cost \u20ac25 each. Again, we were extremely unimpressed with the disorganisation of the hotel, having given them months of notice with an early booking. To appease us, the receptionist offered us 2 baskets of fruit; hard graft to equate to 4 \u20ac25 passes, but better than nothing we thought. On the penultimate day of our stay, with promised fruit yet to materialise, we had to approach the desk to find out what had happened: they had forgotten. Alas, checking out, the greatest fiasco yet. We'd arranged previously with the hotel that we would travel ourselves to a sight close to the aeroport, and at 17.45 a hotel car, with our luggage in, would meet us at said sight to take us to the aeroport. Silly us for not discussing the price, a ludicrous \u20ac95, particularly when the service to the aeroport would have only cost us \u20ac45. By adding under 6km to a 31km journey, we would be charged over double the price. Hotel Londra & Cargill didn't seem to understand such absurdity, even trying to stretch out on Google Maps the 6km. After an hour of stasis, they finally relented and the manager arrived at the desk, who immediately offered to lower the price to \u20ac60. Not entirely happy, but already an hour of our last day in Rome wasted, we relented and left. So we waited at 17.45, just where we were told. And we waited some more. Until at 18.15 we placed this international call to the taxi driver, only to be told he was still in Rome, would be another 45 minutes, and had never travelled here before. Missing our flight had never before seemed such an apparent possibility. And, surprise, when the driver finally rolled up at 19.00, heavily sunburnt, we learnt again the hotel was to blame: they had told him to pick up the luggage from the hotel at 17.45.

Breakfasts consisted of mostly pastries, cereal and ham and cheese sandwiches, with coffee of all varieties, though we heard the waiter say eggs were available at extra cost. It was adequate, though it didn't compare to the lavish breakfasts we had at hotels in Venice or Florence in other vacations. One thing that makes me recommend this hotel is the \"green\" ability in place: electricity is saved by placing motion sensors in the hallways, so lights only come on as you walk through, and each room has a slot where you place a special key when you enter the room that enables the electricity. When you leave the room, you have to remove it, and all the electricity is disabled for that room. The savings must be terrific! I wish American hotels had this. There were several excellent restaurants within a few small blocks, and an extremely popular gelateria is half a block from the door, though it was always overflowing with locals. Main streets are nearby, the Via Veneto is a short walk away, the Borghese Villa and its huge park are very close by, and we comfortably walked to or from most tourist areas in the city, except for the Vatican, which is a bit far.

Rooms very spacious and nice (could have done with a bit of a more effective AC mind you!) and we found reception staff friendly enough. It's a little out of the way, but not as far as it looked on the maps - maybe a 30 minute walk to the Trevi/Pantheon? Breakfast good, all in all I'd recommend it. As another tip, there is a FANTASTIC little restaurant on the Piazza Sallustio. I don't remeber it's name but it is owned by an ex-jockey and there is a picture of a horse in the window (!!). The food and atmosphere was magnificent and very affordable - seek it out!", "Date": "August 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Drumcondra, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Londra Hotel Rome\u201d", "Author": "Vales", "ReviewID": "UR4986264", "Content": "We loved this Hotel It is in a safe and quite area The reception staff were excellent, very friendly and knowledgeable The breakfast buffet was good Juice, Cereal, Fruit, Breads, Ham and Cheese etc The rooms were nicely decorated fresh and clean and the bathrooms a good size for Rome modern and clean We stayed on the 5th floor They have a bar in the lobby and have a light menu available There is shopping near-by, a branch of Rinacentre there is a good Alimentari Wine /Meat, a Veg/Fruit shop and a fantastic Cheese Shop around the corner(ideal for a summer pick-nics) The hotel is within walking distance of the Galleria Borghese/Villa Borghese There is a small number of nice local restaurants, *Restaurant della Mairoi Via G. Carducci* packed with local office workers at lunch time, not much to look at but oh! the food, look for the review from the Times on the Wall or ask for advice at reception as there is one very close to the hotel that is awful, (Al 56) also near-by Wine Bars + a Jazz Bar.

We felt that it was a definite advantage being just outside the centre and it was only a couple of minutes walk to a bus stop to the railway terminal/bus station. There was air conditioning and the towels and linen were changed daily. The reception staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast was a buffet which consisted of a juices, cheese, ham, yoghurt fresh and tinned fruit, rolls and croissants.", "Date": "September 17, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boulder, CO", "Title": "\u201cWould not recommend\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1428885", "Content": "A very nice hotel within walking distance to many of the sites of Rome.
