{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Fantastic Hotel On a one night stop in Tokyo on my way to Singapore I stayed at the Intercontinental Tokyo Bay. The hotel staff was very friendly and the view from the hotel was amazing. As a girl traveling by herself through Tokyo I was a bit nervous at first but the hotel staff was very helpful. The morning that I was there I woke up very early to go to the Fish Market. The concierge gave an overview of the market, called a taxi and gave me the card to the hotel in case I were to get lost I was to show the card to the taxi driver. In the mornings you can get a awesome view of the sun rising over the Rainbow Bridge and in the evenings you can enjoy a relaxing time at the Sunset Lounge while watching the Rainbow Bridge display it's lights. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!", "Date": "Oct 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR856033369", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "YRamos82"}, {"Content": "Fantastic hotel in Tokyo -- great hub for families not only business This is a really nice hotel. I stayed there with family in July 2008. The rooms were HUGE for Tokyo and if you can get a room facing the bay the views are to die for. The rooms are spotless, immaculate and feature those amazing TOTO washlets (look it up ;-). The staff is very nice and friendly and the location of the hotel is close to public transit (Hamamatsu JR stop, taxi, Takeshiba monorail and the Tokyo subway). I can't believe the kind of deal we got for what we paid! I will most certainly stay there whenever I have to pay for my own stay!! (the Westin in Ebisu is also a huge favorite of mine). The only gripes would be to do a low level renovation since the carpet is wearing in places and some parts of the hotel have a dated 1980s look. Also their Grasmatta spa was just a regular guest room with little privacy. The therapists were.....just ehhh (not really anything to write home about).All in all a WONDERFUL place and one that the Intercontinental chain should exploit more to target high end leisure travel (in addition to business travelers). They really have a gem of a place on their hands. The staff were uncommonly nice to our young kids.

Did the research and as expected, rates at Ryokans and hotels were numbingly expensive. Ryokans averaged maybe 7000y -20,000y per person per night(converting to avg Au$70 - AU$200 per person per night), and hotels were quite restrictive in # persons per room (max 2 or 3 with rollaway). With Ryokans, we would most likely be in the suburbs (so allow extra for transport), sharing bathroom facilities, living in a spartan environment - difficult with 2 restless teens. Took a punt and emailed Intercontinental TB after reading reviews, and got a great rate for Tokyo of 17,500y+tax per night hoping that the room would accommodate 4 persons. Err I may have not mentioned that we were a party of 4.Let's see the positives:- Great view of Tokyo Bay: - 17th floor: a huge plus after a long day of sightseeing (being in a country where we can't communicate makes touring doubly exhausting)- Luxe bathroom amenites (and not just one each of the little bottles, but 4 of each item!)/ comp chocolates/ comp plate of fruit on arrival, and again during our stay.- kettle and fridge space (we asked for the minibar to be cleared out - no problem)- Adaptor provided for our stay, extra blankets/ pillows (my son ended up sleeping on the floor as the beds are only double size - but he would have slept on the floor in a ryokan), bathrobes, night kimonos, and standard fare of iron/ board, hair-dryer, daily English newspaper- TV with 3 English channels - you wouldn't believe how appreciative we were of this facility (not available at a Ryokan) after battling with the Japanese language all day- little touches that made the stay that bit special eg fresh flowersin a vase, ice bucket filled daily- Large supermarket (Food Express) about 12 minutes walk (at base of Siodome buildings) on the way to Shimashi Station (more later) 3 Convenience stores within 2 - mins walk: these convenience stores sell products  food at very reasonable prices eg hot dogs at 100y, pasta dishes 360y. Over \u9646 dozen good restaurants in next building (Ferry Bldg)  nearby. There was an exit door to the next building and onto the overpass to the monorail on the 2nd (I think) floor - which we used to avoid the gauntlet of well-wishing staff in the lobby. Also, I was a bit mindful of having 'snuck' 4 of us in the room.Monorail - 3 mins, Toei Metro line (Daimon Stn) 7 mins, JR rail line(Hamamatsucho Stn) 6 minutes, Tokyo Metro line (Shimbashi Stn) 15 mins walk. I mention these different stations because they are all separate train lines that you need to pay separately to take, which go to different areas of Tokyo- stations sometimes intersecting. We made the mistake of buying Tokyo- Metro passes covering our entire stay, to find that they only covered certain stations. I would next time buy single tickets (on whichever line that took us to the destination) and stick to one or 2 areas a day for touring, as we ended up having to buy extra tickets on top of the TM passes, to get us to places that weren't covered. At then at the end of the day walking 15 minutes from Shimbashi to the hotel, rather than pay to goon the monorail (approx 180y ea for 2 stops). Kids over 11 are full price on pub transport. However, Tokyo is super-safe, so there wasn'treally a problem walking back to the hotel late at night - apart fromfailing legs.It would be arrogant to expect English spoken everywhere, but I was surprised at how little was spoken by staff (both in the hotel and in Tokyo as a whole). However, the best person to contact is the person on the phone that dealt with Guest Services: his English was excellent.All up, this is an astonishingly great choice if you are travelling with a small family and want not only comfort and convenience, but good value in Tokyo.", "Date": "Oct 27, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR336961577", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "family-mcbirnie"}, {"Content": "Nice hotel       Awesome views", "Date": "Jul 20, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR961127204", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Ash7777"}, {"Content": "Well looked after at the intercontinental We stayed here for six days on the way to the ski fields of Japan and found it a very good experience.We hired the hotel minivan from narita to the hotel because we had so much ski gear and that cost us $500 aud,the hotel tried to discourage us because of the cost when we booked it,they suggested the bus.Even the minivan takes about one and a half hours.We had two harbour view rooms with spectacular views and they had very good facilities.The lobby restaurant for any meal was very good.The breakfast buffet was especially good. we certainly never experienced any problems with conceirge or the bell desk at any time.I would certainly recommend going to the sumu wrestling which we booked thru the hotel about three months before we went.You can buy very good lunch boxes there and people around us where getting tea and sake delivered. You are supplied with a small area with cushions to sit on and after 3 hours your butt aches. The trick is go later in the afternoon when the higher ranking chubbys wrestle they are more spectacular.The location of the hotel is a little out of the way but riding the trains is a absolute hoot cheap as chips, regular as clockwork and never far to walk to anything. The Sumu is right beside the trainline.A trick for catching the trains is buy the cheapest ticket I think its 150 yen and when you arrive at your destination just before you put your ticket in the turnstile to exit there will be a fare adjusting machine,feed your ticket in ,it will tell you the short fall for the destination your at put the correct money in that it says to ,it will give you back the adjusted ticket and you are ready to exit without a alarm going off.Strongly recommend a trip to Kyoto ,beautiful city ,more relaxed atmosphere.we just did a day trip on the bullet train and then a tour of the temples etc They pick you up at the hotel put you on the bullet [they call them shinkhansen] I think the spelling is right. meet you at the train at Kyoto take you to Lunch do the tour put you on the train meet you at tokyo and put you in a taxi to your hotel.

The room was spacious and decorated beautifully. Bathroom had a separate stall shower and full-sized tub as well as one of those wonderful automatic toilets. One of the downsides for us was communication. Even though front desk staff can speak English, we had a few major issues with them understanding certain requests. Also a major beef was that the concierge desk was never staffed. My hat is off to the bell staff who went out of their way to assist us. Major kudos to Maeda, the bell person who not only took our bags to our room but answered questions regarding sites and then went out of his way to bring us brochures and maps. He even walked us to the nearby monorail station, which would have been a slightly confusing trip if he hadn't shown us the way.

Am an Ambassador level member with the ICH group, but this was hardly acknowledged. The location is okay. About a 10 minute walk to either the JR or the subway line. However, there is hardly anything else around the hotel. You really do have to go off campus in order to get anything. I found the food at the restaurant nearly inedible. The carpets in the common areas were very dirty and the many of the buttons at the elevators and moldings were chipped and well-worn. My room was very nice, but after I asked to be moved. The better rooms have views of the Bay from the bath. These are large and very comfortable. The smaller rooms were very small, and very dirty in terms of the carpet and just well-worn.The hotel needs a good overhaul. It feels like it might have been new and plush in the 80's, but they haven't done anything to improve it since then. Was also disappointed with the concierge service.

Delicious food!The limousine bus service was 3000 yen from NRT airport and took 1,5 hours due to many other stops on the way (we were last on the bus when it finally reached the hotel).

The service was very good, hotel in nice condition.If you like to visit central Tokyo by day (and immerse yourself in throngs of people), then this hotel may be good as an oasis of calm from the hustle and bustle. Yes, its off the beaten track somewhat, but affords great views of Tokyo Bay and the rainbow bridge. Exit the 3rd Floor for the Takeshiba Monorail station (It's not really a monorail, more an elevated train). This will take you to Shimbashi station to connect to every other form of transport you could want.My minor grumbles about this property are as follows: The beds were hard as a slab of concrete, and quite unconfortable. I have noticed this in alot of Japanese hotels. I don't know whether this is because alot of Japanese sleep on the floor on futons/tatami floors, but I found the beds quite uncomfortable. Secondly, the prices for internet access as previously mentioned were steep, especially if you want to use Wi-fi in the hotel lobby after checking out (purchase this service from the Reception). Lastly, the 3rd floor walkway from the hotel to Takeshiba station seems to always be populated by many Japanese workers taking a break from work - all chain smoking. Its a smoky gauntlet to have to run, but you're through it quickly.Good points: The buffets were quite good (as far as buffets in Japan), and were quite tasty. The price was on par for Tokyo and I found the Lunch buffet to be a fairly good value.", "Date": "May 12, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR149850817", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Off the beaten path but wonderful hotel I stayed at the Intercontinental Tokyo Bay on business.

The hotel is beautiful, lovely rooms with great views of the bay and river and Rainbow Bridge. We stayed on the Club floor which included breakfast, drinks, appetizers at dinner hour. The staff was very helpful. We asked for a late checkout and they did not charge us (their standard late checkout charge was 30% of regular rate). This hotel is an excellent value for the money, our rooms were $175US each on the Club floor and were luxurious, beautiful bathrooms. One was a corner room, really nice (of course we gave our 17 year old the other room). One thing to note - while rooms are reasonable, there is extra charge of $18 per day for internet, and a cover charge in the pretty 6th floor bar after 9 PM.My only caveat about this hotel is the location. Earlier in our trip we had spent a week near Azabu/Roppongi section and had become used to being in the middle of things. The Intercontintental is in a quieter location and it is on a monorail line that it one stop away from the subway. Each of these lines has its own charge, which starts to add up. It is however near the fish marekt, and the river cruise is close by (a very worthwhile cruise) However, from this location there was not much you could walk to and not much for our teenager, whereas in the other area he could walk out on his own to stores, etc.", "Date": "Jun 28, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR586732990", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Cambridgtravler"}, {"Content": "Slightly off the beaten path but very fast and easy to get to and from.
