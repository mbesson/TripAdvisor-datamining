{"Reviews": [{"Content": "What a disaster!!! This was my first time in Mexico City and I was on vacation with my family. I really expected to have a wonderful time and to stay in good accomodations especially since the Aristos is suppose to be a four star hotel. Well, it was a mess. For one thing the service was awful. I was locked out of my room one night and I went down to the front desk to see if someone could let me in, well they didn't quite make it up there until over an hour later. I used a phone to call several times and they said that they had been up once but didn't see anyone. The truth is that whoever went up there stuck their head out of the elevator and didn't even look around or call out. I'll never stay there again.", "Date": "May 22, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR679438888", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "I expected more Well, this hotel is really grat located but tha tday I arrived the service was really slow, I had two rooms and the key is of one of the rooms wasn\u9e93t working so I used the other room telephone to call the front desk for a solution, the made me wait for more than 30 minutes and no body helped me, then I had to goto the front desk and I found out that they have decodified my key. Imagine if didn't have another room.Now the bed, the base is smaller than the mattress and due to that the bed moves all the time. No body explains about the water controlls and when you open the water is reaaly hot or really cold.Next day the thing were better because the people that helps hiring a taxi and that kind of thing were nice but I couldn\u9e93t forget the first day.I not trying to say Don't go to this hotel because probabily I just had bad luck, but I am really upset because I paid before arrive, they knew and they gave me bad service. I insist that nex they things changed I was going to leave the room but I needed time to breakfast and the took care of my bagpacks.Please Aristos make it better because you have a great location and I think you have to show your best face.", "Date": "Jul 28, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR670745288", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Great Location The Aristos Hotel has one of the best locations in Mexico City on the beautiful Paseo de la Reforma in the Zona Rosa and across the street from the U.S. Embassy. Nightlife,eateries,shopping are all with in walking distance. The hotel room decor is a little outdated but the service is always wonderful. I have stayed there a couple of times and would not hesitate to do it again and I would recommend it to just about anyone.The only downside to the Aristos is that in the winter time the higher floor rooms can get a little chilly.", "Date": "Jul 16, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR168126206", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "JorgeZD"}, {"Content": "Loved the Aristos This was the second time in June that I went for 7 days to the Aristos Hotel. Just like the first time I was there, the service was excellent, the meals were excellent, everyone was very polite, the rooms were spotless, clean sheets everyday, room service very prompt and staff was very courteous. Even though the hotel is old, it is well kept. This hotel is located in a very good location, everything you need is close by, the pharmacy where you can buy everything, a main shopping street even a church just a few buildings away for anyone who wants to start the day with Mass It is also very reasonably priced. There is a nightclub and a bar, restaurant, swimming pool on the third floor to cool you down after a hot day. For those with a busy schedule while staying in Mexico City, the Aristos Hotel is the perfect place to stay.", "Date": "Jul 11, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR370384152", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d155690-r2111082-Aristos_Mexico_City-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "HotelID": "155690", "Price": "$101"}}
