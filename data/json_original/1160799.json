The nearest metro stop is Ottaviano Station on the other side of St Peters, a 15 min walk away. The 64 bus runs between Roma San Pietro and Roma Termini but gets incredibly crowded so wouldn't recommend trying to squeeze on with luggage, plus the traffic in some parts is so awful you don't get far very fast. We found walking was the best way to get around the sights. It's easy enough to walk into the old town area across the Tiber or down to Trastavere for dinner. Emilia met us on arrival and was lovely, very helpful and welcoming. The guesthouse has 2 rooms, 1 with ensuite, 1 with the bathroom right next door to the room and a wee kitchen separating them. Emilia and her family live just next door if you should happen to need help with anything. Definitely take her up on her suggestions of local places to eat, we had some fantastic, and great value, meals. There's also a wee bakery/take away pizza type place around the corner on the train station side that had some of the best and cheapest pizza we've had, plus beers, juices and things. Dinner and drinks for under \u20ac10! The room is beautifully decorated and cared for. Comfortable bed, dresser, couch. Small, modern and functional bathroom. There's air con in the room, a tv, and free wifi. Breakfast is included and is pre-packaged croissants and cake, spreads, coffee/milk/juices. The kitchen is fully equipped if you preferred to cook or you can stock other breakfast items. We found it enough to start the day on if a little repetitive by the 4th morning! The room was serviced daily. The only downsides we had were that the walls were thin so were woken each night, sometimes 2-3am, by the people in the other room coming home, sometimes staying up later drinking. The front door lock was a struggle and very noisy. The shower was awful, just a trickle so I struggled to wash my hair and the hot water constantly disappeared so we'd have to turn the water off/on numerous times. Not sure if that's a building water issue or for this particular place. Contrary to what another reviewer found, we were able to pay with credit card. Overall really enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend it or stay there again if we return to Rome.", "Date": "October 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cSshhhh, Rome's best kept secret\u201d", "Author": "Criminalhack", "ReviewID": "UR117576751", "Content": "La Cupola was excellent. Originally a one-bedroomed second floor apartment, the owners have moved next door, and converted what was the sitting room into a bedroom ensuite. Hey presto, a tastefully decorated two bedroomed apartment with kitchen and two bathrooms, ideal for us as a family of five (mum, dad and threee kids aged 14,11 and 9) to explore Rome. Both rooms are elegantly decorated and high ceilinged, equipped with TV's and importantly air conditioning, essential during the heat of August. Our host was lovely - she spent some time with us upon arrival helping us with our bearings and providing useful tips about transport - and thereafter pretty much left us to it. The apartment was cleaned daily, and it was delightful to return to the beds made and the kitchen cleaned. Breakfast was continental, the fridge was filled with bottled water and juice and the kitchen well equipped for a spot of cooking if needs be ( we didn't). The location was superb. I hope the photograph uploaded gives a sense of proximity to St Peters, taken as it was from the top of the Basilica. It is, literally, across the road - time your visit right ( before the cruise ship visitors arrive at 10.30 ish) and you need not queue. We attended 9am Mass on Sunday morning, and were seated on time having left the apartment at 8.40am. The road seen from the photograph is the main road into the City Centre, with the stop for the number 64 bus close by. 1 Euro per adult passenger is very reasonable to get you within touching distance of Trevi and the Piazzas. The apartment was also, importantly for us, walking distance from San Pietro station. If you are travelling to Rome by train from Fiumicino, you change at Trastevere and it is one stop on - a cheap transfer from the airport. We were using the apartment as a stopover before onward travel to Civitavecchia - the train to the port is direct from San Pietro and takes about 45 minutes, and on a Sunday cost the five of us no more than 20 euros. Although on the second floor, there is a lift, although a few steps have to be negociated before reaching it. This may not therefore be suitable for particularly infirm visitors. All in all, exceptional value, beautifully kept, and ideally located. We could not recommend this highly enough", "Date": "September 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vienna, Austria", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, small but clean\u201d", "Author": "GrunerVeltiner", "ReviewID": "UR115440463", "Content": "Located in a residential neighborhood behind the Vatican, this converted apartment offers a less-touristy, more local view of Rome within easy walking distance of the major sights on the other side of the Tiber River.

With the fall of the dollar, our favorite small hotel near the Spanish Steps was no longer an acceptable choice. Our research was well-rewarded. Sotto La Cupola turned out so much better than we expected, and for such a reasonable price.....we LOVE this place! It's on a quiet side street with easy access to St. Peter's & the Vatican, and convenient to the #64 bus or Ottaviano Metro station if you don't want to walk to Rome's other tourist attractions. The Guest House is comprised of two attractive, well-appointed, very comfortable bedrooms & baths on the second floor of an apartment building. One has a mosaic-tiled bathroom alongside, ours had the bathroom en suite. A self-service kitchen separates the two guest rooms. The \"icing on the cake\" was the genuinely warm, kind, patient attention provided by the owners, Emilia & Alessio, who live next door with their young son. Emilia, who is multi-lingual, was always available to help with a smile. After spending the day out-and-about in this vibrant city, it was a treat to recover from sensory overload in our soothing, cozy oasis.
