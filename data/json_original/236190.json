Thankfully, the beds were very comfortable so I managed to get a good nights sleep. The location is perfect for shopping and the main sights and attractions of Barcelona. It literally is 10minutes walk from the beautiful Gaudi Cathedral. (Sagrada Familia). There is also a lovely little bakery nearby where you can get a tasty pastry and a nice cup of tea for your breakfast.

Okay so this is a simple 3 star hotel - go into knowing this and you will love it. The room is spacious enough, we had two twin beds and there was enough room to move around them and the bathroom was simple anf effective - the shower is at the side of the bath instead of the end so the curtain sticks to you a bit! The free wifi is really handy, full signal and fast enough. You get a code for each device you need when you check in - my sim stopped working a day into my trip so having wifi made this so much easier. This hotel is so close the bus station that the buses come in to from Girona - an easy walk even carrying bags. The local metro station is Monumental and it is a very easy walk away. The small bar across the road - Yuste has to be tried, we ate Tapas in lots of places and found the couple of things we tried as a snack here whilst waiting for a friend to be some of the best we tried. We tried the breakfast one day and it is simple, rolls and croissants and cheese and ham plus the usual fruit and yoghurt. It was just over 8 Euros each and I would say that it was worth it although there are plenty of local places that looked lovely. We had the most fantastic time in Barcelona, covered a lot of ground and felt we got to know it quite well. Highlights - the open top bus tour, I love these to get a feel for a city, well we enjoyed this but it went to so many places we weren't interested in it isn't as good as those in other sities, if you are undecided I would advise you to give it a miss. The old town is fantastic, hard to get bearings but don't worry, just wander! The Rambas - hmmm good to see but not worth staying on for long - get into the small streets. As for Tapas I can't recommend highly enough the Lonja de Tapas - fantastic, and we treid a few places and chose to go back there for our last night. We also tried the highly recomended Ciudad Condal and I am afraid to say that we didn't really rate it. Not as much as Lonja www.lonjadetapas.com. Other highlight is cycling. I haven't been on a bike in over 20 years and was worried about keeping up with my 13 year old BMX mad son! Okay so my legs got tired and it was a bit scary at first but I would really suggest you give it a try. We didn't want to use the orange amsterdam bike place as they didn't have gears so we went for BornBike. They were so helpful and friendly I wouldn't hesitate to suggest you go to them.

The bottom line is that this is no place special -- I would certainly look at all options before jumping to book here based on others' seemingly positive reviews. I paid 70 Euros / night for a single (two bed) room staying here in May, and my experience was absolutely underwhelming. While the people working at this hotel are friendly and helpful, the physical hotel has the feel of a Motel 6, without the consistency. I'm not a picky traveler. But on checking in to the Acta Antibes, I had to try 3 rooms before finding one that was acceptable. The first room's bathroom smelled so strongly of chlorine, it made me gag. The second room's shower was dripping water from the floor above, through the ceiling tiles, and the third room I finally gave up and accepted, despite the wifi signal being nonexistent. At that point, every room had had a problem, and I didn't want to ask for more trouble. The staff were apologetic, and helped me each time, but it doesn't fix this property's generally poor state (at least by US standards). The hallways are dark and uninviting. The biggest problem is the bathrooms -- poorly venilated by a tenement-style dark air shaft, through which you can hear your neighbors talking and using their bathrooms.

Lucky I memorised google streetmap, as the taxi driver had no idea where it was. The taxi cost around \u20ac25. The staff on duty when checking in were polite. Nothing exceptional. Cant complain. The room itself was small but clean. We had a window with a view of a fire escape and someones washing line. There was hardly any natural light. But we were happy with what we got, because we didnt go to Barcelona to stay in the hotel. Because we arrived late on a Sunday evening, we were looking for something nearby to eat. As everyone has said, there are lots of bars and cafes nearby. We chose one by Monumental station, which is less than a 5 minute walk away. I'm quite a light sleeper, but really, you can hear everything going on in the corridor and the rooms next to you. One morning, I heard the guy in the room next to me, doing his business in the bathroom from our bathroom. (bathroom has a half tub, so dont expect to have a relaxing soak after a day out.) Nights 2 and 3 were fine though, as I tired myself out from walking so much. We decided not to pay \u20ac7-8 for breakfast, and went to one of the cafes to get a hot brekkie. There is a bakery on the way to Monumental station, that sells scrummy croissants. I got one on another occasion, with a tea - around \u20ac2. Barcelona is not the place to watch 'real' Flamenco, apparently. But it was my first time to Spain and I wanted to see some Flamenco. Having done my research online, I opted for Tablao Cordobes which is on Ramblas (Was fantastic, btw). I was happy to find that you can buy your ticket at the front desk. I kept meaning to ask the name of the guy at the front desk who helped us with that, but totally forgot. He was EXTREMELY helpful. Being a massive football fan, I was asking him about the Camp Nou tour (With all the Gaudi about, I'm sorry but Camp Nou was my FAVOURITE POI). He printed out all this info for us from the website. I knew everything he told me, as I had checked the website via the free wifi (which I think every hotel should have), but he was very thorough. The hotel is walking distance to everything. As everyone has said, it's right by Sagrada Familia and its 9 blocks away from Passieg de Gracia. On our first day, we queued for around 2 hours to get into Sagrada Familia. Mind you, we got there late, so make sure to go early! We took the elevator up to the top of the tower, then took the scary walk down. I finally knew the meaning of legs feeling like jelly. After, we ate lunch, had a couple of beers to calm us down, then went back to the hotel to freshen up. We then walked to Passieg de Gracia (which I mentioned is 9 blocks away from the hotel). It was a very nice walk. It was pretty quiet, as it was around siesta. After visiting Casa Batllo, walking to Las Ramblas, exploring Mercat St Josep La Boqueria, then walking to the pier, I was absolutely exhausted. I dont regret it, but definitely would not recommend it at all. Point is, Acta Antibes is away from the raucous of the tourist spots (ramblas), but near enough to walk, sort of. It's clean and safe and right by the metro station with lots of bars and cafes nearby. Staff were lovely and they have a luggage hold too.

We had read the reviews on Trip Advisor and chose to select this Hotel since we also got a good deal. I'll break down the details here; Cleanliness - Very clean, basic and simple hotel. It has a 'modernist' look - glass and metal - that makes the room and hotel look clean and polished. Rooms - The rooms are adequate in size for the price for Barcelona. We requested 2 separate beds since the 'double bed' would be too small. There is a small desk area and also a closet. No fridge though. The bathroom has a bidet as well. The curtains are completely dark and so you don't get any light if you close them - which is good for sleeping at night. Location: It is close to the metro (Monumental) - only about 200 yards away. It is also close to a couple of bakeries, a deli (fresh meat and cheeses), small supermarkets etc - so you can get fresh fruit, make your own sandwiches, get gallons of water etc - all for a decent price. Monumental station is also very central and can get you quickly to all major sights around the city. The city is also not too large so you can walk around and really get a good 'feel' of the city's 'energy'. Sleep Quality: We asked for a quiet room in the back of the Hotel. At night, there is practically no noise and light from the street. So you can sleep fairly well. The beds are average - nothing fancy - but well enough to get some sleep. Staff: The front desk was very helpful, intelligent and well informed. They spoke excellent English (as well as several other languages), were always available to help and accommodated our requests to check out a little later than the set time. Negative Points - Room Heating - When we were here, BCN was still cold (about 55 in the day and 37 at night). The room is supposed to have wall units w/ radiating heat - the kind that allow hot water to flow thru them and heat up the room. Problem is that they did not work well. No matter how you turned the heating knob, the heater would always feel 'warm'. We played around with it for an hour to test it out and we could not get it to work well. So it was a bit colder in the room that we would have liked. Internet/WIFI in the room - Since we were here on business, this was a big problem. The connection in our room was very poor. We could not get a connection. Our signal strength was very weak and emails could not be sent out. The only solution was to go down to the second floor - dining area - and get all work done here. Signal strength works best on the 2nd floor dining area. It is open 24 hours. Getting here from BCN Airport: If you're taking the metro to this Monumental stop from the Airport - and if you have larger bags - you're in for a rough time. The major interchange is at the 'Passeg di Gracia' station - and it's got a lot of stairs - up and down - and then also long walks thru crowds of people. So by the time you arrive at the Monumental station, you will be tired and irritated :)", "Date": "March 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris", "Title": "\u201cGood clean central hotel at affordable rates\u201d", "Author": "Manu73Paris", "ReviewID": "UR58660757", "Content": "This is a good one, nice, clean, refurbished (the reception area), rooms are comfortable and the hotels location (10mins walk from Sagrada Familia, 20mins from La Rambla, Pla\u00e7a Catalunya).

Buses are as close as the Metro but we walked to most of the tourist sites - Las Ramblas, the parks, the Monderisme buildings (not just the Gaudis), the Bario Gotic. Suggestions - go to the Fundacio Joan Miro as soon as they open in the morning (it gets hectic later on), Metro from Monumental to Paral-lel, don't leave the station to change to the funicular up the hill, its all in the one fare. Then walk on up the hill to catch a whole range of views across town. Eat at the Nogal restaurant a couple of doors down from the Acta Antibes. It's packed with local people eating, drinking, celebrating birthdays. Lunch - three good courses, water and a bottle of wine, 18 euros for two. More good restaurants along Disputacio. Buy a T-10 travel ticket. Avoid the Passeig Gracia Metro station if you can - it's confusing and full of long tunnels.

Saves you 10-20 euro on breakfast/coffee daily. our room faced the street, but there were double sliding windows, so the noise was not a problem. Free wireless internet Con's The bed was like a rock. My back is killing me The air conditioner didn't work very well, we'd often wake up sweating only to find that it had stopped pumping cool air for some unknown reason (fortunately, the weather is great, so we just opened the window, but then there would be some noise). If you stay here, make sure to walk down to the Passeig de Gracia to see the Gaudi buildings and eat at Cervecceria Catalana (C/ Mallorca 236). It was easily the best restaurant we ate at. Amazing tapas.
