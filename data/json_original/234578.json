The beach also isn't very far and is within walking distance; as is the cable-car. The staff were very helpful and spoke good English. They provided us with a map and the check-in/check-out process was very swift.

However I was pleasantly surprised when I checked into my room of the quality of this hotel. The rooms were tastefully decorated, and had modern fittings. I don't think any of the rooms offer much of a view, other than the street below however. Unfortunately I lost the photos I took of the room itself... Park has a boutique feel, and the wooden spiral staircase leading all the way to the top of the building is really neat. The staff downstairs at the front desk and bar were great. I had a parcel delivered from amazon.com to the hotel and it was delivered to my room. The best thing about this property is the amount of things you can do in the local area surrounding the hotel. There are several restaurants nearby, cafe's and boutiques crammed into the alleyways behind the hotel. A short stroll from the front of the hotel is the Barcelona waterfront / harbour area which is great on a sunny day. The hotel is also easily accessible to the Barceloneta metro station which is a 5minute walk across the road. Alternatively you can walk to the Jaume I metro station in 10 or so minutes, through the alleys behind the hotel, this is a magical walk. We dined most nights at the restraunt in a street beside the hotel called Salero, which served Asian Fusion as well as local type food.

Also, the room was a nice size and the bed was comfortable. The furnishings were nice and updated. The location was great! We walked around at night and enjoyed looking at all the really old buildings and alleys and restaurants. Watch out for the Tapas bars though. They are looking for those that are unsuspecting of how to order, as we were. Before we knew what had happened we found that we had ordered 4 entree's. We said that we wanted a particular dish, then changed our minds to order something else, and they added both of them to our order without taking note that we changed our minds. Also watch out for the second waiter coming to your table and making \"suggestions\" for dishes... they write those down too. Oh, and watch out for Pickpockets!

They don't disclose this in any place, but you will be charged 60 euro cents/minute for a local call. Yep, even if you're calling the restaurant next door. AND, I found to my dismay, even for calling a toll-free number. I had to change some travel arrangements with an airline, and called their Spain toll-free number. When I checked out, I was charged nearly 20 euro. Yikes. I told the management that they should make this clear in their phone instructions, especially because in the USA toll-free calls are always free, even from hotel phones. I travel frequently in Europe and have never been charged this much for a phone call. That being said, I very much liked the Park Hotel. Booked through Venere.com and was very happy with everything-- the price, the location, and the room itself. The staff was friendly (though I'm sure the guy at the front desk was silently cursing me while discussing the phone call charge). My room was very small, as a single, but perfect for me, very comfortable, with its own thermostat for A/C, and super clean. I also appreciated the user-friendly safe in the closet, so I could lock up my passport and wallet during the day and only carry a bit of cash with me (I'd heard Barcelona was famous for pick-pocketing. and the second night a woman 3 feet from me on a main street had her purse snatched. That's when I decided to leave the valuables in the hotel safe!) The bathroom was huge and had a full sized tub, which was heavenly after spending four days in London in a hostel. Great TV, including BBC world and National Geographic. Wonderful breakfast- eggs, bacon to fruit and cereal. Walking distance to the old city center (and the beach, though I wouldn't recommend Barcelona's beaches), and the Estacio de Franca across the street (a beautiful old station, not scummy like some city train stations) makes getting to the airport a dream. Even if you arrive at Sants station, you can jump on the airport trian (C10) in the opposite direction and be at Franca in 5 minutes. A great find, highly recommended.

The location was perfect. Almost across the road from the Franca station which has direct trains to the airport, around the corner from the Barceloneta metro station and a short walk to a lovely park containing the zoo and to a hop-on hop-off bus stop. The old town started just behind the hotel and we took an easy ramble through it to get to Las Ramblas, the main touristy boulevard. The beach front, with its masses of restaurants, was about a 10 minute walk, and a few minutes further was the start of the cable car that goes over the harbour area. The room was compact, but not small and tastefully decorated and (big plus) the air con worked well. Noise wise - the window was double glazed, but some muffled partying did carry up. Continental breakfast was good, but not brilliant and best of all was in a spacious room with attentive staff... (this is rare - breakfasts are usually cramped and rushed). The hotel had a bar which opened onto the street with tables and chairs on the pavement where one could sit and watch the passing scene - which buzzes until all hours. We had read that people only get going at 10-11pm, but did not realise there would be families (push chairs, toddlers, dogs) wandering around at midnight ! The staff were charming. The barman, with little English, but brilliant sign language, was lovely. I would be delighted to go back there. On another note: The hop-on hop-off bus routes are varied and long. It almost rivals London. There are two routes that take 4 hours (add some for the drivers who get off at stops and disappear for 5 minutes at a time) and a third that takes 2 hours. So if you are going to do this (recommended), leave a whole day just for doing the routes and not getting off much. We did the bus for a day to orientate ourselves and then bought a 10 trip metro/bus card to get back to places we could not walk to.

I read about the hotel on the web on multiple sites, including Trip Advisor. We wanted to be reasonably close to Las Ramblas and the Old City, and we wanted a reasonable price for the hotel, particularly given the poor exchange rate for the U.S. dollar. We were delighted with the result. The hotel is directly across from the Estacio Franco, so one can whisk from the airport to the hotel in an air conditioned train, cross the street, and enter the hotel. It is a short walk to the Picasso Museum, and the hotel backs up to the Ciutat Vella (Barri Gotic). We were also walking distance to the sea, and only a 30 minute walk from Sagrada Familia (a walk we would recommend) The room was reasonably spacious by European standards, with a fold out couch/bed for our son and two twins together as a double for my wife and me. The bath was actually large and spacious, and well equipped with every amenity from hair dryer to bidet to high pressure shower. Breakfast was included and to our surprise and enjoyment included eggs and bacon as well as wonderful croissants, fresh squeezed orange juice, cheese, and the traditional elements of a continental breakfast. Wireless Internet was also provided without additional charge. We enjoyed large bath towels, good air conditioning, a a free safe in the room for valuables. There is a lounge on the 1st or 2nd floor (lobby is 0) with comfortable chairs, etc. The staff was quite fluent in English and extraordinarily gracious and helpful. The hotel was perfect for our needs in every way--comfortable, reasonably priced, conveniently located, and aesthetically pleasing, as well as clean.

Breakfasts were the same every day but lots of food, a very friendly dining staff who kept us well plied with caffe con leche. Most importantly was how they treated me when I was sick. And I was so sick with the flu when I first arrived. No problems. They directed my partner to a nearby Farmacia, made sure he had lots of food and liquids to bring me on breakfast trays and most wonderfully, watched when I stumbled out for a 45 minute breath of fresh air so they could nip in, scrub the room thoroughly and nip back out.....all after normal cleaning hours too.

We just got back from a 2-night stay there and certainly couldn't fault it for its 3-star rating - I'm not sure what it would need for four stars but it had everything we could need. The room was clean, in an excellent state of repair and decoration and everything worked. It was renovated in 1990 (17 years ago) but it has certainly been looked after since then. The 1950's design still shows through beautifully. For us, who like to wander around, the location was spot on. Next to the park, and about 2 minutes walk to the Gothic Quarter (great for the bustle of restaurants, bars and shops in beautiful buildings.) It would take maybe 15 minutes walk to Las Ramblas (if you REALLY want bustle) but the time taken was hard to judge as we took a leisurely meander through the streets, bars and shops, with plenty to occupy and distract you on the way. The marina and the beach are also only five minutes away. If you wanted to venture further, there are bus routes and metro stations very nearby. The other great part about its location is that the Estacion Franca (train station) is just across the road (no noise from that either!) We cautiously took a 25 euro taxi on the way in from the airport, but found that the train got us back to the airport in the same time (about 40 mins) for a mere 2.50 euros each! Our room was a simple double which overlooked a side street (no balcony, but I think some were available on other sides of the hotel). When I say side street, don't picture rubbish skips and winos - we were just facing another similar block of old buildings and roof terraces where normal Spanish people lived and hang out their washing on Sundays. We had one night when we heard a few late-night revellers staggering home but other than that we had a pleasant night's sleep. We certainly didn't suffer any noise from within the hotel as some other people have had. If I had to make a bad comment it would be about the breakfast (we didn't book dinner). While the food was reasonable and the choice was decent, they sometimes struggled to keep up with the steady flow of guests (get there before 9 to avoid the queues) so we were sometimes left scouring the crumbs of the half-empty buffet table.
