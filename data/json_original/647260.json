The hotel provided what was advertised - great location, clean rooms, kosher friendly/vegetarian breakfast, no TV, no phone, part time front desk staff at a price well below other hotels and accomodations in the area. We walked everywhere - to the Jewish Ghetto and synagogue, to the Vatican, to major sites like Trevi Fountain, Forum, piazzas and monuments and an internet center just down the street. We arrived from the airport early in the morning a few hours before check-in time. The staff was very accomodating. We were able to get our keys, put our luggage in our room even though it was not ready yet and use the washrooms which was a huge help. That night, the airconditioning worked just fine...until about 1 AM when the compressor seemed to go off (and went back on at about 5 AM) - It got quite hot in the room and hard to sleep. Opening the windows was no solution because of the noise from the main street. And then...in the mornng there was no hot water to shower! We spoke to the helpful front desk clerk who explained that there was a hot water problem that was being fixed and that indeed the compressor does go off (saving money? neighbor complaints about noise? Not clear).

After recently traveling in the USA and all across Europe, we visited many hotels, but Migdal \"Palace\" was absolutely the worst one ever. As my wife is pregnant, I pre-arranged for the hotel transportation taxi to pick us up from the airport, but the driver didn't show up (this made us waste approx. 3 hours while waiting in vain). After taking the train and a taxi, we reached Migdal Palace, but didn't really get any apology for the incident. The man at the desk simply didn't care. Unfurtunately, this was only the preview of our stay... We found out that the hotel actually looks more like a hospital or a monastery. It's not about \"basic\" (we like basic) - it's about \"depressing\"... Our room had NO telephone, no safe, no pictures on the wall, no shampoo, no air-condition remote control, no fridge or mini-bar... All it did have was an old bed, and a TV set. Simply a joke. Some of the light-bulbs in the room were burned out, it was really bad. The room we got was right next to the front desk (one meter away), and facing the busy street... We didn't sleep at all during the night, as the traffic noise was very strong. The people at the desk gave us a set of 4 keys (!), all of which are a must - there is the room key, there is the hotel floor key, and there are 2 keys for the front doors of the building. Come on... Very uncomfortable to say the least. One night was enough for us to decide we can't stay any longer. Breakfast was dull, and during the morning hours, drilling noises started from an upper floor (as the hotel is located inside an apartment building). We had no trouble finding a different two-star hotel, within five walking minutes away, in a price that was 25% less expensive. And guess what? Our new room had a phone, a safe, shampoo, etc. etc. Bottom line - I wouldn't recomment this hotel at all.
