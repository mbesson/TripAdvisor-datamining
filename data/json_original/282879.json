I did not have a chance to try the breakfast since I found the reservation price already \"good enough\" for my taste and I wanted to explore some caffeterias anyway and taste some genuine french croissants. The room was clean even though a bit too small (someone may say cozy but really would be a nice way to put it). The most disappointing finding was the mattress that seemed to me ready to be changed for a new one. Eventually I had a not soo good night sleep and that as you may imagine did not help much during the day.

The elevator does not accommodate a stroller, and most rooms are too small to put a \"pack-n-play\" into as a bed for a kiddo or two. The only room that we found was Room #27 which has the beautiful view of the courtyard and is spacious enough to accommodate the kid bed and has some space for movement and play. The hotel is located in the Embassy and Ministry quarter so it is very quiet and safe, plus it is very close to the Army Museum where, apparently, Napoleon's Tomb is located. There are plenty of restaurants, our favorite is La Square http://www.restaurant-lesquare.com/, and there are even a couple of grocery stores right across the street if you want to buy milk for the little one or some snacks (and diapers as we found out). The downside of the location is the fact that the subway is not kiddo friendly as well. The Varenne and the Asemblee Nationale Metro stations are very small, require two people to carry the stroller up and down the stairs (no escalator or elevator) and the entrance into the stations takes a well coordinated ballet of having one person go in and then activate the exit gates so the other person with a stroller can come in. Is it a great place with a great service and a very good location that is the safest place in Paris... DEFINITELY... but I would have chosen a better hotel that was a bit better located and easier to get around if I had known these downsides. All in all, if you are traveling sans kids, this is a great place to stay... with kids, especially small ones, I'd suggest finding a different place, even if it means spending more money.

Because of the setback garden and the relatively quiet street, the rooms are very quiet. Our room, on the top floor, actually had a view of the Eiffel Tower from one of the windows. I don't think any other rooms have that view - so be sure to ask for the room on the 4th floor with that view. And the price is reasonable (for Paris). We paid about $260 per night. But there are some important downsides - mostly focussed around the bathroom. As noted above, our room did not have a shower. There was a large tub (that did not drain properly - though they called in a plumber to fix this for us), and a handheld showerhead. If you like to stand under a shower, forget it - that is just not possible. We also thought that the towels were cheap feeling, and the hotel did not provide some toiletries I usually expect to see such as lotion and a vnity kit.

I usually book through the hotel's website, but was glad that I booked this via email because I learned that they could add an extra/roll out bed to some of the rooms (ours was the standard twin with bath) to accommodate our child, whereas the website doesn't present you with that option. The staff is pleasant and courteous. They appeared rather serious, and only responded with information and advice when asked. An older gentleman, who worked at the front desk a brief time during our stay, perked up with enthusiasm and was very helpful in giving us restaurant recommendations on a Sunday, when everything looked closed on our street. We ended up eating at Le Basilic, which was lovely. A couple mornings, the reception seemed overwhelmed (likely due to July being busy), which can affect breakfast room service. The first time, breakfast delivery to the room took an extremely long time and I had to call and check if it was still coming. The second time, reception completely forgot to place our breakfast order with the kitchen, which resulted in a long, hungry wait in our room until I finally went downstairs to inquire about it. I would recommend just going to the dining room or patio for breakfast so you can order directly from the kitchen staff to ensure timely service. Our room on the 2nd floor was clean and comfortable, and faced the beautiful courtyard where breakfast is served (when weather is permitting). The windows are of high quality and seal out any street noise when closed. But even with windows opened, street noise was minimal. The rooms are small and cozy, but of average size by European standards. One of us would have to get up from the desk to allow the other to walk by when moving about the room. There is a closet, refrigerator, safe, and all the basic bathroom amenities - hair dryer, towel warmer (though was turned off in summer) shampoos, conditioner and shower gel. They even have several umbrellas in the lobby for you to borrow and use for your day out. Their free internet is great. The location can't be beat. The Varenne Metro stop is a short 5 minute walk. The hotel is central to all the sights and activities around Paris. The streets in this neighborhood are clean, and a produce store, bakery, grocery store, and a few restaurants are all a few steps away. Whenever finishing a long, busy day in Paris, we loved coming \"home\" to this hotel. I would highly recommend this hotel.", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cExcellent\u201d", "Author": "motherell14", "ReviewID": "UR115617984", "Content": "I have to say this is an \"excellent place\", a perfect little hotel to stay in the center of Paris.

In one occasion, after a horrendous couple of meals offsite, the South Asian, gentleman staffing the front desk, on us asking for recommendations, directed us to a close by small/homey restaurant, Le Sac a Dos, where we had our first of subsequent excellent meals in Paris.

Across the street you can visit Rodin Museum which is also quite pleasant. (If you're a \"lite\" art fan, and the louvre is just too much for you - go there). Now for the room. We got a small room, #44. The bed was 1.40m wide, which is not something we're costumed to. The room looked very clean, the shower and toilets were modern and clean. My wife did claim though, that the bed gave her itches. I did not suffer from this problem and we were too scared to look under the sheets... We did ask to move to a bigger room, preferably with a bed to support my 1.90m (6''2), and we were told by the management \"tomorrow\" for a couple of days. After 3 days, we gave up and decided to stay in our tiny chamber. Our flight left at night, and although the hotel was not fully booked, we were not allowed to stay in our room later than 2pm. Manager wanted 80 euros to let us use the room until 7pm. I offered 20... he refused. I hate when hotels do that and not let you enjoy the last day of your trip as pleasant as possible. Breakfast costs 11 euros and you get coffee, a couple of croissants and some jam. It sounds expensive, I know, but its normal price for Paris it seems... And of course, free wi-fi!! On and all it was a pleasant stay, considering all the pros and cons. Biggest tip: When you check-in, look behind the manager, there's a board of room numbers and prices.

We would recommend it again without hesitation. Varenne itself is close to the Hotel des Invalides, on a quiet street with a village feel. i was expecting a student area, but nothing could be further from the truth - the area is very quietly very wealthy. If you wanted you would have everything within a five minute walk either side of the hotel, including a good selection of good small restaurants, a small supermarket, the Musee Rodin, a tabac, a chemist/pharmacy, and plenty of boulangeries! There was no shortage of places to have breakfast or dinner, which was handy - although the hotel does provide breakfast, it does not do dinner. Although it's close to the centre, Varenne is definitely not a tourist area, which for us was an absolute positive, and it was wonderful to be able to stay in an authentic, Parisian, residential area. i should stress that the area is in no way remote, but everything is very accessible. It feels like a very safe area, and we had no hesitation in walking around the area at night. Rarely did we have to take a taxi, and that was only out of laziness! The road is behind the Assembly Nationale, and there was no shortage of taxis if needed. It's fair to say the road was also patrolled by a lot of police, which did give it a very safe feel! It was so lovely to be away from the main tourist centres, and yet these were easily within reach - the Varenne metro stop is two minutes walk around the corner from the Hotel, and 2-3 stops to the centre of Paris. Place de la Concorde or Musee D'Orsay are probably ten minutes stroll away, and we explored the shops of St Germain, which are another 10-15 minute walk from the hotel. On our first evening we ambled to the Eiffel Tower, which took approximately 25 minutes. All in all, we did as much or as little walking as we liked, and never felt rushed. The hotel itself is small, very cosy, very comfortable and the beds were better than other hotels I've stayed in of similar age or cost. The room had a TV (with only News in English) and a Bose iPod speaker. The room is ensuite (we had a room with a bath), with a separate toilet and bidet, and the shower was fabulous! With a mixture of late and early starts, not once were we disturbed by housekeeping. The staff were exceptionally discrete. We were never woken by road or any other noise, even with the window open. Our room wasn't overlooked. The only downside was that there was no tea and coffee in the room, nor any iron or ironing board (we didn't ask for one, so the hotel may have them), but certainly wouldn't put us off staying again, or recommending the hotel!", "Date": "February 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cHidden gem\u201d", "Author": "jonathanpittsburgh", "ReviewID": "UR95381737", "Content": "We booked hotel de varenne based on the very good reviews on tripadvisor and we have to say everything is true.

We went walking/exploring after checking in and within 15mins found ourselves on the Champs Elysees! Our hop-on hop-off bus stop was about a 5 min walk away too which was really handy. All the main attractions in Paris are actually pretty close anyway so one night we spent a couple of hours walking from the Arc de Triomphe to the Eiffel Tower and a few other spots - was beautiful all lit up at night! We didn't have breakfast included but literally a few doors down from the hotel is an award-winning patisserie which was fantastic and we just ate apple pastries or chocolate croissants every morning! The use of the safe in our room was free and so was the internet which we used from a computer in the lobby. A few times we asked the hotel staff about places or restaurants and each time they were more than happy to get out a map and show us exactly where to go. One recommendation was for a restaurant a few streets away called Le Basilic which was lovely with beautiful food.

For a Paris boutique hotel, this is definitely a gem. Couple of points to note though to prepare others considering a stay here - on Sundays the area around the hotel is pretty dead. If you are planning on skipping the breakfast in the hotel which is indeed meagerly, be prepared. The Patisseries that people have noted in other reviews just a few steps away are closed on Sundays and the bistro close to the Metro is closed as well. You have to walk a few blocks to find anything open to find food - so keep that in mind (walking is anyway a reality in Paris, so you should be prepared for that regardless).

They apparently had some issue with double booking, so they had managed to get a room for us at a hotel a few blocks down (hotel Bourgogne et Montana). While we were pretty skeptical of this arrangement, we agreed to give it a shot as otherwise it would have meant we had to go searching for another hotel in the high July season. The lady at the front desk at Varenne made sure that we were fine with this arrangement, apologized a few times, walked with us to the other hotel rolling one of our big bags for us and made sure everything was all taken care of at the other hotel.

I consider the price (230 Euros a night not including breakfast) quite steep for the standard of the hotel (which is 3 star) but the location is amazing! The district is very quiet (I saw many embassies and consulates as we walked around) but very close to everything, including the metro! We didn't use the Metro, however, preferring to walk everywhere. The reception staff were really lovely and helpful, however, the breakfast staff did not speak or seem to understand English which lead to many miscommunications and incorrect orders! In itself, this wouldn't have been a problem, but they were not at all friendly and did not share a smile with us in the two days we were there. Housekeeping was, likewise, not particularly friendly (not even a 'Bonjour' as we plassed in the hall) which is a shame as the front desk staff try hard to create a friendly atmosphere. I would stay in this hotel again and recommend it to a friend but mostly due to the location. I'm not sure it's rating as 3rd most popular hotel in Paris on Tripadvisor is warranted (at least it was at the time I booked) - generally I expect more from a hotel rated so highly on Tripadvsor.com.", "Date": "July 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tucson, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cThis is an awesome hotel\u201d", "Author": "GusM", "ReviewID": "UR71422419", "Content": "This was our third stay at the Varenne, and it gets better each time.

I came with my 11 year old daughter. The hotel is very clean. Also very small, situated in a residential area in the 7th arrondisement.

It offers breakfast - either \"petit dejuner\" which is coffee or tea, juice, breads and jam, or a larger breakfast with eggs, toast and fruit (both for an extra charge) Our room was small by American standards, but all we really needed. We stayed in room 27, equipped with 2 twin beds, small closet, mini-fridge, safe, TV, AIR CONDITIONING, and large bathroom with bath, sink, and stocked with towels, washcloths, water glasses, hand soap, shower gel, shampoo and lotion. Apparently, there are larger rooms, as a family of 4 is staying here as well. Across the street there is a small grocery store, and laundry / dry cleaner. Down the street is a lovely fruit shop and also a yummy bakery. Also in the same block are a pharmacy, and 2 banks with cash machines. Many good cafes and restaurants within 5 - 10 minute walk. 5 minute walk to the Invalides Metro stop so very easy to take Metro transport almost anywhere.

I sat and waited...and waited...and waited...for the one server just to clear the finished breakfast dishes in front of me from the previous guest. She cleared the table next to mine, even though no one was sitting there, but ignored the mess in front of me! So I asked for a menu, thinking she thought they were my dishes. Still no dish removal, let alone a cup of coffee. I finally gave up and left. Since it was a Sunday morning, nothing else was open.

We paid roughly $200 USD per night and stayed here for two nights. The rooms are clean. The bathrooms are nice. The staff are very nice, if not particularly chatty (and all speak English). I feel a little bad saying that's a perk but it is- my French is just barely good enough to communicate basic needs to a hotel. A word about the breakfast: It's a little underwhelming. The baguettes are fine. The pastries are so-so. Consider going to the patisserie next door. However, if you're a coffee-drinking American like my girfriend and I are (read: you need a good amount of coffee), overall I think the 10 euros is actually a pretty good deal. You get a pot with four cups of coffee. Anywhere else you'll pay 4.50 euro per cup. So it's actually a good value as far as the coffee is concerned. I think the hotel should consider at least adding some fresh fruit to the breakfast. I'm sure this would be a relatively marginal cost. Overall the room was fine, if a little tired. A word of note: the double bed room with the \"bath\" is not a standard bath (at least as I know them as an American). It's a bathtub with a shower head thing on a hose. In other words you must sit in the tub and wash yourself. My girfriend felt it was a bit like being in a Degas painting. For two nights it was fine but if you have an aversion to this I would consider getting a room with a shower. The location is excellent! Don't expect to find any cheap food nearby. But make sure to head to Ampelos (across the street and a couple blocks to the left upon exiting) if you like wine! The neighborhood is wonderful. Head to the other side of Invalides and down Rue St. Dominique for a plethora of great restaurants. While we were there, the hotel was doing a lot of painting. I didn't really mind it that much, but the signage wasn't very good. Twice I got paint on myself (fortunately not on my clothes) before I had an opportunity to read or be told about the wet paint. If you are a claustrophobe, beware of the elevator. It is the smallest elevator ever.!You can scarcely fit one person plus their luggage in it. The internet is free but very slow.

Our room overlooked the small courtyard and was very clean. The double bed was extremely comfortable. The shower was good and powerful with soaps and shampoo provided together with warm towels from the heated towel rail. A flat screen TV with satellite channels completed the facilities. Breakfast was the usual continental with freshly baked baguette, pastries and preserves, fruit juice and tea or coffeee. The down side is the dining room is quite small and can become crowded. The only reason we did not rate as 'excellent' is because we waited 15 minutes sitting at an uncleared table before clearing it ourselves and getting the manager's attention for some service. The previous day we had excellent service so maybe we were just unlucky on this occasion. This hotel is ideally situated for walking to the usual Paris sights, Eiffel Tower, Place de la Concorde, even 'les grands magasins'. As this was our first visit to Paris we took advantage of L'Open Tour, an open top bus tour. We opted for the two day ticket, giving four different tours, to orientate ourselves. Unfortunately, the weather was so cold that we spent the tours inside rather than on the open upper deck. This ticket was good value at 29 Euro as against 26 Euro for a one day pass. We also tried the 'Batobus' a river boat cruise, again with the two day option. This was a very relaxed way to cruise the Seine, in a totally enclosed glass cruise boat. We travelled via Eurostar which was quick and comfortable. Buying a 'carnet' of ten tickets for the Metro was a bit excessive as we only used four because walking and the bus tours were so convenient.

The hotel is located in the quiet 7th district. This is mostly government offices so after 5 it is nice and quiet. The Metro is a 5 min walk and Les Invalides is about the same distance. There is a fully stocked mini grocery store across the street and an upscale wine store a little further down. Pastry shops and cafes are nearby. We ended up ignoring the advice to avoid the breakfast and chose to eat in the hotel and get it out of the way. Although the continental breakfast, at 10 Euro, is a bit steep, for 6 euro you could get 2 eggs, coffee and the ever present baguette. Not a bad deal and no leaving the hotel required. The rooms were air conditioned so you can close the windows at night. The windows were all new, so street noise was minimal. And at the end of a long day of looking at wacky French art, make sure you plan to meet in the cozy Varenne courtyard with a bottle of St. Estaphe, a wheel of stinky fromage and yes, a baguette. (and throw a few crumbs to the resident pigeon, who we named Abindicator) All in all, a great, charming hotel at a decent price.

The room we had was a standard double with a shower, and it was in very good shape. It was extremely clean and well kept. The bathroom was in excellent shape with a separate WC. The room itself would be considered small for people used to American hotels, but by European standards, it seemed like a standard size room. There was a flat screen TV with quite a few stations, and a DVD player in the TV. However, I don't know why somebody would choose a hotel in Paris based on the TV since it won't be watched much. The hotel is located within a five minute walk to the Invalides, which is where Napolean's tomb is, and about 2 minutes from the Musee de Rodin. There is also a metro station on the same block which made it extremely convenient and easy to get around the city. Most importantly, the staff was wonderful. The staff is who make the hotel what it is. Every staff member was extremely polite and made every effort to help us with whatever we needed.

The location has a LOT going for it if you're not used to city (or town for that matter) noise. We live in a rural location with no noise or street light at night, so finding somewhere that we can get a good night's sleep is very important to us and the Varenne certainly does that. The combination of a quiet area, a quiet street within that area and being tucked into a courtyard all help. Check was quick and simple (although I always understood that in customer service protocol it was a good idea to stand up to welcome someone?) and the lift small lift can just about take 2 people and a suitcase. Small but elegant reception area and the whole place has a cared-for feel about it. The hotel's own pics are a good representation of what you'll actually get. Our superior double (room 38) was larger than the boys' twin (25) although the sloping ceiling did mean that a good part of the floor area was either not really usable or could be walked under only with a severe stoop. I lost count of our combined total of head-bumping incidents! Good size and good quality double bed and linens. Very well appointed bathroom and separate WC in both rooms - all immaculately clean and look quite recently installed. Like most hotels they change towels only when you want for 'green' reasons, but sinks don't have plugs so you end up using a lot of extra water unnecessarily. Not quite sure how this fits in to a sustainability agenda? Large flat screen TV in each room - a huge Samsung multi-speaker set up in ours with DVD player too - a big hit with the kids, although it did rather dominate the room. Friendly staff and generous breakfasts served at a leisurely pace (until midday too!) either inside or in the courtyard, or in your room if you want. Location is ideal if you're happy to walk to get around or using the Metro. If you want to be able to stagger back from a heavy night this is not the hotel for you as apart form a small supermarket and shops and 3 or 4 restaurants, there's not much in the immediate area other than embassies and offices. I think the thing we missed most was the ability to get a coffee, tea or cold drink in the hotel other than at breakfast. Most UK rooms have tea and coffee making materials in the rooms and when a hotel doesn't have any bar or room service, and there's nothing in the immediate local area, this is a bit of a drawback.

The hotel does not have connecting rooms, but we had two rooms next to one another at the back of the first (second) floor and felt as if we had our own little wing. As other reviewers have described, the rooms were spacious by European standards, nicely decorated, comfortable beds and linens, nice bathrooms. Couldn't have asked for more in that regard. Our rooms overlooked the lovely courtyard, which was very tranquil. A nice place to peruse your guidebooks while having a late afternoon wine and cheese break, as I observed one couple doing. We did notice that, because of the courtyard's enclosed nature, sound traveled quite easily up from the courtyard as well as from room to room. (For instance, with the windows open, we could hear our kids talking in their room next door.) However, during our stay, the hotel was very quiet (except for my family!) and we were never bothered by outside noise. Based on reviews here and elsewhere, we chose this hotel for our first stay in Paris because it was important to us to have a quiet place to return to at the end of a day out in the city. We got what we wished for--almost too much so! We arrived on a Saturday and the neighborhood was nearly deserted for the weekend. We had trouble finding open restaurants nearby on both Saturday and Sunday nights. Once Monday came around, it was like a different place, as the neighborhood is home to many government offices. There are grocers, patisseries, and fruit markets along the street, selling delicious (and expensive!) treats. The neighborhood is pleasant to walk around, but if you are looking for a lively neighborhood, with lots of street life, this is probably not the best location in which to base yourself. Once inside the hotel, all is quiet. I know that most people would find this very pleasant (and I'm not complaining!), but as a family travelling with two not-always-quiet boys, we sometimes found it a bit oppressive. Even at breakfast, guests seemed inclined to speak in hushed tones. So, just a warning that it might not be the best option for anyone travelling with young children. Recent reviews here have mentioned the helpful staff, but I'm sad to say that we did not find this to be the case. This is my one main complaint with the hotel and would be a serious consideration in whether I would ever stay here again. One of the reasons we decided to stay in a hotel during our first trip to Paris, rather than to rent an apartment, was because we wanted to be able to get information on local restaurants, the Metro system, shops, etc. Of the 4 or 5 desk staff we dealt with during our stay, only one could be considered friendly and somewhat helpful. When we were having trouble finding restaurants open on the weekend, and we specifically asked the man at the desk for suggestions, he just motioned with his hand that there were many restaurants \"over that way.\" This may not be the best place to stay if you are in Paris for the first time and are hoping to get advice from the staff about things to see and do. In the lobby, I didn't notice any maps or literature around for tourists. Though there were many tourists, mostly American, at the hotel during our stay, I had the impression that the hotel sees itself more as catering towards those who are on business in the area. Lastly, the subject all reviews must deal with: the breakfast! We chose to have breakfast at the hotel each day; it was just easier for us. People complain about paying 10 Euros but, unless you really are only going to buy a cup of coffee and a croissant, in that neighborhood, you really aren't going to save any money. You will save time, however! The breakfast room is small and we had to wait about 10 minutes one day for a table to open up. Even when we were the only ones in the room, service was quite leisurely, so don't expect a quick bite and a gulp and go! There is a standard continental breakfast, but also a junior version (6 Euros), and many a la carte options, including eggs. No complaints with the food; it was very tasty and more than ample. And you can walk a few doors down for the most delicious fruit to accompany your breakfast! For the jetlag set, another plus is that breakfast is available until \"midday\", which we gratefully took advantage of the first morning of our arrival. This is a lovely hotel, as many reviews have noted. We wanted a quiet place, and that's what we got.

This hotel was located in the district where the embassies are located. ON a narrow street boarded by large embassy complex's and Rouden Museum just up the street the invalides park just two blocks away. Charming area, very quiet. A long narrow street, boarded by small shops and including two small mom and pop grocery stores. The room we booked was on the 2nd floor. It was large and the window opened on to a view of other ( we assumed homes) not a bad view at all. the room was largest of the two hotels in Paris we lodged at and the 2nd largest of the three hotels for our whole trip. The bathroom was large and had lovely tile and amenities the shower was thought not large was roomy enough with a shower curtain closure. Soaps and Shampoos were better quality then at the other hotels, large towels of nice quality and in the winter the towel rack must be designed to heat the towels up, nice touch. The whole bathroom was tiled, it was elegant looking. The room had besides nice furnishings, a thin, mounted TV, with cable with two channels for those that miss their CNN or BBC, English speaking TV. Adequate hair dryer in the bathroom. A safe, and a refrigerator as well. The closet lighted up the interior when it was opened and had shelf's and room to hang clothing. There was also a stand to place ones luggage on, rather then have ones bags on the floor. The bedding covers were nice, as were the linens for the bed and mattress and pillows were comfortable. all matched the decor nicely. When you enter the hotel it has a garden entrance with small table to sit at and read or eat a snack, or write home. The hotel had breakfast , the usual fair for Paris hotels, but we skipped that to eat at the local bakeries and restaurants. The other guests ate breakfast and the food appeared to look good. The first floor contained the lobby which was quaint and a breakfast eating area. The lift goes to the upper levels and well as there is a carpeted stairs to the upper floors.We had one hot day on our trip , and we were at this hotel and the air conditioner worked well. Individual units for each room. So you could adjust the air to ones choosing. It was quiet area, we enjoyed our stay there and would go again. \\for those that are disabled it would be a good choice as there is space for either a wheel chair or electric wheel chair to be stored and no stairs to climb, and the larger rooms size and bathroom would be plus. The staff were nice and helpful, but not as friendly as the first hotel we used, I would say they were more gracious in manner when helping the guests. Not snooty, just more reserved in manner. Always a smile. It was some what a little more elegant place, compared to our other hotel. I was told they accommodate many visitors that have business at the embassies near by, that might account for the more reserved tone of the hotel, but don't get me wrong, the staff was still very nice. It is still a thumbs up choice. The walk to the Eiffel tower , about 2 miles in distance.The Museum D'Orsay was also close, about the same distance. There are several restaurants several blocks over with outside dining . In all we were glad we had two slightly different experiences with the hotels we chose, This hotel was a good choice to bring back some fond memories of Paris. I know many say you don't go to Paris to see the room, but to wake up and go to bed at night or take a break during the day for us it was nice to have a little ambiance of Paris in our commendations as well. I hope someone finds this helpful when making their choice when going to Paris. As I found the reviews here on tripadvisor a real plus when making our choices as to where to stay.

His English was very good however. He confirmed our rooom and handed us the key. Very matter-of-fact. Later I asked for information on restaurants and he gave a generic answer about several in the area, but no specifics on recommendations and/or locations. So we just wandered until we found one. Next to the \"lobby\" is a small room where newspapers are available and a small breakfast nook. There is no bar. Our room was standard for Paris...small. However, the hotel and the room were very well decorated. A wonderful Parisian charm.. . Definite plus for the hotel here. The room had a spacious bathroom with stand-up shower, haridryer as well as plenty of counter space. The room istself had a flat screen TV, small desk, mini-bar, closet and safe . The view was of the courtyard leading from the street... nothing spectacular. Room noise was minimal and we only had one disturbance during our stay from noise in the hall. Our biggest disappointment was the breakfast. We chose to eat breakfast at the hotel twice, but after those two expereinces just decided to hit the bakery and grocery store just 10 meters down the street. Breakfast cost 10 Euro per person and consisted of some rolls/baquettes, cofee or tea, jam... and that's about it. I've eaten \"continental\" breakfasts in dozens of European hotels, to include some in Paris, and this ranks near the bottom for selection and service. The breakfast service was provided in a small little nook/room next to the receptionist desk and consisted of four cramped tables. Come at the wrong time and you have to stand and wait. The waitress spoke no English and was overworked since the tables were always full. We waited usually 10 min before we got any attention. Take my advice, save the money and go buy your breakfast at the bakery next door and the supermarket across the street. One small little note. The TV in the room upon our arrival was a very trendy 20\" flat screen. The hotel literature said the hotel has DVDs for viewing so one night we decided to check out the selction. The hotel had about 40 DVDs, consisting of 1-2+ yr old films (Ocean 12, Lord of the Rings, etc...). However, when I took the DVD up to the room, there was no way to watch it. There was no DVD player?! Later the next day we came back to the room to find a new, bigger flat-screen TV..... with a built in DVD player...alright!! However, when I turned it on to catch some english language news (BBC, Sky, CNN), the only offerings were in French. I have no idea why our bigger, DVD TV lost its english language channels. Hopefully the hotel resolved this later after our departure. So, overall a pleasant experience. But knowing what I know now, this will be our last visit as there are more and better offereings in Paris for the price.", "Date": "April 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cQuiet, convenient location\u201d", "Author": "lakecherokee5", "ReviewID": "UR7380994", "Content": "Stayed here for 4 nights with my teenage daughter.

We booked the winter special offer (129 euro per room, breakfast included) and for that price, we got an authentic, nicely furnitured and comfortable place to stay; a quiet haven from the moment you walk into the entrance garden. Initially, we had a room on the fourth floor based on our miscommunication, but the staff was more than helpful to transfer us to the second floor; less stair-climbing and somewhat spacier. Considering the price, the room was good: nice furniture, excellent badroom and well ventilated. Not much view since we booked a room on the courtyard, but we had absolutely no traffic noise at night. Only the polyester blankets we considered out of date and not too clean, but this was not a great problem. Breakfast is (like in almost every hotel of this pricerange) typically French: tea, coffee or chocolate, orange juice and a basket of bread. If you don't expect an English hotel breakfast buffet, then it's all very fine. The hotel lies in the eastern part of the 7th Arrondissement, a very safe and well-heeled neigbourhood, with some nice restaurants quite nearby. We particularly recommend Le Ferme de Saint Simon (in the Rue de St Simon), a lovely restaurant with very kind staff, however somewhat expensive. Even late at night, this area is very safe, also for two women alone. You can walk to St Germain des Pres (twenty minutes) or to the city centre via the Tuileries (half an hour).

They also helped him find a place to get some takeout soup for me as I was ill. Also they did not replace our soap or even the plastic cups used for water after I threw them away one night, which I think is a pretty basic thing to expect. The other frustrating thing about the location is that although you are nearly close enough to the Hotel des Invalides metro stop, the closest one is actually the Varennes stop, which is not on a major line. We did a lot of transferring to get to this line, although to be fair, you really could just walk most of the time. We walked from the hotel to St. Germain de Pres and the Eiffel Tower, although they might be far for some people.

We read all the reviews before choosing the hotel, and found most all the reviews were very accurate, though I have a different take on some aspects of the hotel and neighborhood. The value is very good for such a clean hotel with new bathrooms, in a nice neighborhood. But our room (the cheapest rate room offered, with a shower not a tub) was TINY and we felt b/c we were staying and paying for 9 nights they could have given us a larger room for the money. It's difficult not even having a chest of drawers and having to literally live out of the suitcase for 9 days. I love the 7th arrondissment. It's so close to many sites, and it's clean and picturesque. Musee Rodin is a couple blocks away which all our friends urged us to see and which was wonderful having nearby b/c we got to see it twice, once in the day and once late at night after dinner. The real difference between the pricier hotels and this one is the staff, ultimately. Only very self-sufficient and people who already know Paris should stay here because the staff know almost nothing about restaurants to recommend, how and where to get a cab for dinner (though they will phone for an airport shuttle for you) or what stores sell what nearby. They are all friendly people, but do not provide true, proper \"concierge\" service. We actually had to walk to another more expensive hotel our first night, to get a recommendation from that concierge for dinner who more readily helped us even though we weren't guests there. Also note the nearby restaurants (many good ones, btw) close early and keep odd hours on odd days, so if you need to eat dinner late plan to eat in another neighborhood or to buy sandwiches you can carry back to the hotel. Otherwise you'll be left digging for stray lefotver airline peanuts in your purse like I was one night! But don't be scared off by my comments, it's a great hotel and a great value.

There was no alarm clock but you can \"program\" the phone to give you a wake up call. I'd bring an alarm clock for back up though. The room was very quiet with respect to outside noise. But the walls are apparently pretty thin. The phone in the adjacent room was easily heard in ours. That said, we rarely heard any voices. I think everyone must have spoken in quiet tones. The prior reviewers were dead on with respect to the location of the hotel. For those wanting to walk out of the hotel into a street of \"action\", stay elsewhere. Such a street is a good 15 minute walk or so. Nevertheless, there are plenty of restaurants, a grocery store and everything else you'll need very close by. ATM is just down the street. The nearest metro is an easy 5 minute walk. Most of the top attactions are within a 15-30 minute walk. The staff was for the most part reserved but very helpful. This is not a B&B type place where they fall over themselves to help you but I believe that's the norm for Paris. There are about 6 people who staff the front desk 24/7. Not all had restaurant recommendations. They give you a xerox copy of a map showing some French restaurants in the 7th but they don't seem prepared to make other recommendations, which is probably not unusual. So come prepared with your own list of places to eat. They will gladly make reservations, call cabs and do all that stuff. For you Mastercard holders, you might check with the hotel to confirm that they take it. We tried to pay for our stay with one and it was not accepted. The receptionist didn't know why but said it was a problem on her end which was clearly the case since I'd been using that card all week, had notified my MC company we'd be in Paris, had gobs of money left on the credit limit, and were able to use it immediately when we got home.

My one complaint with the location is the lack of restaurants in the immediate area, after a long day of walking around the city it would have been nice to have some options close to the hotel. There is an excellent bakery next door, a grocery across the street, and two bank machines at the rue de Grenelle and Bourgogne. The area is very safe and we felt very comfortable walking around late at night. The hotel: the lobby is very small, with a small dining area to the right as you enter. We never ate breakfast at the hotel, but was usually busy when we were leaving in the morning. A very small elevator was tucked away at the other side. The lobby was very small but quaint. We stayed in two different rooms during the week. The first was priced at 120 euros and was located on the second floor. It was located at the end of the hallway, which I thought would be great for noise, but the walls were extremely thin. We heard every noise made in the room next to us, below us and above us, usually sound doesn't bother me, but it was pretty bad...some nights we had a hard time sleeping because of the thin walls. The room was clean and small. One day they installed shelves in our bathroom, without our notification, after which the room smelt of varnish for the remainder of the stay. The second room we stayed in was much better, it was 140 euro on the same floor, but was much bigger, and had two large windows overlooking the garden, we wish we had stayed in this room all week.

It is located between the Invalides and the Place de Bourbon, and just a half block from the Rodin Museum. During the day, at least one family member is present and unfailingly helpful and courteous. The night staff were always multi-lingual and very competant and eager to please. The rooms were clean and effcient. Baths were refurbished. All public and private spaces were done in excellent taste. Breakfast was good, with fresh baguettes from a local baker. If you want a full breakfast, there are optional items at a modest cost. Each time I visit Paris, I try to stay in a different neighborhood. This time I chose the right bank near the Hotel des Invalides, where you can see the tomb of Napolean, part of the military museum complex. In the opposite direction you can take a rigorous 10 minute walk to the Musee' d'Orsay and the St. Germain neighborhood, with its art galleries and elegant shops. Five minutes from the hotel you are standing on the esplanade above the Seine River. In the hotel, internet service is free if you have your own computer. The building is \"hot.\" Otherwise, be prepared to pay six Euros an hour to buy a card and use their one station. There are no internet cafes in the area, so the options are nil; this was my only complaint. This hotel is among the \"Top 10\" among TripAdvisor Paris hotels, and the lowest priced of that group.

It was quiet, clean, nicely if modestly decorated, and comfortable for a hotel in this price range. Staff was pleasant, if not particularly forthcoming. The immediate area is not booming with restaurants or bars, and we found almost everything closed early (or not open at all on Sunday). Fortunately, it's a short walk to the bustling area surrounding Le Bon Marche. Metro access about 1-1/2 blocks. Note: we took several taxis, and I ended up giving all of them directions to this relatively small street. Know your adjoining streets!

Those of you who prefer to pay $300-$500 per night for a large chain with spa etc, may not find the homey atmosphere and quiet location your thing, but we loved it. The area is very safe and quiet, but right in the middle of all the fun areas you'll want to go. We took the RER from the airport and transferred to the C-line, so it couldn't have been easier to get to the hotel from the Invalides metro stop. As others have mentioned, there are great bakeries, produce stands, and markets on the street to grab anything you need to stock your hotel fridge. We enjoyed breakfast at the hotel (the traditional French nosh of baked goods and coffee), but anyone who is looking for a big American breakfast will need to get used to the grocery store. The staff at the hotel were very helpful and polite. The hotel owner, Jean Marc Pommier, went so far as to bake us bread one night when all the bakeries on our street were closed over the Christmas holiday! We were a little intimidated because we didn't speak much French, but as long as you practice some general niceties and try a little French, the locals are wonderful. Just note that they work a 35 hour wk, but when they work, they are extremely busy. They like to be efficient and understandably will get irritated if you dawdle and hold up service for other customers (see complaint in earlier review). As for the room, we had a nice size bedroom and bathroom by Europen standards. The beds leave you a little stiff in the morning, but are probably about the best we've had in our visits to Europe. Comments about cleanliness are correct, as this is one of the cleanest places around and recently renovated. (Just keep in mind to dodge the doggie droppings while out walking though.) The rooms are fairly quiet inside, and we had a view of the top of the Eiffel tower and the courtyard which was nice.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a five minute walk from the Assembl\u00c3\u00a9e Nationale, and about 15 minutes from the Eiffel tower. Due to the presence of several embassies and diplomatic missions on surrounding streets and the proximity of the parliament, there is a very high visibility police presence, and the area is therefore probably relatively safe to walk in at night. We stayed here in November 2005, in a standard double room on the first floor. Despite being on a moderately busy street, there was no audible traffic noise at night. The room was small, but adequate, and well heated. The bathroom was also small but spotlessly clean. The bath had a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctelephone set\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 shower attachment, but there was no wall fitting on which to attach the shower, so I had to hold it while showering.
