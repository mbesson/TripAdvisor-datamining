Arrived on a Saturday night to find no lights in the bathroom- apparently not part of the room preparation routine. After an hour and several visits, a bulb was found and inserted. The hotel is under-maintained, threadbare, and reeks of an undercapitalized ownership unwilling to do the most basic maintenance. Carpets are worn through; fixtures are ten years past replacement date; the door to my room was streaked with paint by the kindergarten-aged painter who painted the door jamb without even bothering to open the door. The next day, no hot water. \"Sorry, we have no maintenance people here today.\" Out of luck. Monday morning, no hot water. \"Sorry, someone will come by eventually.\" Awesome. No hot water all day. Tuesday, no hot water in the morning, finally someone fixed the hot water, but no one from the front desk bothered to call to mention it. Was able to take a hot shower though- yee ha. Wednesday, no hot water. Called, got the \"oh sorry\", and an hour later it was fixed, again with no call to inform me. Took a shower and got the hell out. Did I mention the toilet seat couldn't be put up either? Great fun. Bottom line: This place is a dump. The main attendant at the front desk was aggressively obnoxious, wondering how I could possibly question why a maintenance person wasn't available on a Sunday. When I left, I waited for her to ask \"How was your stay\" so I could properly summarize the hotel's shortcomings, but alas, wasn't even asked. Avoid this dump like the plague. It's not even worth the GBP60 per night that I paid (never mind the rack rate of GBP675).", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southampton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDon't even consider it..\u201d", "Author": "katherine h", "ReviewID": "UR124688982", "Content": "My dad and I booked a twin room for one night at the Knightsbridge Green Hotel as part of our weekend in London. Got to the Hotel, the receptionist's fax machine ''had been on the blick all day'' so our reservation, we made two days previous, had not come through. As to why they have not had it fixed or got reservation details via email etc. we will never know. At first the receptionist was quite blunt and didn't seem to care how many hours we had traveled to find the hotel in the first place. Once we had stood there for the best part of an hour sorting this out, with many phone calls back and forth to Late Rooms (through no fault of theirs- fantastic website), we get our key. Then it just gets worse.. Lift was broken and wasn't fixed for our entire stay there, so we had to trek six flights of longs stair cases whenever we wanted to go in or out (but still with the smallest hope still in our minds we had the key to a fabulous room like we had seen in the advertisement pictures- and why we booked with this hotel). Anything but fabulous.. We unlocked the door, and what to others might not be an issue but is not what we were sold was a shockingly decorated room. Awful curtains and not modern at all. Stayed in better family run B&B's. The we slowly found the following problems.. - Cracks swarmed the 'living area's' ceiling. - 'Living area' was freezing cold- heater wasn't working. - The TV signal was rubbish, kept flickering and sound going off. - Lamp didn't work. - The bathroom door lock didn't work. - Wallpaper was coming off the walls. - Grime round the edge of the bath. - There was no main lights to the room, only lamps which wasn't enough light. - No milk for the tea. - Electrical plugs were tough to plug in our appliances. - Beds were uncomfortable, my dad didn't sleep much at all. - Breakfast is an extra \u00a314.99 per person (for a piece of bread and orange juice). Of course we didn't opt for their breakfast; found a lovely cafe 'EAT' around the corner, \u00a32.99 for more, nicer food. So, final summation: DON'T book with this hotel. If the problems i've listed above sound acceptable for a room that is up for reservations at \u00a3890 at a '4*' modern hotel then you need a serious re-think of values. Put a huge dampener on our trip and I really hope no-one has to go through the same disappointment.

It is a real disappointment. I cannot understand the reviewers who seem to think this is the hotel from hell. It is not that bad. It is not worth the money, but it is sure convenient and if you are only there for a couple of nights it is quite bearable. Because I knew the hotel from many years ago as a quiet well located boutique style hotel, I never checked for reviews. We arrived an hour before check in, it happens when you fly trans-Atlantic! The first surprise at check in are the published rack rates starting at around \u00a3600 per night, we had a three night stay for around \u00a3520. We were asked to leave our bags and come back in a couple of hours. The rates must be a hang over from when the hotel had some class! Our room had a sitting room and a bedroom with king size bed and an ensuite bathroom. The king sized bed meant that there was only one night table and the closet was almost inaccessible. Maybe that room is better suited to a queen size bed!The lighting in both rooms was with a 4 lamp strip of spotlights. Two were working in the living room and one ion the bed room. BY stacking furniture I was able to reach the lights and fiddling with them activated a third light in the living room which I removed and put in the bedroom set. We had requested bulb replacements but as this was now 4 hours later and after 6 o'clock I decided to sort it myself. The table in the living room seemed to be about to fall over however closer inspection revealed that 3 of the 4 screws holding the top on were backed out. A small screw driver and it was fixed as was the two hinges in the clothes closet. One problem that was not fixable by me or apparently housekeeping was the toilet! It could not flush completely and even after housekeeping had done the room, the evidence was still there, every day.! It appears that maybe housekeeping does not report faults to engineering or maybe they have found like we did that nothing happens. If the price were a little lower I might go back or if there were renovations done I would pay the same again. However I am more likely to go for the cheapest room over the road at the Mandarin!

We had a bit of a snafu with the booking through easytobook.com and ended up having the reservation cancelled...which we didn't find out about until we got there at 7p after travelling all day from Paris. The staff were very helpful in a stressful situation. We got *A* room but not *THE* room we were supposed. It was a \"Single-Double\" vs the \"Double-Double\" we paid for but they moved us to the MUCH bigger D-D room the next day. Which was great...untill the A/C didn't work. The staff addressed immediately by moving us again (pain in the butt having to repack up) -- INTO A SUITE!!! -- which we kept the duration of our week-long trip. The location of the hotel is excellent -- about 5m from the Knightsbridge tube stop and right across the street from the South edge of Hyde Park. This is a VERY POSH area of London; right across from the Rolex store and McLarran dealership; the Ferrari dealer is around the corner; a ton of boutiques, Gap, H&M, and Harrod's are all no more than 5m walk. Starbucks is around the corner; too many eateries to count, and security...I've never seen so many cops patrolling (and London has a ton of them). This was literally the day after the N. London riots so I'm guessing they were precautionary, but still, it is VERY SAFE. In addition, there are TWO pubs (they are chain pubs but nonetheless 2 of them!) right next door, annd another around the corner offering pretty good English food (I'm American and don't know whether it's \"proper British food\" but was what I expected) and decent rates. We also had dinner at the Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park Hotel and it was excellent without being overly pricey (on par with- though cheaper than a night at Morton's). Be advised: The hotel is currently being renovated. There was no obvious work going on while we visited but you can definitely tell that there are some areas that are in need of TLC. The rooms themselves were fairly modern. The furnishings are IKEA (i.e., they good but are not of the best quality) and have a very modern feel. As I mentioned the A/C units are in the process of being replaced -- the 1st and 3rd rooms had no problems. The bathrooms are spacious, offer full bathtubs with showers overhead and plenty of counter-space. The beds were fairly comfortable, above-average. The biggest down-side to this hotel is the internet. They have the router in the basement and the only place you can get wifi is in the lobby/lounge. VERY inconvenient for anyone NEEDING the internet extensively during their visit. There is limited space in this area as well. The other thing is that the internet has a tendency to drop off. A call to The Geek Squad would probably fix this issue but for whatever reason, it had not been done as of my check out. I am fairly meticulous about reading/ analyzing the reviews before booking and I did see some unfavorable reviews (or maybe \"less desirable\" is better). I would honestly say most of them seemed to be pretty over-blown based on my experience. For the rate we paid (about $150 US -- in AUG 2011), we totally got our money's worth -- even had we not gotten the suite. I have stayed in London before (in 2003 at a Holiday Inn near the British Museum) and this hotel was on par with the other place though the other place had a restaurant area (never did see -- or ask about eating at this place). Probably not a true 4-star hotel, but definitely 3+. I will definitely try to score a room here next summer for the Olympics.

Upon check in we saw that the usual room rates for a double room were \u00a3425 per night and with that in mind I can completely understand all of the previous poor reviews. However we paid a very low price for a clean, safe and relatively comfortable room in an excellent location. We stayed in room 45 which wasn't roadside and as such we had no problems with noise. The bed was relatively comfortable although the bedside table did fall apart just by touching it, thankfully reception were very understanding and didn't even contemplate trying to bill us. The shower in our room was good as was the level of cleanliness. The air conditioning was poor and might as well not been there. I don't think I would have cared had there not been a unit in the room but when there is and it doesn't work it becomes frustrating. As mentioned in other reviews breakfast is very very basic and we didn't get exactly what we ordered on either morning. The kitchen staff also seem to be confused between Assam and green tea. That said it was included in the price we paid and done just about enough to set us up for the day. The only other complaint I would have is that the decor is simply a veneer hiding some rather shoddy workmanship in these very clearly cheap rooms. In summary we paid a very reasonable price for a room we could be safe and comfortable in after spending a busy day and night in my favourite city, after all we didn't come to London to spend our time festering in a hotel room.

Staff lied to me about two issues - Wi-Fi in the hotel and availability of other rooms (a part time member of staff told me there were plenty rooms free while I was there). 2. This is a guest house, not a hotel - no bar, no dining room etc. 2. Wi-Fi was advertised in each room, there was none. One member of staff told me it not working in my room and it would be repaired later that day. The following day I mentioned it to reception again that it still wasn't working - listen to this - a different member of staff said - \"ok I'll be honest with you, it will be fixed on Thursday\". I was due to check out on Wednesday - how convenient! Three nights without any Wi-Fi. I was told that I could use it in the lobby, but guess what? The router was so old and therfore the signal was so bad I gave up browsing the internet in the \"hotel\". I used an internet cafe each day instead. 3. They had some large towels crumpled up on the carpet in my bedroom that were catching serious drips coming from the air conditioning unit when it was in operation. 4. The walls in the bathroom were filthy, I mean with grime and lots of old stains like shampoo splatters and toothpaste (painted walls) 5. The white light fitting in the bathroom buzzed constantly obviously due to faulty wiring and the light fitting was blackened around the bulbs from previous shorts or maybe the bulbs blowing. 6. Television - the most frustrating television set up I have ever come across, a member of staff came up to fix it and while he was there I asked him why is this place so poor. He said it was bought by someone who just let it go to rack and ruin, and that they were quite used to people complaining. He fixed the television for me (for your information I am in my 30's and I am quite competent when it comes to programming tvs etc but this tested my skills!!). 7. The coving in the ceiling was in very bad shape, the carpet was not vacuumed properly, lots of dust around the headboard of the bed. 8. \"Breakfast\" - delivered to your room - cold toast, yogurt was like out of date cream, milk was ok as it was in a packet, cereal was fine as it was out of a packet.

They had our contact number the whole time we had had the reservation and not once rang us to say we were being moved, or give us any kind of option. Not even an email. The hotel was not even full (no surprises given the quality) and yet we were moved 2 miles away. We were told we were being upgraded, which was blatantly untrue on arrival.

The hotel itself looked ok, but there were signs of wear on the carpets and as mentioned the lift was a bit outdated. Still on getting to our room we were pleasantly surprised. It was clean spacious and modern. Again some signs of wear and a few small easily fixable things, such as the light switch button was missing and there were cables untidly running to the tvs (yes we have 2 televisions, one in the bedroom and one in the lounge area) also the room looked like it had been decorated in a hurry, but overall it was nice. The bed was huge and very comfortable, it was 2 large singles pushed together but it didnt feel like it. The bathroom was clean, which was all my wife was concerned about and the shower although it looked like it might not work was actually very good. We were staying here out of necessity rather than desire, but i would say it was ok. There was no information about breakfast and when we called down to reception to ask about it at 9.15am we were told it finished at 9.30 so we didnt get time to find out what that was like, however i saw a tray being delivered to the room next door of what looked like a continental breakfast that would have been very acceptable.

In general the hotel is not four stars and don't know who in their right mind would give it that rating. Staff attitude was could not care less and to get them to provide cups for tea etc was a trial and 4 hours later cups still left on tables.

They offered to upgrade us to a luxury double with a sitting room for the same price. We had a look at the room which was at the back of the hotel - no view. It had no paintings or luxuries in it apart from T.V. The furniture was a bit cheap looking and there were no table or chairs to sit on to eat breakfast - only a sofa. On hindsight it was fairly comfortable. We got 2 free breakfasts thrown in as compensation as well. The first one they pulled off brilliantly, however, the second morning they managed to burn the toast, croissants and ommitted any plates or knives!! Not exactly too much to ask of them!

We were traveling with our 2 children, then 10 and 8, and needed a relatively spacious room without paying $1000 a night. We also wanted a central location and a clean hotel. The KG met and exceeded our requirements on every count. The hotel itself is located in Knightsbridge, 1/2 a block from Hyde Park (perfect for early evening pick-up \"football\" matches for my husband and son, and for relaxing walks along the lake and runs in the morning). It was also 1/2 block from Harrod's, right on the bus route to Kensington/Portobello Road, and in the othe direction to Trafalger Square/Picadilly/Covent Garden, a block from one of the main Tube lines (the one to Heathrow), and a pretty easy walk to Buckingham Palace and on to Westminster. We always felt very safe. The location simply couldn't have been better. The hotel itself is quite small, so the manager knows all his guests by name and interest. He couldn't have been more helpful in deciding what to do and where to go. The other staff were similarly helpful. Our room ended up being a small suite, with the living room turning into a bedroom each night (with a sofa bed and an added cot - great to avoid sibling squabbles). The bath was spacious, full of marble and very clean. By London standards, it was very reasonably priced - especially for the amount of room we had! Although this isn't a luxury hotel with tons of activities and other services, it was perfect for what we needed during our stay in London - a clean and comfortable place to spend the night in a terrific location and for a very reasonable (by London's outrageous standards) price.

I have read other reviews that said it was noisy, but we found the double windows (not double paned, but actually two windows, one inside the other) shut out a good portion of the noise if you can keep them closed. I think the lack of noise was also due to the fact that we were on the top floor. The room itself was quite large, which was especially nice with a teenager, but as noted by others, could stand updating. But one of the things we liked was that the bathroom was quite large and the sink was large enough to hold both our toiletries bags, so we weren't fighting for space. The staff was always very helpful and nice. The only thing I objected to was the price of the breakfast, which was \u00a37.50 per person. At the present exchange rate that was just about $15 per person, for a continental. It was \u00a312 for full English breakfast, & I refused to pay that.
