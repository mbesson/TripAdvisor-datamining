{"Reviews": [{"Content": "A Good Japanese Business Hotel Just spent 9 nights at this property. I booked this trip through Asiana Airlines, who offered such an unbelievable deal, I couldn't pass it up. Not the easiest hotel to get to from Narita. No airport limo bus to the area (that I could find). Probably the best would be JR to Tokyo Station, Yamanote Line 1 stop to Yurakucho station-Y18. (though it's a slightly long connection at Y18 and JR to Tokyo is kinda expensive). I tried to save money by taking the Keisi Oshiage line (transfer at Aota) to the Hanzomon to Yurakucho line, which took about 4 hours and was my first experience on the metro...talk about trial by fire). Really liked the proximity to the Tokyo Metro (exit 5 or 6 from Kojimachi -Y15 get you within 1/2 a block...hotel is on the street with the metal railing across from 7-11). My only slight complaint was the Yurakucho line required transfers to other Metro lines that got you to more interesting areas of the city (sometimes with really long walking connections as long as 585 Meters). Liked the free wi-fi in the lobby. Hotel staff was very nice and courteous, but didn't speak much English. Slight issue with the first room they gave me...I had requested non-smoking and they put me into a smoking room. After speaking on the phone with the front desk (they had to get me someone who speaks English) they tried to tell me that there weren't any non-smoking rooms available. After repeatedly saying that I would be physically ill if I had to stay in the room and asking when a non-smoking room would be available, they gave me one. It still had a slight smell of smoke, but was pretty tolerable. The room was very small (the twin bed took up about 2/3 of the space), but comfortable. High speed was free, but was hard wired Ethernet instead of Wi-Fi . Bathroom was pretty interesting (faucet was shared by the sink and hand shower). Shower curtain smelled horribly of mold. I normally would have complained, but I wouldn't begin to know how to...so I used the Green Tea Odor Removing spray (provided free in the closet area) which made it tolerable. Hotel is located in a super quiet area of Tokyo that felt very secure (there were guards across the street and next door 24 hours/day). If you're not going to make it back for the last train, make sure to grab the hotel's business card which has a map in Japanese for the taxi driver. Anticipate about a $15-20 (USD) taxi ride from many of the more lively areas of Tokyo. Overall: a few minor issues that were mostly resolved, but for one of the most expensive cities in the world, a fantastic deal.", "Date": "Nov 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR482594601", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "imnotsante"}, {"Content": "nice place i just got back from a 3 night stay at this hotel and came away impressed. i must say i was a little worried about not seeing any reviews when i booked the room a few months ago, but everything was great. the room was clean and the staff was friendly. the room was very small, but i believe most hotel rooms are in tokyo, especially under $100 per night. i was solo and spent much of my time exploring, not sitting in the room anyway. the subway is very close, and is 1 stop from a major station where you can transfer to many different lines and get all over tokyo easily.for directions on how to get to the hotel by subway, make sure that you take the 5th exit out of kojimachi station and go about 1 or 2 blocks down the one way street that looks like an alleyway on the other side of the road. the hotel will be on your left.there is also great little italian resturant on the corner by the subway exit. not much else around there, but again, your only a few stops from ginza, roppongi, or tokyo stations. i would definately stay there again.", "Date": "Oct 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR968832136", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "douglasohl"}, {"Content": "\u9479\ue218\u4eb8\u9352\u2543\u6564\u9287\u693c\u4ef8\u9287\u52e9\u4f28\u9287?#x201d;   showReview(21396413, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR871899644", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "TEFU1073"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066443-d658580-r21834793-Tokyo_Green_Palace-Chiyoda_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "658580", "Price": "$180"}}
