The rooms are old, but clean, private bathrooms, and they will bring breakfast to your room in the morning. Close by are several cafes with Cafe de Jaren right across the river, with a beautiful terras on the water. Just out the front door is Mulligan's Irish Music bar, a fun place, and down the way is Rokerij coffeeshop. Surrounded by much nightlife activities the area is a little noisy, but not a major problem in the room I was in. They have vending machines in the lobby with bier in them, a great bonus when returning to your room after 3am and the cafes are closed.

The room is very small, although almost clean (I say \"almost\" because the pillow covers and the blanket smell like somebady has been there before me). The bathroom is fine and clean, but small for big persons (I'm a small person, so I didn't have any troubles). The towels have some intrigating stains... If you are very picky, bring your own (I wish I had done that!). It is true they don't change the sheets nor the towels, but if you ask them to do it, they'll do it. Towels hanged means you don't want to replace them, but if they are in the floor, then it means your wanna change them. My room had three bulb lights. Two at the sides of the bed and one in the ceiling. This very last didn't work. Neither the tv. There are two small mirrors: one in the bathroom and one in the bedroom. They are very small, so you won't be able to see how you look, if that concerns you.

You'll have to do that probably two or three more times if the number of your room is beyond number 3 or 4. So be prepared. Breakfast is served in your room. You set up the hour the day before. For breakfast you'll have a pice of bread, one portion of butter, a small portion of jam, one portion of instant cofee, one portion of sugar, one tea bag, a youghourt and a pot of hot water. Personally, I didn't find it bad at all, but if you are use to big breakfast, it would be a wise idea to go to another hotel. There is a club downstairs that gets pretty noisy. YES, you'll hear it: the glasses of the window, and the mirrors vibrate. Be prepared: the noise stops at 4 am.

Hotel Monopole is run by an unreliable non-Dutch citizen (not related to origin; I'm married to a non-Dutch myself) having the very unpleasant policy to rip off potential clients through their creditcards (card no. and date of validity as booking deposit) as well as the ones that actually check in and stay at the place (read other reviews). To make sure my husband and I would have a room in A'dam for our 5 day-stay, we initially made (well in advance; two months before flying in) a reservation with Monopole as well as with two other A'dam-based hotels to decide later on which one we would take. There we already faced a 'misunderstanding' regarding the room price: we especially asked for the 95 Euro's room price advertized on all tourist websites and were surprized when the hotel confirmed our reservation (email) in which it mentioned 105 Euro's for the room per night; we had to especially ask them to set the record straight. Chosing our final hotel wasn't too much of a hard choice and ending up at this website which allowed us to read the negative comments about Monopole (below) didn't complicate matters. I thought picking up the phone would be the fastest way to cancel our reservation (as I speak Dutch); it was kind of a surprise to find a female employer who didn't speak a word of Dutch. In English (not very well either) she assured me it wasn't necessary to mail a written confirmation of my cancellation as we were far (5 weeks) ahead from the 48 hours deadline and our initial day of arrival; she would simply take note and skip our reservation...that same night I cancelled two other A'dam-based hotels (Agora and Lieve Nachten) by phone without any problem. Just imagine our astonishment when our monthly creditcard bill of last February showed a debit advice of 105 Euro's for the account of Hotel Monopole on our initial day of arrival; the hotel claims we never cancelled the room ('we can't find anything about your cancellation call in our administration') and says it has been obliged to debit one night according to the '48 hours rule'.

My heart sank when we got a look at the first room; a small, dank place with twin cots, dirty marks on one wall, a tatty thin carpet, old fixtures and fittings and a unpleasant view of what appeared to be an industrial building with a grimy roof. The second room three floors up a break- neck stairs into the attic, was similar to the first but icy cold and dull in the day time, with more dirty marks and a fist-sized hole in one wall. The single sheets which covered the matresses seemed clean but the lank duvets on top looked like they hadn't been washed in several weeks; there was a dark brown cigarette burn hole in one. Having viewed the warm and inviting looking rooms on their website, my friend and I were quite upset about the arrangement. When I asked to be moved from the attic to another room, I was told that we had gotten a special offer and that 'rooms in this part of Amsterdam generally go for &#8364;90 or more'. We had to lug our own bags to our rooms. That night we discovered that the club behind (ironically called 'Escape' - at this stage I wanted to) had little to no sound-proofing and that it went on until 4.30am (bar Mondays when it shut its doors at 2am). Strangely, the hotel Monopole makes no mention of this or the bar/club right next door to them on their website. On the third evening when we arrived back at the hotel, we found our towels hadn't been changed, or rooms/ toilets cleaned or toilet rolls replaced. In fact the only thing touched and removed was the cups we had requested (much to their astonishment) the night before. Some kind of hammering and building was going on in one of the rooms for much of the time we were there (daytime only). My view of Amsterdam was sullied by the very poor accomodation and lax approach offered at the hotel Monopole. However, aside from the hotel, I did get to see beautiful Dutch architecture, ground-breaking painting, creative theatre, layers of history and the wonderful buzz of such a diverse European city.", "Date": "October 16, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "cleveland, ohio, USA", "Title": "\u201conly if you are unconscious\u201d", "Author": "whippoboy", "ReviewID": "UR1384064", "Content": "I spent two nights at the Hotel Monopole in late Sept. 03, based on two fairly good reviews that I had found. My room was for 75 Euros which I knew was not the best but....... The room was dumpy, had no view and no inroom bath (the latter I expected). However, as far as I know, there was no shower to share nearby so only an inroom sink in which to wash. Small toilet was outside the door. In addition, contrary to what is said, there is no breakfast served. Worse (at least for me) was the fact that the Hotel is flush up against a club that goes until 4 a.m. so unless you're going to be out that late, you can forget about sleep. Very bad security policy as they PUT THE NAME OF THE HOTEL AND YOUR ROOM NUMBER ON THE KEY CARD apparently as a convenience to the clientele (and obviously to anyone who finds your card). I was charged 20 Euros for a lost key card on the grounds that they would have to redo the entire system because of their idiotic policy. In addition, I was initially told they did not have a duplicate to lend to me (apparently as some sort of punishment for having lost the card) so my hours were restricted to those of the staff. Turned out this was not true as they did have another card. This place is basically a flop house where you can come back to pass out in mid-morning. I can't imagine why anyone would choose it over a hostel.", "Date": "October 10, 2003"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Monopole", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d273176-Reviews-Hotel_Monopole-Amsterdam_Noord_Holland.html", "Price": "$99 - $231*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Amstel 60</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Amsterdam</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">1017 AC</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">The Netherlands</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "273176", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/63/98/6398d32a1df57e7732848696236333a03large.jpg"}}
