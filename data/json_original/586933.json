The hotel was impeccable, the rooms large and comfortable, the staff could not do enough for us. We were a party of 5 with 3 rooms and saw both double and single rooms. A beautiful breakfast was laid every morning with made to order cappucino, espresso, Cafe Americano and it was great coffee!! The staff was able to answer any question we posed regarding major locales in Venice and most of the time was able to give us specific direction as to how to get there. They shared with us some of the little Venetian secrets that most tourists never find out about - places for great wine tasting, restaurants where no one speaks anything but Italian and the food was to die for.

This boutique hotel is definitely modern and clean with a very neat design aesthetic. We stayed in the \"white room\" and it was the nicest room we stayed in on our journey. Because the room looks out onto a dark, grungy alleyway, we decided to keep the windows closed to prevent any mosquitoes from coming in. FYI, when the windows are closed (and the lights are out), the room gets pitch dark. It's like sleeping in a tomb, so consequently we slept well! Plus, the \"white room\" is between floors 1 and 2, so you don't have any neighbors on either side and there's no need to worry about thin walls. There's a laundromat about 2 minutes away that we found easily thanks to directions from our front desk receptionist. Our breakfasts were the most basic ones we had in our travels, but that's Venice for you (i.e. the dollar gets you very little in this extremely expensive city). The hotel was very clean and the bathroom was easy to maneuver in, even considering the typical small sizes in Europe. We were about a 2 minute walk from St. Mark's square, so we were close to the action with half the price-tag. There was also free wi-fi we could use in the rooms and it worked well. There is an elevator in the hotel, which apparently is uncommon in this old city, so it's handicap accessible. Lastly, there's a pharmacy nearby on the way to the laundromat. TIP #1: The front door to the hotel is a clear glass sliding door with an electronic keypad. Your room key opens it but when first arriving to the hotel, simply ring the doorbell and the receptionist (located on the 2nd floor) will open the door for you. Walk up the 2 flights of stairs to the receptionist's desk. Odd layout that might confuse some. TIP #2: If you pay in cash (i.e. not with a credit card), they'll give you a discount.

It was in a great location, only 2 minutes from St. Mark's Square, the room was really nice; it had a big bed, fridge, safe, flat screen TV and a really nice bathroom. It's pretty much everything you could hope to find in Venice at a very good price. The only reason I couldn't give this hotel a 5 out of 5 is because of what happened at checkout. When we had checked in and signed everything and turned our passports in, the guy at the counter said \"you don't need to pay now, you pay with cash when you checkout\". Well when he said it I heard him say the word cash, but I assumed it was kind of lost in translation and he just meant you had to pay when you checked out, which is what we had done at the hotel we had stayed at in Tuscany. But when we checked out, it was truly cash only, which I'm sorry, that is totally unacceptable for a nice hotel. Nobody wants to be carrying tons of cash on them when travelling in Europe because of pickpockets and to have to turn over 400 euros to pay for the hotel kind of sucked. It was at the end of our stay in Italy and I had to sprint down to St. Mark's Square and find an ATM to get more cash out and sprint back so we could make it to the train. But other than that I would absolutely recommend this hotel, the staff was great to us, the breakfast was pretty good, and like I said, the room is everything you could hope for in Venice.

It was a little hard to find at first, but most places in Venice are! Dario (I think), was absolutely a gem.

He also gave us a great introduction to the area and some tips on things to do, where to go, etc. from the hotel. Although his Italian accent was thick, we still could understand him and appreciated the time he took to make us feel welcome. The hotel is beautifully decorated, very elegant and classy. Our room (top 3rd floor), was up a very steep flight of steps, but we were ok with it as we're in good shape (there is one elevator you can use but the steps were quicker). Our room was beautiful as well, spacious, and a pretty good view out on the rooftops of Venice. Bathroom was nice, although I couldn't figure out the hairdryer. Also, we had a little issue with the shower not draining well, but not a huge issue (and this might just be an overall issue in Venice as the city is sinking?). Bed was big and comfy. We were surprised with a free breakfast for us the morning we had to leave...especially since we left EARLY to catch a train to our next destination. This was of course the typical European stuff - cafe, juice, croissants, etc., but perfect to get us going and off on a good note. It was a special treat. We spent most of our time out and about on the tiny streets exploring Venice, and it is a CHARMING, romantic, MAGICAL city. I would go back in a heartbeat. We were there for 2 days, and I think we covered most of the big sites and wandered enough to feel like we did what we wanted, but I wouldn't have turned down another day to just wander the streets, eat gelato, drink more wine and great food. I could give you a few names of places to go for great food, but there are SO MANY places and it's a little difficult to navigate, so I'd recommend just hitting the streets, wandering, and stopping wherever you think looks good...you won't be disappointed! (And encountering St. Mark's Square late at night will give you a big surprise - it floods! A couple inches, but it's a bittersweet reminder that the city of \"elegant decay\" really is sinking.

Breakfast is served in the elegantly transformed lobby with that same personal touch. Coffee and juices, yogurt and cereals are served with charm and generosity. The hotel is encapsulated in an old building totally redecorated and transformed within the last several years. There are signs of the age in the preserved ceiling beams and location, but the room are well furnished and comfortable with lush fabrics and fine materials. The baths, too, are modern and fully functional. All rooms, as well as the lobby, are on the second and third floors of the building, up a flight of marble steps or in a somewhat slow glass elevator (very handy with luggage!).

The staff was extremely courteous and helpful and the room was immaculate. We were given the option of having breakfast brought to our room, free of charge which was wonderful.

The bathroom was a one-of-a-kind. . .It was really nice, sheek, and modern with uplighting on the bathtub. The room and bathroom were spotless and very comfortable. The hotel itself was beautiful and the staff was very friendly. Everyone provided us with great recommendations and tips on getting around the town.

It is close to everything . . . a few blocks from the Piazza San Marco, Grand Canal, Ponte di Rialto. Even better was the fact that there was a market a few doors down. We ran out of toothpaste so I was able to get it there as well as other goods (bread, sodas, water, etc.). We highly recommend this hotel to all of our friends and family. We will definitely be returning to Venice and when we do. . . you can bet that we will be staying at the Relais Venezia again! Tip 1: Before your arrival to Venice, definitely ask the hotel staff to give you detailed directions on getting to hotel. It was a little confusing in getting to the hotel (especially when you are carrying luggages) so we did get a little lost. Then again, you are always lost in the streets of Venice!
