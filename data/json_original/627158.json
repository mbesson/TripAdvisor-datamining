Hotel is clean and comfortable, supported with politely staff ready to help and provide you with useful advises and information. You shouldn't expect some special view from rooms, but the restaurant on the roof gives you a beautiful view on the entire Istanbul. Food is also great (with regard to breakfast, cause I paid only for B/B) There is only one PC in the hotel (this is disadventages), with not to fast internet connections, so you often have to wait for your turn to use it. Location is the best thing about this hotel. It is placed in the Sirkeci district, very close to the Aya Sofia, Topkapi Palace, Kapali market (5 minutes walking distance), tram station (lines to to: Taxim-Ortakoy cami-Fenerbahce and so on, or lines to Sultanahmet-Topkapi-Kapali-metro). Hotel is also very close to train stations. The location is in the old district of Istanbul, so you have to be careful and to take account on the tourist hunters. Of course, you shouldnt be afraid of it, because everywhere in the old part of city, there is a lot of tourist as well as lot of people selling some things, asking for tip etc. Hotel has couple of facilities. There are a sauna, turkey bath, massage and a small pool devoted to sauna and turkey bath program. It doesnt looks modern and exclusive but you should visit. Environment and appearance of the hotel are not promising anything special. Street where the hotel is placed looks dark and narrow, but its safe. Nevertheless, I like this hotel. If I paid it more than I did, probably I wouldnt be to much satisfied.

The staff at the hotel werent very helpful apart from a couple of exceptions and it was hard work trying to get any information or assistance out of them at times. In some there ways there was a slight resemblence to Fawlty Towers in the way it was run almost as if they were not used to tourists.

You could here the phones in the other rooms nearby also ringing at 7.

On our first day we were given a card to slot into your door to enable you to get into your room. We presumed this would be for the duration of our stay. However, for the first couple of days we walked right past reception and they just smiled at us while we went into the lift (Which didnt always work!) to the fourth floor and found out the card didnt work once input. We would then take it back and they would enable it for us again. This happened for three days until we realised we had to do this every day. We had no information in our room as to any rules or what was available. The cleaners were prompt, actually very prompt! They would sometimes leave their cleaning cloth in the room and even found the top sheet disappearing one day and pushed under the bed! on the plus side if you needed a wake up call apart from 7 o clock they were good at doing that for you and the porter seemed pleasant on the first day but didnt really see him again after that. The room was adequate enough with a fridge and a television and also had a modern shower so no qualms there.
