{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Lovely Gardens This is a small friendly hotel, with most of the rooms set around the lovely swimming pool. The staff were very pleasant and helpful. The gardens were beautifully maintained and it is only a 2 min walk to the beach and restaurants. Downfalls were the mozzies in the cottage rooms and the music playing nearby at night.", "Date": "Dec 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR164098658", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Mandaranda"}, {"Content": "Noisy I stayed to Satriya Cottages few days this june 2008. The place is nice and most of the staff friendly BUT if you want to spend some quiet time, it's not the place to go. Every nite, you can hear an open air discotheque located not far from the hotel till after 5 a.m. So bring your ear plug. When i was at the pool during the afternoon, they put hard rock music loud. I asked the staff at the pool bar to change or stop the music as we don't like this type of music but he replied to me that one person asked to put this CD and he called the manager. I explained to the manager that my mum 69 yr old and even me  my wife wanted to relax and really didn't like hard rock music and it was already for a while but he told me as some other persons wanted, he wouldn't stop. I've seen the people ordered many beers, that's why he didn't care of other guests. I left the hotel the next day.", "Date": "Jun 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR818128042", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "PETE1KL"}, {"Content": "Hotel with discrimination I stayed in Satriya on 14 oct to 16 oct 2007. I have no choice, because other hotel in Kuta are fullybooked. The location is only walking distance to Kuta beach. It also has nice tropical garden, but the room itself is not clean. If you walk bare foot in the room, your feet would become dirty. Eventhough the room service cleaned the room on the next day, still I found the floor was dirty. The bed has a cracky sound when you move on it and the bedsheet look old with yellowish white color. They served very standard breakfast (noodle, rice, bread, bacon and egg) but not very nice service to local tourist like me. The staff greet all caucasian tourist good mornig with a nice smile but not to us. That's not it. The reservation desk also not very friendly to local tourist. When I asked an envelope for the bill, the staff threw the envelope with his left hand, which is not polite for Indonesia culture. So...definitly I will not comeback to this hotel anymore. I moved to Aston Inn Tuban on 16 oct. With the same price, Aston give much much better service.", "Date": "Oct 24, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR449990825", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "BungaJakarta"}, {"Content": "Caution!

This is my 4th visit to Bali, and as a woman travling alone I always enjoy the 5 star service I recive at the Satriya hotel. The hotel has all you need; a wonderful restaurant with great quality and prices. Breakfast buffet is always inclded with your stay. The hotel has a beautiful pool wonderful spa services and an unbeliable garden with a pond filled with koi.The rooms are huge with a.c. , t.v, and a small fridge. Also if you bring your lap top you can connect in your room. THe bathroom is very spacious, but no bath tub. One of the best parts is the location , one block from the beach and centraly located for shopping and nite life. I will stay at Satriya Cottages every time i visit Bali . I have found o wonderful Balinese experience there.", "Date": "Dec 16, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR365350248", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "seadragon"}, {"Content": "Quality in Kuta This year I stayed at Satriya Cottages for the 3th time.The hotel has an excellent location and is well run by a friendly and professional staff.Next to the hotel is the 2 floor open hotel restaurant with a broad choice of meals ranging from Indonesian and Japanese food to hamburgers and steaks. All good quality and with prices similar to everywhere else in Kuta. Inside the restaurant there is a small bar, where you can enjoy a beer or nice cocktail. Next to the restaurant is a silver shop/dvd rental/bike rental place with 2 highspeed internet terminals. Breakfast for hotel guests is served every morning in this restaurant, but I never attended breakfast, so I cannot comment on the quality of it.Upon check-in your recieve a welcoming drink with a Balinese flower on top, which is a great welcome after a long flight from Europe.The name suggest cottages, but there are only a few of those as it is more like a normal hotel with 2 main buildings.I stayed in superior room now for the 3th time. The rooms are clean and spacious with tv, ac and fridge. There are even bigger rooms available, but these are to big for me as I'm only alone.Bathroom is basic but clean, although on my last visit the shower holder fell off the wall.This was fixed instantly after mentioning it to the reception.Room cleaned every morning with new sheets, fresh flowers and 2 big towels.Room service possible straight from the restaurant.There is a big pool with sunken bar open until around 10pm. A small part of the pool is reserved for young children.Free pool towels available and plenty of chairs around the pool.Also free pool/billiart table onsite and a massage salon/service available all day for a small charge.The garden with all kinds of flowers, plants and palmtrees is very nice and also beautifuly lit at night.Security and parking spaces in front of the hotel and direct access to Poppies 2. Walking to the beach for surfing, sunset or relaxing only 1 minute! Shopping, bars and restaurants aplenty in every street around the hotel.It is definitely no party hotel and very quiet during the evening, night and morning.Best hotel for a reasonable price I have stayed in during my visits to Bali.Will stay in Satriya again next time....", "Date": "Dec 5, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR650600466", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Haak"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297697-d634101-r23005660-Satriya_Cottages-Kuta_Bali.html", "HotelID": "634101", "Price": "$60"}}
