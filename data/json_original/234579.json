The staff were very friendly. The room we had (2nd floor) didn't have a balcony but it had a direct view to the old part of the Sant Pau hospital which is a UNESCO heritage site. The room and bathroom were fairly big and comfortable. Very clean also. Air-conditioning is available but we didn't need to use it in April. The only issue with this hotel is that walls seem to be made of cardboard - you can very easily hear when your neighbors are having a shower. The windows didn't quite succeed in isolating from the street noise also. The first night it felt quite noisy, but the next nights I didn't have any problem with the noise as we were so tired of walking around Barcelona that it was not a problem to fall asleep at all. The hotel does have a cafeteria next to the reception which also serves as a restaurant - we had dinner there twice. There is a daily menu which is not very versatile but it was very well prepared and a big plus is that the restaurant is open till midnight. We had a late arrival from the airport and we could still have a decent dinner at the hotel. Pricing is very good - 11 EUR per person for a three course meal. Hotel breakfast is also very good although the same every day - continental type... but with some nice additions as fruit salad which was very nice. Free WI-FI access is also available on request at the reception. Barcelona touristic maps are waiting for you in the room and also at the reception. Sant Pau subway station is a 5-minute walk away where you can easily go to the city center in no more than 20 minutes. A bus stop is available just opposite the hotel but we preferred to use the subway. Gaudi's Sagrada Familia is on a 15-minutes walking distance.

We of course knew where the hotel was located when we booked it, but we felt like we lost too much time \"commuting\". A nice sight is the hospital Sant Pau right in front of the hotel - they were remodeling during our stay but it still looked nice. The room was nice and clean, though.

I recommend this, as Barcelona is a sprawling city and you get an outdoor flavor of the city with the tourbus. The Amrey is modern and clean. Front desk staff is courteous and friendly. The room we had was a fair size with a full bathtub. Our room faced the main road and had a nice size balcony with a lovely view. You may want to ask for extra pillows. Not many frills, but adequate. Wifi is free, but you have to get the access code from the front desk. We enjoyed the small outdoor cafe the hotel offers. You basically order at the bar and they bring the meal out to you or you can eat in the dining area. A very efficient and friendly waitress/cook named Michaela should be commended for her exemplarly work in the hotel's cafe. We did not partake in the hotel's breakfast, as they charged 9 Euros, which seemed rather steep. The dinner menu was affordable and the food was good. Coffee is good and fairly priced.

When we got to hotel, reception was very warm and friendly. We asked for a room facing the Hospital de Sant Pau and the receptionist reassured us that he had a good room for us. The room was on the top floor and from there up another flight of steps which initially got me slightly concerned. But we opened the room - it was good size, cozy, good double bed and the bathroom/toilet was immaculate. The best bit was - I thought it was just going to be a little window facing the beautiful Sant Pau hospital - but upon drawing the curtains, we stepped onto a wide balcony with chairs and table to lounge on whist taking in the amazing view. The reception later pointed us to a few tapas bars nearby as that was what we meant to go to Spain for. The tapas, as I had anticipated, were divine. I knew the Sagrada Familia was within walking distance from the hotel but in fact it was only about 10mins walk away. So I'd say a superb location in that respect. However it in the centre (La Rambla) where everything is but it's only a few metro stops away. Bought the T-10 ticket based on Tripadvisor advise as well which served us very well indeed. The only thing was that personally, we like thicker/bigger pillows as the ones in the room were slightly flat. Nonetheless we asked the reception for extra pillows which they graciously obliged us with. Also could do with slightly better directions to the hotel on the website (although it was relatively easy to find on Googlemaps). Finally, perhaps the hotel could consider room service? Also very impressive was that the room was cleaned everyday when we were away - they never disturbed us when we were in the room but once we got back from city sightseeing, it's like little elves had come to clean the room. Superb. Overall I have to say, the hotel was absolutely superb - all the basic things you need from a hotel. Good value for money (for Barca standards and close to town and on Easter weekend!)

We also had a TV with cable (various spanish and catalan stations plus a few international ones - cnn, bbc, tv5 etc). We had an included a buffet breakfast, with plenty food on offering. On the downside, the room we stayed in was a bit noisy as it faced the street and the hotel is situated next to the Sant Pau Hospital, Also, please don't try the pizza at the cafeteria, as this is the place in which we ate the most dreadfull pizza ever. Maybe the other items in the menu are better (pasta, sandwiches, etc) Overall we are very happy with this hotel and we will probably use it again in the future.", "Date": "February 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alexandria, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cBetter than most 3-stars\u201d", "Author": "BASWIMMER", "ReviewID": "UR11102784", "Content": "This hotel is better than most 3-star hotels and even some 4-star hotels at which I have stayed in Europe. The hotel is very clean and the room is comfortable. It is not a luxury hotel, but it meets the basic needs. The TV has CNN and BBC. I found no noise problem. It is a couple of blocks to a Metro station, and within walking distance to the Sagrada Familia. There are various restaurants in the area. The front desk people all wear business suits, and are professional and courteous. Barcelona is a great vacation destination. I plan to go back during the summer when it is warmer and more festive.", "Date": "November 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seville, Spain", "Title": "\u201cNot bad\u201d", "Author": "ibtzq", "ReviewID": "UR10031850", "Content": "I spent 4 days here last September.
