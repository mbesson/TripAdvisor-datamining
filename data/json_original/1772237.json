He then left, saying he would be back (???). I dressed and went to the front desk and asked for an explanation. I asked his name. I asked for the manager. I asked for the manager's name. I asked for a refund. He would give me nothing, but said I could move to another room (in the middle of the night with lots of luggage). By the way, these rooms have no phones and the silverware was missing from the kitchen. The bathroom door is supposed to have 5 panels of glass, but ours had only the top 4. The bottom glass panel was broken out when we arrived, obviously because the door opens into the toilet. There were holes in the walls around the switch-plates, as the construction crew failed to pay attention to details. Some of the lights in our room did not work - the lights were blown and never replaced. The \"black-out\" curtains did not cover all the windows, so we had some penetrating beams of light from the city all night.

The hotel room was more per night than we would usually pay, but my boyfriend was keen to check out this quirky boutique hotel. We arrived at the hotel at 3pm. The receptionist was friendly and promptly got us checked in. We were then shown to our room by a man we assumed to be the hotel manager, or perhaps owner. He told us about the hotel. That it opened in 2010 and it was popular with celebrities and politicians, suggesting quality and luxury. We were taken down to the second floor in a freight elevator which had been furnished to look like a sitting room. We both had smiles on our faces as we enjoyed the novelty.

As it was a treat organised by my boyfriend, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to be negative about the room, but once we were alone he said he was disappointed too. I went to use the bathroom, and when I noticed there was a tile missing behind the bathroom door and paint on the floor, it helped me make my decision to complain. At reception I spoke to the manager who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d shown us to our room. I said we were disappointed because we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the quality of the room reflected the rate we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d paid. He was very calm and polite (like me, I hope). He told me he was very sorry, but the hotel was full, but after a bit more discussion he said he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d see what he could do. Five to 10 minutes later, he came back and said there was another room we could have, and he showed me to an enormous suite on the fourth floor. My boyfriend and I were really pleased with the huge bathroom with a double-width shower and standalone bath; seating area with two sofas, an armchair and a coffee table; and the biggest softest bed. We had a comfortable stay, but if I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m honest I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think I would stay at the Loft Hotel again.

Not sure what the regular rates were but we paid 219 CAD excl. tax for an urban loft (guess they might have hiked the prices up for Canada Day!).

He took us on the freight lift which they converted into a funky boudoir like room which they apparently hire out for small parties...really whacky!

I could tell my g/f was a little disappointed. If we'd have paid $100-150 then we would have probably just taken it on the chin but as it was I think we both felt a little short changed. Anyway, my g/f headed back to reception to confess that we both felt really disappointed with the room. The hotel initially played the old 'We're fully booked' card but soon after the gentleman trudged off to 'see what he could do.' He came back shortly later and confessed he had another room for us (#406). \"So you like nice bathrooms?\" he said as he opened the door. This room was awesome...chandeliers, leather couches, drinks trolleys, you name it! Oh and the bathroom...a huge stand alone bathtub was the icing on the cake.

I have to say this was my most enjoyable stay at any hotel to date, and I am a frequent traveller, averaging over 50,000 miles a year. I come to Montreal at least 4 times a year, so I have spent a few too many nights at hotels in my life. So why did I like this specific property so much? Firstly, let's start with first impression and looks. As someone who loves good modern/contemporary design, when I first set my eyes on the lofts in this hotel, I was blown away. The lofts are a page out of Wallpaper. Whoever designed these apartments deserves an award. Old, industrial loft charm with high end, modern, designer furniture and new appliances, all very tastefully put together, down to the colour of and art on the walls. I liked it so much that I immediately started snapping pictures thinking this is how my next apartment is going to look like. The lofts are very spacious, giving you \"the dream apartment away from my apartment\" feel, if that makes sense. Secondly, the staff. Unlike the typical, overly professional and somewhat depersonalized treatment one would get at a typical 5 star hotel (and yes this is the league we should be referencing this hotel to), the staff here totally go out of their way to help and make sure a client enjoys their stay. They are relaxed, friendly, and always took care of even the smallest detail on the spot. They take their time with each customer so you feel like you're talking to a friend who genuinely cares whether you enjoy your stay or not. Thirdly, comfort. The beds and furniture in these apartments are very comfortable, so it's not just all image and no substance, and believe me I've stayed at quite a few of those even in Montreal, where it's like my sofa is great to look at but not to sit on. This adds up to comfy stay and good night sleeps. Finally, location. The loft is situated right on Montreal's busiest entertainment, bar, cafe and restaurant street, without the street noise. Why? The hotel is on a tiny street right off St Denis called terrace St Denis, it was done in a strange way where you technically are right on St Denis, you see it out of your window, but its built a level above the street and you have to take a little ramp to get to it. I have to admit that when I first looked at this hotel's reviews before I moved in, I was taken back by the more negative reviews on here. Having stayed here for 2 months, I feel compelled to address some of these issues if anything out of courtesy to the bold step taken by the owners and staff to bring this project to life: Yes, the hotel is new. It's 1 yr old now. There are a couple of details that still need a work out. 1- The phones, yes, there are no phones here in the rooms. Yet that is. While that didn't bother me because I got myself a tourist pre-paid cell phone for 30 bucks a month, I can see why it would bother someone who's here for 2 nights. But the hotel is having them installed shortly. Secondly, yes, there is no big restaurant and the breakfast area is small, again, this is because the hotel is new and this is in the works, but, you're right on St Denis and there is every type of food you can dream of within 2-5 minutes of walking, some open 24/7. 3- The noise: I haven't experienced this since I got here, there haven't been any parties and I see a security guy twice my size walking around the corridors at night to make sure all is quiet and safe (and I'm 6'2'' so imagine what he looks like). I do understand however from the staff that they did have issues with noise in the past because people would throw loud parties, while now they don't tolerate that anymore (though get togethers and dinners are fine, i.e. they haven't gone to the other extreme). I think it's only normal that with lofts this spacious and well designed, guests would have been inspired to throw a party and invite everyone they can think of to their place, it does look better than most clubs or bars. But again, this hasn't happened in my 2 months here. All in all, while there was a noise problem that's no longer there, and while the features I mentioned above are still in the works, everything else more than makes up for this, and I am never booking another hotel in Montreal. In sum, the owners and management decided to build a project that raised the bar in Montreal's hotel industry. Typically, good hotels offer comfort, convenience and luxury, while sacrificing space. Here, you're getting a real loft apartment, fully equipped, with the same comfort, luxury and location as a trendy 5 star hotel, and a staff that cares. While a couple of the convenience factors like phone and room service are still in the works, I think this property already beats any where I've ever stayed, and once the missing features are installed, well, suck to own another hotel because the bar's been totally raised.", "Date": "June 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa", "Title": "\u201cNOT SAFE, might be nice rooms but...\u201d", "Author": "yowtravellers", "ReviewID": "UR105634581", "Content": "To All Woman travelling Alone - Do not go to this boutique hotel.

The Loft actually worked well for me as I was traveling with my daughter and her girl friend and needed two rooms in walking distance with enough space so they wouldn't get on each others nerves. The Loft actually turned out to be a perfect choice. BUT I would not stay here on a business trip, or if I was traveling with less adventurous tourists. The Hotel is actually a converted parking garage of some sort. Most rooms come equipped with a full kitchen with new appliances so you can eat in if you like. The continental breakfast they claim to offer makes Hampton Inn seem like a gourmet restaurant so bring food or be preapred to go out for a hearty breakfast if you want more than fruit loops, granola or danish. There is a good breakfast spot down the hill on St Denis that I recommend for a quick breakfast. But the very positive side is the rooms are quite, quite large. The room I stayed in was huge - so much in fact that I had to deal with an echo when I was using skype for a call. However your experience in this hotel is dependent on the room you get. The pictures on their site are accurate (for some rooms) but do not necessarily reflect all. SO here are the details. Once you find the hotel, which in itself can be a challenge as it is tucked away on a side street off of a main drag, you walk into a lobby that will immediately let you know you are not in your typical hotel. I have stayed in Hampton Inns and Four Seasons around the world and I recognize the hotel experience well. The Loft hotel break that perception from the start. Check in was quick, flawless as we were greated by a cheery young woman sittng at a desk in the lobby that reminded me of Ikea style furniture. She had a laptop a folder with check in detail and that was it. After check in I unloaded the bags (for myself and 2 young girls (18)) into the lobby. They were loaded on a traditional bell cart and rolled out to the elevator where I was informed I would be staying n the lower floors. OKAY! Next we waited for the elevator to take us down two levels. It tooks some time to arrive and had a sofa in it and two chairs. The elevator obviously was built to hoist cars because its size was about the size of hotel rooms I have stayed in on Central Park South in New York. Once we boarded we descended two flights and came out in what seemed to be the basement or basement like setting. The halls reminded me of an institution (hospital, mental or other). But I was still interested and enjoying the innovative approach. Wondering what was next. The first room, my daughter's, was huge. Complete with full kitchen, area for watching TV, King Size bed, surronded by windows with a decent sized bathroom - sparse but functional accomodations. It was actually perfect. Livable for these two friends with enough space for each to wander and operate separately. It was well lit BUT cold. There was a standalone heater in the room and a wall unit that was not really functioning well. The view from the room? Well luckily the curtains are floor to cieling. Back alleys are not that picturesque even in Montreal. My room was next to that one. It was also huge. very sparsly furnished, with a monesary feel, with a concrete floor with cracks that reminded me of my basement back home in New England. The bed was firm and comfortable. The dining table was central, with four chair and large enough for a family to sit and enjoy meals. There was a sitting area for watching the flat screen wall mounted TV. The bathroom was a good size also. To be honest this was perfect for me - especially at the discounted rate I got for the two rooms. Although I noticed the peeling paint on the concrete post, the pipes that ran through the room that provided background noise when the guests on higher floors used their facilities, and the fact that my room was very hot with no way to control the temp - I was fine with it all. I had much work to get done and needed a place to crash that was livable. However, I knew that these rooms were discounted and wanted to see what other rooms might look like so the management was kind enough (especially since I told them I was going to review the hotel) to show me other rooms on the main floor. It was like night and day. We were obviously put in the \"low rent\" units in the lower floors while the main floor and upper floor had the most elegant, well appointed and above all spacious rooms. The Loft hotel is a work in progress. To be fair to the developers, it is innovative in its approach, edgy in its styling but suited for the younger or more adventurous traveler. If you are most comfortable in the traditional hotel setting, this is probably not your hotel. However if you have experienced timeshares around the world this would be more equivalent to the experience you might get. They are building out the units and the systems while renting to guests. The traditional tourist may have difficulty when they realize there is no ironing board, in room phones or central lobby. But I would stay here again and would advise the managers, developers, owners to provde ALL guests with a tour of the hotel - which is impressive. Since we booked and stayed in the \"cheap seats\" my review would have been much different if I had not seen the other sections of the hotel. The location is great for the young tourist as St Denis is filled with pubs, restaurants and young people exhibiting their broad diversity of expression. Overall if you are between 25 - 40, with enough money to pay their rates, without the expectations of the uniformity of Hampton Inn or the posh luxury of a Four Seasons this is worth a look. But if you are a traveler expecting to find everything you might find in a more traditional hotel and ready to compalin about what is missing - you will have many things to complain about. This is a quirky place. I encourage the management of this hotel to contiune with the work they are doing and would look forward to being invited back - this time to stay in the more lavish units so that I can provide my Trip Advisor travelers with a review of that (\"higher end\" experience as well. The ballroom is amazing and I could see a wedding couple taking over the hotel and using the massive rooms for guests and the lavish suites for their honeymoon stay. FOr those aunts and uncles and other relatives that you had to invite but don't really care for - book the lower floors and relegate them to those adequate and functional rooms. Overall - Innovative, edgy, very different, definately not for everyone - many would hate it and many would love it. I would stay again and hope to review again when its is completed next year.", "Date": "April 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGorgeous hotel & accomodating staff!

The hotel was close to everything - literally only 5 minute drives to everywhere we wanted to go (clubs, restaraunts, shoppings, etc). The staff was also amazing - they all spoke English very well, were very bubbly, and wanted to ensure we had the best stay possible.

I don't even know where to begin. From the moment I walked into the hotel, the staff treated me and my cousin with disrespect. Someone from the staff came down to our room almost every hour for no reason. We felt like we were in a dorm and we were being babysat. We repeatedly offered to leave the hotel if we were causing any sort of problem but they insisted that we stayed. We were NOT being loud, we abided by their rules, and there were absolutely NO complaints about our room (we asked if anyone had complained about us and they claimed that no one had). There were hotel rooms upstairs that had a minimum of 40 people present and they suffered NO fine and NO harassment. We were singled out the second we walked into this hotel. We were cooperative with the contract that we had to sign. Funny thing, the hotel was not cooperative with the contract that they had provided. While my cousin and I were out on the town, the hotel accepted $100 and LET PEOPLE INTO OUR ROOM, causing them to fine me $200 the next morning (which was NOT in the contract). They claimed that it was a cancellation fee but the cancellation fee is $200. They accepted $100 and allowed people into our room behind our backs. There was supposed to be a $30 fee for every extra person who slept in the room (no one slept in our room). As we were checking out, the lady at the front desk claimed that the $200 charge was for some fire extinguisher incident that happened in our hallway WHILE MY COUSIN AND I WERE OUT. Because it happened in the hallway that my room was located in, they decided that they should throw that charge onto my bill. I made the mistake of paying them (they only let me pay them in cash.. which I thought was very sketchy). Different people at the hotel have told me that the $200 charge is for different things. One claimed it was for extra people in the room (we had no more than 10 people in our room), and one claimed that it was for some fire extinguisher incident. No one at that hotel can seem to get their story straight. That's when I knew that they had been scamming me for my money. I spent almost $700 on a $250 hotel room because of their hassles. I spent a week, after my stay, trying to deal with this hotel. The woman that we spoke to on the phone was extremely rude, condescending, and even racist. She made a comment saying along the lines of \"we don't like those kind of people in our hotel\" (referring to a few of my friends). Also, the manager threatened us when we requested to speak with him. I've never EVER been so disrespected by a company before. I didn't even know that service (especially at a hotel) could ever be this horrible. I've called my credit card company to contest the charges put onto my card and I've called Canada's consumer protection. I'm almost to the point where I am going to get my lawyer involved.

I'm not sure what to make of this place. Its' not really a hotel at all (at least where we stayed for four of our five nights there, which turned out to be an apartment down the street from the actual \"hotel\" address). it turns out that we were given a sort of studio apartment which was quite a ways away from the hotel lobby. This sort of odd set up was kind of ok for us since we were there for a combination of business / leisure and were able to be pretty flexible but if I was travelling for business and planned on having certain amenities that you usually need or expect when on the road for work, I would have been sorely disappointed. Like I said, we were put in a sort of studio unit quite a ways down the street from the rest of the \"hotel\" and the lobby. The hotel address is Terrasse St. Denis, which if you google it, is an offshoot of the very busy and very loud Rue St Denis. Our room (studio apartment) was right ON St. Denis, across the street from a very loud club and our bed was directly in front of the window on the street. i would never want to stay here if I needed to sleep with the windows open. But honestly, the noise factor is sort of the least of the problems if you get this unit. There was a full kitchen, as in it had appliances, and was in a separate space of the apartment, but it was not outfitted with many of the necessities. There was a coffee maker, but no complimentary coffee or even coffee filters. There were empty salt and pepper shakers. There were wine glasses but no water glasses. There was a dishwasher but no dishwashing liquid or sponge or dish soap. There was a beautiful dining room table and some cheap dishes, but no napkins or even paper towels. So picture having to use toilet paper for dinner napkins. we did finally get hand soap on the second day after requesting it. There was no garbage can in our bathroom. There was no iron or ironing board and no hair dryer and there was no in-room phone so if you need to call the front desk, you need to use your own cell phone (expensive if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not from the area). There was an ipod player and clock but the ipod player sounded tinny and cheap and the clock feature was actually broken. The back window didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t close and wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fixed for three days (brrrr!). AND \u00e2\u20ac\u201c my husband went out back one morning and found a junkie on the fire escape, along with a slew of syringes scattered around. This is not the best area of town and being that you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any protection or insulation in the form of a lobby, you could quite possibly find some rather unsavory characters not only in the general area but right outside your back door. Not cool. There was also an alley directly across the street from the front door of our apartment which had obvious drug-dealing activities. if you do plan to stay here, plan on having to go to the store and spend quite a bit of $ on the basic necessities that you would need to stay in a place like this: paper towels, salt and pepper, bottled water, napkins, coffee, coffee filters, etc. The room looked nice and it had large, heavy furnishings that looked expensive, but someone just overlooked alot of details other than decorating. if you look close, there's even some oddities there; an antique-looking chair that's about to fall apart, a bedside table that leans at a very precarious angle, a dresser that is propped up on one side by scraps of wood blocks. For real. it' ON Rue St,, Denis, so if you want to be in the middle of the nightlife, this could be a great place to stay but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the best area and I would never want to stay here with kids. If you prefer something quieter, this is defintiely not the place for you. To be fair, after the incident with the junkie on our fire escape, they moved us to a room inside the hotel and it was spacious and lovely and the kitchen WAS outfitted with the things you would need: water glasses, a cutting board, paper towels\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.. but still no complimentary coffee supplies or salt and pepper. And there was a hair dryer there. But I guess you take your chances with whether you get a room in the actual hotel which is insulated from the street by a lobby and is much safer or whether you get \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an upgraded apartment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (ha!) that is actually an isolated apartment right on the street.", "Date": "October 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Middlesbrough, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cthe loft hotel montreal\u201d", "Author": "turbo34", "ReviewID": "UR81321801", "Content": "the hotel was not ready it was a complete mess the room was good and the hotel when finnished will be lovley there was no fire procedure in the rooms there was no iron no towels had to get them from reception no phone no complimentry tea or cofee had to sit in reception to eat brekfast or take to room booked a room with a bath and got a shower under the bed was filthy no idea of clenliness the lift was a death trap used the stairs even though had very heavy case braught the manager to the room and he agreed with us and gave us 50% off the stay would advise people to get in touch with him because 400 pounds for 3 nights is a rip off at a half finnished car park", "Date": "September 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vienna, Austria", "Title": "\u201cHotel with potential, problems with cleanliness and details ...\u201d", "Author": "eclipticon", "ReviewID": "UR79383408", "Content": "Instead of a room in the Loft Hotel itself, we were assigned to a room directly on Rue St. Denis, an upgrade as we were told.
