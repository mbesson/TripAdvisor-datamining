{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Decent, average hotel My friend and I stayed here during the Berlin Marathon last year when many of the hotels were booked or over priced. It was a decent, clean, inexpensive hotel. The breakfast was average, not impressive but not disgusting. The bed wasn't very sturdy but the room was definitely acceptable and saved us some money.", "Date": "Oct 20, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR343952762", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "drefoshizzle"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d529513-r10178840-Eckstein_Hotel-Berlin.html", "HotelID": "529513", "Price": "$105"}}
