The service was great. Fabrizio, the owner, was so kind and drove us each morning to the train station for our daily excursion to the city. He also set us up with private transportation to Campino airport. The rooms are very clean and they appear to be very new. We had a large balcony as well. The breakfast was standard euro-style complementary breakfast, except they keep the cappacinos and espressos coming at you which are delicious. The only problem we had was that we were trying to find the hotel on our own from the city the first night and we did not know how to get there. Be sure to go to the hotel website (hotelcastle.it) and print the directions. If you do not wish to do so, here are the directions for the lazy man - take subway(metro) to Flaminio station on the A line. Exit the metro station and walk next door to the Flaminio train station. Take the train north to Saxa Rubra Station. Outside the train station look for a yellow bus stop at the curb. Take bus 334 or bus 302 to Castle Gublio (spelling might be a little off). From this bus stop the hotel is about 100 yards away. It is about a 30 min or so trip back and forth from the city. We thought it was worth it as the hotels downtown are much more expensive. Overall it was a great hotel and we would definately stay here again!", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Genova, Italia", "Title": "\u201cOttimo rapporto prezzo/qualit\u00e0\u201d", "Author": "PaoloP66", "ReviewID": "UR115696755", "Content": "Found on Tripadvisor 2 days before the business trip, Castle Hotel was ony 3 min from my customer, but it was a real surprise to find such a good hotel in such part of Rome. Very good and modern accomodation, with swimming pool. Very close to the GRA, but quiet at the same time. Only cons: wifi does not work in the rooms, and breakfast nothing more than standard", "Date": "July 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cBest birthday ever\u201d", "Author": "cmarjuli", "ReviewID": "UR37423047", "Content": "My husband gave a trip to Rome as a b-day present...We stayed at Hotel Castle and we loved it. The rooms are clean and everything is new inside, we had a nice balcony. The staff is very friendly and owners usually are in the front desk to help you and take care of you. The hotel is conveniently located on the ring road of Rome and major motorway. If you are not driving the train and bus are also very near. The breakfast is the same everyday but we liked the Italian breakfast style, pastry, bread, nutella, juice and cappuccino or espresso. We truly recommend this hotel. We had the best trip ever..Thanks hun..", "Date": "August 11, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Castle", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d1059872-Reviews-Hotel_Castle-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$66 - $112*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Salita di Castel Giubileo 196</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Uscita Castel Giubileo del GRA</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00138</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1059872", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/43/b3/d9/reception.jpg"}}
