The hotel is situated the Taksim/Beyoglu area so there is vibrant nightlife all around, while the hotel itself was on a very quiet street. We enjoyed the location because, unlike Sultanahmet, it was filled with locals and not simply a tourist area. The rooms were very comfortable, the staff accommodating, the breakfast buffet was outstanding. The hotel also has a small pool/hottub and sauna, which were a welcome respite at the end of each day. Obviously, Miapera is not a large chain hotel which are certainly plentiful in Istanbul, but this was an excellent value in comparison.

It Is in a small street a block BEHIND THE GREAT & BUSY WALKROAD OF ISTINKLAL (10 walk to TAKSIM SQR). Most of the rooms are quite small but comfortable and have nice bathrooms with large Duch. Duble bed is small and wardrobe is quite small. Breakfast can be good (BASIC). Hotel's areas are clean and the staff are polite. We must emphasize that the neighbor where the hotel is situated is full of bars and clubs. Our room was at the frontafe side and there was excessive noise on Friday and Saturday night until early morning hours. We mean the noise of the music & drunk people OUT OF THE BAR. So it is best to book a room resembling backyard IN (FOR THE BRITISH COUNCULATE). DO NOT MISS the city map or a guide of Istanbul as most of the taxi drivers do not know all the small hotels (AS Miapera) and can be found in a circular driving trip!

Its rooms are nicely modern, spacious, clean, and surprisingly quite. The breakfast buffet offers a broad variety of Turkish and international food and is quite tasty. We found this hotel a very good choice because the more traditional parts of Istanbul with the well-known sightseeing spots can be easily reached by public transport or are even within walking distance (e.g., Galata tower (about 15 minutes walk)), while the nicer restaurants and bars are in Beyoglu so that you have a wide variety of choices for evening dinner within walking distance from the hotel. You can also easily walk from the hotel to cross Galata bridge to Sultanahmed (e.g., to visit the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Topkapi Palace). This is naturally a somewhat more lengthy walk but is easily manageable unless you have a walking disability in which case you can use public transport. We would always recommend to stay in the more \"European\" influenced Beyoglu and to visit the historical sites from there. Beyoglu admittedly does not feel and look too \"oriental\" but is rather comparable to cities like Barcelona, Madrid, and the like. However, in particular female travellers will feel more welcome there than in some other parts of the city where a more conservative populace (in particular males) sometimes finds its alright to make inappropriate and even aggressive remarks even if you are completely decently dressed and not behaving offensively in any way (But: You still need not be afraid in these parts and we never experienced any violence, however, one still feels somewhat uncomfortable in the very conservative parts of the city and would not wish to be confronted with behavior reflecting a somewhat backward idea of a woman's \"appropriate\" position in society when seeking to have a pleasant dinner somewhere (including, perhaps, with alcoholic beverages). In addition, the nicer restaurants, bars, winebars etc. will be found in the modern parts of Istanbul where two women walking around and dining alone will not encounter any problems or peculiar remarks/stares etc.; here, Istanbul is truly a very modern and pleasant European city!). All in all, Miapera hotel is an ideal choice for a visit to Istanbul and good value for money. The only (slight) critical remark concerns the English language abilities of the reception personnel. They do speak and understand some English and a visitor will ultimately be able to communicate with them, however, some brush-up language courses would do no harm and would alleviate communication in case of more complex requests. The rooftop bar seems to be open only in fair weather conditions (probably only in summer) and you should inquire before booking in case that is important for you (we did not try the spa area). They have a small conference room and business area, however, the publicly accessible computer is very slow and the printer did not work when we visited (so bring your own computer(iPad if you need a reliable connection).", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cmodern & clean\u201d", "Author": "c_djLondon", "ReviewID": "UR126294455", "Content": "its a nice modern little boutique hotel situated bang in the heart of beyoglu. the down side is the small double, which was uncomfortable to share with a friend. he spa (swimming pool & jacuzzi)w were not open for the whole duration of 3 nights we stayed there. lots of miss communication and understanding with the staffs. breakfast buffet was ok, not much choice in terms of fruit (they only serve oranges).", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vienna, Austria", "Title": "\u201cIt's all about the location...\u201d", "Author": "CavemanRacer", "ReviewID": "UR125785259", "Content": "I stay here regularly on business.

Advice: look at your room and if it doesn't have a desk, ask for one that does. Pros: great location, great breakfast buffet, chic decor/design, excellent showers. The pool was ok, but the sauna looked great, regret not using it. With most of the complaints below, the staff was usually pretty good about working out a fix when possible. Cons: We had to change rooms after 2 nights because we had no internet signal and then our phone line died in the first room. In our second room, there was a periodic faint smell of sewage that came from the bathroom sink. It was faint enough that we didn't complain, but, still kinda gross. DO NOT STAY IN 309! It had no desk and a deeply retarded floor plan. Also, be sure to specify to the desk that you do not want any cleaning agent/deoderizer sprayed on your bed/linens. They sprayed something on our blankets that smelled utterly repulsive. Some kind of cheap, awful air-freshener-type thing. Really brutal on the nose, totally disgusting. In both rooms the mattresses were crap. I'm not a whiner, but the mattresses may have been the worst I've dealt with in a respectable hotel. We were able to sleep but woke up feeling stiff, and we did not sleep well. Also, in the new room the hair-dryer below the sink had been sitting in a puddle of water that had pooled from a leaky pipe, probably. Not acceptable for a 4-star hotel. Maid forgot to bring toilet paper one night so we had to ask for it, and because of language issues they brought us water instead of toilet paper, which was actually kind of funny. Both rooms had a total of 4 hangers in the closet. We asked for more and they brought them. Then again \u00c2\u00a3345 total for 7 nights in a hotel including a tasty, free breakfast seems like a pretty good deal. The staff means well but should not be relied on for tourist info.

Large sauna and pool worth a visit to wind down after walking all day- you will need your towel from your room. The roof top terrace was closed but a member of staff opened it for me to let me take photographs of the city- well worth asking for. Location is good - just off the main shopping street - be warned don't expect to walk in straight line in this street. There are literally thousands of people walking here all day and all night till early hours. One tip- when heading out , turn left outside hotel and continue on through side walkway, don't turn right to go to the main shopping street. There is a lovely row of traditional stalls/ shops here selling a variety of food. There is another row of shops running parallel in an old indoor building selling antiques etc Lovely change from the high street stores.

There was plenty of room and the had nice complimentary amenities. The design of the bathroom was amazing and everything was comfortably modern.

We had a corner room and the WIFI service was unacceptable. My Sister had a central room on the same floor where the service was perfect. While the location is good in terms of restuarants, shops , nightlife and its proximity to Istiklal Street, It is located in a narrow back street and in 5 days we struggled to find a taxi driver that knew the hotel or the street \"Mesrutiyet Caddesi\" which coupled with their limited knowledge of english and ours of turkish made for some interesting taxi rides.", "Date": "October 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat location - Newer Hotel\u201d", "Author": "HHI_Mike", "ReviewID": "UR82197919", "Content": "We booked this hotel because of its location and were pleasantly surprised at how centrally located it is to shopping/dining/etc. It is one block from Itiskal Caddesi (almost the midpoint of this lively street!) and within minutes you are in the center of cosmopolitan Istanbul. The hotel rooms are small, but well appointed. The highlight is the bathroom, especially the shower -- whose rainhead produces more pressure than a car wash. The overall ambiance of the hotel is great and the service is decent. I do agree with other reviewers that the staff really does not go out of its way to make you feel at home, but when you interact with them they are friendly (reactive service vs. proactive service).

The shower was a treat, and the beds comfortable. Only a few rooms per floor, so it was pretty quiet. The breakfast buffet is great, with a good selection of hot and cold food. The staff were relatively friendly, but didn't seem to feel the need to go out of their way to make you feel at home. With a lot of large groups, and possibly business travellers, it wasn't the kind of hotel where you could easily meet people, but that said, it wasn't unfriendly. I didn't spend any time at the hotel restaurant/bar. Spa services are available but they seemed overly pricy to me. The pool and sauna was nice, despite the ridiculously small change/shower area (would be better to change in your room).

Arrived at the hotel, quite small reception area but very nice and modern. Our room was not ready so we just waited but they didnt take long. We were given a room which was up a couple of floors but had french doors into a small decked garden, which was a bonus. Room was small but very clean, modern and nicely decorated. My only gripe is the air con- it is not the best but we managed and the location and hotel makes up for this. The breakfast is chaos, small dining area and the fact that staff are slow at clearing tables can cause some problems, but this is something the hotel is probably sort out soon, as the hotel is open longer. The hotel is a 2min walk to the main street in the taksim area. Very busy- like princes street in edinburgh or las ramblas in barcelona, plently of shops, restaurants and bars. Even at night this street is packed, it is a fantastic atmosphere. The hotel is also 2 min walk from the stalls and streets of bars and pubs, there was a great atmosphere, each pub was packed and people sitting outside. This hotel has been in the best location, for any hotel i have stayed in. My boyfriend and i often find when visiting cities that we often end up in a area where there is nothing to at night but this place is fantastic- honestly STAY HERE! Roof top bar is lovely too, very calming and relaxing after a night out in the hussle and bussle of istanbul!", "Date": "October 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cDeceiving and insulting staff and ridicolous hotel policy\u201d", "Author": "wensmeeuw", "ReviewID": "UR81295399", "Content": "With a group of 8 people we booked 4 rooms in the Miapera hotel to enjoy a long weekend in Istanbul. When we arrived, the staff told us that we had to move to another hotel because of water problems in our rooms. We had no alternative because this weekend in Istanbul every hotel in this area was fully booked, and rates for similar hotels were in the range of 500-1000 euro a room. We got very suspicious because we had already read the bad review by AscherDubai on Aug 16 2010 with a similar story. We booked the hotel very early for a rate of 129 euro a room, so we had the feeling that our 4 rooms were possibly given to other travelers for a much higher rate. Before moving, we told them we first would like to see the rooms with water problems. They showed us just one small room with some fake tools on the floor, a folded carpet and some plastic on the bed. Because everything was clean and dry, and there were no signs of water problems anywhere, we asked them to show our other 3 rooms. They told us they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t show us these rooms, and gave the ridiculous reason that they were not allowed by their Technical Manager. We asked for this Technical Manager, but he was (of course) not around for that day. Although we persisted to just open the doors of the other 3 rooms, they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to do this. For us, the only thing we could do at that moment was to go to the other hotel they had arranged. This hotel, the Taslik hotel, was a very cheap hotel located in Besiktas. This meant we slept badly in very hot rooms, and we had to take a lot of long taxi-rides through all the traffic jams of Istanbul to arrive at our already booked restaurants and tours in the neighbourhood of the Miapera. The next morning, we took a taxi again from the Taslik to the Miapera, and they told us the could show us other rooms with water problems. These rooms look similarly ridiculous as the first one, with some random tools on the floor, a folded carped, and a opened A/C, an no signs of water or damp anywere. A fake situation you could arrange in 5 minutes in every random room, so it was clear these were arranged rooms of people already checked out in the morning. Of course we asked for a discount, because of the huge downgrade where received in moving to the Taslik hotel instead of the Miapera hotel. The gave us a discount of just 10% of the price, although the rate of the Taslik hotel is more than 30% lower than the Miapera hotel. This made us angry, but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t surpise us: it was completely in consensus with our experience with the Miapera.", "Date": "September 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Stay in brilliant location - just a few little bits to iron out\u201d", "Author": "Oz2_10", "ReviewID": "UR79939116", "Content": "Would definitely recommend this hotel although before booking we thought it was exorbitantly expensive, although the location is so perfect and the hotel was really lovely so we didn't regret it. We did stay over the weekend that ramadan finished so I imagine it was more expensive beacuse of this and there was also a raging party on the rooftop for these nights although thankfully that stopped for the rest of our week stay. The room was great and the spa downstairs was excellent - had a beautiful massage then they presented me with a cake for my birthday which was an appreciated extra touch. The hotel is literally two minutes from Istikal Caddesi - the main street of Beyoglu and it was a brilliant spot to stroll anytime of day or night to take in the culture of Istanbul. Beyoglu was a great area to stay in as we were not surrounded by tourists but swarms of all types of people and within easy walking distance to great restaurants and pubs. I was relieved we weren't staying in Sultanhemet after being there sightseeing it was nice to escape somewhere with a more lively vibe. Room service was amazing - I have never written that sentence before but truly the food at the hotel including breakfast was faultless. I encourage you to eat there! There a few little things that could be improved. Most of the staff were great, most especially Yo-kan and Firat, but there were one or two breakfast staff that were a little surly - maybe because they could do with putting one or two more staff on during breakfast. Also we had a couple of issues with our room key there and if you had the right person things were dealt with very smoothly but if not, problems were left unsolved. Yo-kan was so kind he even accompanied us to the post office to ensure we could safely post home some grand bazaar purchases.

Having heard that Beyoglu was a great place for eating and shopping, we thought we'd look for somewhere central in this area. The Mia Pera and the area didn't disappoint. The hotel is located less than a minute's walk to Istiklal Caddesi, the centre of eating, drinking and shopping in Istanbul. It is also about 10 minutes walk to Taksim Square, a central area for public transportation (it is a 20 minute or so ride to the main attractions in Sultanahmet). You can also take a tram down the centre of Istiklal Caddesi, which is convenient when you buy too many clothes or fill up on too many sweets! Even better than Istiklal is the myriad little bars and restaurants in the back streets of Beyoglu, which are open well into the night, especially on the weekend, so it is easy to grab a drink or something to eat at any time of day or night. Despite this, the hotel itself is very quiet (or so we thought) and we had no difficulties sleeping. The rooms are lovely - the bed was so comfortable - and have great air conditioning. The staff are really sweet and helpful, and were considerate enough to let us check in very early after my partner had gotten off a long flight.
