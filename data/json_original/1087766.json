Yes, it was that great. Less than a week ago, we walked out on the massive porch and were greeted with the most spectacular view of Bosphorus. This is probably the most historic waterway in the world. History and culture were passing before us and we could touch the water. One morning I relaxed in the warm whirlpool and watched the Bosphorus wake up. On the final morning before we had to catch our flight, we delighted in the brunch and enjoyed the glimmering Bosphorus and, along with the dolphins, watched ferries, water taxis, shipping vessels, tour boats, naval craft, and the water craft of the rich and famous. We bought a Turkish tapestry in the carpet museum in the Hotel. No pressure, just great service. The room, staff and amenities were five star as one would expect with rates listed with three zeros instead of two. This trip actually fell out of the sky for my wife and I, just like we had rubbed the Aladdin's lamp. Sometimes life treats you better than you could ever imagine. Lest I forget, we had instant access to one of the most magical cities in the world. One tip, we took the water taxi from the Four Seasons Bosporus to the Four Seasons Sultanhmet in the old city. This is where it is at, the crossroads of 3,000 years of history, culture and religion. The water taxi avoided all the cabs and traffic.It was the tulip festival in Istanbul. The picture is the park pretty much across the street from the Four Seasons Bosporus. I don't know, did I just wake up from a dream?", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vienna, Austria", "Title": "\u201cexpansive, but really an outstanding place\u201d", "Author": "theoneandonlyArnold", "ReviewID": "UR128345333", "Content": "brilliant setting, perfect service, perfect quality of rooms and all hotel facilities. terrace at bosphorus is brilliant. and all this has its price...", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york", "Title": "\u201cIf you can afford it\u201d", "Author": "aussieNewYork", "ReviewID": "UR128251045", "Content": "We shifted from the ritz to the four seasons and it took a little adjustment. It is a more formal environment which can be less relaxing. Rooms were normal standard and the location was superb on the bosphorous. The things we loved were the spa which was brilliant and the pool was levels above the ritz. Breakfast buffet was excellent , expensive of course, but we had dinner at he aqua and treated my son to some ribs (36 usd) and they were disappointing. We went down the road to ortakoy via taxi, the next night to the \"House cafe\" near the jazz club (where hilary kole was playing) and enjoyed dinner there. We took the ferry to the old city via the ferry system to asia and back which was great but the concierge gave us some bad advice to get to Minaturk on ferry. Guess not many four season guests use the ferry system. In the end, it was a memorable stay. Taxis seem to have easier access to the hotel than the ritz which is actually quite important for the quality of the service. It was a palace and still is in my view.

The hotel itself is a beautiful old building with modern wings. The rooms are spacious and well laid out. Staff and friendly and service in general is excellent. The food was good, although the choice of restaurants within the hotel is limited to a bar menu, a Mediterranean restaurant or room service. Other than the Bosphorus front, the location is ok but there are better places to be from a tourist perspective if you want to be near the big attractions. Given the traffic it can take a while to get around, but in a city the size of Istanbul it isn't possible to have a location that is convenient for everything. A good choice for business or couples.

We had stayed at the Four Seasons Sultanahmet at the beginning of our visit to Turkey. We preferred the Sultanahmet hotel. The service here at the Bosphorus location was superb. As you would expect from Four Seasons. The hotel is beautiful. The out door area is expansive & covered in marble. Very beautiful right on the water. It was not warm enough to sit outside but on a nice day, it would be a great place to sit & have lunch out enjoy a cocktail. The outdoor pool is also lovely but was not being maintained when we were there. It was dirty & needed cleaning before the season starts. Out room was quite large. We had our 21 year old daughter with us & decided on our last night we would opt for just 1 room. We were upgraded to a garden view room - but if they consider the room we had \"garden view\" then I am glad we didn't pay extra for it. We overlooked the entrance to the hotel. It does have a \"garden\" area in front of the hotel but what really catches your eye is all the cars pulling in & the traffic on the street. It is on a very busy street. But the room itself was nice. We had a roll away bed in the room & we still had plenty of room to move around. There was a desk & chair and a sitting chair with still plenty of room, so a very large room. There is a window seat also which was a nice feature. The room did seem a little dated or just in need of some better decor. It was plain.

I must admit, I had some initial second thoughts about choosing the Four Seasons when I saw the proximity of other hotels such as the Hilton and Intercontinental to the Convention Centre which would have made going to the conference each day more convenient. However, the experience of staying at the Four Seasons more than compensated for the short distance travelled to the conference daily. This hotel sets a standard that would be the envy of most luxury hotels. As you know, the location is simply stunning, even in winter, with intimate Bosphorus views. The level of service was outstanding: all the staff knew my name, even the ones I hadn't met! I would like to comment on two things in particular: The spa, sauna, relaxation rooms, gym facilites were incredible. Most commercial gymnasiums would not compare to the quality of the equipment provided. Secondly, the manager on duty approached us as we leaving to ask for feedback about our stay. I do not think this was paying lip service, but rather a genuine enquiry about our experience at the hotel, and a desire on their part to know how they can continue to fine tune their product.

On the one hand, it is a spectacular hotel with amazing rooms, great service and unparalleled views. On the other hand, we had a couple issues with the hotel that were grievous, which we will explain. First, the high points. The hotel provided us (at cost) with a pick-up from and back to the Istanbul Airport. This service is superb \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the assistant was waiting for us when we got through customs holding a sign up with our name. They took our bags and loaded them up in the vehicle, which was conveniently parked right near the door of the airport. The vehicle was a very nice Mercedes and there were refreshments waiting for us, including chilled water. This was a private transfer, so the guide told us about Istanbul as we drove (the drive from the airport to the hotel can take up to an hour, depending on traffic). The private transfer is a great option, but it is very expensive. Honestly, we recommend just getting a taxi. The taxis are plentiful, easy to use and are a fraction of the cost of a private transfer. Once at the hotel, the porters whisked our luggage away to our suite and we were checked in quickly. We had a rooftop suite and, if you can afford it, we highly recommend it. The room was amazing. It was a studio suite, but very large. The main living room portion was equipped with a beautiful couch and chairs with a central coffee table that became our main area for spreading out maps and books and going over photos. The room included an espresso maker, beautifully designed closets, copious mirrors throughout the suite and many other amenities. The bathroom was a giant marble tiled cavern with a spectacular rain-head shower and large soaking tub. As with all Four Seasons properties the provided toiletries and bathroom amenities were above average. The bedroom area was equally impressive with a beautiful king sized bed. Throughout the suite, the art work, design and decorations were commensurate with a 5-star hotel and very well done. Perhaps the most spectacular part of the suite, though, was the rooftop patio. The patio is accessed through sliding glass doors from the living room and includes chaise lounge chairs and a large open area \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is very private and is great for sunbathing in any state of undress or even hosting guests for drinks. But everything else is overshadowed by the incredible view of the Bosphorus from the patio. There are few vantage points that will give you equal views both up and down the straight. You can easily see the spectacular bridges to the North and the port to the South and everything in between. The sight will take your breath away during the day, but really comes alive at night when everything is lit up. The patio in the rooftop suite is worth staying at this hotel for at least a night. The hotel itself was equally very good. The breakfast (included in our suite price) was absolutely superb, which is a Four Season\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forte. Most Four Seasons hotels are known for their restaurants almost as much as their suites, and this hotel did not disappoint. We ate one lunch and all our breakfasts in the hotel restaurant and were not disappointed. The concierge service was world class and provided us with excellent recommendations and was very helpful in making reservations, and changing or cancelling reservations as our plans changed. For example, we had scheduled a private cruise on one of the evenings and found ourselves across the city with no way to make it to the boat in time. We were at serious risk of completely missing our cruise and still having to pay for it. We called the hotel concierge and told him our issue and he called the cruise company for us and arranged to have the cruise cancelled at no charge to us (even though the boat had already departed to come pick us up). Unfortunately, we did have some complaints about the hotel. First, our common complaint with luxury hotels \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no free internet service. It fairly boggles the mind that when you are paying well over a $1000 a night for a hotel room, that they still want to nickel and dime you for internet access. Unacceptable in this day and age. The location of the hotel can be an issue for some activities. In order to get the spectacular views of the Bosphorus, the hotel is situated fairly far North along the strait. This means that almost nothing in Istanbul is within walking distance of the hotel and, as you will learn quickly, traffic is horrible. Every time we travelled down to the Sulhmanet side of the city (Hagia Sofia, Blue Mosque, Grand Bazaar, etc.) it took up to an hour to fight our way through traffic in a taxi. Eventually, we learned how to use the tram system and that was much quicker (but not quick). Also, the tram does not run all the way to the hotel, so you are forced to either walk the rest of the way from the last tram stop (a good 15 min walk) or try to find a taxi, which turned out to not be that easy in that area. We also chose to book several spa appointments at the hotel, and although the treatments were good, they were not worth money. We had the couples hammam, where one of our therapists ran out of the mud and only covered part of our body instead of all of it, and we felt rushed after completing our experience instead of being able to relax before we needed to leave. There are many amazing places to get a massage and a traditional and/or luxury hammam in Istanbul instead of wasting your money at the Four Seasons spa. Finally, our biggest complaint is another one that, for us, seems to be common in Four Seasons hotels \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they tried to overcharge us. Normally, I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make a big deal about a minor billing error, but this was far from a minor error. They tried to overcharge us by about $2000. When I went to check out of the hotel, I was running a bit late and almost left without checking the final bill, but I decided to get a copy with a zero balance, and I am glad I did. When I saw the bottom line price, I almost fainted \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was way higher than it should have been. I pointed the price discrepancy out to the desk clerk and he, at first, balked and told me it was correct. Risking being late to the airport, I made him go through the charges line-by-line. The bottom line is that they had added charges for things we did not do/buy and overcharged us on the room costs by almost 50% in some cases. A manager came over and the bill was corrected, but this could have been much more difficult if I had left without checking the bill. Overall, this is a superb hotel. It is definitely a 5-star property, but the attempt to overcharge us on almost everything left a bad taste in our mouths. We recommend the hotel, but highly recommend you think about the location and definitely check your bill closely!", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cUnexpected thrill for a magic experience\u201d", "Author": "Murphles", "ReviewID": "UR120413373", "Content": "We touristed Istanbul for a week and deliberately changed neighborhoods and style...glad we did.

The grounds are very nicely done, and the setting on (and views to) the Bosphorus are fantastic- in some ways better than the Ciragan Palace up the street (latter looking a bit worn). The interior design of the bar area is very nicely done, combining hints of Turkish design with a transitional contemporary aesthetic that is neither modern, nor traditional. The breakfast on the terrace can't be beat for the views, and the buffet is very extensive (sadly though, no where near presented as nicely as the Ciragan Palace). All this said, this property is not perfect - which it really should be given its spectacular setting. Here are my gripes: 1./ The rooms: while very comfortable and done to a high standard, they are sadly bland, which is tragic in a city where there is so much to draw from by-way-of design aesthetic and beautiful things. The interior designer failed miserably on the rooms- he/she should have taken a walk and borrowed inspiration from the antique shops in Cukurcuma to the modern aesthetic of the Turkish designers at Derin and Autobahn to the many beautiful fabrics, ceramics, prints and metal work to be found beyond the tourist tack in the Grand Bazaar- many elements of which could have been artfully and tastefully integrated into Four Season's restrained approach to interiors (Four Seasons, to be fair, is not a boutique hotel chain). 2./ The horrible lounge music played on the terrace and outdoor areas- basically elevator music versions of Sade and Jobim in every permutation and combination of english, spanish, french and portuguese (same phenomena in many high-end establishment located across Emerging Market countries), catering, no doubt, to the prevalent crowd that seemed to be staying at the hotel- i.e. a too-much-money-but-too-little-taste combination of arriviste Americans, Russians and Gulf-Middle-Easterners. Memo to hotel management: Turkey has a rich music tradition- take some local pride and weave that into the repertoire. 3./ The swimming pool: crying out to be an infiniti pool, given its spectacular setting. Its ridiculous for such a comparatively new facility that one can't even see the bosphorus when in the pool, due to the surrounding lounge chairs. What could they have been thinking. 4./ Staff: while the staff was very Four Seasons professional and trained all the way, the front desk and concierge staff were oddly cold and detached for a country with such warm people- seems to be a typical phenomena in places that suffer from too much of the wrong kind of tourism, combined with a local economy where there are increasingly wealthy people. That said, the staff at the Four Seasons Mexico City still seem to retain their warmth, so its unclear why that same selection of staff doesn't apply in Istanbul. 5./ Internet- at nearly USD $700 per night, I just can't understand why they can't come up with a tourist package that includes internet charges, instead of charging an incremental 20 euros per day, which is really tasteless. Net-net, I would stay here again. Its a great hotel with still more potential to the extent that management chooses to seize upon the opportunity to make some refinements.", "Date": "August 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "garden city", "Title": "\u201cfabulous new hotel on the bosphorus\u201d", "Author": "tallulahsoq", "ReviewID": "UR116526648", "Content": "we just got back from 5 glorious days in istanbul, never had i imagined how captivating the city was - sexy, sensual, historic and modern, all at the same time. we have stayed in many four seasons, but this one is truly outstanding. in terms of location, it cant be beat! kinda in between the more hip and happening ortakoy/bebek areas, and the old sultanamet town across the bridge, plus the taksim/nisantasi shopping areas, the best thing about it is that it is literally on the water. as we were there in summer, the cool and constant breeze from the bosphorus helped cool us down, as we sipped on mint ice tea by the pool or at the bar. the rooms needless to say are big, very comfortable, and they provide really exotic fruits on the daily fruit platter, not just the quintessential apples and oranges - in fact there was none of that, but really sweet purple plums, plump juicy peaches, fresh apricots, tiny midget apples, and a variety of different grapes. these are the little touches that make this 4 seasons stand out from the rest. the service staff from the recep to the concierge to pool attendants, are awesome, always quick and willing to serve. the only thing is that they dont serve complimentary ice water by the pool, given that it's 33 degrees in the afternoon, people cant keep ordering juices, they need water. they charge around 6 euros for a small bottle of local mineral water, which you could get for free if you just stop by the gym. there is a dock for water taxi if you are so inclined to take it rather than sit in traffic, though they cost much more it is still a convenient way to travel across town. when in istanbul, do not miss the cruise on the bosphorus!! its the best way to see istanbul as many places need to be appreciated from the water. there are historic summer places built by the sultans, luxury villas on the asian side, tons of fish restaurants along the coast and all the beautiful bridges. there are different companies offering different cruises, but the best bet is to walk to the besistas ferry terminal 5 mins walk from the hotel, and hop on a local ferry. they are clean, comfy and cheap!! it was around 4 euros per person for a 1 hour sunset cruise by this company called dentur. ( they dont call it that, but since we took the 7pm boat, it was our sunset cruise). we watched the sun setting over the bosphorus, the sky lighting up in a myriad of colors, and the twinkling lights shimmering in the distance, it was truly the BEST 4 euros ever spent!! anyway, the hotel recommended their own 500 euros sunset cruise on the seasons private boat which probably would be a super amazing experience, but we were glad to have taken the local route and it was commendable that this alternative was actually suggested by the concierge halil, who is awesome with making all the restaurant reservations too. all in all, highly recommended hotel, and we will definitely be back!", "Date": "August 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "san diego", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Setting\u201d", "Author": "momof3ponies", "ReviewID": "UR116321790", "Content": "We loved the restaurant and pool.

The hotel is in a terrible location for visiting Istanbul's important sites. For that, there is probably no nicer hotel than the other Four SEasons in town, which is a treasure. The Four Seasons Bosphorous is probably best situated for business downtown. Rooms are small. Prices are high and unless you spring for the $2500 a night suites overlooking the Bozphorous you will probably be disappointed with the view. (Other reviewers have showed photographs of their rooms with supposed Booherous views.) Our room cost 620 euros per night and overlooked the hotel awning and car park. It was in the main, old palace section of the hotel so had wonderful nigh ceilings but the room itself was tiny. Two decent closets but no good place to set the suitcase. Servicd at the hotel is hit and miss. Some employees were attentive and helpful. Others were inept. There was complete chaos, for example, with our bags when we checked in. A reservation was made with the concierge for dinner in the hotel restaurant, Acqua. When we arrived at the restaurant, they had no record of our name. We eventually got a table. Wish we hadn't. The food at Acqua was by far the worst meal we had in Turkey. Embarrassing for a high end resort to have a kitchen turn out the slop we were served. The chef, we were told is Italian so we ordered risotto, which was sicky, leaden glop. The pasta was overcooked mush. The services at the spa were also a disappointment.

I told him I was feeling tired after a long flight so he made every effort to keep the formalities short and efficient. This is stark contrast to the 30-minute ordeal I endured at the Raffles earlier this week when I checked in. All the paperwork was done in my room, a shirt was taken to to be pressed, a car booked to go back to the airport and it all took about five minutes. Other examples of genuine service: I arrived early for a spa appointment and so I had a swim and a visit to the sauna. The attendant had said that he would come and get me when my treatment was going to start so I didn't have to take a watch or worry about the time - just relax. Afterwards, in the lounge I had some Turkish tea and the waiter saw that I ate the two cookies very quickly so he brought me four more, figuring rightly that I was very hungry. Everybody seemed genuinely friendly and, more important, actually paid attention to what I was doing and what I needed in the moment. The suite was awesome. Big comfortable bed, luxurious toiletries and nice touches like flowers and fruit. The bay windows had Ottomans in them so I could sit and watch the boats go by outside and stare at the Topkapi palace and mosques on the Golden Horn in the distance.

All staff are very professional, courteous, and helpful. They always greeted us by name, and are very responsive to our requests and always do their best to satisfy our needs. From the moment we arrived at the hotel, to the moment we left, we felt truly welcome and being looked after. (2) Location: While it's not located in the centre of action, the hotel provides a refreshing escape from the hustle and bustle of Istanbul. In fact, it's not too far away from the city centre either. Buses run from the Kabatas tram stop to Besiktas, and from there the hotel is just 5 mins walk away. So everything is nicely connected. Taxi to Taksim takes about 15 mins but can greatly depend on traffic condition. A walk in the hotel's garden by the Bosphorus and watching the ferries crossing is such an invigorating and revitalizing experience! Here, we watched the New Year's Eve fireworks shoot out from every corner of Istanbul - simply amazing! (3) Room: This is the only area that needs improvement. The furnishings in room appear to be a bit outdated and somehow discount the luxurious feeling exuded by other parts of the hotel. While we find the room elegant and classy, it's not sophisticated nor upmarket. Being a Four Seasons hotel, we would expect the room (especially the bathroom) to be more refined, with more exquisite interior design. The bathroom has separate bath and shower, but again, the fixtures are basic and lack of a luxurious feeling. There is a mini bar, but no tea/coffee making facilities. Having said that, the bed is soft and comfortable, and room is immaculate. We must have been given a partial ocean view room as we could see the Bosphorus and beautiful water feature in the garden. Rooms that face the hotel entrance and main road could be quite noisy. (4) Spa: Divine! Separate areas for men and women, each has a changing area/locker, sauna, steam room, showers, and a relaxation room. The indoor heated pool and whirl pool are simply magnificent. Cold towels and bottled water are provided throughout the spa centre, and the staff are incredibly friendly and hard-working - used towels are almost always taken away immediately! The whole area is very neat and well-maintained. Spa treatments are also excellent albeit expensive, and I highly recommend the traditional Turkish Hamam. For ladies, I would recommend female therapists. (5) Concierge: Incredibly knowledgeable and helpful. They helped us book several restaurants long before we arrived the hotel. No question is ever too much, and they all seem to be very well connected with local business. Super efficient and pleasant as well! (6) Others: The hotel has a business centre where guests can access the internet. Wireless internet available from room, but not free. Obviously, the hotel has its own contracted taxi drivers, so guests are ensured that the taxi drivers understand English and that they are charged by the meter.", "Date": "February 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "surrey", "Title": "\u201cFabulous hotel in a wonderful setting.\u201d", "Author": "mw104", "ReviewID": "UR94391338", "Content": "We booked this hotel for a long weekend break.

The weather was glorious. We enjoyed this side of the city much more than the historical side, because the property faces the water and this is the side where the locals are. The Bosphorus is simply wonderful and gorgeous. The scale is monumental, and the water serves all sorts of commercial activities. It is alive and full of energy. This hotel property takes full advantage of its location. The rooms are open, modern, and bright. The automated black-out screen (yes, operated with a switch) is a cool feature at both properties. Service is, as usual, top class. Love the breakfast buffet. Charming bay window offered a generous glimpse of the Bosphorus. The large plaza facing the water also offers a rare treat for Istanbul: smooth and level marble flooring! (Istanbul street paving is nothing but one giant tripping hazard). The ferry stations nearby (all within walking distance) provides easy access to the Bosphorus and the Asian side. A 15-minute walk northward took us to Ortakoy, a charming little port area favored by the locals and tourists alike. Dolmabahce Palace is a 15-minute walk southward. Taksim Square and Istanbul Modern are close by via taxi. There is a splendid fitness center equipped with state-of-the-art exercise equipment and includes a pilates studio complete with reformer and cadillac machine. The indoor mosiac pool is sublime with its underwater music system. The spa is huge and elegant. The husband enjoyed his hamman treatment, and I enjoyed my massage by a nice Balinese lady named \"Su\" (water in Turkish). On the downside, both Four Seasons property boast large televisions but the image and audio quality is nasty by US standards (HD TV anyone?). The main building is a former private palace that has been converted nicely. However, the annex buildings, although modern and plush on the inside, are not very attractive on the exterior. In fact I would venture to say the two white and brown annex buildings constitute a bit of an eye sore, especially compared to how attractive the rest of the place is. The large bed in our room (#3304) has sagged on both sides enough for me to notice during sleep. The circulation of the place is a bit awkard since the annex buildings are only connected on the ground floor. Especially if you are staying in the north annex building, and have to return to your room after using the Spa which is located in the basement of the south annex building. The husband, after his great hamman treatment, had to parade through the main lobby with a big towel rolled over his head (like a sultan!), and his robe and slippers. We asked for the hotel to arrange for an encore 4-hour private tour from Seda (who was our trusted guide a few days back and had galantly lead us on an 8-hour private tour when we were at the Sultanahmet side). Once again, Seda saved us a bunch of time because she knows where to go and essentially helped us free up another whole day. She is fun and easy going. Seda is more than a guide, she has become a good friend to us. Hooray!

I was blown away by every aspect of FS Bosphorus. Details below. Arrival: A phalanx of doormen and greeters greeted us by name and ushered us quickly into the hotel. Turndown service and housekeeping touches: Bottles of water, accompanied by drinking glasses covered with protective caps for cleanliness. Plate of small desserts each night. Housekeeping touches: Tasteful bookmarks stamped with the Golden Horn motif, inserted in the novels we were reading. Fruit basked refilled daily. Toiletries: Full-size Aqua di Parma. Restaurants: At Aqua, the servers and maitre d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 went out of their way to ensure that our meals were enjoyable, tailoring them to our preferences, introducing us to local specialties when they sensed our interest, and warmly greeting us by name each morning when we arrived for breakfast, which included an incredibly lavish buffet and made-to-order items. Service and quality of food for dinner and lunch was consistently high. Spa and Fitness Center: Spacious, high-ceilinged fitness center\u00e2\u20ac\u201done of the largest I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever seen in a resort or hotel. The spa itself is a superb space, with men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s areas on each side of a columned, tiled indoor pool. In each of the gendered areas, the d\u00c3\u00a9cor is subtly evocative of Turkish design, with lamps and candelabra creating a sense of place. Each side contains a waiting area, relaxation area, steam room, and sauna. Public Areas--Interior: Exquisite. As usual with FS, tremendous floral displays in the public areas, and subtle design elements that speak of Istanbul without ever devolving into kitsch\u00e2\u20ac\u201da fireplace in the lounge that echoes the shape of the fireplaces in the Topkapi harem, objet d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122art of museum quality, Turkish carpets, etc. Public Areas\u00e2\u20ac\u201dExterior: In a subtle reference to the marble terracing that abounds at Topkapi, FS has used the same white-and-gray marble to create a really superb outdoor space, with a fountain, benches, and red gardenias galore. To the left of the hotel is the outdoor dining area\u00e2\u20ac\u201dAqua restaurant and an outdoor lounge for more casual orders throughout the day. To the right is the pool. But straight in back of the hotel simply and perfectly an open terrace of marble, centered upon a fountain, so that the views from the hotel to the Bosphorus are unmarred. The pool area is very smart\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand the cabanas are free, first-come, first served. Turkish-themed music is piped underwater. Guest Rooms: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d steer clear of any of the rooms in the annexes, which lack the high ceilings of the palace building. See below for a glimpse of the unattractive annex buildings\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhich you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see on the website. I stayed in Palace Garden room--because I knew I wanted to be in the historic main building with its high-ceilinged rooms. My mistake was not to have splurged for a Bosphorus view in the palace building. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d assumed that I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spend enough time in my room to pay the premium for that view, but each time I walked by one of those rooms with the door propped open by housekeeping, the view out to the Bosphorus really did take my breath away. I have to say: I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth it. But so you can judge for yourself, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve posted the views from the rooms facing the front of the hotel, overlooking the entrance. Not an eyesore, but certainly not the Bosphorus, either. Regardless of view, I loved the room itself in the main building\u00e2\u20ac\u201dvery high ceilings, painted. Contemporary furnishings, in soothing taupe and pale blue. Arched ceiling in the bathroom. Rather than the typical Four Seasons pillows and bedding (white with a colored rectangular border), the bedding here, equally comfortable, was off-white with a subtle pattern. Service: Superb, across the board. Everyone knew our names; the concierge team delivered daily reminders, on evocative cards designed to replicate famous Ottoman tiles, of our reservations; noting from her passport that my girlfriend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s birthday has occurred in the past week, they delivered a surprise chocolate dessert to our room within an hour of our arrival. Summary: I was lured back to Istanbul entirely because of the praise that many of you and others have heaped upon this hotel/resort, and I must say that every bit of that praise was deserved\u00e2\u20ac\u201dstaying here was worth the cross-Atlantic trip all by itself, even if I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d never left the hotel to re-acquaint myself with Istanbul\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s charms (including, after 17 years, the removal of the scaffolding from the central dome in Hagia Sophia).

The concierge was wonderful having made several bookings from at home for us. A driver was waiting at the airport for us and promptly took over our luggage upon our identifying ourselves. A dinner reservation was made for us at the Sunset Grill, a restaurant I would highly recommend that overlooks the city with breathtaking views and wonderful food.

It was \"country club casual\" in attire and served a wonderful array of food selections including sushi.

We stayed in a Garden View Room, which was a bit disappointing compared to the views of the Bosphorus, but we didn't want to pay any more than we already were. The room itself however was fabulous, especially so with a window seat. The hotel sprawled right along the Bosphorus, so it felt amazing to sit and soak up the atmosphere of the passing boats and the sounds from all around. It's a magical place and we loved it. The weather was mostly good when we were there (with the exception of one or two rainy days) and we enjoyed breakfast at the outside restaurant. The service was seriously lacking at breakfast, with lots of inconsistencies. In fact, I felt like just a number: like they herded you to your seat and wanted to get rid of you ASAP, sometimes not offering coffee refils and giving you the cheque quite promptly. We like to take our time over breakfast, and we like to feel like special guests (especially for the money we paid) but it didn't happen. Our first day at breakfast we were told \"Welcome back\"! Well it is a busy hotel. The breakfast buffet itself was vast with lots of lovely foods to choose from. The service elsewhere in the hotel was excellent, but also with inconsistencies. Our first day at the pool, we were automatically given iced water, but the other days we went back to the pool this didn't happen. Some days the staff handed out iced drinks or fruit, but other days nothing. But the pool staff were very friendly and didn't seem to mind my pink rubber ring! The food at the poolside restaurant was excellent - for lunch we had margaritas and quesadillas (on two different days) and this was fantastic. We also came here for dinner and tried different meze foods with turkish bread, and my partner had the chicken shish, all excellent and with excellent and friendly service. The location of the hotel is both good and bad. On one hand, it is well placed a bit out of the city, with an excellent position on the Bosphorus quite near the Bosphorus Bridge. We were able to walk along to Ortakoy where there are a few cafes, restaurants and the Ortakoy Mosque. However, transport into the city centre wasn't quite as convenient. We had to walk quite far to a tram stop (Kabatas) to take us into Taksim Square. We took the commuter boat back as far as Besiktas and still had a bit of walking to do to get back to the hotel. But it's a small sacrafice to stay at such a grand hotel with a massive swimming pool, loads of space and amazing views. We had a fantastic holiday, with just the right mix of relaxation and sight-seeing. We would definitely return to this hotel. We saw Dame Shirley Bassey in the hotel bar on our last night!

In some respects it is in sharp contrast to the Four Seasons at Sultanahmet (see separate review), in some respects more of the same. Firstly, the similarities. The service is wonderful throughout the hotel My wife commented that all the staff, from the bell hop to the manager, do genuinely appear to care, rather than parroting the endless platitudes that you get in some establishments. Now I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure that they are just well trained, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really very pleasant to feel that they care anyway. The food was similarly excellent. The buffet breakfast recommended, if highly expensive. The style of the Bosphorus hotel is somewhat different to the converted prison at Sultanahmet. Having only opened relatively recently, and being based on an old palace, it should come as no surprise that it feels bright and shiny and new. Every thing is perfect - although we witnessed the flower pots being repainted on our second day - and the decor is considerably more contemporary than the Sultanahmet property. To be honest it felt somewhat colder and less welcoming on arrival, but after a day or so we had got used to the slightly glitzier feel, the oversized television, and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new money\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd look and feel, and relaxed into the whole Four Seasons experience. Our room was spacious, bathroom well equipped with bath, separate shower, and as much L\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Occitane toiletries as you can stuff in your bag. The hotel is better equipped than Sultanahmet, being larger and having bigger grounds. The outdoor pool is suitable warm despite the air temperature being only 15-20\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcC during our visit, and is large enough for swimming lengths. The gym is well equipped with TechnoGym kit, and was almost empty. The indoor pool is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exactly like we want at home\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd according to my wife, with dark tiles (rather than the ubiquitous bright blue) and a substantial adjoining spa. The location of the Bosphorus hotel is not as good as Sultanahmet. You are not really that close to anything albeit taxis in Istanbul are cheap and easy to use - although surprisingly many of the drivers do not (at least pretend not to) speak English. We dined at Topaz restaurant one night (which is highly recommended), and Feriye the next evening (wonderful location but I felt the food was a disappointment). There are also numerous trendy nightclubs further along the Bosphorus further out of Istanbul if that is your bag. In summary the Four Seasons Istanbul at the Bosphorus is a tasteful, stylish, swish, yet sympathetic renewal of an ancient Istanbul palace. The facilities are excellent. The location average, but with great views over the Bosphorus. The service remains peerless. EUR20 a day for WiFi is still outrageous - although again I tapped into someone else\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for free.

We called FS in desperation after one night in Istanbul, as the hotel we were in was too depressing. We went from dark and dingy to divine! Yes, it is a bit out of the way. Yes, it is expensive. Yes, it is also a bit too big. But what a gorgeous place! Opened about 18 months ago, it has an expansive and beautifully designed terrace running the full length of the hotel on the water line. After a full day of sightseeing and crowds, it was heaven to sit there in the late afternoon, seeing the sun set over the minarets in the distance, sipping a bloody mary and watching the busy water traffic on the Bosphorous. The staff is perfect. Everyone called us by name; the young and charismatic restaurant manager spent \u00c2\u00bd hour with us and a map, recommending sightseeing activities, restaurants and cafes. He knew almost more than the concierges! Really, I cannot rave about this hotel enough. You should know, however, that we are 5 star hotel people. There is a FS at the Sultanhamet, which was full when we originally booked. So I then booked the best suite at the Best Western President in the Sultanhamet area due to location, thinking it would be fine (have posted a review), but not for us. It calls itself 4 stars but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not even close and I was foolish to think a BW could be. The Four Seasons Sultanhamet is much more central than the Bosphoros FS. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also apparently much more of a boutique hotel (converted from an old prison). However, for us, escaping the Best Western and walking out onto that terrace (see my photos!), having a hammam (Turkish bath) in their fantastic spa together with my husband, having the indoor pool for our daughter\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6well, it was just perfect. The ONLY complaint is that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not possible to walk to any of the fabulous sites. But don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take a cab all the way into the Sultanhamet area, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be stuck in traffic for ages and get ripped off. Take a cab to the Enimou area (the port and new mosque), which is 5 minutes drive from the FS via a direct road, and there get on the tram to the Old City. There is only one tram line\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.up and down. You buy a token before you get on (you need it to enter the turnstile), it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about 1.50 Turkish lira per token and it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter how far you go \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one stop or 5 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the same price. This hotel made our stay in Istanbul a wonderful memory (sun shine helps, too!). We had the cheapest room, Garden View (bit of a fudge, it was a view of the driveway but that is nicely landscaped!). It was huge (because it was a corner room # 3207) with an excellent and very large bathroom: tub, separate shower (big enough for two people!) and separate toilet. Plenty of closet space and many drawers, huge flat screen TV, big comfortable bed, bottle of water placed by the bed each night during turn-down service. Coffee machine (free); each morning we asked for warm milk for our coffee and it came within minutes. They also did an amazing job shining my slightly scruffy boots overnight (free). Newspaper (free). Wifi is NOT free, and this is one of my beefs about good hotels. It seems the more you spend in a hotel, the more you pay for internet connection. However, there is a business centre with 3 computers where you can access the internet for free. Every time my daughter and I went down there, we had no trouble getting a computer each.

The location is good for some sights, especially Dolmabahce, the lovely Yildiz Park (almost across the street), Istanbul Modern, the boat terminal for the Princes' Islands, lively Besiktas (a few hundred meters from the hotel and a great place for an evening stroll). The hotel itself is on a busy stretch of Ciragan Street, with an ugly driveway leading to the entrance, and you feel disconnected from Istanbul life. The hotel caters to large groups and hosts many functions (there was a loud corporate party on the terrace one day), so it does not feel intimate at all. I had a Palace Garden room, but choosing the right room is difficult here. The original building has higher ceilings and more light but it does not really feel like an Ottoman palace (too much renovation), and the regular rooms are not very big and terribly expensive. Suites in the palace are great but I am not sure they are worth 3000 euro+ per night. The less expensive rooms with a \"garden view\" look out mostly to the busy driveway with the buses, taxis and limos. The new wings look too modern, the rooms have lower ceilings and smallish windows, and only a few suites have a view to the Bosphorus. On the positive side, the room had the very high standard of comfort that comes with FS, the bar was a great place to unwind in the evening with live music, and breakfast at Aqua was a superb buffet. Service was good but not exceptional and feeling a little corporate. The highlight of the hotel, besides the terrace overlooking the Bosphorus, was the spa area, one of the best I have seen in a city hotel (although I was not impressed by the treatment in the traditional hammam). My conclusion is that this is a great business hotel with very expensive rooms, but I would stay elsewhere on my next romantic stay in the city, either at Les Ottomans in chic Kurucesme (also horribly expensive) for a more authentic \"palace on the Bosphorus\" experience or in Beyoglu (see my review of Tomtom Suites, which I enjoyed more than the FS).", "Date": "November 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belgium", "Title": "\u201cAmong the best i have ever seen (and I've seen many)\u201d", "Author": "Dirk3061", "ReviewID": "UR48191212", "Content": "Superb location; not the usual big anonymus building but mor like a (large) boutique hotel.

I'm now going back to basics and looking for boutique hotels with charm and atmosphere. It's true the original part of this property is rather grand, though the majority of the bedrooms are in two annexes which have as much design integrity as a 1970's Holiday Inn. Our room, granted, was once of the cheaper ones on offer, however I don't think 500 Euros a night exactly a bargain. And again, it was so ordinary in design that it lacked charm and could have been anywhere on the planet. It further bugged me to learn that the hotel was virtually empty yet they couldn't have stuck us further away - and after having spent countless thousands of pounds at this chain over the years, I think they could have found something nicer for us - though of course, one must remember The Four Seasons is now a franchise just like McDonalds, so no longer does it have that intimate special feel, and no longer do they appear to look at your past record of staying with them - now, you're just a number. However, the main reason I don't want to stay at a Four Seasons hotel again is the beds. I absolutely loathe these bizarre mattresses that have step like layers to them, as well as mattress toppers, so the second you lay down you feel like you're drowning in a huge sponge that gives me back pain. Admittedly I prefer a firm hard mattress, and it seems the Four Seasons are unable to accommodate a guest that wants that type of bed. However, the 5 nights I stayed here were a nightmare sleep wise, so I was moody all day craving a quite area to sleep by the pool. And yes, before you ask, I did request all the unnecessary layers of the bed were removed - and eventually they were after a third or fourth attempt - however it didn't make much difference. Pluses - dinner served in the Aqua restaurant was very good - and the best food we ate in Istanbul. Breakfast is also very good if there are not too many guests around. Come the weekend when there's an influx of new arrivals everything went a bit pear-shaped. But there are some very good professional staff on duty. Maybe given time they'll get used to the weekend crowd that pours in. After one half-day of touring the sights we got back to the hotel for a late lunch around 3pm, we ordered a Club Sandwich - and 45 minutes later we discovered they'd lost our order and simply forgotten about us, even though our waiter had us within his vision at all times. At 4.30 we got something to eat. Sorry, this isn't acceptable in a proper 5* Four Seasons. On our last night, after an excellent dinner, in a virtually empty restaurant, we had to repeatedly ask for the bill, which finally arrived after I had to raise my voice just under 30 minutes later. We originally arrived on a Friday - and on Friday and Saturday evening after dinner it was really nice to sit outside with a bottle of wine and watch the river traffic pass by. And there's a great young waiter who will make sure you're warm by giving you a wrap, and position Propane heaters around you. But come Sunday all the outdoor furniture is removed, no heaters - nothing. Odd, no? Either you offer a service to your guests or you don't. Don't give one day, and take away the next! These may seem like petty gripes - but when you've not slept properly in a room that's costing you 500 Euros a night you expect everything else to run perfectly. One should also be aware - though it's no fault of the hotel - that getting anywhere from this property takes ages due to the ridiculous high volume of traffic that passes the entrance to the hotel. I'm not sure if I'll bother going back to Istanbul as I feel the whole trip was a waste of money - however, if I do venture back I will most definitely look for a small boutique property that makes me feel like I'm in Turkey - where I feel it's acceptable for there to be mishaps - and I'm not paying a fortune at the end of it. So, upon leaving, and being 4 grand out of pocket I couldn't wait to get back home and have a decent nights sleep.", "Date": "August 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cThe most romantic view in all of Europe\u201d", "Author": "sebnemnyc", "ReviewID": "UR35292199", "Content": "As soon as I stepped foot in the Four Seasons at the Bosphorus, I knew it would be a truly special stay.
