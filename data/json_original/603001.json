I was looking forward to the ocean view from the room and actually that was the only nice thing about it. Like some other reviewer posted the ocean view rooms are located on a second floor in a dark hallway. The AC wasnt working and had to wait for more than an hour (@ 9 pm tired and looking forward to go to sleep) for the multifunctional owner, waiter, bartender cooker etc to come and \"fixed it\", and at the end I couldnt sleep because it never worked and it was like being inside a sauna but according to him i just had to give it like 15 min to cool, well i gave it the entired night and never did. The TV had 1 channel working and the signal wasnt good so it kept disconnecting he sttd that will go and cheked and i saw him just ignoring that and going back to the kitchen. No closet space, no place to put ur things in the bathroom, and no where to plug ur charger u have to disconnect the tv or the light that at the end because the tv wasnt working went with that choice. Anyway i was staying there for the weekend and one night was more than enough, left first thing next morning and will never go back. The Hotel needs a lot of work and for what u pay there u can get a better place!!

Our stay was a very pleasant one. Freddy, the owner (and his wife), were very accomodating and really paid attention to the things we had asked for, e.g. we didn't bring beach towels so he had given us an extra set everyday; he set us up with a cab service as there were no rental cars because of the long holiday weekend. Ok, the rooms are not 5-star quality but if you want that then pay a hefty price and go to one of those big chain hotels! This is a family run hotel with very basic rooms. The important thing is the room was clean. The cleaning staff was there every day to clean, changed the bedsheets and towels. There were no bed bugs as reported in another review. There are mosquitos at night but of course, it's a tropical place by the beach. Maybe that would explain the bites another reviewer had mentioned! As a side note -- the food served at this hotel was excellent. Very tasty and cooked by the owners too. My boyfriend and I definitely plan go back!

However, the hotel needs work. The entrance is not inviting, the ocean view rooms are located on a second floor in a dark hallway.The balcony or ocean view leads to an open second floor terrace.All rooms share this area, so there is no privacy and anyone can walk up to the terrace and poke around. Not safe enough for my protection. Also pictures on the website do not reflect what you see when you get there.This is way below a Howard Johnson.
