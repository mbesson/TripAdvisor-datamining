It was cheap and close to the airport (Schonefeld) where I would eventually leave Berlin from. Travelling with a friend, we believed when booking that we would have to wait until after 2pm to check in. But when we arrived we were greeted enthusiastically and ushered straight into a room at 9.30 in the morning. After a nap in a comfortable bed we went in search of food and found an extensive menu at the bar of the hostel. The food was delicious and affordable and the service was excellent. The hostel is located in East Berlin but it is a simple city to navigate and you can get anywhere. The advantage of staying in this district is that it is very cheap. Even if you are seeking some serious nightlife this is an ideal place to stay because you can take advantage of the cheap drinks at the hostel bar (and in the supermarket across the road) and then take the train to elsewhere in the city. If you simply want a good night's sleep (which let's face it we all need after an honest night's drinking) then you will certainly find it here. The staff are very friendly and very helpful. The owner has a typical Kiwi love of life and was a great laugh. There is a common room where you can meet other guests, the hostel is clean, the showers hot and the coffee ready and waiting to counter the hangover in the morning. As a place to stay I can't speak highly enough of this place. I was there for three nights and never encountered any bed allocation problems at all. Some of the other guests did have to move rooms during the time I was there but they were long-term 'residents' and didn't mind this at all. All in all, I would strongly recommend this place to anyone staying in Berlin.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tauranga, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cNice but quiet hostel\u201d", "Author": "Kylee181", "ReviewID": "UR118849370", "Content": "We stayed here 3 nights and chose it because it was a New Zealand hostel and we are both kiwis. The kiwi owner was really helpful and nice but the other staff didnt appear to be very happy or friendly. Hostel was impecably clean and the owners daughter has done artwork on the walls which is nice. The hostel is really quiet and unsociable, this was probably because the hostel is quite far away from where all the action is. The centre is easy to get to via public transport. The staff were careless with the allocation of beds in the room and my boyfriend and I had to share a single bed one of the nights because someone took his bed and we werent sure if the other beds were free and reception was closed when we got home at night so we couldnt inform them. A numbering system for the bunk beds might be a good idea. Personally I wouldnt return again, but the hostel is ideal for people who enjoy a quiet stay away from the hustle and bustle. We also found the street to walk down uneasy at night and a bit far", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cDon't waste your time\u201d", "Author": "Jamieamac", "ReviewID": "UR115841464", "Content": "All in all disappointing.

Our flight is late, we arrive at 11:15pm and reception is closed. We are told by a patron to wait and see if they show up. We wait until 2am, then end up having no option but to stay at a hotel. This is understandably not their fault, but the drama ensued from this. First thing next morning we check in and they tell us the room has ben given away. The hostile worker then says \"ok maybe you will be lucky\" and takes us to a room. We were \"lucky\" and were given 2 beds. that night we return after a day of sightseeing and the beds have been occupied. The occupiers tell us that they had checked in that night. As we have already paid for our beds and could not afford the steep price of a hotel again, we have no option but to sleep on the floor. Next morning, another hostile worker says it is our fault we checked in late and another worker didn't write it down. We are again given two different beds. That night, one of the beds was occupied so again, one of us slept on the floor. 3rd day, we are told to leave by 11 and come back at 3 because the bed I had slept in the night before was booked and I had to change rooms. so, we are left with our bags, waiting around until 3 when we may have a place that WE HAVE ALREADY PAID FOR. I told the man at the desk that we one of us had not had a bed for the past few nights and he shrugged and said move your stuff out by 11. The only positive thing I can say about this hostel is that the rooms are clean. The staff are hostile and unwilling to accommodate, and I would not recommend it to anyone. Stay at wombats or at christophers, it will only be an extra 6 euro per night that you would spend on trains per day to commute to the centre.", "Date": "July 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nottingham, England", "Title": "\u201cFive visits to Berlin, Five stays at Schlafmeile Hostel\u201d", "Author": "BrezUK", "ReviewID": "UR101568753", "Content": "I've been to Berlin five times (it's my favourite city) and I have always stayed at this hostel. Why? The prices are very reasonable, it's very close to the U+S Bahn (it's far from the centre but it's only 10 minutes by U-Bahn), it clean, comfortable, plus a great place to socialise in the common room and there are enough places to go out eating and drinking nearby. But, more importantly Glen (the owner) and his staff are so friendly and helpful. For example on my second visit, I had booked for four nights but there was a problem with my booking and was only booked for two nights. However, Glen got on the phone and sorted out the remaining two nights at the nearby AO Hostel (nice but not as good).

We arrived just after midnight and luckily the kiwi restaurant next door was open so someone could let us in. Unfortunately our booking had been taken down wrong and they had us down to arrive the next night, but after very little fuss we were allocated a room (see photos). The rooms have a private entrance out onto the street so people can come and go as they please. As others have said there is a tram that runs past the hostel and that can be a bit noisy. Apart from that the hostel is very clean, has nice hot showers, good cooking facilities and a lounge with TV and free wi-fi to relax in. There's also fixed computers to log onto. Glen (the manager) was friendly and on hand to recommend where to go. There are plenty of places to eat in the local area and the U-bahn is about a 5 minute walk from the hostel which runs straight into Alexanderplatz. I would definitely recommend heading up the TV tower (you may wish to book online beforehand to avoid the queues). It allows you to get your bearings whilst taking in a great view of the whole city. Also head down to the Brandenburg gate and join one of the free walking tours. It lasts for 3-4 hours and you'll learn a lot. You only have to pay what you think the tour is worth. All in all Berlin is great city and you can do all the major touristy bits in a weekend. Further out of the the city is Potsdam which other travellers said was worth a visit. This was my first time in a hostel but based upon the experience I will definitely look at them as an option for travelling in the future.", "Date": "March 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Exeter, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat time, fun & nice staff, clean and cheap place overall\u201d", "Author": "paperlily3", "ReviewID": "UR80884613", "Content": "I stayed here a year ago with my friend on a clubbing/sightseeing holiday.
