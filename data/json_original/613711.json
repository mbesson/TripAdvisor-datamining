We had to wait 20 minutes while they searched through computer data, then allocated us the last room available in the hotel. Unfortunately, this was first floor at the front overlooking a busy street and opposite a rowdy football themed bar whose drinkers used our hotel entrance as a smoking area. The singing and shouting went on below our window until 3am each night of our 3 night stay making it impossible to get to sleep, then the early morning noisy delivery of metal barrels woke us at 7am. Front of house staff seemed unconcerned when we reported this and said this was to be expected in a city centre but could not relocate us to a quieter room as none were free. No compensation was offered. The room had seen better days, being tired and shabby with torn curtains, poor lighting, no mirror, no tea and coffee making facilities. The shower hose was broken and leaking making it difficult to use. On the day of departure, we asked reception to order a cab to take us to the airpor,t which they had previously assured us would be no problem and will arrive to collect us within 5 minutes. Wrong! After waiting 25 minutes, reception told us they were unable to book us a cab as there was a major football match in Barcelona that day and that we should hail a cab on La Rambla. We left the hotel with all our luggage only to find that all passing cabs were occupied. We eventuallly managed to secure a cab by walking all the way down to the port area and waiting a further 30 minutes by the main road until a cab stopped for us.

It's situation is perfect, literally 1 mins walk from Las Ramblas. Hotel is clean, reception staff helpful and welcoming! We stayed 3 nights. We were allocated a room through the gardens at the back. This was fine, the gardens were being re-landscaped but it is February, so it has to be done sometime, and it certainly wasn't a problem. Lights come on in corridors automatically. We are a family of 4, age 11 & 16. Room was spacious, a double bunk as we went in the door, then round a corner, and then another double bunk and our twin beds. Fairly comfortable, we all slept well. I defy anyone to say hotel beds are the best, and these certainly weren't bad. Not loads of wardrobe space, but not a major problem as only there a few days. Free wifi in the rooms via a laptop which is provided, or get given a code for phones or iPods etc. Breakfast is lovely, best meal of the day and this certainly provides all you need, juices, cereal, cooked sausage, egg and mushrooms, cold meat, cheeses, fruit, yogurt, and different pastries, croissants, cake and bread. Decor is modern, but we thought it was great. The hotel also has character a bit of old and new.

The Opera Garden Hotel is approximately half way up the famous La Rambla street and is just inside the Old Quarter of the city. Whilst its location was great, the hotel itself - and particularly the room itself was small (even by European standards) and dirty. The view was onto the back of the neighbouring properties and the room consisted of a small bathroom which wasn't very clean, but had a walk in type shower, a small built in wardrobe - with faulty sliding doors and a small bed. Despite asking for a king size bed when we booked and thinking we were going to get one, we ended up having a less than queen size bed crammed into a small space, made even more difficult to get round by them squeezing in a small desk and chair (the chair being almost impossible to sit on due to the proximity of the bed). The room's decor left a lot to be desired - bright Orange on the Wall complete with Orange lamp shade!! More importantly the walls showed lots of dirty marks that looked like they had been there for years. To be fair the room did say it had internet in the rooms and this was through the medium of a laptop computer - so that was a plus point if nothing else. In summary - the hotel is well situated for those persons wishing to explore Barcelona but the individual rooms are very small, have little or no views and you may well end up in room 3515 - avoid this room at all costs if you don't want to be disappointed.", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ankara, Turkey", "Title": "\u201cAppropriate Location and Good room\u201d", "Author": "Taner_tr06", "ReviewID": "UR124380003", "Content": "We stayed 4 nights as a 4 persons family.

It could be said that this it had in plenty but not of the anticipated variety ! The Good: The location for the hotel could not be faulted - just off La Ramblas, in the oldest part of the town. Hence the belief the hotel would displays some character and interesting nooks and crannies. Free internet is a plus, useful and a saving if you need access to your pc. The Bad: The hotel has definitely seen better days and any grandeur implied by the name and location has long since disappeared. The rooms are grubby and in need of redecoration with scuffed paint and wall paper. The cover on the bed was none too clean, with stains of an indefinable source. The size of the room was tiny and I mean tiny, with barely enough room to get in or out of bed at either side and further cramped by a desk and plastic chair beside it which had insufficient room to pull out and sit on. The Ugly: The colour schemes in the bedrooms are particulary vivid - ours was a lovely shade of satsuma orange which almost necessitated the use of sunglasses. In contrast the corridors and hallways are black with sensors which illuminate the passageways as you pass -by.

Barcelona is a great city for a short break. The Petit Palace Opera Garden is in a good central place to base yourself from. Upon arrival we spent ages trying to find this hotel. We took a taxi from the airport. The driver queried the address that we gave him. After a bit of head scratching he dropped us off on the Ramblas near La Boquer\u00eda market. I tried to locate the hotel using my iPhone but it was not where the phone said it would be. We found a tourist information centre and they sent us the wrong way too. There are a few Petit Palace hotels in Barcelona. The Opera Garden is not located on the north edge of La Boquer\u00eda market as show in Google maps and on my iPhone. It is actually across the main street to the east of the Ramblas near to Liceu metro station (south entrance). A former umbrella store decorated with brollies and a large green Chinese dragon mark the corner where you turn off the Ramblas into the narrow Carrer de la Boquer\u00eda.

Our room was large with a massive double bed and bunk beds for the kids. The AC was efficient and not too noisy. Our room came with free wifi. You just need to ask reception for an access code. Our room also had a complementary laptop computer packed full of games! They kids loved that. There are three more laptops in the foyer for guests to use - handy for planning your day's excursions. The room was cleaned every day and provided with sufficient towels and toiletries. It could do with a deep clean however to rid the walls and ceiling of mould caused I presume by condensation. This is illustrated in the photos provided by other guests on this page. Our bathroom had a shower above a bath that was fitted with spa jets.

They moved us to Petit Palace Opera Garden with no apology and we were met by a very unpleasant lady at reception who did not appear to be expecting us from the other hotel. Communication between the hotels and staff members was severely lacking, let alone their appalling customer service to guests. We had booked a deluxe king room but the room we were given was clearly a family room with 2 singles pushed together (as many European hotels do for a queen/king bed) and a set of bunk beds. As they were fully booked we could not change rooms. The sheets were clean but old with a large hole in one of them. The room was of decent size with a large bathroom with bath and shower. The water pressure was terrible it took literally 45 minutes to half fill the bath and the shower was no more than a trickle. Toilet also did not flush properly. The bench/desk in the room is made of white laminate which had numerous chips out of it and pen drawing marks. A lap top was provided in each room and downstairs in reception with free internet. The in-room safe also did not work and when we asked staff to address it they said they couldn't spare any one to go up to the room. We also noticed a pubic hair stuck in a plastic sleeve in the hotel information book - disgusting!! Breakfast was included in the room rate which was served downstairs in a buffet. Plenty to choose from with lots of fruit and pastries plus ham, salamis, cheeses etc. Breakfast definitely needed a re-paint - certainly not 4 star standard!! Location of the hotel is excellent as it is just off La Ramblas (actually better than their sister hotel) so well situated for the tourist hot spots and great selection of restaurants nearby. We walked to some places and took the metro to further places such as the Sagrada Familia Cathedral.

Nearest bar/ restaurants are right opposite hotel.

This is a 'high tec' hotel and the laptop in the room is a bonus but the room is somewhat minimalist which I don't particularly have a problem with but in my view, this sort of room/ building needs a better finish than I found here. I gather this hotel is fairly new but various things were falling to bits already! The shower looked impressive but when you put it on, it sprayed across the whole room because of the poor design. No english TV channels and you will find a travel kettle and tea and coffee makings useful. There is a mini bar fridge that you can empty and store your own drinks in.

Once inside it turned out to not be work being done next door, but actually in the hotel itself! Rather worried, we were shown to our room which was at the back of the garden and told we were put there 'as it was quiet'. We did think this rather dubious when hearing how loud the work outside was, but we needn't have worried because once inside, all was quiet and we were never disturbed by any noise throughout our stay there. The only real inconvenience of the building work was that the gardens (which did look lovely at night) were pretty unusable as the furniture and floor were covered in dust and debris and obviously not being cleaned while this work was continuing. Like other reviews we agree that the hotel rooms are certainly not 4 star, probably more a 3 star. The room seemed a little tired and just a few small touches such as tea and coffee in the room, a chair or sofa and better towels would have made all the difference. That said the room we had was large and the bathroom good, even if the bed was a little too hard and lacking in pillows. The TV was pretty basic but then we weren't staying in Barcelona to watch TV! The room's laptop and free wifi were a boon and helped us plan trips and keep an eye on emails while away. Although not a 4 star internally, perhaps the rating is due to it being right on La Ramblas and within walking distance of everything, with markets, restaurants and loads to do in every direction.

The only good thing about the hotel is its location, very central. Our room was cramped and, in order to get to one side of the bed you had to squeeze past the desk which was in a ridiculous place. We were forever bumping into the desk or stubbing our toes on the desk chairs. Our room overlooked an alleyway, which was scruffy and covered in graffiti. The balcony was unkempt, with most of the paving stones broken. The bathroom was tired. Although the fittings were nice, they were let down by poor paintwork, peeling walls, dirty grouting and a general poor finish all round. Taking a shower simply soaked the bathroom through and putting the tap on soaked the top through as the water splashed out of the sink. The air conditioning was really noisy too. The laptop, whilst a nice touch, was scruffy and incredibly slow,not a patch on the British City Inns which have a Mac in the room! The bed was hard and the bed linen cheap and thin. The worst thing though was the noise throughout the night. On the first night it was shouting and arguing which stopped at around 5.30am. At around 5.50am some builders started work and seemed to be throwing objects around such was the noise!. Second night wasn't too bad, but the 3rd night was back to all night activity and shouting. Not sure where it was coming from but thought it may have been the garden or simply in the alleyway. The garden itself was scruffy and dirty. Also don't have breakfast in Cheers across the alleyway...whilst it is good for a drink, its breakfasts are best avoided!!

They were unable to switch any air-conditioning on and suggested opening a window! The breakfast buffet was very good and the staff very attentive. With it\u2019s perfect location, I would recommend this hotel but check out what offers you can get first as it\u2019s not the cheapest.", "Date": "May 30, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Petit Palace Opera Garden Ramblas", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d613711-Reviews-Petit_Palace_Opera_Garden_Ramblas-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$165 - $371*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">C/ La Boqueria 10</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Junto A Ramblas 78</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08002</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "613711", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/3c/f4/3cf4589a8914c9e690ad975a116fea032large.jpg"}}
