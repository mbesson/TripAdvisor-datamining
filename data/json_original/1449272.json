The hotel was selected on the basis of traveller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reviews and recommendation of local friend. It offered reasonable room rent including free airport pick-up and breakfast. On arrival at Ataturk International airport at 9:30am, and after immigration we were greeted by the hotel arranged pick-up van driver. Check-in was quick. Both double and triple occupancy rooms allotted to us were in good condition, had adequately large beds, clean linen and working gadgets. The bathrooms were indeed large with majestic sanitary fittings, running hot water, shower cabin and clean Turkish towels. Free WiFi connectivity on each floor was strong and available. Breakfast was ready early in the morning and had wide variety of sumptuous items to choose from for vegetarians like us. Also, in its vicinity there are varieties of vegetarian restaurants for meals. The hotel has an advantageous location near the Taksim Square which is the hub of the public transport services that helped us in saving cost of travel and minimise travel time through the hustle and bustle of the city during working days. The noise level in the rooms was low as the hotel is in the side street parallel to the busy shopping and active night life of Istiklal street. The staffs were courteous and friendly. In particular the front desk staff arranged to provide us free airport drop service early in the morning of the departure day to catch 7:00am flight to Kayseri, Turkey interiors. This was arranged meticulously and on-time.

The day before we were due to catch our early flight to the airport, my husband paid $55 cash to the hotel manager to arrange our shuttle to the airport with a pickup time of 6 a.m. to get there in time for our flight to the U.S. At 6:05 a.m., the recommended shuttle had not arrived. I asked the manager to call the shuttle service to confirm they were enroute. He got off the phone and told us they were \"just leaving\" the tax station at the Sofia... and would be there in 10 minutes. 10 minutes later, no shuttle. I am fuming so the manager leaves the hotel to stand at the thoroughfare a block away, I assume to get away from us and hail the shuttle should it ever appear. Finally, at 6:30 a.m. we hailed a taxi that raced to the airport to catch our flight. Of course, we never got our $55 refunded because the front desk guy never returned before we left!!! I emailed him once we got home and he promised to refund us with a credit to our credit card, but that would have to be approved and he was off tomorrow, and the next day was a holiday, and then there was the weekend, but he would for sure get back to me by Monday. He never did. I emailed several times. No response.

It is a bit noisy during the night, as there is a night club near by, but we had no problem sleeping. If you do not like noise, do not go to Istanbul, go to spa or countryside :) We got a nice fruit basket for New Year! Wi-Fi is also working well in the rooms, and it is free of charge. Taksim square offers broad range of possibilities for exploring the city, as you can choose bus, metro, trams or taxis to go anywhere you want. Taxis are very cheap for a European city, we haven't paid more than 10 euros for any taxi ride. You can also walk to Sultanahmet if you like, it is around 5 km, but with so many things to see it is a very nice walking tour. You can also walk to Dolmabahce palace, even to Ortakoy or Fenar . I would really recommend this hotel to everyone who wants to see the best of Istanbul, and feel like it's citizen - as it's central location offers blending in, not like in some other areas (close to Grand Bazaar, for e.g.), where you cannot get rid of annoying shoe \"cleaners\", and souvenir sellers, and where everything is written on Russian or Italian, just to make the tourists feel like at \"home\" and buy as much as possible.
