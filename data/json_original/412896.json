This was the cheapest, and decent-looking place we could find. It was a little bit worse than we expected but there were no big surprises. The Pension is situated in the first floor of an old, traditional building, having one of those old-style elevators; the rooms were quite spacious but not really cozy, since it was quite cold outside. The bathroom was quite clean and the tub was big. Of course there was no view, since the windows looked over the place where the whole building stores their garbage. Breakfast was acceptable. On the bad side, I should mention that they charge you 8 euros for parking, which is actually on the street and they take no responsibility for theft or anything else. Also, the receptionist could hardly speak English, so communication was a bit difficult. Other than that, the location is really good, since it is a really busy street with various stores, if you're up to some shopping, nice places to eat and two metro stations nearby. I hope I have helped in some way. :)", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bellingham, Washington", "Title": "\u201cLocation great!\u201d", "Author": "ROSS009", "ReviewID": "UR119797878", "Content": "Very close to K-dam, zoo and S-bahn line. We had reserved a single and a double room. The single was down a dingy stairway. The room had a shower tube open right into the main room! Our first double room had a bad mildew smell in the bathroom, but we never used it because after looking at the room, the key did not unlock it any more. We were switched to a dingy, large room at the back of the hotel. Lighting was very poor, and a slight mildew smell in the bathroom again. The next day we demanded room changes, and got two new rooms, which were okay. Breakfast quite good in a pleasant dining area. Room price is very good for Berlin, but beware what room you may end up in..", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Citizen", "Title": "\u201cHistorical but cramped...\u201d", "Author": "Holidaymonger", "ReviewID": "UR115558061", "Content": "Good location just off Kudamm.

The street has a supermarket, caf\u00e9 and pub, and Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 at the corner. The hotel is very small and calm (only 19 rooms) family-run and the staff is dedicated (but does not speak english). The room was very nice and spacious, nice bathroom with bathtub. Windows towards the quiet backyard. Cleaning and towels each day, showering supplies provided. Tv has 30 channels (2xBBC wich are the only ones not in German). The beds and pillows are supreme in comfort, best night sleep ever. The staff is very dedicated to this hotel, and helpful in a blunt manor. Breakfast is fresh and has eggs, panncakes, muesli, bread and ham/salami/cheese, mozzarella, yoghurt, seeds and fresh fruit, tea/coffee and orange- and tomatojuice. The breakfast room is small with maybe 10-12 tables and a balcony, nice and peaceful with no crowded areas. In all this hotel provides excellent value for a very modest price. The typical guest of this hotel seemed to be german, middle-aged and academic. This place is perfect for anybody who wants peace and quiet and to sleep well. For party teenagers, clubbers and hipsters this is the wrong choice.", "Date": "March 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lima", "Title": "\u201cNo A/C, no fan, don't go on summer\u201d", "Author": "RoxLima", "ReviewID": "UR70183764", "Content": "Just came back from holidays. The location is really good ... but there are plenty of hotels around and actually most of the city is so well connected with buses and trams that chances are that you won't have any problem figuring out your way around. I thought that the price was good given that I've only needed a place to sleep. I reviewed the comments related to no A/C but thought it wouldn't be a problem, believe me, it is! sometimes I wanted to go back to the hotel to rest but just thinking in the sauna that was waiting there... even late at night was incredible hot, got a room in the ground floor and even with the window wide open it was awful. On top of that I was waken up around 5.00am b/c of the noise made by neighboors (think that were the next door restaurant staff doing some cleaning, etc) and the people at the front desk were not friendly/not helpful at all and only speak german. Almost forgot, there was a couple of days that I could notice they didn't clean the room at all, and when I've checked in I had to do some cleaning (to be on the safe side). One more thing: the matress is harder than sleepping in the bare floor (I always prefer firm matresses but this didn't qualify as such!) So, check your options.", "Date": "July 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Odense, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel in great location!!!\u201d", "Author": "eleftheria26", "ReviewID": "UR54082449", "Content": "Although I stayed in the hotel just for a night , my experience was great.

The location, just off Ku'damm is perfect for shopping and access to transportation. The staff is friendly and helpful although we don't usually ask for much as we are familiar with the city.
