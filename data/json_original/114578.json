Being located only a few minutes from Michigan Ave and famous Buckingham Fountain, it is also located close to several different CTA stations, so getting around town is quite easy. There are a couple of entrances into the hotel. One is shared with the entrance to Custom House, a restaurant on the corner of Congress Pkwy (they make their own ice cream!!). The main entrance is closer to the middle of the block. The lobby is off the main entrance and there is a nice long hallway leading to the lobby from the secondary entrance. Between both entrances is the business center with a couple of computers and nice comfy leather chairs. The folks at the reception were nice, courteous, and professional. The room was nice and large with a king size bed, a comfy lounge chair, TV console with flat screen TV, and a comfy bench at the end of the bed. The room not only looked plush and rich, but everything actually was. The room even came with bathrobe and house slippers. The bed was so comfy after a long day of walking around town, but the warm shower before that was even more so with a nice rainfall shower head.

The hotel is in a terrific location - just south of many of the more expensive hotels in the Loop, close to Starbucks and super accessible to the L subway system. Our room was a terrific size, always clean, had an amazingly comfortable bed and terrific bathroom. The hotel staff were super friendly - the doorman is a total gem and helped us get a private car the one time we cabbed around the city. The area is very safe, accessible to at least three L stations and in my opinion was worth the money. There's WiFi available which is a must when I travel and the bed linens/towels/bath products were terrific. My only complaint would be the hotel restaurant - skip it, it's overrated, expensive and underwhelming - and the street noise.

I have to say it was a great stay. Hotel was clean. Nice decor. Not sure if it is like this in all rooms, but our shower had no door or curtain! It was a little weird to be all exposed like that, but I just made sure I locked the bathroom door. Also, the shower floors are really slippery when wet. I am surprised there is no matting on the floor to prevent a slip and fall. Room service is available if you wish to take advantage of it. I did not, so I can't tell you how it was. Fitness Center is available on the second floor. I did use that and I have to say it was good. They have the standard treadmill, elliptical, and bike. There is also a machine weight set too. The center was very clean and the equipment well kept. The hotel is right next to the LaSallle St. Station on the Blue Line for CTA. It was so convenient for myself! Easy to get on and transfer at other stops and it is a direct 40 minute ride from O'Hare. On thing that I didn't like was the fact that there was no type of continental breakfast. Not even pastries and coffee! I know that there is a restaurant attached to the hotel, but I don't want to spend a lot of money on just breakfast! Dunkin Donuts is right across the way, and I made good use of them! Also, I don't know why a few reviews give a thumbs down to the doorman, but I thought he was a good guy. He was very helpful and did give us some names of places to see and check out. \"Showtime\" was what he went by....good guy!

Overall I'd probably have given the hotel five stars, but it's location was only fair. It's a good walk to most attractions--20-30 minutes to the Field, another five to the Shedd and another five to the Adler Planetarium. The Art Institute is probably the closest, about 15 minutes away at a brisk pace. Navy Pier and the shopping on N. Michigan are at least 30 minutes walk away.

The staff was always very helpful and concerned for my needs and informative about the area. The hotel is located in the South Loop. Its not a concentrated tourist area like the North River area, but it is an area of great classic architecture and an easy walk to the Art Institute or the Sears Tower. The restaurant in the hotel is excellent...one of the best in the area. But it is quite pricey. The room was on the 11th floor and very quiet except for the occasional police siren. The one thing that keeps me from giving the place 5 stars is the bad design of the shower (and there is no tub). The shower is separated from the rest of the bathroom by a fixed piece of glass next to the shower head, and open on the other side. In order to turn on the shower, you had to step in and turn the fixture. It was impossible to avoid getting hit by cold water for a moment. Then, when taking the shower, water would always flow down the fixed glass, along the flat divider, and onto the floor. I always left a couple of soggy towels on the bathroom floor in the morning.

Speaking of which, the mattress in our room was king size and by far one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on.

The location is very convenient, within walking distance to most of the downtown area, and only a couple blocks from public transportation. The worst thing is the street noise, which starts out early in the morning with traffic and construction noises. There must be a firehouse nearby, because we were constantly hearing fire trucks go by, sirens blaring. Our first night we were in a room facing Dearborn street, and had to move to the other side of the building because of the early morning noise on the street. The other side was a bit better, but the noise level was still such that we couldn't sleep in. The staff was very helpful in getting us moved to the other room. The rooms were spacious, clean and comfortable. Housekeeping was very accommodating to our needs, as were the rest of the staff. The furnishings are starting so show the years, but the beds were among the most comfortable I have found in a hotel anywhere. I'm not too crazy about the rainfall shower, as I like a shower with a bit more pressure behind it, but there was plenty of hot water very quickly. I would suggest parking your car yourself; don't pay the extra for \"valet\" parking. Valet parking involves paying $44 a day (with in and out privileges) for them to put your car in the same garage you can park in yourself for $25 a day.

As a hotel, I am surprised that they didn't. Which means- they probably do not clean the blankets on the bed very often. The morning breakfast consisted of muffins and coffee. Not much of anything. We ended up drinking coffee and getting breakfast elsewhere. While the hotel is close to the sites, just beware of the scam through the travel sites. We probably would have had a nice stay had it not been for not having a bed to sleep on & no blankets. As well, we contacted the hotel management following our stay. They were of NO help. They simply offered us a \"discount\" if we stayed again. Not very likely, just goes to show you that they don't care much about their guests.", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel.. fantastic staff\u201d", "Author": "MrDix2u", "ReviewID": "UR116346461", "Content": "Family trip to see McCartney at Wrigley field.

Sometimes hotels that we have stayed at have fallen short of the mark, but this was not the case for the Hotel Blake. We were absolutely delighted with the hotel. Not only was the staff extremely pleasant and knowledgeable, but we found the hotel to be immaculate, tastefully appointed and well located relative to \"must see\" attractions and convenient transit services. We were assigned a corner Premium King room that was spacious, extremely clean and tastefully decorated. The large full height windows in our room also provided a wonderful view of the cityscape throughout the day and at night. We also tried a couple of wonderful local restaurants recommended by the hotel's Concierge, Maggie, who was both approachable and extremely knowledgeable about where to dine and what to see in Chicago. We would highly recommend this establishment to other travellers, especially those accustomed to higher-end hotels offering excellent service, tasteful accommodations and the more personal and intimate touchs associated with a boutique-style rather than large-scale hotel. In our opinion, the Hotel Blake has everything a seasoned traveller would want and, in fact, the hotel was more pleasing to stay at than some 5-star hotels that we have been guests of in the past.

This review is a little late since I wanted to post pictures of our room, but I haven't got them back yet. We booked the hotel with Expedia so I was unable to do any of the hotel research that I normally do when searching for hotels - my mistake. We stayed on the second floor (right above the lobby area) so we got to hear a lot of the street noises. I've stayed in better rooms at lesser rated hotels. The \"guest room\" that they show on their website is no where near what we got. There was a hole in the wall under the desk area and electrical cords were exposed. The bedframe was nearly broken and the bed looked like it was precariously sitting in the frame. The cleaning service was sporadic at best - they did not always come to the room everyday. Aside from these cosmetic issues, my main complaint comes from the service we received. First big issue ... The bathtub did not drain well, so we were constantly standing in a pool of water when showering. Since this is unsanitary, I informed the young man at the front desk, Patrick, of our issue the very next day. He told me he would send someone to fix that. The next day the tub still pooled up, so we again informed Patrick that the problem was still happening. Again, he said someone would come to fix it. The following day, the water was STILL pooling. At this point, we would only be there one more day so we didn't see a point in telling him one more time when nothing was done about it for the first two complaints. Second big issue...On Saturday night of Memorial day there was loud music and bass that you could hear (or rather FEEL) through our floor and walls. At 11:00pm I asked the girl at the front desk what was going on. She informed me that there was a wedding in the hotel restuarant and that she \"didn't think it would last for a few more hours.\" I told her that we had an early flight out, had to get up really early and asked if she could talk to whoever about the music. She said the hotel was not affiliated with its restaurant so she could not do anything but assured me that it shouldn't last more than a few hours. What???!!! What I find funny is that the management of this hotel has written replies to each of the negative reviews of this hotel. The management could learn some proactive management skills rather than reactive.

I hope my experience is anomalous or readily addressed for future guests, because this could easily be your home away from home. We specifically selected and paid for an upgraded king room. Upon room arrival we did bring our initial concerns to the attention of a friendly front desk team. We were offered a much smaller room 2 floors up which wasn't an improvement although it did have our missing desk. We declined. When we asked what the difference was between the upgraded king and the cheaper, \"regular\" king room, we didn't get a clear answer. Out advice? Take your chances with the regular king and save your money :). PROS: -- Friendly and courteous staff -- Excellent location close to restaurants, bars, transportation and 10 minute cab ride to McCormick. Easy access to anywhere you want to go. -- Good value, surprisingly affordable rates. -- Very comfortable bed, including mattress, linens and pillows -- Truly adjustable, responsive air conditioning (not pre-set like many hotels where they let you think you are changing the thermostat but there is really a min/max effect.) -- Large room. Very nice to find in big cities like NYC and Chicago -- Waterfall shower head - nice modern shower (no tub and only slightly missed by me). -- Free wireless that works. Lots of hotels provide free internet but it never works due to bandwidth overload. Day or night, the internet a HB worked fine. -- Comfortable, intimate lobby vibe and decor, a simple and modern interpretation of the building's construction period? -- Small but suitable business center including a little conference room we found very helpful. Glass walls, nicely located right off the lobby. A real pleasure compared to some hotels who put the biz center it in a dark, windowless dungeon, as if always being away from home isn't punishment enough :). Thank you Hotel Blake! -- In room laptop safe. Surprisingly missing from many urban hotels. CONS: -- No desk. This was listed as a feature of our room type. Working without a desk for a long stay is tough. Probably the first hotel I've staying in in 10 years without a desk. -- DARK! Yes, hotel rooms are often dark, but this room set a new low. Couldn't wait to get out of the room and avoided it even when it would have been convenient to stay in. We asked for and were graciously provided with an additional lamp but it made no difference. Best description: similar to a household hallway at night, when lit by light filtering through an open door or a nightlight. Pretty dreary. -- No drawers. There was an armoire that housed a small TV but the space below, usually drawer space or mini bar, was just a big empty box and waste of space. Hard to keep clothes nice and ready for biz mtgs over 5 days/4 nights. Also hard to keep room tidy. -- Few power outlets. Only 2 in spite of rooms size unless you pulled out the armoire in order to plug in the iron. We asked for an extension cord with additional outlets which was provided cheerfully and immediately. This is a warm and friendly hotel. -- Poor initial towel and toiletry stocking. Upon arrival our room had no floor towel and just one hand towel. It did have 2 bath towels. Also, there was no soap for the shower. Unless my husband wanted to use shower gel, he had to remember to take the hand soap bar from sink to shower and back again. Our towels were restocked properly. -- No refresh of toiletries. With two in a room, toiletries go fast. In spite of leaving housekeeping a $5 daily tip, toiletries weren't refreshed (they may be today, we have one more night here). -- No down comforter cover. Although a sheet was placed above and below it, IMHO this is a sanitary issue. Covers move around during sleep and it was kind of icky to think that I was touching the comforter that touched previous guests. -- Upgrade didn't involve a higher floor. Our room was on the third floor. Perhaps my expectation was too high, but my experience of dozens of hotel nights per year is that upgraded rooms usually mean at least slightly higher floors because it reduces urban street noise. -- Don't get excited about the \"floor to ceiling windows\" advertised. Even in our upgraded room our view was a brick, virtually windowless building. Fully open curtains added no real light. -- Decor. Although it is somewhat like the picture, the differences are significant. No footstools for the nice armchairs (which made our work space alternative tough - footstools help hold a laptop comfortably on legs), less functional side tables and lighting. Also, though not important to us, there are metal cover plates on the walls...where we assume there was once sconce lighting and/or power outlets. Overall, It felt almost as if our room was the one in the hotel that wasn't quite finished when the hotel was refreshed...just the vibe, not a fact. -- \"Free continental breakfast\". Not for those who like to eat healthy while traveling, donuts and pastries, one fruit only (e.g. today there were apples). -- Not significant but annoying. One small waste bin...in bathroom only. Kind of strange to be given a large room without trash bin; if we weren't relatively tidy types would have made a lot more work for housekeeping. Hopefully you understand my dilemma. You probably won't miss if you are leisure traveling, or if you don't mind asking for things that should be there automatically, but for biz travelers who return after a tough day of meetings with a night's worth of work to be tackled, my experience says this isn't your hotel in spite of it's pluses.", "Date": "June 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "none", "Title": "\u201cLook elsewhere!!\u201d", "Author": "jon4224", "ReviewID": "UR64412976", "Content": "I booked this trip on a Tuesday morning at least a month before the travel date through orbitz online using the option to buy a package and \"save\" money. I purchased a king room for 3 days and paid more for the room. No more then 15 minutes later after booking I contacted orbitz realizing I needed to change plans. Usually this is no problem as you always get some kind of grace period. Orbitz personnel contacted the Blake Hotel and spoke to the manager on duty that told orbitz and, in turn me, that there was no way to change anything or cancel without losing all my money. Knowing that I would lose close to a thousand dollars for the flight and hotel I moved my plans to now coincide with my expensive mistake. I arrive at the hotel after a long flight and many delays due to weather in Chicago to find that the Blake Hotel had overbooked and already gave all king bed rooms away for the evening. The hotel that was completely inflexible after making reservations was now expecting me to be flexible. I was told they had nothing other than a smaller twin bed room. I thought this was unacceptable and that they should upgrade or refund my money, but I was told both options were impossible. I was left with no option but to take the room. I was told to ask at the front desk the next day and maybe something would become available. I explained that I did not want to go through the hassle of waiting around the next day hoping for a different room and then, if available, changing rooms when I am supposed to be celebrating my fianc\u00c3\u00a9e\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s birthday. If it had not been 11pm and my fianc\u00c3\u00a9e\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s birthday the next day I would have found another hotel. I received no compensation other than 2 drink tickets to a bar in the hotel that was already closed. In the past, I have stayed at this hotel many times, mainly because of the price, and have accepted the little problems/ inefficiencies that make it a 2 or 3 star hotel but this kind of treatment should never be acceptable to anyone who pays over 20 dollars for a room in any hotel. My advice, pay a little more for the Drake, the Knickerbocker, the Swissotel or any other hotel where the staff treats you like a human being and chooses to honor their rigid, totally inflexible booking policies that they expect you to abide by, instead of simply worrying about the bottom line.", "Date": "May 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel but many operational issues\u201d", "Author": "kenny11lee", "ReviewID": "UR64283714", "Content": "I was in Chicago for business and they missed my wake-up call on the first day causing me to skip breakfast and take a cab to my meeting.

Additionally, they have added a Continental breakfast in the lobby as part of your stay which was also a nice addition.

Unfortunately, I am pained to even call what they offered that: there were 3 dry scones, a basket of close-to-rotten fruit and a coffee machine. There aren't even tables and chairs to sit at (just the 3 or 4 lounge couches) and the lack general layout of the breakfast table was reminiscent of what most hotels offer all day long - a decorative bowl of fruit and free coffee. I have stayed at HoJo's with better options. On the plus side the staff was extremely helpful and polite, the rooms were not quite what they seemed online (no comforters on the beds even - we had to call down for an extra blanket just to stay warm though they were really kind about bringing it up to us at 11 pm) and in general we didn't come to Chicago to hang out in our room so the location was a real perk. It's well connected to a number of CTA stops and just a few blocks from the Art Institute - it was a bit chilly in our room though after hoofing it in the snow all day and the heaters didn't work that well (they were blowing hot and then cold air all night). All in all, I would suggest staying at other 4-star hotels in the area before considering the Blake. The breakfast may be free but it's pretty much non-existent and we've stayed in much nicer hotels for more or less the same price.

Valet-parking was available from the hotel, but half price parking is available literally just down the street from the hotel. When we made it to our room on the 9th floor, I was amazed at the room. Large room, magnificent bed, good decorations, huge bathroom. There was no train or traffic noise on the 9th story, and we both got excellent sleep on the comfortable mattress. Free wifi, excellent soap, shampoo, body wash, etc... even a sewing kit. The room definitely deserved four stars, my only minor quibble was a little mold in the shower stall of an otherwise impeccable bathroom. We never really tried the TV, but the room clock connected to my ipod, which I thought was neat. The free breakfast was great and unexpected, but I recommend getting there early as they ran out of donuts and danishes well before the posted closing time.

Though the area near the hotel isn't the most built-up location in downtown Chicago, there still were a few restaurants and convenience stores nearby (the latter of which, both 7-Eleven and CVS, I utilized numerous times). Service in the hotel was good too - the rooms were cleaned thoroughly early each day, there was free, 24-7 internet access (though only one computer so sometimes I had to wait to get on), and a continental breakfast was available each morning (though I only used that the day I checked out and the options were somewhat limited). The cooling units in the rooms worked well too, making it more comfortable to sleep. From the room I had, I even had an excellent view of the Sears Tower (it will never be the Willis Tower and besides, when I was there it still was officially the Sears Tower!). The staff seemed friendly enough, though I didn't need their services much during my stay. All in all, Hotel Blake served as an excellent base of operations for me during my stay in Chicago (which primarily involved going to a pair of Cubs and a pair of White Sox games, riding around the CTA \"L\" system, checking out the major train stations, checking out various neighborhoods and attractions both via transit and on foot, and taking a day trip up to Milwaukee to check out that city and go to a Brewers game - Hotel Blake is probably about 3/4 mile from Chicago Union Station).

They ended up putting us up in the holiday inn for the night for free and payed for the taxi to get us over there. So we had to park our car at the hotel for the night and hoped we had what we needed. When we got to the holiday inn, they had no record of Blake sending us there, they had only 4 reservations and i was not one of them. After another wait, they wrote my name over some other person they had reservations for from the Blake(not sure what they did with the other person when they showed).

So after a horrible night, we had to wake up and pack up again bright and early to go back to the blake. This was not before we found out the holiday inn did not have a complimentary breakfast like the Blake was going to have. So after taking a cab back to blake, we went to have our luggage checked since a room would not be available until 3 PM which is 3 hours after the Brewer game started. Once we got the luggage checked, they said we could have breakfast there. It was the worst possible breakfast i had ever seen. They had one guy cutting and toasting bagels in a 4 slice toaster, pound cake cut and wrapped individually and honey buns. The juice was stuck in a bucket of ice when some ran out so it was not even cold. The bagel my girlfriend got had mold on the bottom of the bagel as well. Went to the game(Brewers killed 11-2) and when we got back, they had upgraded us to the larger king size room. The room was nice and well maintained. When we woke up the next morning, we had no hot water! We called down to the front desk and they brought up a key card to take a shower in the only other open room which was nice.

We were only a few minute cab ride from restaurants north of us, or bars anywhere in the city. The room was clean and modern and didn't worry about being bothered by any staff. When we had questions regarding locations, the staff assisted us with maps and the door man hailed cabs and directed us to different places around the city. I would go back in a heart beat. I would also recommend the city pass, for only $59 you can go to 5 spots around the city. We went to the Shedd Aquarium, The Sears & the Field Museum. The pass is good until May, so you can keep the vouchers for another day. It also allows you to skip the lines and see shows that normally cost extra while your there.", "Date": "February 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "Pattersean", "ReviewID": "UR23214426", "Content": "After reading the previous reviews my wife and I decided to take a chance at the Blake.

If you have some good shoes you can walk to just about anything you would like restaurant-wise. It's possible to walk to the Lake and Navy Pier from there, but it would be a bit of a hike. There are a few restaurants in the immediate area so if you aren't picky and don't want to walk far you're set. Our room (#524) was on the end so we had 2 huge windows one facing north, the other facing east, which gave us a very nice view of the area, which included the Sears Tower. These windows also had blackout drapes which meant a nicely darkened room when it was time for bed. The room had a large bathroom with a double sink and a really nice (rain-like) showerhead. The complimentary bathroom supplies were from Bath and Body Works, which had a nice smell. Plenty of towels for 2 people, and a bath robe. The Plasma TV was lowend, but decent Vizio (WalMart) brand, but it worked ok to watch the cable with HBO. The chairs were comfortable, and the bed was very very comfortable. The tall 12' ft (I think) ceilings made the room seem big. Lastly there was free wireless internet throughout the the hotel at no additional cost. My Cons: The price. Probably my fault, I had to book last minute, so I had to pay the webprice ($350 + tax) for this room. This price might be worth it if it weren't for the following. The room door was falling apart and hard to open and close because it was sticking in the jamb. The A/C was a pain to control, it seemed to have 2 settings, off or freezing. Our room because of the 2 windows made the city noise come right to the room. I can sleep through anything so it did't bother me, but light sleepers beware. The toilet didn't flush right you had to hold the handle down. The bathrobes finally came after a 2nd call. The doorman made a Omaha Nebraska guy like me feel a little uncomfortable. He seemed nice, but a little shiesty. He informed us that he could park our car in the garage for $39 per night, or he could put it on the meter for $10. We opted for the meter, but that meant our car would have to stay put, or we risk losing the meter. This meant we were walking anywhere we had to go for that night. I'm not sure why the $10 though, I thought the meters were free after a certian hour on Saturday. I think he profited from that one directly. No fridge? At this price? The staff didn't seem to be too bright, but fortunately I didn't really require them to be, as I didn't really need them for anything, except change for a 5. At checkout I forgot to give them their room key-cards back. They either didn't want them, or weren't bright enough to remember to ask for them. Lastly, when we got to our floor, it smelled like dirty laundry, housekeeping had bags of dirty linens all over the floor, and there was one room with a room service tray outside in the hallway that hadn't been picked up, when we came back from dinner the smell had gone for the most part, but the room service tray was still there, this had to of been 2 or 3 hours later. Other Stuff: There is a coffee pot for you coffee drinkers. It's located in the bathroom, which I thought was weird, but whatever. There was a hair blowdryer in there too if you need one. There is a phone in the bathroom next to the toilet, I guess this is in case you have some emergency that requires a phone call, or a call downstairs while on the can. I never went for ice, but I think there is only 1 ice machine in the whole place, so plan for that. They told me there as a health club too, but again I didn't check it out. Same for the restaurant, I checked their menu online and figured that I wasn't spending that much for a little nibble. If you want to catch a cab I think the doorman will put his life on the line for you to get one. The EL Train and Subway stops were within walking distance, but that's true for just about any part of town. Staff seemed a little snobbish, but they weren't rude. I didn't see too many elevators, in fact, I only saw 2. They worked ok, but come checkout time they will get stuffed. I was on 5th floor, by the time the elevator got to me there was barely enough room for me to squeeze in, then the elevator proceeded to stop on 4 and 3 to pick up more people, whom couldn't fit. So I imagine if you weren't lucky, you'd be waiting for awhile, or taking the stairs. The stairwells were dirty by the way. Conclusion: I might stay here again if I were to get a really good price, but mostly likely I would try to find something else. It was ok, but I don't think worth the price.

We were upgraded to a corner room #524. Beautiful views. When I commented on the noise and said we could not sleep well, they said the only rooms above ours were suites. We kept our room.Trust me, it's noisy, throughout the night. NO morning newspapers. NO twice daily maid service. NO bottled water.

If you are looking for a hotel in the Miracle Mile area where most of the tourist activities take place, this is NOT the hotel to choose. The hotel advertises a concierge, but it is really the front desk, which while as helpful as they try to be, are not trained concierges. Wireless service does not work in the lobby, though it does work in the rooms. The only reason to stay here is for the rock bottom hotel rates that can be found on some discount websites. There is also a Starbucks on the corner and Orange, a breakfast restaurant around the corner. All in all, we would never stay here again.

The mixed reviews do lead me to believe that room conditions can vary. Positive Points: 1. Price - I paid $101/night Canadian. I got this as a package deal on a well-known travel web site. We stayed at the hotel during the March break (week of March 10th, 2008). 2. Size - We couldn't believe the size of our room! We had a King sized bed, a nice bay window with a bench/seat (and a bench at the end of our bed), more than enough space for open luggage, and a super-sized washroom. You can do jumping jacks in this bathroom! There are two sinks, and a large shower stall. 3. Style - It is refreshing to be in a botique style hotel - this gives it charm and character, something you don't get from other cookie-cutter chain hotels. Take a look at the pictures. 4. Location - Everything is within walking distance. Yes, it is located in the southern part of the Loop, but it did not take us long to walk from one end of the town to the other (e.g. from this hotel to the John Hancock tower). It is also close to a couple of transit stops. We took the El train from the Midway airport, got off at the Library transit stop, and walked half a block to this hotel. Negative Points: 1. Internet not working - it is well advertised that this hotel has a free internet terminal available for guests. Therefore we made a conscious decision to not bring our heavy laptop with wireless internet. Well, the hotel internet terminal was out of order during our entire stay. I was annoyed enough to voice my discontent a couple of times. In response, they let us use their own staff computer behind the front desk. Bravo! 2. Ridiculous phone charges - the list of services in the room leads you to believe that you will not be charged for out-going calls placed on a calling card. Well, when we checked out and got a bill for over $20 in calls, we learned otherwise. However, after some more \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvoiced discontent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (including a reminder to them that we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to be placing these calls if their internet hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been down all week) they dropped the charges.

Many of the previous reviews left us a bit skeptical prior to our stay, but the price we received was quite good ($109/night) for the area, so we decided to try it for ourselves. The location was excellent, close to most destinations in the Loop area (such as the Chicago Art Institute, for example). In fact, the El has a stop about a block away, so also very easy access to public transportation. The neighborhood also seemed safe Although, there is a sandwich shop, pizza parlor, and Starbucks on the block, we did note that it was a bit difficult to find many restaurants open in the Loop at night, given that this is the really the Financial District and many establishments seem to close around 5pm. Again, however, with the proximity to the El and other trains so close, it was relatively easy to travel to other neighborhoods for dinner in the evening. As for the hotel itself, the lobby upon entry was tastefully decorated with minimalist/modern decor. The check-in procedure was smooth and the front desk personnel were helpful and friendly. Our room was huge and also well-designed and nicely appointed with a king bed, pull-out sofa, two armchairs, large desk, and a wonderfully large bathroom with glass shower. Incidentally, we had friends who were staying at the Hilton a few blocks away and their room was more than twice the price and half the size! It is also worth noting that the cleaning staff was also very good and arrived promptly every morning to change our linens. In general, we would highly recommend this hotel for business or personal travel, particularly for those who prefer quieter, non-high maintenance retreats. We found it very peaceful at the Hotel Blake and were all around very pleased with our stay.

Problems!\u201d", "Author": "lynnlovestennis", "ReviewID": "UR11226603", "Content": "Just Google \"Nicky O\" (as in Nicky Hilton) to read up on why Hotel Blake has had so many bad reviews on TA lately. We stayed there as part of a wedding group with a block of over 30 rooms, and many in our group had stayed at the Blake previously due to its proximity to the bride and groom's place. Other than that, no one had much good to say about the hotel except that the rooms are spacious. The rooms are, in fact, quite spacious. There's no disputing that. But they're also in much disrepair. We had two TP roll holders in our bathroom which were pulled off the wall and laid on the counter. The knobs to the TV armoir were also loose, and the TV itself was a big cathode tube thing circa 1998 with only about 20 channels and HBO. Add to this that we didn't have a dresser in our room; though under the TV, where a mini-bar or drawers *could* have been, was a big empty cavern. All the rooms are different, though I only saw one room with a dresser at all. And definitely no mini-bars. During our four days there, we had our room made up twice and we never received fresh towels, despite calling repeatedly. I did call once and ask for hangers due to the lack of dresser drawers, and fortunately got those. Wifi is available, which is a plus, but it doesn't always work. If you need help, there is a number to call, but you will be informed that they don't support the Blake anymore. I was on the hunt for an ethernet cable and randomly found an unplugged Wifi router under my nightstand. We invited others to come soak up our Wifi. Many people have noted that there is no breakfast offered. This is a huge confusion. The restaurant in the lobby, The Custom House, is not affiliated with the hotel, but yet there's a sign in the elevator which says you can get breakfast there. The Custom House isn't even open for breakfast! Anyway, I guess the structure changed when Ms. Hilton purchased the place and things still haven't been addressed with it. There was a convention in town when we got there and they had donuts and coffee for those folks on the second floor. Despite having over 30 rooms, we had no breakfast, so I'm guessing one of the convention folks set that up themselves. I heard many people ask the front desk about the breakfast and were told to go to Starbucks across the street, which is hilarious, given that Orange is around the corner and awesome. I even overheard one guy saying that when he booked with Expedia it specifically said \"breakfast included\", at which point the desk clerk got pissy with him and said Expedia was wrong. We all noted that the front desk staff are stressed out because things are so crazy and management simply seems to be avoiding the problems. The most frustrating thing about the front desk is, however, that they don't answer the phone! In fact, it seems that they avoid the phone altogether. Many people compared notes on calling from inside and outside the place just to see if they could get someone! Like I said though, I managed to get someone on the phone to give me hangers and they actually showed up. The upshot is that the bell men are nice and very attentive, but let's face it, they work on tips. The downer is that they don't have hotel umbrellas. So if it's raining in Chicago, and you ain't got, prepare to go buy one or catch cold. To sum up: This is a nice property in a good location which is rapidly falling apart due to owner neglect. For the amount of money they charge, you can do better.

Unfortunately I had such overwhelming problems during my stay, that I had to check out after 2 nights and find another hotel. My major issue was with the bathroom, which may have been partially designed to be handicapped accessable or was using the new concept of a \"wet\" room. Anyways it was all marble (synthetic?) with no lip around the shower area. There was a drain in the shower area as well as in the middle of the room, and I think the water was supposed to drain out in the shower area. Instead it spread accross the floor to the other drain and when I stepped out from the shower area, I immediately slipped and fell on my butt. When I contacted the Front Desk they had no concern about my fall and no understanding of my problem. Eventually they sent a housekeeper and I thought I would get some help cleaning up, but she could not speak English and appeared to be mad at me for all the water on the bathroom floor. I finally grabbed a bunch of towels from her cart and mopped up the mess myself. Later I asked if the drains had been cleared and if some shower mats had been placed in my room, but no one seemed to know about my problem. The next day I went out into the hallway and grabbed extra towels off one of the housekeeping carts so that I had a nice soggy floorcovering which was not slippery and was somewhat safer, if still unpleasant.. Then I was forced to go outside the hotel once again, on a cool and grey morning, to grab some breakfast at the local unfriendly diner because the hotel had no breakfast in spite of the posters in the elevator. I realized as I came back into the hotel, that the lobby had the same marble as the bath, and it struck me that with the possibilty of rain later that day, that I could probably slip and fall once again, as the floor was quite uneven. The prospect of another scary shower and scavaging for more towels, as well as the thought of going out again in bad weather to even get a cup of coffee, led me to check out immediately.

Note: We called the morning the day we were to check in to inform the hotel that we would be arriving very late. However, one of my co-workers had a confirmation number and they assured us that this was not a problem. WRONG! We had a group of 4 men and 3 women and booked enough rooms to accomidate for this.

We told the woman helping us who we had spoken to, and she said that she had already left for the day. To say the least we were all furious! After about 1 hour of complaining they handed us 2 key cards. We ended up with 2 rooms each with only ONE KING SIZED BED!!! They did not offer to move us to a different room when available, but made us simply \"make due\" with what they had given us, or lose out on our money. A refund was out of the question to them. Not only did our rooms not accomidate us, but down the hall there was a MASSIVE water pool (perhaps from bathtub leakage above). The water remained there for the 3 nights we stayed there. Nobody ever came to clean it up, and the housekeeping attendance mearly \"worked around it.\" They were very rude to us when we checked out, literally throwing our paper receipts to us. They said nothing about inconveniencing us, no apologies were made, no discounts were given. I found only 2 good things about this hotel: 1. The decor was very pretty 2.

The hotel's location is great...everything is accessible. The rate was quite high, but this was typical of all hotels during this period--several conferences at the same time. The hotel itself was chic, albeit quite dark overall. The lobby was not terribly comfortable or inviting. A major disappointment was the lack of any high speed internet access in our room--it was down for repairs for an entire week, which I found unacceptable. They did have one computer and one ethernet cable in the business center, but I always had to wait to use either connection. On the plus side, use of the printer in the business center was free for guests. Also, I was completely unable to get Verizon wireless service in my 6th floor room...I had to go out to the sidewalk to make any calls. The mattresses were comfortable, but the linens were not the quality you would expect from this level of hotel. The bathroom, however, was exquisite--very large, with two sinks set into a large marble vanity, and a wonderful, elegant shower (no tub, if that's something you're looking for). The complementary toiletries were also quite nice--lotion, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and large bars or soap, all from Bed Bath and Beyond. The view from my room (and most, I gather) was horrible--the worn stone side of the neighboring building. The hotel is shorter than the surrounding buildings, and is flanked on all sides, diminishing the views. Finally, the hallways echoed horribly and the doors seemed to slam constantly, causing me to wake up several nights at around 2 or 3 AM.

After reading all the reviews here at Tripadvisor (good and bad) I really had no expectations. I was pleasantly surprised! GASP! Here is the low down: Prior to arrival I had called the Hotel Blake to get a reccomendation of a car service to pick me up at the airport. Alison at the front desk was professional and effecient. She took care of all my arrangements. Once I arrived at the Hotel Blake, there was no doorman. This didn't bother me, I am just relaying it to those who may care about such things. The front desk staff was friendly and checked me in quickly. My king room, #902, was lovely. The bed was comfortable. I loved the rainhead shower. Though, once you stepped away from the shower head you could get a little chilly. The bathroom did need a fan to help with the steam everywhere. There was no tv or phone in the bathroom as it states on the room description. No big deal there either. I encounter one problem in that my safe was locked closed when I arrived, I called the front desk and said I would need it fixed. I was told Maintenace was on their way up. I proceded to finish packing and still no maintenance. I had to meet some clients in the bar downstairs and could no longer wait so I called the front desk, told them to cancel the request for right now and that I'll call again in the morning. I put the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign out and headed to Custom House (more on Custom House in a moment). I returned to my room, a few hours later to find that the safe was open. Maintenance had still come up to my room and entered with the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on the door. This did not please me. I called the front desk, they rapidly took the complaint and apologized. I then received a call from the Manager apologizing for the mix up. I can understand why some folks have a problem with Housekeeping. I knew going in, after reading the reviews here, that I should call and make sure I have my room cleaned first thing in the morning. The first morning there I forgot to take my own advice! LOL I left my room around 9am and returned around 4pm only to find it still not cleaned. ARGH! Housekeeping then knocked on my door a moment later and then cleaned the room. The next morning I called and requested Housekeeping to come early, problem solved. The hotel was sold out but I never lacked for an elevator. Front desk always there, helpful and friendly. The doormen were there sporaticly. Custom House was very nice. I enjoyed cocktails there on two nights. Apetizers the first. There are some great dining options within walking distance of the hotel. Orange for breakfast, Hackney's for lunch or dinner. You'll see folks walking their dogs and some restaurant patios are dog friendly. I would stay at the Hotel Blake again.

Having stayed many times in Chicago, I wanted to try a different hotel (usually stay at the Sofitel or the W). Chicago was pretty booked that week so the reviews from the Blake were reassuring and wereally looked forward to the trip. Well, so much for truth in advertising. Where to begin? The service can't be faulted as there wasn't any. Their website talks of a choice of daily newspapers. Your choice is USA Today (or as we refer to it - McNews). But the best partt was, after seeing no paper outside our door, I went downstairs and was told I'd have to pick it up from the front desk. I requested that it be delivered and the dead-eyed receptionist just shrugged and walked away. The next day, a zombie who relieved the dead-eyed guard told me they could get me a newspaper if I wanted one. This was as I had one from the Starbucks across the street under my arm. I requested one for the next day. Never received one unsurprisingly. Three requests to have the room cleaned were met with a very kurt \"well the next shift will be there soon - there's a convention in town\". Every time the room was \"serviced\" there was of course something missing - no coffee or too few towels, etc. We alerted the rather annoyed front desk manager that there had been a room service tray in our hallway for over 8 hours and it was finally removed. 2 hours later. The room itself was not what we booked. When I booked it I expected one of the suites listed on their website. They have no suites I was told when I checked in. The rate was exorbitant for the size room we received. In response I got one of their patented shrugs. I asked to speak with the manager. She shrugged again and said she wasn't sure when he'd get there. \"He drops in\". The best part of this stay were the doormen who seemed genuinely embarrassed by the lack of services. That was when there was a doorman. It looks like they're cutting back on services as teice we arrived at night and there was no one to be found in the lobby. No doorman, no desk service. At one point we sat there just to see how long it would take to have someone show up. After a half an hour the novelty wore off. If anyone's in the market for some white vases, stop by the Blake after 10 and they're yours for the taking.

Well the Blake is in a bit remote part of town, not a lot to do in the immediate area. However, the theater district is just a few blocks away as in the Sears tower, and millenium park. Restuarants are a bit further-- at least the good ones:) Anyway, the staff at the Blake are very friendly and accomodating, but they do not have a traditonal concierge service. No one offered to book anything for us, but they did politely hand us a map and direct us where to go to book things ourselves. The lobby is georgeous!! The rooms are a bit small, but nicely decorated. However, the bathroom looked like a motel. The paint on the ceiling was peeling in big chips and just hanging there. The room needed a bit more attention to detail. Small stains on the carpet, the TV channel guide was completely wrong, and it had very few channels.

We had initially booked at the Blake back in January with some trepidation because the hotel was undergoing renovations and the reviews were not very good. However we got a good rate so stayed with it and are glad we did. The renovation is complete and it is generally quite pleasing. It is very much in the \"boutique hotel\" style, so if this isn't your style, look elsewhere. I suspect that the degree of satisfaction one has will depend on what room you are in. Initially we were given a room on the 7th floor facing the street. All good, except that it was so narrow that there was no room for a chest of drawers of any kind. Also, a small closet. Maybe not an issue if you are travelling alone, or just staying for one night and don't mind leaving your clothes in the suitcase. When we asked to be moved we were told that there are several different room configurations on each floor. However, the front desk staff were very happy to accomade our needs so we were moved to a bigger room, but on the back side of the building. Note that all of the odd number rooms are on the back side and look out at a brick wall that is only a very narrow street (more like a laneway) away, maybe 25 feet. Not an issue for us, since we don't stay in city hotels for the view. However what was a big issue is that the garbage bins for the hotel and other businesses are in this laneway, and the garbage trucks came by every night at about 4 AM. Ridiculous! We were awakened to the sound of these trucks compacting garbage in the middle of the night. Perhaps this would not be so noticable on a higher floor; we were on the 2nd. We again asked to be moved the next day but were told this was not possible because the hotel was sold out. Hmmmm. On a positive note, the room was clean and well appointed, the bed was fantastically comfortable, and the maid service great. However, the rooms do NOT have bathtubs, which would have been very nice for soaking in after running a marathon. But the shower is really big, and marble tiled. As noted in an earlier review, traffic noice could be an issue for some. Congress Parkway, at the north end of the hotel, is a VERY busy 8 lane street. Ideally one would want a big room on an upper floor, and at the south end of the building. Our friends had such a room, and if we had been there I would be giving The Blake a 5 star review. Didn't use the fitness centre or go to the restaurant, but both looked very nice and the restaurant was busy, a good sign. Other positives are the friendly and helpful staff and the location, which is 3 blocks from Michigan Avenue and Grant Park. Also the nearest CTA subway station (LaSalle) is only about a 3 minute walk. This is the Blue line, which is the train that goes to O'Hare Airport. The Plymouth Restaurant, which is about a 5 minute walk, serves \"casual American\", including breakfast and has a sports bar downstairs, as well as a rooftop bar (not that it was open in late October). Overall, I would consider staying at the Blake again, but given that the rates have increased (depending on when you stay), the value for money quotient has gone down.", "Date": "October 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Livonia, MI", "Title": "\u201cThe Hotel Blake: A \"Must Stay\"\u201d", "Author": "rebecca1027", "ReviewID": "UR6016108", "Content": "STAY AT THE HOTEL BLAKE!! This was my husband and my second trip to Chicago. During our first visit, we stayed at the \"renowned\" (says who?) Whitehall Hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6which totally sucked!!! Our experience at the Whitehall was so bad we were terrified that any hotel that received fewer than four stars had to be unbearable. However, our stay at The Hotel Blake proved the star-system wrong. To be honest, we were a little apprehensive about staying at the Blake after reading some of the poor reviews. Plus, the low price and the name (perhaps a knock-off of \"The Drake Hotel\"?) made us wonder what kind of bad imposter The Hotel Blake might be. We worried for nothing though--everything was perfect! For starters, we couldn't have asked for a better location. The Blake was a few blocks from the Theater District, a short walk to the Chicago Institute of Arts, a $4 cab ride from the train station and within walking distance of tons of shopping, restaurants, etc. The hotel was immaculate too (trust me\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I'm extremely picky). From the modern, stylish d\u00c3\u00a9cor, to the outstanding staff and service, everything about the Blake was top-notch. Oh\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and the shower is fit for a queen (or king)\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and big enough to fit both! However, as some of the other reviews mentioned, the Blake did not have flat panel TVs. Where they got that idea, I have no clue\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but who goes to Chicago to watch TV anyway? We weren't disappointed. Without a doubt, we'll be staying at the Blake again and we highly recommend you do the same. PS: After making your reservations on hotels.com or another travel website, be sure to call the hotel to confirm your reservations, bed-size, etc. (Tip: While you have them on the phone, ask for the biggest/nicest room too.) If you don't do this (like one guest we encountered as we were checking out), there's a chance the Blake will not be able to accommodate your initial reservation, since reservations made online don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always reflect hotel availability.

I was in town on business and needed to be in this area. The hotel itself is obviously very old which can play either way for people. I didn't mind the age, it made it kind of chic really. Our room was on the 7th floor and wasn't too bad. There were a few spots where the wall paper was peeling off the wall near the floor, but hey, it's just cosmetics. The room was very clean. I have no complaints about that. The marble floors in the bathroom were a little dangerous when wet so be VERY careful. The room was quite large with high ceilings and the street facing wall was all windows. This had it's ups and downs. The draft off the glass was quite chilly. I know this is just the nature of big old buildings with lots of glass.....drafty. The biggest complaint I had was the noise off of the street. You are directly above Dearborn and Congress which can be quite busy at all hours. I'm certain you'd suffer this in most locations in the city, but I have stayed at other downtown locations in Chicago right on Michigan and did not experience the street noise I experienced at Hotel Blake. The next little issue was with the valet parking. I realize that there aren't a lot of options to park downtown so I can't complain about the $36/day valet parking charge. I would complain, however, about the fact that the first night we arrived they never parked the car, but left it on the curb all night in front of the hotel and tried to charge us the $36 anyway........ The other minor complaint would be the funky smell in the hallway. Our room didn't smell, but the hallway was very musty and had almost a leaking \"propane\" sort of smell. The staff was friendly and accomodating....no issues there. In summary, if you have to stay in the financial district, you could stay here without suffering too badly, but it wouldn't be my first choice. I would probably stay here again in a pinch, but not really by choice. One thing I will say, is if you do stay here, be sure to eat at Edwardo's across the street. EXCELLENT pizza and great service.

I heard there were some kinks initally but that they had been worked out. Unfortunately, this was not true and we were very disappointed in the lack of customer service and attention to detail that most boutique hotels, especially those in the Preferred Boutique group, usually have. First, what you might read about this \"luxury boutique hotel\" on Expedia and it's Web site is false advertising. While the hotel looks nice from the outside and is located in a great area, there are none of the luxuries they promote (i.e., plama screen TVs, TVs in bathroom, robes, Molton Brown products, morning paper etc.). And, the customer service was awful - they made us feel like we were constantly putting them out any time we asked for something. When we arrived, our rooms were very warm as the air conditioning wasn't working and the windows did not open. The staff offered to provide us with another room but it was the same situation. They did not have fans or anything - basically they told us to tough it out. Also, I tried to talk with the manager several times during our stay but he was never on duty. I could go on and on...So, if you are looking for a luxury boutique hotel get away spend a little extra and stay at The James or W on Lakeshore as Hotel Blake still needs A LOT of work and some customer service training.", "Date": "September 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago", "Title": "\u201cGreat Way to Celebrate Anniversary\u201d", "Author": "veronica22", "ReviewID": "UR5790063", "Content": "My husband and I celebrated our anniversary in the city and the location was great! close to michigan ave shopping. the rooms were spotless and the amenities were fabulous.
