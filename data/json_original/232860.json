It was booked several months before and I was aware of some of the reviews. Whoever grades the hotels in Rome have got this one wrong. It is by no means a four star. Our room, on the first floor overlooking the main street was generally small and the bathroom tiny. The bathroom was moderately clean although the shower tiles could have done with a spray of disinfectant. The furniture / wardrobe was old and outdated. There was mould/mildew on the ceiling above the door as you walked in. Generally, the room was in need of a refurb. The reception area however was done very smart with a sense of \"olde worlde\" about it. Breakfast was average - usual continental style and nothing to write home about although did fill a gap. Some of the staff on reception could do with a course in customer relations. Perhaps a smile every now and again and engage the customer in conversation about their trip wouldn't have gone a miss. The roof top terrace was good. There was plenty of seating up there and provided an escape for an hour to sit and relax, watching the hustle and bustle of the streets below. The bonus side of this hotel is its location. It is situated just a two minute walk away from the central train station and bus / tram terminus. This was extremely useful to us as we had bought a Roma Card and used public transport a lot. As they say, all roads lead to Rome, in our case, all buses and trams led to within 2 minutes of our hotel. The area that the hotel is situated in was also quite pleasant. There are ample cafes/bars/restaurants very close by and some lovely buildings / architecture to explore just moments away. We paid 313 Euros for our three night stay here, and then there was an extra 18 Euros on top for the \"tourist tax\". Being classed as a 4 star hotel, the tax meant we paid 3 Euros each a night. If this was a 3 start hotel it would have been 2 Euros each a night. All in all, the hotel experience didn't ruin our holiday, but when you stay at what is advertised as a 4* hotel, you would expect better. If I had to do it again, I wouldn't stay here, but would go to either a 3* hotel whose prices reflect it, or pay a little more for a genuine 4*.", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ry, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cNot a four star hotel\u201d", "Author": "Morten016", "ReviewID": "UR117345932", "Content": "The Hotel Torino has a fine reception with english speaking staff, that is manned 24 hrs. And the roof terrase is nice, eventhough the nice furniture and flowers from the pictures has been replaced with somewhat more basic furniture of metal. That is positive. Also the location is fine, with 5 min to the trainstation and metro, or if you like to walk, about 15 mins to Colosseum and 20 min to the historical centre. But besides that, the hotel should not be rated a four star hotel. The rooms are clean, but old and especially the bathroom is not acceptable for a hotel with four stars. Using the shower with the old fixed showerhead mounted to the wall, leaves the floor a mess. And I am sorry to say this, but we had to use the plastic wastebin to flush the toilet, because the water pressure just was not nearly enough. The breakfast was acceptable, but only with bake-off bread and no bacon/eggs or similar. Again - that is okay, just not what you expect from a four star hotel. And the bathroom in the room - there is just no excuse but that it must be a deliberate choise not to fix them.

The hotel is air conditioned, with relatively small rooms but good facilities. One night our toilet ran all night, but it was fixed the next day. The bathroom was fine, the bed was comfortable, we had free wifi, and the staff were very helpful in getting us to the contemporary museums we wanted to see. In fact we were impressed at how convenient transportation to the relatively distant MAXXI and MACRO was. Although the area is bustling, the room was very quiet. Breakfast is on the 7th floor, with a roof terrace option that we enjoyed quite a lot. It has some high flying pigeons that can be a nuisance, but all in all was very pleasant. My only complaint there was the machine that made sweet capuccino or small portions of cafe macchiato. Our other hotels provided real capuccino. The Hotel Torino led me to think that the train station area in Rome may be a really good place to stay; I've always stayed near the Spanish Steps or Piazza Navona before.

The suite consisted of one large bedroom with twin beds, and a smaller separate but more than adequately sized room containing a double metal action sofa bed, dressing table, wardrobe and air conditioning. This room could have easily slept two adults if necessary which would have meant that four people could have shared the suite. There was also a large bathroom which was immaculately clean and the bedlinen was changed once while we were there, even though we only stayed three nights. Breakfast on the terrace was a pleasant start to the day and consisted of the usual fruit juices, cereals, cold meat and cheeses, yoghurts, croissants, breads and jams. We found all staff pleasant and very helpful at all times and the hotel although on a busy street, was quiet at night. This ensured that we had a peaceful night's sleep. It is very close to the Termini Station which was great if you wanted to catch the Metro or a bus and it was also very close to major tourist sites. There were plenty of good restaurants all sensibly priced in the immediate area or within a short walking distance and we did not feel threatened at all walking about in this area at night. We only stayed for three nights and did not manage to fit in all of our planned sightseeing and so we will be returning to Rome again in the near future. We will most certainly stay in this hotel again and would recommend it to other people.", "Date": "October 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dunfermline, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA Nice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Fife_Flyer", "ReviewID": "UR3894650", "Content": "On arrival we were met by a friendly member of staff who was polite, efficient and took the time to show us where the various sites were on the map.

The furnishings of the room were good, although our bed had a large lump in the middle as if two rather large people had been sleeping in our bed before us!

I would rate this hotel as a 3 star. Our group had 2 rooms. One on the 2nd floor and one on the 6th floor. Both were of a good size though I would say that the furnishings are a little tired. The aircon was a boon as the temps in Rome were in the mid 30's. The only, small, criticism I have is that the shower cubicle was quite narrow. Being over 6ft tall and 19 stone I had to keep movement to a minimum otherwise I received a burst of very hot or very cold water depending on which way I knocked the shower control. Breakfast was included in our deal and I think it is probably the best spread that I have seen in a continental hotel. It was a buffet of meats (3/4 varieties), cheeses (3 choices), pastries (2/3 choices), fresh fruit, fruit juices and cereals. For 2 morning we had a young blonde waitress who provided coffee as soon as we arrived, also arranged the breakfast table so that we could all eat together. On the 3rd morning there was a different waitress. She was indifferent to our arrival. I had to go an ask for coffee and she made no attempt to arrange the table. I had to go and collect extra cutlery etc. myself. No big deal but not what we had come to expect based on previous experience. Hotel staff in general were very helpful and friendly especially on the front desk. They have a secure room to stow your suitcases in on departure day, ours wasn't until 17:30. The staff declined a tip when getting our luggage down to the foyer. The important point about this hotel is its position....literally 5 mins walk from Romes Termini railway station, bus terminus and Metro. Only 15mins amble from the Colloseum and Forum.

The room we got was a modest size with all promised amenities: large bed, TV, bathroom, air con, small fridge. The air con was absolutely essential as the temperatures in Rome soared to 35 C those days! It was one of those older centralised air cons making very audible humming noise when it works. But it's hard to complain as it was quite efficient keeping us cool (even too cool sometimes!) day and night. An obvious downside, in my opinion, was a too small shower cabin with no hard walls that was separated from the rest of the bathroom only by a thin curtain. As a result, the water was all over the place when we were taking shower and there was hardly any room to move inside the shower cabin. But that was just a minor negative thing that in no way spolit our stay. The hotel staff was relatively friendly and helpful if you compare them with generally mediocre level of service in Italy. People at the reception spoke some English that was good enough to get by. There is a number of small restaurants nearby to have lunch or dinner. They are not very high quality but quite affordable and should do if you don't expect a fancy night out. When booking the trip, we were offered a hotel breakfast option for extra c. $8 per night (this covers both of us). We took this option and never regretted about it. The breakfast area is on the roof terrace with all usual stuff available: cold meats, bread, fruit, juices, cereal, coffee/tea, etc. The selection of food was the same every day but if you don't stay there for longer than 2-3 days, you're not going to get sick of it. Having a quick good breakfast for the very reasonable money saves you valuable time in the morning. Overall, the stay at Torino was fairly comfortable and pleasant. The hotel offered us a good refuge after long hot days in town.
