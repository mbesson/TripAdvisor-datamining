First, it was nicer than I expected (first got there and expected a crappy motel, from the looks on the outside), but it was a lot nicer in the rooms (as it should because i paid 99 bucks for the night). The rooms were clean, the beds were comfy, and it was quiet. The staff was super nice and we even had housekeeping knock on our door even though we were going to be checking out at noon. Very convenient location, close to a lot of things and the free shuttle to sea world and back was awesome! saved a lot on parking, and even left our car at the hotel to go to sea world after we checked out! parking at the hotel was free, which was nice! no free breakfast tho, so we had to go to the little restaurant they have, Bunz, which wasn't bad. I asked for a king bed and i was given 2 queens, but it was no problem.

It had good and bad. The check-in process was a little slow but they were polite and apologetic for the delays. They also apologized for the tree not being fully decorated but it smelled wonderful in the lobby. Rec'd an upper level floor towards the back of the property as requested. The room is nothing spectacular. Two beds, tv, mini-fridge and a micro, your standard things. The odd thing that I didn't like was the bathroom. It was small but what was worse was the towel rack was in the tub enclosure opposite the shower head. While things didn't get wet it is just awkward showering with that in there. Outside of the enclosure there were plenty of spaces where this would have seemed to have make more sense but I am not a room designer so maybe it holds some purpose. The pool area is all the way at the back of the property so you don't hear any noise from screaming kids. PLUS!! It is surrounded by trees and even though you can hear the cars whizzing by behind them as long as you don't envision them crashing through the trees you will find yourself relaxing. The hot tub was a nice distance from the pool so that it offered privacy but yet enough of a view to still see your kids swimming. A bathroom complete with changing area and rinse off area proved beneficial in the slightly chilly December weather. Pool area was clean and well maintained. The laundry room is huge! Yes, I am one of those stange ones who does laundry on trips. I just can't stand to come home with dirty clothes. Nice comfortable chairs and lots of space to fold. There is a tv in the room so you can watch while you wait. The PamPam Grill was sufficient. A little pricey but equal in price to the quality and quantity of food. Overall, a pleasent stay. Extra touches of pool towels in the room and the staff arranging the kids stuffed animals after makind the bed were very appreciated.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane", "Title": "\u201cA Perfect Introduction to The USA, and San Diego\u201d", "Author": "Neata_Skeeter", "ReviewID": "UR126571159", "Content": "This was the first place we stayed on our recent trip to the States, and we loved every minute in San Diego.

It was by no means terrible or bad, but average. The room was nice and I was pretty happy with the layout of the restroom. The room also came with a fridge which was extremely convenient since we had a lot of food stored in an ice chest from the day we spent at Sea World. Upon reading reviews I was informed to ask for a room in the back, which I did. I can't compare it to the rooms in the other buildings, but I did like being in the back near the pool as it felt a bit more private, almost like an apartment complex. I especially liked being able to use the covered parking. Disappointment: One thing I had been especially looking forward to was breakfast, which was supposed to be provided in the pool area, but when we asked the woman at the front desk she had said that was no longer available. It was not a big deal, but I really had my mind set on some muffins or orange juice. Tip: Being that I was sharing a room with the family we went to Sea World with, we only received one parking pass. If you want another parking pass, the hotel requires you to pay an amount which I can't remember. Rather then doing that, I just opened the lid of a trash can and found a parking pass that someone had thrown away. Call it what you will, but I didn't want to spend anymore money here. Overall: As I had mentioned and there was nothing to blow me away. I believe though that I extremely overpaid for this room though. My amount was $150.98 when the room was anywhere between a $50-75/night room. It's just my opinion. Would I stay here again: No, not at the price listed above.

The motel itself is overall disappointing (my room was way in the back of a parking lot- and in all honesty I didn't feel tremendously safe hiking over there at night)- the carpet/tv etc was \"fine\"- and I wasn't really expecting much. This review however is because this was literally the WORST customer service I've ever experienced. I was traveling for an interview at UCSD- and they have a shuttle that goes up the hill. When I asked the front desk about it- they replied that I could just call 15 minutes before and that would be adequate. I called them at 7am on a Saturday (presumably a time when the shuttle wasn't probably too busy)- it was POURING rain actually- and I just called to \"inquire\" if there were anyway that the shuttle could come around to the back- about 100 feet- but given my suit + suitcase etc it would have made a big difference given the rain. The first guy told me he would check and I should call back in 5 minutes. When I called back- the lady on the phone told me \"she didn't think it could work\"- but when prompted she agreed to just ask- because it was POURING- and I don't see how it made much difference at all for the shuttle driver (literally on the way out of the parking lot)-- especially given that they had said I was the only passenger so far. Then some other lady- named \"Joy\" came on the phone and asked \"what my problem was\" -- and that now the shuttle had other people to take and it needed to leave immediately. I replied that I would run over there that second- and although she said \"ok\"- when I got there (soaking wet)- the shuttle had just left. Furthermore Joy and the other lady told me to be \"patient\" while I was waiting there soaking wet for a shuttle I had called about 30 minutes before. Like I said- I've never been motivated to write a complaint- I think it's ok to ask for something politely that would make a big difference in pouring rain- but I didn't act insulting about the question-- and I felt they went out of their way to be difficult and insulting. Another person interviewing with me had a similiar experience with them trying to arrange the shuttle. Anyway- they are grouped with at least 10 other cheap hotels- their price I'm sure is not so much cheaper to warrant this degree of poor service. I would definitely look at any of the other motels in the vicinity- because although you might not expect much from a motel like this-- it's reasonable to expect them to at least try to be nice (or have some BASIC service skills).", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guildford,Surrey", "Title": "\u201cOnly OK...\u201d", "Author": "KarenBeachcomber", "ReviewID": "UR120452299", "Content": "Stayed here in August with my family for a couple of nights.

To be fair, the bathroom was OK. We almost paid extra for a rollaway bed for my son, but during our stay I caught sight of these beds, which were(for some unknown reason) being stored alongside the bins. The mattresses were stained and dirty and I would certainly not have let my son sleep on it! The location would have been fine if you had a car, but we had just flown in and were flying on elsewhere so did not have one. The shuttle bus would have been good but only if you tipped the driver very generously. Our driver was very nice on the way from the airport and told us his colleague would drop us off downtown the next day so we could explore. However, when we tried to arrange this, the colleague was really rude and said said he was busy and made us feel ridiculous for mentioning it. He eventually got us a taxi, but it is funny, it seemed to be driven by a friend of his and the fare was way more than we paid when we got our own taxi on the way back.

A shuttle did indeed come to pick us up eventually however I had to call them...they do not drop by automatically, say on the hour or half hour. Secondly they only willingly go to destinations of their choosing ie. SeaWorld, the Zoo, Lego Land and a couple of other places I wasn't interested in. We had hoped to get a ride to Balboa Park but reception made it seem like this would be a terribly arduous task for the driver even though he was free at the time. The room itself was much smaller than anticipated with a closet-like bathroom (sink outside right next to the microwave!?). I for one do not enjoy having to leave the washroom with dirty hands in order to wash up outside. Also, the proximity of the washroom to the \"kitchen\" area seemed slightly unhygienic to me. Beware of the paper thin walls as well--if you have noisy neighbours it might make it difficult to sleep in peace. We also were unable to make use of the outdoor pool as it was quite chilly outside and it is in the shade. It is also quite small. I wasn't crazy about the fact that housekeeping didn't replenish things like sugar, stir stix, cream, etc. on a regular basis. Also, despite a written request to please provide decaf coffee instead of regular we kept getting the wrong kind. Tea was available on request only and didn't come in the room. This was bothersome. Internet access is listed as part of the property amenities but there is only one public computer and usage is limited to 15 minutes a go. Suffice it to say we barely got to use it at all. I recommend travelling with a laptop if you have one as there is free Wifi (apparently). On the plus side, the hotel is ideally located if you are open to taking public transit, with a bus stop right outside taking you to Fashion Valley mall or, in the other direction, downtown.", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Culver City, CA", "Title": "\u201cDefinitely for families\u201d", "Author": "Sharkitten", "ReviewID": "UR119975107", "Content": "We stayed here because of their special rate and after our first night, realized that this is more of a family establishment than a weekend childless getaway.

The Good: The hotel was easy to find. Located on a strip with tons of other hotels right off the highway. The staff was very courteous and friendly. The room was clean and comfortable. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and conducive to sleep. Microwave and small refrigerator. The Bad: The hotel is right on the highway. We were issues a room on the second floor, closest to the road, which meant closest to the highway. On the first night I thought a Police car was going to come through the door into the room . The highway noise is very loud. I mean, very. I suppose if you were in the back of the complex, or even on the side away from the oncoming traffic it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be so bad, maybe not even noticeable. In defense of the hotel, our room and the room above it were probably the worst for noise so it may not be fair to judge the whole hotel this way. Speaking of noise, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what this hotel was constructed from. I bet it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t originally a hotel. I say this because of the squeaky floors. I could hear every step the family above us made as they traversed the hotel room continuously. Walking with their heavy steps, pounding across the floor, boom, boom, boom, squeeeeek, thud. It was like a bad apartment building. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed in a lot of hotels, and I never remember hearing anyone above. So, ask for a room on the top floor if this kind of thing bothers you. Thank goodness I sleep like the dead. Parking. We arrived late on the first night and found the last parking space in the hotel complex. I know it was the last space for sure because we drove through the whole complex. While we were always able to find a space, it was tight and not always near our room. On another note, I think there is a conspiracy in southern California to weed out large cars through the application of small parking spaces. We were given a luxury car at the car rental as they were out of what we purchased. So we got a big car. Good luck in those tiny parking spaces. You may fit into the space but have to exit your vehicle through the trunk and hope you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t run into whoever you parked next to. No breakfast. Some of the reviews mentioned a continental breakfast and I could have sworn I read something on a website about a breakfast, but when I inquired about its location with the front desk, an eyebrow went up along with that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153what are you talking about look?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So, no breakfast, but there was coffee in the lobby as well as a coffee maker in the room.

Our sheets had cigarette burn holes on one side. Bathroom sink did not drain well and there was scum and remnants of hair shavings in it. It was chilly at night, but we had to turn off the heating unit immediately after turning it on because it emitted a horrible smell. Most frustrating was the door to the toilet/tub area (the sink is in the room outside the door). It was a pocket type door that recedes into the wall.

It had been closed completely and the indentation for pulling it open was so shallow that I could not get a good grip to open it. I had to awaken my husband and he could not get it open either until he used a bent hangar to pry it open. After that we always left the door slightly ajar and never completely closed it. We tried breakfast at Pam Pam's one day and ended up walking out when no one waited on us. We walked to the left past the Courtyard and Vagabond and discovered a gem of a restaurant called Valley Kitchen. It was absolutely wonderful --- highly recommend. Great prices, service and quiet atmosphere. We ate there every day for breakfast. Pros: Free parking! Free internet service worked pretty well, a little slower in the evening but otherwise it was speedy. The bed was very comfortable. They have shuttle service, although we did not use it. All in all the price was right and we were out most of the day until late evening. But next time we will stay in a \"hotel\" and in a different place than Hotel Circle. Its not a very walkable location, although we were able to walk to the Valley Kitchen for breakfast, and found that we could have even walked to Fashion Valley Mall on the other side of Hotel Circle by walking under the overpass. But we wished we had stayed downtown or in an area where we could have come out of the hotel and safely walked to a number of restaurants and shops.", "Date": "February 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cSimple and affordable.\u201d", "Author": "602Traveler", "ReviewID": "UR96489391", "Content": "Stayed here with my wife for two nights.

Booked here due to the above-average reviews on Trip Advisor and the rate with the AAA discount was probably the best I could find booking just six days away from arrival date. Also, this property doesn't show up on any of the bedbug report websites, which was another big reason for booking. Booked directly through the hotel toll-free line to ensure we got the AAA rate (though the ihotelier.com booking engine showed a slightly cheaper rate, I opted to stay with the res I called to make; I'm a big believer in booking directly w/ a property vs. relying on a third-party system or agency website). We arrived slightly after 6 pm to check in; front desk clerk was polite and efficient. Stayed in 2 rooms on third level of the next-to-last building (note: the last building \"the Sunset Wing\" has enclosed hallways, which is probably why the management can call this a \"hotel\" when the majority of the rooms are clearly motel-style and open up to the outside). There are elevators in each building, but they are not large -- if you need to ride up in a wheelchair you might want to call to verify you'll be able to fit in the lift. A computer in the lobby for internet access is available for checking in for flights or looking up local restaurants or attraction info. Bedding linens and bath towels were all clean; carpet looks recently installed -- no stains or bad odors. Standard room has mini-fridge, microwave, coffee maker, iron and ironing board. Doors had working locks and felt safe (yes, there was a _tiny_ gap at the bottom of door, but I'd attribute this to the building settling over the years - and the door frames followed suit). The couch in the room was the only sore spot for us: there were clearly white stains on it and it was very old and faded -- management should swap these out or just get rid of them altogether. Disgusting -- we laid towels down on this just in case. We ordered a grilled cheese sandwich for our son and a bottle of wine from Pam Pam to accompany the pizza we ordered from one of the chain pizzerias -- they delivered without issue right to our door. Parking is still free. Bed was very comfy and at night the room was quiet aside from room AC we turned on or bathroom flushing. Rude neighbors insisted on allowing their door next to ours slam shut in the morning despite the fact that we had our doorknob \"quiet please\" sign out, but that's not the property management's issue. We didn't try the pool - no time for that. Didn't bring laptop computer, so can't speak to how good the wifi coverage is, but used my AT&T Blackberry for looking up info -- good strong signal coverage for AT&T wireless users. For breakfast recommend Ricky's Restaurant on Hotel Cir. South nearby -- very good! Overall, drove away the next morning thinking we got great value for the price we paid. I'd come back and recommend to travelers on a budget, but there's another major property in Hotel Circle area I want to try also that is suppose to have had major makeover on their rooms recently. My one last comment to management: consider moving the cigarette butt receptacles AWAY from the elevators: non-smokers do NOT want to smell cigarette smoke as they exit the elevator; consider putting these at the end of each building (maybe one day San Diego will follow Santa Monica and Culver City's examples and ban cigarette smoking in public places altogether).", "Date": "January 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winston Salem, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cInexpensive, better than expected, but rough around edges\u201d", "Author": "YepBeenThere", "ReviewID": "UR94696741", "Content": "I stayed here as a place to sleep for an early flight out of San Diego airport the next day.

We were on the second floor so we weren't close too the parking noise but we did hear our upstairs neighbors walking. I felt bad for the neighbors below as we traveled with our 3 children so having them walk quietly was a challenge. We got a 2 queen room with a kitchenette. The beds were comfortable, and the small kitchen area was appreciated. The kitchen had a small 2 burner stove, with a mini fridge and small mircrowave. It was nice to have the silverware and dishes provided as well. Just wish they had provided more than just 3 of each with a family of 5. We had to have the kids eat first, then dish ourselves up. But we managed. The pool was nice and we did take advantage of that during our trip. The kids really enjoyed going during the weekend to attend the pool side movie they played. My only compliant is I wish they played the movie a little earlier. It didnt start till 830pm so wasn't over until close to 10pm. My younger two passed out both nights around 9pm so it wasn't worth it for them. And I have to agree, the resturaunt was not very good at all. We went because kids eat free so thought we would give it a try. The food wasn't very good and when we got our bill, were upset to find out that the Happy Hour specials were not combinable with the Kids Eat Free specials. The waiter or the flyer for the Happy Hour specials never mentioned this so we ended up paying full price instead. I don't know if I would stay at this hotel again.

I have had my reservations since February and since that time; I have been asking questions making sure that I made the right choice in staying here instead of the Host hotel. My judgment has proven me wrong. My stay started on June 21. When I checked in at 1130pm, I advised that I would need the shuttle service tomorrow. One of my main questions that I continued to ask before my stay was questions about the shuttle. Even the week before we came, I received an email advising me about the shuttle and I emailed back asking if I needed to make reservations before my arrival. Ingrid, responded no do not worry about it you can do it when you arrive. Okay no problem. Now when I tell the agent I needed the shuttle at 145 and 730 he states, it only runs every two hours and there is no room on the 730. Never once was I told that the shuttle runs on certain hours and I was told not to worry about shuttle reservations. He further proceeded to tell me I could stand on the shuttle. I have two children with me that are under 10 years old. How safe would it be for them to stand? We took our chances and caught the 730 without standing. However, the driver was almost 15 minutes late! If we were 15 minutes, late the shuttle would have left without us. The room. That is a sad model of your hotel. We first were in 351 but after I complained, we moved to 130. The problems with 351. The bathroom door would not open or shut. I finally had enough when my 7 year old was stuck in the bathroom. The crack under the door was so large I could see outside lights through the bottom of the door. My kids had a great time slipping papers back in forth underneath the door. Same problem with 130.The toilet constantly ran. I advised the agent of these issues and he stated he would put in a work request. The next day we were gone from appx 930 to 630 and the repairs were not completed. After that, I requested a room change and moved to 130. In that room, the issues were the door and the mold in the shower. By that time I was so frustrated I just gave up. At the restaurant, I was charged for my children every breakfast that we ate there. According to the email that I received, it states Kids Eat Free at Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner at the Pam Pam Caf\u00c3\u00a9 and Grill! Children 12 and under receive one free kid's meal from the Children's Menu with each adult entr\u00c3\u00a9e and beverage purchased. Why was I charged? Isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that false advertising? On my departure, my flight had changed and I spoke with the agent to change the shuttle. I told her that I needed to be at the airport by 7:10 and I knew the shuttle only ran every 2 hours but if it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have anyone else at 6 or 8 could they possibly take me. I was told no. No explanation straight out no. Fine I reserved a taxi and that was that. The next morning on my check out, I saw the shuttle sitting there even thought I was told they could not make an exception for me. My taxi arrived and off I went. I had friends still at the hotel and I called them at 8:00am and asked them to go see if the shuttle was still there and it was. Instead of offering a courtesy since I had prior issues with my stay, I had to spend $ 25.00 on a ride to the airport that should have been free. Overall, my stay was one of the worst that I have ever experienced. With my daughter on gymnastics, we stay at numerous ones throughout the year and if I ever end up back in San Diego, I will make sure to avoid this hotel at all costs. I truly believe my entire stay should be refunded because of this experience. They responded with a run of the mill answer and never reimbursed me even though I had written proof.

We came to enjoy 8 days of vacation time after a busy seminar in Los Angeles. Here are the GOODS: The location is close to the main highway and good shopping sites such as Fashion Valley Mall and Mission Valley Mall (which I HIGHLY recommend for any fashionista who wants amazing deals...go to Loehman's outlet and Nordstrom's Off the Rack....prepare to spend a lot of money but on dirt cheap deals!). Parking is quite ample and FREE with a pass given by the hotel. There are MANY rooms and different wings to the hotel. This hotel is one of the few that offers a kitchenette which includes 2 hot burners, a good size fridge and 2 sinks...along with pots, pans, dishes and cutlery. They also provide soap but no sponge! The whirlpool is decent. NOT SO GOOD: There are elevators located at the far end of each building...which can be a walk away if you have a lot of suitcases. The rooms are very basic with extremely old furnishings and beds that are hard as rocks. Rooms with kitchenettes ONLY come with 2 queen beds which was a waste of space as it was just for my husband and myself. Both beds were equally terrible. Pillows were so old that you could literally roll them up in a small ball. The hotel advertises a heated pool and free internet...the pool was NOT heated-rather cold but your body temperature adjusted. One family had purposely booked the Days Hotel because of their \"heated pool\" but were disappointed. Even though it is quite sunny in San Diego, the initial walk in to the water is VERY cold. The pool is small but situated away from the hotels in a fenced area with excellent landscaping. Be prepared to have many kids jumping in the pool and splashing you in the face...there is a NO DIVING rule but the kids don't care and dive in anyways...constantly. The internet is free...which was the main reason we picked this hotel-however, from the get go our connection was terrible. We would either have to stand in the bathroom, in the tub to get a signal, or go outside our door...very inconvenient. The front desk were helpful in trying to get us connected with IT support...and offered us a chance to move rooms which was nice. We didn't want to haul around all of our stuff and chose to stay there. So be prepared that your internet connection is below par. The closet was TINY. Overall, this hotel is quite old even though it boasts itself as being \"the best Days hotel in San Diego\" which is probably untrue. The staff is quite nice and the location is EXCELLENT-very close to Sea World and always within 15 minutes of other hot spot areas. We also got an excellent deal through priceline where we only paid $69 a night for a kitchenette room...the normal price through other services was $109 a night which I would classify as a bit too extreme for an old style, very plain hotel. I wouldn't pay more than $75 a night for this place. If you want something cheap and don't care about the hard beds, small and old rooms (the bathroom always smelled like urine), and don't use internet...this hotel is good for you. In future, I may come back but not to spend more than a few days here. At least we had a cheaper price and the free parking/sub par internet to tide us over. There are many other hotels right near by, it would make sense to keep an eye out.

I was taking an online class that extended through our stay and needed to submit daily assignments, as well as take a 2-hour exam one of the days. The connection was always stable, as well as the speed, even during peak traffic times such as the evening.

We chose Days Hotel because it offered the best value for the nightly rate. First things first: If you are looking for a luxury room with a luxury price, look elsewhere. There are several luxury hotels and resorts nearby where the room rate will be much higher and you will pay even more for parking and Internet access. The Days Hotel is conveniently located--it is minutes away from downtown San Diego, Old Town San Diego, Sea World, the zoo, Balboa Park, Belmont Park, and other local attractions. It is located right beside busy Interstate 8; however, we had a room near the front of the building and did not notice any highway noise. The Days Hotel is an older hotel but the rooms have been renovated. We opted for the kitchenette room. The room was a standard (not oversized) two-bed hotel room with a small self-contained stainless steel cooking unit in the dressing area. The cooking unit has a sink, a two element electric cooktop, and a medium-sized dorm refrigerator. There was a microwave oven on the dressing area countertop. Above the kitchenette unit was a cabinet with a skillet, large saucepan, plates, cups, and silverware. The kitchenette was conveniently stocked with dish detergent, a sealed sponge, a dish cloth, and a dish towel. The kitchenette seemed like a good idea when we booked the room; however, we ended up only using the microwave and refrigerator. With two adults, two children, and our luggage in the room, space was rather tight and the room just wasn't big enough to allow us to have a serious meal. If a microwave and refrigerator are included in a standard room, we would skip the kitchenette option if we stay there again. The room itself felt very clean, although the carpet (particularly near the door) could certainly use a deep cleaning. The sheer curtains were very dirty where the air from the air conditioning unit blew on them. The bathroom and dressing area seemed very clean. The shower surround, bathroom floor, and dressing area floor had been updated with modern tile and they were spotless. However, the pocket door between the bathroom and dressing area seemed ancient and it did not operate smoothly. The beds were clean and comfortable--we especially appreciated the way they sandwich the blanket between two sheets. Overall, we didn't have any significant concerns about cleanliness. My wife is rather sensitive to cleanliness and she felt our room was quite acceptable. The hotel has a very nice heated pool and a hot tub at the back of the property. Our children were quite pleased with the pool, even though it was too cold for my wife and me to venture in. We were staying at the hotel at an extremely busy time and the (free) parking lot can get full. If you are renting a car, you might want to avoid the giant SUV or Crown Victoria. Some previous reviewers had mentioned this and it proved to be very accurate. Also remember that you can only park one car at the hotel--this was not a problem for us. Regarding the service, we did not experience any of the unfriendliness reported in some of the reviews. The maintenance staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The friendliness of the front desk staff was about average. One of the nicest things about this hotel is their shuttle service to major points of interest, including Sea World, the zoo, and other attractions. You MUST sign up for the shuttle and space is limited, so check their schedule and sign up early. Even though some reviewers have criticized the shuttle service because of the need to sign up early, it still seemed like a valuable benefit to us. You can also conveniently purchase tickets to attractions at the front desk; however, we were able to beat their prices by using our AAA discount or Internet coupons. Be sure to do your research before you leave home. Overall, we were happy with our stay at Days Hotel. Some of our friends stayed at a nearby resort at twice the nightly rate (plus optional parking and Internet). They saw our room and said their room was not significantly better. The resort had no shuttle service whatsoever and their front desk recommended calling a cab or taking mass transit. We had originally considered staying at the resort and felt quite vindicated having chosen Days Hotel.", "Date": "June 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buckeye, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cBeds are surprisingly comfy\u201d", "Author": "jeromepablo", "ReviewID": "UR68601479", "Content": "I was reluctant to use this hotel after reading some of the reviews but took my chances, I am glad I did, it didn't smell, the beds were comfy and the staff was friendly and informative.

The only real negative thing I have to say is about the PAM PAM cafe, we had breakfast there our first morning, what a mistake. The food was horrible and the staff was RUDE. Days Hotel should be ashamed of this place. We got a buy one adult breakfast and get the kids free deal through the internet booking process as did several other guests. Pam Pam staff did not honer the deal, they told other patrons that they were misinformed by the hotel.

I booked the upgraded, business class room with two queen beds for our family of five (two adults and three kids ages 5-9). This room is in the hotel's newest remodeled building and is the only building that opens to an interior corridor. All the other buildings open to an outside corridor. This building is also closest to the pool area, and comes with covered parking. The business rooms include snacks which I thought would come in handy with three kids. We did not get what we expected. First of all, the room was so small, there was no way a family of five could stay in this room. We were on top of each other the whole time. We always travel with an air mattress in case we run into situations like this, and it was good we had it. We had to rearrange furniture to fit the air mattress in. When I spoke to the front desk staff about the size of the room and how it was supposed to accomodate five people, she just apologized and offered to move us to a room with a kitchenette. This room was the same size so we did not switch. She said all their rooms were the same size. The kitchenette room, however, felt a LITTLE more roomy because the bathroom area was laid out differently and seemed to have more space, but the sleeping area was the same. As for the snacks in the room, they were a joke. The snacks were an 8 oz. bottle of water, a granola bar, and a microwave bag of popcorn. For the extra amount I was paying per night for this \"upgrade,\" I could go to the grocery store and buy a lot more snacks than what they provided. As for the room, it was supposed to be newly renovated, but it did not look like it. The carpet was sticky in spots--you know the type of room where you end up putting all your used towels on the floor because you don't want to touch the floor with your bare feet. The bedding and mattress were fine, but the pillows were very uncomfortable. They were really thick and firm--not soft at all. It was better for me to sleep without a pillow, and this may be personal preference, but I did not sleep well for the two nights we stayed there. Everything in the room was older and did not look \"renovated.\" The bathroom area was small as well. We were close to the pool which was nice. It was not noisy being closer to the pool which was a concern of mine. Bottom line, I would not pay the extra money to upgrade the room to the business class. It simply was not worth it. I told this to the front desk staff and they refunded the difference and just charged us the standard room rate. I was happy with this resolution. The staff at this hotel was very nice and accomodating. The pool and hot tub were quite nice and enjoyable. The area was clean. The restaurant, Pam Pam Cafe, was also nice, particularly the staff working there. We were always greeted with a smile and enthusiasm. The people seemed to enjoy what they were doing and it came through in their work attitude. The food was good too, typical diner fare. One other nice thing about this hotel was that parking was included, but the spots are small and tight (this may be a California thing). The parking is outdoor unless you are in the business class room which has covered parking--again not worth the extra money. There appeared to be plenty of parking spaces available. If you choose to stay at this hotel, don't pay extra for the business class room. If you have more than four in your party, you'll need two rooms in order to be comfortable. You might also want to bring your own pillow just in case, as well as a pair of slippers or flip flops to wear around the room.", "Date": "February 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canterbury, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cQuite happy at the Days Inn\u201d", "Author": "omalleycat_9", "ReviewID": "UR53909631", "Content": "We stayed at the Days Inn Hotel Circle January 5 - 13 2010 Location: Hotel Circle is just that, a huge circle of hotels and their restaurants on a busy road/freeway, not very scenic or within walking distance to much of interest. However the Fashion Valley Mall is 10-15 minutes walk away (there is a trolley station there too), there is a mini-mart/liquor store a few hotels down, and a bus stop outside the hotel. It doesn't take long to get to Seaworld, zoo etc by car or hotel shuttle. Hotel amenities/services: Computer with free internet access in reception was great. We absolutely loved the Pam Pam onsite restaurant, we ate there every night of our 8 night stay and several breakfasts as well. Children eat free with a paying adult. We thought the food selection was great, the prices reasonable, the atmosphere lovely and the staff mostly friendly and attentive ( we especially liked the lady who sometimes had her son in doing homework). TV in the corner if you want to watch sports. Free shuttle service is invaluable, there is only one service a day to each Seaworld and Zoo but it gets you there a few minutes before opening and picks up at closing (we found we needed the full days!) We did have a mix up on our last day of shuttle use, they agreed to take us down to the bayfront (not an official shuttle destination) and said 10AM. We went down to reception that morning to ask if they wanted to add us on to the Seaworld run instead of making a separate trip just for us but the driver said \"No I won't be ready for you until 10.30\" So at 10.20 we duly went down, the shuttle turned up soon after and the driver asked where we had been, he had waited for us at 10. He had definately said 10.30 (my husband and I both heard it clearly) but he insisted he had said 10. He called us a taxi which was nice, but my husband was unhappy and we wished we had just taken a taxi in the first place much earlier! However it is a free service and this was not an official destination so can't really hold this against the hotel. We had used shuttle for 5 days previously and it was very convenient with drivers helpfully making sure everyone knew what time pick up was. My husband was very keen to do the laundry once he discovered the seats and TV in the laundry room, he was most impressed with this! Room: We had a triple all-in-one room with kitchenette on 2nd level. Housekeeping standards were slightly lower than the other similarly priced hotels we stayed in while in the U.S (a few not quite clean pieces of kitchen equipment, bath could have been a bit cleaner , some little bits of paper on the floor in the corner of the room that were there on our arrival and still there on our departure) but this didn't detract from our stay. There were one or two cockroaches around in the mornings but they didn't worry us (we were really surprised at the lack of flies around in California - here in New Zealand they are a big problem in houses in warmer weather). The toilet blocked on first use (a bit embarassing!) but they sent someone up to sort it out immediately after we reported the problem which was great and there were no further problems. The first time we were in our room when someone walked past normally outside on the balcony we thought the San Andreas fault had opened up! The entire floor of the room would shake every time someone walked by but this was more amusing than annoying. We live in an 1800s wooden house which has fairly bouncy floors, but it seems very stable compared to the Days hotel! We had no noise issues from either the road or other rooms. Staff: We were VERY grateful to get into our room 4 hours before check in time, upon our arrival just prior to 12 the staff member sorted a room out within a few minutes, we would have been happy just to have the bags stored until official time. Desk employees were generally a little more abrupt than we had experienced in our prior hotels on this trip, however they did handle everything efficiently and we were impressed with how they dealt with a huge influx of guests coming off a cruise ship. One older lady desk employee could not give us any help on how to take public transport to downtown San Diego ( a fairly popular destination I would imagine!) and told us to look it up on the internet so we didn't seek any further advice from hotel staff about sightseeing, transport etc. So there were a few minor issues which needed to be reported for the full story but we had a very enjoyable stay nonetheless and have great memories of our time at the Days. Our 6 year old loved it there and declared it the best hotel of our 4 week trip to Hawaii and California.", "Date": "January 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Queensland", "Title": "\u201cGreat value, great location, great service, great hotel\u201d", "Author": "jigsaw09", "ReviewID": "UR52410517", "Content": "I have just returned from a US holiday travelling on my own.

Staff was very friendly and helpful they'll get tickets and book reservations for area attractions for you. Room was clean, beds were super comfy, Nice granite vanity tops. AC, refrigerator, Microwave, blow dryer, iron all worked well. Computer in lobby was helpful for printing boarding passes and show schedules for Seaworld. We used the hotel shuttle to visit Seaworld and it worked out just fine. It does run on a set schedule so reserve a seat the day prior. We never had any parking issues arriving back at the hotel around 10pm each night. It did appear that the hotel was full each night as the parking lot was full when I awoke each morning. We did most of our swimming at the beaches, which are very easy to get to from here. On one evening we got back around 9pm and went for a swim in the pool and used the hot tub..both get thumbs up. As for noise we didn't experience any though we were on the third floor with no one above us..and regarding highway noise......I never heard any, besides every hotel on hotel circle is along the highway so how can you single this one out. honestly with an AC running I never heard any offensive, annoying noise even with it off I didn't. We did eat breakfast each morning at the hotel restaurant and our plates were clean when we left. Never was around for lunch or dinner so can't say. Bottom line, I was looking for a clean, safe, comfortable place with a pool, close to all the attractions I was interested in seeing at a good price and that was exactly what I got...in fact knowing that many of the hotels in the area have been around awhile I set my expectations accordingly.

I thought it was very nice of them to take the time to do that for me. They made my whole experience of staying at that hotel comfortable and accomodating. Unfortunately, I booked 2 days but needed 3 and was unable to book the third room due to high demand that weekend. However, the person that assisted me with locating the horseback riding facility gave me a number to a local agency there in San Diego that specializes in last minute deals.

However, not everyone was so lucky, we arrived on a Monday and that may have helped, someone checking in on a Friday when we left (at 10 a.m.) we told they did not have any rooms ready for them.

Pool and spa, though located way in the back of property, were very nice. Wireless internet was great convenience. Shuttle: A big reason we booked this was for the shuttle, as we didn't want to rent a car. Be aware the shuttle runs to limited places, airport, zoo, Sea World, Marine Base and at set times, so the shuttle is not there for whenever you want to come and go. If the shuttle is not busy, they may take you other places, however, we took the shuttle to Old Town and when we called for a pick up, it was not available for over an hour, so we took a taxi back (cost $12). Also, even if you sign up for a pick up time, the shuttle may be early/late and will not wait for you, they pick up whoever is standing there and leave, so be early to your pick up. Also, airport times are also set, every two hours, so we had to take the shuttle three hours before our flight. (or else take the one hour before our fight, that's taking a chance) Con's: Lot's of noise from nearby freeway and streets, (so bring earplugs or run the a/c or fan all night), little choice in eating without a car, their Pam Pam Cafe is just OK, nothing special, another places you need to walk to, computer in lobby was always being used and the night before/morning we left, the computer was broken so don't rely on this to print boarding passes, spa/pool are small considering size of place, so they were very crowded when we went.

We had no idea what area we wanted to stay in, and hotel circle seemed to be in a good location from a map we were looking at. PROS: Room was mostly updated and very clean. We stayed in room 250, which was directly over the hotel's Pam Pam Restaurant. Initially we thought this would be a problem-not so. We heard NO noise at all while we slept, but did hear some noise in the evening. Nothing that convinced us we needed to move to a different room, though we did request if that was a possibility. If you want complete silence, this isn't your place. We heard people flushing toilets and running water at times in the evening. Not a big deal for us. The shuttle service was very handy-used it to pick us up at the airport, took us to the zoo, and to Old Town San Diego..Very nice drivers who were very helpful. Shuttles DONT run 24/7-we had to take a cab to the airport because our flight left at 6am, shuttle doesn't run until 6. The tiny lobby had a computer with free access-great for printing our boarding passes. We also thought the discount tickets for the zoo offered at the lobby were a good deal. CONS: This hotel is facing a highway. Expect highway noise. I'm a city girl, so this really didn't bother me, except for the occasional tractor trailer. There is no fitness room..I thought there was..I guess I misread the hotel description-unless I missed it somewhere?! Pool and spa are in the rear of the buildings up a small hill. There was no way I was walking all the way back there. (I'm on vacation..call me lazy). Very little to eat in the area unless you had transportation to go elsewhere. The only perk was rolling out of bed and going directly below us for breakfast. The coffee machine in the room had some decent coffee! the view was of the stairs out my window. Again, not a big deal, but if you want a view, forget it. You wont get it here. The TV..now this was interesting..it had terrible static. I'm not one to watch tv when I'm on vacation, but when I wake up, I do like to watch the weather channel. The static made that a challenge. Not horrible that I couldn't hear, but bad enough that I thought, Hmm, they need to upgrade this set soon. All in all..I'm going to give this hotel a decent rating. If you are looking for a clean, moderately priced hotel..this is a go. I won't return, simply because it wasn't really near the areas that I enjoyed most.

First day was ok but the room had a horrible smell in it. Also, the air conditioner did not work properly. they sent up a maintenance person to look at it and he took off the cover and I saw they had the controls locked so that guests couldn't turn down the air as low as possible. He took off the switch blocking the warmer temperatures and the room cooled right down. The shuttle did come in handy as we were spending two days at Sea World-didn't have to pay to park which was nice. Day two we received a phone call to our room pretty close to 1 am (yes 1 am). I answered the phone and it was the night manager telling me to move my car immediately or he would have it towed. Startled out of a dead sleep, I couldn't understand why he wanted my car moved. I woke my husband up and told him it was the manager and we had to move our car. By this time, our daughter was awake too. He didn't like how the car was parked and wanted me to move to a different spot! After a lot of discussion (yes, we were angry) the manager told me he could have us arrested since San Diego has a parking lot patrol and they could give me a ticket for the way I had parked my car (MIND YOU THE CAR HAD BEEN THERE FOR TWO DAYS). I said a ticket for what? It's not in a handicapped space, it's in a normal parking space, OUTLINED AND MARKED IN WHITE PAINT BY THE HOTEL. I stated that I didn't believe him-- that San Diego had a hotel parking lot patrol. And, he said it was true and he was doing me a huge favor and I should thank him. By this time it's well after 1 am. The manager was extremely angry with me questioning his motives--AND we then realized what his motives were. While we were locking up our car, we saw two guests that had just checked in pull into the parking space we were asked to move our car from (I can only guess that these individuals were his friends or something. The night manager wanted my car moved so these \"new guests\" could have the spot I was parked in. The whole episode was absolutely ridiculous. In the morning I contacted Getaway today and got a refund for the balance of our stay and we left asap.

After reading the reviews I thought this hotel was going to be quite good, and was expecting the staff to be super friendly as it has been said before. After travelling by car from Las Vegas we were eager to just get to our room. Upon arrival receptionist Bianca was a little cold, no smile, no welcoming just doing her job. We had requested 2 beds, we get to our room and we have a king bed!! Go back down to reception which is a hike as we were on level 3 and very far back from the front of the hotel. Bianca issues new keys and tells me it says on her computer King Bed. I had paper work with me and it clearly says 2 beds. Ok go back up to new room and the keys don't work!! Totally annoying!! Go all the way back down and she wrote the wrong room number down, and said a very reluctant ' sorry'. Finally got to our room. The room has a very musty smell, I think the hotel knows this, as on Level 3 the next day all available rooms had their doors open to air them. Rooms are ok but the smell ruins it. Part of our package was free continental breakfast. I'm thinking cereal, juice, toast, fruit um no.... you get a juice and a choice of toast, muffin or bagel, just 1!!! Another issue we had, was when we were out in downtown we lost our hotel room key with our room number on it! I know silly!! But anyway we rung the hotel and told them to cancel the key just in case someone has found it and gone to our room. But no!! the hotel could not cancel our key because we have to be there in person to recieve the new key?? huh??? It was their 'policy'...after much discussion and getting quite firm with them, they finally cancelled our key. Apart from these issues the hotel shuttle saved this hotel from getting a 1 star!! The shuttle was very helpful and accommadating. I think they should print a timetable so it is clearer on when the shuttle leaves and picks-up. I did hear one family say it did not pick them up from the zoo when it was meant too and they had to get a cab.

The next morning after breakfast (which by the way is NOT free), my husband noticed our cameras had been stolen from our room!! $2,000 worth of cameras and equipment. Gone. Coincidentally, when he walked up to the room after breakfast, which happened to be at 10:45 a.m. and checkout time is 12:00 noon, cleaning personnel were scattering from our room when they saw him coming. After contacting the San Diego Police department, we were informed that this happens frequently at this hotel!! They must be making more money from their camera resales than their rooms!! You would think some of the \"extra\" proceeds would be spent to freshen up the rooms! When we approached the girl and the man in the lobby/front desk and informed them of what happened, they were uncooperative, rude, and inconsiderate. Unfortunately we didn't have time to pursue it before our shuttle left to take us to the cruise terminal. Upon our return from the cruise, I insisted that their management tell me why cleaning personnel were in my room at all before checkout time!! Their representative (I have a name if you'd like to contact me) informed me that there was no way and that they do not enter rooms before checkout time. I told him my husband caught them in there! They finally removed the key lock from the door and electronically tracked the entries into our room. SURE ENOUGH!!! It proved what my husband had said that there WERE IN FACT cleaning people in our room when they should not have been in there! We were checking out that morning, therefore they had no business in there before noon. The hotel representative (again, I have his name if you'd like) claims their time log shows the unauthorized entry at 11:56a.m. (which by the way is still before noon), however I have breakfast receipts showing either #1 the time stamp on their door locks has the incorrect time, or #2 The Days representative \"conveniently\" added an hour to the entry time of the cleaning folks. Either way, my cameras are gone, never to return. My 4-year old daughter's first dance recital DVD was in the camcorder, as well as my son's Kindergarten graduation DVD, and many other moments in our lives that cannot be replaced. Not to mention we took a cruise with no cameras. I asked their representative to fax or email a copy of the key entry report he obtained and that we were discussing, but he said he would not provide a copy to me, and that I would have to obtain it though the Police Dept. or my attorney, which is what I am in the process of doing at the moment. The last time their representative and I spoke regarding the incident (Friday), he became beligerant, accusing my husband and I of having \"changed\" our stories, lying, and basically fabricating the entire story. After speaking with him for the last time, I felt like I was on trial for my cameras being stolen!! Needless to say, I doubt the Days Hotel will replace my cameras without getting our attorney involved. Their representative seemed quite used to the procedure of dealing with customers who have had belongings stolen with his canned responses and defenses for the hotel, which coincides nicely with the statement from the police department. He even mentioned more than once that \"everyone else\" who has something stolen, or \"all the other people,\" etc. I am certain I am not the only one. With this said, I am contimplating contacting Primetime or 20/20 Investigates or Dateline to expose this apparent ring of camera theft at this hotel! If you choose this hotel, HANG ON TO YOUR BELONGINGS!!!! I am a firm believer in what goes around certainly does come back around. I hope whoever has my cameras feels really good about the money they make on my cameras after throwing my DVD's of my children in the garbage. My husband and myself are both employees of a major U.S. airline and have been for nearly 50 years collectively. This is the first time in our lifetimes of traveling the world that we have experienced such as this. We do however plan to share our experience with the Days Hotel with as many fellow employees, travelers, family members, friends and San Diego-based military personnel as possible.", "Date": "June 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cOk but they charged tax that wasn't on web site\u201d", "Author": "wsame", "ReviewID": "UR17235826", "Content": "We stayed June 22 for 2 nights and found the hotel condition to be about average 3 star mainly because it was old but functional.

I specifically wanted a hotel with free shuttle service because I did not want to rent a car. After reading many positive reviews about Days Inn's shuttle service, I definitely wanted to stay there, but I wanted to avoid getting a room in the older section of the hotel with exterior corridors because of the negative reviews about the quality of those rooms. There were very positive reviews, though, about the newer rooms in the Sunset wing at the rear of the hotel called Business Place rooms. I originally booked two exterior corridor rooms on Trip Rewards for just $76.50, but then I called the hotel directly and spoke with Tanya, the reservations manager. I told her that I was concerned about the quality of those rooms, and she told me that when we arrived if there were any Business Place rooms available that she would upgrade us at no extra charge. Those rooms usually are at a rate of about $145 per night, so getting them for just $76.50 really saved me a ton of money. I later learned that Tanya went ahead and upgraded us to Business Place rooms even before we got there. The Business Place rooms are terrific! The furnishings and decor are very nice. The beds are clean, comfortable, and neatly made. There is a refrigerator and microwave in the rooms. A very nice added touch is that each day, the hotel supplies its Business Place guests with a Snack Pack which consists of two bottles of water, two granola bars, and two packs of microwave popcorn. Believe me, all of those items come in handy! The housekeeping staff is excellent. Please be sure to tip them! All the positive reviews that I read about the shuttle service and the front desk people were true. They were great! When we arrived at the San Diego airport, I called the hotel, and in just a few minutes a shuttle came to get us. It was too early to check in, so Brian stored our luggage, and then another shuttle took us to Sea World. I originally scheduled a 2:45 pickup, but I called the hotel and rescheduled for a 6:00 pickup with no hassles at all. At 6:00 the shuttle was there right on time to take us back to the hotel. Carl and Gerald were two of the terrific shuttle drivers. The shuttles are a life saver when you don't want to rent a car. We gave the drivers generous tips. Gerald was the shuttle driver who took us to the zoo. He was just great. On the way to the zoo, he gave us info on what to expect, and he also had a nice treat for us. It was a warm day, and he gave each passenger a cold bottle of water to keep us hydrated while at the zoo. Way to go, Gerald! The Pam Pam Cafe is right next to the hotel. The food there is delicious. Nicole and Ray are excellent and attentive servers. They deserved all the tips we left for them! On our final day in San Diego our flight was scheduled for 3:00, and the shuttle to the airport was scheduled for 1:00. Check-out time is 12:00, so I called the front desk to request a one-hour extension on our stay. No problem! Jean at the front desk was so accommodating. She extended our stay without hesitation. I would definitely stay at the Days Inn again, and I would absolutely recommend it to other people who are visiting San Diego.

After we made a phone call to the hotel from the airport, a driver from the hotel picked us up at the airport within a short period of time (15 minutes?) Check in was quick and easy. Our room was on the 2nd floor accessible by an elevator, but it was quicker to take the stairs. The room was your average Days Inn room - 2 queen size beds, full bath, tv and enough storage space. We did like having the small refrigerator in the room. As we were visiting relatives in San Diego, we did not rent a car, however, if you are staying here for vacation without knowing someone there, I would strongly suggest getting a rental. There was trolley and bus service right in front of the hotel. We used the trolley to go to the waterfront. The hotel offered transportation to the San Diego Zoo/Balboa Park which we used. It worked out very well - on time and no problems. There is also service to Sea World but we didn't stay long enough to go there. After a day out, we wanted to go to Old Towne for dinner and called the front desk for a taxi recommendation. As the hotel driver was not busy he took us downtown! He told us to call the hotel when we were done, and he would pick us up where he dropped us off. We tipped him for his time. Our room was always neat and clean. There is a small restaurant on the site which served good food at reasonable prices. Nothing real fancy. I think we were in San Diego the only week of the year that it wasn't warm and sunny! We scouted out the pool but never went swimming. Looked nice enough. There was also a hot tub outdoors. There are no stores within walking distance so if you want snacks for the room get them while you are out and about. There was one small convenience/package store that we found, but as all convenience stores, it was overpriced and not a big selection. The day before our return trip, we checked with the driver for a trip back to the airport. When we were ready to leave the next day, we checked out and the driver had our bags loaded and off we went. All in all the hotel was good for a week long stay, but what made it above average was the staff - always accommodating and helpful. I would recommend staying at the Days Inn - Hotel Circle.

My husband started coughing and my daughters said they had headaches.

This property was exactly as advertised - a cheap, clean budget hotel with few frills. The location was good; nothing was more than a 20 minute ride from the hotel.

There are few restaurants on this strip and fewer places to purchase groceries/supplies. It is easy to reach these things from Hotel Circle if you have a car, but if not, your choices are very limited. The room itself was adequately-sized and contained a small kitchenette (two burners, a microwave, small fridge and some dishes and silverware). The room had a pretty funky odor upon arrival, but I stopped noticing the smell after a day or two (the rest of my family did not and complained about it throughout the stay). Otherwise, things were clean and reasonably comfortable. Another nice plus was the free internet access. Even if you do not bring your own laptop, the front desk area has a computer for guest use. This came in handy for making online reservations, getting directions, checking e-mail, etc. The staff was friendly and accommodating and took care of nearly every request we made. One final caveat: parking here is very limited. If you return to the hotel past 9:00 pm, you may have great difficulty in finding a parking space, especially if you have a car larger than a compact.

A real pleasant stay!", "Date": "December 13, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Days Hotel Circle by SeaWorld", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d556822-Reviews-Days_Hotel_Circle_by_SeaWorld-San_Diego_California.html", "Price": "$86 - $182*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">543 Hotel Circle South</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Diego</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">92108</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "556822", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/8e/fc/41/the-days-hotel-hotel.jpg"}}
