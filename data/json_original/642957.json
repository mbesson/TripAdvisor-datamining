Breakfast was continental style and was more than adequate to prepare us for the day ahead. Staff were friendly, very helpful and speak good English, which is important if, like me, your Italian is very limited. The location was definitely the highlight of this hotel, being approximately 10 mins walk from Termini station and within walking distance of all the main attractions (we even walked to and from the Vatican). There are numerous restaurants in the surrounding streets, and if you eat away from the main piazza's dinner can be very reasonably priced! The only negative thing we can think of is that the hotel is located on the 3rd floor and if you don't fancy getting in the old lift (we were never brave enough to try it) you will have to carry your luggage up a number of stairs.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sao Paulo", "Title": "\u201cGood Location - Good Room\u201d", "Author": "joaomadrid", "ReviewID": "UR125532245", "Content": "Near a major street, a few blocks away from the subway and very close to some of the most famous attractions.

Therefore we had to carry the luggage up to that floor and take the elevator to the third floor where the hotel was situated. Upon our check in we were welcomed by a very friendly and professional receptionist, named Massimiliano, who needless to say, helped us through our whole stay. The hotel had 4 men working at the front desk and along with Massimiliano, only another man( I am sorry, but I don't remember his name-he used to work the night shift) were helpful. The other two, including the owner's son did not live up to our expectations. Both my friend and I have been working in the field of tourism for over 10 years, I am a tour guide and she works in a hotel. Anyway, the location was as described on trip advisor by other subscribers and was very close to almost everything. Although we were satisfied by the location of the hotel,since it was our first trip to Rome and needed one that would allow us to go to several places on foot, I can not say the same thing about the service in general. Entering in the room, a bag filled with used paper, used by the previous tenants had not been removed from the bathroom. Moreover, the towels and the sheets did not smell as if they had been washed, they had a bad smell. Even the closet where we would hang our coats, had a funny smell and when we would take them out of it, they would smell terribly bad. During our first night, it was very cold (we were unlucky/lucky to have arrived in Rome when it was snowing!!) and we tried to turn on the a/c but it was not working, so we called the front desk to ask if they could fix it. When the receptionist showed up, by just looking at the indication and not checking anything else, he said \"But it is working. The sun means that hot air is coming out\". And that was that for him, but my friend asked him to check the ventilator because not only was there not hot air coming out, but the small proportion of air circulating in the room, was cold. Anyway, he did not seem very happy to be bothered, but after protesting about it, he went and checked it through a main system and fixed it. We only had breakfast one day before we departed and I can say that we were not very pleased by it. The coffee was good, but everything else looked like it had been bought by a super market and was not very fresh. Next to the hotel there was a little coffee shop, named \"dolci dolcezze\", where we would have our morning coffee to start the day, (very cheap coffee and very very tasty) and something to eat. Everyday douzens of Italians would pass by to have something to drink or eat before they went to work. It is one of the best memories we have from Rome. Overall, the hotel was close to everything either on foot or by metro/ public bus transportation, the rate was reasonable for ist category, but I think there are a lot of things to be fixed, before I can recommend it. P.S make sure you are aware of the fact that you will be charged for the tax which is not icluded. The charge is 2 euros per person per night.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Binghamton,NY", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel\u201d", "Author": "UpstateMom4", "ReviewID": "UR125105394", "Content": "My sister and I stayed there in late October for three nights.

We are a young couple (aged 22 and 23). We looked at many hotels online before finally booking this one and it was done purely for the price. We paid \u00a3200 for two people for 4 nights B&B which is exceptionally good for the location of this hotel in Rome. We got a bus from the airport to Termini, and then walked to the hotel. It took about 10minutes with 2 cases! Look up walking directions on yahoo maps from Termini to the Hotel before you go and you will have no problem...easy! The hotel is in a building of many floors (containing apartments and some businesses) so there are a lot of stairs - but there is also a lift, which like stated in other reviews, is a bit creaky and old-school but works none the less and helped out after a long day of walking! Hotel staff are very lovely and very helpful, the manager is great (tall slim man with dark hair). There is someone at the desk 24 hours a day which I always find comforting. They have maps at reception and will help you out with directions and bus numbers etc. Rooms are basic but spotlessly clean and cleaned well every day. Bathroom is very nice and always spotles. Beds are very hard but I hear this is normal in Italy and it didnt stop me sleeping! Each room has a unit on the wall where you can control the AC/Heat which was great as it wasnt summertime and I am always cold. There is also a safe in the room which you dont need to pay a deposit for...i'ts ready to go. This was very handy and we used it. Negatives about the room - there are no tea/coffee making facilities which we really missed. Also, although it won't matter to some - the TV doesnt have any english channels. We dont drink so we were getting back to the hotel about 10pm and luckily we had books and magazines and also brought an ipod with mini speakers, but usually when we are away there are 1 or 2 channels that we can stick on in the background. The hotel also doesnt have Wi-Fi but the manager told us he is going to be doing this in the New Year and I am sure it will say on their website when they do. Little facts! The hairdryer - for girls like myself who have very long and naturally wavy hair ...it's very old school and weak but it did the trick. We were flying with Ryanair so I couldn't afford the extra weight to take my own but I survived with their hairdryer - and brought my own mini-straigthners to smooth over after! You dont get any proper shampoos/conditioner so either bring your own or buy them at the wee shop accross the street. Breakfast - is basic but it did the trick. For fussy eaters it may not be too great. There are 2 cereals, an oaty one and a corn flake type one. Croissants, mini rolls and fruit cocktail. There are a selection of jams also. There is plenty of tea and coffee (my boyfriend cannot function without his morning coffee and was having many cups to fill up!) but this is only available at breakfast time which is 7am until 10am I think it was. I am quite particular but just ate anyway to start the day! Main sites... Trevi Fountain (which is where we ended up every night for pizza and gelato) is about 10-15 minutes walk. Colosseum - about 10 mins walk. Pantheon - about 10/15 One day we even walked back from the Vatican which was about 40 minutes although you can get the 64 bus accross the main road outside what looks like a big Museum (you will know the building when you see it...its at the end of the hotels street, big grand and white!). This bus (the 64) will take you to Vatican City if you stay on till the end. The bus stops are really easy to read so dont be scared to use them! We didnt in fear of getting lost but by the last day we could hardly feel our feet and tried it and its so easy. We just got on and off and managed to see all the sites one last time (starting from The Vatican Museum) in about 5 hours! So the bus stop next to the hotel is very handy. There is a pastry/coffee shop right next to the hotel which was very handy after breakfast time was over in the hotel. There is also a few restaurants on the street but we did not try them. There is also a little grocery store accross the street which was handy for juice/chocolate/crisps/fruit to take back to the hotel.", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cBOOKING NIGHTMARE!!!\u201d", "Author": "angela1976", "ReviewID": "UR121740033", "Content": "What an absolute rip-off.

It doesn't have a fridge, which I thought was a bit of a shame, and the hotel doesn't have a computer or wi-fi available. They did have two televisions on the room though (an old model and a new model), so maybe they can sell them and buy a computer for it that hotel guests can use?

I wanted to post a review to help other people who were also drowning in the options. I am pleased to say we enjoyed our stay at Galatea and would recommend it for a city break. To summarise and address some other review comments. Location - within easy walking distance to Metro line, bus stops, Trevi fountain and Colosseum. It's in an inner residential courtyard on 3rd floor only so it's not immediately obvious. We had no problems but if you are a single, more vulnerable type it may be a little disconcerting. We usually used the stairs but the lift, despite it's rickety looks, worked fine. Staff - excellent, courteous reception, willing to offer advice and spoke good english. Room 315. Large, very clean and well furnished. We overlooked a minor side street. Beds were on the firm side, but not uncomfortable and it is the Italian way. Bathroom large, but shower was a little small but more importantly always plenty of hot water. I didn't notice any significant smell from the drains. Quiet room for sleeping, you could hear the road (beep) and breakfast clear-up >8am but was never a problem as this room was away from serving area. Breakfast. There were no kitchen facilities so all food was pre-prepared / from a packet. More importantly it tasted fine and it was well attended so there was plenty of it. There were approx 4 tables x4 seats so I guess if every guest wanted to eat at the same time it would be crowded but never a problem for us. Maybe more of an issue in peak season. Value - hotels in Rome are as a rule not cheap, especially close to the city centre. I used booking.co and the price looked comparable to other similar hotels. I hope this helps. This hotel is a great place to recharge after a day spent seeing the spectacular and (often very crowded) sights on Rome.

The reception desk staff were unfailingly welcoming and very pleasant and on arrival we were given a really useful map. The receptionist took a great deal of care in giving us directions and advice. The room was recently refurbished and, although on the firm side, the bed was comfortable. The bathroom had an excellent drench shower with plentiful hot water and toiletries provided.

The location is impeccable, I'll give them that, very easy to get to and from everywhere in Rome, super central. But the condition is disasterous. The painting in my room's walls was peeling, so was the wood from the windows. Sheets weren't changed, neither were towels, and neither was the soap in the bathroom. Rock-hard bed and pillows, ridiculously uncomfortable. Tacky decor, depressing even, very very far from a boutique hotel. Or even a decent hotel. Now let's talk about food - breakfast. Everything served is second-brand, like things you only see for sale at wholesale places like Booker, or discount markets Lidl or Poundland(in the UK). I'm not kidding. I had a peek in the pantry and there the were, the fruit salad from massive tin cans, the croissants and brad loafs from massive plastic bags.The coffee, from a vending machine (not a proper coffee machine) and this was in Italy (!) You think they'd get at least the coffee right. Finally, the little cheese pieces wrapped in foil, like those from \"The Laughing Cow\", were a copy brand called \"The Happy Cow\". Which were what I think sent me to the A&E in London 12 hours later. I had a three day trip with my sister and we ate exactly the same things, exactly, with the exception of the foil cheese and toast I had for breakfast on the last day that she hadn't. I started feeling ill at around 7pm when I was, thank god, already back in London, and then by the time it was 11pm my sister was calling the ambulance. The doctor said it was most likely this cheese and for sure something I had for breakfast, as the type of bacteria from bad food I contracted takes 8 to 12 hours to act on your stomach.

All in all, it was good value, was close to all the major sites and the staff were very friendly and helpful. They even contacted us to arrange a pickup from the airport (EUR 55) which was great after the long flight from Australia and not bad value as taxi costs approx EUR 40 and train tickets are EUR 14 each. For a bit more detail, here are a few thoughts of mine: Proximity to the sights of Rome. We walked everywhere from Galatea as we are all happy to walk 10-20 minutes to get to the historical sites - Colosseo, Forum, Trevi Fountain etc. We even walked back from Trastevere one day. It was a great way to burn off all that pasta, pizza and gelati! For one day we did do the hop-on, hop-off tour which got us a bit further afield and although I would not recommend the company we used (the red double-decker company you find in every city in the world were absolutely hopeless in Rome) it was a handy mode of transportation if nothing else. The entrance. It is a little off-putting. I walked in thinking 'what have we got ourselves into here' as the \"courtyard\" is dark, a bit dingy and is certainly not welcoming. But don't be put off. Upstairs is a lovely, modernised and clean hotel. The lift. As so many other people here have commented - you really need to make sure the external door is shut when you get out at the hotel floor (it sticks), otherwise it wont work and you may leave other guests stranded at ground level with their luggage. I gave it a bit of a bump with my hip to make sure it was always closed. If you do get stranded, there is an intercom on the outside of the building (out on the street) and you can buzz up to reception and they'll shut the door for you so the lift will work. Amenities-wise this is pretty much a no-frills hotel. There are no fridges in the rooms or kettle etc, the beds are very firm and the pillows are slim. However the rooms are clean (cleaned daily) the fittings are new and our bathroom was great - big and nicely decorated. And it was super-dark and quiet with the shutters closed and the curtains drawn so we all slept very well. Breakfast was a typical Italian hotel affair - cold and sweet - which was fine for us. I enjoyed making my own little espresso every morning to have with it. The staff were really helpful and friendly. In particular one of the men who worked there pointed out places of interest and even a close-by laundromat. He also offered advice on visiting the Vatican Museum which was very useful. He suggested not to pre-book tickets like we wanted and to just line up since we were going in the early morning and the queues shouldn't be too bad. I admit, we were hesitant to follow this advice but he was right. The queue to get into the Basillica was long, but moved very quickly and after our visit there we walked around the block to the Museo and lined up for about 5 minutes to get in.

Overall, this is a good 3 star hotel and I would recommend this hotel.", "Date": "June 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Staffordshire England", "Title": "\u201cGood location\u201d", "Author": "marydairy", "ReviewID": "UR16161694", "Content": "I have recently stayed at this hotel for a long weekend. The location of this hotel is it's best feature. It is within walking distance to the Termini, underground station and most of the historical sites.

If you are after 5 star accomodation then this is not the right hotel for you.The rooms are clean and bathroom consisted of a bath and shower which was brilliant. As others have commented, I can confirm that the bed is hard and takes a little getting used to. There is no lounge or bar area at the hotel but there is a lovely restaurant right next door to the entrance to the hotel where good food and wine were sampled. This hotel is a good choice if you want reasonable priced accomodation which is central to the tourist trail.

The Hotel is only 10 minute or so walk from Termini station, off Via Nazionale.

We were greeted by friendly staff who were helpful in pointing out on a map, where we were in realtion to places, and suggested sights to see, then took us to our room, which was modern and clean, and quite spacious. The bathroom also excellent with a great shower. Breakfast was simply, but adequate. Next door to the hotel is a restaurant New Mary Meeting, which was very handy for the first night., although there were others close by, The hotel is situated very well to get round Rome on foot, only 10-15 minutes from the Forum. We booked 24 hours on the open top bus which was good value. If you go the the Trastevere area, I recommend a great local Osteria at 41 Via della Lungara, and in the Camp de Fiori Baffetto 2, a simply pizza restaurant, but great food. I would certainly recomment this hotel for a week end for its central position for sightseeing, and all the helpful friendly staff who made our stay great.", "Date": "March 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belfast, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201chotel galatea\u201d", "Author": "grooviechique", "ReviewID": "UR13777787", "Content": "just returned from rome stayed in hotel galatea very central and easy to get to all attractions. room was nice, cleaned every day. bed very hard would recommend this hotel", "Date": "February 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "minneapolis", "Title": "\u201can honest review of Hotel Galatea\u201d", "Author": "johnnyminneapolis", "ReviewID": "UR12325495", "Content": "Just got back 7 nights. The entrance to the hotel is not easy to spot from the street as it is off a main street, Nationale. once you find it, you have to walk through a dirty looking cement alley foyer to get to the main door of the hotel building. turn left and there are steps and a lift. use the lift, which is small and can only fit two people with their bags. go to the third floor. once there, go into the frosted glass doors into the hotel foyer. the hotel is on one floor, 3rd floor of a building. there is 17 rooms. we had 301, orange room, with a walk out window to balcony. which was at the end of the hallway. the entire hotel hallways is nicely painted, clean and bright. the people at desk we helpful, spoke english too. they were helpful and courteous. maid service cleaned everyday although, right outside our door was the maid service closet so they were noisy in the morning while we were trying to sleep. Now the bad stuff... the entrance is dark, dingy and almost looks like a alley with cars and mopeds parked there. trash is put out every day too. so it is not attractive at all. the hallways up to the hotel are dark and dirty too and can use some paint. the lift is tiny but worked fine. the rooms are tiny. you have about 2 feet of space around the bed. but the ceilings were high so that helped make it look a little larger. the bathroom in 301 is tiny. it is about 3 feet by 6 feet, the shower is 3x4 feet and tiny. the water pressure was fine and water was hot. the bed is hard. almost like laying on a carpet floor. so if you like soft beds, this is not the place for you. The breakfast is nothing to rave about. it is continental; cereal, bagels that seemed to be 2-3 days old and milk and coffee from a machine. not anything great but it's included. don't expect a real breakfast such as omletes or anything to that nature. a few days into our stay, we smelled a weird smell in our room and we thought maybe it was just us that smelled, dirty clothes, etc. but in reality, the smell was in the hallways too. not too disturbing but you can notice it. so not sure where it was from, possibly a sewer or drain letting out gases??? not sure what they were nor did we ask them about it. the hot water heat broke on our last day there so there was no hot water for showers. it didnt bother us since we were leaving that day, but i'm sure all 17 rooms of people who had stayed were not happy. Also, the hallway is all marble floors and no tapestry, so you hear everything that is going on from the hallways into your room. it echos right through the doors. so you hear people closing doors, talking, footsteps, maids walking up and down, clanking, etc. so it can be a bit noisy if you like to sleep without noises. the rooms share a buiding that people live in, so you will hear the neighbors too at times. we heard someone doing the italian-bump a few times, but lucky for us, it took him only 10 minutes. but it was loud enough to wake us. the water pipes are probably plastic PVC too because you hear the water swishing through them when they flush toilets, run showers amd sink water, etc. which is a bit noisy too. It is not exactly close to the major sites so prepare to walk. 15-20 minutes to coluseum, 5 minutes to republica and train station, 20+ minutes to spanish steps, etc. The vatican is a long walk. the location is good though, on side street off busy Nationale, which has some good stores, restaurants, etc. Overall, this is a safe clean hotel in a safe area. the staff were helpful and friendly. spoke english too. for a budget hotel, under 100euro a night, this is a good decision because i felt it was safe and the rooms were cleaned everyday too with new towels, etc. the location was pretty good too but if you want to be in the hub of the city, i suggest a hotel near Navonna or the Pantheon, which is a little more centralized to everything. if questions, feel free to email me.", "Date": "January 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens", "Title": "\u201cExcellent value for little money\u201d", "Author": "alexbogd", "ReviewID": "UR11079725", "Content": "A modern, recently refurbished hotel in a stone's throw from the historic centre of the city.

We wanted a nice place to stay, that was reasonably priced and in a good location. The Hotel Galatea definitely ticked all those boxes!! It was late at night when we arrived (2am), and as said in a previous review, the hotel entrance left a lot to be desired!! The hotel is on the 3rd floor of an old palace, and you have to go in through a large gateway and through a dark courtyard to find the entrance to the stairwell and the quirky little elevator to bring you up to bring you up to the 3rd floor. At this stage, my finace was starting to wonder what he had let himself in for!!!! Once you get to the third floor however and go through the door into the reception area, any doubts in your mind will be expelled. The reception area itself is decorated in a bright and modern fashion, and even at the late hour that we arrived, the receptionist on duty had perfect english, something you don't often find. The room itself was large and had everything we needed. The bed was a little harder than I would have liked, but you can't have everything!! The bathroom was bigger than most hotel bathrooms and the power in the shower was just the thing you needed to get you going in the morning. Unlike the previous review, our room had a large bath tub which was very welcome in the evening to soak my sore feet!! Breakfast was basic enough, but it had all the essentials and that it generally what you get on the continent. The rooms were cleaned daily and the reception staff were always very friendly and helpful. The location of the hotel was ideal as it was only a five minute walk from Repubblica metro station and from there you could get to all the historical sights and the Vatican. Compared to the other hotels in the area, the price was an absolute steal for the quality of service that we received, and on our next trip to Rome, we will definitely be staying there again.", "Date": "October 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Irvine, California", "Title": "\u201cSpacious, contemporary hotel\u201d", "Author": "ocphotographer", "ReviewID": "UR8658165", "Content": "The other reviewers were accurate in warning that the outside of the hotel looks quite dumpy.
