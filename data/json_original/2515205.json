My first couple of trips were a success and until recently this would have been be my first choice of boutique hotel in Paris. I wholeheartedly recommended it to colleagues after a very good first stay. The hotel is in a very convenient St Germain location and is in a beautiful and light and airy old building. I've stayed in most room types at the hotel, from suites to the most basic rooms and the beds are very comfortable and most rooms appear to have been recently decorated in a comfortable and modern style. The suites near the top of the building are lovely. The doorman is always charming and helpful as are the staff at the bar. The receptionists are variable in their helpfulness. Last year I stayed at the Montalembert twice and was disappointed both times. In spite of booking well in advance, both rooms I was given were smokey and overlooking the noisy street outside the front of the hotel. On both occasions I asked to move room. On my most recent trip there was only one alternative room available, the smallest room on the top floor of the building. The room was the smallest I've stayed in in any hotel worldwide but I didn't mind this as much as the fact that this room too was smokey and the bedlinen smelled so strongly of cigarettes I wondered whether they had been washed. The room service menu is small and the food very bland, which is surprising in a country where it is hard to find food that isn't good. Don't stay here if you intend to eat at the hotel. An additional area that seems to have slipped is the car company that the hotel uses. On my recent trip the hotel had, as usual, arranged a car and driver for my meetings. Unfortunately the driver this time was so grumpy that he didn't acknowledge me when I greeted him when I got back into the car between meetings, nor did he bother to open the door. When it started to rain half way through the day I asked if I could take the umbrella lying on the shelf behind my seat. The driver refused to lend me the umbrella saying that \"it was only a short walk to my meeting\". I found this behaviour rather extraordinary, having only ever enountered delightful drivers at other hotels in Europe. Overall, I would inclined to give the Montalembert another chance because I like the rooms (if you're lucky enough to get a good one that doesn't smell of smoke) and location but I do wonder if they are letting things slip. If I have another disappointing stay I will certainly be taking the Montalembert of the company I work for's list of preferred hotels along with my own.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNice boutique hotel with great service\u201d", "Author": "Jack B", "ReviewID": "UR127481638", "Content": "We stayed at the Montalembert for our wedding in Paris during the 1st week of April.

We chose it based on the excellent location, in the heart of the charming, elegant, non-touristy Left Bank. The hotel is in easy walking distance to the Rue de Bac metro, countless memorable restaurants and cafes and an enticing mix of boutiques. Beyond great one-of-a-kind restaurants and shops, in 10 minutes you can be walking across the Seine to the spectacular gardens of the Tuileries and the Louvre. We booked a month in advance online and got a discounted book-ahead rate, meanwhile both the reservation staff and the concierge were very responsive and accommodating of special requests via email. Our room was ready early when we arrived, to our delight our Junior Suite was on the top floor with a view of the Eiffel Tower, absolutely spectacular, especially at night when it lit up and sparkled on the hour. Our room and wash room were spacious and comfortable for two people staying a week, with plenty of closet space and thoughtful amenities like a Nespresso machine for coffee, Babyliss hair-dryer and L'Occitane toiletries. We celebrated a birthday during our stay and they welcomed us with champagne and left thoughtful extras like a mini box of chocolates when our room was made up. Our room was contemporary, elegant and comfortable, in soothing colours of beige, chocolate and deep eggplant, much like the lobby. It's worth mentioning that the bed was extremely comfortable, our room was quiet and the blackout shades made for a great night's sleep. [Other than having coffees upon arrival, we didn't eat at the hotel restaurant or order room service. It wasn't necessary with so many options in the neighborhood, including L'Atelier de Joel Robichon right next door and an excellent patisserie [Eric Kayser] on nearby Rue de Bac. Beyond the rave-worthy location and the quiet luxury of the interior space, what was truly outstanding about our stay was the staff and service. Everyone at the front desk and door was friendly, helpful, gracious and knowledgable, most especially the head concierge extraordinaire, Gilles. He was absolutely brilliant at multi-tasking, anticipating our tastes and making restaurant and sight-seeing suggestions, just the epitomy of professionalism, charm and grace under pressure. All in perfect English. Some of the outstanding restaurants we enjoyed based on his recommendations were nearby Le Restaurant on Rue des Beaux-Arts, Al Dente on Rue de Varenne, and a short cab ride away, Mon Viel Ami, one of the better options open on a Sunday night. We were very happy with our choice and would consider this an ideal home-away-from-home in Paris.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "greenwich, ct", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, lovely entrance, wonderful staff, and then the room.....\u201d", "Author": "Greenwich_CtLcp", "ReviewID": "UR126735577", "Content": "While the owners have worked hard to upgrade the entrance to the hotel, the small sitting and dining area and the lounge area with a warm fireplace - it all ends when you walk into the very tired rooms.

In retrospect, having walked around a fair bit of Paris that weekend, I would argue that the right bank is a better bet - Le Marais was great fun for instance.

This happened on numerous occasions, leading to our being late for the opera and making our departure stressful. The worst was when we were in the lobby on time, saw our cab, asked the doorman only for him to say it wasn't ours.

The salmon with crispy skin was the best I have ever had, bar none. A compote of coarsely mashed potatoes with pistachios took that pedestrian little tuber to a new level. The poached pear with little wings of caramelized sugar and a chocolate \"squiggle\" was so beautiful it was difficult to destroy it. Our waiter suggested a marvelous wine too accompany the meal--pure heaven. Four days later we dined at the Gordon Ramsay at Le Trianon in Versailles and in all honesty the latter meal was not , in my opinion of course, as enjoyable as this one..", "Date": "October 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saratoga, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat little hotel but be aware: the concierge can overcharge you\u201d", "Author": "Simon7382", "ReviewID": "UR80891223", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights.

The rooms are around and above EUR500/night but when you want to have a nice romantic escapade you remain ready to splash. When we arrived the receptionist was very kind and offered us an upgrade to a junior suite (always welcome especially when you don't ask for anything). It was being prepared so they offered us to wait in the lounge. We were about to go to have lunch at the Atelier so they offered us to wait with a complementary glass of champagne suggesting that upon our return our junior suite would be ready. Upon our return a clear example of oversell and under-deliver: they came with some lousy excuses for not offering the junior suite (big disappointment) but even worse was that we got a a twin as opposed to the reserved king size. Poor management. In addition, in the evening we wanted to have something light after sightseeing around Paris (after having had a great ice cream at Berthillon) and it was great to see that for a boutique hotel they had room service. We ordered to macaroni & cheese and a croque monsieur. Please, for the love of god, stop offering room service. It was stale, microwaved and still frozen. Simply disgusting and a real disappointment for a place where the bill is north of EUR1000 for two nights.

This was our second time in Paris (third time in France). We booked our room at the Montalembert with American Express points for a 3-night stay. LOCATION: The Hotel Montalembert is a cozy boutique hotel on the border of the 6th and 7th arrondissements, situated on a side street located off a busy boulevard. One of the greatest things about the Montalembert is its location on the edge of the Left Bank. It's only a short walk to the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, which is my favorite museum in Paris; the Louvre and Tuileries are just across a bridge. The immediate surroundings of the hotel include many antique shops and home furnishings showrooms. Just down the street from the hotel is the taxidermy shop Deyrolle, one of the most eccentric and Parisian shops I have ever seen. For longer sojourns, the closest M\u00e9tro station is Rue du Bac; however, there is only one line that stops at this station, so transfers may be required. THE LOBBY: The small lobby has an understated contemporary treatment to let the original ornate spiral staircase and charmingly tiny elevators shine. THE ROOM: We stayed in Room No. 12, which is a \"deluxe modern\" room (rooms either have contemporary or traditional furniture) located roughly above the lobby on the first floor (American second floor) facing rue Montalembert. The welcome gift was a small box of four exquisite Michel Cluizel chocolates. Room was decently sized and stylish, especially the bathroom (toiletries were L'Occitane, although I'd seen Molton Brown in other promotional photos). There is a large armoire that contains the mini-fridge, safe, and smallish non-HD LCD TV. Wi-fi Internet is available for a fee, but we did not use it. There was construction across the street, but only during business hours (when we were usually out sightseeing). FOOD & SERVICE: The front desk staff speak excellent English and were very welcoming and accommodating. They arranged dinner reservations for us prior to our arrival, which I did via the hotel website's \"contact us\" form. On our last day in Paris, they graciously kept our bags behind the counter while we enjoyed our last afternoon before our train trip to Italy. A concierge also referred us to the nearest English bookstore (FYI: Librarie Galignani, facing the Tuileries) where we could buy an English-Italian phrasebook before we left. We didn't partake of the hotel restaurant, bar, or room service. For a delicious and inexpensive meal, there's a branch of Eric Kayser's excellent boulangeries just up the street. It became our daily ritual to buy something and take it to the Carrousel du Louvre across the Seine and people-watch while picnicking. The Montalembert is also steps away from the famed restaurant L'Atelier de Jo\u00ebl Robuchon, and the caf\u00e9s of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s are about 15 minutes walk to the east.

Much more up-to-date decor than most in the city, but still has some old-world charm. Most important, though, is the location. Practically on Saint-Germain, five minutes from the Musee D'Orsay (and the RER station there), a short walk to Metro stops like Rue du Bac and only a few minutes from the right bank. Also very close to lots of great little restaurants off the busy high street. Specifically I'd recommend the little bistrot on L'Universite, just east of Rue du Bac, and a few places on Verneuil (two streets north) just west of Rue du Bac, most especially Cafe Des Lettres...fantastic back patio. The bad, but probably unavoidable: our room was very small. It is Paris, however, so I expected small, and they're at least smart about how they optimize shelf space, but still...small. There's also a great deal of noise from the street, including the construction site across Montalembert, so if you actually want to keep your window open at all, ask for a room off the street. The view will suck, probably, but you'll have fresh air and a good night's sleep. The bad, and inexcusable: when I booked my room online months ago I specifically asked for a non-smoking room, as I abhor the smell of cigarette smoke. When we got to our room, it was clearly a smoking room...the smell was so overpowering that my eyes watered if I closed the window. Granted, I'm sensitive to smoke, but clearly whoever had been in this room the day before had been smoking. I went downstairs to ask if I could be moved to a different room and the lady at the front desk, Anne, said they were full but she'd see what she could do. She called us a few minutes later and said she could move us up two more floors to a non-smoking room, and someone came for our bags. They let us in the new room and we set our things down. Suddenly, it dawned on us...someone else's things were already here. They'd let us in to SOMEONE ELSE'S ROOM. And it wasn't just that their bags had been placed there...their clothes were unpacked, their complimentary chocolates were opened, they'd used the washroom. We rushed out of there, horrified that the hotel would actually give a key to someone that easily without checking the room status first, making a mental note to religiously use the safe in whatever room we ended up in lest the front desk give out another key to our room. We went back downstairs and explained this. Anne was very apologetic for the whole incident, but told us there was no other option for a non-smoking room and we'd have to spend the night in our original room. She said she'd move us the next day, so we spent that entire day and night with the windows wide open. I'm pretty sure that by any measure this was a major screw-up on the hotel's part, but the next day when they moved us to a non-smoking room we were pretty disappointed. Not only did they not upgrade us -- pretty standard practice for any other hotel I've been which messed up to this degree -- they DOWNgraded us to a smaller room one floor lower, where we got to inhale all the cigarette smoke from people standing outside the front door. Brilliant. At this point we were just too tired to fight anymore. We shook our heads, unpacked and swore never to return. Really, all the hotel had to do to repair things was make a small gesture: move us to a slightly larger room, or comp us a drink at the bar, or waive the 13 Euro fee for the one hour of wi-fi I used...anything. But they never did. We got excited when a bottle of champagne showed up out of the blue, thinking it was an apology, but then we saw the cart delivering champagne to several rooms...it was just standard practice. Even the bar was disappointing...it took us 45 minutes to get a second drink even with only three occupied tables. A few employees, especially Anne, seemed to be trying hard to make up for the terrible start to our stay, but for the most part we felt like second-class citizens during our stay.

Unfortunately what we found was a pretentious, souless hotel which values style over substance and has delusions of grandeur. The service at the hotel was poor. We had booked a table in the hotel's restaurant for a late dinner at 10:15pm after our arrival on the Eurostar on the Friday evening, and had been told by the hotel that this was fine as service finished at 10:30pm. However, on attempting to check-in at the hotel at 9:50pm, we were asked to go straight to the restaurant, rather than checking in and going up to our room to freshen up, as the restaurant staff were waiting to close up. When we walked into the restaurant and bar there was not a person in sight and we were seated at a table in the middle of the empty restaurant. The menu we were given is what we would expect of a room service menu, with the choice of main course consisting of three salads, gazpapacho and a club sandwich. We wouldn't pay 22 euros for a club sandwich or 29 euros for a salad in a nice restaurant in London, never mind in a deserted restaurant in a back street in Paris. Having ascertained that there was nothing we wanted to eat on the limited menu we were given, we decided to leave and go in search of a local restaurant serving regional food. We found many restaurants nearby which were still buzzing at 10.30pm on a Friday night and welcome of our custom. Our room was extremely small and the decor was starting to look tired and tatty. There was very little storage space and there were only two coathangers in the wardrobe. When we asked at reception if we could possibly have any more coathangers we were told that we could not. The room was quite dark and there were no coffee making facilities which would have been nice. We also found a large bug in the bathroom which was quite off-putting! Breakfasts at the hotel were ok, although the tea was as weak as water and the coffee was far too strong, even for French coffee! When we checked out of the hotel on the Sunday morning, we asked if we could leave our bags for the day and collect them before our departure at 7pm. We were told this was fine and the concierge put them to the left of the reception desk in the main lobby and in full view of the hotel's main (glass) door. When we returned to pick them up 7 hours later they were still in the same place, which gave us concerns about the hotel's policy on luggage security. The thing that put us off most about the hotel was the treatment we received from a member of staff on the Sunday as we were leaving. We arrived back at the hotel at around 6pm and, as we had booked a taxi to take us to the station at 7pm, we sat on the terrace at the front of the hotel and had a couple of drinks (we paid 40 euros for four small glasses of wine). At between 6.45 and 6.50pm, the taxi arrived and the waiter came to tell us. We explained that we had booked the taxi for 7pm and would be ready to leave then. When we got into the taxi at 7pm, we noticed that the meter was already at 9.90 euros and we asked the driver to reset it as we had not asked him to arrive 10-15 minutes early and would not be paying for this time. The driver refused, saying that a booking for a certain time means that the customer has to pay for the taxi to be kept free in the 15 minutes before that. At this point the waiter came back and when we explained our problem to him, the waiter said that this is the case with all taxis in Paris (and that taxi drivers in London are kind, which we know not to be the case!). The waiter said that whenever you book or hail a taxi in Paris it will always have a certain amount on the meter and that around 10 euros is usual. We knew this to be untrue as we had got a taxi from the station to the hotel which only had 2.20 euros on the meter when we got in it. As the waiter was telling us this story, we took our bags out of the boot and saw another taxi dropping somebody off down the road. As I started to walk towards the taxi, the waiter ran ahead of me and, after saying something to the driver, said to me \"see, he has 13 euros on his meter, it is perfectly usual\". At this point, we were so disgusted with the waiter's and the taxi driver's behaviour that we started to walk off. The waiter shouted after us that we wouldn't be able to find another taxi with less money on the meter. Needless to say, we walked around the corner and within a couple of minutes had hailed a taxi from the same taxi company as the one we had booked with only 2.20 euros on the meter. We got all the way to the Gare du Nord and left the driver a tip for a total of 10 euros, which is what the driver of the booked taxi wanted before we had even set off. We found the fact that the waiter had told us things that we knew to be untrue and had sided with the taxi driver rather than his paying guests appauling and completely unexcusable. Who knows, maybe he gets a cut of the driver's fares! We felt that he had tried to con us because we were tourists and we are disgusted at the fact that he thought he could get away with it. We have been to Paris several times and we knew that what he was saying was not true. Moreover, the altercation cannot be explained by there being a language barrier as my fiance, who was trying to reason with the waiter, is fluent in French. We have stayed in many hotels across the world which have been both more and less expensive than this one and have never been subject to such appauling treatment by a member of staff.

We stayed in a deluxe room on the 2nd floor that faced the construction in the building across the street. (The noise in our room did not seem to be an issue, and we slept in most mornings until 10:30) The room itself is pretty bare bones/minimalist, but the bed/linens were extremely comfortable. Most hotels located in the left bank are known to be small, so if you know that going in, you will not be disappointed on the size of the room. We knew we wanted to stay in that area and were willing to compromise on that point. That said, the room was definitely not cramped, and I felt we had ample room to move around and get ready. I know some people noted problems with the air conditioning, but we did not have any complaints (and we are people who sleep with the air conditioning on every night, even in the dead of winter in NYC). I found that the service at the hotel to be quite good. Anything that we mentioned to the concierge downstairs was taken care of immediately on our first ask. For example, I mentioned a light bulb had gone out in one of the lamps before leaving for dinner, and it was changed by the time we returned. If we asked for extra towels they were brought to us immediately. Also, thought the turn down service was quite good. Continental breakfast was included in our package, and they delivered it every morning to our room at no extra charge. It was quite nice not to have to rush to get ready to make it downstairs by 10:30am when breakfast ended. The bathroom was clean and all marble, very nice. Only one sink, but we had plenty of room for toiletries on the shelves. The only part that was not great was the shower. It was clean, and fine, but a little bit narrow, and it had practically no door which ended up with a lot of water on the floor. But we found if we just added an extra towel on the floor, it wasn't really an issue. Also, had good products (L'Occtaine). The best part of the hotel is the location. You are a five to ten minute walk to just about everything, and the metro is just a block away. Although we enjoyed our stay and had no complaints, I would want to be very clear to whomever I was recommending this hotel to, as I don't believe it is for everyone. You need to understand that you are paying for your location and if you are looking for a grand lobby, plush, luxuriously decorated rooms with Parisian charm, this is not the hotel for you. But If location if your priority, this is a great place to stay.

We had a little balcony and were actually able to see Bastille Day fireworks at the Eiffel Tower. Service: Well, if we wanted ice, we had to go downstairs, and there were no irons. But service was attentive. Particularly at the front desk. Also, turndown service, which I love. Only bummers: The building across the street - and this means the *entire* facing block - is under construction. Noise started at about 8:30 am, which was no big deal, since we wanted to get up and see the sights. But it was unsightly. And the bathrooms - totally annoying! The shower has only a little half-glass panel so when we took a shower the water went all over the bathroom. So we would have to use the few towels we had to mop up the water.

It's a classic French hotel, without the trouble. Very very clean, lovely chocolates and waters left with the evening turn-down services. The restaurant attached was very nice, perfectly good food and wine menu, though we used the restaurant as a morning launch pad and an evening nightcap spot for the most part. The Hotel Montalembert is on an amazingly quiet little street just off the Blvd. St. Germain, very well located.
