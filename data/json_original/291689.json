{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Old , but charming and historic! We have stayed at the Aida Hotel three times, and it has been pretty nice! Old, yes, it was built in 1912. Close to everything, and it has a great city feel on rooms facing the street. It was fun looking down on the streetcars below! I did not see any bedbugs, and the rooms seemed pretty clean. The shower pressure had a lot to be desired, and the water temperature,fluctuated wildly! Yes, there are some strange people around, but they are everywhere in San Fransisco! Parking garage was a bit spooky, but not over priced.

This is a budget hotel, so don\u9e93t expect hairdryers, fridge etc. It is reasonably clean and safe. The staff is very friendly. San Francisco is a city you need many days. This hotel usually have quite good weekly rates, so ask for a good price on a week or more. Market street is a street full of bums and shady people, but it is a main street so it is ok lit up and not too unsafe. Walk streewise.

I cannot believe Orbitz has this place listed as 3 stars!!!! based on what standards I'd like to know. There are seedy strip clubs around it, bums and sketchy looking people lurking. The good news is, if you're a druggy and you are looking for used needles- look no further than in front of the garage 2 blocks away from the hotel. To add to the fun- they will print your credit card with the expiration date on your receipt and to keep for their own records which are safely kept out of reach from everyone- not!!!!

It is terrible. Area is extremely rundown and full of hoods. A sign inside the office window about $20 per person for a police call-out fee explains alot! They had completely wrong information about our reservation. We ended up in haggle session over a twin hotel room, as they had firstly told us there were none available for the rate we had been given in our reservation, only after threating to stay only 1 night, there was suddenly a room available for the 3 nights that we wanted. This happend to two couples behind us also, i know this, because, as we were waiting inside the elevator in the lobby to take us up to the 3rd floor, the door suddenly started opening and closing, taking us nowhere. Apparently it hadnt been going for a while. I pity those who had to drag their luggage up to the 6th floor. We were also told there was only one room key, so to give it back whenever we went out, we didnt. Although somehow they still managed to get in to change the towels. The room was decent, but not to scratch for what we paid. Towels had yellow stains on them. The area is VERY seedy.

My room was small and was VERY unpleasant to lodge overnight. The towels provided were uncleaned; mine had a hairball and a yellow stain on it. A lot of homeless people and gangsters were hanging outside the hotel at night as well. Aida Hotel also reminds me of one of those scary hostels you see on TV. In conclusion, this is a hotel I will never forget- it continues to haunt me whenever my family plans a vacation. (I don't even think Aida Hotel should even be considered a hotel!!!) FYI: My family and I only stayed at Aida Hotel for one night and stayed at Best Western for the remaining of our vacation (3 nights).

Those are all just things visitors should be prepared for. This hotel is on a less savory street, but none of the people gave us any trouble at all. Once inside, the owners and managers were all very friendly, and when I needed to switch rooms becuase we needed an extra bed, they were completely accomodating. The room was clean, and we had a bathroom that we didn't have to share. The parking situation is less than ideal here, and I wouldn't recomend it for a woman traveling alone (due to the dark garage aspect), but it is secure. If you are looking for a cheap place to spend a night in San Fran without any frills, this is a good bet.

The hotel is in the city but there are so many homeless people day and night, so it's not fun to walk there at alI. I didn't like the atmosphere and the reception desk people. You have to park your car (you have to pay a lot for it) in a carpark at an other hotel. To walk from your car to the hotel is horrible too. The rooms are very old and not very clean and the shared bathrooms are dirty. The next day we left the hotel to stay at a motel at Lombard street, same price but very good, clean and big.

Upon arrival, we were dismayed to find out that the room didnt come with a bathroom. It was cheap but that was it. We had to go to a shared toilet outside the room. What's worse is that the room had a pretty bad smell - as in, it just didnt feel clean. The bed was awful. When we got up, we had bed bug bites all over us. The hotel is close to a nearby disco/pub and the loud music kept us turning and tossing all night. Travellers beware: The price of the room DOES NOT INCLUDE parking for your car. The guy wanted to charge us USD 25 just for leaving our car in his garage. AND get this: the parking garage is TWO blocks away. Imagine this - you are tired and zoned out from driving LV to SF and then lugging your heavy suitcases two blocks to your room. The environment is especially bad.

As downscale as it gets in Frisco - don't be fooled by Aida's location oin Market Street, home of Nordstrom, Bloomingdales and the world-famous SF cable car. This is a bum location. Period.The Aida is right in the heart of 4/5 blocks of homeless people and the associated down side this brings. Filthy streets, urine aromas, bins full of G*d knows what - this is realy disturbing especiallly when you have children in tow (as we did).The hotel is what it is - a cheap, 1-star place to rest your head. Nothing else. No frills although for 5 of us the room was deceptively spacious, clean enough without being too gross and staff were helpful enough - I think they hate the location as much as anyone and behave accordingly.The clientele were international and realy genuinely decent folk. Regular chats in the lobby around a breakfast of do-nuts and coffee were really pleasant.Any web-site that promotes this an okay location in Frisco is mis-leading (as we found out).

As I told the cabbie taking me back to the hotel... (Try getting a cab in SF at 3:30 AM on New Years morning, but that's another story.) Where are you going to get a hotel in SF on New Years Eve for $50?? I only live 100 miles away, so I visit the city from time to time. I had passed by the Aida before, so I had stopped to take a look. Very old, (Probably built in the 20's), but very clean. So, since I was going to the city for NY Eve, I decided to stay there. VERY basic hotel. For an additional $10, you can get a room with bathroom facilities, but I decided to go with the most basic. Both bathroom and shower room were just a few steps down the hall. Both were also very clean. Room was also very basic, with an old TV with a channel DIAL, an old radio that didn't seem to work, a dresser, sink, and medicine cabinet with plastic cups inside. Towels and soap were also provided. The bed was a newer bed, and VERY comfortable, and sleeps two. Mine had only one pillow, so I told the clerk, and he immediately got me another pillow. I slept very comfortably. I didn't take advantage of the continental breakfast. (Coffee and donuts.) The biggest drawback to the hotel is the location at 7th and Market near the Civic Center, which is not the best of neighborhoods. However, the hotel is only a half block from the nearest bart/muni station which will take you anywhere in the city, bay area, or to either SF or Oakland airports. I was only about 5 blocks from my hotel when trying to catch a cab, but I didn't want to walk 5 blocks down Market street at 3:30 in the morning, ESPECIALLY on New Years morning. Great hotel for those on a budget who don't want to Hostel it.
