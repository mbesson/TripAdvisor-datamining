The paint on the walls in the room and the corridor was old. The wardrobe was broken. The view from the balcony was nice and the location is great in Taxim square but other than that there was no advantage in staying there. The breakfast did not have alot of varities and the food did not taste good.", "Date": "October 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "liverpool", "Title": "\u201cgood value, great location\u201d", "Author": "diz23", "ReviewID": "UR20150962", "Content": "Stayed here a few times, both for business and pleasure. Its decent value, and a great location, just off taksim square, and 1 minute to Istiklal st (the Oxford st of Eurpoean Istanbul). Take the Havas bus from the airport to Taksim (9 lira, pay on the bus) and just walk across taksim to find the hotel. Its a little tired looking and old fashioned, certainly no boutique hotel! but if youre just looking for some where decent to sleep then its fine. The breakfast is ok, nothing special, missing it is not a big deal, but the cafe across the road makes a very good fresh orange juice! there is free internet in the lobby, and the staff have always been very helpful. I stay here due to location and price, but feel safe, looked after and its clean. After a late night in the bars around Beyoglu, the hotel is a 10- 15 mins walk home, and the area is safe, especially as you can walk straight up Istiklal st to ge to the hotel, and this st is always busy. Aslo, catch a bus to anywhere from here, or take the metro.", "Date": "September 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "alexandria", "Title": "\u201cnice plce\u201d", "Author": "ayoubms", "ReviewID": "UR12018271", "Content": "It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my first visit to turkey; guess it will be the last. I spent 7 days in that hotel. in general all local hotels there have Luxurious lobby of marble .which is nothing but a beautiful front that hides lot of negatives , so my advice to you is to dig deep : ask for breakfast and how clean is the room , that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the most two important things . In villa hotel the room and the bathroom were always clean, no bad smell, but some mold in thee bathroom and walls painting in not so good. Still it much better than other hotels like keban or golden age. Breakfast was the same during my entire stay. Bakeries were ok. 3 types of cheese .4cold meats. Boiled and omelet eggs. Jam, honey and butter, cereals and juice. That was the daily open buffet. Any how if I would visit Istanbul again I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take the risk to change the hotel and I will stay there again .PS. walk in price is 120$ but through my travel agent I got it for 70$ for double in room on BB bases.", "Date": "December 28, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Villa Suite", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d295481-Reviews-Hotel_Villa_Suite-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$166 - $227*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Siraselviler Caddesi 49</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Taksim</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Istanbul</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">80090</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Turkey</span> (Formerly Dilson Hotel)</span></span></address>", "HotelID": "295481", "ImgURL": "http://www.venere.com/img/hotel/8/5/7/1/111758/111758.jpg"}}
