The host hotel choices were Hyatt, Hilton, and the Hotel Solamar. I chose the Solamar because of the funky decor and the Gaslamp District location. I was not disappointed. I'll start with the location. The hotel is only 2 blocks from Petco Park and 1 block from all that the Gaslamp District has to offer. Additionally, it is only a 5 minute walk to the convention center. If you are headed to San Diego for a convention, this is a much better location to the hotels on the water. If you are going to see a Padres game, you will be in heaven. About the hotel: The door personnel were extremely friendly. The front desk customer service representatives greeted me and checked me in quickly. I even received an upgrade to a nicer room as a Kimpton Rewards member. The room was gorgeous with a large flat-screen TV and beautiful decor on the 9th floor. There was a wine social in the hotel lobby each afternoon which was very nice.

I stayed at Hotel Solamar for a conference taking place at the San Diego Convention Center, which is a pleasant five minute walk from the hotel. The Gaslamp District, which the hotel is located in, is a great shopping and dining center - lots of very trendy and tasty restaurants & cool stores. For convenience, there's a huge CVS just a block away from the hotel. Incredibly, the hotel is also just two blocks away from Petco Park - while we had tickets to an exhibition game one night, I could have easily just watched the scoreboard from my room! Sign up to be a Kimpton Rewards Member before booking your room - lots of benefits offered to me, including a free room upgrade and a small minibar credit. Also, being a member allows you to access their wifi for free, which offered a good reliable internet connection. The staff is exceptionally wonderful - the bellboy greeted me by name the moment I arrived and the front desk was very professional. Because I arrived early, they made it a point to call me to let me know when my room was available. My room was extremely clean with a fully stocked minibar, a super comfy bed, a huge tub with bath salts, and a yoga mat with resistance band. I do echo another visitor's sentiment that the bathroom sink is annoying - it's flat, so water splatters everywhere and it's too high up for a short person like me. (Good) coffee and tea are served every morning, and wine every evening. (I'm told this happens at all Kimptons.) NY Times delivery to the room every morning was a nice touch. The hotel bar was nice - not too loud/crazy, and Brian the bartender was super cool.

After researching areas and hotels we chose the Gaslamp Quarter of the city for it's character and cost as compared to the more expensive hotels on the beach. I had read other reviews of the Solamar and while most were good, I was a bit concerned about the area. Boy was I surprised! What a fabulous location close to everything! The hotel is in great shape with very modern decorating and amenities. The rooms were all updated, clean & comfortable. We were on the 9th floor which I would recommend as it was a non-pet floor. The rooftop pool and bar were absolutely beautiful and I wish I'd had more time to spend there. We went to the hotel restaurant Jsix for breakfast and while they had a very limited menu and it was a bit expensive, the food was excellent. The hotel has a wine hour in their lobby from 5-6 with complimentary wine. We did this both nights we were there. What a nice way to start our evening! We met so many nice people from all over the world. The area was a bit touristy and the restaurants a bit spendy, but it's not anything we didn't expect. The \"barkers\" at the front doors of every restaurant were a bit obnoxious, but the food was delicious and the bars were fun. The hotel valet parking was expensive, but there are much cheaper options conveniently located within a block of the hotel &I didn't mind not parking on site.

We couldn't get a room that was quiet and pet free. Our first room on the 10th floor was under the AC exchange, which made a jet-taking-off noise 24/7. They switched us to an 8th floor room, which had the weird smell of whatever \"natural products\" they use to clean up after the pets, and also happened to be overlooking the pool, where a party was being held. We were told there were no other options. In our first room, my contact case fell under the sink, and I discovered that area quite unclean when I reach under to retrieve it.

Our man of the night, Angel, provided us with exceptional customer service, and made sure each of our accommodations were in perfect order. The rooms are very tastefully done, and the little mini bar in our 7th floor corner room was very reasonably priced. Fifteen dollars for a medium-sized bottle of Ketel.

It created a very sour taste in my mouth that our stay had a $200 surcharge. Second, the location is so near clubs and bars that there is an ever present noise in the rooms. Cars, sirens, loud people....this is near the top floor. The noise goes until at least one in the morning. The last piece that was disappointing is the quality of beds. For the price, the mattresses are junk. You can feel each individual spring. I have never tossed and turned so much for lack of comfort. It's subjective, I know, but for the room rate and parking charges, this place can afford some better mattresses than these. Overall, the rooms are nice though. They're clean and well stocked.

Angel told me about a cool speakeasy-style bar not far away, and Seth gave me extra-late checkout when I really needed it. Usually when you ask for late check out, a hotel's front desk clerk MAY begrudgingly give you until 1 p.m., but Seth gave me until 3:30. My only complaint, and it's a small one, was that on a Thursday afternoon in early February, there was no food service at the pool. (It was a beautiful, warm, sunny afternoon.) Nor was there even a menu available to check, and you couldn't get room service at the pool. I had to go to my room, read the menu (the hotel web site doesn't even offer a menu), call the hotel restaurant, have them call my cell phone when my food was ready, then go down and pick it up.

The sink only had a pump bottle of soap and no other amenities - just a price list of items they sell. I ended up walking down to the nearby CVS drugstore and bought soap.

I was given a room in the 9th floor which was quiet. Contrary to other reviews, I didn't hear any noise from the nearby bars. Did not have time to checkout the pool. We were out from 8AM to 7PM on the days we stayed there and I always found street parking within 2 blocks of the hotel. So you do not have to park in the hotel which will cost you $36/day - same as the other hotels in the vicinity. After longs day in zoo/theme park, the room was a welcome relief. The room was very clean and the bed was comfortable. I'll send a mail to Solamar to get the brand/style of the bed they use and may buy the same bed for my home. The morning coffee / hot chocolate in the lobby was excellent. It was gourmet and way better than the dilute coffee you get in other 4 stars.

Top notch, very friendly, quick and helpful. Roof top lounge-was perfect with a pool, modern style decor consisting of fire pits, heat lamps, multiple cabanas, out door fire place, tables, couches, a great view of the gas lamp district below, out door shower (out of public view) to rinse after pool use, with a nice bar as well. Hotel lobby/lounge-VERY NICE, Beautifully done with with fire place, couches, chairs. A nice touch is the free wine hour from 5-6pm!! Be there about 5-minutes early to get a great place to sit, relax an enjoy your wine :). We had the Chilean Cab!!! Very good!! This place was pet friendly as well!! Perfect if you plan to bring your dog!! The Room was styled nice and cozy with comfortable beds and nice cushy sized chair!!. We had a room on the 6th floor over looking the pool and really enjoyed the view. Best of all was the location of this hotel to fine dining and all of what the Gas Lamp has to offer. You do not need your car if you only plan to visit nearby Seaport Village, Convention Center or the Gas Lamp district. The 2 Cons: First was the parking/vallet prices at $40/night. You do get in/out privileges at no extra charge though if you plan on using your car. We didn't use our car and parked right across the street for $25/night which was very convenient!! The other con was the walls and doors were so thin (maybe just our room) you could hear EVERYTHING including crying-barking dogs, people talking etc.out in the Hallway as well as the room next to ours. Security was very quick wonderful at quieting guest that were loud and disturbing others. So needless to say I had horrible sleep the first night and my Wife did the second night.

There's a really nice park close by at Petco Stadium. Dogs are allowed there and there is security walking around. Also, enjoyed taking the dogs to the Gaslamp district where we had lunch. We were able to tie them to the railing in the outdoor patio of the restaurant so the dogs could be with us. Had great food at La Fiesta (Mexican Cruisine and Lounge) and also at the Italian restaurant connected with it. One restaurant down. The hotel is really comfortable and give nice comfortable beds for the dogs which also match the decor of the room. Also furnished doggie food/water dishes and lots of tasty treats - a whole assortment of them. Loved the welcome VIP pet signs. Enjoyed seeing all the names of the pets staying there. Also, found the staff to be really friendly, customer focused and all seemed to love the pets too. You can tell the staff love working there. This is the third Kimpton hotel we have stayed at and we loved it. Love the out of the box ideas the hotel has like providing a goldfish for those who miss there pets, late checkout on Sundays, no parking fees for hybrid cars, etc. Kimpton hotels stand out from the rest. Oh! and they don't charge pet fees. Incredible. Another nice touch which was a surprise was that on Christmas day, since the restaurant was closed, they provided all the guests a complimentary continental breakfast. Really enjoyed it and got to meet some of the other guests while eating near the fireplace. Felt at home there and am looking forward to returning. Only wish there were more Kimpton hotels all over the place. Would always stay there if there was.

The rooms are nice and the beds are comfortable, but the rooms are just average sized and they don't have suites, so if you like a bigger room to lounge-around in you might think that the rooms are not big enough. The staff is very friendly and professional, and of course the location is what makes this hotel so appealing. The prices at the Solamar can be quite high sometimes, so if you are just looking for a decent place in the Gaslamp district I would recommend checking out the many Hilton and Marriott hotels also located throughout the Gaslamp, because they often have much better prices. Hotel prices in San Diego fluctuate *dramatically* depending on the time of year, tourist season, and when the city is less full vs. the times it gets booked-up due to a large convention or major sporting event, so if the timing of your trip is flexible and the prices seem surprisingly high you might want to check the hotel prices for different possible times that work for you. The Solamar has a wine hour every evening, which is a nice thing to offer, and the wine was fine, but there wasn't quite enough room for all of the people so it was a little on the crowded side, and they shut that wine bar down the very second the scheduled hour is over. They also have a rooftop bar at night, out where the pool is, and we were looking forward to enjoying a drink there at the end of our day, but it was definitely not our scene - it was crowded with people in their 20's, dressed to get attention, dramatic and flirty, and the music they had was loud pumping club music. It was interesting people watching, but it was not our thing so we left after one quick drink. If you like a trendy place, in a great location, and might enjoy the club scene at their rooftop bar this would be a great place for you. If you are just looking for a nice clean place right in the middle of the Gaslamp district this can be a great choice, except for the fact that at times the prices at the Solamar are much higher than the other perfectly nice standard hotels nearby. If you are looking for a hotel with suite or a really big room, and you plan to spend a significant part of your day in your room I would not recommend the Solamar.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cAlways a great time\u201d", "Author": "HankHenry", "ReviewID": "UR121503725", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here for a staycation while we went out to the gaslamp with friends, since its just walking distance from restruants and bars.

My one \"gripe\" was the outrageous cost of parking a car. At $35 per night I felt it was pratically extortion! It cost me less to rent the car for 4 days than to park it. This is not an inexpensive hotel in terms of room costs, so to charge that kind of a fee was really an insult. They are located in a very busy area so maybe they feel they can get it. However, those not staying there certainly have other, cheaper, short term parking options. They retrieved my car VERY quickly whenever I needed it (maybe mine was the only one down there).

I often joked with my wife that I felt like I could walk up to the front desk and ask for anything and my wish would be granted. First of all, the room: Perfect. We asked for a \"quiet\" room, an absolute must in this hotel. There are rooms facing the pool which will keep you up nights. y asking for a \"quiet room\" you will not have this problem. Our room faced the Gaslamp area, there was a nightclub across the street, but the room had some type of sound insulation so I didn't really hear any music from the outdoor nightclub. The bed was great, comfy chairs, and a minibar fridge I kept food in without any trouble. The pool area is fantastic. Every day I sat at the pool in a free cabana, read the paper, a book, or used the free internet service. At times I was alone at the pool, enjoying a drink or just cold water. There is a pool waitress but she doesn't bug you. At 5 pm everyday they have free wine. I usually got a glass, brought it to my room, and saved it for my wife, who was at a convention till 6 or 7 pm. One night she arrived at the wine tasting at 6:05 pm, they had closed, so the desk gave her coupons for 2 free glasses at the restaurant. THe service aspect is extraordinaire! I went to a number of amazing restaurants in San DIego (including the hotel's). A few times I brought back leftovers. The next day, I went to the front desk, I asked them to \"warm up\" the leftovers, and a few minutes later I was handed back the food on a tray with fine china, with utensils and a glass of ice water, all for free! The hotel is in an absolutely perfect spot, near the waterfront, the convention center, Petco Park, and about 300 restaurants in the gas-lamp. It is convenient to use public transportation to get to the zoo, Balboa park, or Seaworld. We liked the Solamar so much, when our trip was supposed to end, I went to the front desk and inquired about extending our stay for 2 extra days. The manager let us stay in the same room, and gave us a discounted rate due to our loyalty. I will stay at Kimpton hotels from now on and the Solamar whenever I return to San DIego.

Cons: The modern bathroom sink has a high faucet and shallow sink, which means that water will ALWAYS splash on you/your clothes; The sink counter is simply too high for shorter people (I am 5'3\") so it's very hard to use; The room had a musty smell; There is no coffee maker in the room - only in the lobby - so if you need coffee before you face people for the day, you're out of luck; The room could really use more lights; No dresser (but large closet); Not enough staff at the pool bar/restaurant so you have to wait a long time to get served.", "Date": "October 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay and what a great location!!!!\u201d", "Author": "jennifer L", "ReviewID": "UR119841582", "Content": "What a wonderful hotel!

When we were finally hungry and ready to hit the city, we met Angel at the front desk who spent so much time giving us fantastic food and fun ideas! He suggested a budget friendly lunch spot and recommended taking it to go so we could have a romantic picnic in the baseball park!!

The front desk staff were helpful and polite. The room its self was massive. It was clean and spacious. There was wine tasting every night. The only down side to the hotel is the noise from the pool area. I'm not talking about during the day, but the night. On a Friday and Saturday night it can really kick off down there. We were on the 7th floor overlooking the pool and it was very noisy with loud music, people yelling and screaming ect...however we were aware this was going to be an issue after reading all the other posts on trip advisor and accepted it. If you have small kids or hate noise you may want to request a room that doesn't overlook the pool.

Overall, we were very pleased with our stay. The hotel is clean and well-appointed. Although I was initially a bit skeptical about its location upon pulling up to the hotel (it faces a not-so-attractive parking lot), I quickly changed my mind. It's a short walk to all major attractions in the Gaslamp quarter... something that comes in very handy when you're pulling along two small kids. Our room wasn't ready until well past check-in time, which was initially annoying. Luckily, my mother-in-law's room was ready to go so we had somewhere to relax while we waited. We stayed in a King suite that faced Petco stadium, and my mother-in-law stayed in a King room facing the pool. The King suite was phenomenal for a family - there were large flat screens and DVD players in both the bedroom and in the adjoining room where the kids stayed. Although our suite was very quiet, my mother-in-law commented that her room was noisy at night. Although there was a wedding at the hotel that night, the noise issue seems to arise fairly frequently based on past TripAdvisor reviews. If we return, I will be sure to request a room on the quiet side of the hotel to avoid the noise issue. The pool area was well-appointed and had a hip, twenty-something vibe. Fortunately for my pool-loving kids, they always felt welcome and there were often other kids swimming along with them in the pool. It was a great place to relax at the end of a busy day. We also loved the free wine reception each evening - a great feature. The biggest standout out about this hotel was the employees - they were phenomenal. The front desk was always there to help, and they were great at giving us tips for family-friendly restaurants in the area (definitely try the Broken Yolk cafe a block away for breakfast - but get there early on the weekend if you want to avoid a wait). The valet guys were particularly exceptional - incredibly friendly and helpful. One day, my four year-old daughter was skipping up the front walkway back into the hotel. One of the valets saw her, came out from behind the desk and skipped with her to the front door to open it for her - it made her (and my) day. Great guys.

Though i had to wait for my room, when i received my room at 3pm it was spotless and tidy as usual. This is what one should expect from a 4.5-5 star hotel. The lobby of this hotel is amazing. Rich woods, comfortable chairs and sofas, it felt like home or better. There was free water and spritzers in the lobby, which was refreshing in the San Diego summer heat. However, the hotel lobby and rooms are well air-conditioned, making the Solamar a welcoming oasis from normal life. Katie or Kelsie (i think that was her name) was the nicest hotel clerk i've ever met. These people here will do whatever it takes to make your stay top-notch, leaving nothing to chance. I got to stay in the Master Suite this time, and it was worth every penny. Spa tub next to a window, just when does a hotel have that? The Suites could be larger but the price is already at a value. Affordable, not inexpensive but not expensive at all, considering the total package received. I'm a Kimpton In-Touch member and they give you $10 in room service snacks (it's called the \"Honor Bar\") so i always deduct $10 from the room price. These gestures by the hotel are nice, and nice needs to always be recognized. I totally recommend this Kimpton above all other Kimptons (although i recommend those too that i've stayed at), and definitely over 99% of all other hotels i've stayed at. The beds are super comfy, everything spotless and chic in the hotel, and there is not a single thing i can find wrong with anything the entire time during both my stays.

When I was checking in, my wife took my daughter to the lobby bathroom and there were 2 young women cleaning up and getting dressed for the day. Really? Either they walked in off the street or they got kicked out of their room and had no where else to get ready. And when I checked in I was told that because of the holiday the pool was for guests only. Again, really? Does that mean the pool is open to the public the rest of the time? Based on other reviews I was expecting the greatest customer service but in reality it was on par for any good hotel. And a cheap dollar store toy does not make it kid friendly. When I got there the bell/valet crew where helpful maybe a little over eager but nice. Check in was easy but room was not ready at 1:45 so they took my number and said they would call me. No call as of 3:00 so we walked back and as I standing in line I got the phone call (appx 3:15). I was told they were sold out so I could not get a room with 2 beds like I needed. I asked for a roll away and top floor which they gave me. Valet parking $36 a night. Directly across the street $25 for overnight parking. Room was clean but not very big and not very practicable and the roll away was waiting in the room for me. Honor bar not a smart idea with younger children who will be tempted. Bathroom small and also not practicable with a raised sink which makes it impossible to wash your face without having water go everywhere and again not kid friendly. My biggest problem was with the pool area. The area is so tiny pool super small no chairs pool super heated. I felt like I was at the Hard Rock or a frat party with all the 20 something drunk barely clothed people there having conversations how they had sex they night before. Kid friendly? Not so much. And while the guests did not seem to mind my kids there it is not a proper environment for ANY kid no matter age. Staff (security) seemed to be there to hook up with the guests.

Bed slept wonderful and everything was super clean. Outside our window we could see Petco Park to the right. The one problem we had with this room was the TV signal kept going out. We called the front desk and they sent someone up right then to check on it and said it couldn't be fixed, it was just a bad reception in that room. So after four days of the TV going off in the middle of a program, I asked the front desk to move us. Which they did, but to another King Room, (1027) not a suite. They didn't have another King Pet Free Suite availiable for us. We asked for a Pet Free room when we made reservations at the Solamar and found out that the top two floors at this hotel are Pet Free. And there is only one King Suites on each of these two floors. Anyway, the King Room that they moved us too was just as nice and have a view of the pool area. And yes, the TV worked great. They also discounted our last two night there because of the TV problem. We are really picky about where we stay and we felt the Hotel Solamar meet all our needs.

In JSix we have had outstanding Waitstaff. Thanks to Kristen, Josie and Jamie who ensured that our meals and service were memorable! We should mention that JSix has 1/2 price wine on Wednesday nights. What a deal! We had a bottle of Deutz Blanc de Blanc champagne!! What a bargain plus we rec'd 20% off our bill because we had had breakfast in the restaurant that morning! All in all - amazing food, delicious wine and outstanding service. We have no hesitation in recommending JSix as a dining venue for a romantic dinner (plus breakfasts are delicious!)

We were a little concerned about the \"pet friendly\" aspect of the hotel as my husband has allergies but we mentioned this when booking and there were no problems. Apparently, there are floors reserved for humans only and we certainly didn't see any traces of pets in our room, it was spotlessly clean. In fact it was quite amusing to see a cat being led around the lobby on a lead!! Our room on the 10th floor was very nice with a great view of San Diego. The bathroom was lovely but the design of the sink did tend to mean everything around it got wet, it looked very nice though! I would definitely recommend joining the Kimpton In Touch loyalty program as it gives you free wifi and a $10 minibar credit. We were reminded of these freebies and the wine hour when we checked in which was a nice touch. The only criticism we had of the hotel was the parking. It is $35 per night, valet only. The thing that really annoyed us about this was the signs outside offering all day (8hrs) parking to the general public for $10, this adds up to $30 for 24 hours which is cheaper than the rate the hotel guests are paying!! We overcame this by parking in the lot across the street (which we could see from our room) for $25 per night, they were also happy to provide in/out passes for 24 hours. Overall, the Solamar is a great hotel in a very good location, we would definitely stay there again if we return to San Diego, but we would continue to park across the street!", "Date": "May 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ireland", "Title": "\u201csplendid Solamar\u201d", "Author": "kate055", "ReviewID": "UR107385240", "Content": "We spent a week here over Easter we have stayed in Kimptons before but this is the best so far many thanks to the wonderful Wendy and ever helpful Patrick on reception they were so nice.

Free coffee and hot water for tea was available every morning near the front desk, plus an assortment of complimentary newspapers. Nice touch ! The hotel is located in the heart of San Diego's Gas Lamp district which offers a plethora of restaurants and retail stores. Although the Solamar has a restaurant, I would rate the food as average. We stopped in after an evening baseball game hoping for good snacking food, such as burgers, wings, etc. but the menu offerings were slim. The restaurant's bar offers plenty of seating, but prices are a little high. Better to stop into the 7/11 a couple of blocks away... or the corner liquor store to get your adult beverages. Other than being disappointed because of a lack of cuisine variety, my only other negative is the hotel's fitness center...three treadmills, a rack of dumbell weights and a couple of exercise mats. Woefully lacking, for those of us who enjoy a good workout while on vacation.

There's also a bar on the sun deck, which was convenient and fun. If you are going to a Padre's game or want to stay in the fun Gaslamp area, I highly recommend the Solamar. The beds were also very comfortable. The wine reception looked fun as well and I noticed they were serving some appetizers too. We didn't get to stay for it or taste the wine, but many guests seemed to be enjoying themselves.

I booked online under the Sun and Sea internet special which gave me $30 to spend anywhere in the Hotel ranging from in-suite dining/room service to valet parking. As a Kimpton In-Touch member (sign up is Free), i also received a $10 credit to the \"Honor Bar\" which is the snack and mini-fridge menu. Coming from San Francisco, it was a long drive. I was met by very courteous and attentive valet parking staff. After tipping the valet to take care of my car $5, i was assisted by the bell hop Garrett, who was very friendly and polite. A nice gal name Katie, who had greeted me and checked me in at the Front Desk, had fulfilled by request for a Corner Spa Suite, which when Garrett and i had unloaded my things at the room, was an excellent Corner Unit to say the least. After tipping Garrett $5 for his kind and professional help, I took a tour of the unit. The views were 180 degrees, 9 floors up (10 floors total in this Kimpton) and excellent looking into Petco Park, where the San Diego Padres play home games. There was a roar from the crowds as i was unpacking, as someone from the Padres had just hit a homerun after the 7th inning stretch. Of course, if you could imagine, there were bars around the park next to the Kimpton. There was the Fleetwood and the Bub, right outside the corner suite where you could look down and see the patrons. So if you want a quiet room, either close the windows (you couldn't hear any noise if you shut the windows of this unit and used the A/C) or request a Corner Suite on the other side of the hall. The Corner Suite was spacious and richly appointed. There was a nice, big soaking tub, which was jetted as well. I actually used this Spa jet tub at the end of the night and it just put me to sleep right after. One of the best sleeps i'd enjoyed in a long time. The reason: the beds. These beds like most Kimptons are the most enjoyable beds to sleep on. They are just the right amount of firmness and super clean and fresh smelling. There was a HDTV LCD for viewing enjoyment, a DVD player, liquers available, wine, champagne, Organic cookies, nuts, etc. These Kimptons are inviting and well-thought out. Efficient. Value. Superb service and hospitality at the right value-oriented price point. At least that is the impression i get every time i book and leave a Kimpton. I leave feeling i got a good deal, a wonderful experience, and wanting to book again anytime i'm in a City that has a Kimpton. In fact, that's what i do these days. The Hotel Solamar is one of the most luxurious Kimptons i've booked. The lobby is just spectacular. As with every Kimpton i've stayed at, there was a wine reception hour from 5-6pm. This reception at the Solamar was superb as usual. My female counterpart was extremely delighted. I wholeheartedly recommend yet another Kimpton. The Kimpton Solamar's staff will impress, and once you see the interior decor and stay in the comfortable rooms you will wonder why you only had to pay so little for all of it. By far, of any other hotel chain i've stayed at, the best pound-for-pound all-around deal for its price. These Kimptons are going to devour other hotel chains in this Recession. They will come out of this Recession as a top hotel chain, and to be perfect honest, i think they deserve to me. This benchmark of excellence should apply to all hotels.

Not only did they ignore my note but they didn't leave anything the 2nd day. There was dust on the lamp base, the bed was not smoothed out and pillows were not refreshed. Housekeeping didn't hang up the robe, and the side table top was crooked for the entire stay. * No concierge service - must wait for Front Desk to ask about restaurants, sightseeing, etc * No turn-down service * Wine reception served a low quality Cabernet (can't comment on the white wine option) * No airport shuttle service. Other notes: on our check-in, we entered the elevator with one gentleman already on it. Before we reached our floor, he slumped over, hit his head on the rail. I am certain that he had a stroke. At our floor (5), I kept the elevator open and my husband went to find help. I repeatedly pushed the emergency button on the elevator but no help arrived. A housekeeping staff arrived and took the man down and when we asked later, the Front Desk employee made light of the situation and I found out that an ambulance was not called to attend. It was very traumatic for my 9-year old and he refused to take the elevator after that - thank goodness we were only on the 5th floor. The hotel doesn't know what it wants to be. The room decor was a mix of shabby chic, spa fresh and other design elements. It didn't go together. The hotel feels like it wants to be a 4-star but with the lack of service, it is really just a 3-star with a 4/5 star price.

This is our first stay in a \"trendy\" hotel and while it's not our thing (we perfer historic/old skool hotels) it was a very nice treat. The downside: You'll have to either order room service for coffee ($5 for a cup) or get your own in the lobby as there is NO in-room coffee pot -a shame for paying $300 a night. The couch was uncomfortable, and there is a $35 per night validated car park. Although the bathroom was outstanding and had the best view of the city, the mirror had streaks on it and the shower is in need of a good scrubdown as it was very slippery.

I feel that this will be a more helpful review if I just go through the list. Cleanliness- 5/5 Our room was spotless, and although Hotel Solamar is pet friendly, they do have floors that are entirely pet free. I love both options. My fiance loved the room at Solamar compared our room in Huntington Beach (non-Kimpton hotel, but in the same class), he felt like the design was better, and he even mentioned that the grout was clean in the Solamar bathroom vs HB. Location- 5/5 Located in the Gaslamp Quarter, its a short walk to everything- coffee, food, shopping. The restaurants are a plenty here and Petco park (Padres) are just 2 blocks away. It was far enough to not have to deal with listening to the party all night long, but close enough to walk to the party and walk back. Rooms- 5/5 I touched on this a little bit reviewing cleanliness, our room was spacious, comfortable. Our pillows were amazing and the comforter on the bed had the perfect balance of weight and warmth. I didn't touch the thermostat once. (I stayed in Huntington Beach for 2 nights prior to staying at Hotel Solamar for 2 nights, and the room was a sweat box walking in, but turned into an ice box if you turned on the a/c.) Our shower was nice and pressurized so I could wash the shampoo and conditioner out- very important for the ladies out there. Service- 6/5 Here is where I normally don't expect to have my expectations exceeded. Hotel Solamar staff goes beyond doing their job right, they want to make sure you're happy. Quick good service, helping out others when they are short handed- they care about their job and they care about the hotel, which shows through. I have many stories from my 2 night stay, but I'll just post one(below) and I am a nobody- just a regular Joe schmoe, staying at Hotel Solamar. <I called down for room service at peak time (6:30pm on a Friday night). The phone rang less than 5 times, and the front desk picked it up to let me know the kitchen would have to call me back, they were busy. I figured I'd just call down again in 10 mins or so. Before I could, I did receive a call back, and it was the front desk again. The in-room dining services was busy, but the front desk person offered to take my order and see if he could get it in for me, otherwise he'd have them call me. It felt less than 5 mins, I had a knock on the door. It was room service with my order! I couldn't believe I never had to talk to the in-dining services team once, and I got my order.> It was delicious by the way- I picked their seasonal vegetable ravioli- very good. Value- 6/5 I made my reservations on the Kimpton website- they were offering special pricing, I booked 2 nights for ~$110. Valet parking was $35/day w/in & out privileges, daily for $15. Parking across the street in the lot was $15/daytime, $15/night-time, no in & out, have to pay every 12 hours. I picked valet at the hotel. Sleep Quality- 5/5 I touched on this in the room review above, but the bed was very comfortable, pillows and comforter was perfect. I felt the key is having a good HVAC system, so the room is not too cold/warm- what I appreciated was it didn't blow directly on me/the bed when the fan auto turned on. I hope you travelers out there choose this hotel for your San Diego stay. JSix is a great restaurant, and I wish I could have tried more dishes, but I didn't have enough time.

Sadly, I must put the San Diego Solamar in the \"lower standard\" category. Maybe it was nicer a few years ago when it was newer; but, it's in decline now. A few positives: central location; coffee in the morning; wine in the early evening; free NY Times (even Sunday edition); outdoor patio; good wireless reception throughout building; nice enough front-desk staff. Now for the not-so-positive: the mattresses are old and need replacement (or flipping): there are large indentations from where people have slept. The rooms are spare: perhaps this isn't much of an issue except that Kimpton touts itself as being stylish--hotel pictures show a lovely room with pillow shams and blanket throws but, the rooms no longer contain these items. Also, cabinet doors didn't close properly because the hinges were loose and worn. The carpet leading into the room was bare and torn. These small things contributed to an overall feeling of decline; maybe the room was pretty nice five years ago but now it seems a little bit shabby. Another negative: I'm a Kimpton InTouch member and the paper wasn't delivered to my door. Again, this is a small thing but 1) this is a service that Kimpton touts and 2) small things like this add up to a general sense of dissatisfaction. All in all, I would not put the Solamar into the category of two stars, but it seems to be slipping into it. Kimpton needs to put this hotel onto the list of \"hotels to refurbish\".", "Date": "January 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cOne of the Best Hotel Experiences Ever\u201d", "Author": "Rockinrodd", "ReviewID": "UR92130288", "Content": "We had the most amazing experience at this hotel.

We stayed over New Year's wtih our little kids. The location is great - in the heart of the Gas Lamp district and close to the convention center and many restaurants. I have never had more friendly/helpful valets and hotel staff at a hotel as I have experienced during this stay. The rooms were comfortable and decently sized. Valet parking was $35 per day - so we instead parked further down the street at an ACE parking garage which worked well and cost $17 per day. The hotel had great coffee in the lobby each morning and we absolutely loved the wine hour (each night between 5 and 6pm). We asked for a quiet room - and ended up on the 8th floor. The pool deck was really loud over new year's eve from the party there - but we expected that. The hotel staff were great for restaurant recommendations. We ate at the Tin Fish - good fish and chips. Broken Yolk - excellent breakfast - right next to the hotel - we highly recommend this place (I think it was even featured on Man vs. Food. Rockin Baja Lobster restaurant - awful food and service - but loud enough to have to eat there with our kids. Joe's Crab Shack - was fine. Saffron - (on India street) excellent Thai takeaway - especially the grilled Thai chicken - great if you have a car. A few cons though: 1) Expensive valet fees 2) The room smelled a little funny. 3) My wife's allergies acted up during our stay - prob because this is a very pet friendly hotel. After some claritin, she was fine though. 4) No locks on the bathroom doors - I don't get this. Is this a boutique hotel thing?

The hotel had some nice guest perks like free coffee and chai tea bar in the morning, free afternoon hot chocolate bar, free evening wine reception. My room was spacious, very clean and nicely decorated with touches that were inspired by the locale. As a Kimpton InTouch member, I was treated very well. Prior to my arrival I received an email from someone on guest relations saying they were looking forward to my stay and asking if I needed anything prior to arrival. There was a note from the hotel in my room offering me $10 to raid the mini bar. I even got a hand written note from the cleaning woman. I ate in the hotel's outdoor bar/lounge on my first night and the food and cocktails were great. I even got a huge discount on my food by checking in on Foursquare. I used the gym 3 out of the 4 days I was there and it was clean. My only complaint is that the temperature in the gym was very hot. Also on one of the nights, it was loud late into the night and I couldn't tell if it was a guest in an adjacent room or people in the outdoor pool/bar area. I eventually fell asleep so it wasn't a huge deal. Also if you are a dog lover, you will love this hotel but more importantly if you are not, like me, you will still enjoy your experience. When I first checked in it was around the time of their daily dog happy hour and there were dogs all over the lobby area. I immediately was turned off as I am not a dog person but the manager assured me I was on a pet-free floor and that the dog happy hour is only a short time in the afternoon. Since I left the hotel in the morning for work and didn't come back until the early evening, it never became an issue as I never did see another dog. Overall I loved the hotel and will definitely stay there when I return to San Diego for another trip, and I will of course keep staying at Kimpton hotels whenever possible.

It was only a minor inconvenience as our room was ready within 30 minutes or so. The room itself was a good size with 2 TVs, $10 mini bar credit as a result of being an in Touch member. Nice bathroom with jacuzzi bath and really big comfortable bed. Kimpton have a free wine hour with canapes at 5pm and this was a really nice touch as we got free wine which is always good but also gave you an opportunity to chat to other guests.

We even found a secret bar, Vin de Syrah, which was recommended to us by one of the other guests during wine hour which was a really cool place. We had breakfast at the broken yolk cafe which was a few doors down, amazing portions and good tasty food, although service was a bit slow. We had dinner in the Royal Thai Restaurant on 5th Avenue which was really good. Would also recommend the zoo if you have time, we had a couple of hours in the morning and went to see the pandas but you could spend all day there, great zoo and beautiful location and surroundings. Would thoroughly recommend the Solamar as a great place to stay for the service and location which are both excellent.

I had arranged this stay for a group of my friends and family who were travelling together and I really liked the fun, yet sophisticated and stylish look of the hotel from pictures I had seen online. It was our arrival at the the hotel that I feel disappointed me most. We were a group of 8 persons checking-in at around 3pm in the afternoon - I had sent an email to the hotel advising them 2 members of our group were members of the Kimpton In Touch program and I had advised their membership numbers. It was evident the membership numbers were not in our reservations upon check-in, even though I had sent the email 2 weeks prior. My sister enquired about arranging a massage while we were checking in and the person at the desk suggested she join the Kimpton In Touch program to gain a discount? My sister was one of the persons in our group who I had advised the hotel was already a member! After being allocated our rooms I went up to mine. I called reception when I got inside as I had wanted a room with a walk-in shower rather than a shower over the bath. The person I spoke to, who was the same person that checked me in said that they could move me and my partner and advised I bring all our bags down to reception where they would give me the key to our new room. I double checked with them they could move us, as my partner was dropping off our rental car and I was going to have to move all the luggage back down stairs myself to change rooms, the person confirmed yes I was to do this. When I got down stairs the person who I was speaking with on the phone was with another guest and I told their colleague what I was advised. I immediately felt as though this request to change rooms was unreasonable, there was some huffing and they checked on the system where they could move me too. After a couple of minutes they advised there was no other room to move me to - it had already been allocated. I said can you please check with your colleague as they had confirmed there was another room just 5 minutes ago. The person I was dealing with advised me again there was no other room. At this point I was annoyed, but thanked them for their assistance and went back up to my original room. When my partner got back I told him what had happened and he called down to reception, he asked to speak with the manager and was told sorry the manager is on vacation at the moment? We were confused a hotel of this standard had nobody in charge while the manager was on vacation? Generally this hotel is attractive and nicely decorated. The service like in many \"trendy\" boutique hotels, lets it down though. I have stayed in Kimpton hotels prior to this stay at the Solamar and had had better experiences than this.

We were able to find free parking at parking meters around the hotel every night except for Saturday when the nightlife in the district was very busy. After being stuck in traffic and circling around for a couple times, we ended up parking in a parking lot several blocks away for $15 overnight.

All within close driving distance. Farthest we had to drive to the destination was probably 40 mins. We liked the ambiance and interior design and layout of the hotel. However, we were disappointed with the service. The housekeeper did not do a good job with keeping up with supplies in the room. Everyday, there was something missing: it was either toilet paper, or lotion, or other random things. When we did ask for the supply, it would take a long time for the items to arrive to our room. It also seems like they didn't put much effort making the bed. Apparently the hotel maid did not like re-arranging the pillows; the pillows were left at the corner of the bed every day when we returned to hotel. I guess the maid just didn't bother putting that finishing touch. The nice part of the hotel is that there's complimentary coffee and tea everyday in the lobby. However, the staff who's responsible for maintaining the station looked like she was about to kill someone. It wasn't hard to tell she hated her job. When I was at the station making my tea, I guess I was in her way and she just stood there staring at me with an attitude. I looked back and asked if I was in her way, she just said no and went away to do something else... Pretty unusual experience for a hotel with this star rating.

The Hotel and the room itself were fantastic and the quality and cleanness of the room were top quality and couldn't be faulted, we had a bottle of champagne and a happy birthday card???? Which magically later in the day to a Comgratulations card! Which was a nice touch. One of the first things we did find however was that the safe didn't work, which with our passports and cash etc we sure needed. Reported on the phone and were told we could go out and Maintence would repair, that evening when got back it still wasn't fixed, so called again in the morning to ask again and when still not repaired that evening asked reception for 3rd time. Still wasn't repaired so gave up asking!! wine hour was a nice touch, was served most evenings by a lady from the phillipenes who was lovely whenever we saw her, unfortunately on the Tuesday after a long day at the Zoo, there was a older blonde lady serving who was simply Rude and was possible the rudest person we came across, at first we thought she disliked us for bring a younger crowd, however when speaking to other guests in the lift we weren't the only people to notice this. The pool area itself was lovely and offered lovely views over the Gaslamp, unfortunately service wasn't much better when we did visit with the barman being more interested in the baseball game on, than any customers. finally when we did get home to the uk, we checked our credit card statement to find we'd been double billed for our stay, so after long call trying to get someone to help from within the hotel a voicemail was left and the problem that should never happen was resolved quickly. Overall we lovely San Diego, the Hotel we loved and the rooms were lovely, the Valet staff were friendly and the cleaning staff very nice but unfortunately too much poor customer service soured our visit.

We were looking forward to staying at The Solamar in San Diego while visiting family and were especially appreciative of Kimpton's marketing efforts and special programs for GLBT visitors. The chain is to be applauded for that. This specific hotel, though, was a bit of a disappointment. Like a previous reviewer noted, some of the disappointments were minor (most were, actually) and some were down-right frustrating for a hotel of this quality. Valet parking anywhere in a major metropolitan area is expensive. We did gulp a bit at the $35/night valet rate. In general valet attendants were efficient and friendly. A couple, however, were abrupt with comments like, \"Call earlier. It'll be 15-20 minutes before we can get your car.\" During the time we stayed at the Solamar the property appeared to be at capacity, yet they were down to just one elevator. This created incredible lines for the lift in the lobby and on each floor of the hotel ... day and night. When we inquired about the location of the stairway, we were given a vague response. We finally found the stairway, but kind of shook our heads at the lack of attention to service. As many have noted, the pool area is superb. It was fun to hang out there on a Friday night, people watch, enjoy a cocktail, and enjoy the sunshine. Again, some staff members were friendly and professional, others were surly or aloof. Our king guest room was on the smallish side, but the most concerning piece of the room itself was the incredibly uncomfortable bed. I spend about 70% of my time on the road and am very accustomed to lots of variation in hotel bedding. This was the worst bed I've had in months and reminded me of beds I encounter when I'm stuck in motel in some small berg in the middle of nowhere. It sagged tremendously on the sides, provided no support, and produced a very uncomfortable night's sleep for both of us. The lack of bath soap, etc in the bathroom didn't bother us. In fact, I appreciate that the hotel uses pump shampoo, conditioner, and body wash instead of individual soaps and bottles of liquids. It's much more ecological. The bathroom did, however, have a lingering mildew smell. We couldn't find any mildew, but it was definitely on the nose. In actuality, the bathroom decor is gorgeous, but not all that functional. The sink, for example, is quite modern but does not drain well (due to design, not a plumbing issue) and splashes water all over the place. The toilet paper, as another reviewer mentioned, is scratchy, but we accepted this as the hotel uses an ecological toilet paper product. As another reviewer mentioned, too, we were baffled by the lack of a hotel guide in the guest room, a TV channel guide, or even a pad of paper and a pen. Checkout was painfully slow and inefficient. I waited and waited for a charge from the hotel's restaurant (JSix) to show up on our folio, even though it had been a hour since we left the restaurant. The hotel staffer just kept asking me to wait and she would check the folio in between helping other guests. There had to be a better way to handle this.

I've also stayed in their DC property, and enjoy the young vibe, funky style, and elegant modernism of the hotels. Solamar did not disappoint. We stayed on the top floor in a corner room and it was perfect. Everything was cozy, clean and comfortable. The bed was a little too lumpy and soft for both mine and my wife's tastes, so our sleep wasn't as comfortable as we would've liked. The pool area on the 4th floor was wonderful to enjoy. We had lunch there and a few frozen cocktails. Were a bit astounded at the price of the cocktails when we got the bill though -- you do pay for all of that style. So maybe forgo the alcoholic drinks here and enjoy them in one of the many fine, local restaurants. A nice touch is they'll print out and display a photo you send them ahead of time to make you feel more at home. One of those personal touches that anyone could do on their own, but since they thought of it, it made it seem even more special. The Internet was fine. The only tiny thing was the designers who insist on using sliding doors in bathrooms (when there was plenty of room in this room for a regular door). Sliding doors are great for doors you don't open or close very often, because they tend to be harder to open and close, and if not perfectly aligned, they don't always close tight. Case in point was in our room, where there was a very noticeable crack when the bathroom door was closed because the door was no longer level.

The gentleman at the front desk was very professional calm and apologetic. He let me know that someone would be up as soon as possible. I was waiting outside to point security to the right room and 2 gentleman, a stockier guy and a blonde guy who appeared to be security.

Couldn't even watch the Padres' games on TV at night. 5. A/C was either too hot or too cold. 6. Street noise was incredibly loud, even on the 9th floor. 7. Safe didn't work but was corrected. 8. Missing a lot of basic communications -- a guest handbook, a TV channel listings, etc. 9. Bed was quite hard and difficult to sleep in ... 10. Printers in business center didn't work. I wouldn't pay full price. It is an okay hotel, but nothing to write home about and if you can get it at a good price, that's fine. 7.", "Date": "July 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Darlington, England", "Title": "\u201cContemporary Heaven!\u201d", "Author": "stripey2000", "ReviewID": "UR72569536", "Content": "My wife and i spent 4 nights at this hotel over a weekend recently. We both absolutely loved this place, Kimpton have really hit the nail on the head here and created my perfect hotel. All of the public areas were as gorgeous as the room itself. The whole place was bang up to date, modern and contemporary with fantastic sexy, moody decor throughout. The rooftop poolside was just fabulous. I love the review posted by the guy below, regarding the poolside being like the set of a beer commercial, he\u2019s not wrong! I think that was a very creative way to describe it and so correct too! A small heated pool, surrounded by contemporary loungers with gaudy towels, palm trees and seating areas dotted all over, and a great looking bar with lots of people enjoying a beer in the sunshine with a few tunes. Saturday night was our favourite night, the pool bar and terrace (Lounge-six) gets packed with partygoers and was one of our best nights partying. Only one thing spoilt it and that\u2019s drinks being served in plastic glasses, yack. Our room overlooked the poolside terrace but with the window closed you could not hear any noise at all. To the right of the ample worktop/dresser, i found the minibar to be probably the best stocked minibar i\u2019ve ever seen. It had everything, a massive selection of different drinks and loads of snacks too. I was very happy to see that it was actually quite well priced and not a rip off like some hotels. The beds were really comfy with quality linen and the bathrooms were superb with a super powerful shower. We stayed on a bed and breakfast board basis and the breakfast was served downstairs in the hotel restaurant called J-six. Each morning a continental breakfast was served which my wife thoroughly enjoyed, but i wanted something a little more substantial. There was an option to upgrade (for a small fee) to the All American Breakfast, and i can honestly say that it was the very best breakfast i have ever experienced in any hotel i have ever visited (and that\u2019s a lot!). So be sure to go get one! The location of the hotel was probably the icing on the cake, located just one small block over from the main street of the historic Gaslamp district where all the nightlife is situated. If you stay in San Diego then you absolutely cannot miss the experience of a Saturday night on the main street in the Gaslamp. The electric atmosphere is absolutely buzzing, almost magical, and there is a dizzying array of bars and restaurants to choose from.

I was shocked to find there was a $35 charge for \"valet parking\" for each day of the conference, a fee not stated in the terms of agreement. This increased the price of our stay to over $200 per day. This cost was not what our budget was planned for, since we had to stay the whole week for our class. Their statement that parking fees at $35/day are in line with fees throughout San Diego is not true; this hotel is not in New York city. The hotel itinerary mentioned a complimentary expanded continental breakfast to our hosts conducting our class, but I never did see it. The hotel attendants did not mention this to me when I checked in. I assumed that the hotel, particularly with its robust guest charges, had a continental breakfast, but during my first morning I had to order a breakfast at the hotel restaurant for an additional charge, and the time of waited service made me late for the class, so I forwent additional breakfasts for the remaining time I was at the hotel. Also, the wireless network was difficult to implement, both in the rooms and in the conference rooms.

While I was eventually given an e-mail password to logon to the free wireless network, my laptop would frequently try to lock on the wireless service requiring a fee, since the free wireless was set to a weaker signal. I found the hotel requiring any wireless charges onerous, considering that most other hotels provide free service, and hotel charges at this place were at a premium. Finally, I found the hotel rooms lacking amenities, such as a simple coffee maker, and an empty refrigerator. The refrigerator and shelves were all stuffed with expensive drinks the guest was supposed to buy. Since there was no room to put my books up, I had to push all the drinks aside. I felt the hotel was more interested in alcohol sales than providing a functioning room for the guest.

As I was traveling on business having fast internet is very useful and the service here was excellent, it was available in my room as wired or WiFi and it never bogged down like happens in many lower tier hotels. The desk set-up was also good with enough room and comfort to spread out and get my work done quickly. They have a free happy hour in the lounge from 5-7 and offered wine, sparkling wine, and spiced hot cider each night. A nice little bonus. Also available in the mornings in the lobby was above average coffee. Excellent location, easy walk to many many restaurants and retail shops. Lots of the local restaurants have live music to enjoy during or after dinner. Although the hotel does allow dogs if you desire to have them with you, I saw no evidence of it during my stay. Someone complained in another review that the place was filled with people with their dogs but I think they must have visited during a special dog event or something because there were none around this week. In fact I've stayed an several pet friendly Kimpton hotels and have only rarely seen a guest with their pet. The rooms are super clean and I have pet allergies but don't have any troubles staying at these hotels.", "Date": "December 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cOh ,what a night!!!\u201d", "Author": "Riff M", "ReviewID": "UR50680603", "Content": "Just had a most EXCELLENT stay at the Solamar!!!

I knew that the pool bar can get noisy but since it was a weekday I accepted the new room and BOY was I happy!! It was just gorgeous! Living room with flat screen, comfy chaise lounge+couch etc and a giant outdoor terrace. I am sure all the rooms have the wonderful bed with its very high thread count sheets and comforter. Even my husband noticed how soft and comfy everything felt. We also enjoyed the giant whirlpool tub in the bathroom. We called down for some bath salts and they were sent right up. It makes your skin feel extra soft after the bath. I think it is definitely worth it to book a room with that kind of tub. The hotel provided nice bathrobes too. We used the pool for some relaxing laps and found the water to be sooo warm. It was almost like another bath. The pool is surrounded by couches and lounges arranged in cozy nooks/cabanas with a bar and fireplace. In the evening at 5PM the hotel hosts a wine hour in the \"living room\" just off the lobby. They have a different wine theme each week and this one was Spain. So we tasted some bubbly cava and a nice red Tempranillo which I had never had before . Yum! They also had hot apple cider and cold non alcoholic juice.

Maybe this is due to a pet friendly policy, but it smelled more like must/mold than pet chemicals. I will say that one housekeeping staff was very good, and one of the girls at the front desk was very friendly and nice with directions, however another acted as if the last place she wanted to be was working at the front desk of a hotel. We also had a door key issue when we checked in late one night that ended up with maintenance working on our door at 11pm at night. Sorry neighbors! This was after 2 keys would not work upon check-in. We asked for another (equal) room instead the might be quieter anyway, since we had prerequested a quiet room and ours was right outside the pool area where the action can get loud at night, but they were bound and determined to fix the door and wanted to move us the next day instead.

Here\u2019s some wrinkles during a two-night stay in mid-August: .The so-called free internet service available to Kimpton In Touch guests never worked for us but we didn't pursue it after two inquiries with the front desk. .We stayed only two nights and on the second day, our room was still not \"made up\" at 2 pm which I thought was rather late so I had to call the front desk. In the hallway, housekeeping staff seemed to imply to me that their workload had recently increased. (Sounds like a cost-cutting move on the part of management.) Guests shouldn\u2019t have to wait until mid-afternoon when they return to the room to work or relax/nap to have housekeeping come in while using the room. .Parking is advertised on the website as $32 but is posted at the hotel entry as $35. (Either way, it\u2019s ridiculously overpriced!) The front desk claimed the rate changed either 2 or 3 months ago and that it has been updated on the website but remembering that I read it there only a month ago or less, I asked them to honor the prior advertised price. (Because the internet service didn\u2019t work for us, I couldn\u2019t check it during our trip). I had no less than four conversations with different front desk staff the first night and next morning before ascertaining that the parking staff (apparently, a separately-run business) approved the discount. Talking to so many different people was a major irritant -- couldn't the first person get the answer immediately? Now that we\u2019re home, I see that the website price is still $32 (on 8/20) \u2013 despite their claims that the increased price had been posted \u2013 but if Kimpton reads these reviews, it will get changed soon! .The bathroom is wonderful except the sink \u2013 a trendy design that causes water to splash everywhere because it\u2019s set so high. .The rooftop pool is small (and pretty chilly) with limited seating but we got lucky on a weekday and had a cabana to ourselves. In three hours time, staff never once walked around to pick up towels left behind on chaises that guests had left unoccupied for hours, which means late-comers think all lounges are taken. Staff should make sure guests aren't reserving chairs for long blocks of time. .When we checked out and were asked about our stay, I said \u201cthere were a few wrinkles\u201d but she never asked what they were or if I was ultimately satisfied with my stay.

The price for the central gaslamp district location looked too good to be true. I was expecting to be disappointed and for this to be one of those times when the photos looked better than the reality. I had looked at other quality hotels in the area and they were much more expensive, so wasnt expecting much. However, on arrival we checked in to a very classy and upmarket reception area and was greeted with complimentary wines and nibbles (offered to guests daily in the afternoons) and then we were delighted with the appointment of our room. Large king size bed and roomy room with a fridge. Very modern fittings and decor. We got a rollaway bed for our son and there was plenty of room for it. They didnt charge extra for it (most other hotels seem to charge a nightly fee for these). The bathroom was luxourious but did not have a full bath (it was 3/4 size). The air conditioning was very good and quiet. Large flat screen TV and good selection of channels. We were on the top floor and overlooked Pitco Park. There were baseball games and fireworks most night (very cool!)... but dispite this the room was very quiet (double glazing) and it didnt impact our stay in a negative way. In fact it was fun to watch. Great black out curtains helped get our son to sleep and sleep in in the mornings. The hotel offered a complimentary continential breakfast and although it wasnt quite what we were expecting it was a lovely start to the day. It comprised of a pastry, and lovely bowl of fresh fruit and coffee/tea. You could add other items from the menu for a cost. We enjoyed the rooftop pool although it is quite small and very popular in the afternoons. The staff were very helpful and freindly. The only real negative for me was that there were no guest laundry services (other than drycleaning for individual items). There were also no coin laundries nearby. The staff did not have a solution/suggestion when I enquired and I would have thought they would have been asked for directions etc before but I definatley felt like I was the first ever person to ask this question. I had to travel a long way by public transport to a pretty scarey district out of town to do this. The outside is an old brick building that looks like it could have been a firestation or something like that....it is extremely understated. Once you go inside you will be pleasantly surprised. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who needs a good location near to public transport, shops, many many great resturants, the waterfront etc - but that is also on a budget.", "Date": "July 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, AZ", "Title": "\u201cVery pleased\u201d", "Author": "Jodie085", "ReviewID": "UR34833555", "Content": "I was very pleased with this hotel (especially considering the great deal I found).

Within a short walking distance to the baseball park, convention center and numerous restaurants and shopping areas. This made staying here extremely convenient and easy. I can't say I have many gripes about the hotel. The elevators were sometimes slow and the hot water in my shower could have been a bit hotter, but it was not uncomfortable. As I said, the pool stayed pretty busy and I found it difficult to find an empty lounge chair on the weekends, so if you are looking to get a tan at your hotel pool, get there early to claim your spot.

The wine and cheese tasting in the evening and free tea and coffee in the lobby each morning is a nice touch - even if you don't use it, still makes you feel as if the hotel is really trying to make a good impression. Free newspapers each morning. There is free wifi - though a somewhat ridiculous setup process involving joining the Kimpton Club, which is free. On the up side my iphone automatically logged itself into another Kimpton hotels wifi when we were in San Francisco. Our room had two separate areas with a living room / bedroom set up. Neither room was huge but both had enormous televisions. The two areas had a sliding door so you could lock yourself off if you really wanted to. All the photos on Trip Advisor show a walk in shower in the rooms. Our room didn't have one. So if this is important to you I would make sure you request one when you book. There are nice touches in the room that make it seem like a more personal hotel rather than another big chain. From the distinctive bathrobes, to the pinboard where they place notes about what's going on in the hotel and around town. The pool and bar area on the rooftop is lovely during the evening sun. Though one night they closed half of it off for a private function. The only thing I'd really complain about is the valet parking. The hotel seems to have the most expensive parking in the city.

Received a complimetnary welcome gift in the afternoon, which is always appreciated. Attended the wine hour friday before heading off to Joltn Joes nearby for dinner, drinks and sporting events. Went out to a nightclub literally across the street so this place is convenient for those attending a night out at Stingaree. 2nd day spent time at the pool, checked out the jazz festival going on nearby and walked over to meet friends up at Hooters for dinner and the UFC fight. Of course I put the tub to use and relaxedin the jacuzzi. Sunday morning prior to leaving had another pleasant surprise, and if I could give this stay 6 stars, I would! I am a frequent visitor to san diego and will keep an eye out on special offers for the solamar since its is perfectly located to to an abundance of things in san diego.

On my way out the housekeeper on the floor(Very friendly btw) was cleaning the room next to mine so I asked if she could clean mine next since I was going to be going out to grab a bite. I wanted to allow her time to finish what she was doing, so I figured I could hang out at the pool area, watch the yankees game and have my sandwich while the room was getting cleaned. Unfortunately it turns out the pool also has a restaurant(all i had seen was a bar) and so she told me I could NOT bring outside food. Thats fine, BUT then on my walk out, i noticed A LOT of people with outside food. My room wasnt ready, so i ate in the living room area, headed back to the pool area to sit and watch the game and as i walked around most people lounging in the pool area had outside food.

I was on a mom/daughter mini vacation with my 28 year old daughter. I originally chose the Solamar for the great promo rate I heard about on the weekend edition of the Today Show. They showcased the hotel as a hip hotel and I thought it would appeal to my daughter. However, I was very skeptical after I booked it because of all the negative reviews I had read here at tripadvisor. I must say that our experience/stay was wonderful. Both of us were a little leary about staying in a hotel that allows pets because we both have allergies. I called the hotel and the front desk assured me they had a whole floor devoted to pet free rooms. (However, I could not find a place to indicate that I wanted a pet-free room when I reserved on-line. So if it is an issue for you, call them directly and request it. ) I had read many complaints about noise from the pool/bar area so upon check-in I asked for a room on the \"quiet side.\" They did not have any rooms left on the quiet side of the pet-free floor, but would gladly move us to another floor that did have quiet side rooms available. The receptionist told us that the pet-free floor was the top floor of the hotel and that we would be far enough up from the pool/bar that noise should not be a problem. Obviously we could not stay in a pet friendly room and chose to stay with our original room, #1027, We could not have been happier. Our hotel room looked directly down on the pool/bar. We were able to watch the action without hearing any of the noise. For us, noise was not an issue at all. Previous reviews mentioned an unfriendly attitude among the staff. We did not find this to be the case. Everyone we encountered was helpful and friendly. Our room was very clean and up to date. Our housekeeper Maria was excellent. (We could tell she had the day off on Saturday. The room was clean, but not quite as well as when Maria made it up.) The front desk was very friendly and helpful at check-in. At night there is an evening wine reception in the \"Living Room\". They offered a white and a red Pinot on all four nights. It was not top drawer wine. But,judging by the crowd people did not seem to mind the quality of the free wine one bit. I thought the wine reception was a nice touch. I would like to suggest that they do not always serve the same exact wine every night. Maybe they could mix it up with a different red such as a Cab , Malbec, or possibly a Merlot and then a Charddonay for a white option. Something different for those of us who are staying more than one night. Still that is a minor complaint and free wine is better than no wine at all. We also received a bottle of wine at check-in that was part of our promo rate. Again, a nice touch. And we received coupons for free continental breakfast in the hotel restaurant. Someone mentioned in a review that they did not like that wait staff served you your continental breakfast because they felt obligated to leave a tip. We did not mind being served and leaving a tip. Juice or coffee, several choices of a pastry, and a beautiful fresh fruit bowl was the complimentary continental breakfast. I do not know if every guest automatically gets continental breakfast. But even with a tip, it was an inexpensive way to jumpstart the day. And if you are a big breakfast eater, you could always order something in addition to your fruit and pastry off their breakfast menu which we did one day. Of course, you have to pay for anything extra beyond the continental breakfast. I should mention that they also have free coffee and tea in the morning in the \"Living Room\". I am not a coffee drinker, but my daughter took advantage of this nice amenity. Some reviews mentioned that the pool was not clean. The weather was chilly when we were there, but people were using the pool. It looked very clean and we overheard a guest saying the water temperature was warm. We did not use the pool, but did enjoy relaxing by it one afternoon after a day of sightseeing. I am guessing the pool gets more use in the summer and more sunscreen residue probably builds up on the sides of the pool. If that were to happen, that would be a turn off for me as well. I loved the location of this hotel. It is close to public transportation and the PETCO stadium. We were able to walk from here to Little Italy with no problem. (On a hot day you would probably want to take the light rail public transportation known as the Trolley to Little Italy.) We also attended a baseball game at PETCO during our stay. It was nice not to have to hassle with finding a parking space near the stadium. Other reviews mentioned the cost of valet parking. We did not have a rental car so I cannot comment on this. A previous review said the fitness room was small. It is small, but I never had to wait for a treadmill. There are 2 treadmills, 1 eliptical, weights, and then a bike is actually outside adjacent to the fitness room. One morning one of the treadmills did not have any power, but a hotel employee promptly came in and fixed it. Finally, there are many restaurants and night clubs in the area. We ate at a couple of them. But our best meals were brunch at Hash House A Go Go in Hillcrest and dinner at the Top of the Fish Market. We took a taxi to Hash House A Go Go. It cost us $10.90 and I gave the driver $15. We took the Trolley to the Seaport Village stop and walked the rest of the way to the Fish Market on Saturday night. It was a lovely night and we ended up walking all the way back to the hotel after our dinner. I should mention that we did have a king room. I was prepared for a tiny room because of some of the other reviews. Maybe because I was on a cruise about four weeks ago, but I thought the room size was very adequate. The bathroom sink is annoying-very contemporary and shallow. I think you can see it on the hotel's website. Someone said it is too high. I would disagree with that. I am short and height isn't the issue. One, it is set too far back, but the real issue is that it is too shallow and water splashes every where. It does however look cool. For the promo rate and all the other pluses this hotel had to offer, the sink was tolerable for days. I know this review is long, but I hope it will help somebody who was on the fence about lodging. I am a very picky traveler who prefers 4 and 5 star hotels and who is obsessed with cleanliness. (The carpets in the hallways did look worn, but our carpet in the room was new.)

But I suspect that this was how it is at all the hotels in San Diego so I couldn't be that disappointed in the parking situation. The beds were comfortable and they had nice flat screen TVs. The rooms were very nicely decorated and I was impressed. The only odd thing was that there weren't any drawers. The bathrooms were also nice. I just love the Aveda toiletries that they provide. One complaint that I do have is that there is a nightclub in the building and around 11pm the music can be heard in the room for a few hours.

The staff was so friendly that it was almost annoying, especially since we had been up since 4 am getting to the airport and flying to San Diego.

After completing our stay I realized that the hotel was very empty for our entire stay. I also requested extra keys as we had a larger party. I was told that they were out of keys and could only provide one per room! The next night, we came back a little late and we needed our room key to get into the front door. Because we were only given one key, we didn't have a key with us and the same lady that checked us in quickly offered us TWO extra keys (one for each of our rooms). After pulling up our room in the computer, she handed me ONE key and said goodnight. The next day, I found out that the new key worked just fine, but the original key had been deactivated!! After asking I was quickly given extra keys for both rooms by a much nicer girl at the front desk (during the day). I hope it was just a coincidence or computer error but if she pulled this because we got a good deal on the rooms she should be fired or Solamar should not sell rooms through Priceline. My other big complaint was with the stench in the hallway. Many times when we returned to our rooms we could immediately smell the stench of bathroom (#2) as soon as we entered the hallway. The vent that is near the elevator must be for the bathrooms as you can see it as soon as you get off of the elevator. Even our guests immediately noticed this. Also, the $32 valet service was not what I expected for that price. The valets were friendly, but we waited way too long for our cars to be retrieved (up to 10 minutes).

The best part of hotel is staff. The front desk staff were amazing.

We did move once because we stayed during Halloween and a loud street concert was going on right out our window. They moved us to 10th floor which they didn't have to do. The view was amazing. City, litte of the ocean. Right now there is some construction going on at properties near the hotel. The only time it even bothered me was during the weekday by the pool. Hard to relax with the construction noise. Valet parking is pricey ($32) but if you go in and out a lot, its probably worth it than trying to find public parking. So much is within walking distance. Restaurants, Petco Park (for summer events especially), nice mall. All in all, I would recommend the hotel. I have heard that some rooms experience noise from the pool bar but I would think it would have to be extremely busy for that to happen. And yes, some ocassions they do close the pool to guests to accomodate a private party which does put you off a little. They only did that once during our stay so we didn't mind.

We chose it because so many of the other hotels in the Gaslamp area were extremely overpriced, and we were looking for a hotel with a nice pool. We booked this online through expedia for about 150 per night, and it was certainly worth that amount. The rooms were clean, done in a pretty beachy decor, and were comfortable. The maids always did a good job of keeping the room in order, although they never seemed to leave us enough towels (2 towels for 2 ppl isn't enough in my opinion)...so we just requested more, which was no problem. The hotel is busy. There are lots of people there at night, especially in the pool area. Our friends had a room over the pool and they said that the noise at night wasn't an issue. The pool is beautiful and gets great sun. However, there isn't much space for lounging. They have about 6 lounge chairs out, and 3 cabanas. One day we arrived in the afternoon and there was no place to lie out. When I asked the bartender where we were supposed to sit, he kindly offered up the cabana for free (for which they normally charge $250 per day). On our last day we also noticed that they had a stack of lounge chairs behind the bar, which you can take and set up if you want to. The pool was pretty and a lot of fun! The hotel is within walking distance to some clubs, restaurants and bars, and they offer you free coffee and tea in the morning, which is a nice touch. Now for my gripes. I didn't find the hotel to be overly functional. I compare it to a really hot girl without a brain. The rooms looked nice but there was no good area for putting on makeup, and there was a lack of counter space and shelving. The pool looked beautiful, but the lack of sitting space was a bit annoying and somewhat stressful. They have sex kits for purchase in the room - lubricant, condoms, etc. I guess paying $7 for a sex kit when in dire need is worth it, but I don't need to be reminded of the thousands of people who have had sex in the bed that I'm paying $150 per night for! Yuck! They also have these strange leopard housecoats for purchase. These two things made me think that the hotel might secretly be frequented by pimps and people with weird sexual fetishes. Finally, parking was $30 per day - insane! We had no real problems with this hotel, but I just didn't find it functional enough overall.

I left my bags at the Solamar and picked them up the next afternoon before going to the airport. I requested a room away from the pool and found that this was already the case. My room preference of two double beds was accommodated also. My only criticism of the 10th floor room was that it was quite noisy due to the hotel's ventilation fan.

Unfortunately there are so many problems with the property that I cannot imagine staying here again. We arrived on a very early flight and had asked for an early check in which ended up being no problem. We were in town for a wedding and told by the groom that a gift bag had been delivered to our room but to our dismay there was no gift bag in our room or at the front desk. The Concierge said they couldn't find it and suggested that it was accidentally given to someone else in another wedding party. Then he offered their gift bag to us! Obviously we declined as that is not exactly the appropriate resolution to the problem. Valet and Concierge services very slow and rather detached. If you enjoy good service with a finer touch you will not find it here. I found the previous reviews describing the service as catering to the 20 - something crowd (meaning they cater to the party/drunk crowds) to be very accurate. Lines were very long at the front desk for people either checking in or asking questions. Lines to get your car were even worse. Attempts to call down to the valet to have the car ready went unanswered several times. Room service was disappointing at best. We called most nights for a late snack and they either never answered the phone or said they would call back and never did. The front desk also called our room several times by mistake sometimes in the early morning or very late at night. The biggest problem at this hotel is the constant pool party. I cannot stress enough to people booking this hotel to book a room that doesn't overlook the pool and bar on the 4th floor. If you want a hotel to relax by the pool then this is not the hotel for you. The few chairs they have are taken first thing in the morning and the place is crawling with people in their 20s and 30s and DRUNK. By the end of the afternoon the pool area was littered with plates of half eaten food, beer bottles, dirty towels and other garbage these people left. The DJ started at noon and went until 11:30 or 12 at night. The music was a constant \"thump thump thump\" of house/techno mixed in with the noise of bar and pool patrons singing at the top of their lungs. Think of it as a nightclub right in the middle of the property. The drunk partygoers would then spill into the lobby every now and then and harass hotel guests. For a hotel that charges almost $250 per night (and $32 for parking per night) I was appalled that they were ok with all this. Several other guests we spoke to in the lobby were also very disappointed and angry. We demanded a room on the other side of the building to get away from the pool. Our new room was a little quieter but I began to realize that we were smack dab in the midst of more partygoers later that night who had rooms near ours. The noise from their rooms drifted down that halls and into our room. We called security about 4 times to complain about the yelling and screaming which finally ceased around 1am. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone who doesn't sit well with the younger crowd, partygoers and noise because that is what this hotel is all about.

We had asked the valet to leave our car out of the way while we checked to see if we could check-in. When we went to get our car, it was gone (put in the garage), and we had no claim ticket, so we had to wait until the guy that we left the keys with returned. The valet area is small so I understood. We booked through Priceline, so we unsure what kind of room we would receive. We were given a standard room on the 5th floor with a king bed and a standard tub. The room was very similar to the pictures that we saw online, except for the decorative (polka dot) mini-comforter. We called the front desk to ask for the comforter, thinner pillows, a fan, and to fix the TV (awful picture on all channels). Within 2 minutes a technician was there for the TV. We left the room to check out the pool area. When we returned in a few minutes everything we asked for was taken care of. This was the theme throughout our stay. The only speed bump was on one day after a very late night we slept in until 1, and left our room at 2. I saw the maid 2 doors down so I assumed that we would be ok. We got back at 2am to find that our room was not cleaned. I called the front desk and I got the condescending/indifferent person. The maid was at my room in 2 minutes to clean the room, but I just asked for towels, as we were very tired and still needed to shower. The maid was very pleasant and offered to clean the room. I declined as I heard her radio say that she was needed to clean another room. The area around the hotel is an active entertainment area. There is activity everywhere and lots of people. You can park 2 blocks down from the hotel for $16 a day or less (no in and out privileges). During the day parking can be had for $1 hour.

I raced back ready to confront the drunk and was immediately approached by security and asked for my room key. I presented it and explained why I was hyped. He explained that they had dealt with the several disruptive individuals and apologized. He asked if there was anything that they could do to compensate us for our trouble. We declined.

There was no apology, just attitude. 3) NOISE. Oh my goodness. I enjoy a good party, music and a few beers just like everyone else. But I thought I was witnessing a taping of MTV Spring Break. The music started in the early afternoon and continued throughout the night. We left the hotel on purpose and walked around just to avoid the annoying house music. The pool area is full of scenesters and people looking to hook up so you can't relax. We didn't even mind the noise in the hallway because the noise from the pool overpowered it. 4) They brag about free tea and coffee in the morning, but they ran out of lids for coffee cups. When asked if they were going to get more, they stated flatly they ran out. Huh? I would never stay here again.

Soooo glad I placed more faith in Kimpton's outstanding service than in a couple negative reviews. The whole experience was fantastic from the moment I pulled up. Yes, the valet parking is expensive (everything is expensive in SD, and Solamar's rates are consistent with the market). Based on earlier reviews, was very careful to reserve a quiet room and specified away from and above pool level. Front desk offered me exactly what I asked for, but also offered an upgraded room away from the pool, but on the pool floor. Made the right choice by taking the upgraded room. The room was around the corner and as far from the pool as possible (#434). Stayed here a whole week and did not once hear a peep from the pool. Having spent about my share of time at the pool, I can believe that some of the lower pool facing rooms might have a valid complaint about the noise from the pool's bar--especially if they open their windows--so consider requesting a room away from the pool. One of the reviews complained about thin walls. Don't really know what they're talking about--that wasn't my experience. The side walls of the rooms are as quiet as anywhere else. Yes, you can hear your neighbors when they're talking too loudly in the hallway as they walk by. But that's no different that almost any other hotel I've stayed at (and I'm pretty sensitive to extraneous noise). If I have to find faults, they are these: (1) The hotel's exterior windows (at least my room's) are getting a __little__ dirty. They open, but not in any way that the hotel could wash them without hiring a professional window washer. This is probably not the sort of thing that would bother most guests, if they noticed it at all (the hotel, firmly in Downtown's center, doesn't enjoy views of the Bay); (2) Got some bad advice from staff member trying to be helpful responding to my subjective questions: was told \"nothing to do at the Embarcadero\" (it's a nearby park that might be useful for walking your dog at this pet-friendly hotel) and \"free parking is tough up by Balboa Park\" (that just totally wasn't my experience--maybe I was there on an off day?); (3) Not too thrilled with the light filtering curtain set up--they open & close with rods that are attached to the sheer fabric by a nut & bolt--a pretty flimsy setup that was wearing out in my room. Gee, that's my biggest complaint--closing the curtains. Life must be tough. Someone mentioned the guests are pretty young here, and that's right. All ages are represented, but the bell curve skews toward the late 20s/30s. During the Saturday night of my stay, Pepperdine U. had a formal event for some of their students, who were staying at the hotel--so my experience may not have been the norm. Surprisingly, heard no ruckus from these kids! Hotel has a great location in SD's Gas Light District. No shortage of things to do/places to eat. A 5 minute walk from the Convention Center. Oh, the 5-6PM wine hour is a great way to start off a crawl to the nearby restaurants. Hotel's restaurant (J Six) and poolside bar are very good. Both a little expensive (but still within market prices). Food was at least as good (had both dinner and breakfast here) as 75% of the nearby restaurants, but maybe a notch shy of excellent. Staff is __extremely__ helpful; if you've never stayed at a Kimpton, you'll just have to understand that this chain sets the standard for service quality. Everyone....front desk, restaurant/bar, valet, housekeeping, and maintenance goes out of their way to acknowledge you and make your stay as comfortable as possible. I'd unhesitatingly recommend this hotel to anyone going to stay in Downtown SD. It's not the cheapest hotel around, but it's worth it. There are also other choices nearby if you want to get lost in a megalithic hotel (e.g., Omni; Marriott; Grand Hyatt, all nearby).

I did complain to the manager about this but regretably she was not very helpful saying that there was nothing they could do.

The rate was $139/night...and I was initially a bit apprehensive about this being the hotel revealed.

There wasn't even a mention of cribs being available on the website---although a lot of cool services available for dogs were highlighted. I wrote the property via their website to inquire about the cribs. I quickly received a voice mail message from a very nice man who assured me that they had cribs and to call if I had any questions or further requests. And thus began an amazing experience with the Hotel Solamar's customer service from every single employee we dealt with---from the front desk check-in to the cleaning people we saw in the hall. Everyone seems genuinely delighted to see you and eager to offer recommendations on how to make your stay in the hotel and the area more enjoyable. And bear in mind our party had two almost 3-year old boys in tow (enough to make most people head for the hills). Parents will appreciate how one host named Gordie got down to my son's level, really listened and had a nice conversation with him, and then greeted him by name whenever he saw him. Each child was also presented with a little goody bag of toys, including a thoughtful pre-soaped, duck-shaped sponge that made bathtime a real treat. When the crib was delivered, it was already assembled and was made up with sheets---this in itself is rather unusual! The rooms are a little small, but very well decorated in a hip, modern style. Even the bathrobes are funky----zebra and leopard skin patterned terry cloth! Hilarious! Our bellman who delivered our luggage also kindly pointed out that the honor bar doesn't have those annoying sensors that charge your room if any of the fridge contents get moved---so if you can refrigerate a few small items of your own. The one slight service gaffe was that there was no honor bar key in our room, and it took about half an hour for them to locate an extra one. It seems that most people who get rooms via a discount website get placed on the 4th floor which is the same floor as their pool and poolside bar. The front desk lady was proactive in giving us our rooms facing away from the pool to limit our exposure to DJ noise (seeing as we had young kids), but there was some hallway rowdiness from partygoers entering/leaving the pool area. Nothing terrible though, and the pool closes at 9. The hotel's restaurant JSix is gorgeously appointed, and serves delicious breakfast for a surprisingly reasonable price! Try the Chilaquiles which are amazing! Again, the wait staff were extremely gracious and accommodating to young children. A couple blocks away, the excellent restaurant Basics serves just pizza and salad---but oh, what pizza and salad! The other family vacationing with us originally hail from New York, and they proclaimed it the best pizza they've had on the West Coast. Another great recommendation from the front desk! The location is excellent, only a a few miles away from the San Diego zoo---and a far, far better choice than staying at one of the places on Hotel Circle (especially if you can get a Priceline or Hotwire deal).

Friendly, helpful people working at the Hotel-- From the men at Valet (and yes $30 per night is expensive, but that's the going rate), to the Bellman who gave us recommendations to restaurants and clubs, the Concierge who made reservations for us, to the Front Desk - who upon hearing this was a special trip for us-- possibly up-graded us to a corner room King w/spa tub. Everyone working at the Hotel Solamar was fantastic. The Amenities-- modern, well-appointed rooms, very comfortable bed. Clean. No issue with noise or house-keeping. And the crazy Zebra and Tiger bathrobes, we loved it. Nightly Happy Hour from 5-6pm, red wine and/or champagne. Tough decisions to make!! Checked out the J-Bar on the fourth floor only briefly (too cold/rain), but it seemed like a happening place (I can only imagine the summer-time).

We were in need of a nice getaway following Thanksgiving. When finding the Hotel Solomar and checking out the website it seemed cool enough with this kind of peaceful, serenity vibe. Even had yoga chick looking ultra relaxed. The picture showed a nice d\u00e9cor, a bit trendy and then I saw a special for \u201cRomantic Rendezvous\u201d. Perfect! The special was to include cold champagne waiting our arrival, chocolate truffles on our bed, and bed and breakfast.yummy! Sounds pretty romantic eh? Oh but NO. Once we got there, the bubbly but unhelpful reservation woman informed us that we did not have the \u201cRomantic Rendezvous\u201d special and instead had some other promotion. Huh? We don\u2019t want another special. I paid for romance so I expect romance dammit! Soon the manager (I guess) sensing a little trouble tried to help saying he would \u201clook into it and let us know if the morning\u201d. Let us know in the morning? That too late! We want our breakfast in bed so this needed to be taken care of right now. Later we got a call that because of the confusion (in which there was no \u201cconfusion\u201d), they would credit us $50 for room service (More on this in a second). But what about our champagne? What about our truffles? At least a Snickers bar or something! A bit about the hotel: Actually, in all fairness, it\u2019s not that bad. The location is nice in that it is walking distance to the popular Gas lamp district with lots of shopping and restaurants. The d\u00e9cor was pretty funky, no complaints. The room was nice although small. We were warned about all the noise we would receive since the bar and pool is in the center of the hotel. Hopefully, it was just a bad week for them on this Friday and Saturday night, because there may have been seven people max (2 were bartenders\u2026and 1 bar back). So, huh, noise was not an issue. Probably our favorite part was their complimentary wine hour where the guests can mingle in a pretty cool lounge/sitting area and if nothing else, look cool. More importantly, we found this a time to cash in on our missing romantic package, so we helped ourselves to refills oh about every 10 minutes, \u201cborrowed\u201d the wine glasses (they\u2019re in our cupboard right now) and proceeded to purposely get very buzzed and well, romantic! In passing the front desk, another cheery unhelpful reservation girl asked if there was anything she could do for me. Well yes\u2026give us some champagne! I explained once again how they screwed us out of our romantic package and quite possibly jeopardized our chances of an everlasting marriage. I should sue! She said she would send up a bottle of Champagne. Ok, now we\u2019re getting somewhere. Not even 5 minutes later, they call the room saying they out of champagne. $&*&^! \u2013 WTF, how can a hotel be fresh out of champagne. Especially an EMPTY hotel?? Instead we got another bottle of the wine we had already abused earlier. Great. So that evening get ready for our ghetto breakfast in bed with our $50 credit for room service breakfast due to \u201cconfusion\u201d. So we decide on eggs some bacon, toast, a bagel, lox and cheese. With delivery charge, tax, and gratuity\u2026.$47!!! Double WTF? Another nice thing was that the Hotel Solomar was pet friendly, so we brought our cute little dog, Pepper along. Even he was unhappy as he got attacked by two stray pit bulls in the Gas lamp District. So, considering everything, upon checking out we let him poop on the front lawn (and didn\u2019t pick it up\u2026J/K wink) \u2013 Still, this is about how we felt about their \u201cRomantic Rendezvous\u201d\u2026it was crap. The Hotel Solomar is actually a decent place to stay. I think the main problem is marketing it as something it is not. No, you will not have romance there (although the free wine hour helps). You will not find a happening bar filled with drunken chicks. You will not find a real yoga retreat. You will not find a spacious room. You will get an average to slightly above average place to rest your head with a touch of style.

The good news first....If you like modern boutique hotels, you will be impressed by the decor in both the lobby and the hotel room. Also, if you want to stay in the downtown San Diego area and are debating between hotels like the W and the Sofia, this is definitely the one for you because the Solamar is central to Gaslamp - near the trolleys, restaurants, and shops, while the W and the Sofia are in neighborhoods that are the equivalent of Port Authority in NYC (grungy and technically downtown, but further away from the mainstream and undesirable - I walked by and into both hotels during my stay just out of curiosity). I had requested a room on a high floor facing away from the pool as I had read on here that facing the pool basically means you will get no sleep at any hour of the day. I had called to confirm again the day before that I could get a room facing away on the top floor, but wound up with a room on the top floor facing the pool.

Also, the reviews on here that say that the walls are incredibly thin in this hotel are correct. You can hear basically every slamming door and chat in the hallway. That basically negated the whole \"chic\" experience for me and turned it into a lower end hotel - and this hotel is by no means inexpensive. Missing from this hotel are some of the higher end amenities like a state of the art gym and a bellboy (you drag your own luggage to your room and out of the hotel when you leave). Also there was a general aloofness to the staff. I nearly missed my early flight home because the front desk \"forgot\" my wake up call which I had requested the night before, and I got better tips on the area and touring advice from a nearby hotel than this one.

There were also problems with the shower and we had cracks and holes in the ceiling. (Not something you would expect from a \"4\" star hotel. There was also some kind of \"Chic\" rust all over the bathroom walls. (I think they call it dirt back where I live. The sink in the bathroom is very unique. I'm not sure who designed it but you can't shave or do anything without water spilling all over the floor. I guess this is supposed to be \"Chic\" - but isn't a sink supposed to drain the water away? I have stayed at hotels all over the world and I can assure you this is not one of the better ones. The service is terrible and the rooms are noisy. This hotel caters to 20 something Yuppies who want to party all night long. It was noisy in the hallways and if your were unfortunate enough to have a pool side room, I doubt you would get any sleep all night long. I would rate this hotel a few notches below a Marriott courtyard or a Holiday Inn express. I guess this hotel can justify their ridiculous prices due to the location, but I would highly recommend finding some other place for your stay in San Diego.", "Date": "September 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cSkip the pool view room\u201d", "Author": "OutWanderin", "ReviewID": "UR8525604", "Content": "Very chic hotel with lovely, solicitous staff.

(5) Free wireless is always nice. The bad: (1) The hotel rooms are depreciating fast. This was out second visit and within a year the bedroom furniture looks very different. Our white chair was covered in coffee stains and the walls are in need of repair. (2) Avoid the Virtuoso Suites. Our previous standard room was almost as big. The suite we booked this time was dark, the bedroom was tiny and the living room had no natural daylight. The oversized bathtub was nice but other than that nothing very exciting about he room. (3) The pool is a disaster \u2013 seating for around 10 people in a relatively large hotel is crazy. It also seems that the pool users are mostly non-guests at the weekend. Locals come to the bar, change in the toilets and use the pool. The pool has a DJ playing very loud music on the weekends. We are in our late 20\u2019s, so don\u2019t get us wrong. But on a Saturday at 12 noon you don\u2019t want music so loud that you can\u2019t talk to the person next to you as you relax by the pool (if you could get a seat that is). (4) Room service. Room service is provided by the onsite (but we were told separately managed) restaurant. We never got what we ordered and when we complained were told \u2018too bad.\u2019 One morning they did not have orange juice and decided to send apple juice instead. I declined but was charged anyway! This was just one of a few problems with room service so our advise is to go out for food. (5) Bar. I think this hotel was built as an excuse to have a bar. The bar tends to dominate the hotel and tends to focus on non-hotel guests. We asked if it might be possible to get a table and it was, but only for $250. For San Diego this is a little too much even for the public but you would think that a hotel guest could get a seat without this cost. The worst thing about the bar is the attitude of the bouncers who won\u2019t let hotel guests back to their room to use the toilet. The queue at the bar tends to be long and my wife wanted to go to her room but the bouncer on the hotel exit/entrance told her that if she left she would not be readmitted. This despite the fact that the hotel is directly connected to the bar and this door is used only by hotel guests. So overall, we would save money next time and stay in the Omni down the street. From a prior visit we known that the Omni pool is bigger and far superior, the rooms are nicer and the views are better. We returned to the Solamar because it is smaller and more intimate.

And just last month my wife and I picked the Cypress Hotel in Cupertino, California when we went to see our daugher graduate from Santa Clara. I love the unique things Kimpton does with their boutiquey hotels (most have about 200 rooms) and so signed up for their loyalty program in Cupertino. That being said there are some shortcomings at Hotel Solamar as there probably are with all hotel facilities. Yes, the sink was too shallow (but very artsy-fartsy). Yes, the lighting in the bathroom was too \"moody,\" (dark in the shower, hard to shave in the poorly lit mirror, no fan to extract the moisture from a hot shower). And yes, the music out of our tenth floor window looking down on \"the 20-something scene\" below thumped all night. We came prepared, however. We were in San Diego with two other couples to attend the Padres baseball game. The other two couples were staying at the adjacent Marriott and were paying more ($259.00 as versus our $229.00) for less service. We grabbed our moment to have a drink at the Hotel Solamar bar by meeting the other two couples there for pre-game drinks, before the hip crowd arrived. We always travel with ear plugs so the noise wasn't an issue later on. We are accustomed to the expensive parking fees in that area. But we love the high thread count sheets with the exquisite decorating that Kimpton's do. We like the personal attention their staff gives and their promptness in rendering service. When we needed our car to get called up to go golfing, it was there when we got downstairs. When we called our friends to see where they were, they were still waiting for someone to bring their car around. Everyone from the reception folks to the bell men were anxious to please and engaged in dialogue. I did check around before booking my hotel for this baseball game. We wanted to be within walking distance of Petco Park and the Gaslamp district. The Omni (where we have stayed twice) was quoting $299.00 for this weekend unless you had purchased their baseball special (which had no availability when I checked). The Gaslamp Marriott was at $259.00, the Convention Center Marriott was at $289.00 and originally Hotel Solamar was at $319.00. But with Triple A (or AARP) the rate declined to $239.00 and the loyalty program took another $10.00 a night off. Cheaper price for a more hip environment with better service???...no brainer.

Previously while in San Diego, we have stayed at both the Omni and the Marriott downtown. Available downtown hotel rooms were limited on the night we needed, so I booked first and read tripadvisor afterward. That's the reverse of my usual procedure. I was more than concerned by the alleged flea issues, and I suppose arrived expecting some kind of disguised claptrap. Also, because we are middle aged, I thought we might feel out of place in a world of trendy twentysomethings. Was I in for a surprise! Yes, the hotel is pet friendly, as almost ALL European hotels are, even the most fashionable. (Remember, Oprah won't travel without her dogs and if a place is good enough for Oprah, it's good enough for me.) I only saw one pet; a small poodle type, adoringly held by it's owner and swaddled in pink accessories. Hotel Solamar was immaculate.

The staff was friendly, helpful, and professional at all times and went out of the way to make our stay exceptionally enjoyable. The location is perfect: just steps away from the wonderful restaurants in Gaslamp, and a 2 block walk to Petco Park. Since my husband is a huge baseball fan, I planned a surprise B-Day celebration, and therefore had some special needs. Initially, I asked for a room with a view of the baseball park, and even though we made our reservations through Hotwire, Chip went out of his way to accomodate us. I also had to engage the services of the concierge, Christian. The cake ordered from Extraordinary Desserts (beyond belief!) and 2 special-recipe blended drinks we invented in Cayman were waiting for us in our room following the Padres game. I think every single staff member we encountered wished my husband a Happy B-Day and went way beyond expectations to be sure we had a positive experience. I actually had to force a small gratuity into Christian's hand, as nobody wanted to accept a tip for what I thought was amazing service! They all just said the reward for them was the great fun they had participating in such a surprise! There's a nightly free wine tasting---as many glasses as you like.

I don't know how so many positive reviews have been submitted for this place. The front desk was simply rude, they didn't have the room I reserved and put me on the loud stinky fourth floor. Then, they changed the room key code and locked me out the following evening, they explained they had a new room and had locked me out of my existing room so I'd come to the desk. Whatever happened to leaving a message on the phone? I had to go down to the lobby at 11:00 PM to get a new key. Room service was terrible, dry cereal arrived with only a fork, and no milk. Several requests were never followed up on by either the housekeeping staff or front desk. The only positive service at this hotel is provided by the valets. (The parking is 30.00 per day) I paid 535.00 per night for a king room including taxes and parking. The rooms are poorly designed, no dresser and only one tiny night stand drawer so business travelers can plan to leave personal clothing items on the floor. The bathroom design is not functional, the sink is so shallow it splashed back water all over the place. When I turned on the hot water at the sink it sounded like a jack hammer in the wall. Do yourself a favor, don't stay here unless you want to party like a 20 year old your entire stay. The hotel is wide open for non-hotel guests at the outside bar, the noise never ends between 5:00 and midnight, then it travels to the street below the room windows and spills into the hallways.

The bed was very comfortable and they also upgraded us to an \"extended tub\"...it was an extra-long jacuzzi tub. Interesting, I'm not sure what the benefit of extra-long was because it didn't fit 2 any better than a regular bathtub, oh well. :) They do have FUN animal print bathrobes...I so wanted to take one but they were custom for the hotel and I'm sure it would have cost about $200! We went down to the pool bar area and again, very swanky with long couches and big bowl firepits all over. Partial view of the city, very cool. One weird thing was that they wouldn't let us smoke over by the firepits (against the edge of the building) but we could smoke at the bar, where all the other people were sitting.

In the cleanliness department the only fault I could find would be the windows (This is nit picking as I have been told it had recently rained), other than that the place was immaculate to the point that there weren't even any watermarks in the tub, sink or on any of the fixtures.

Firstly let me say that I have not got a problem with the twentysomethings around the pool and the fact that it is hectic to say the least - I just wish the Solamar advertised the fact. The good points are very good: 1 Location Fantastic location - an easy stroll to the harbour, near all the restaurants and bars in the Gaslamp area (if you like fish you must try McCormick and Shmidt at the Omni on the same street - wonderful catfish)and if your going to a Padres game, its aroundthe corner. 2. Rooms Our room had a pool view (we will come to that later!!!) and was large, clean and very pleasant. Big bed and a lounger were good. 3. Facilities Gym was small and got crowded very easily. Had breakfast in the restaurant which was very nice. Wine tastin is a must. Early evening for an hour. Worth noting however that if its not busy (as with the Sunday of our stay) they dont hang around. Around ten mins to go and they had took all the wine and no one was around to get anymore. Now the problems. There really is only one problem with the hotel and that is if you go to the hotel at the weekends and you not looking for that type of atmosphere (ie loud music, loud people, no room, bouncers on the door) then forget it.

We stayed over Labor Day Weekend and I have to agree with most of the other recent reviewers. First the good: location, location, location. It's an easy walk to the many restaurants of the Gaslamp District, an easy walk to Petco Park and an easy walk to Seaport Village. Our 9th floor corner room was said to have a 'lot more room than our normal rooms.\" I'd hate to see the normal rooms, then. There was literally no space to put clothes. One small drawer on one side of the bedside, and a mini-drawer under the mini-bar. Even smaller was the bathroom. There was no place to hang a hand-towel. We couldn't find room for our own toilet items. And the sink had good form, but no function. The biggest disappointment was the hotel staff. Pleasant but it felt like they were in WAY over their heads. We asked for directions to two nearby restaurants and they had no clue. There was no concierge to ask, since the hotel doesn't have one. When we asked for information on nearby tourist sites, once again they had none. So, I finally asked the front desk if I could see a phone book to look up a number and was told, \"Sorry, we don't have one.\" There was a Padres game Sunday afternoon, and since it was a holiday weekend, the pool area was packed starting around 3:00 with people who wanted to drink to get drunk. There was no way to use the pool, which shouldn't seem like a lot to ask for rooms going over $350/night. Finally, try to find out how recently a dog stayed in your room. While I was at the desk trying to get a phone book, three different people called, asking for a room change. One was because of the noise from the pool, the other two were because of the animal smells.

I enjoyed the atmosphere at the hotel and the staff was very courteous. Our room was cleaned early in the day and it felt very clean. We had wanted two beds, but only a King was left, but we were upgraded to a corner room which was very large. Our room overlooked the pool/club area. It was a nice view. The bathroom was very nicely appointed with quality features, but the lighting was very soft. It was nice and calm in the morning until time to take a close look in the mirror and apply makeup and the it was just too dark in there. I was surprised there wasn't better lighting or a better fan. The wallpaper was ubsosrbing all the moisture, which might lead to problems later with mold. We were greeted professionally by the desk upon our arrival. We were offered a roll away, but ended up being fine sharing a bed with my daughter. The bed was VERY comfortable. We had no trouble with the parking, (valet only $24 a day) we were always noticed by the tag in our window and given priority parking and service as hotel guests. On the weekend the club seems to be one of the hottests places to be. THe lobby was filled with security people and the elevators. THere were people posing a guests of the hotel trying to get into the club sneaking around the hotel. It was uncomfortable to be a hotel guest with all these other people lurking around. We went to our room and the minibar hadn't been restocked, my daughter wasn't feeling well and wanted a sprite. We went to go find one from a soft drink machine. We couldn't find a machine, so we made our way down stairs. Maybe there was one on the floor of the pool/gym but the area was full of people all dressed up and so we didn't feel comfortable getting off there in our \"loungewear\" to look. We asked a few people where we could get a soft drink, but they told us they were all security. We finally went to the frontdesk and were told they would send us up one in 5 minutes, but it never came up. This hotels seems to be two different places, a nice hotel of qualilty service during the day, but the weekend nights seem to be all about the club, and servicing it. THe hotel guests are not the main focus of service, or at least that was our experience. I had been moving my daughter in all day, and was looking forward to a quite soak and swim, which is a usual relaxing experienceat a hotel, but we came back to 200 people surround the pool, which became part of the decor and atmosphere of the club, not something accessible to hotel guests. It seems to me they need to decide what they want to be or offer another area for hotel guests to enjoy. For the price, for a hotel guest to be made to feel like an outsider and second for service was shocking. It is a nice place, just know what to expect and a quiet weekend of being pampered won't be it. Also, I noticed men taking \"women\" up to their rooms from the club, which seemed a bit awkward and like a skanky Vegas hotel instead of a nice clean upscale hotel. It was a strange mix, but over all during the week I would say it is one of the best hotels in SD.

All of the staff was warm and welcoming, from the moment we checked in to having beers on the pool deck, everyone was incredibly helpful and inviting. I can't wait to go back and I will highly recommend to anyone, regarless of your length of stay!", "Date": "April 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cNot pleased at all.\u201d", "Author": "brig70", "ReviewID": "UR4584851", "Content": "This property is owned by the Kimpton Brand of hotels. Unfortunately, a far cry from the other properties in its chain. The pluses: It's definitely a \"boutique\" hotel that offers decent amenities and has a certain feel that appeals to a younger clientel if that's what you look for in a hotel. Every evening from 5-6pm they have a complementary wine social in the lobby. Pretty nice to unwind and relax after a long day. Also, their upstairs pool bar has a nice vibe and very comforting. I stayed at this hotel in January, and I can only assume during the warmer months, this pool bar is busy and packed with the coolest of San Diegoans. The rooms are clean and very comfortable. The bathrooms are stocked with Aveda products and the complementary morning paper greets you at the door. The hotel does have a workout room that offers a few treadmills with cable tv monitors attached, but it is small. If there is more than five people in the room it's packed. So here's why I wasn't so pleased with this hotel. When I checked in, there was nobody at the front desk. Granted, it was 9pm on a Sunday..But I feel this is the second opportunity for your hotel to make a first impression. (The first opportunity is valet, but when my cab pulled up..The valet attended looked at the cab and casually walked back in the hotel.) At the front desk, I waited about three minutes for someone to show. When they finally did, they didn't apologize for the wait nor welcome me to the hotel. The second day, I was supposed to receive a UPS Package. UPS records showed it was delivered, the hotel showed they received it, but the package was \"misplaced\". It was an important package I needed for a tradeshow the next day. Although the package was never found, the hotel manager did send one of his employees out to purchase a similar item for replacement. One morning, my co-workers and I sat down for breakfast. We were given coffee with our menus. It took about 20 minutes for the waiter to return. When he served our order it was wrong. He was very apologetic and comped the meal, mentioning they were short staffed that morning. It seems as if the hotel staff can make up for their shortgivings, however if you are paying $300+ a night, you shouldn't have to endure a negative experience. I've been very pleased with the Kimpton brand (Hotel Monaco in Denver and Washington, D.C.)so I expected the same level of service at this property. In their defense, it is a fairly new property. However, the hotel business isn't new. If a guest pulls up in a cab, don't walk inside. If a guest is standing at the counter for a few minutes, apologize and welcome them to the hotel. If a guest has a package sent to the hotel, don't lose it. It seems like they need to pay attention to the small details in order to make this a property worth coming back to. Since it's right in the Gaslamp District, there are many others to chose from. I doubt I would stay here again. They had an Omni attached to the ball park, so I may give that a try next time I'm in SD.", "Date": "March 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cA Place to Stay but don't Overpay\u201d", "Author": "cineart", "ReviewID": "UR4368541", "Content": "I don't know what's up with San Diego but it seems that all the hotels in the gaslamp area are charging New York prices. The convention center is very busy with New Orleans convention overflow and any decent place within walking distance of gaslamp is charging about $300/night plus $22 parking. I decided to play Russian roulette with Hotwire and bid a four star gaslamp area hotel for $204/night +taxes (for a Thursday and Friday night stay) I got the Solamar, a new boutique hotel that bills itself as four stars. I\u2019ve read the other reviews here and thought I\u2019d add some comments. The staff was all top notch and I encountered no rude or sub par service as mentioned before. The lobby is well appointed and a nice place to relax and the 4th floor bar is also a nice hangout. The workout room is a joke- the smallest I\u2019ve ever seen with about four pieces of equipment. The pool is also a ridiculous 3\u2019 deep and therefore useless. The hotel is new so the rooms and furnishings are clean. But here is the real point of my review \u2013value. Our room was very, very small \u2013so small that it didn\u2019t have the requisite \u2018two chairs and a table by the window set-up\u2019 in case you wanted to invite a guest up to your room. More importantly, the rooms were poorly insulated. Any seasoned traveler knows the awful sound of heavy fireproof hotel doors slamming early in the morning as Business Bob leaves at 6:30AM for a meeting. We could hear next-door conversations and the maid vacuuming at 8:00AM very clearly. All of this does not fit in my definition of a four star hotel. Yes the room was decorated in a funky hip style. But with the room size and noise it felt like the Solamar built regular, small and acoustically sub par rooms and then hired a decorator to do an \u2018extreme makeover\u2019 adding drapes, some funky lamps and art. That just doesn\u2019t cut it for their regular $300/night rates. At $204 I felt neither screwed nor did I feel I got any value. If I paid just $5 more a night I might have been pissed. The lobby and bar may look four star but after all I am paying for a room. I\u2019d stay here again but if I had to pay $300 I\u2019d choose the Marriot Gas lamp (NOT the other Marriot monster convention hotel by the water!!) The Marriot Gas lamp may not have a basin type Kohler sink and funky drapes but the standard rooms are big, immaculate, and have an equally unique California Craftsman style about it.
