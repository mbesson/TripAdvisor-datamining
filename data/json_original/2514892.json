We spent a beautiful three days in Paris, and the hotel is so wonderfully charming that it entices one to linger, even though the city's sightseeing beckons. The Hotel sits within a cozy courtyard, in a classic French building, which used to house and old abbey. It is inviting to pause in the warmly decorated sitting room before venturing further. Our room was of good size - there are larger rooms if one is willing to pay a bit more- with a large window overlooking the courtyard, chintzy fabrics and a cozy bed that made us want to sleep late. Perhaps the best part was breakfast, which is served in the elegant conservatory, or in fair weather, the incredibly charming garden. A continental breakfast is included in the price of the room, which is not common in Paris, while everything else on the menu is a la carte and very delicious. There was a regal assortment of breads and pastries, and the cafe au lait was divine! The hotel is conveniently located, close to St. Germain Boulevard, great restaurants and metro stations. We have been to Paris several times and stayed in many good hotels, but this one is, by far, the most memorable one.

It's also convenient, close to good restaurants and the subway and one can easily walk to various attractions (great Luxembourg gardens, perfect for children with marionette shows and extensive activities). We have already stayed twice in this hotel and do not regret our choice: it will be our home away from home when in Paris. The staff is attentive and can recommend restaurants, help make reservations etc. The breakfast in the morning is continental only but fresh with a great choice of pastries and breads. Only little downside is that while the owners schedule regular updates of rooms, if you stay in a room which is coming up for a renovation, things may look a bit tired or less crisp/polished than in the newer rooms.

They were not incorrect. In the week that we were in Paris, I cannot recall one instance where the staff were anything other than helpful and courteous. While my daughter is fluent in french, I, alas, have descended into mediocrity (perhaps in many things). That having been said, the staff never let me feel handicapped for a second. They transitioned from french to english seamlessly, even tolerating my amalgam of french, english and latin. A word, if you will, about the left vs. the right bank. I favor the former, because of the intimacy and ability to live in neighborhoods as opposed to the broad avenues across the river. To be sure, there are adherents to both locales; the left asks you to accommodate smaller rooms due to the intimacy of the real estate. I find this an acceptable trade off for the ambiance and location. However, this is a personal decision.

Start with the walk to Cafe Cassette right down the street, sit down and grab a nice glass of white wine or coffee and watch the world go by. Or, walk 10 minutes to the Odeon area with great restaurants, nightlife and gelato! And of course, for tourists, walk 30 minutes to see the Louvre and Notre Dame. For everything else, the Saint Sulpice metro station is steps away from the hotel and connects you with all of Paris. We stayed in a standard room on the 4th floor, with a nice view of the inner courtyard, terraces and the beautiful buildings in the area. The room was immaculate and was very intimate and cozy, which was perfect for a romantic trip to Paris. Even though it was on the small side, it was exactly what we needed - a bed, enough room for luggage, a desk and a bathroom w/ tub. Only complaint - a shower curtain would have been nice! if you're in Paris, you're hopefully not spending a long time in your room during the day. The front desk was wonderful. We could either speak our broken French or our English with the front desk - either will work just fine. One night, we needed help with a dinner reservation - they suggested an excellent place down the street and booked our reservation for us.

I see the attraction of being there before the major crowds, but in retrospect would either A)taken a tour or B) have waited for the 10- something train. It's beautiful, but we really didn't need 4 hours there, and getting up early took away from the \"vacation\" feel. Also be warned that the bus that makes trips between Giverney and the train station does NOT go back for every train.

Despite our efforts we simply could not get a descent room. One room was facing a wall, another was so small we could not fit a suitcase, and yet another had twin beds where we asked for a double.

The bathroom was very modern with a marble & glass shower with great water pressure.

Each afternoon we came home to a nice fire in the fireplace. The location is perfect - down a side street set back by an inner courtyard. At night we heard nothing. It is amazing to me to be located in the heart of Paris and to hear no city noise - traffic, sirens, garbage trucks, etc. - We slept great. The front desk staff were very helpful. We worked mostly with Mr. Rossignol & he was terrific - very pleasant & always eager to help. I almost hate to say anything negative but to go from very good to perfect the things I would change are the following: 1) have slippers available in the room - it would be nice to get out of the shower throw on your robe & have breakfast in your room without putting on shoes or walking barefoot on the carpet, 2) provide plusher less scratchy towels & sheets, 3) make sure the amenities are replinished - we had only 1 small bottle of evian in our room for 4 days - it would have been nice to have a bottle each day for taking pills or quenching your thirst without having to remember to stop & buy one - on several days our shampoos, etc. were not replaced, 4) place a nice french chocolate on the pillow at turndown & 5) have some afternoon treat available in the lobby i.e. hot chocolate & madelines - Yes, these are small things & in no way would stop me from returning - But I think these above & beyond niceties would place this hotel in a category with other 4 star American hotels.", "Date": "October 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cA perfect hotel, and a perfect stay in a most beautiful city.\u201d", "Author": "SweetShepherd", "ReviewID": "UR80902227", "Content": "The Hotel de l' Abbaye was everything we could have asked for in a hotel.

At 260E per night I would have expected a bed more than 6 foot long, some bottled water, a proper shower \u2013 not a hand held shower over a tiny bath with no shower screen, a breakfast that included more than a thimble of juice, coffee and croissants, access to a gym, toiletries replenished daily, etc. Sadly, all these were lacking when I stayed there. On the other hand the hotel does have free wireless internet included although, as another reviewer has noted, it is not user friendly. And being able to open the windows for fresh air is a plus even if this means exposing the room to the inevitable noise which comes with living in the high density Parisian inner city. L\u2019Abbaye would probably suit deaf little old ladies who like chintzy furnishings and who feel comfortable in claustrophobic surroundings.

At one breakfast my waiter actually coughed over the place settings as he plonked them on the table with indifference. And a two person elevator in a refurbished building \u2013 what can the French be thinking? The location of the hotel is not bad \u2013 only 5 minutes walk from my favourite Parisian store: La Bon Marche, and 30+ minute walk down Rue de Rennes and Rue Bonaparte to a bridge across the Seine to the Louvre. Alternatively, the Saint Sulspice metro stop is only around the corner, but several train changes may be required to reach typical tourist destinations and the Paris metro can be difficult to navigate.

We had a corner room overlooking the courtyard, kept the window cracked open at night, all was quiet yet we could wake to the flocks of birds chirping each morning. The room was bright and cheery, the furnishings were tasteful, the thread count of the sheets was as high as it gets, the curtains were of high quality silk with ingrained blackout materials, and surprisingly all our luggage and clothes were neatly stowed away in the three tiny closets. In fact, tiny as it was, we have never been more comfortable and at home in a hotel room. The wireless worked well and the flat panel t.v. had a variety of international channels. Breakfast was simple, but again first rate: freshly squeezed juice, a variety bread basket of crackling fresh sourdough and croissants, and excellent coffee. I never would have believed that I would be so satisfied with what the French term a 4* hotel (1/3 less in size than normal international standard).

It is indeed small, however, it is liveable for one person. For two people it may feel closed in although the Verneuil's standard rooms are even smaller. I read reports about the tranquility, however, there is foot noise on the stone courtyard that can be heard in the room as well as the walls are thin, and the room is bang on the hallway so noise from the stairs and elevator can be heard. The bathroom is small but marble and lovely. For a 4* hotel I do not understand the lack of a minibar and the tiny almost useless hairdryer. As for the service the desk clerks are all right. I would say they do their jobs efficiently but nothing outstanding to set them apart from other hotels in lower categories. Some of the busboys are very attentive, and they are unique.

The included breakfast was wondeful, and we took advantage of the all-windowed lanai with tables that looked out to the back courtyard. Very unhurried breakfast, again pleasant and overly helpful staff. Fresh-squeezed OJ, good coffee, a varied assortment of croissants etc and daily newspapers in a variety of laguages just right to start your day. One night we had purchased champagne from a cellar visit & not only did they chill it for us, but later that night offered to set us up outside in the courtyard to enjoy the bottle. We took them up on it and a server promptly took us outside & brought the bottle, complete with a spread of snacks & poured it. Everyone was so sincerely nice & gentle and the hotel is small, so they know who the guests are. This is not a big faceless chain with a bustling front desk. They say the metro is a 2 minute walk-- it is literally not even a block away & with 1 connection, we were able to access pretty much all the major spots. A second metro line is a couple blocks away as well. Within the neigborhood are some great restaurants, shopping, clean streets, nice upscale area. The hotel itself is 1 street behind the busy one, so you can easily keep the windows open without noise issues. St Germain is also in walking distance, about 15 min walk.

I didn't book until late April for an early June trip so I was thankful they had two rooms available (I may have gotten the last two). This is an absolutely charming hotel in a terrific location. We had the \"classic\" rooms (standard) which were perfectly lovely and actually pretty spacious by European standards! Our two rooms were located across from each other, and then there was an \"apartment\" door that led to our little enclave. Very private, actually. We could have both bedroom doors open, while having the \"apartment\" door locked. Nice bathrooms and very pretty bedspreads and curtains. There are, I believe, more \"deluxe\" rooms available and four suites (duplex apartments) too, but we were very happy with our \"classic rooms\". Our daughters loved the hotel too! They have traveled a lot and are pretty discriminating-especially for 18 year olds! They, too, appreciated all the charm and service at the hotel. There is a lovely little courtyard in back, and we awoke to the sounds of a small fountain and birds every morning!

I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. STAFF: The staff was so friendly and courteous from the moment we walked in to the moment we checked out. ROOM: Our room was the \"Classic Room\". It was a medium sized room with charming linens and drapes. There were 2 twin sized beds pushed very close together but I still feel like we had ample room. We each had our own closet to hang our clothes and there was an additional closet with the safe and extra storage. The bathroom was fantastic - very modern and comfortable and with shelves to hold our toiletries. There was NOT an iron or ironing board - but the hotel does offer clothes pressing service. There was a hair dryer. AND, there is FREE WI-FI internet access which is a nice added bonus. FOOD: Our stay included breakfast which we ate outside in the wonderful garden. Our breakfast was coffee or tea, fresh squeezed blood orange juice, and an assortment of croissants and rolls with jams. LOCATION: the location is perfect! The St. Sulpice metro station is a block away - this was the cheapest and easiest way to get to Paris - this train takes you to the Chatelet stop in Paris which is a block or two away from the Seine. The hotel is also near the Jardins du Luxembourg which were absolutely beautiful. The area was a very nice, chic area of Paris. We felt very safe there as well. PRICE: our room cost us each approx $150 USD/night. It was well worth it - the hotel is so charming and exquisite and the location is just right. OVERALL: I would go back to this hotel in a heartbeat - it was such a positive, wonderful experience. Our host, Midi (not sure how to spell his name was FANTASTIC.

Walking into the hotel we immediately got a warm and effusive welcome in English by the smiling staff and were ushered into the conservatory/lounge to drink coffee and take breakfast, where there is a cozy fireplace, plenty of magazines and a very charming little bar. Everything was taken care of with warmth and smiles, which we appreciated. The hotel staff are very knowledgeable and can help advise you if its your first trip to Paris or your 50th.The room we were given was very small, but you are paying for lacation I suppose here. May well be worth looking into a next level up room- we had a classic ( lowest tier I suppose) room. The rooms themselves though small are immaculate with Fragonard toiletries, fresh towels and great sheets.The only issue we had with our room was the hand shower which made it difficult to shower quickly. Try to get a room overlooking the courtyard these are lovely-most of the rooms have French windows so you wake up to the sound of birds chirping, water trickling in the fountain of the courtyard below and the smell of fresh coffee thats being served in the garden below at breakfast. The room rate includes standard continental breakfast: as much cafe au lait as you can drink ( strong, good quality and very hot- one can always judge a hotel by the quality of coffee and toiletries) , fresh juice, fresh pastries and great french croissant. A hot breakfast in extra but is available. The best feature of the hotel is the lounge, and salon area which dobles as a bar in the evenings, and extends out to a glass conservatory in the mornings where they serve breakfast. This is not a hotel if you want a gym, business centre, coffee shop convenience type experience. Its nostalgic, stylish and very romantic!The area itself is around the corner from cafe flore and l'eglise de st germain, both Parisian landmarks.These are surrounded by a host of fantastic boutiques & cafes on Rue bonaparte, whilst candle, perfume, lingerie, chocolate and pastry shops abound: all gorgeous, but quite , ahem, expensive! be sure to take a terrasse outside the st germain church if you can or stop by for lunch at brasserie colombier which is just down the road near st sulpice M stop, both are very local hangouts. All things considered , we will definitely return to the Abbaye!", "Date": "April 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cWonderful!\u201d", "Author": "LikeToTravelTill100", "ReviewID": "UR27126753", "Content": "This is the 4th time I have stayed here and as usual, the service was great, the staff were helpful, and the whole hotel experience was wonderful.

This small boutique gem of a property is everything its website promises and MORE! I admit I was drawn in by its luxurious feel, combined with its historical significance as a former site of an abbey/monastery. The tour on the hotel's website is absolutely accurate, and if not for the different flowers in the vases throughout the property, I could submit my own photos and you would see they align perfectly. In fact, I am submitting mine so you can see there is no embellishment at all. I used email to ask questions, and the staff very promptly and professionally responded, assuring me of their competence and utmost warmth. Actually, I often travel to Italy because in part the people are so wonderful, but these folks were divine in every way. I booked the entire trip with a few emails and one phone call, and we were off to France two days later for a three day weekend. We were Mom and two daughters, ages 12 and 17. We stayed in the lovely classic room pictured, and had a rollaway bed brought to augment the sleeping arrangements. This cost an extra 76 Euros per day, declared clearly by the staff during my preparations, bringing the total to 308Euros per night for a three night special, including taxes and breakfasts for three each day. No surprises at all with my bill upon checkout. Voila! Fresh orchids daily, fresh aromatic blooms in the common areas, fresh flowers planted in the outdoor gardens (even though we had a bit of snow(!) Feb 2), warm wood fires, and delightful staff attended to our every need in an unobtrusive way. The bedding was first rate, our room was cleaned impeccably and often, and entirely discreetly. My girls loved the WiFi and used their iPod Touch for internet throughout the hotel (free) as well as a desktop available near the front desk to check in for flights. We enjoyed champagne and chocolates by the fire as I played cards with my 12 year old, and YUMMY breakfasts by the water fountains in the garden area with coffee as intense and indulgent as any in Italy. The staff sent us for local dining at Cafe Cassette steps away. We loved it and returned to this NON-tourist cafe. Though we speak only a bit of French, we got along with some Italian, some French and some English. Staff at the hotel was always entirely fluent in English. Walking in the 6th Arr. is safe, quaint, and filled with every shop three gals could manage in three days. We could walk 3 minutes to the museum Luxembourg, and cabs were around to go to Notre Dame, which cost only about 6 Euros. The Car Rouge open top on-off buses run from there, all around town. We took the 9:00 P.M. Cruise down the Seine (10 Euros per adult, half for kids) and were mesmerized by Paris at night! The stores are CLOSED SUNDAYS, which was a shock, but we entertained ourselves wonderfully at teatime at LADUREE at 21 Rue Bonaparte, just a ten minute walk from our hotel. We bought their world-renowned macaroons to take home, too, after nearly collapsing from pure bliss overload upon the first bite. Long lines, but worth every second for the bakery take-out. The tea-room upstairs was gorgeous. Overall, the Hotel de l'Abbaye was divine, made us feel pampered and cherished, and truly I hope that I can get a reservation again when I return to Paris. We are so grateful for a spectacular, safe, and luxurious weekend.

Great log fire and a plethora of reading material to cosy up to on plush sofas. Then there was the staff who could not have been any nicer. They did their utmost to ensure our comfort.

I am sure this was just a fluke and, in any case, my other half obligingly swapped with me. But for the price of the room, I would have expected beds to be in tip-top shape I know folks on here have raved about the breakfast but it was nothing special.

We went elsewhere for my morning cappuccino and it would have been nice to have had a decent cup with my croissant - this is Paris after all.

My husband prefers a 5 star hotel that has American type amenities like a stall shower and big screen TVs. My daughter and I don't care about the stars, we want something with personality, charm and lots of nearby strolling opportunities. We booked two rooms - one standard, which had two twin beds and a bath with handheld shower. Very charming, very comfortable - a little roomier than the European standard. The other room was a suite and it was just huge! It was actually a duplex with one floor having a small parlor with TV, couch, easy chair, desk and a full bath with tub and shower stall. The upstairs had a very roomy bedroom, queen size bed, half bathroom (just a toilet /sink) and a terrace that looked over the courtyard with two chairs and a table. Charming!!!! And the bathroom turned out to be my husband's favorite ever - heated floor in the shower, real water pressure, gorgeous marble. Not to mention that all TVs were large, flat panel. I heartily agree with previous posts that mention how very special the service is, on this level they can compete with any 5 star. And the public spaces for breakfast / evening cocktail / relaxation are great too. One very small criticism - the beds were just average in terms of comfort. The mattresses were quite firm and the sheets had that starched feeling, something I thought had gone out of style a long time ago. We had stayed at a Sofitel in Dijon the night before and while that is a very businessy hotel, the beds were incredible. Since Sofitel sells these mattresses through a brochure, I would suggest that the L'Abbaye grab a few of them ASAP. Well worth the price, even the upgrade cost for the suite.", "Date": "February 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Duxbury, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cThe Jewel of the Left Bank\u201d", "Author": "bordeux", "ReviewID": "UR13682680", "Content": "My wife and I visited Paris for the first time this month and stayed at the Hotel L'Abbaye.

The room was very clean and considerably spacious for a smaller hotel. The cleaning service was like clock work everyday, cleaning the room and also providing turn down service in the evening. The common areas of the hotel are the highlight. The sitting area by the fireplace is beautiful and the court yard with the small water fountain is very tranquil if the weather is warm enough to sit out there. There is ample sitting areas where you have breakfast in the morning and a glass of wine in the evening. The staff at this hotel is extremely professional and accomodating.

Although close to the cafes and restaurants of Saint Germain and even closer to the useful Saint Sulpice metro station (and only about 10 minutes walk to the Seine), the hotel is an oasis of peace and quiet set around a lovely little courtyard. We paid extra for a large room and had a delightful ground floor room with its own little conservatory (containing 2 chairs and table with fruit basket) and its own little garden (with another 2 chairs and table), both of which overlooked the courtyard. Despite being in the heart of the city the only noise we could hear was birdsong! The staff are all friendly and helpful and speak perfect English (but were also prepared to humour my attempts to communicate with them in French!) and we would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay somewhere a bit special. Breakfast in the main conservatory is recommended (try the hot chocolate, it may not sound particularly breakfasty but is to die for, trust me!) as is afternoon tea in the lounge (in front of a real fire if like us you visit during the winter months). Beyond the hotel we only had time to do the cheesy touristy things (Louvre, Bateaux Mouches cruise, up the Eiffel Tower, dinner/show at the Lido, walks along the Seine), all of which were hugely enjoyable and are highly recommended, but hardly \"hidden gems\"!!

Based upon the strong recommendation of a colleague from work and the Trip Advisor ratings (at that time Hotel de l\u2019Abbaye was ranked #10) I made a reservation for four nights. After being stuck on the ground at JFK Airport for nearly 7 hours due to an ice storm we arrived in Paris after spending 13 \u00bd hours in the plane. When we reached the hotel we knew we\u2019d made a great choice. You walk through two large doors into the cobblestone courtyard and enter a series of charming common rooms \u2013 one with a working fireplace. At reception we were greeted warmly and whisked up to our room. As soon as we got there our frustration and disappointment of losing most of our first day in Paris melted away. As our tickets were so cheap, I splurged and booked one of their duplex suites. It was like we had our own private apartment on the Left Bank. There was a welcome note from the hotel\u2019s manager and a basket of incredible fresh fruit. Paris rewarded us with early Spring weather \u2013 high 50\u2019s and low 60\u2019s and sunny. So we were able to use the balcony of our room every day to eat breakfast or lunch or have drinks. The Hotel de l\u2019Abbaye was exactly the type of hotel we\u2019ve been looking for in Paris. On prior trips we\u2019ve stayed on the Ile St. Louis and large \u201cinstitutional\u201d hotels on the Right Bank. L\u2019Abbaye is smaller and more intimate in a terrific location. It is close to several Metro stations and different lines as well as the shops and sights of St. Germain des Pres. At the same time at night it was extremely quiet \u2013 we used to live in NYC and we could not believe we were in the heart a major city. Because the weather was so warm the windows in the apartments across the street were open and we could hear their conversations. I can\u2019t say enough for the service we received. I booked the room using the hotel\u2019s website. The staff was very responsive and helpful. I also communicated with the staff regarding restaurant reservations. They were able to get us into each restaurant we requested. When a restaurant was booked for one day, they worked with me on alternative times that fit our schedule. They also suggested a local restaurant for dinner on Sunday night (when many restaurants in Paris are closed) and it turned out to be an excellent meal. Our room was spotlessly cleaned each day, and we enjoyed the complimentarily continental breakfast which is an additional charge at most Paris hotels. And the desk staff was very friendly and accommodating. I speak a bit of French and they indulged me by communicating in French. My wife doesn\u2019t speak any French and they effortlessly switched between English and French when she was with me. The hotel was the perfect spot for us to start our walking tours of various parts of Paris. And a welcome home to return to.

This was confirmed by the front desk. I found a paid wifi service on my arrival. I was then told there was free wired Internet but the wall jacks in both rooms in which I stayed were dummies (no connection pins). The manager gave me a very limited time wifi card in compensation; I ended up spending an extra 150 euros over my stay (I didn't bother trying to get this back as work paid, but still vexing). - The included breakfast is very limited; a hot drink, and small glass of juice, and some pastries/bread/jam.

This was a special trip with my daughter -- an introduction to the city I love so much and I wanted to make it very special. I'd stayed in a few hotels in the 6th on business, but was intrigued by the reviews I read on Trip Advisor. I researched hotels extensively and Hotel de L'Abbaye was simply the most logical choice. THe hotel is GREAT. The street is very quiet and residential, yet just a half block off the busy Rue de Rennes. It's 5 mins maxby foot to the St Sulpice Metro, 10 mins to St. Germain and about a 15 min walk to the Seine (but I walk fast). The cobblestone entry courtyard is charming. While the hotel is in an old building and has the exceptional charm of a well kept small Parisian hotel, I didn't see any antique elements like wooden beams or stone walls that I'd seen at other small hotels in the 6th. That was ok with me. It's very tidy and well appointed. We were on the third floor overlooking the courtyard. The room was small, but I knew that in advance. The bathroom comparatively was grand. The staff was quiet friendly and allowed me to speak French and spoke French back which was generous. THey were helfpul with restaurant recommendations and with other suggestions during our visit. There were a number of French in the hotel during our stay which was nice to see. THe other hotels I'd stayd at in the 6th were a bit noisy and Hotel de L'Abbaye was no exception. I could hear toilets flushing and other plumbing sounds, but thankfully no talking! It was not a major nuisance and that's part of the charm! THe Luxembourg Gardens -- my hangout in school -- is quite close and there are loads of great restaurants and shipping nearby (as well as one of the city's best patisseries on Rue Bonaparte -- can't remember the name! but it's just a half block N of Place St. Sulipice on the left.. Shopping is great too. I would highly recommend Hotel de L'Abbaye to anyone. It is delightful.

The standard room @ 199E is miniscule, and the carpet in our room, number 20, was badly stained along the foot of the beds (as it turns out, the only place you can really \"walk\" inside the room.) The bathroom was adequate and kept meticulously clean. The daily petit dejeuner that comes included with the price of the room became a bit boring and repetitive after a few days, although the room/s in which it is served are lovely. The breakfast consisted of coffee/tea, orange juice and a small basket of bread (baguette, croissant, sweet roll). The addition of fruit and/or yogurt would be a real plus.
