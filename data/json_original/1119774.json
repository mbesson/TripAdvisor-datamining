He continued to be helpful throughout our stay and even went out of his way to help us charge our iPod when we realized we forgot the charger. Our Superior room was large by any standard, North American or otherwise. It was decorated in a modern, but comfortable style. Our bathroom was just insane. The pictures we saw on TA were the reason we stayed here, and why you should too. A few notes: - People that complain about the noise are crazy. We did notice that you can faintly hear some music in the room during the day, but it seemed to be coming from a bar that closed around 9pm. - The shower in our bathroom had no edges to it, so the entire bathroom basically flooded every time we showered. Not that big a deal since they provided us with slippers, but still a bit annoying. Maybe it's done that way to make it wheelchair friendly? - They charge a reasonable fee for wireless internet access in the room.

Firstly the positives - the location was excellent, tucked down a side street overlooking a quaint canal and only 4 minutes from St Marco's square. Now for the negatives: Obviously, if you have been to Venice before you will know that it is an expensive city so one cannot quibble on price as their rates are pretty par for the course. HOWEVER, as for the rooms, the suite and upgraded room we stayed in on our last night were quite small even by Venice standards and not exactly well designed either. The boring and lackluster decoration aside, there was no air con in either of our rooms and only a heating system. This meant that we baked and woke up each morning with headaches. Please bear in mind that this was only April so heaven knows how this will be in the summer!! The one night we decided to cool the room down by opening the windows, was the same night we were attacked by three mosquitoes and bitten from head to toe. My second fault is with the breakfast. If you go expecting a gourmet feast befitting of a 4 star hotel, you will be very disappointed. Every effort was made to make the breakfast as cheap as possible - day old bread rolls, sweaty cheese in small plastic wrappers, orange juice made from concentrate and horribly cheap jams. Fine for a 2 star hotel but not a 4 star one. My final complaint is with the staff - we found them to be aloof at times, bordering on the arrogant and not very helpful at all. On are final day we asked one of the guys to tell us where we could catch a water bus to the airport from - a common request you might think but he told us the wrong bus stop and we almost missed our plane! Overall, we had hoped for something more special for this part of our minimoon, but the hotel itself is very forgettable and indeed, considering the nights' sleep we had and the service we got, this is probably no bad thing.

We went into the room, which I remembered seeing online and didn't even consider it to be one of our choices to stay its also lower starred hotel. The room was vile to say the least and had no view what so ever. You would think that if you had to put customers in another hotel you would at least give them a nice room. We were not happy and went back next door and told the receptionist and he said there are no rooms tonight, but tomorrow you can have a complimentary upgrade to an executive room over looking the canal. Still quite annoyed that we were not staying in the hotel we booked and paid for we thought fine we will have a nice room tomorrow. Come the next day we went to the reception and was told to wait for the director as he want to speak to us. There was me thinking he was going to apologise, but much to my disbelief he turned around and said \"there were no rooms in this hotel, next door is our sister hotel you have to stay there!\" Dumbfounded I asked him to explain why and he wouldn't so I asked for a refund for both nights as I wasn't getting what I had paid for. He had a little chat with the receptionist and suddenly there was a room available! We took the room thinking it would be the so called upgrade we were offered the day before.

The occasion was the birthday of my husband and our wedding anniversary. We were not sure to go to Venice in August but finally it was a very good timing. It was not too crowded and the perfect location of the hotel allowed us to wake up early and few minutes later being on San Marco before the daily tourists arrived. The street of the hotel is calm and lovely with its canal in the middle of the old city and out of the mass at the same time. Cristina and Alberto made our stay perfect with their suggestion for restaurants and a little explanation of Venetians life. Our room was decorated with last design furniture and the bathroom has beautiful glass mosaics. Jacuzzi in our bathroom was a top on the comfort. Delicious Italian breakfast, original ceiling frescos and real mosaic floors all are there. I told already to all my friends and colleagues to reserve this hotel whenever they go to Venice.", "Date": "October 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location - our favorite hotel in Italy!\u201d", "Author": "Jennall", "ReviewID": "UR45452602", "Content": "We did a lot of research on all of our hotels and were very pleasantly surprised with the Ai Due Principi. We were only in Venice for two nights but this was by far our favorite hotel in Italy. The hotel is only 6 months old, our room was brand new - the bathroom was very large, great shower (we were randomly given the handicap room on the first floor) and the staff were very helpful and nice with recommendations. Breakfast was included which was ok; we aren't breakfast eaters so coffee and some toast worked for us. The location is right by St. Mark's Square which is great and convenient for everything. Beautiful city. Will definitely recommend to all our friends and would stay here again!", "Date": "September 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "cyprus", "Title": "\u201cperfect\u201d", "Author": "lovec33", "ReviewID": "UR38860089", "Content": "The staff was very friendly & helpfull.
