Check in was a breeze and I have to say that the staff were quick, efficient and prompt. When I asked if they could call the Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge to check if my missing cell phone had been handed in they said the concierge would handle it. I spoke to the duty concierge Kate and she got straight onto it and checked for me which was great stating she would contact me or leave message of the results. Great, I go do some touristy things and come back to retrieve a message from the TV message board and not being able to access the second page of the message without the service have a coronary and stalling. Hotel reception printed the message for me and I go hunting for the afternoon concierge who was not available on several visits to the desk but on the third attempt Rodolfo contacted Jasper and organised for the phone to be shipped home to Australia. That was the brilliant and good side. I went to use the in house restaurant last night ( April 18 ) and was advised that there was a wait as a private function had taken over most of the restaurant and only the lounge are was available. I was welcome to wait at the bar till a table become free. No problems with that my problem was that hotel patrons staying here were not warned that the restaurant had limited service and also that the bar area was lit only by the lights behind the bar and the lounge area by candles only. No overhead lighting till it came back on mid meal and after the other part of the restaurant was being broken down after the private event. Perhaps I expect too much being used to Asian hotels where if there is an issue like that the guests are warned beforehand. This is the only real problem I have had with this hotel and noted it on the feedback form for the restaurant. It is not the staff's fault but it is something management needs to look in the further for consideration to the other hotel guests. One thing I have to say is that the staff make this hotel more than the location and the price to eat at the hotel is a little on the high side. Good restaurants are near by.

It's a fine hotel with much to commend it. The location is prime. Within minutes you can walk the heart of downtown, Stanley Park, or, across the street, to the Skytrain station or Seabus to the North Shore. Speaking of the North Shore, the views of the mountains across Burrard Inlet from this hotel are sensational! Ask for a higher floor - I stayed on the 15th this past trip - and request one of the corner \"Signature\" suites which command exquisite views from no less than three beautiful vantages -- east towards the Second Narrows and Mt Seymour, and west towards the Lions Gate Bridge, Coal Harbour and Stanley Park. Even the spacious bathroom has a dynamite view of the harbour and Vancouver's North Shore mountains!!! The service at this hotel is warm and welcoming. From the valets and bell hops who greet you with a \"welcome back\" when you come back through the doors of the lobby, to the front desk and housekeeping staff, this hotel can pride itself on polished customer service. Personally I much prefer the Waterfront to the neighbouring Fairmont hotel, the Pacific Rim. Though the Rim is newer and more glamourous, it lacks the charm, warmth and sophistication of the Waterfront. Chacon son gout. I like the calm and spacious lobby and the open but quieter more polished feel of the Waterfront's beautiful Heron's restaurant and bar.

A friend was taking me, so I did not need it, but when I got back, they asked how I was. In the morning I got a call from the general manager and the front desk person asking how I was doing. It was amazing and made me smile. Then this afternoon a small knock on the door announced a visit from a staff member bringing me honey and chocolates and a note to ask how I was feeling. Wow!

Great welcome, we were already checked in given keys by the bellmen and headed up to the room. Room is lovely, spacious, spotless and appears recently redone. Fairmont has recently changed their amenities, now from Le Labo and I really like them. First of all I'll tell the good about the Gold Floor. Staff are very very friendly and if you ask them for something they'll do their best to make it happen, remembered our names right from day one (I'm in night three of a four night stay). Great breakfast, excellent nespresso machine, and although advertised as deluxe continental there is always sausage, bacon hashbrowns and another entree ie: quiche, eggs benny etc. Evening snacks have been very good - oriental one night with dumplings, sushi etc, another spanakopita, meatballs etc and always a cheese tray. Honour bar of course if crazy priced. A glass of the red wine they have is more than the cost of the bottle, which we don't like anyway. I went out and got us a nice bottle of Deadly Zins and we took up our own. No one said anything. On the flip side my biggest beef would be that the staff really aren't \"there\" in the lounge. Dishes sit waiting to be cleared for a long time, in the morning only once have I been offered a coffee refill without getting it myself and my biggest peeve is that there is no milk/cream on the tables, only in jugs in one area so if I have a pot of tea every time I pour a cup I have to get up and carry it over to add milk. I have had to knock on the kitchen door several times to get butter etc. Also, their games selection, not even a pack of cards was lackluster which is disappointing as most floors have these. Thirdly was the magazine selection which was nil - only free magazines were on display. There was a BMW out front with the hotel logo and hubbie asked how he could drive it and was told that he couldn't drive it, but it was courtesy car for hotel guests and if we wanted a ride somewhere, or a pickup we could be driven for free. We did do this last night and got a bit of a tour of downtown which was well worth the $5 tip. It is one of those hidden services though, I haven't seen it advertised. Hubbie also love the free pressing service, saved a few minutes in the morning. I do want to stress that the staff could not have been more accomodating, professional and kind - fix the stuff above and there is nothing I could complain about (which is pretty rare for me ;) Hands down, beats the Hyatt - no comparison in service at all which is crazy as my husband has stayed there every week or two for the last year.

It is in a great location on the Vancouver waterfront -- with remarkable views of the North Shore mountains, the harbour and one of the world's great cities. I have never been overly impressed with the lobby of the hotel -- it tries to be stately, but it ends up being cavernous. The rooms are very nice -- large and well-appointed. If you can get a waterfront/mountain view, you will simply love the setting -- particularly on one of the 10 days a year when it is not raining or cloudy :) The entrance way for first floor area, tied to large and useful conference facilities is a little off-putting, however. The staff are very helpful and highly professional -- this place knows how to hire the right people! My reservation was lost (always the possibility I forgot to make one). There was not great panic and they accommodated me very quickly. Efficient, friendly and knowledgeable staff make a huge difference when traveling, and they can make an average hotel property soar in my estimation. The Fairmont, at all of their properties, gets top marks for this. But I have one large complaint, and not just about this hotel. I am really tired of being charged extra for the Internet. In my case, the basic Internet -- not sufficient for properly downloads -- was covered as part of the conference package. But I really dislike the rigamarole of launching the website, filling in the forms, adding one's visa card, etc. Surely we are past this by now. Having full and proper high speed Internet at no incremental cost is a no-brainer in this day and age. Lowe end business hotels do it.

At check-in, we were greeted by a professional and warm young girl who explained everything to us and made us feel really welcome. Our luggage was taken care of by a porter, and we hopped in another lift and up we went. The view we were hit with was amazing. We had a window facing Vancouver Harbour, with a brilliant view of the docking ships and the busy-ness below. It was really beautiful, and I spend a good 15 minutes taking photo after photo to try and capture the scene perfectly. The 1st thing that my mother discovered with a look that could only be discribed as \"sheer joy\", was that the beds seem to open up their arms and totally embrace you whenever you laid down. These are the best beds I have ever slept on in my life. We were both quite jet-lagged and decided to take a \"nap\" at 10am and woke up at 6:30pm... I blame the amazingly comfortable beds :) When we finally got ourselves out of bed, and started feeling really hungry, we crossed the road and had a meal at Aqua Riva which I highly recommend. After that we came back and had a cup of tea in the hotel restaurant/bar area. It was really relaxing and there is wifi down there so I got to update my travel blog while waiting for my tea to cool. Anything I called the staff about was never a problem or too hard. I discovered my 'universal adaptor\" wasn't so universal and asked reception if they had one I could borrow. Success! The location itself id ideal, as you are literally parked infront of Canada Place, and from here all the tourist buses frequent and you can can hop on the Hop on Hop Off trolley too, which we did. The sky train was only a block or so away (how we came in) and there are taxi's constantly waiting outside across the road so if you need to get somewhere quickly you can.

We booked the hotel using the American Express FHR program. The hotel was quite easy to find and an easy walk from the water front rail terminal. The front desk staff were friendly and we had very little wait before we were checked in and on our way to our room. We stayed in the king waterfront room category and it was fine (clean and well maintained), but for $400 a night I was expecting more. We booked this category due to the fact that with the FHR the hotel is supposed to upgrade to the next category up if available. The view was nice of the sea planes landing and of the water. We order room service and the burger I ordered was very good my wife's chicken sandwich was dry and flavorless, but with the FHR come an $100 food credit so we ate and went on about or day. When we returned for the night the room was quite hot. We turned the air down to 60F and got ready for bed. We both awoke around 1:00 am with the room still burning up, now faced with the dilemma I calling the front desk, complaining and switching rooms at 1:00 in the morning or sucking it up and going back to bed which is what we did. All in all the stay was fine (aside from the broken air conditioning) for a $100-$150 a night hotel, but as I said this room was $400 a night!! We stayed at an all inclusive Sandels resort for $300 for our honeymoon to put this in perspective. Also the room upgrade, as I said, did not happen and around 11:00 pm we went online to the Fairmont's website and the next room catagory was still very available. Given that we booked this hotel as a \"Fine Hotel and Resort\" all of these factors and the cost for such made the stay very disappointing compared to other hotels through the FHR program. If you're coming to Vancouver stay in the Shangra-La.

The suite was on the 22rd floor (one from the top), overlooking the Harbour and the Conference Centre, with Stanley Park and the Lions Gate Bridge in the background. This waterfront view was absolutely stunning. Our two teenage daughters had one room (with a Queen bed and bathroom with shower) and we had the adjoining room (with a folding Queen bed and full bathroom). The suite was very well-appointed, extremely clean and (because of the enormous picture windows in both rooms overlooking the waterfront) very light and airy. The hotel itself was very stylish, both modern and elegant, with a light and airy feel to the lobby. The Reception and Concierge staff were friendly, approachable, knowledgeable and extremely professional. The hotel also had a health club and an outdoor (heated) pool, situated in a lovely rooftop garden, with bees and hives (but not near the pool!). We ate out in Vancouver for the three nights, but we did have breakfast in the hotel on two occasions: one in the Herons Bar downstairs and once in our room. Breakfast in the Herons Bar was buffet-style, with a wide selection of dishes, including freshly-cooked omelettes made while you waited. Not inexpensive, but you could have as much (or as little) as you wanted of everything. Room service breakfast was served on time and as we requested. One problem we experienced (which had also happened a week before in the Fairmont Lake Louise) was the unexpected \u2018wiping\u2019 of our magnetic door keys. This meant we couldn\u2019t get into the health club and were \u2018challenged\u2019 by a member of staff as to our identity when the key very obviously wasn\u2019t working. Whilst the staff were quite polite, we felt the assumption was that we were \u2018imposters trying it on\u2019 as opposed to guests who had a problem with their card. It was a most unpleasant experience ending with one of the pool staff escorting my wife and daughter back to the room (just to check the room). When new keys were issued at the Reception desk, I was given the counter-intuitive advice that I shouldn\u2019t put the credit-card sized keys anywhere near my credit cards, as this could be causing the problem. But what would one naturally do with credit-card sized keys, but put them in one\u2019s wallet (where other cards are\u2026.). It made me lack confidence in the hotel\u2019s key system (not to keep people out, but to allow them in!) and that the hotel staff felt the problem lay with the guests and not the system itself.

This hotel is in the best location in the whole of Vancouver. Having never stayed in a Fairmont hotel I was expecting great things. I was in a port side room on the 21st storey and what a view. I had Canada Place one side and the Vancouver Sun building on the other side. The best thing about the hotel was the view. When I booked I recieved a free upgrade to the next level room. The staff I spoke to were friendly and helpful. I talked to a member of staff who seamed to know nothing whatsoever about Downtown Vancouver - I know that all hotels have a conciege but I still think that staff should know a bit about the area they are in. The staff on the conciege desk were very helpful, though one advised me as a single woman to go to Lighthouse Park in West Vancouver - which I have been to on a previous trip to Vancouver and I felt it was a lonely place when in a group, in the middle of a sunny day in August. Lighthouse Parlk is a lovely place to go and very convienient because the bus to Horseshoe Bay stops at the end of the park but it can be very lonely especially once you leave the main path. The room itself was huge - two double beds, a huge flat screen TV, desk and chairs. I never managed to get the room warm enough (i used both douvets). There was air conditioning but it seamed to be just consist of a thermostat on the wall. I was disappointed to find the towels were only standard hotel size - I did think that a luxery hotel would have big luxorious towels, but it was not to be. I was more disappointed when I looked closly at the bathroom: - the lightswitch had been screwed on at an angle, with one screw partly hanging out - how tatty! - the bathroom door had two different coloured doorhandles - one was silver and one was gold in colour. To say that the literature in the room talked about little details I felt that little details like this let the room down. The only way to keep any food cool in the room was to use the ice bucket. There ws a fridge but it was also the minibar. The minibar fridge had a tab on the front so that once you had opened it to look anyone knew and I would guess that the items inside were probably electronically tagged/monitored so that if they are moved the front desk know and it automatically charged to the room (WATCH OUT this is happening more and more, especially in posher hotels. Note the word moved - it can still be there but you still get charged). DO NOT under any ciircumstances use there business centre to access the internet - it is 50c a minute - you soon spend a lot of money. I ended up spending $30 over only four days. Use an internet cafe. Apart from the location the only advantage I did find was that when I came back late from a Kenny Chesney concert at Rogers Arena there were still bellmen outside both the Waterfront and the Pan Pacific across the road. The hotel is joined to the waterfront shops which has a selection of diffferent shops including a photographers, newsagents and also restaurants. The tourist infomation is also in the same building but accessed from the far side of the building to the Waterfornt entrance. For me the best thing about this hotel is its location. From here you can walk all the way to Stanley Park (or for the energetic all the way round as well). Just the walk around Canada Place and the Convention Centre is nice, with the views across to North Shore. There is an escalator entrance to Waterfornt station across the road fro the hotel entrance. From Waterfront station you can get on the Seabus to Lonsdale Quay (North Vancouver) to go to Capilano Suspension Bridge and Grouse Mountain, the Canada Line to the airport, the Skytrain and the West Coast Express to various suburbs of Vanocuver. A day pass for all buses, trains, Skytrain and Seabus, which includes North and West Vancouver costs just $9 from tickets machines in all stations.

The rooms, I can say, I will be extremely interested how rooms will look like with the next renovation, whenever that will happen... because now, I found the rooms at par with the expectations of the people getting on & off the cruisers (you can not notice how the average age changes dramatically with the arrival of the ships). Even if I am in my early 40's, I can say that I peaked more at the neighboring property, newer and fancier, or the Shangri-La property.

Checked in fast and went to my 17th floor room. It was huge. Corner room, with fabulous views over the bay one side and the city the other. Huge bed with great pillows and linens. Good sized closet and drawers, TV, refrigerator, good sized desk/chair and armchair. Bathroom well equipped and a good size. Make up mirror with light, hairdryer, soaking tub with shower over, plenty of towels and bathrobe. Good quality toiletries. Safety deposit box in room. Good lighting. Everthing about the room was great....except the charge for wifi. I hate having to pay for wifi - if smaller, cheaper hotels can offer it for free, I fail to see why higher end hotels have to charge for it. And not only was there a 13.95 dollar 24 hour charge, but it was per IP address. I had an iPad and a laptop with me - luckily, I realized and didn't incur almost 28 bucks a day for both of them. If you're a couple staying and have separate devices, these charges would add up. These days, wifi should be a hygiene factor and not an add on. The other thing I'd have changed is the policy re changing linens. I was careful to hang my towels up so they didn't replace them each day (to save water and energy), but then I found a small card, on the third day, on the nightstand over the far side of the bed which said if I didn't want clean linens every day, then I should put the card on the bed. It was such a small card that I hadn't seen it among all the other pads, pens, booklets, etc. They'd be better off actually putting it on the pillow for a guest's arrival. I hate wasting energy and having had clean sheets every day was unnecessary. The staff were all very friendly and the one time I used room service, I was pleased the tip was included in the charge and the person who brought it refused my offer of a tip and told me I'd paid it already in the charge. The room was tucked away in a corner and I didn't hear any noise from other guests, either through walls or the usual foot-fall in the corridors. I didn't use the spa, gym or swimming pool but it all looked well equipped. The location of the hotel is great - just across the road from the waterfront, and about half a mile's walk to Stanley Park, where I hired a bike for the afternoon. The Convention Center is a two minute walk away. There are fast food outlets, coffee shops, a nail bar, and some other souvenir and gift shops beneath the hotel, and access to the Skytrain, which takes you to the airport within 25 minutes. All in all, I couldn't fault the hotel on comfort of stay - but the wifi charges really irritated me.

It has two huge windows on two different walls, so the view from this room is spectacular. You'll see mountains and water in much of the direction you look, but the Pan Pacific Hotel was erected so that you also see that as part of your view. The style of the rooms is slightly bland and dated, and the bathroom could definitely use some finery added to it, i.e., the bathtub sits amidst tile placed in such a simple and slightly haphazard way (it is not expensive tile, but looks very inexpensive) that it is not a great \"bath experience\" if you like to sit and soak in the bathtub for any length of time. Basically the staff was very helpful and accommodating and the first day we arrived we gave the concierge a hard time trying to figure out what we were going to do that night, and they kept their cool as we called them a number of times and asked a lot of questions (this was a last minute trip for us so we were not the most organized). That said, one of the concierge staff told us there were no sharks in the water because the waters were too cold for sharks (there are five different species there) and another told us there were no ferries in Vancouver! I know why he said this, as the ferries don't run directly from the waterfront, but the \"sea bus\" does, which is really a ferry that looks like a bus. We were watching the \"sea bus\" go out into the water as we were talking on the phone with the concierge who insisted there was no ferry. I think the concierge folks are not trained as well as they could be -- generally young and a bit green. Also, the hot tub is not usable. It is indoors, and has two doors on one wall of the room it is housed in that lead to outside where the pool is and are clearly meant to be open for ventilation purposes. We went into the tub and our eyes were watering horribly within one minute due to the chlorine in the air in the room. We called the front desk and asked if they could open the doors up, and were told they wouldn't do that anymore because someone accidentally walked into the tub from outside and didn't see it there, so it had now been deemed a security problem to open the doors. When we said there was no way to use it because it was a health problem with the doors closed, we were told that it is going to be remodeled in A COUPLE OF YEARS and that maybe by the time we came back it would be better. Terrible. For a $300.00 per night hotel, the experience in general could use some upgrading, but overall, not bad.", "Date": "July 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, West Oz", "Title": "\u201cStunning views, but resting on its laurels?\u201d", "Author": "majelperth", "ReviewID": "UR69016936", "Content": "The Fairmont Waterfront hotel in Vancouver has been around since the early 1990s and has one signal advantage over many other hostelries in the city: it is (nearly) smack bang on the waterfront, with stunning views (for most patrons) over the harbour to North Vancouver or east to Burnaby. This view is especially good from one of the expensive corner rooms (the best are the signature room in which I stayed on this trip); but they are probably quite good from the others too. Because it has a great view, and because it is right opposite the Canada Place Cruiseship Terminal, it is a hotel commonly used by passengers after or before a cruise. In our case, it was a post-cruise, single-night stay to stretch out the holiday one day longer. This situation - the view and the cruise-line association - presents the challenge of the Fairmont Hotel: yes, it is a very good and the view is great, but, it feels like a hotel that knows how good its view is, knows that passengers will stay there a lot as part of pre-arranged package deals with cruise ships, and has just lost that special something needed for the hotel to really earn top marks on consistent service and real 'welcoming'. Here is a really good example: There is a $4.50 tray charge on room service - OK we have just about accepted this as regular hotel travellers - but there is a required 17% gratuity. Sorry, but this is not a gratuity: it is 17% on top of theprice. Either let guests tip the wait staff, or put the price up. The breakfast menu for in-room dining is confusing and expensive - one cannot have cereal as part of the continental breakfast - one has to have it separately, for another $6.00. Toast costs $3.00 (and so on). And there is a tray charge for breakfast - even though, usually, this is not the case. Yet, when the breakfast arrives, it is lovely, elegant, beatifully presented and the 17% gratuity would be fine, since the server was really good. Therefore, the hotel's problem is that it wants to be 'great' but has to keep reminding guests, in little ways, the 'great' costs a bit more. Personally, i'd pay another $5 pp for a breakfast without the niggles and wouldn't even notice. (But, they forgot to deliver the newspaper!) As another example: we arrived to discover only 1 robe was in the room; as if by magic, another one appeared from housekeeping without us even asking - great! But, then someone attempted to clean our room at 10 am on the day of checkout (which was 12 noon) and, 5 minutes later, her colleague barged in looking for her. While the concierge, bellhops, and 1 of 2 front desk people were super friendly, the turndown housekeeper was peculiar - which leads me to another point. There is a little card in the hotel room saying that housekeeping is only available from 8 to 4, but if one needs a refresh or turndown, then please contact reception. Since we were there for one night we decided not to have turndown service (since we were just relaxing in our room): yet the person came knocking wanting to do it?! Ultimately, the Fairmont *IS* a great hotel: luxurious and well appointed, nice touches, great location. It is doing a very good job of being a 5-star, opulent hotel - BUT for whatever reason - perhaps its business model, perhaps the issues relating to cruise line packages? - it undercuts the opulence with a rather picky feel to it - like the little signs, the extra charges, the overall sense that, at times, you just need to wait in line until the hotel gets to you. Perhaps, too the Fairmont struggles to be price-competitive and thus tries to maximise inhouse revenue for lower-cost rooms? Only because there are better hotels in Vancouver - the Delta for example - and the Pan Pacific is more convenient from the Cruiselines, I would not recommend the Fairmont - a tough call and one I hope it can fix, since it has great promise as a very good 5-star hotel. Just needs to start acting like one :).", "Date": "June 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton", "Title": "\u201cGreat experience\u201d", "Author": "Imbatman", "ReviewID": "UR68743981", "Content": "I had the honor and priviledge of staying at the Fairmont Waterfront last week for 4 nights and really appreciated the extra steps the guests took to ensure a great experience.

I was pleasantly surprised that the photo of the room on their website actually matched what I found. In addition, there's a huge window in the bathroom with just as great a view as the main room. Just a warning for light sleepers... you will hear the seaplanes taking off starting around 7:00 a.m. but that comes with the territory with staying in any hotel in Coal Harbour. On my first trip I had a room with a city view. The room was nice and spacious, and everything you'd expect from a high quality hotel like the Fairmont. On my 2nd trip I had a partial city and partial water view. Both experiences were great. But if you're in a position to pay a little extra for the corner rooms when you get a deal, it's well worth it! In addition, the service was impeccable and all the staff were very pleasant. They pay attention to the little things like making up the room at the most convenient time or setting up the table for room service breakfast comfortably at the window so that I could enjoy the view (far cry from some other hotels when they plonk down a tray balancing awkwardly off the desk or side table). Finally, the location is unbeatable... across the street from Waterfront Station so you can easily get to and from the Vancouver airport by skytrain, short walk to Robson Street (shopping) and Stanley Park, 5 mins away from the seabus to North Vancouver. You can get to all the important places by walking or by using the skytrain. The one small downside...

We were so comfy getting rugged up every night in the flufffy quilt and gazing out the window to the beautiful city lights.

Food in the local area: We loved the japanese place that the concierge actually drove us to in Gastown, it was upstairs and cheap with loads of food and wine... great Christmas Eve! Our all time favourite was Steamworks in Gastown. Great food, generous serves and great home brew! They also sell coopers pale ale in the bottle shop next door! Other than that we ate out at a \"fancy\" place suggested to us by a younger hip concierge, and though we got smashed on vino, cocktails and shots, we spend around CAD$260 and didn't really rate it too highly over other places. We also ate at Grouse Mountain in the pub, which was extremely yummy, with the best views of Vancouver, and other than that stuck to basic food. Vancouver seemed a little bit of a sleepy town, not somewhere you'd go looking for \"nightlife\" and a night out dancing till dawn. It's cosy, safe, and great value for money with great service. Hotel in general: they were lovely enough to give us high speed internet access for free in the business centre every time we wanted it. I think this was becuase their normal service was down.

The bathroom was vintage with porcelin tiles and sink and what looked like original faucet fixtures which was charming but the low tub with no character just didn't impress along with the skimpy sq footage in the bathroom also. We didn't have enough drawers or closet for all of us to unpack properly so it was definately cramped but once out of the room the hotel offered lots of free roaming and wandering with no boundaries except the gold floor which needed a card to access. The pool was less than I'd expected after the grand entrance and priority treatment you receive during check-in but it was lovely to have the terrycloth bathrobes to return to our room in instead of traipsing waterlogged in a towel too small to dry you off or being forced to change in a sterile locker room. Overall the stay was lovely but when you're staying in a city and exploring the area the amount of time in the room is usually minimal. For our family we have 'been there. done that' - and won't return to the Fairmont Vancouver largely because of the tiny rooms and high prices they charge simply because they can............fyi their sister hotel in Victoria, B.C 'The Empress Fairmont' is equally gorgeous and we stayed there for a low rate of 89.00 in the spring compared to the 169.00 we paid per night in Vancouver - larger room in Victoria but again disappointing room (dust galore) and property itself had visible cobwebs and dust in the main walk-through areas which I thought was unacceptable but for that price I wasn't complaining.", "Date": "December 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cNo Hot Water...Little Sympathy but otherwise Okay...\u201d", "Author": "marac", "ReviewID": "UR50500070", "Content": "Hard to be forgiving when there is no hot water in your room not one day but TWO days.

The chef can even prepare you a specific omelette if it\u2019s not available in the buffet. The fitness center is not very large but the equipments are new. The pool is located on the roof of the hotel on the 3rd floor. The pool is not very large but at least it\u2019s heated and the views of the Ocean are excellent. HOTEL ROOM: I stayed in a port side deluxe view room. The view from the room was spectacular because I was able to see the cruise ship arriving in port. The room was very large and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was nice with big, fluffy towels. The TV was not flat screen so that was a little disappointing for a hotel of this class. Overall, the room was really nice with great beds and great views from the floor to ceiling window. SERVICE: The staffs of the Fairmont Waterfront were really nice and professional. The front desk employees were friendly and efficient. The service in the Herons restaurant was attentive and courteous. Overall, all staffs were friendly and professional and really give the guests the 5 star experience that Fairmont hotels are known for. OVERALL RATING: I give the Fairmont Waterfront 5* out of 5* for its great amenities, large clean rooms and attentive service.", "Date": "August 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary", "Title": "\u201cA pleasure\u201d", "Author": "Canukgal", "ReviewID": "UR37270779", "Content": "Absolutely loved everything about this hotel---quiet, comfortable, beautiful beds and pillows, great food and service.

The room was a good size, modern furnishings, kept very clean and was very quiet and peaceful. The hotel pool (outdoors) on the 3rd floor is fantastic - there is a view of the harbour/mountains and also a small bar providing drink service. There is also an indoor hottub beside the pool. We used room service once and the food was great. We did not use the restaurant in the hotel. There is a shopping center connected to the hotel with a food court and a really nice diner called Ricky's that we ate breakfast at. Much cheaper than the hotel restaurant for breakfast. For those looking to sight see in Vancouver I highly recommend the Vancouver smart card. It gets you into the major tourist attractions and is quite a $$ savings over paying for each attraction separately. We booked through Expedia and they provided excellent service. The hotel is in an excellent location right on the harbour within walking distance to many attractions including Stanley Park.

However, the hotel needs a real makeover (once the new Fairmont opens a few blocks away, it doesnt stand a chance). It seems some of the 'top' hotels in Vancouver think that if they erect a modern looking entrance to the hotel, guests wont notice the rest of the hotel hasn't changed since the 80's. The communal areas are nice enough but the corridors and rooms (I went in 2 different ones) are so old fashioned. The curtains and drapes in our room were threadbare in part. The windows needed a good clean, inside and out. The bathrooms certainly hadnt been changed for years and years and were small by comparison to other hotels we stayed in BC.

A shiney modern hotel with all the best and latest facilties, spotlessly clean and run to the very highest standards. My wife & I rarely return to hotels as they never seem the same or as good as you remember, but this one is outstanding, we have been to this hotel 3 times now and plan to return again, it\u2019s so difficult to find fault with, everythng is well managed, from efficient check and check out to the notes left in the room from the maid as well as personnaly addressed weather forecasts. The staff are all the friendliest in the business and can\u2019t do enough for you. Fairmont Presidents Club; well worth enrolling in this free loyalty club as you get immediate benefits such as free broadband in the room, morning newspaper, preferential room rates, upgrades and discount vouchers for hotel dining and spa. Location; set in a prime location and as the name implies it is set on the waterfront directly opposite the Canada Place Convention Centre, Pan Pacific Hotel & Pier where cruise ships birth. There is a fantastic view from waterfront facing rooms, you can watch float planes taking off & landing, cruise ships arriving and leaving and all kinds of watercraft buzzing about, never a dull moment. Convenient for those on business and perfect for tourists, being near the main shopping areas, will be well used for the 2010 Winter Olympics as it is close to the brand new grass roofed Convention Centre which will serve as the Olympics Media Centre. Fairmont is building another hotel directly opposite the media centre, so there may be some spare capacity after the Olympics are over and prices may drop. Convenience; all of the major tour coaches and operators pick up and drop off at this hotel using the hotel layby. There is also a small shopping mall and food court under the hotel as well as a Translink rail station. Rooms; standard rooms are of good quality and reasonable size, cheapest have city view and if you aren\u2019t bothered about the view then these are perfectly acceptable and represent good value. Next up are the Harbour and Waterfront View rooms which are basicaly the same as the City View rooms but have superb views of the harbour, some rooms have floor to ceiling glazing. Next up are the suites, we had a waterfront facing suite for one stay which had separate lounge & bedroom, TV & CD player in both areas and the loan of some CDs. The same high quality toiletries are used throughout the hotel regardless of room type. Restaurant; we used Herons Restaurant for breakfast & evening meals which serves the second best buffet breakfast we have ever had anywhere (the Fairmont in Banff will take some beating and needs to be seen to be believed). You will be addressed by name at Herons. As with all good quality hotel restaurants they cook eggs to your individual requirements and make a superb eggs benedict. In fact they say if there is anything you want but can\u2019t see it, they will get it for you. It should be noted that you can dine in the evening at Herons and choose from the a la carte or bar menu, so you can enjoy the ambience on a budget, but prices are very reasonable and it should go without saying that the food is fantastic, using fresh herbs from the hotel roof garden, they really have superb chefs and the freshest ingredients. The room service menu is the same as the bar menu, but with a 12% gratuity and $4.50 delivery charge added, plus GST. Pool & fitness suite; one of the rare hotels in Vancouver to have a swimming pool, set on level 3, the same level as the roof gardens where herbs are grown for the restaurant, flowers for decorations and bee hives for honey used in cooking. Nice outside heated pool, reasonable size, nice temperature and surrounded by a terrace with comfortable sun loungers, tables & chairs, towels obtained from the fitness suite you pass through to get to the pool area, could do with some parasols as the weather was unseasonably hot while we were there and there was no shade. The fitness suite has plenty of modern equipment as well as a Jacuzzi pool.

Having had plenty of notice of an upcoming business stay at the hotel I managed to reserve one of the lower rates in the standard Fairmont rooms which are well appointed though usually on lower floors and with less of a view than the upgraded room categories. For business though they're more than alright and so I was very pleasantly surprised to have been given an unsolicited upgrade to a corner room which features both city skyline as well as harbour views from both the bedroom and the bathroom. It seems rooms ending in either 16 or 24 are corner units in the hotel, which is a triangluar shape, and I was in 1524, a Signature room category I believe it is called. The photo's I've included do not do the room justice but the most interesting feature was the floor-to-ceiling wildows in the bathroom that allowed you to soak up the Stanley Park, Vancouver harbour and city skyline vistas while soaking in the large and deep tub. A great way to wash off the jet lag and prepare for meetings next morning. The hotel is location across the street from Canada Place, which is home to the Vancouver Convention Centre, The Pan Pacific Hotel and Cruise Ship Terminal so a busy corner when two huge cruise ships are disembarking 5,000+ passengers and embarking as many in the same day. Somehow it works and the staff do their best to handle the ebb & flow on these cruise ship sail days but you can't help notice how crowded the lobby is with luggage and how hectic the front desk really is. That having been said however I was quietly amazed at how well the staff took the pace in stride and seemed to deliver a consistently professional and courteous level of customer service. I left my luggage after checkin out at the Bell Desk for a few hours while I did a bit of Gastown sightseeing and the staff there was efficient and pleasant as well. A walk in the opposite direction would get you to the famous Stanley Park, which is a big draw for it's walking, cycling and jogging paths with stunning mountain and harbour views. Note that the airporter shuttle service in from Vancouver International Airport alternates service between the Fairmont Waterfront and the Pan Pacific across the street, stopping at one hotel one hour and the other the next however as they're literally facing each other even having to negotiate the short walk isn't too much of a downside. By the way, I found the airport shuttle very inexpensive at CAD$22 roundtrip. We had a working buffet breakfast at Heron's and enjoyed the spacious almost outdoor patio setting of the restaurant. Those guests opting to upgrade to a Fairmont Gold level room receive as part of the extra ammenities a private breakfast area that is much quieter than Heron's but like most hotels when you pay more you get more and such is the case here as well. Unlike many other Fairmont's the Waterfront isn't a restored heritage hotel and is modern in both decor and ammenities. Conference rooms and business services are also state of the art, though didn't have enough time to try the fitness facilities out during my short stay. A heated outdoor pool set on a terrace a few stories above street level offers a nice oasis in the downtown for some relaxation even in cooler months. It is worth it to sign up for the free Fairmont loyalty program called Fairmont President's Club as one perk is free internet access even for basic members. The other nice perk I find is that there is the regular check-in desk as well as one dedicated for President's Club members and it's usually much quicker.

The window itself was floor-to-ceiling and spanned the entire length of the room, we never closed the curtains and routinely watched cruise ships come into dock at 6am just as the sun rose above the mountains. The marble bathroom was pleasant, although the bath functions as a shower and you are not able to run and fill up the bath as no plug is supplied. Unlike other reviews we never heard noise from neighboring rooms, nor did we experience light from the corridor shining under the door at night. Moreover, the housekeeping was superb, supplying fresh bed clothes and bathroom towels daily. Overall the room was excellent, the only downside being the television was rather small and old (not a flatscreen as pictured on the website) and the mini bar was extrememly expensive. The concierge service was very friendly and welcoming as you may expect. I would suggest phoning ahead (before you arrive in Vancouver) and asking the concierge to book your day trips, we did this and everything was organised for us upon arrival. The Herons Lounge was superb, however you can certainly find cheaper and equally as good restaurants nearby, for example Gastown (a short 5 minute walk) has an excellent Italian. Lastly, the location of the hotel is second-to-none. Canada Place is right on the water front and access to the seawall, it is also close to the wealthy financial district. I would suggest you stay on a higher floor if you want a good view however as recent construction nearby may impede rooms on lower floors. This may be why Fairmont is building its new \"Pacific Rim\" hotel only a 2 minute walk from this hotel! If I were to go back I would probably stay at the Pan Pacific as I believe it may offer slightly better unobstructed views.", "Date": "October 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cLoved the \"Dog\" who greets you out front.\u201d", "Author": "BlueBear77", "ReviewID": "UR20791105", "Content": "My stay at the Fairmont Waterfront Hotel in Vancouver, Canada was one of the best I have ever had.

I watched the cruise ships sail. The hotel location was so convenient to everthing. My king size bed was just firm enough and so comfortable I slept like a baby. I am tall and the big tub was wonderful to soak in after a long day flying, etc. I just loved my room on the 12th floor. I traveled alone so safety was a concern. I felt very safe at the hotel.

The staff in Heron's were particularily friendly (yes I know they want tips but if the staff are upbeat and appear interested in your day it starts the day well) The breakfast was excellent and all of good quality.

The carpets in the halls are dated, and our room I think was in need of a bit of TLC. The shower in the bathroom (which was absolutely huge - enough to have a small party in!) sprayed water all over the ceiling as well as the floor every time we used it. The furniture in the bedroom was a little tired as well and there was a stain all over the armchair. For a rather expensive room, I wouldn't necessarily expect this. Also, internet access was $14.95, which I resent paying, having had free wi-fi in all of the other hotels we have stayed in recently. I think a room on a higher floor would be best for views, as although our room had huge floor to ceiling windows, a new conference centre has been built (there is lots of construction work around the hotel, however this did not disturb us at all, unlike the rather friendly couple in the room next door on our last night - soundproofing between rooms could be better!) and this blocks the views for anyone below about level 10 I would think.

When we arrived around noon on Saturday, our room was not ready yet. We had requested a King size bed but it was not available. Instead of their standard room with 2 double beds on a lower floor, we were changed to a room with a Queen bed on the 15th floor with a harbor view which would be ready later that afternoon. The view of the harbor was great! The bed was a Queen size, but it was a pull down which didn't bother either of us. The room was a decent size and comfortable. The morning of check out, the fire alarm went off and they had a rough time getting the elevators to work. The staff was very nice and if was obvious they felt bad about it.

I had already gotten an amazing rate, but they very kindly reduced it because they blocked me into a Murphy suite (room 1002) - one normally used as a sitting room of a parlour suite, with a bed that folds down from a wall unit. No doubt many travellers would be terribly disappointed at not getting \"a proper room\" but I liked it very much. The sitting area was very large and comfortable, a long angled passage gave excellent insulation from sound in the hallway, the bed was perfectly comfortable. I liked the built-in aspect of it - it had very good recessed lighting over the pillows, and I do like pleasant lighting. I didn't really have the need to ask the staff for much, but everyone I dealt with was very pleasant and perfectly courteous. Every detail of housekeeping was impeccable, the bathroom was enormous (far more than I needed, really, but other travellers will appreciate this detail), and the amenities top quality. Thanks to my Fairmont President's Club membership I enjoyed complimentary internet access; it's worth signing up for this program before you go for this benefit alone. Once I figured out how to connect (one phone call to the desk was all it took) I found the internet service very fast and easy to access. Once again I found Fairmont well exceeded my expectations and I would recommend the Waterfront without hesitation. A heads-up to cruise passengers: the Waterfront, being right across from the Canada Place cruise terminal, does book a very large number of cruise travellers during the season. This results in very high occupancy levels which means it is hardly reasonable to expect rooms to be available when you disembark at 9 or 10 in the morning. (hotel full previous night + people like to sleep in and check out late on vacation and on weekends = few guests checking out early enough to give Housekeeping time to prepare rooms for early arrivals. That check-in time is there for a reason, people...) Also, ascertain before you go that your cruise line does dock at Canada Place, and not at Ballantyne which is a little further east. It's pretty simple: all cruise lines dock at Canada Place except for Celebrity and Royal Caribbean. It's still just a short cab ride to Ballantyne. The YVR Airporter stops right around the corner from the hotel, and sometime in late summer or fall 2009 the Canada Line subway to the airport will be in operation with a stop at Waterfront station right across the street so airport connections can hardly be easier. PS: overnighting at the Waterfront meant I was downtown in time for breakfast at Scoozi's, on Howe St, barely 5 minutes away, which must be the best breakfast anywhere in downtown.", "Date": "September 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cGood quality hotel but not faultless\u201d", "Author": "PeterRUk", "ReviewID": "UR19463554", "Content": "Had 2 x 2 night stays here either side of a cruise.

The views of the ocean and mountains from the room were gorgeous. There is a herb garden open to the public on the third floor which was unique.

This was our first Fairmont (but not our last) and was everything we expected it to be. We booked it because it has an excellent location near to Stanley Park and the main shopping areas and because we wanted a quality hotel. Arrival was smooth; met at the taxi, bags whisked up to our room, check in smooth. The room had an excellent view of the harbour with window the width of the room. Large room with a small sitting area and two chairs, writing desk, tv, coffee making facilities, built in safe box. Very large bathroom, twin sinks, bath and shower excellent. Huge comfortable (which for us means soft) king size bed. We used the gym a couple of times (small but well equipped and mostly underused by guests so no waiting). You are provided with huge fluffy bathrobes, and we used the rooftop pool as we were blessed with good weather, and passed a pleasant hour sunbathing on the deck. This hotel is very clean - maid service excellent, is well equipped and in a good state of repair. The concierge was extremely helpful and knowledgeable, gave us a streetmap and marked directions so we could catch the seabus (up to Grouse Mountain and Capillano). Very friendly people all round. One evening around the lobby and restaurant and bar there were a lot of dressed up folk, and and as we're 'small casual' sort of people this wasn't our scene.The restaurant in the hotel was too much: far too formal (and perhaps pretentious) for us and very expensive so we didn't use it. It did look nice, and we have no reason to think the food wouldn't be good, so if you like that sort of think it may be the place for you. But there are many, many good places to eat just a short walk away. We really like Earl's, which is a sports bar and restaurant: informal, nice food, great service and good value. We did use the bar for early morning coffee, and once for late night drinks. They have a pianist in the evenings and that makes for a nice experience. They serve food in the bar but it's a poor choice (pizza or burger) and over-priced. This is a chain hotel; so if you are looking for a family run, cosy hotel this isn't it.

The only meal we ate in the hotel was in Herons restaurant in the lobby on New Year\u2019s Day, and even though it was very quiet there was still a full menu and the food was excellent. We also found ourselves stopping here for a nightcap on more than one occasion as it was very relaxing! The Concierge was extremely helpful, booking return seaplane flights to Victoria for us at 1 hour\u2019s notice. We had been drawn in having watched them landing and taking off! The bell service was also excellent and on two occasions they drove us to restaurants in one of the hotel\u2019s cars. Furthermore, they lent us umbrellas when it was raining.

I typically stay at Hiltons and Marriotts Why: Business Location: The Fairmont is located on the waterfront. It\u2019s within throwing distance of the \u2018gastown\u2019 area, which contains some great restaurants, interesting shops, regular shopping, and the famous \u2018steam clock\u2019. The view from the water-facing side of the hotel is very nice, especially if you enjoy watching sea planes take off and land. This Fairmont is connected to a below-street-level mini mall, which adds another level of convenience. It\u2019s about a 20 minute walk along the waterfront, to the famous Stanley Park. Check-in: The check in process was extremely quick, courteous, and professional. Layout: The lobby and restaurant area are all conveniently located on the first floor, and it\u2019s not at all difficult to navigate to the rooms from the elevator. Rooms: The rooms are spacious and very clean. The bed was very comfortable, but the pillows were just so-so. The linens were exceptionally clean, however. The water pressure in the shower was a little anemic, but there was plenty of hot water, and the consistency of the water temp was good. I did notice that the water was \u201csoft\u201d, in that you have to wash twice as long to get the soapy, \u2018slippery\u2019 feel off your skin. I\u2019d imagine that\u2019s the same anywhere you\u2019d stay in that area, however. The room had an iron / ironing board, and fridge / minibar. Besides the view, my favorite part of the room was the wide-screen HDTV. Very nice. Service: The housekeeping service was just fine. I haven\u2019t had many experiences with Fairmont hotels, but one of the things that seems to be consistent among them, is the presence of many doormen, pursers, concierge personnel, and others who are happy to give you whatever help you need. For elderly travelers, or for those with special needs, this would be enough for me to pay a little more for the Fairmont level of service. Restaurants: There is a restaurant on site which serves 3 meals a day, but I didn\u2019t eat any of them there. Internet: There is a fee to use the internet, but I never had trouble connecting or staying connected. The speed was just fine for everything I needed to do. Gift Shop: There isn\u2019t one...you have to go downstairs to the attached mini-mall, or down the street to the shopping district. Summary: The Vancouver Waterfront Fairmont is an extremely nice place to stay. My satisfaction, however, is largely based on the fact that someone else paid the bills, and the fact that we were able to get a discount thru a local university, which resulted in paying about half of the original $400+ nightly rate.

Immediately we arrived someone took our luggage and made it clear that it would be delivered as soon as we had checked in - and it was. The receptionists were helpful, the waitresses at breakfast superb and the general ambiance between staff and residents seemed excellent. We had a bed and breakfast package so i cannot quote the price of the breakfast but the food was very good. The warm food was actually warm - and that's a tester for hotels these days! Our bedroom had a very good view across Canada Place (from where the cruise liners leave); it was spacious (certainly by British standards) and quite well appointed with a mini bar and most of the other common hotel accoutrements. But there was no room safe which was disappointing for there should be in a hotel of this standard. For an ordinary tourist the location of the hotel is superb - just across the road from the cruise liner terminal (excellent place to stay if you are going on a boat), about 3 or 4 minutes from the sea bus terminal and the Sky Train terminal and maybe about 5 or 6 minutes from Gastown. For those who really need to go shopping the main shopping areas are only about a 10 minute walk away. The sea planes are not far away either. My main criticism is the bar which is basically an adjunct to the restaurant. When it is busy it can be reasonably pleasant ( though expensive) for people watching but when it is quiet (e.g. late in the evening) it can appear quite uninviting. There is a British style pub a couple of minutes away - left on leaving the hotel, next left and it is across the road. The beer was very good, the ambiance pleasant and they do wonderful steaks on Saturdays. I think it is called \"The Lions\" As for the construction work which has been covered in earlier reviews I don't totally understand the problem unless it has all changed. Yes, there is construction going on but it is not very immediate to the hotel, there was not a lot of noise and I scarcely noticed it.

We booked in advance via the internet and got a prepaid rate of $309 (CAD) per night for a cityview room on the Gold Level. My husband achieved President's Club Premier status with this stay, which may be why we received an upgraded room with a harborview. Gold level guests have a separate check in on the 9th floor, just outside the lounge. Everyone working the concierge desk was pleasant and helpful. Our room had a king sized bed, comfortable reading chair, desk, armoire with tv, bar, a rather smallish but adequate bath, and a large picture window overlooking the harbor (side where ferry boats dock). It also had a clock/cd player and several cds were provided. It's definately worthwhile to stay on the Gold level, due to all the perks given. There is a very extensive free continental breakfast served every morning, with cereals, cheeses, meats, fruit, pastries, breads and a hot entree, as well as juices, milk, tea and coffee. This alone would cost you $17.00 per person from room service. Coffee, tea, water, soft drinks and cookies are available during the day, and in the evening, a nice selection of hors d'oeuvres are served. There is also an honor bar, which many guests took advantage of (ie didn't pay). I checked out the fitness room which has a great view, but the equipment is pretty old. There is a small outdoor pool, not big enough for lap swimming. On our first night the hotel fire alarm went off about 6:30 pm and continued off and on for about 45 minutes. A recorded message played periodically saying that they were investigating the alarm. Finally we got an all clear, false alarm. Speaking of noise, previous reviewers have noted the construction noise in the area. There is an extension being built to the Convention Center across the street and it's true that the pile drivers start early in the morning and go on into the evening, sometimes 3-4 at a time. This makes quite a racket which you can clearly hear in your room. This would be very annoying if you had to spend a lot of time in your room. If this would be a problem, you might want to consider staying in a hotel away from the waterfront for the next few years.

But if you booked, asked for a waterfront 'deluxe' room view then you are in for a surprise. The photos in the previous review show the sideways 'portside' view from some of the hotel rooms. It's not the primary 'waterfront' view from the hotel. The photos of the pool point to the other sideways outlook and if a slightly wider angle were used you would have another ugly vista of the construction site. Second issue is noise. The construction work is pile-driving. A repetitive bang with an echo off the surrounding tall buildings. It starts at 0730. Fine if you don't plan to sleep late - but leave you to imagine what a quiet dip in the outdoor pool or breakfast on the verandah can be like when this is ocurring. This isn't the hotel's fault.

This was a last minute check-in and we wanted a suite to face the water so the clerk found a suite very fast. The room was fantastic, nice linens, robes, and even a phone next to the toilet, which I chuckled about.
