A few observations:1) This hotel isn't very convenient for those who don't speak Chinese. Front desk staff speaks very basic English, this can get difficult if you have questions about booking tours and issues beyond check-in and check-out.2) Location is central (two blocks to East Gate of Forbidden City) and within walking distance to the Wangfujing Metro stop. But now that the Beijing Metro is in place, really anywhere near any Metro stop will be convenient. 3) Breakfast buffet is 25Y/person. Don't do it. Just go down west on Dong'anmen St. for small diners that will serve you better food for much cheaper.4) The rooms themselves (we had a deluxe double) are not quite 3-star. The beds are hard, the carpet is stained, and the bathroom is of the shower is the entire bathroom kind (as in no tub and no separate shower). Bring shower shoes (flip flops) if you plan to stay here. Hotel operates on a budget as they will only give you rolls of toilet paper that's about a quarter size of regular toilet paper rolls.Walls are paper thin. Wasn't an issue at first but on our last night, we had some little kids stay next door and we could hear every scream, whine, and moan.5) The Night Market in front of the hotel is very tourist-oriented (like everything else in the Wangfujing area). It's more of a freak show (food ranges from starfish to scorpions to seahorses on sticks) than a true reflection of Chinese street food. Food is also very expensive, BBQ lamb kabob was 5 times the price of the same thing at another street vendor outside the Wanfujing area. The upside is that most of these street vendors speak enough English to make a sale and the facilities appear more sanitary than your average street food joint. In short, if you get a really good price on this hotel and don't mind the budget hotel category, then it's a decent choice. Otherwise, there are probably better hotels to spend your evenings.", "Date": "May 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR809353252", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "donnaaries"}, {"Content": "Great location, 14\u9227?per night per person, BUT tiny and old       Beihai Park", "Date": "Mar 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR278260061", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "AustrianTraveller23"}, {"Content": "Not worth your money or time I would highly not recommend staying at this hotel. While it's location is prime, it's simply not worth the hassle. From the get-go, our stay was doomed. The front desk staff were rude, had no record of my friend's booking (yet they did mine and we both had printouts). When we approached the tour desk/business centre and asked if we could use the internet, they flat out told us no, without giving a reason. The rooms were old, decrepid, and stank like smoke and mildew. We felt ill the whole week. My room had no windows, so I was in complete darkness all day and night. The carpets were stained and there was a general uncleanliness about it. I could have overlooked the hotel's appearance if it weren't for the incredibly rude staff. It's too bad --- if they renovated and retrained their staff, it would be a great find, especially with the upcoming Olympic Games.", "Date": "Oct 8, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR170495849", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "TeeBeis"}, {"Content": "Please do not book this hotel! Negatives:1. The room stinked smoke. 2. I had booked a Deluxe room but it was not so great compared to a standard room in an ordinary hotel 3. Extra bed provided was broken and had to be replaced 4. The replaced one was bad too and they had to keep some towels 5. I complained this to the manager (Mr. Meng) next day to bring to his notice. He said its already over now, nothing can be done. When I asked him is this how you reply to a customer he was rude in his tone. I told him I would write this in the hotel review and he didnt care. He hung up on me!!!!!6. I would not go back to this hotel again. 7. On eLong this hotel is advertised as 4 star!! But its a 3-star and the quality of service isnt that great! Positives:The good thing about this hotel is only the location.", "Date": "Oct 18, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR451113088", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "prvnk"}, {"Content": "Pretty Basic Stayed 5 nights here in September 2006. It is a fairly basic hotel (The word luxury definately does not apply) I stayed in the standard room the first night as my deluxe room was not available. The standard room was somewhat pokey with no seperate shower cubicle (you showered in front on the sink and Toilet). It was also quite noisy as corridor traffic could be heard quite easily.The deluxe room was somewhat bigger and had a seperate shower cubicle. Both rooms were serviced with clean linen however the carpets were quite stained and the wooden doors needed revarnishing. Still the deluxe room was certainly worth the extra 100 Yuan/nightAs a place to crash it was ok but not a place to spend a lot of time in so don't expect anything flash. Both rooms were airconditioned. The breakfast is also basic with a limited range of warm (as opposed to hot) dishes.Like everything in China, you can bargain on the price even in the hotels so if you are able to get through the language barrier, you can probably get a much better deal either here or at a variety of other hotels.Position wise its pretty good, the Night markets are directly outside with a huge variety of exotic dishes although noting that the raw meat was not refrigerated for many hours meant we excercised discretion and ate at the larger restaurants. There is a basic but very cheap and tasty dumpling cafe about 100 metres up the road as well as a variety of other restaurants. Its very close to the main shopping mall and within walking distance to the Forbidden City and Tianamen Square.", "Date": "Oct 1, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR139554032", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Eames"}, {"Content": "Great deal, given location       A sample of the night market just outside", "Date": "Feb 6, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR479973274", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "orangeman"}, {"Content": "Stay away at all costs I stayed 4 nights here as part of a tour group. This place was an absolute disaster outside of the lobby area. We were given a room on the 1st floor, and there is no sound insulation. The wallpaper was dirty, the carpets looked like they had never been cleaned. There was a mildewy odour in the room, and noticed some water damage on the walls. At the end of November, when the temperature was close to freezing outside, I did not use the covers in my 6.5 x 3 feet bed because the temperature in the room was 26C. If the beds weren't that size, you wouldn't be able to fit anything else in the room.The only redeeming quality of this hotel was the location. Every night outside the hotel, there is a block long outdoor food fair that can be described as a Taste of Beijing. You are also close to a shopping area that was made up of western brand stores like Nike, Esprit, and RBK.", "Date": "Dec 2, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR180281173", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "blkjck5697"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d665029-r22570442-Wan_Cheng_Hua_Fu_International_Hotel-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "665029", "Price": "$65"}}
