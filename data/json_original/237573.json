This made me wake up any time during night or early morning. Only for this reason i would not stay in this hotel for next time.Because of lack of sleep on last day i got so tired and sick.

I do want to mention an outstanding customer service we have received from Hub, who went above and beyond in his efforts to help us. He was great with all the customers of the hotel, and it was not only because it is his job but because he is a great person and enjoys being around and helping people. Over the course of years we have stayed in many hotels including 5 star ones, and I can honestly say that Hub has singlehandedly blew them all out of the water.

Firstly its location was to me one of the best in Amsterdam, directly on Dam Sq and walking distance from Central Station...There is a Tram stop directly opposite just behind The Palace..Needless to say I did not use the trams but they are are great way to explore the city. The RHO Hotel produces great maps with the tram numbers and stops showing, which is extremely useful, if ask the friendly reception staff, Christian or Natasha, they will be glad to help you in any way they can. Our checkin time for the room was 3pm...so we arrived early around 1100, unfortunately it was not possible for us to get early checkin as the hotel was fully booked the night before..but, after speaking to reception it was explained to me that, had it not been fully booked, early checkin could have been arranged..However, we were given the key to the lockup, in here we could store our bags until check in. As we were waiting we just popped around the corner for a relaxing beer, e2.50 (which is not bad at all) immediately there you could sit and soak up the nice atmosthphere!! We arrived back for check-in which was straight forward, as there was a group on 9 of us on a Hen Party, I had emailed the hotel previously to see if there were any surprise extras we could add...upon check-in we were told that we could try out the apartments which were larger, they had a kichenette with fridge, an outside smoking area...a very nice airy bathroom, livingroom and 2 bedrooms...this was excellent for our trip as we all met up here in the evenings...You can also buy drinks locally in the supermarket and keep them cool in the fridge..again these supermarkets are accessible to the hotel... We also had a triple room which was spacous, extreamely clean, and had a nice, airy spotless bathroom. The rooms were cleaned well. Cleaniness continued throughout the hotel.(spotless even though there are carpets) The hotel reception had a warm welcoming feel, nice to sit and relax in. Breakfast...was simple but good...Scrambled or boiled eggs, toast, bacon type, great tea coffee facilities...Cheese fruit...Ymmm pastries...Jam Museli yogurt...all very nice for a good start to the day...Breakfast started a 7 until 10...but I seen a few after 10..Best not be late for breakkie though!!! There are coffee and drink machines in hotel,,,Fizzy drinks and beer,,,Heineken of course which is a great beer and I have been totally converted, oh yes, and also its the cheapest as it local. EXCURSION...Hmmm, I didn't do any, but had planned to do Heineken factory from there you get a complimentry canal cruise taken you through the skinny bridge...girlies may enjoy Purses &Hand Bags Museum....numerous more.....all can be looked at in reception, there are flyers immediately as you go throught the door...***But to be honest with you...I have learned you never know how the days and nights will unfold in Amsterdam so preplanning your trip is not necessary...!!! NightTime.... We had prebooked a Dinner/Club ticket on escape.nl...e40 which was great, it included nice 3 course meal and VIP entrance into the night club, which was very modern clean...excellent place if you want a club..However you must book that on teh website...We were very glad we prebooked this. It was a great start to the trip. Red light District...We had a walk around, however there are dangerours parts so be very careful...also buying drinks can be expensive... Sooo, all in all my 2 day trip to Amsterdam was wonderful, I will be hopefully be returning in June to see a little more of the cultural city and I will defo be saying in the RHO Hotel..

Again, a common comment is that the breakfast is very good, and yes it is. on the face of it it looks nothing special and it has all the usual suspects it just seems the quality of the produce is very good. if i did have a complaint it would only be that the room seemed to get very hot at night, but we were on the top floor, however this was soon remidied by turning off our rooms heating at night. Overall, if your going to amsterdam to see the sights you could do a lot worse than stay here, and when we next return to Amsterdam, we will certainly be staying at the Rho.", "Date": "February 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cquite good choice near everything in amsterdam\u201d", "Author": "driber9", "ReviewID": "UR124104377", "Content": "i stayed here with my family, in fact i'm writing this from the same hotel, it's a very good choice if you don't wat something expensive, but don't wanna stay back in being comfortable and well located in such a beautiful city as amsterdam is. very big rooms, clean, big lobby, and exceptional breakfast", "Date": "February 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kortrijk, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyable hotel\u201d", "Author": "BDeMaert", "ReviewID": "UR124051802", "Content": "The hotel itself: Located next to the Dam Square and a short walk from the train station.

If you are traveling with lots of luggage, a small child in a stroller or someone in a wheelchair you'd better opt for a room close to the elevators. The rooms itself are more than adequate, with a decent sized bathrooms with all needed amenities. Wifi internet is free of charge, but you need to ask an access code at reception, speed is decent; however note that it can slow down quite a bit (I stayed there while there was a trade show happening in Amsterdam, and once all the business people got into their rooms the speed dropped significantly). However it's free so there's no reason to complain about it really. Depending on the room you have you could have slight noises of the street seeping into the room.

It's not like this in the Rho. A large lobby with a lift, and proper wide staircases make getting around easy.

I was also influenced by the attractive room rate although I was slightly dubious about the hotel location as (knowing Amsterdam reasonably well) it was only a few metres from Dam Square and fairly close to the bars and fast food outlets of Damstraat (there are also a few bars down Nes). Check-in was very easy even though we arrived mid-morning and the reception staff were great (in fact the reception staff were great throughout our stay). The hotel is a converted theatre so the layout is a bit 'different' to a purpose-build hotel. Access to our room on the ground floor was via the entrance to the hotel car park which is internal to the building. Our room was large with 3 single beds and a good-sized bathroom and was very clean. There was no view to speak of from the windows as the room faced onto an alleyway and the lower windows had patterned glass (for privacy I guess). The room was equiped with a television and a fridge. There was a safe but it didn't seem to be working. There was a fairly limited range of channels to choose from on the television (13 I think of which a couple were English-speaking news channels) and the picture quality was not great but was good enough to work out what was going on (who goes on holiday to watch television anyway?). The beds were very comfortable and the shower over the bath was perfectly adequate. Breakfast was of the buffet style and you just pitched up, got yourself a table and helped yourself to food and drinks. There was a good selection of hot and cold foods and drinks and I was more than happy with the quality of the breakfast. It could get busy at times but we always managed to find a free table. The only negative point I can raise about my stay at the Rho is the level of outside noise at night from people partying until 4am or even 5am. This is probably not as much of an issue if you don't have a ground floor room or if you're a bit of a party animal and are out until the early hours of the morning but for families this could be a problem. The noise didn't keep my daughter awake but I'm a very light sleeper and I did wake up many times in the early hours of the morning due to people in the streets talking and scooters whizzing around. I would recommend this hotel if you are looking for a comfortable, reasonably priced place to stay in Amsterdam and you want to be in the heart of the action.

RHO is located some 10-15 meters from Dam square, which is a really central in Amsterdam. The lobby is really big area which can serve as a good meeting point for guests. We had 2 rooms there, none of them had views but looking to small patios and other rooms windows. 3rd. floor was signed as a no smoking area, but the smell of smoke in our room was really heavy when we got in, and that smell stayed with us for the rest of our stay. The gentleman from reception told us they can only ask people not to smoke and there is no rules to avoid them from this action! which was a bit surprising. Rooms were clean, but house keeping was not so organized. Our sheets were old enough and you could see a couple of failures in the bed sheets, but still clean. Rooms bigger than what we expected for a centrally located hotel. safe box in the room was big enough for what ever we had and you don't want to take with you in Amsterdam. Reception staff were extremely helpful, the only surprising point was the different opinions they had about the places one of them recommended to us and others didn't like it :-) Breakfast was good, and the breakfast area was quite big for all of hotel guests. Hotel has a parking which is a paid parking, which you should be expecting that. we didn't use the parking but saw a couple of guests using it and they didn't sound unsatisfied. Reception staff booked a taxi for us to the Schiphol airport with no headache and as they told us before, it was only needed 10 minutes to get the car. If you are number of people or have excess luggage, ask them to get a station for you, which need no extra charges. For the wing in which our rooms were in, there was only one elevator, and during peak hours, we needed to wait some time for the elevator to come. I think the size of elevator was also a bit smaller than what it should be. Apart from tired old sheets, and not so organized housekeeping, we really didn't have much to complain about. One note needed to be noted by families, is that the hotel is also close to the red light area, if you have any thoughts about that (avoiding or liking to be).

The bed, as I said before, was small, but generally comfortable. There was 1 extra pillow (for a total of 3) which were not that comfortable at all.

We booked a triple room, and the room was sufficient for the 3 of us. The bed was comfortable. But there was no AC, just a fan. Since we arrived at night and it was cold, it was not a problem to us. However, the shower didn't work. There were 2 taps, one for hot and one for cold, and the cold one didn't work at all. We found out about this late at night so we didn't bother asking the staff to fix it. In the morning we had to leave early for our flight, so we ended up not taking a shower because of this. For the rate we paid, we expected more of this hotel. We paid for this hotel when we checked-in, which was weird for us, most hotels ask for payments during check-out, but not this one. Anyway, it was not a big problem we just found it weird, like they didn't trust us or something. The staff...well...they were rude, unfriendly, stuck up, and had the air like they were better than us. When we checked-in, I asked my mother to check-in for us and for some reason, the guy at the reception couldn't find our booking. I told him again that we booked under my mother's name, and he finally found our booking and then told my mother that \"You could've told me your name\"...like she was annoying him, how rude. The next day after we checked-out we had to leave soon to catch our flight so we asked the receptionist to call a taxi for us. She did and asked us to stay in the lobby and wait for the taxi. About 15 minutes later my mother went out and saw a taxi near the front door of the hotel and thought it was our taxi. So we immediately got out, brought our luggages, and thanked the receptionist. When we got out, the receptionist caught up to us and asked us not to get to into the taxi because it was not the one she called for. And she very rudely told us \"You can't ask me to call a taxi for you and then you get in another taxi!\" and she stormed off inside. I was baffled and outraged. How were we supposed to know that it was not our taxi?! She didn't explain anything! Anyway, we ended up not getting into the taxi and I went back in to ask her what was the name of the taxi she called for. She didn't tell me the name of the taxi just that usually the taxi driver of the taxi they called for would get into the hotel and let the receptionist know that they've arrived. If we get into a taxi she didn't call for, we could get charged double (which I doubt because we have been in Amsterdam several times and this never happened). And she very rudely said that she didn't care what taxi we got into, that she only did that for us. Well, she could've told us nicely and not rudely like that. I mean she's a receptionist, working in hospitality industry, and should be friendly to their guests at all times! Anyway, around 5 minutes later the correct taxi arrived. Because of this very rude receptionist, I will never ever go back to this hotel despite the great location. The rate isn't great either. Expensive for what we got...broken shower and rude staff.

The RHO is just off Dam square (a few paces and you are there). Since it's central it makes it a good base for visiting all the sights. We walked to Van Gogh museum which is a fair distance, but we both like walking. The cafes on the square are excellent for people watching and we would unwind with a coffee/beer at the end of the day.( Back to the hotel) We received a warm welcome from the desk clerk and we had stipulated an upper floor room which we received. The hotel was very clean and well maintained. No noise was heard from outside, and the only noise inside was the odd guest who seemed unable to close their door without banging it? A minor gripe! The room was average sized and we had a bath and shower.The bathroom has a hairdryer and the room comes with a safe for you personal belongings. A buffet breakfast is served and the food was excellent. Staff kept the buffet well stocked up and used plates were cleared away promptly.

However the sockets by the tv and fridge are independent and there was a spare for our phone chargers etc. There were NO MICE, although, like every house, restaurant and hotel in Amsterdam there was a resident cat.

We were pretty much disappointed with everything after we left as we felt it could have been done better. The location is as good as it can get, right on the Dam square but in a tiny side street so there is very little street noise. However this means that it is very hard to get by car to the front of the hotel, not even the taxi could do it. The reception service was good, we got our keys right away and used the elevator to get to the first floor, only to discover that it has three levels which could pose a problem for disabled people, or when carrying heavy luggage. One level has stairs, and the other has a ramp that is pretty dangerous to walk on. The rooms are of decent size, but the sound proofing is horrible. The floor is wooden under the carpet and every step makes the entire room shake. The walls are paper thin and you will hear every step your neighbors take. The bathroom has no air ventilation and this was pretty horrible. They don't even put an air freshener in there. You are forced to open the room windows every time someone visits the bathroom and with the cold October air this was not a pleasant experience. The main light switch controls the electricity running the two bedside lamps which means you cannot have one open without opening the main light. You can't even use the socket to charge your electronic devices at night (there are no free sockets, just the TV and the fridge's) The breakfast was pretty good, good variety and service. A thing we found to be pretty unsafe, the signs leading to the emergency staircase point to the wrong door. At least two signs we saw on our floor.

No porter service offered (yes there is a lift but you have to still get up some awkward stairs that are not serviced by the lift.). We left and would not stay it was so bad. I think the people that say its good are dreaming or have exceptionally low standards.

We were allocated room 2008 on the 2nd floor.(there is a lift) The ROOM was a nice size. It overlooked a residence, therefore you had to keep your curtains closed at night. The room was very dark, lack of lamps. On the skirting board below the bed, there was a spill stain, it had obviously been there for ages, not the cleanest hotel, but on first sight it looks ok until you really look. The BATHROOM reminded me of a fish market slab, there was very BAD MOULD around the shower and tiles, the shower was either v.hot or v.cold. They only provided shower/shampoo gel and some soap, would have expected more for the price. We had to chase the maid every day to leave us two bath towels,bath mat, toilet rolls and tooth mugs. For some reason she forgot to leave them, she was a 'shilling short.' BREAKFAST, this was a mixture of dried up cheese, rubber/cold scrambled eggs and over cooked bacon. When they refreshed the eggs, they threw them in from a distance, it was clear they could not care less. There was tinned fruit in syrup and runny yogurt. The bread was nice and fresh. The breakfast staff had a bad attitude problem, never a smile, they do not clear plates until you leave the table. The dishcloths they use to wipe the tables were a FILTHY GREY. It was very NOISY at NIGHTwith druggies shouting and scooters roaring, not a good nights sleep in 4 nights. The blanket was ripped and the beadspread was stained, the mattress had not been cleaned in ages, the dust on the TV had been there for months. THE FRIDGE had mould in it and was not very efficient. Upon check out, there was no 'thank you/goodbye' THE LOCATION WAS GREAT,NEXT TO DAM SQUARE AND TRAMS. The reception staff were pleasant enough. We would not stay there again, it is not worth the money, it is more a 2 star hotel. THE PILLOWS were very LUMPY, you can request some thicker ones, even so they are horrid. Not worth the money, we felt cheated. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL UNLESS ALL YOU WANT IS GOOD LOCATION. It is so basic. For the price I would have expected better service. Perhaps the Dutch are not known for their service! If you want a great place to eat, just turn the corner and eat in the Chinese,(the first one you come to, CANNOT REMEMBER THE NAME) it is great value. This is an honest review.

We didn't think it was a big deal. 6. Breakfast was just fine! Hot scrambled eggs, hot rice with green and red peppers, muffins, toast, cheeses and (canned) fruit and cereal were more than adequate. Much better than the usual continental breakfasts. (Turn right upon exiting the hotel and right again at the corner...go half a block to Rene's pastries if you are still hungry).

The walls are very thin - conversation from adjoining rooms could be easily heard. 3. The overall quality is basic - not even a 'do not disturb' hanger for the door - and the room attendants do start quite early. 4. Our room only had a shower and the shower 'well' is so shallow the water easily goes all over the floor. 5. Although we had booked a double in a no-smoking room some weeks in advance when we arrived we were allocated a twin. The only alternative was a double in a smoking room. Their allocation procedure seemed to be a mix of computer and written sheet - not very efficient. 6. Breakfast was also basic - yes there is bread, preserves, fruit etc. but the bread was virtually all toasting bread, the preserves were of a poor quality and the fruit consisted of tinned fruit cocktail, tinned pear halves and very little else. There was also thinly sliced ham but some nice Dutch cheese. If you are bothered more about quantity than quality then you can stoke up for the day but not with anything special. 7. There were some cooked items - however, the only eggs were scrambled. If they were fresh into the hot containers then that was fine but they appeared to be kept over a dry heat so quickly dried out and became very unappetising. To be fair whilst the hotel appeared busy and whilst we ate breakfast at different times during our stay we did not encounter any queues nor had a problem getting a table. We only noticed 1 lift but had no problems during our stay. There is a baggage room and the reception staff were very helpful with us leaving our bags on the day of departure.

My main complaints are these: the walls are thin, so you hear any noise. If you're there in the summer, there seems to be no air conditioning, and the room can get really hot. They have a storage room to hold your luggage the day you leave, but this is totally unsafe as anyone can go in and take any luggage. And, finally, be careful about how they charge you. I was over-charged for one night by a particular staff member who knew I had nowhere to stay (despite the other reviews, I didn't find all the staff that hospitable; some were, some were not). When I went to pay the next morning, I luckily was saved by another staff member who couldn't undersatnd why i was over-charged 50 euros.

On first impression when we found the doorway into the hotel, we were all very impressed with how clean, tidy and very presentable the place was. It is a converted museum or hall or something because the main reception is huge and very grand looking. We were welcomed by a nice lady who spoke great english and who booked us in and gave us our door card to room 111 which was at the back of the hotel. We entered the room to be impressed again which was very clean and tidy with all amenities inc: tv, bath/shower, towels, wardrobe with hangers, fridge, fan, hairdryer, table and chairs, bedside lamps, full length mirror, big wide opening window (although never any breeze) and not to forget 3 very nicley made soft clean comfy beds. The next morning we all went to breakfast and again we were all very impressed with the buffet they had put on. The range to pick from was tremendous, oh my they had it all except slice sausage and tattie scone, which we soon forgot about because of the choice we had in front of us. So all in all this hotel was absolute perfect for 3 lads going to amsterdam for the weekend.
