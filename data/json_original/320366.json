Granted, the hotel is not a 4 star hotel given my experience of 4 star hotels in Ireland. However this hotel is grand, it was clean, the rooms were grand, there was plenty of hot water, the staff were friendly and very helpful. The location of the hotel is excellent as it is only a few minutes walk to the Via Veneto and from there we were able to walk to all the main sights.

Even the floors were warped. The beds had some ugly used up green spreads, the shower was a shower head in a little tiny plastic enclosure. It was hot and stressful there. Forget the breakfast. We left after I saw what passed for hot chocolate. Reading all these recent reviews, I see the place hasn't changed in 5 years. The rooms look nothing like the pictures. I checked the web when I got home and saw the pictures they posted. An absolute lie. Stay anywhere else. There are Best Westerns there, at least you would have some recourse for such a rip off.
