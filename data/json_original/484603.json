Internet is expensive (3euro/hr) & not accessible from the rooms. My single bed was a cheap cot bed/roll away bed in an extremely small room. Small room is fine but the hostel bed is not acceptable in a hotel. My sleep was lousy because of the mini-sized \"twin\" bed & I kept hitting the wall because the bed is right against the wall.

I booked through Hotels.com, who did not do a good job to help me either (supervisor answered didn't know a thing about negotiation 101) & just let me deal w/it myself.

He told me there no double room to upgrade me, which he lied. My friend called to ask for a double room for the night & was told there are availabilities.

However, I need not have worried! Sure, it's not in the centre of the action, but who wants to be right in the thick of it all with noisy traffic and tiny rooms for extortionate prices? The hotel is very near a metro stop, and it only takes 15 minutes or so to get into the centre of Rome. A pleasure when you are used to hour long commutes in London! Using the Metro is only 1 euro per trip, so you are hardly spending a fortune getting in and out. We also used the bus on one occassion to get into Rome and this was quick and painless. The hotel is clean and tidy and the rooms large. My only concern would be that we were placed on the ground floor so did not have the best view (of the service area outside) but there was a nice garden seating area nearby so this was not a worry. The air conditioning was great and kept us cool all night. Breakfast had a good selection, not the worlds best quality food but enough to set you up for the day, plenty of pastries, bread and cakes and some hot food too in the way of eggs and bacon. Surprisingly lovely coffee from the coffee machines. Staff were knowledgeable and helpful. We asked for directions to the catacombs and the reception fellow was happy to help. We were going to use the internet in the hotel but at three euro for an hour we found this too much. The receptionist told us to go around the corner where there was an internet cafe where we went online for one euro an hour. Great service!

The rooms reminded me of a football camp stay I had in a northern seaside town in England called Morecambe (or Blackpool). The fittings were very cheap and worn out. The televisions were outdated and the volume did not work. There was signs that damp had been removed from the bathroom and the bed mattresses were bare - you could feel the springs coming through. Two single beds pushed together seems to be the way in Italy, which was fine. Also for the rate, they provided free dressing gown and slippers. I would have preferred to have free wi-fi (not 5 euro an hour!) and a cheaper room rate...140 euro was a bit steep. In the UK, I would pay \u00a340 / night maximum. The walls were also very thin and before we checked out of our 30 minute stay we could hear the family next door shouting at each other. In the end myself and my partner decided we could not stay and booked another hotel which was much better, more central and a completely different standard. I asked if there were any better rooms than the 'Superior Double' I booked, and I was told there were no other rooms available. Plus points: - Staff friendly and helpful; Negatives: - Hotel condition; - Hotel furnishings; - Hotel nowhere near a 3*.

The breakfast was amazing for a hotel like this - I wouldn't call it American, more european (with a stab at bacon, eggs and beans!) but plenty to eat in the morning. The only downsides for this hotel is it's initial location - it says it's 100m from the metro - but it didn't say which exit to get out of (there are 3) so we ended up walking for ages trying to find it. When we did finally get the right exit it is literally a 2 minute walk. I would suggest taking a routemap with you out of the metro and to the Hotel which we forgot to do. You need exit 'Boccea via Pari'. The metro was amazing though - and whilst the hotel is quite far out, I think it probably is easier to get to the main sites than some of the more central hotels that aren't on a metro line. It takes about 12 minutes to get to the Cornelia metro from Termini station which is amazing considering it is quite far out. Also the walls are quite thin. Also don't be put off by the area the hotel is in - itilially it looks quite run down until you realise the whole of Rome is covered in graffiti!!

However, we woke up the following morning to find insects in the bath, cockroaches on the floor and by the curtains. (As it was a ground floor room and the windows opened straight onto the pavement.) My partner complained and we was moved straight away and they couldnt have done more for us. We were moved, and upgraded to a lovely room with a balcony, which was lovely. The room was very spacious and was cleaned every day without fail. It is quite noisy around the hotel but thats to be expected in a city. Breakfast in the morning was continental, it was very nice. although I did miss my bacon but we both grew a bit tired of eating the same foods every morning after 8 days. At the top of the road there is a bus station so if the metro isnt for you there are plenty of busses about and we had no trouble getting on them or finding out where they went. In 8 days we managed to see everything we wanted to in Rome and always had a nice clean room to return to after a long day sightseeing. At night, we usually ate at the resturant at the top of the road 'Lo Zio Frankie' I think it was called. They were very friendly and the food was gorgeous. It was set outside with lights and trellace around the resturant so it was a lovely setting with the sun going down. It was reasonably priced and if we went back to Rome, we'd love to go back there. We were given free shots and cherries after our meal which was very nice.

The only thing which I can imagine is that they stayed in one of the renovated rooms which look really nice on the website - but the reality is that they only have a small limited number of these rooms. As you will see from the pictures I will post along with the review the room bears no resemblance to the pictures available online. I'll start with the good as this is a short list: * The bed is reasonably comfortable. The few hours which I managed to sleep, I slept quite well. * Air-conditioning in every room - Probably a must in Rome as it was 28 degrees (about 82 fahrenheit) at the beginning of October so I could not imagine how horrible it would be in the middle of summer if air-conditionining was not available. * Breakfast - The food was reasonable and included in the price of the overnight stay. The juices were plain dreadful, and the coffee was not good - it dispelled the myth that you cannot get a bad coffee in Italy. * Language - Most of the staff spoke reasonably good English (which I would expect from hotel reception staff) which made it quite easy to communicate. The bad: * Location - The hotel is in a not particularly nice area of Rome. Lot of garbage on the streets, overflowing dumpsters and what did not feel like a very safe area. The hotel encourages the use of the air-conditioning in order to keep the windows closed to prevent burglary (not kidding they had a sign in each room stating that!) Getting anywhere near the sites takes a 5 minute walk (brisk) to the Metro station and then about a 20 minute Metro ride. Not particularly central. * Water pressure - The room I stayed in was on the 3rd floor. The water pressure was so weak that it was not even pushing water through all the holes in the shower head - I have included a picture of the shower head pointing to the ceiling with full pressure and it only sprayed about 2 to 3 inches above the shower head. The morning after the first night I went down to complain and they told me that a large group had checked out and that it affected the pressure. The second morning I went down and asked if they had a large group checking out that morning and with a puzzled look they told me no, so I asked what the reason for the lack of water pressure was this morning on the 3rd floor... to which he answered \"Oh let me change your room.\" * Noise - The walls are paper thin. The hotel adjoins an apartment building, and my room was next to an apartment where at 4am I got woken up by coughing and then a barrage of cabinets and drawers being opened and slammed closed. Then at about 5 someone either in the room next to mine or above mine got up and took a shower - all of which I could hear loud and clear. * Attitude of staff - Unfortunately for some of the staff, I speak Spanish, which is close enough to Italian for me to reasonably understand a conversation. The main language I spoke was English and the general attitude and comments to some of their colleagues about me were quite surprising. Imagine their shock when in my broken Italian I told them that I speak Spanish and understand Italian quite well. * Elevator - The carpet in the elevator was nasty and there was frequently quite pungent smells in there. On the plus side, it was so nasty that I opted to use the stairs more often than the elevator - which is better for my health. * Mold around the window and in some of the tile grout - The bathroom was reasonably modern, but there was quite a bit of mold around the window and in some of the tile grout - so if I was alergic I may have had some serious problems. * Room Key - I went up to my room and the key would not open the door. It was quite frustrating. I went back to the front desk and the person behind the desk was quite condescending. He walked with me to the elevator and pointed and told me my room was on the 3rd floor and I should be able to find it! I repeated that I knew where the room was but the key did not work, so he begrudgingly came up to the room with me. I handed him the key and it did not work for him either. After several italian curse words and a significant amount of jostling the key, he was able to finally open it. It was quite a frustrating process each time I had to go back to my room. * \"Wi-Fi available\" - Despite the sign on the front desk reception proclaiming that Wi-Fi is available in the hotel, good luck finding a Wi-Fi signal! * No light switch near the bed and no night stand (although there is no room for it) - Fortunately there was a remote control for the TV, so I could turn on the TV turn off the light, and get into bed with the light from the TV and then turn off the TV not ideal, and it is the first time that I have ever stayed in a hotel where this was the case. The ugly: * The entire decor is quite gaudy. The lobby does not look horrible, but as soon as you go up to the floors where the rooms are it is dark, dirty and musty. * The room decor makes the place look like a funeral home. The colors are really dark and in a style which would be right at home sometime in the late 1800's. The walls are covered with material and padding - so I can honestly say I stayed in a padded room. The entire experience was just plain dreadful, and I would strongly discourage anyone considering this hotel from staying there.", "Date": "October 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Essex", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel But Poor Location\u201d", "Author": "NDRT", "ReviewID": "UR8722876", "Content": "Me and my Nan stayed at the Hotel Waldorf from Wednesday 12th September until 15th September. We travelled to Rome Ciapino by Ryanair, would definatly fly with them again, it was excellent value for money and the flight was smooth. We took a terravision bus from the airport to the Termini station which is about 45 minutes from the airport. From Termini we too the metro line A to Cornelia which took about 20minutes. We brought a Carta integrata Settimanale ticket which was excellent value for money which we could use on all forms of transport in Rome to reach the main attractions. The metro is a very pleasent experience compared to London. Most of the trains have air conditioning which meant in the 32 degree heat we were all nice and cool. At arrival to Cornelia station it was a 5 minute walk to the hotel, it was very hard locating the hotel, I had to ask a few of the locals for directions, but once you are able to find your way there once, you will have no problems finding it again. The hotel itself is very nice although it is in a very strange location in a quiet residential street which is along distance from the main attractions of Rome. I would not want to stay at the hotel on my own and would not have felt very safe walking in the night on my own to and from the hotel. The B and H hotels have other chains of hotel much closer to the centre of Rome which might be more ideal for children and famililies. This hotel is ok if the are on a package holiday with a tour company with a coach which picks you up from the hotel takes you sight seeing and then brings you back to the hotel. You can reach the main attractions from the hotel by the wide variety of different transport systems in Rome which come very frequently, you need to have your ticket before you go onto the bus, train etc. If you do not mind having to travel into the main centre and out again which is very tiring after sightseeing all day this hotel is for you otherwise think about getting a hotel which is more central. Although the hotel is excellent value for money I think the hotel should be cheaper because of where it is located in the middle of no where. I booked a superior room and was surprised to find that the extra trimmings were not in my room but I spoke to the manager and quickly a porter brought all the necessary things to my room. The Rome was fine for the two of us and anyway we did not need anything luxary as we spent a very limited time in our room. Although it could have had a larger window in the room as our room only had a small balcony door to let light through so it was very dark in our room and we needed to turn the lights on even in the day time. The hotel is very large I think I prefer the smaller hotels. You have to provide a 30 euro deposit to have the air conditioning controller and ask for your mini fridge to be opened on arrival. The breakfast at the hotel is out of this world experience, wide range of different products on offer, everything you ever wanted to get you through the day until dinner is provided different cheeses, meats, breads, scrambled eggs, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, jam, chocolate spread, honey, pastry, cakes, tea, coffee, hot. chocolate, water. The hotels restaurant was closed for some reason during our stay their is a few local restaurants near the hotel if you can not face having to travel into the centre of Rome after sightseeing.

Was easiest to get a 3 day pass on the Metro and went to all the stops we wanted to see. 2. Lot of graffitti in the area... we weren't bothered but be wary. Weird things: 1. Before this stay I've never before had to pay a deposit for my remote to work the air conditioning (for a room I've already paid for in advance!). Maybe I look like a college kid (am a 30-something) - but the front desk man said something about people stealing the air conditioners or the remotes. Yeah... right. The ceiling is at least 10 feet and I'm 5 ft tall... Of course, he made no mention of the A/C deposit when we first checked in - we went to our room and it was hot. So I had to go back downstairs...and argh... let's just say that this front desk man couldn't be bothered or didn't believe customer service is a redeeming value. He wanted 30 euro cash for the deposit - but I only had 20 pounds coming from England. (I did get my deposit back in full.) To insure I got it back I locked the remote in my luggage during the day. 2. Internet access: Get a card w/ a code as soon as you can and keep it. This is the dumbest business decision I have ever encountered. I'm sure they have their \"reasons\" but customer satisfaction is last on the list. In order to use the computers for the Internet - you got a card with a code. It was 3 euros/hr and you could refill or top up the card. DON'T give it back until you know you are done w/ the Internet. They only have a certain number of cards and if they are out...no internet for you even if there's no one at the computers. To add on to that - the cards are tied to a specific computer. We went down 3 different times with no luck. And one lady had to wait for someone else to finish with the computer he was on - despite the fact the other was available because the cards were tied to a specific computer. There are some internet cafes nearby - but running old versions of windows that don't pull up the graphics on web sites. Very frustrating. 3. Breakfast - was average at best and nothing to write home about by any means. A mediocre buffet - I've had better buffets and friendly service at the Hampton Inn in the US. All in all - it might be worth it to spend a little more and get something a little nicer. But it's better than a hostel.

The food left a lot to be desired, they only offered a set menu which consisted of four courses, first was meats & cheese, next was a bland tasting attempt at lasagne, followed by a pork chop, fried chips & a weird looking artichoke flower which was soggy and not very tasty ( i did try it before concluding it was disgusting) our dessert was a springy blamange.

At first glance it appears to be too far outside of the centre of Rome and I was nervous about this at first but it was perfectly situated.

The area seems as decent as any other city area I've been to and gives you an insight into the normal way of live, not just the tourist attractions. The metro costs 1 euro regardless of where you are going and takes about 5 mins to get to the Vatican and about 12 mins to get to the Termini. When we arrived At Ciampino airport we got a Terravision bus to the Termini which cost 8 euro each and then a taxi from the Termini to the hotel cost us around 20 euros (make sure you have a good map that shows where the hotel is with you and the name of the street written down as the taxi drivers couldn't understand our terrible pronunciation and so we resorted to showing them on the map.) It was after midnight when we were at the Termini, we had no problems and were even greeted by a random official tourist information officer with a badge who seemed to be randomly wandering round the area looking after the tourists and generally making them feel safe. The room was tastefully plainly decorated and was perfectly clean. The guests arriving back late at night in adjoining rooms seemed a little noisy but i think the walls were just thin, we turned the airconditioning on and that was enough to drown them out. The bathroom had a hairdryer and a very well lit, large mirror it was lovely and clean with both a short bath and a shower.

Over all, very good value for money.", "Date": "November 23, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "B&H Waldorf", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d484603-Reviews-B_H_Waldorf-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$74 - $178*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Andrea Alciato 14-16</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00167</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "484603", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/df/e8/dfe8c9f3ef91a8ede97e090a91ec2f776large.jpg"}}
