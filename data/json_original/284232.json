She chose it mostly for its location and proximity to Central Station. The hotel is very convenient to walk to all attractions in the city; nothing was more than a \u00c2\u00bd hour walk. When we arrived the desk clerk was very helpful and cheery. Our room was on the fourth floor and was part of the attic space. We were in Holland during a very warm spring and with no ac in the hotel, the room was very warm. Fortunately the windows opened and we both use earplugs. The beds were small low singles with a thin lumpy mattress, I slept not too bad but my wife complained about her back in the morning. The washroom is poorly equipped, there are no hooks or shelves to put anything on or store your towels. When you have a shower you have to just leave the towel on the floor or across the room in the sink. The toilet is what I can best describe as a shelf style that if you haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen one of these old styles before will definitely encourage you to finish quickly or flush and hope for no splash back. It must have been the first design improvement to the Asian squat toilet. Basically a flushing outhouse. The hotel advertized free wireless internet but the system didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. I inquired at the desk and was told that it was new and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work yet, that was why it was free. When they get it operational they are going to charge for it. So remember it is only free because it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. They did have a computer in the lobby that you can use for now if you can get some time on it. That is also not going to be provided for free in the future. My wife needed to make a call to her cousin so we could meet him for dinner one night and found out that you cannot make outside calls anywhere in the hotel. If you are like us and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a mobile or don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to pay exorbitant roaming charges, you have very limited options. There are some but not many pay phones in the city (we only found two that weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t broken), but they only work with what is called a chip card (basically a prepaid phone card). There are no retailer of these cards anywhere in the vicinity of the phones and the only retailer we found was at central station a \u00c2\u00bd hour walk away. There is however no phones in central station so we had to walk \u00c2\u00bd hour walk back to the phone near dam square. A continental breakfast is provided and is above par. Lots of different breads, cheeses, meats, cereals, fresh fruits, juices and hard boiled eggs. You can make a hearty enough breakfast to last you till dinner. I am sure some of the younger guests were making sandwiches to take with them. A sign asks you not to take the food out but many had sandwich bags that they put their lunches in. All in all our stay at the Koopermoolens hotel was acceptable, but at 130 Euro a night it was overpriced. During our stay the hotel was booked up so we might have been paying a premium. I would think the hotel realistically was worth more in the 80 to 100 Euro a night range in busy season and much less in the off season.", "Date": "April 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cLocation and helpful staff\u201d", "Author": "SydneyBill", "ReviewID": "UR84579373", "Content": "Stayed here for 2 nights and will be happy to stay there again in the future.

We had been to a concert and planned to wander the streets/do a spot of midnight sight-seeing/have a nap in Central Station if need be before catching an early train to Germany the following day. However, it got to 2.30am and our feet were killing us, Central Station was closed and we just wanted somewhere to lie down. After knocking on various doors and being quoted ridiculous prices, we visited the sister hotel of the Koopermoolen (I can't remember what it was called!) and they couldn't help, but the night manager was kind enough to put us in touch with this hotel. We bartered down to a very cheap rate of \u00c2\u00a356 for a room (amazing value for something this central at short notice) and checked in. The guy on reception was very nice. He had a tattoo on his neck and was very funny. He was having to deal with some crazy \"regular\" who was after a bed for the night also - this guy was bare chested, sweating and had a Cockney accent - if we weren't so knackered we'd have been mortified at what we were potentially letting ourselves in for, but were too tired to care and the receptionist really was a comedian! He ended up giving us a triple room as that was all that was left which made the \u00c2\u00a356 price even more appealing. The room was really hot, even with the windows open, but hey, it's July in Amsterdam, what do you expect? Our train out of the Dam was in 3 hours time and we just wanted a disco nap so we didn't care. There were a few dubious stains on the top sheets (because of the heat, we didn't bother to actually LIFT the top sheets, the actual bedsheets may have been pristine underneath, I guess we'll never know!) but we just laid out our towels (which were clean, hoorah!) and fell asleep on top of them. The room had it's own shower and toilet (so rare to find this in a hotel of this price category in central amsterdam!) which seemed to be in good condition and working order, although we didn't use the shower due to lack of time. Yeah, there was a fair bit of noise from the street below but again, what do you expect? We were so tired, we got the 3 hours sleep we wanted in a safe, comfortable room that was a stones throw from Central Station and was two thirds cheaper than the price of what all the other hotels were asking. Also, breakfast was included in the rate - again, such a rarity! It was quite cute as the receptionist had asked us if we required a wake-up call before we went to bed the night before and when we came down into reception at 6.15am, he was fast asleep in his chair! He raced downstairs to put the lights on in the breakfast room and left us to help ourselves after grabbing a few essentials out of the fridge (milk and some fruit etc) Everything else - the cereal, the breads had presumably been left there all night and for God knows how many days before that, so we reluctantly ate the \"safe\" stuff and didn't touch any of the cold meats/cheese although in fairness, it all looked very nice and contrary to what other reviewers have said, there seemed to be a fair bit of choice. To summarise, this hotel does exactly what it says on the tin. It gives you 2 star standards in a great location. I observed the price list in reception and the rack rate for our room was allegedly over 200 Euros and to be honest, you'd be a fool to pay that although I'm sure less seasoned travellers than myself would fall for it but places like this are happy to let you barter - I mean, we wandered in at 2.30am, who else was gonna sleep in that room and spend \u00c2\u00a356? Certainly not the crazy Cockney! I would stay again if I was in the same predicament, but I very much doubt I ever will be although I'd definitely pop by the Koopermoolen again just to say hi to the owner for being such a good entertainer and a thoroughly nice bloke for saving 2 young ladies from a night of horror on the streets of Amsterdam!", "Date": "July 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "N.

We were not disappointed. The luggage room was down a very narrow corridor, it was small and cramped (but then we discovered this was typical of many things in Amsterdam) and difficult to move around in. However, it was secure and did the job. Check in and out were smooth and the staff were very helpful. One person and 2 suitcases (just) fit into the lift which almost stopped on the floor of the suite which we had booked. Climbing into the suite was like going up a bunkbed ladder and required significant physical effort to manoeuvre our luggage up there. The bottom of the stairs was next to the door to the lift machinery room which was inside the suite and noises from within could be heard during the night, along with the slamming of the lift door. As it's also well placed on a busy street, don't bother staying if you want peace and quiet. It didn't disrupt our sleep after a busy day walking. The room itself was interesting. The bed was a contiboard construction, fine for sleeping but was very uncomfortable for laying on and watching the portable TV or reading. It was also quite high and the edges of the boards made it a bruising experience. The jacuzzi, in the middle of the room (almost) with a shower head protuding through the ceiling above it, made bathing a public experience as there was no dividing curtain or screen (neither were there any blinds or curtains on the frosted windows that overlooked the street from the bath area). Thankfully, there was a separate toilet and sink. The wardrobe was tiny and we just managed to store our 5 days worth of clothing. The carpet between the bedroom and toilet was badly worn and looked shabby, other fixtures and fittings were in a reasonable state of repair and YES the jacuzzi did work.

The bathroom was disgusting, and the glass is clear plain glass, so you have got blinds to pull for privacy, but only some !!!

We found the staff to be arrogant, extremely unhelpful and they seemed to disappear everytime there was a problem. Firstly they overcharged us, we argued about this, however eventually accepted and paid up. They then charged us 5 euros each to put our valuables, money and passports in their safety deposit boxes behind the counter in reception, which did not seem to be unreasonable. They were very anxious for us to use the safety deposit boxes and it soon became apparent why. When we went to check out of the hotel and take the valuables out of the boxes the passports were there but no money. The receptionist did not seem to be suprised and when I asked to see the CCTV footage, suprise, surprise there were no cameras on the safety deposit boxes, although they were everywhere else in the building and outside. After wasting two hours of our last day the owners son turned up at the hotel and went through the footage in a downstairs room with only one of our party (on fast forward). The owners son then offered to pay part of the money back but I said we were going to the police, the receptionist who was working when the money went missing said he would follow us to the police station. We made our report with the police and surprise, suprise he never showed up at the police station, so we went back to the hotel. He had apparently gone home and was no due back in until after 7pm even though he usually starts work at 4pm. Luckily enough we were not travelling home until late on so we told them we would be back. After getting the police report and going back to the hotel after 7, we showed the report to the receptionist and gave them a copy for their records. The receptionist denied he was going to follow us to the police station and blamed everybody apart from himself.

I stayed there for five nites with my girlfriend. The room was ok although it looked nothing like the double room picture advertised on the site. First of all I'll comment on the staff..One of them was very helpful and friendly. The others came across as slightly arrogant. Not very helpful. Always sitting around in the lobbey smoking pot (its amsterdam..what do you expect i guess)..still..its not something u would expect to see in a hotel lobbey..the dont help you with your bags and the lift is tiny (about 1 square metre)..if you have a lot of luggage ur screwed.. When we eventually got to the room we thought \"its not bad..could have been worse\"..from the horror stories i had read about some hotel rooms in amsterdam this seemed ok..dont get me wrong..you get what you pay for..its one of the cheaper hotels so dont expect amazing rooms.we paid 370 euro for a double room for five nights. i think we were lucky enough to get one of the better rooms..i think if you have a room pre-booked you probably get the better ones. the only complaints i have about the room were the shower handle was broken which meant u had to hold it while showering(not too serious), the noise at night was terrible but thats what you get when you book a hotel in central amsterdam... the room was small but besides that it was just ok..i would give the room a three out of five.. the heating was working..the blankets were very light which didnt suit my girlfriend..she likes the heat..the tv worked..it is advertised that you can purchase movies to watch in your room..however when we asked at the desk they said the system was down..they seemed to find it very funny.. There was no telephone.. You can smoke in the room which is convenient. The bedside light worked..Aside from the shower the bathroom was fine.. it is very close to everything..very close to all the coffeeshops and red light district..and central station is only a 5/10 minute walk away.. Basically I agree with the other reviews..I can see why people were unhappy with the rooms. We were lucky to get a room with only minor things wrong with it..

On the plus side, breakfast was quite acceptable, (but in a room more like a university refrectory)and the location is central, albeit very close to red light district.", "Date": "November 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "scotland/glasgow", "Title": "\u201cnot to good\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4103171", "Content": "our first night we had a room with a view to a back alley that had a really bad smell.we then were moved room the next day to a bigger room but the windows didnt open and the room was rather hot.breakfast was great location is excellent.", "Date": "November 10, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Palm Beach", "Title": "\u201cOK but won't stay again\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2874855", "Content": "My husband and I were on our honeymoon and Amsterdam was the last stop on our European vacation.

Firstly I had booked large double rooms with 'Kingsize beds' (internet description!). When we arrived, our friends were given a room with no window!! Bathroom was absolutely tiny and 2 of the lights were broken in the room! When we were shown our room, it had 2 single beds, with cigarrette burns all over the quilt covers! The noise was unbelievable from the street. Now don't get me wrong, we never had any intention of spending any time in the hotel - only to sleep, but u couldn't even do that. My friends were told they would get to change rooms the 2nd night, because it was soo stuffy what with no windows n all, they had just gotten engaged, so the hotel staff said they were being transferred to the nicest room they had - wait for it - another 2 single beds! Staff were ok to be fair, but the hotel is a glorified hostel. However, it is slap bang in the middle of things so for that, it cannot be faulted.

I later contacted the hotel and booked, giving my credit card as guarentee, but paid no deposite. On arrival I was asked to pay for my 7 nights stay at reception. Told the man I needed to see the room first. Then my suspicions were arroused ! I was told to take the lift to the 4th floor, walk to my right as far as I could, up another flight of stairs and it was the last room on the right. The lift by the way was more like an upright coffin ! When I saw the tiny atic room my spirits dropped even further. Im 6ft 2in and I could not get into the the apology for a shower and toilet.The very small bed took up all the floor space.

The hotel was excellent, the staff were all freindly and helpful - also good for a laugh. The hotel was VERY clean and tidy. I never made breakfast once but others in the group said there was plenty of it - continental style. I read in some other reviews about the area feeling unsafe (different hotels in the same street). Behind the hotel is the red light district the front street leads to DAM square about 5 mins walk. Our group did not see any problems in the 3 days we stayed there so do not be put off - I'd say its feels a lot safer than London. Its not the Hilton but I would say better value for money (only \u00e2\u201a\u00ac55/night/person).

We thought it was OK maybe a little basic but ideally located to live in the middle of the old part of the city. Further along the same road are a number of coffee shops where the customers clearly weren't just sharing expressos and a number of sex shops and gay clubs but they're all aspects of Amsterdam.This part of the city also has some wonderful restaurants, cosy little bars ( brown cafe's) and quaint side streets along the canals which all add up to a unique atmosphere where we felt entirely safe day and night. The hotel is a typical old local house. Our room was on the front at third floor level. It was triangular in shape with three windows ( that couldn't be openened) facing the main street so there was some noise at nights until the early morning. We had a comfortable bed, ensuite shower, wash basin and loo. Everything was reasonably clean, not spotless and not luxurious. Reception could do with brightening up, but the staff were friendly and helpful. The lift was useful as the stairs are extremely steep and winding. The only other facilities were the breakfast restaurant in the basement. This was a buffet of ham, cheese, egg, sliced breads, cereal, yoghurt, fruit juice and a choice of hot drinks - all fresh, as much as you liked and included in the price of the room. We thought overall it was good value, had real characterand was located ideally for seeing old Amsterdam on foot and by boat.
