Initially, the impression I had for Inns were rather run down, but America's Value Inn at North Alvarado Street turns out to be a different perspective. Walked down the street along the main road about 5 minutes, you can find lots of Mexican food, Subway, Starbucks.

Where to begin?\u201d", "Author": "SebS26", "ReviewID": "UR62532987", "Content": "The story of our stay: 1. We find the place online. $62? Great. And it looks like it's right by Silverlake and the freeway. Perfect. 2. We arrive. Turns out it's not quite in Silverlake. A little closer to Shadesville. Coming inside, we're greeted by the lovely and inviting Plexiglas window to protect the desk clerk. Good for him. Where's ours? 3. We begin to sense a vague creepiness that we just can't pinpoint. I'm not normally picky about hotels. When I'm on vacation I come to the hotel to sleep and shower; all I ask is that it be quiet and clean. And it seemed to be ok. The room looked fine at first - decent size, clean-ish bathroom, functioning internet, normal motel amenities. But something just felt \"off\" here. 4. We notice that there is something alive in the wall. Some kind of insect or rodent noise coming from *inside* the wall between the main room and the bathroom. It didn't sound like a cricket or cicada but it wasn't a pipe or heater noise either. My girlfriend begins to freak out. 5. The brown thing. We find an approx. 1 inch roundish clump of a brown unidentified substance on the floor next to the bed. It looks somewhere between a dessicated poo and a clump of coffee grounds. There is no coffee maker in the room. I can't prove that it was poo, but it sure wasn't pleasant. 6. We decide we're leaving. It's 11:30 the same night we arrived and we abandon ship for a normal motel in actual Silverlake. This is the first time in my life I've ever done this. As if to confirm we made the right choice, we notice a sign in the stairwell stating that \"products used or sold on these premises contain chemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer.\" I don't know if this is a common thing, but it was the first time I'd noticed that sign anywhere. 7. On a positive note, the night clerk was very pleasant when we checked out. 8. My girlfriend's cell phone - in her purse - mysteriously called mine as we were driving away. I wonder what Ghost Hunters would turn up at this place.

It lies on Sunset Boulevard, which can be a very busy road. The hotel was very noisy due to the noise from the street, I couldn't sleep very well. But besides that the hotel is decent. The rooms are not very large, but they are clean. The bathroom was very clean as well. The television worked fine. Everyday, two new free bottles of water were put on my desk by the cleaning ladies, which was a nice welcome present for hot LA. However do bring your own shampoo, it is not provided by the hotel as I expected. The cleaners don't speak English, but the people behind the desk do and are very friendly. There is no internet in this hotel, but they when you ask they will refer you to the nearby Motel 8 hotel, where you can use internet at $1 per 10 minutes, which I found pretty expensive. However if you have a laptop with you, you might want to try and find a wireless network. In the morning you can take a free breakfast, which consists of not too good coffee and a biscuit. This is nice to overcome the time to go out and find a good breakfast place in the neighbourhood (which I never really found). There is a restaurant next to the hotel, it is maybe even part of the hotel, that wasn't very clear. However, I entered this place once, and never went back, it didn't look very clean. There is a bus stop nearby the hotel and this was very convenient, bus n2 runs to beverly hills. Hollywood and the walk of fame are only 10 minutes walk away from the hotel. The metro station Hollywood/western is 5 minutes walking from the hotel. The neighbourhood didn't look very safe at first sight, it is a more poverish part of sunset boulevard.
