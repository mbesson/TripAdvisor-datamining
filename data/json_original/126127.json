If shuttle is full for a time slot request they add another especially at sunset. It would have been easier to stay closer to town for flexibility of coming and going but having a suite with 4 people and beach was a good trade off. I think I would stay near southern most point next time there are beachfront properties that are closer to Duvall st. Families with teens might like having convenience of everything closer to hotel. Everything was at least 2 miles from Sheraton Places to eat: Camilles a must for breakfast best eggs Benedict, garbos grill (little cart on side of road down street from conch bar) fantastic fish tacos, Flaming Bouys for dinner- exceptional fresh food, the best key lime martini and fresh coconut drinks plus good lunch were at WhiteTarpon.

Have you ever started out your vacation and felt like you would just rather stay home... that lasted only about 15 minutes after arriving at this hotel. We had a miscomunication with the hotel and the shuttle did not show up to pick us up at the airport. So we waited about forty five minutes and decided to get a taxi. The ride from the airport to the hotel was not very pleasant because the taxi piled four people in one hot smelly litte car and charged us all full fare! So when we arrived at the hotel I was hot, and sweaty, and very angery. I told Fotis Tsaganis, the hotel manager, that I didn't appreciate being stood-up at the airport. He sincerely told me that he was sorry about the misunderstanding. We went up to the room to decide how long we were going to stay at this hotel when I got a knock on the door. Fotis again apologized for our inconvenience, reimbursed me for the taxi, and then brought us a six pack beer. I have had some apologies from hotel managers in the past but none that included money and beer. The rest of our stay was wonderful. The staff was great and very helpful and knowledgable about the island and activities. The pool and bar area is a great place for getting some sun and relaxation. The beach is just across the street and you can reserve a shuttle to go down town. Once you get down town don't worry about getting back. The drop off zone for the shuttle is at a great bar. You can wait for the shuttle, every half hour, hail a taxi, $8, or just walk . Taxis are plentiful and everywhere. We did alot of walking for exercise, about an hour from downtown to the hotel. Great hotels don't just happen. The reason this hotel is great is because it is managed great. Fotis Tsaganis is a great manager and his employees are fantastic. If you have a problem let them know what it is so they can correct it. They really do want you to have a great stay. The food in the hotel restuarant is a little pricey, but it is sooo good. I had fish tacos every day. I you have never been to Key West you may not know that this little island has some of the best restuarants.

The room came equipped with a small refrigerator, microwave (good for popcorn), coffeemaker and sink. The food was great to have throughout the week for light lunches/picnics and snacks. The hotel does give you a complimentary water every day as well as Starbucks coffee and tea. We had a lunch and a dinner at the hotel which we enjoyed. We were so busy with activities in Key West that we only got a chance to use the pool and hot tub once. Was even able to do some short laps diagonally across the pool.

Do be sure to book your shuttles at the front desk, a day in advance if possible.) This is a full day if you take the boat. The trip includes a brief visit to the fort, breakfast, lunch and time for snorkeling. We snorkeled around the fort and saw a school of fish and 6 barracuda on the side of the fort in shadow. We also took a Sunset Watersports catamaran to a reef near Sand Key Lighthouse for snorkeling. Saw a lot of marine life including a nurse shark. Bonus on the way back was a porpoise show which the boat's captain spotted and stopped for. Went kayaking, checked out the view from La Concha Hotel observatory downtown (free for non-guests after 3PM and you can take an elevator to the top-for those of you who get vertigo climbing the stairs at the lighthouse!), enjoyed swimming and snorkeling at Fort Zachary Taylor State Park and a visit to the Museum of Art and History at the Custom House among other things.

Also, since it was a Sheraton, and being that it was our first time down to the Keys in 20 years, I knew it would be clean and accommodating. Location: While you will need a car, take a cab or the shuttle bus to get to Front and Duval, the location is still very good. Right across from Smathers Beach, makes this a great place if you have kids with you. Smathers is the best beach on Key West, though that does not say much. As far as the beach part, it is really good, but the water is a bit dirty and swimming is not that great, but that is true for all of Key West. Cabs are $4.50 per person door to door anywhere in old town to the hotel. Room: The room was clean and just what I expected from a recently renovated Sheraton. Lobby/Pool: the lobby and pool were really nice, with a restaurant and outside pool. Overall: I found this to be a great place with some character and just what a key west hotel should be. It is not a beach hotel, or a Caribbean style resort. It is a courtyard style place that offers a great rooms and atmosphere for a great price. Key West is not a Beach Resort town and the hotels represent that. I would recommend this Hotel for Families mostly. Couple may want to go to old town and stay in a bed and breakfast. TIP: Get the room rate with the included breakfast for 2...it is a big savings. If you have kids, alternate eating at the hotel and getting a bite at a local place.

The entire staff was friendly and very helpful. The only drawback was having to ride the shuttle to get downtown. We have stayed there before so we knew the shuttle would be a little inconvenient, but this time we had to reserve time to go and return or wait about an hour for the next shuttle at times. The shuttles needed work and the air conditioners either didn't work or were so loud that you could not visit on the ride. I think they should run the shuttles more often so guests could have a better choice of return times to the hotel. They really need to get them fixed as it is quite annoying with all the noise.

(regarding the parade, imagine a smaller version of New Orleans' Mardi Gras celebrations, but with less clothes, more alcohol, and more gay men) The hotel provided a free shuttle to the parade until 2am, a great service that I believe is offered throughout the day all year long. The location of the hotel is great if you desire public beach access, which is situated directly across the street. (tip: if you want to be in the heart of Key West, I suggest another hotel) Beach access and free hotel parking are the two reasons I chose this property. But there were other great aspects of the hotel: 1) As is expected, the rooms are large, and having a microwave and refrigerator are great ways to save money if you want to prepare quick meals. A gift shop with microwaveable meals is available in the lobby. 2) The pool (with a waterfall) and jacuzzi were nice ways to relax. Our server at the poolside cafe was very courteous. 3) Free access to one of the computers and printers in the lobby came in handy when I needed to print my boarding pass or research local attractions. (my hotel is Fort Lauderdale charged $7.99 for 15 minutes!) 4) I needed to wash some clothes (Key West was the last leg of my South Florida vacation) and having access to a washer and dryer was great. 5) The woman who checked me in (Caucasian, dark blonde/light brunette, 20s) was extremely nice throughout our stay as was the night auditor (African American, woman, 20s) who I chatted with while my clothes were washing. The only negatives of our stay were the periodic elevator outages and introverted concierge. Overall, I would highly recommend the Sheraton Suites, especially for families or beach goers.

We really were hoping to go to the Caribbean but could not manage the lengthy flights or cost for a long weekend trip. After doing some research we decided to go to Key West. The Sheraton was a pretty nice place! There are a lot of review stating that they hotel is outdated and dingy. I did not find this to be the case. The lobby area is much more modern and up to date, however I feel the rooms are classic/standard of other Sheraton's I have been to. Very Clean! The common areas were incredibly polished. Pros: Each day around 3:30 or 4:00 the hotel serves this COMPLIMENTARY Sparkling Key Limeade Beverage that will knock your socks off! My husband and I literally would have about 10 glasses each day. Amazing! Lizelle Jacobs is EXTREMELY helpful and she really takes the time to answer your questions and arrange your services. It is most def a bonus to have someone with her knowledge available. We did a Scooter rental that was completely flawless and an absolute blast! The rooms are very spacious. The showers are huge. The toilet has its own room, which was very nice and allows for some extra privacy. We had a lot of room to spread out. We were also able to go grocery shopping and bring food back to our room and had lots of space to store it. Cons: Airport Shuttle is horrible. We arrived in and called for the shuttle at 11:20 AM and were told the next shuttle was at 1:30, really 2 hours for a trip that is a mile away? We ended up taking a cab which was $12 ($6 per person). Very expensive! Very disappointing as we purposely picked a hotel with a shuttle service. I was fuming on arrival, needless to say. Ants! We did go grocery shopping and picked up muffins which we put into a cabinet and the next morning it was infested with ants. Roaches! I saw 2 in the bathroom area over the course of 4 days. Not very comforting but we lived with it. Our room did not get serviced at all 1 day. We did not have a do not disturb sign out either. We waited all day for towels to shower (it didn't really matter because we were just lounging at the pool all day). Eventually around 5PM I called down and asked for towels and advised that we were out of towels and shower supplies, someone eventually surfaced with those items -but still our room was never cleaned. Salt Water Pool was not so fun. My husband and I are dolphins but the whole Salt Water Pool thing bothered both of us. We both had very itchy skin from it and found it less enjoyable then pools as other resorts. Smathers Beach sucks, but we knew that anyway so I cannot complain really. Key West is not for beaches. They are beautiful but you wouldn't go for beaches to swim. Internet access is only free for a little bit and then they shut you off and you have to pay. UGH! Shuttle Service was not very friendly, you have to schedule in advance and it only drops off at one part of Duval. I wish they had a pick up at each end. Tips: The hotels food is extremely expensive. Publix is only a few miles away, if you have a scooter or car go buy groceries! Save $! We also ordered delivery a few times from some local spots like Cuban Coffee Queen, $12 for two people to eat + tip. Half the cost of the hotel food. Rent a scooter, it really gives you freedom to go where you want to go and at your own time. Lots of fun and a very effective way to see the island. The hotels is pretty far from a lot of the hustle and bustle. Certainly not a walk. We purposely stayed away from the party but others like to be in the heart of it.

It is very nicely decorated, the beds are very comfortable, and the kitchen has all the essentials (microwave, mini-fridge, small sink) including Starbucks coffee. Nice pool, nice little restaurant on site, the public beach is right across the street, and you're not far from all the action downtown. There is a free shuttle that will drop you off downtown, you can get a taxi, or you can drive your car and spend a little time looking for a place to park. We did this and it wasn't a big deal. You can't go wrong staying here.", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riverside, CA", "Title": "\u201cBeach Suites\u201d", "Author": "ryanwest", "ReviewID": "UR119331172", "Content": "Sheraton Suites Key West The Sheraton Suites Key West is located on the Atlantic side of Key West right across the street from Smathers Beach. It is one mile from the airport for which they run a shuttle until about 5 PM. If you take a taxi the cost is $6 per person. They also run a shuttle to the other side of the island and leave you off just a short walk from Duval Street. The hotel style is one that fits the Fl keys. It is a bright yellow with a blue trim. Due to its location, it is raised about 10 feet off the ground. When you enter the main building you are looking at the restaurant. To your right is the front desk and the concierge desk. All staff members we dealt with were very friendly and helpful. Our suite was located in the back of the property. Our suite was built in a true suite style, not a converted room with a bar fridge they call a suite. We entered to a tile lined foyer and a dinette set with two chairs and a phone. The living room had a tv, coffee table, and a comfortable sofa. A set of sliding plantation doors separated the living room from the bedroom. We had a king size bed covered in the standard white Sheraton bedding. The bed itself was of reasonable comfort and we each slept well in it. The bathroom was as large as the kitchen/dining room area. Most of the closet space was in the bathroom. The bathroom was well lit with a large mirror and a hair dryer. There was an oversized shower and a water closet. There was no tub. The noise level in our room was a bit higher than we cared for. From our room you could hear the humming of the airplanes approaching and leaving the airport depending on the flight pattern. The humming was not really bad until a 737 approached for landing. Due to the noise, I had to look out to see what was approaching. Each time we opened our door or our neighbors opened their door, the doors that connected the two rooms made an annoying thumping noise. The pool area was a reasonable size and well lined with lounge chairs. There is a jacuzzi behind the waterfalls. The restaurant and bar are nearby and made deliveries to the pool area. They pool staff was attentive and handed out ice pops to guess. There were several large iguanas around the pool that felt the need to check out people who were eating. The people and the iguanas interaction was humorous. There was a major storm just prior to our arrival that flooded the curb lane in front of the hotel. It took several days for the water to go down, which made the walk to the beach a bit difficult.", "Date": "October 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix", "Title": "\u201cYou Cant Go Wrong With Sheraton\u201d", "Author": "dhomer", "ReviewID": "UR119330857", "Content": "Standard Sheraton service is what you find here.

You can access the bathroom from either the bedroom or the livingroom which is nice when there are two couples in the room as what we were doing. We did sleep on the pullout couch in the living room and it was just ok, it coule use refurbishing. The staff here were outstanding.

The suite was clean and spacious. I am not sure I would pay again for the ocean view room, reason being you actually do not get the oceanview / oceanfront / on the beach feel. From the ocean rooms, you look out onto the front hotel parking lot , a bit of landscaping , a four lane road in front of the hotel , a 5 or 6 foot wall seperating the street from the beach, grasses and plantings on top of this wall and then finally the beach and ocean. So the higher the ocean room the better, but we felt removed from the entire beach / ocean. The staff is great and extremely professional. Housekeeping was a little hit or miss. Some days not cleaning our room until we had returned from the days excursions - 4 to 4:30 pm. A bit frustrating. The front desk did explain of a recent staff change and took care of an earlier cleaning time, but even afterward , washcloths were missing and the balcony door was left unlocked one day. The Coral Crab restaurant seemed nice. We only ate breakfast here one time. The pool and bar area also seemed nice. We only went to the bar once. The location is a bit far from town. Key West is small, but you cannot walk downtown to the action of restaurants / bars / shopping. The free shuttle is great , we had no issue reserving the times we wanted. The shuttle drops you off at the Conch Republic restaurant. This is very convenient to all of downtown. Shuttles run on the hour, and the last shuttle leaves downtown at 11:15 pm. A cab ride back to the hotel ( if you decide to stay later ) is about $10.

But the sofa itself was comfy to sit on, and they had another sort of chair with ottoman connected which my 6-yr-old ended up sleeping on just fine. The kids loved the saline pool and it's waterfall! The pool felt more like a hot tub it was so warm, but the hot tub was so hot we didn't want to go in. The outdoor bar seemed popular. The restaurant was hit and miss - we had a great lunch on the outdoor patio one day, but the one night we had dinner at the restaurant, the service was really bad - it took FOREVER to receive our food even though there was only one other table occupied, and when it came, they had my order very wrong - the server was unapologetic and seemed a little spacey like he wasn't quite all \"with it\" maybe. We didn't go back for dinner so not sure if that is normal, but I see other similar reviews of the restaurant so maybe it is. We saw lots of tiny lizards around the property (just like everywhere else in Key West) but never saw one in or near our room. We did have a few small ants on the bar counter in our room which seemed to always be there but nowhere else... we just ignored them and didn't leave any food out, and we coexisted OK. It has obviously not always been a Sheraton and feels that way - a couple of strange design features (open a large cabinet and there is a big pipe running through the space but no shelves). But the location is good and they have a shuttle that can take you into town (if you get a reservation early).

We thought we were getting a deal with the hotel being across from the beach as opposed to staying at the Westin in the heart of old town. We are a family of 5 with children (ages 5-13) and thought that the location would be perfect, since what we wanted to do were mostly outdoor/water activities. Smathers Beach was a bit disappointing. Go to Fort Zach!!!! Anyway, the Sheraton suite/room we stayed in was spacious. The kids actually loved being in the family room more. So actually, we could have gotten a king suite (less expensive) than the double queen suite. lol The kids loved the pool! That was a major PLUS!!! The concierge was nice to book both our sunset snorkeling and parasailing excursions. She was actually nice enough to find a company that would allow our 5 yo to parasail.

It just seemed that our room was NOT being cleaned as well as before (maybe a change in housekeeping personnel - I don't know). It appeared that all they were doing were making the beds and giving us new clean towels. We kind of let it go since we were always in and out of the room. On the last full day we were there, we got back at around 3 pm and our room still had not been cleaned at all. We only went back to get ready to go back out again and enjoy the sunset at Mallory Square one more time. Anyway, we called for service and were told that they would send somebody to clean. We decided to go and enjoy the pool. We came back around 5 pm, and the room was NOT cleaned - beds were made, new towels were there but the floors and who knows what else were not cleaned. THERE WAS A DEAD ROACH ON OUR BATHROOM FLOOR!!!!!!! That was totally unacceptable! Needless to say, they came back to clean and DISINFECT the room. We still made it to our last sunset (barely).

We are SPG members and found the Starwood Preferred service from the front desk personnel poor. The hotel grounds and rooms are very nice and it's in a good location that's a short distance to the center of Key West. They have a free shuttle to and from the center but we only used it once due to a bad 1st experience. A warning if you plan to use the shuttle-- you need reservations for each ride. We were not told this and planned to take it whenever we were ready and wait for the next if necessary. We didn't have a definite idea how long we'd be in the center and wanted to be flexible. While we easily got on one of the morning shuttles without reservations, we had a bad experience when we tried to return. After a busy fun day and great dinner we tried to board a return shuttle later that evening but were told there wasn't room. That was fine, we figured we'd just wait for the next trip, but the driver said we might not be able to get a ride at all that night without reservations. Why were we now informed about the reservation policy and not on our 1st trip? We called the hotel right away to reserve for a later shuttle. The woman was not helpful and didn't seem to care at all. She told us we would have to take our chances the rest of the night and catch a cab if there wasn't room for us. Fortunately we were able to get on the next shuttle..not sure what happened after we called or if it was thanks to the driver or the hotel staff, no one explained, we were just glad that we did get a ride back. We stopped at reception when we got back and were given a very bad attitude by the two women there. We were calm and matter of fact about what happened,but they were annoyed that we stopped by. They were dismissive and reminded us that we did get a ride back afterall. One implied that we should have known we needed reservations and said it was 'common sense'. Not only did she imply that we had no common sense but she was rude for no reason. We were unhappy about the shuttle mishap but willing to chalk it up to miscommunication, but the uncaring, don't bother us attitude and rudeness we received was unforgivable, left a very bad taste and bothered all of us. With such poor attitudes and lack of hospitality skills, these ladies should not be working at the front desk helping guests.

We loved being directly across the street from Smather's Beach, it was wonderful. We ate 2 lunches and a small breakfast(didn't do the buffet) at the hotel restaurant and had a good experience, the staff are friendly and the food was good. We had a few drinks at the bar too one night and had a good experience, Carolyn is a very fun bartender! We did not use room service so I can't speak for that. We didn't bring a computer with us or use the hotels computer, so I don't have a review for that either, it was vacation and I did not even want to look at a computer. The hotel is not too close to the action of Duval Street, but that is PERFECTLY alright! It was very nice to come back to the hotel to relax in our room, or swim at the pool after a busy, hot day on Duval Street shopping, eating, sightseeing, etc. It was very nice to come back to a quiet place to relax. We really loved that aspect of the hotel. Even though it is not super close to all the attractions, we used the hotel shuttle and it was VERY convenient and we did not have one problem getting seats on the shuttle, we'd get our tickets from the front desk and never had an issue no matter what time we needed, it was very convenient. There are 3 shuttle drivers. Randy and Ed are AMAZING!!!! They have great customer service skills and are very nice and very helpful. We looked forward to seeing them each day. Then there was Bill, well, lets just say he has the personality of a cactus!! He wasn't out and out rude to us or anything, he just acts like he just doesn't like his job and acts annoyed that he has to drive people around, he really should not be in a customer service position. But we just brushed it off, not really that big of a deal. Early in the week Randy & Ed announced that if anyone wanted to go to the other end of Duval where the Butterfly thing & the Southernmost Point are, to just stay on the van and they'd take us. But the day we wanted go, it was Bill's day and he said we had to ask. The only downfall to getting dropped off on that end of Duval is having to walk back to the other end, we did and we were fine, it was just extremely hot that day. But there is always the trolley or train option if you want to do that. The pool is very nice and relaxing, we loved it. Our King Suite was perfect for us, the size of the shower is amazing!

I called in advance to find out if they can pick us up from the airport and was told that I need to call when we arrive at the airport. The person I spoke with sounded iffy about it, but when I called upon landing, someone was able to pick us up. It takes less than 5 minutes from the airport so I think it's matter of availability of the shuttle bus. There are 2 guys who run the shuttle and one is a surly, grouch who is quite honestly a pain to deal with. Who wants to look at a sour face especially on vacation? He mainly works during the morning and afternoon. The other guys is very friendly and nice and actually makes conversation with you and says hello. Imagine that! We are Platinum members and they gave us a welcome gift choice of $10 credit or 500 points. They also gave us coupons good for $5 off per person for breakfast which costs $15 per person. We were hoping they would provide free breakfast since that's what Sheratons usually offer, but this was the next best thing. Room is spacious and clean. Ours overlooked the pool. I had brought our iPad, but couldn't get internet to work. There must've been a glitch with the connection, but I didn't bother with it. There's a small refrigerator in the room, so we walked to the nearest grocery store which is 20 minutes away (neighborhood is not that great...nearest stores are a liquor store and a small convenience store), but there are plenty of people that ride their bikes through. We bought some water and snacks there. Hotel's pool is nice and it's a salt water pool. We tried the beach once and didn't go back. It was dirty and murky and full of seaweed. I didn't expect that so it was disappointing, but my daughter's scared of the beach anyway and had a great time at the pool. We went into town a few times and walked around and did some sight seeing. The shuttle runs frequently, but you have to sign up at the front desk and get a ticket to get on. The hotel was overall nice, but I wasn't very impressed with Key West.

The restaurant carries a decent mix of food, and the poolside bar is staffed by friendly, knowledgeable bartenders. Indeed, I enjoyed my stay at the Sheraton. That said, I have a few suggestions: 1) The staff needs a better process to handle incoming guests. My flight arrived in Key West not long after noon, and I was at the hotel by 1 or so, only to learn that my room was not ready. The front-desk clerk said that my room would be ready by 4 p.m. and offered to call me if it was ready earlier. I returned at around 3:30 to find that my room was ready. However, I had not received a call from the staff. Moreover, the hotel did not offer to hold my luggage until the room was ready. These two items are small things, but if Sheraton staff had practiced them, that extra mile would have made a positive impression. 2) The hotel is very close to the beach, which is a plus. However, it's a good couple miles to downtown Key West. The shuttle is available, and I saw bikes available for rental. I eschewed the former, as I brought a rented car, and the latter, as it was 90+ degrees for most of my stay. :Has the Sheraton considered renting the motorized scooters or golf carts I saw everybody tooling around in in Key West? If so, that would be a great service. 3) Room was very clean, and I liked the architectural touches. the clothing-storage cabinets and drawers in the bathroom were a particularly nice touch. That said, the suite's televisions seemed a bit small for the space. I would suggest obtaining televisions that around about 4\" to 6\" larger than they already are. I also noticed that the channel guide provided was incorrect -- two channels were listed as \"HBO Family,\" when one of them was normal HBO.

We ended up in a great King Suite at the corner of a building overlooking the pool from the top floor. I'd like to think my SPG Gold membership got us that room but maybe we were just lucky! The room was gorgeous with lots of living space. The patio overlooking the pool was a perfect place to relax. The pool itself has a large waterfall and a jacuzzi tub. The restaurant was reasonably priced and offered really good options for breakfast - we didn't eat lunch or dinner on property. Beach access is just across the street. There is a kiosk on the beach where you can rent all the beach toys (kayaks, small hobie sailboats, etc.) along with beach chairs and umbrellas. If you're going to be out there for more than a day you should probably buy a chair - the rental (if I remember correctly) were $10 a day. You can buy a chair at local stores for around $15. Same with a beach umbrella. Down the beach a little further on the street was a food vending truck. The nightly Sunset Celebration is a great, free event. But bring some bills for the hard-working entertainers who provide the fun. We also really enjoyed Truman's Little White House.", "Date": "March 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mpls,MN", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Mplstraveler", "ReviewID": "UR98563604", "Content": "The rooms at this hotel are just about perfect.

Why are they skimping? The fire alarm went off at 10pm one night right after we had climbed the stairs to go to bed, so we climbed back down to the parking lot to wait. It was very loud, our child was scared. There was no fire, so either the hotel's system malfunctioned, or someone pulled the alarm.

I found that the rates were actually the same so I wished I had known better and booked directly from the hotel. There was some mixup initially as I had paid extra on Priceline for a room with a kindbed and ocean view, but apparently the hotel said that these 3rd party sites had no right to sell this. So they initially upgraded me under the Starwood program, only to then rectify that I had paid extra so got me a better room later. Fortunately, thanks to the initiative of Mr Ireland, who truly welcomed me and since I was also a Starwood Preferred member, was able to rectify the situation and gave me a good room. I was disappointed at first as the first floor ocean view room overlooks the road, and at street level is noisy and there is little privacy. Between him and Mr Fortis Tagliana, they changed me to a 3rd floor room for a few days of my stay so I could get a great view of the ocean above the tree level. I saw from my room the best sunrise and subset, and it was very relaxing indeed. The hotel offers shuttle services to downtown although these get booked up quickly. The restaurant downstairs is horrible---service is slow and food is average. Forget thus about ordering room service as the same waiters seem to offer room service and serve in the restaurant. Concierge desk is helpful but I suggest you do your own homework to substantiate before signing on. I had a 50:50 chance of a good trip she recommended. Having said that, the Sheraton overlooks the best beach in Key West and I hugely recommend it from that front. The rooms are very spacious and well laid out. Very clean and nice new fixtures. So eat out, and if you dont have to deal with bad service (almost rude--one waitress was even a little rude)=and ask for Mr Ireland and Fortis to make your stay a pleasant one---most of all, join the Starwood Preferred member and order your room direct from the hotel.

This was one I rather disliked. Perhaps it's because we feel claustrophobic in a hotel with internal corridors and no balconies. My wife uses a wheelchair, so we had booked a room with a modified bathroom. Reception was at first floor level (the term used in the British English way) and there were steps up to it from the car park. There was a lift, though its grotty entrance made it feel like a service lift. There was a chiliness to the whole reception process - no people-friendly service here. Our room was a couple of floors up, and we had to cross a bridge with self-closing doors at either end - not easy with a wheelchair. The suite was large and very comfortable, and with a particularly good bathroom. But - bearing in my mind this was an \"accessible\" bathroom - if you pulled the sliding bathroom door fully across there was no way of opening it from the inside except by putting your finger on the top of the door and sliding it back - so a lone wheelchair traveller would have been imprisoned. The courtyard area is pleasant, but as in many American hotels we smokers were made to feel like lepers. The pool area was good, but there were people erecting what looked like a stage, so in addition to the usual noise around a pool there was the din from carpenters and their power tools.

The location is ok - it's right across from the beach, however to get to Duval and downtown, you gotta take the hotel shuttle or a cab. Plan ahead if you want to use the shuttle. You just need to go into the lobby the day you want to use the shuttle, get tickets and be on time. We did this to get down there but used a cab to get back. I think next time we will stay closer to Duval since we spent a lot of time there. The restaurant in the hotel is pretty boring. Breakfast was great, lunch and dinner was blah. The guest services is nice but be prepared to spend about 10 minutes there while the girl goes through her prepared speech on restaurants.

We had chosen a buffet style dinner and everybody raved about how great all of the food was. My dad said that he thought the beef was the best he had ever had. The buffet also included Key Lime Pie and chocolate cake. People kept telling me how great the Key Lime pie was and I never heard a word about how good the special wedding cake was that we ordered. We had also eaten some breakfasts as well as a lunch or two at the hotel. And all of the food was great! Our room was very large and very nice!

We had an ocean view room and it was great getting up in the morning and looking out the window at the beautiful Smathers Beach. We slept great! The beds were very comfy. Our room was cleaned every day and the staff was all very nice and accomodating. I really enjoyed the coffee/tea maker in the rooms! We really loved the location. It was so nice to have access to a great swimming pool at the hotel as well as having the beach right across the street.

However, here are some tips if you are going to stay there. Get up in the morning and sign up for the shuttle. Even for the shuttle at night. There were a couple of days we didn't know what we were doing at night so we waited to sign up. When we tried to sign up later in the afternoon, all the shuttles were booked. So either we went in really late, or really early or needed to pay for a taxi in. Also, be on time for the shuttle. They will leave on the dot. You would think they would get more shuttle times or shuttles if there are people wanting to leave but I think this happened only on one day. So just sign up early for the shuttles you need the entire day. Also, you MUST sign up for the airport shuttle. You must. I don't care what the person behind the counter says. We came up to leave for the shuttle only to be told that it was booked. The guy behind the counter gave us this sorry for you look. I told him that I got up at 7am to book my shuttle for that day and was told I could just come whenever for the shuttle. Thankfully, they got the bigger van and we got to the airport. Some minor things. Bring your own shampoo. I didn't want to bring my own since I didn't want to hassle with airport security stuff and I figured the hotel would one suffice for a couple of days. I understand it's not the greatest stuff, but the hotel shampoo did not do anything. It barely cleaned my hair. It was so greasy and gross after a few days. I could have bought my own there but by the time I realized how greasy my hair was since the shampoo wasn't working, I just sucked it up. The wireless internet they're supposed to have did not work in our room. It may work well in other areas, but it barely worked in ours. We needed to call in for a conference call but could not. We called in several times but it never got fixed adequately. There are computers available for internet usage by the main lobby. However, when we were there, at certain parts of the day, there are kids on it checking facebook or playing games. I waited and waited and they did not get off. There should be some kind of enforced policy. The concierge is very nice but she talks too much. Sometimes we waited forever to finally talk to her. Some of the people at the front desk were a bit rude and put offish. The drivers are all very nice. Make sure you bring lots of $1 bills to pay for tipping each time you take the shuttle rides. I would not recommend this hotel because of some of the minor things. I would have rather paid just a bit more to make sure we got internet access and better transportation.", "Date": "August 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Marietta, New York", "Title": "\u201cVery Spacious, and Relaxing Hotel\u201d", "Author": "KRyor", "ReviewID": "UR73468767", "Content": "We used the shuttle service from the airport upon arriving to Key West.

Mr. Ed should be put in charge of the hotel.\u201d", "Author": "tutorturtle", "ReviewID": "UR67096803", "Content": "We were booked at this hotel as part of an American Airlines vacation package. I have a feeling that is the only way this hotel gets most of its customers. Generally the hotel was safe and clean, but there were many *little* things that everyone should know about. Some of these were written in past reviews of this hotel and I'm surprised that none of them have been addressed since 2008. Here are the basic ones that I think everyone might want to know about: * The hotel is not near Duval street and is not walkable by most people. It *is* very close to the airport, but there is no way you can walk from the airport to this hotel. * The hotel *is* across the street from Smathers Beach. It is a public beach and very small since it is man-made. It is groomed every morning, but there is a ton of seaweed there no matter when you go. The only shade is from a few palm trees. Bring a towel...chairs are $10 a day. * The main entrance to the hotel is set up so that you have to climb a flight of outside stairs. While I can walk easily, I found this really annoying after walking through downtown Key West for hours. I saw children and senior struggling while dealing with these stairs. What was the hotel thinking? * If you want a shuttle from the airport to the Sheraton, call and book it before your flight arrives. Get the name of the person that made the reservation and the driver for your records. Although we confirmed that there was an airport shuttle before we left, we were told that none were available when we arrived at Key West International Airport. We ended up taking a taxi which cost $15 ----for less than a few miles. You can go from one end of Chicago to the other for $15. We did get a shuttle to the airport when we left, but only after arguing the point with the front desk staff at the time. * As others have mentioned, there is a shuttle to/from downtown Key West. Actually, it leaves you at a pickup point used by DoubleTree, Marriott, and Sheraton at a restaurant called the Conch Republic. Pickup and drop-off times are strict --- follow the rules or you will regret it. You can only reserve a shuttle seat by going down to the front desk *on the same day* and specifying which times you will leave and return. Really. And that leads me to my next point... * The hotel front desk staff reminded me of Senfeld's \"Soup Nazi.\" If you don't follow the rules at the front desk, you will regret it. With a few exceptions, most of them are surly and do not want to help you. They truly seemed to be annoyed by anyone that comes up to the front desk. I personally saw several of them \"bully\" customers so that they would just go away. They do not smile; they do not greet you. They do not want to help you. You are interrupting their chit-chat which never stops. After traveling for many years, I can honestly say this is the worst front desk I have ever dealt with on any trip. Note to Starwood: Re-assign them or re-train them. * Pavla (that's the way she spells it) can not possibly be an employee of the hotel, even though she is the concierge. She doesn't have anything to do with the operation of the hotel and only points you to the front desk, if you ask about anything other than restaurants or boat trips. She certainly is nice enough and willing to help, if she can make a dollar or two doing it. When she is not at her station next to the front desk, her replacements are basically zombies that mirror the rest of the front desk staff. * My wife and I laughed a good bit when we saw the earlier comment about not even the towel guy being happy. We saw several of them during our stay and none of them were happy. Again, they do not smile: they do not greet you. The only hotel staff that were nice enough to say \"hello\" were the cleaning people and groundskeepers. Which reminds me about the pool... * The pool was like bath water whenever it was open. And it was a little slimey and salty for some reason. No hint of chlorine or other normal pool chemicals. * As many others have mentioned this is a suite-hotel and not a resort. Don't expect anything more than what you would find at your average hotel. * Make sure that you obey the many warning signs that are found wherever you find yourself at this hotel. BTW, in keeping with the spirit of the front desk, none of the signs contain the words \"please,\" \"thank you\", or anything remotely similar. Also, none of the signs were in Spanish or any other language. Very few had icons to make them clear to people that did not speak English. Despite all of these signs, we had to ask directions to the ice machines. * The description of the hotel's restaurant is laughable. It is primarily used as a breakfast buffet in the morning ($15 a head). The rest of the day it is used primarily as a quick order grill with indoor and outdoor seating. Don't plan on having any nice dinners here. * You can eat in your room, of course, but as others have mentioned, there really is not a kitchen to speak of in the room. We had a microwave, a small sink (with a constantly dripping faucet), and min-fridge, and a coffeemaker. It was OK for us, but a small family might want more. * If you plan on eating on your room and saving some money, plan ahead. Unless you have your own transportation and can go to the new side of the island, you will need to get groceries on Duval Street. There are several small groceries, but the CVS and Walgreen's are your best best. Remember, you will have to carry back to the shuttle point and then on the shuttle home. * We did not know that this was dog friendly hotel until after we got home and read other reviews on TripAdvisor. We probably would not have stayed there if we had known that. And if you have read this far, you must be wondering who Mr Ed is. He is the nicest and most hospitable person we met on the entire island of Key West. He understands why people are there and tries to help at every turn. He gave us tips for places to check out and places to avoid. You might think he was the hotel manager or other person of authority. Nope. He drove the Sheraton shuttle back and forth from downtown Key West. As others have mentioned below, he was Sheraton Keys Hotel to us. The only fond memories of the Sheraton Key West were going back and forth in the shuttle talking with Mr. Ed. I will bet some other hotel hires him away from the Sheraton Key West. In closing, my wife and I were amazed at how accurate most of the TripAdvisor reviews are and will consult them without fail for future trips. I hope the comments above help others that are thinking of staying at the hotel. Starwood's Sheraton Key West management certainly is not reading them.

Steven Flint was also a mean man. His job was driving the shuttles. He drove us to Duval street a couple nights, all of which we gave him a good tip.

Housekeeping brought us extra towels whenever we needed them. The concierge, Pavla, was so sweet and helpful. The Bad:Location; the hotel was right in front of Smathers Beach which is a couple of miles away from the action of Duval Street. The hotel boasts a free shuttle to down town but we weren't successful in getting on it once during our 4 day stay. You have to make a reservation, in person and there are very limited seats. Also, it only runs once per hour. The staff was pretty unenthusiastic about assisting us with cabs. We spent a lot of time waiting outside the hotel waiting for a cab \"they called\" to come. It never came. We called our own from then out and they were there a LOT faster. If you plan on spending time on the man made beach, the location is great. We laid out by the pool but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t end up visiting the beach so the result was a lot of money wasted on cab rides. The pool is okay. There is a bar but no cocktail servers or music. The pool boy didn't seem happy to be there. The Ugly: The staff at this hotel (with the exception of Pavla, the concierge) was AWFUL! The front desk staff never smiled and seemed to be annoyed any time you walked up. One of them even snapped at me upon picking up my bags from storage. I shared that my bag didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come out and she snapped back saying they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t done setting them out. Sorry I asked. At first I thought maybe the dismay was just toward us, a group of 13 and potentially overwhelming girls but then I witnessed the rudeness occur to other guests and realized they evenly distribute the love. Even the pool towel boy was miserable. There was one semi-friendly girl at the front desk but I was too distracted by her lip ring, long acrylic nails and glittery hair clip to notice. Sheraton is a part of Starwood Hotels. I always stay at Starwoods if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re available and up to this point, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d never disappointed.

The staff must have assumed that we were all spring breakers. I figured people in their 30's wouldn't be mistaken for spring breakers... but the staff here apparently doesn't care too much. If the wedding bands on our hands wasn't a clue... the 7-month pregnant woman may have been a good tip that we were indeed not spring breakers. They have hired a few weekend GI Joes that come complete with Laura Croft style leg holstered tasers the harass you every time you return to the hotel ground.

It is basically like crossing a military checkpoint in the middle east (not enjoyable on vacation). When we stepped out of a cab upon returning from the wedding reception one of these \"hotel greeters\" immediately lost his mind on us. We hadn't said a word or done a thing, which apparently prompted this person to fly into a rage. After we told him to chill out his head pretty much exploded. He was extremely out of line and had no business addressing anyone in the manner that he did. Out of spite he followed one member of our party to his room then called the police to throw him and his girlfriend off their property, hours later at about 3am.

If this were my hotel I would get Mr. Ed to give the entire staff a lesson on hospitality and tourism management. He was helpful courteous and provided great local information.

As a party of three, a suite was a very good option for us, meaning we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to book 2 rooms, but still getting a wee bit of privacy. Away from down town Key West, and opposite a quiet sandy beach, this hotel is really easy to get to from Highway 1. The hotel has a pleasing Colonial/Caribbean style exterior with wood painted in cool shades and lots of palm trees. The reception area has been finished to a very good standard, modern but calming. The restaurant and internet area has a similar finish. Reception staff were professional, if a little distant; the Concierge on the other hand was very helpful with plenty of suggestions on where to eat. Pictures on the internet seem to show that the rooms were renovated fairly recently. Although an improvement on the previous (somewhat garish?!) d\u00c3\u00a9cor, the reality is that they already look a bit worn and in need of further renovation/updating. Having said that, they were comfortable and clean. The bedroom was well furnished, with a fairly neutral d\u00c3\u00a9cor. The living room had a large L shaped sofa bed (which was a little stained) a dining table, and a wet bar area with sink, microwave, fridge and coffee/tea maker with lovely velvety Starbucks coffee! The bathroom was quite small, but clean, with good shower pressure and a plentiful supply of hot water. There was also a dressing room/antichambre with sink, storage space, and a useful safe in the cupboard. Both the bedroom and living room had flat screen TVs with a wide selection of channels. However, the remote from the bedroom TV changed the one in the living room which became annoying! Wireless internet here was free, and of a decent speed. Although the hotel is very close to Key West airport, the noise of the landing aircraft (mainly turboprops) wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t an issue. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very useful shuttle service to down town Key West, with a fixed timetable and limited spaces, but saves the mission of find a parking space. This has to be booked at Reception, but it is free, reliable and taxis certainly aren't cheap! (Also quite a unique experience \u00e2\u20ac\u201c friendly driver with a quirky personality and a fabulous soundtrack playing on the stereo!). Down town Key West has a many great places to eat (highly recommend El Meson de Pepe Cuban Restaurant!) and plethora of bars and clubs for everyone (certainly lots of sights not for the faint hearted!) Breakfast wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t included in our rate, and we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat at the hotel. We also arrived later in the afternoon, and so unfortunately didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get to take a dip in the pool. All in all, a decent choice for our whistle-stop visit to Key West given the price paid. However, the next time I visit, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d chose to stay in one of the smaller, more charming boutique hotels closer to the southernmost point for a more authentic Florida Keys experience.", "Date": "March 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario, Canada", "Title": "\u201cExtremely comfortable & conceriege outstanding\u201d", "Author": "teemurphy", "ReviewID": "UR57985167", "Content": "Room was spacious, clean and lots of storage for 2 adults and 16 & 17 year olds.

Our room did not have a balcony ,which was a big disappointment. To me, a fun in the sun vacation is not complete without a balcony, even if there is no special view. Service was inconsistent - the concierge, Petie, goes out of her way to please, but the check-in staff is not particularly friendly or knowlegeable. I overheard a few arguments while waiting in line. Staff seems a little put out to write up shuttle tickets or hand out pool towels (very strange to have front desk staff do this, but the pool desk was not staffed 90% of the time) the shuttle drivers were pleasant, esp the one working on christmas. Housekeeping was erratic, coming at all times and some times doing bare minimum. Restaurant/bar staff was pleasant and efficient. Location. Well, the hotel is across from the Smathers public beach, but it wasnt particularly populated, perhaps because many people, myself included, dont want to pay $10/rental chair. the hotel is not walking distance to Duval street, so the complimentary shuttle is a bonus. Be advised to book early that day or you will be SOL. If you want to try other areas or restaurants not on Duval, you'll have to take a cab which is a minimum of $16 each way (most drivers do not accept credit cards). A car is truly waste if you will only use it to go to dinner a few times. There is really not much else near the hotel that is walkable. Overall, you do get what you pay for at Sheraton suites - it is clean, has a nice pool and a good concierge. The restaurant food is decent, but like all hotels, expensive.

We have stayed at this Sheraton several times over the years and we keep coming back because the suite format gives us lots of space for the price of a regular room. It has always been comfortable, but since the property received a complete face lift, the rooms are as nice as any within the Sheraton Suites brand and would certainly fall into the high end of 3 stars or even the low end of 4 stars in another market. The new furnishings are Sheraton Standard, and there is the large well lit table/desk to provide a comfortable place to work, and of course there is the truly heavenly, \"Heavenly Bed\" for which Starwood is so well known. Yes I said Heavenly Bed and not Sweet Sleeper, because the bed linens are more Westin than Sheraton. The towels however were more in line with the Sheraton brand. The voice mail system is a little quirky, but since we were on a leisure trip, it really didn't matter. Internet was provided for free, but I needed to fire up my external Engenius Wifi card to get a decent signal. Once connected however the free Wifi was fine for surfing and e-mail. The location on Smathers Beach makes it a little remote, but the hotel provides a free shuttle to get into the heart of the Duval strip. Otherwise it is a long walk or an ~$10 cab ride to get to anyplace for dinner, unless of course you dine in the predictably average in house restaurant. The remoteness however is also an advantage because during the busy times of the year in Key West, such as the annual Fantasy Fest this weekend, the activity tends to concentrate on Duval, so the hotel can become an Oasis of quiet. I was offered an upgrade as a Starwood Platinum and given an \"Ocean View\" room. While it was true that I could see the ocean from my room, I also had a pretty good view of the parking lot and of US Route 1a which separated the hotel from the beach. Since there is a fair amount of traffic on Route 1a during the day, the view does not make up for the noticeable road noise that gets past the only double glazed windows and balcony doors. My recommendation if one is offered an upgrade, is to request south facing rooms overlooking the hot tub area of the pool on the 200 or 300 level. We will definitely recommend this property to others and will stay here again ourselves, the next time our travels takes us to Key West.

The bathroom was nice- there was a quite large closet area with granite counter top sink and separate shower/toilet area. There were only a few negatives about the hotel. One is that we went while the hotel was undergoing renovation so the lobby area was in a weird, hard to reach area. Another was the location. While this is right across the street from the beach, it was a drive from the city center. We drove so we had a car but parking downtown is very limited and can be pricey. We actually did walk back to the hotel after a long day/night of drinking but by the time we got back to the hotel we had all lost our buzz and decided we wouldn't try it again. The beach across the street is not that appealing either. It's nice and large but the water was kind of gross and warm. We did enjoy watching fireworks from the beach on July 4th.

We called Guest Services and within 30 minutes the housecleaner was at our door, so while they were very slow in getting the job done, it did get done quickly once we contacted Guest Services. The shuttle was great, you just have to make sure that you sign up early each day for each shuttle that you need to get where you want to go each day.

Lastly, we used the Key West Express to get to/from Key West. It was also a great trip, the only problem is the return on Sunday was packed with a lot of people that were hung-over and the waves were a little choppy, so if you come to Key West this way, get to the boat terminal early for check-in so you can select a good seat! Also, we found a great \"luggage hotel\" kitty-corner from the boat terminal, for $10 per person (2 bags each), they can hold your luggage until you go to check-in @ Key West Express. One of the owners, J.R. Fogarty also runs a cab, he was very helpful to us since we didn't know our way around the island and took us to a great sandwich shop (Paradise) for our cuban sandwiches...that too, was awesome...the sandwiches were HUGE! The hotels make you check out by 10:00, 11:00 a.m. and the boat doesn't leave until 6:00 p.m., so rather than leave your luggage at the hotel and then have to come back and pick them up, you can leave your luggage right by the terminal and spend those hours getting in your last \"shopping\" experiences or whatever.

The rooms were very spacious, clean, and updated. The Sheraton is in the midst of renovation, but this barely affected our stay.

The water was clean and warm and it had a nice waterfall. The hotel is just across the road from Smather's Beach, which was nice.

Luckily a manager walking past led us to the new location of the front desk, a transformed conference room down the hall. She was very apologetic telling us that the front desk was being moved so that renovation could begin. We wouldn't have cared about the construction, we just would have liked a heads up before we came. The hotels website made no mention of any work being done nor did our confirmation. None the less we were greeted every mourning at 7:30 by the sound of construction equipment dumping trash into the dumpsters behind our room. It's really good that they are renovating, our room alone had several minor problems: toilet paper holder coming out of the wall, mini fridge stopped working, and stains on the carpet. Also we thought the price of the breakfast buffet for $15.95 was far over priced for the selection of food and quality that was offered, but I guess you can check this up to it's Key West.

The location of the hotel was about a five to ten minute drive from Mallory Square. The hotel provides a shuttle bus into town. I don't know any specifics about the shuttle because we rented a car. If you rent a car parking in town can be a nuisance and become expensive, but allows you to see a lot more of Key West and the other Keys. We flew into Miami, so we made the approximately three and a half hour drive down. I have always liked the drive from Miami, so I usually opt to take the drive. There is plenty to look at along the way and the time goes by very quickly. My fianc\u00c3\u00a9 and I booked this trip for our wedding / honeymoon. We booked all of our wedding stuff over the internet before we got there. We got married on Smathers Beach on Tuesday the 20th. With the location to Smathers Beach and being a Starwood resort, we chose the Sheraton. The only real complaint I have about the hotel is the fact that most rooms don't have balconies. Being a Starwood resort owner and a gold member, I requested an ocean front room with a balcony. When we got there at 5:30pm they said they had no more ocean front rooms with a balcony. I was tired from traveling, so rather than argue I just choose another room. Check-in went smoothly and within 15 mins of our arrival we were in our room. Not an ocean front or balcony room, but close enough. It was room 361, which is the third floor right side room closest to the front of the hotel. We had a decent view of the ocean from the hallway balcony. The room was large and open. There is a separate bedroom with sliding doors to close it off. We never used the doors, since it was just the two of us, but I can imagine it would be nice if there was someone sleeping on the pullout couch. There is a small wet bar with a coffee maker, microwave, frig, sink and storage. The only problem with the wet bar is there are no plates or silverware. We made a call to room service and they provided what we needed. Room service was very quick and delivered decent food. We ordered breakfast twice and dinner twice, and all was good and at our room within 25 mins at the most. The bath room is large with plenty of storage. A few things we did during our stay that I would recommend to others: We took the \"Fast Cat\" to the Dry Tortugas. This is a most do! It is about a two and a half hour boat ride to Fort Jefferson. There is excellent snorkeling, nice beaches and a HUGE fort to explorer. Mallory Square at sunset is always a must. The performers are very entertaining, and the sunset is almost always perfect. We also did a back country kayak tour. For this we had to travel to mile marker 17 on sugarloaf key. Capt Andrea took us, and it was amazing. I highly recommend this to everyone, as this was the best part of my trip. We also went flats fishing. Once again we did this from the sugarloaf marina with Capt Justin and Sting Rea Charters. We had a great time and caught plenty of fish. Another must do is taking a trip up to Bahia Honda state park. The beaches are picture perfect and you can find many unique shells. In order to do this you will need a rental car. If you get a rental car from Miami or Ft Lauderdale and drive down, you will see a lot of things you'll want to check out during you stay. If any of you are interested in jewelry I highly recommend David Brian Jewelers on Duval St. I made a couple purchases from him while in town. The catch for me was if you make a purchase he will take you on a sunset cruise and a fishing trip. He has a 50 foot boat and is not only a jeweler, but a Capt. too. I didn't get to take a fishing trip while in town, because of the weather and schedule, so he said next time I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m in town he'll take us out. Most of the activities mentioned above can be found on the Key West website. Our favorite restaurants in Key West are: Laid back: Rum Barrel Nice: A&B Lobster House and Commodores Our favorite restaurant from our entire trip is the Square Grouper. This isn't on Key West, and is about a 25 min drive from down town. It is on Cudjoe Key at mile marker 22.5 Back to the hotel... All in all we had a very nice stay. I don't have any real complaints about anything. The hotel is nice, and simply that. It is not over the top fancy by any means, but offers a nice location out of the hustle bustle of town. If you are looking for a five star resort, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a nice laid back place to stay than this is it.

We were disappointed continuously throughout our stay. Immediately upon walking into the room we noticed how dated and worn the room appeared. Certainly, the quality of the room is far below standards expected of a Starwood Hotel. Upon further inspection, we were exceptionally appalled to find a white substance very evident on the blue bedspread and then upon using the restroom noticed a brown substance spread over the walls. We called the front desk to complain at which time the general manager was not at all helpful and informed us more or less to deal with it because they were sold out. They did however offer us one other room...a room that was currently being painted, and consequently had paint chips all over the floor and some sort of fan running to try to clear out the very evident smell - obviously, not acceptable. Our only option was to have them try to clean the walls and change the bedspread - as such, we went for a walk and upon our return 2 HOURS LATER, nothing had been addressed yet. This was just the beginning. Throughout our stay, we found the cleaning service to be subpar - not replacing towels, or water, and the customer service to be more or less indifferent. The real kicker was when we went to use a \"clean\" towel only to notice the dried blood on the towel. We couldn't stand being in this room and it definitely put a damper on what was supposed to be a romantic vacation as we didn't want to touch each other due to the concern of the germs that we may have picked up in the room. Oh, one other small note - in a country that is focused on \"being green\" I also find it very disappointing to return to a room in which the cleaning service has left both TVs on and multiple lights on throughout the day. A very unnecessary waste. It was very evident that nobody was checking the performance of ANY of the employees and there had been very little, if any, training.

The shuttle is a great way to go down and back at night. We would use our rental car to drive down during the day. Get back. relax alittle, catch the 5:30 and come back at 10:50, or, take a cab..

As usual, Trip advisor helps a lot to finally decide, based on all the recent reviews. Pros: a) Building: Very nice hotel, Caribbean style, well structured with huge rooms, b) Location: If you want to stay away of Duval Street, al least at sleeping time, this is your hotel. Despite being close to the airport, we didn't hear anything and c) the pool: Quite big, excellent water temperature, good atmosphere and a pool bar that really works. Cons: a) Smathers Beach: One of the reasons why we chose this hotel was its proximity to the \"... unique real beach in Key West..\" Unfortunately, I can say it's one of the worst beaches I've ever stayed. Bad smell, seaweeds stuffed and the tiny areas of sand were like shifting sands. In one word: Horrible. We stayed the whole day in the pool, b) Front Desk: Thanks to other reviews, I've noticed I'm not the only one to percieve a certain rudeness in many of the Front Desk officers, including its Head. In my personal experience, I had a minor incident with her, due to the fact I was awaiting my laundry bag in my room (available at 18,00 h.). At 21,00 h. I went down and realized that it was still there in reception. When I asked her if she had checked that all the laundry was there, she answered me that it was my duty to check that ??? Well, I think we can all have bad days, can't we ? and c) Breakfast is OK. Small buffet but good quality. The problem comes with the famous \"vouchers\" for 2 people. What is the real sense for this ? One of our friends' family had a problem with them, as one of the members of the family had breakfast before the other 3 and \"forgot\" to inform the waitress about this fact. Later on, they had problems in the check-out as the hotel tried to charge an extra breakfast. The simpler, the easier.

The kitchenette allowed us to keep enough staples, so we weren't nickled and dimed by snacks and drinks.

The Sheraton is located far from downtown, so this may be a positive or negative depending on the kind of vacation you are looking for. We give this hotel a moderate rating for the following reasons: 1. Housekeeping was sporadic at best. We would frequently see room service trays and other service items left in our hallway for more than 24 hours. It may sound like a nit pick, but the provided bath products were of a low quality. 2. There is one tiny \u00e2\u20ac\u0153closet\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd inside the sink area to hang up your clothes. Given the size of the room, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pretty small space.

Reservations for the desirable times are often unavailable as there are usually only 16 seats available for the shuttle. 4. The business center consists of two terminals and printers located at the end of the bar in the hotel restaurant. The internet is free, but often there was always a wait to use them.

The printers were also free, but had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Out of Order\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd signs posted on them from our second night forward and were still broken when we departed 6 days later (so much for printing out our boarding passes). 5. If you are fishing in Key West and are looking forward to the restaurant preparing your catch (a very common thing in Key West), do not even think of asking the over-priced and always-empty hotel restaurant. 6.

Now I can say there isn't anywhere else I'd call home besides Sheraton Suites. First great feature...Location. Directly across from Smathers Beach, all you need to do is walk across the parking lot and there you are! Great spot! The building itself is charming, with yellow siding, white trim, and blue shutters. Building definitely reflects Key West's personality. Great feature is that the halls are only one room deep...We had an end unit, which meant we only shared one wall with another suite. Great for Privacy. Interior hallways are nice too, with elevator options through the lobby or directly from the parking lot. Hotel offers a great shuttle service, running throughout day and night, which is super convenient. Lobby and grounds were clean and very well kept. Nice landscaping, great dog walking area, shady, grassy, great. Entire place felt very small, in the good way. Pool area was clean and not at all crowded. Plenty of chairs and towel service, as well as $2/min massage available poolside. Pool bar and full service restaurant with Happy Hour. Pool had a beautiful waterfall and was lit up gorgeous at night. Secluded, although small, spa area. Too many bugs in water to enjoy though. Dottie in Concierge was very helpful, although kinda crazy. We booked a snorkel trip with Floridays and had a Great time, despite rocky waters. Room was a suite with two doubles. Many fantastic features. Granite and cherry wood throughout kitchenette and baths. Separate living room area with sectional pull out couch, plantation shutters, living room television. Private sleep area behind sliding wooden doors, with poolside view. We had four adults and a dog staying, so it was great to have privacy between the areas. Another nice feature was the bathroom setup. Private bathroom with toilet and shower, opens into roomy area with sink and California closets. You could totally close this off from either the bedroom or the living area, which was great. Also, it meant the girls could get ready while the guys showered,with plenty of privacy for everyone. A few complaints...We stayed in a pet friendly room, and there were obviously two old urine stains on carpet that they Definitely hadn't been even attempted to clean. A little more attention to detail would have been nice...a few scuff marks on walls, just a couple items that could have been addressed to make the place Spectacular. But all in all, we could NOT have been more pleased. The whole place was bright, cheerful, true to Key West, reasonably priced, great location, clean, Super helpful and friendly staff, housekeeping pleasant...No real complaints at all.

Bathroom was very large with fully tiled shower big enough for two. Only two things that need repair in the bath...the porcelain handle on the toilet was cracked when we arrived and by the time we left it had broken off. Also the floor outside the shower was always wet as the grout under the frame was gone. We will let the hotel know about this. Large balcony overlooked the ocean, had 2 comfortable chairs and a small cocktail table. The coffee maker was the worst I have ever seen in a hotel. It was a one-cup model that you put premeasured pouches in. Altho it was Starbucks coffee that was provided free of charge, the coffee was too weak and tasted terrible. Maid service was fine but they only came in 2 times in the 5 days we were there. We left the room for 3 hours and came back and still nobody had come. We asked them for some towels and put the trash out in the hallway for pickup. The pool was very nice with a 6 foot deep end. Not very safe for small children as it had no baby pool, the hot tub was great. Plenty of towels poolside. Very nice bar area overlooking the pool with afternoon live entertainment daily. Laundry room was a hike but close to the pool so we went there while the clothes were washing. $2.00 for wash, $2.00 for 45 min. dry time. We ate at the breakfast buffet twice, some said it was pricey but for $15/pp you can eat your big breakfast and still be full and skip lunch so to us it was a good deal.

My one concern when I booked this hotel was whether it's location in a quiet area several miles from Duval St. and Mallory Square would be a problem since we did not rent a car, but it really was not. We took the shuttle in (we only had to stand one time). We generally took taxis back to the hotel or when we went to the wonderful Louie's Backyard.

The room was nice and big, updated inside however on the outside the hotel was lacking. Seemed a bit rundown. The pool area was a lot smaller than it seemed in the hotel photos online. The hot tub was broke for about three out of our five day trip. Best thing was the conceriege. She was great! Was very knowledgeable about all the excursions. Across from the hotel was a public beach....beware it is 30.00 for two chaises and a umbrella. Sandy area is small and no waves, however beach was quiet and relaxing, we enjoyed it. We did the Ultimate Adventure boating, which included snorkling, jet skiing, water trampoling, parasailing. It costs around 600.00 for a family of five and included breakfast and lunch. At reservations they were not very organized and we were sent to 2 different locations before we could check in for our trip. They couldn't find our reservation, so they had to re enter it which took a while. Even though I had a receipt which included a deposit. Duval street is probably great if you are there to party but with three kids in tow we didn't get much out of it. We ate at The Grande @ Key West which was very upscale but the staff seemed very snobby. Cheesburgers in Paradise was horrible, don't bother wasting your money, There was also a seafood buffett that we ate at on Duval not great. We did eat at one Italian restaurant of off Duval which was great! Best meal while we were their. All in all, I don't think Key West is geared towards families more for singles, couples.

The coffee maker brews one cup at a time, and you get three packets of coffee each day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 2 regular and 1 decaf. There are not a lot of breakfast options. The first day we bought coffee from the coffee bar \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we wanted some sort of breakfast pastry too, but there didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be any available \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any, and the person who poured our coffee for us was also waiting on tables in the restaurant, so he was pretty busy.

There is a safe in the bathroom. The bathroom products are of good quality, and our housekeeper left two bottles of everything for us to ensure that we would not run out. There is a door tag that you can fill out to select the time the housekeeping staff cleans your room. Unfortunately we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see this until the day we were checking out.

The Sheraton does provide a free shuttle service to Mallory Square, but is only runs once an hour and was too full to get on several times during our stay. We'd recommend the hotel run this service each half hour instead of each hour. An airport shuttle service would also be helpful, as it was $15 (including tip) each way for a very short taxi ride. Another disappointment in the shuttle service is that it only runs from 10-10 so any early morning tours or nightlife require a cab.

The other hotels closer to Duval are nice as well (Hyatt, Ocean Key Resort, Southernmost Resort...all good options).

We were hesitant about first floor and pool and potential racket, but miss concierge assured us that we would like our room so we took it. Walking around the hotel to our room we found the outside looked weathered, but what do you expect in a sunny, salty air? We approached the room, opened the door with hesitation and from here on, out goes the first impression... Inside was a large suite met with marble-like floor. A beautifully updated bathroom (large at that). Around the corner a kings size bed with flat screen tv. Turn the corner again and a large comfy sofa and another flat screen? not that i planned on spending time in front of it, but nice touch. many people were at the pool, even kids and we couldn't hear a thing.

If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a motorcyclist, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got to make the journey down to Key West on a motorcycle\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s absolutely incredible and the only way to travel down to America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most southern paradise. The seven-mile bridge along highway one was a blast to ride. As for the hotel, it was\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 nice. Overall, the room and bed were comfortable, but the entire property looked worn and in need of some updating. According to the shuttle driver for the hotel, the property was closed down for several months undergoing repairs after the last hurricane, which is very common for this particular area. I guess the property, along with all the other hotels frequently get damaged during hurricane season, which might explain the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153weathered\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd look of the hotel. Although our room was nice, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t perfect. The sofa in the living room was dirty and stained, but comfortable. The shower, toilet and bathroom areas were very clean and modern. The pool area was small, but well maintained. The staff was very friendly and professional, which was very much appreciated. The free hourly shuttle to town was a nice touch, but we ended up riding our Harley Davidson most of the time, which was actually more appropriate given Key West\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hang loose\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd atmosphere. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget to visit the world renowned \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sloppy Joe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bar\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and purchase a cheesy T-shirt as a souvenir. Oh, and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget to get your photograph with the famous mile marker. Lastly, if you get a chance to visit Key West and you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take the time to enjoy watching a sunset or two, then you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve completely overlooked the primary reason to visit Key West!", "Date": "May 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "La Canada, CA", "Title": "\u201cQuite pleased with my stay\u201d", "Author": "ual95", "ReviewID": "UR7628105", "Content": "I was quite pleased with this hotel.

I checked for lodging and found the only \"nice\" place available was the Sheraton Suites. In previous visits to Key West we stayed around Old Town, so I was a bit leery about staying so far away. However, after reading the reviews on this site we decided to go for it. BTW, locals in Key West told us that there were about 900 rooms short this season because of renovations and conversions. So, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a last minute planner like us, you may be out of luck getting a choice room. As others have noted on this site, the Sheraton Suites is on the other side of the island but they do have a free shuttle which takes you to the other Westin property near Mallory Square. The shuttle was crowded and there was standing room only in all the trips we took. The drivers were all locals and passed on good information to all of us \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they also dropped you off elsewhere if it was on the way. Still, this does lock you in to a time schedule, which is not what Key West is all about for us. Overall, I did enjoy the Sheraton Suites stay. The staff was VERY friendly and helpful. Unlike a previous review I read here, I especially found the restaurant manager, Pablo, to be quite concerned for the comfort of his guests. He was in the restaurant at all hours, and we had some good chats with him. There is also a nice pool, quiet bar, and lovely landscaping. Our room was very clean and large \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we got the corner suite with the balcony \u00e2\u20ac\u0153overlooking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the ocean. However, if you look at the pictures I took you will see that a busy highway was between the balcony and the ocean (specifically, Smathers Beach). There was lots of car noise during rush hours but at night it was pretty quiet. It is also an easy walk across the street and the man-made beach was white and pretty. There are, however, no waves since the offshore reef keeps them at sea. Finally, the mattress on our king bed was just as advertised \u00e2\u20ac\u201c WONDERFUL! If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve read this far you have seen me use the word \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quiet\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd several times. I believe this would make the Sheraton Suites ideal for someone who is seeking a more restful stay, or families with children. However, we missed the nightlight and boisterous atmosphere around Duvall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6that is why we enjoy Key West so much.

We had read the info on Key West before we booked our trip, so we had an idea of what it would be like. The Sheraton has recently been refurbished. The room was clean and updated, very nice suite. The hotel is across the road from Smather's beach. This is a man made beach, they bring the sand in each year from the Bahamas we were told. Bring water shoes for sure, the coral makes it rough on your feet. The water is shallow and there is a lot of coral. You can rent chairs and umbrellas there, $10 a piece for the day. The pool at the Sheraton is fine. The beach was closed a day or so while we were there because the bacteria count was high. They say that this is common since the water is shallow and without a lot of rain, the water can move and clear, so therefore the bacteria count gets high. We did rent bikes one of the days and rode down to the state park, Fort Zachary. Follow the bike route, don't walk it. Fun bike ride. The beach there is better, deeper, but again, a lot of coral. We had a lot of fun walking around the town. We did do the Conch train tour through the town. 90 minutes long, $25 a piece. Gave good info about the history and sights of Key West, Old Town. After we did the tour, we were able to go walk back to the sights we wanted to visit. We did see the Butterfly Conservatory, great place to visit if you like butterflies. $10 each to get in. We also visited the Lighthouse and Hemingway house. Both were across the street from one another. Both were $10 to get in, can get $1 off coupons at visitor's center. Do the tour at Hemingways house, free with admission, just tip the tour guide. YOu will find that tips are requested at any of the places that offer tours. We did go on the Sebago sunset cruise for $35 each. If you are a drinker and don't care that you are really just floating out on the water, not really a fun boat ride, then it is ok. We are not drinkers, so the $70 was a waste. I can see the same sunset from Mallory's Square. We did go to Mallory's square each night to see the sunset and watch the street performers. They request tips at the end as well, but many of the shows are really fun to watch and worth the tip money. It is a must see. Although we would have liked to have done the Haunted House tour and Truman's White house tour, we ran out of time. The shuttle is free from the Sheraton each day each way, but it only is on the hour. It leaves the hotel on the hour and drops you off in front of the Westin. Then at 20 after the hour it leaves the Westin and returns to the Sheraton. Only runs until 10:20 at night, after that you are a $16 taxi ride home. Now, we stayed at the Sheraton because we wanted to be at the beach, but as it turns out, since the beaches are not good, I would rather have stayed at the Westin so that I can be in the middle of everything without having to worry about the timing of the shuttle. The restaurants were fine... not too expensive. We really liked La Trattoria, Leto's, and Kelly's. In Key West, you will find chickens running everywhere....this is from the olden days when they used to have cock fighting..now those chickens just keep on reproducing......you will here at times roosters crowing at 6:30 am!! Many people love Key West, but we found that many don't . Not for kids at all... just a relaxing place to hang out, relax, learn some interesting history, eat in outdoor cafes... not a beach thing, just a relaxing kind of thing... there are a lot of bars around if you like that scene.... snorkeling is also suppose to be great, wished we had time to fit that in.....will go back, again without the kids, not right away, but in a few years and will most likely stay at the Westin instead to be in town..... one more thing.... we took a flight from Newark to Miami and then the smaller hopper to Key West... if you don't take the hopper, it is about a 4 hour drive from Miami...many people that we spoke to who took the drive instead of the hopper ...well they wished they had flown it instead... very long drive on a one lane road.... good luck!!!!", "Date": "April 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "milwaukee", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, mediocre service\u201d", "Author": "kariMilwaukee", "ReviewID": "UR7368720", "Content": "We spent spring break at the Sheraton Suites in Key West.

From our room we could enjoy listening to the soloist who played easy listening music during happy hour. The pool and grounds were very nice and well kept. Very lush and tropical. The only downer were the roosters that woke us up at 5:00 a.m. every morning. The first night we called the front desk to see if someone could shoo them away from the courtyard near our room, but it was to no avail. We later found out that the roosters are everywhere in key west and are considered just \"part of the experience\". We found the food and service there to be subpar. The breakfast buffet was not very enticing. Everything was cold and the french toast was hard, as if it had been sitting there for hours. Our waiter pushed us into getting the $15 buffet, indicating that to order off the menu would take at least 1/2 hour. Not worth it. The beach is across the street, but there are no beach chairs provided by the hotel, they cost $10 a day. The sand is soft and it is a nice beach, although the road runs adjacent to it and is somewhat noisy. We drove our rental car into town instead of taking the shuttle, but parking is hard to come by and everything is metered. 10 cents gets you a single minute on the meter. We found key west to be not exactly the place for children. Ours are 4 and 7 and there really wasn't much for them to do other than hang out at the pool. It is really geared more towards shopping and night life. Mallory square for sunset was wonderful, lots of shows to watch and a lot going on.

Booked the hotel through the starwood website and this seemed to be one of the last places available as we were kind of last-minute with our reservations. The only complaint about the hotel was the doubling of price for Dec. 30 and 31st. I guess if you \"want to play you got to pay\" for new years' weekend in Key West. The last 5 nights of our stay was 189$ per night which we thought was very fair given the time of year. I had not read any reviews of this place prior to our stay and was suprised to hear peoples' complaints. Other than a few guys doing some painting and some construction supplies in the parking lot, the hotel seemed to have most of the renovatons complete. Our room was very spacious and clean. Everything seemed brand new, especially the bathroom. Housekeeping was perfect all week with turndown service, towels and chocolates each night. As we always seemed to get a late start to the day(lots of KW rumrunners) the room was cleaned daily between 12-2pm. The shuttle service was never late all week! I know for sure they had 2 busses on new years eve and the riders we were with did not mind standing for the short 10 minute ride. Some have complained about the hotel being 2-3 miles from downtown but one thing we did was bring our bicycles with us on or trip. The bike ride never seemed to be strenuous or long(not many hills in KW) and you get to see everything on KW when you are on a bike! Found a roller hockey rink a half mile away from the hotel and got to watch a couple games for free- a nice treat. Did not eat at the hotel so cannot comment there. I did think that the poolside bar closed a bit early, but there are so many bars open till 3am it did not matter(be careful on your bike here!) One thing I must comment on that is not horel related is the restaurant service level you can expect in KW. At best I feel it is a 50/50 chance at EVERY place you go to! After reading 100's of reviews I think I am not alone on this issue. The price of your dinner will NOT reflect the service given at any time. Saw great attitudes and food at O.B.'s for $17 and saw totally average service at commodores for $180! If you consider yourself a discerning traveller beware of the laid-back attitude of KW, sometimes it is the best thing and other times it is not.
