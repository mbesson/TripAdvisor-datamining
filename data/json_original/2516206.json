Just recently I had a situation where I was in Phoenix without a room and the city was quite full. I stopped here to see what could be done. I was so surprised at the steps taken to check out all the reservations and find one that was actually not going to make it, so I was able to take the room for the night. I found I needed to stay additional nights when the hotel was full. Again Trish on the front desk went to work and found an opening that allowed me to stay my needed nights.

I don't make that statement lightly. The genuine warmth here surpassed the treatment in the Royal Suite of a prominent cruise line, and the high roller suite at one of the most luxuriant hotels in Vegas. I kid you not. Our flight arrived late at night, but Theo was there in minites with the shuttle to pick us up. His conversation was friendly and upbeat without being intrusive. In short, he made us smile after a long and tiring flight. When we pulled up to the hotel, Dan was waiting outside to greet the shuttle and see us inside. While checking in, he got us some ice cold bottles of water, while Theo was offering everything he could think of to make our stay more comfortable. We felt like royalty! With snack bags that they gave us in hand, we headed to our room, where we found two more bottles of water and a Twix bar set out for us. The next morning Trish at the front desk had the same friendly and helpful attitude, so I know this must be fostered by the management among all employees. Kudos to GM Gary Bowers for encouraging staff to go above and beyond. This hotel gets that it only takes small investments of amenities, provided with a genuine friendly smile, to completely turn a guest's day around and create lifelong fans.

The cleanliness of the hotel and attentiveness of the staff was great! Unfortunately, the breakfast was below standards usually seen at the Hampton Inn. The eggs were very dry, the sausage patties were cold and there was absolutely no coffee... NO COFFEE?? That's right, coffee was not available until after I had already finished my meal. I would have thought someone would have had extra coffee going. We ate at 8AM and there was 1 other person eating breakfast so it wasn't like it was crowded. The prior evening, the desk clerk reserved the 10AM shuttle to the airport. This would have given us ample time to catch our 12:00PM flight without any stress. Much to my surprise, as it was Christmas day, the shuttle driver was not working and the Inn used an outside company for shuttle service. My wife and I went downstairs at 9:40AM. The clerk immediately asked for my family name. I told him the name and he confirmed we were on the 10AM shuttle for the airport. At 10AM, the contract shuttle had not yet arrived. The clerk called the vendor / contract shuttle who advised they were on the way. By 10:15AM, the shuttle had still failed to arrive. I inquired with the desk clerk about the shuttle and he again called the contract company who said the driver would arrive momentarily. By 10:30AM the shuttle driver finally arrived. He did not handle our bags and walked inside to use the restroom! We were in a hurry, he was 30 minutes late and now he was taking a restroom break??? Unacceptable!!! We finally got into the shuttle van and arrived at the airport at 10:40AM. My flight was to depart at noon and was boarding at 11:30AM. My wife was extremely stressed out and after checking in and going through security, It was 11:15. While we still had enough time to catch our flight, the stress we hoped to avoid by staying at the Hampton Inn was ever present. It was not a good beginning to the holiday vacation. One of my biggest complaints was that there was a maintenance man speaking to us at the hotel while the front desk clerk called the shuttle company. Why one of them couldn't take the shuttle van parked just outside of the door, is beyond me. I felt that there should have been a backup plan, should the contract company not arrive. We didn't miss our flight, but I was sadly disappointed by the service provided by this Hampton Inn. I must commend the staff, as they were friendly and helpful, they just seemed unsure of what to do when the shuttle didn't arrive. I almost left and parked myself (which would have been counter productive, as the entire reason I booked the hotel was for the parking.) The inn was extremely clean and I was impressed by the wonderful rooms. I just wish the breakfast staff would have ensured the food was prepared better and that the shuttle situation would have been resolved to my satisfaction.", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "SE, AZ", "Title": "\u201cExceptional value\u201d", "Author": "ind_sub", "ReviewID": "UR122070861", "Content": "We needed a place to unwind for two nights and this was our choice.

The airline suggested the Hampton Inn on South 48th Street. The shuttle driver was very nice.About a half hour after we checked in, the phone rang. We were puzzled, as no one could possibly know where we were. It was the desk clerk, asking us how we liked the room. I've never had this happen at any hotel before [even Hampton Inn's at other locations]. A few hours later, we heard noise by the door of our room, and found a copy of the bill had been slipped under the door. At every other hotel I've stayed at, I've gotten this paperwork while checking out, or occasionally, while checking in.At 8:30 am, a knock at the door from housekeeping woke us from a sound sleep. Check out was at noon, and there was no \"Do Not Disturb\" sign available for us to use. I've never before stayed at a hotel for a single night where the housekeeping staff showed up before check out time. They knew we were checking out that day, and the room would have to be completely stripped at that time, so what was the rush? And if early-morning housekeeping is the practice at this hotel, why no \"Do Not Disturb\" signs for guests who prefer to actually sleep in the room they've rented?One of the things I normally find enjoyable about hotel stays is the pleasure of being undisturbed in a private space. I felt that this enjoyment was violated. The idea of hotel staff actually waking up guests hours before check out time a startling novelty.It was impossible to feel comfortable in this room.
