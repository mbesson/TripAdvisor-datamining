I was in town on business for a few days and needed a retreat away from the louder crowds, who come to Amsterdam to let loose - but at a reasonable price. The Sipermann is just that: A no-frills, uncomplicated, impeccably clean and very reasonably priced accommodation, but still located in-midst of the city. It's also right around the corner from the beautiful Vodelpark. One thing that may be an issue for guests at this hotel is the combination of a steep stairwell and lack of an elevator. This is not a fault of the hotel itself, but characteristic of traditional architecture in Amsterdam per se. I stayed on the top floor and consequently hauled my luggage up (and down) three flights of stairs - but this is also the case in many other narrow (read traditional) buildings in this city, hotels and private homes alike. The rooms at the Sipermann are relatively small, so they are better suited for people who spend less time indoors and more time on the town. Because the wi-fi did not reach to the 3rd/top floor, I was provided with an ethernet cable upon checking in. There's no wake-up service, so bring a reliable alarm clock. There is a 20 Euro cash deposit required for the house/room key, which you will get back upon checking out and a 7% surcharge for paying with cards.", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Slovenia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "revolution81", "ReviewID": "UR113153518", "Content": "We liked staying at The sipermann.

It wasn't the top floor, so there were no slanted walls like someone here had mentioned. Ceilings were high, no stooping needed. The hotel was full with other young people, so there was not a 3-person room we could have switched to when one person in our group couldn't end up coming to Amsterdam. - Yes, the stairs are steep. (and as far as we could tell, no elevator) - Yes, there is a 40 euro key deposit, we got it back at the end. Unfortunately we only had 1 key card for room (so the 4 of us had to share) - Yes, there is a surcharge if you pay by credit card or if you arrive past 10pm, but there's a bank machine not too far to help solve the first problem. - Yes, there is a slight curry smell (but only in the reception area), as someone here mentioned, but I don't know why this bothered them. it's mild, not overpowering. - Someone on here said they didn't get fresh towels and bedding each day. So we were surprised that we DID get new sheets and towels and room cleaning every day! - Yes, the room is small, but it was spacious enough (even if all 4 of us had been there). We didn't have much baggage though, just backpacks. - I had a great sleep every night. My friends had some trouble sleeping because the beds were too soft for them (you might even say they were sagging beds... but again, I had no problem with this so it depends on you). - The owner was pleasant. (Didn't even give me dirty looks after I threw up in the stairwell on our first day.) - Supposedly there is WiFi, but we didn't try it out because we didn't bring our laptops. There is no computer there for guests. The location was great. Close to the museums and Vondel park, close to Melkweg where we had a concert to go to. Convenient to get around on the tram system. We went on a weekend so a lot of hostels were booked up or expensive. A 4-person room at Sipermann hotel was the same price or even cheaper than if we had paid for 4 dorm beds in a hostel, so that's a main reason why we chose this hotel (we ended up paying 33 euro each per night, while the popular hostels can jack up their prices to 45 euro per night!). Coming from Eastern Europe, I still found these Western prices a shocker. (I rated this hotel as a 4/5 value, but that's only relative to other Amsterdam options.)

And it is also commonplace for the owners to stay in part of the facility and rent out the rest. Consequently, the rooms could be a little \"tight\". The Sipermann is ideally located - close to the Vondel Park, where one can go for a run and close to a happening part of town - Liedesplein, walking distance from the hotel. This is where the attraction ends. The room itself is very small. The bath-cum-toilet will surely rank as the smallest that I have seen in all my travel.

Booked this hotel with the help of the Holland Tourist Info Office at the airport. This was the only 2 star hotel available at that time and our alternate was a 4 star hotel which was 40 euros more expensive. We experienced both the room with shared bathroom facilites and also the room with toilet and bath. As mentioned by a previous review, you do notice the smell of indian style cooking and spices upon entering the building. I believe the people in charge live in the basement and the aroma of their cooking \"whafts up\" to the main corridors. It's actually a pleasant smell if you like east asian cuisine but not good if you don't enjoy that kind of food. The staircase is indeed narrow and steep. It was a struggle to bring our suitcase up and down the stairs. There is no \"sound proofing\" in these old buildings so we heard every step of everyone that walked pass our room. On some occasions that the other guests came back late at night, you are actually awakened by the noise they create. The beds we had in the shared bathroom unit were small, more like the size of cots, about 2/3 the size of a single bed. The shared toilet had a floor mat that was so dingy and gross. Don't know when it was last changed or washed as it was all matted down and dirty. For the shared shower, be sure to wear slippers when you go in. The grout is black and you can see mildew all over the edges. We had a chance to also stay in one of the bigger rooms. As mentioned also in a previous review, none of the furniture pieces match. The glass on the table top is cracked. There is literally a caked layer of dust on the radiator. A similar piece of floor mat can be seen in the toilet. The shower stall had strands of long hair dangling from the rubber mat. We brought along disinfectant wipes and literally wiped up layers of dirt from the cabinet. The size of the bed is just the size of the 2 \"cots\" pushed together. There is no free breakfast included. Breakfast costs 5 euros and has to be booked ahead of time. The rooms have a small TV which is located high above the cabinet. The only comfortable way to watch TV is when you are in bed. Otherwise be prepared to get a strained neck. The bed linen was clean and crisp on the first night. However, the blanket that was overtop of your sheets doesn't seem to have been washed and we got itchy after sitting on top of it. The sheets and pillowcases were NEVER changed through out our stay although they did make up the bed everyday. Towels were changed daily but bring your own soap as the we only got 2 tiny pieces of soap on the first night and never got any on subsequent nights. We also noticed that the cleaner placed the clean sheets and clean towels right on top of the carpets in the hallway. Honestly, the carpets in the hallway did not look clean. Hated to imagine sleeping in the same sheets that were on the floor and towelling yourself up in the same towels that were on the floor. As to noise, if you have the windows open, the traffic from the nearby street and sound of the trams are clearly heard. If we had known we would have spent the extra 40 euros for a better hotel. We have stayed in many 2 star hotels all over Europe and this one is by far the worse and least deserving of it. If the proper authorities are reading this maybe it's time for a reinspection and reclassification of this hotel. As we went around town we saw many other 2 star hotels that looked much better maintained. What a huge disappointment.
