I chose that hotel because of the reviews I read and I was not disappointed. Staff are very nice and helpful, it is a very good location to stay in Paris (near Opera, Pigalle, Montmartre). The metro is 2mins walk (Metro st Georges), the location seems to be safe enough and the best for me is also to have Carrefour City just down the road :-)) The disappointment is the single room is very very tiny!! But bathroom and toilettry were good enough and clean - the shower is fantastic with lots of pressure but I think, instead of have a shower curtain, it is better to have put a shower door, so that you do not feel claustrophobic and the water will not run all over the floor. I also enjoyed the fact that for the same breakfast price (\u20ac13) you can have it brought up in the room, which saved me some time in the morning. I will probably stay there again if I come with my partner or friend in the superior room, but unfortunately I will skip it if I come back alone..", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hamilton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat value.

After reading hundreds of Trip Advisor reviews, I chose Hotel France Albion for my three nights in Paris (stayed December 2011) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I was not disappointed! Hotel France Albion completely exceeded my expectations. My stay was a complete dream from the moment I confirmed by booking (they replied immediately in English by email) to the moment I (regrettably) boarded my shuttle to CDG. The staff put up with my dreadful attempts at French, spoke English fluently and were very friendly. They were also very helpful with everything from assisting with directions, organising my CDG shuttle and holding my luggage (both when I arrived early on my first day and when I checked out before going to the airport) to sourcing a corkscrew for me! I booked well in advance and got an amazing rate on a superior double room (Room 50) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was stunning and impeccably clean (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a bit of a clean freak and hard to impress, but I was certainly impressed). The room was serviced every day and the bed was exceptionally comfortable. The bathroom was huge (bigger than my bathroom at home!) and the water pressure and temperature were perfect. I was also impressed with the toiletries and coffee / tea making facilities that were complimentary in my room. There was also free wi-fi, which was very handy. I thought the hotel was in a perfect location. I felt very safe walking around the area by myself at night and the Notre Dame de Lorette metro was literally a one minute walk away (I also felt very safe on the metro by myself at night). There are also heaps of amazing boulangeries, patisseries and grocers opposite the hotel and in the surrounding streets. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat the breakfast at the hotel (I preferred to grab a coffee and croissant to eat while I walked), but it smelled amazing! I am so thankful that I chose to stay at Hotel France Albion it definitely made my stay in Paris unforgettable.

It is located within walking distance of the Gare du Nord train station (the terminus of the Eurostar train) and close to two Metro lines (7 & 12).

However, there is a street one block over that has a number of markets, plus there is a Carrefour food store across the street. The rooms were basic and fairly small, but this is typical for Paris. When you are in Paris, you shouldn't be spending much time in your room. Some other reviews have commented that the 13 euro charge for breakfast is expensive and I guess the hotel has read the reviews, because when we were there, they dropped the rate to 9 euros. I think that is reasonable for what you are getting and you need to remember that you are in downtown Paris. For a price comparison, we went to the cafe across the street from the hotel for breakfast and for 9 euros all you got was juice, coffee, a coissant, and two eggs.

The desk staff really stand out. They are incredibly friendly and eager to help. I arrived at the hotel aroumd 11am and check-in wasn't supposed to be until 2pm, however the young woman at the desk called the housekeeper to prepare my room and within 30 minutes, I was settling in. After a long overnight flight, I appreciated that I didn't have to wait. I stayed on the first floor in a single. It was small with a twin bed, but it's a single so what can you expect? (I also sleep in a twin bed at home, so I can't complain about that lol). The bathroom was quite spacious. Everything was clean and there was soap, a shower cap, shoe shine and bath gel/shampoo in the bathroom. The room had a television (that I never watched), small desk, nightstand, telephone and a safe in the closet. The safe didn't work for me and I mentioned it but they probably forgot. No big deal. The hotel has great wifi and an elevator. The location is great. I was worried about noise when I read that there was a bar next door but I heard nothing. In fact, the hotel was very quiet. The hotel is close to 3 metros: Notre Dame de Lorette and St. georges (line 12) and Le Peletier (line 7). I was able to get where I needed to go easily. The only negative regarding location is getting there from the airport. I had the choice of taking the RER B to Gare du Nord then taking Bus 43 or taking the RoissyBus to Opera and taking a cab. I chose the latter. It's just that I was on a tight budget this trip so every euro mattered. It would have been nice to just be able to easily go from the RER to the metro to the hotel. Since I had an early flight, the hotel arranged a shuttle for me back to CDG. It cost 26 euros but the convenience was worth the expense. Right across from the hotel is a Carrefour grocery store and if you continue out to the other side of the Carrefour there's a farmer's market, bounlanger, butcher, etc. The area was quite safe and on Sunday, it was cool to see the Parisians out and about, buying their bread, doing their shopping, just strolling in the streets. :) I would definitely recommend this hotel!

You can also walk to Sacre Coeur (maybe 20min), the Opera (ca. 15min - the Roissybus straight from CDG airport also stops here), Galleries Lafayette (ca. 10min).

Poortravler really did his homework, researching nearly 300 hotels one at a time, and he sure picked a winner. Yes, the rooms in this charming old building are small by American standards, but large enough by any European measure. How much room do you need anyway? You're there to enjoy Paris, non? The two most important amenities: (i) central air conditioning, and (ii) a private bathroom with tub and showerhead, lots of fresh towels and washcloths, and hot, high-pressure water. The AC is preset by the hotel and can't be adjusted, but it is chilly enough to cool the room instantly and let you sleep well all night. It also means you can close the very efficient windows against the noise of the ubiquitous Parisian motorbikes. Don't even think of booking a room without air conditioning in August. As the other reviews have noted, the rooms are clean, the beds are comfortable, and the service is wonderful. We requested and received a refrigerator that we used for cold fruit and drinks. The WiFi is also free, so don't hesitate to take your computer. It will help you plan or change your itinerary once you arrive. The hotel's location in the 9th arrondissement near the Opera Garnier makes it accessible to everything in central Paris, and it's only half a block from a Metro station. The hotel's best value, though, is in its staff. We booked our accomodations through Aurelie, who speaks perfect English and is on the day desk. She was so kind and gracious to us throughout our stay, as were all the hotel employees. She gave us valuable tourist information and also made SURE that we booked the best return to Charles de Gaulle Airport. As it turned out, our return to the airport in a terrible thunderstorm would have been a disaster without her recommendation. If you take our advice and book with this little boutique hotel, you won't be sorry.

The hotel is located in the triangle between Gare du Nord (20 min walk), Montmartre (15 min walk to Moulin Rouge/Pigalle) and the Opera/Grand Boulevards district. I had a single room on the 5th floor which was pleasant and clean. The room itself was on the small side, but not unusual for Paris. As it was rather warm when we were there, the air-conditioning was a welcome relief after spending all day walking around. The only slight complaint that I have was that the room wasn't very well sound proofed, and the other people on the same floor as me were clearly much earlier risers than me, and were slamming doors and stomping around by about 6am which wasn't great. The breakfast (which was an additional \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13) wasn't included in my room, but to be perfectly honest, there are a number of patisseries and cafes within 5 mins walk, where you can get a pastry and a coffee for around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3.

Of course, this has included finding domestic and international accommodations. In all our travels, we've learned one important lesson: room and board and can either make or break your vacation--even if you use it for nothing but a crash site after touring all day/night. That is why I spend a great deal of time researching hotels/B&Bs/apartments before making a decision--typically several hundred 1-3 star hotels. Generally, I've found that hotels that can offer everything are few and far between. They may offer a prime location, a multitude of amenities, extraordinary service, palatial rooms, and feather beds, but you're going to pay out the nose for it. Like you, I'd prefer to have some or all of those things for a great price. But every once in a while a place comes along that really CAN offer it all. Such is the case for the France Albion Hotel. If I were to ever visit Paris again, I wouldn't even consider staying anywhere else. For 85euros, we were 5-10 minutes from the Paris Opera House (1 mile from the Louvre), had AC, a safe, fridge, free Wifi, cable TV, private bathroom, phone, breakfast (good price), and a large/quiet/clean room. Most importantly, Aurelie showed us the friendliest hotel service we've ever come across. She was able to offer suggestions and insight into Paris that really made our trip unforgettable. When you consider all the factors that go into making a decision on an accommodation, there's a good reason why this hotel ranks so high on Trip Advisor: it's a 2 star hotel with 4 star service.

This small hotel is very near metro stops on 2 different lines and is within easy walking distance of the Palais Garnier. It did not feel like a highly touristed neighborhood, and the neighborhood felt safe at all times of day (which is important to me, as a solo female traveler\u00e2\u20ac\u201deven fairly late at night, there were people walking their dogs or walking from the metro). And there was a supermarket across the street that sold food, wine, basic supplies, etc. during regular business hours. I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t call this hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location great, but I would definitely call it very good. My room was simply, charmingly, and cheerfully decorated; spotlessly clean; and accessible by elevator. As others have noted, the hotel makes good use of an unusual non-rectangular floor plan. My room looked out into a courtyard and was quiet. It was not a particularly spacious room, but it was larger than many hotel rooms in Paris and was well laid out. The bed was very comfortable and the water pressure and temperature were good. The optional breakfast buffet was more generous than many; for example, it including scrambled eggs in addition to a pleasing and reasonably extensive array of more commonly available items. (As with most hotel breakfat options in Paris, and elsewhwre in France, if all you want is coffee and a baguette or croissant, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably pay less if you go elsewhere.) By French criteria for star designations, which reflect which services are offered (without regard to the quality of those services), this is a 2 star hotel. The services of a French 2 star are more than adequate for my needs. Even in this context, the staff, who all spoke English, were wonderful and provided a level of service a cut above--well above--what I had expected given the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very affordable price range. For example, Martin worked with me extensively before my trip to try to obtain a ticket for an event I hoped to attend. (It turned out that the event was sold out even before tickets were offered to those who weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t season subscribers, but I truly appreciated his repeated efforts to check on their availability.) And before arriving in France, I had made multiple unsuccessful attempts to make dinner reservations at two restaurants outside Paris; a young woman at the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desk kindly and efficiently arranged both reservations for me. Two other specific features of this hotel might be of particular interest to travelers from the U.S.: (1) The computer that guests can use for a small fee has a qwerty keyboard. I had no idea how hard it would be to find a qwerty keypboard in France or how hard I would find it to use a non-qwerty keyboard! BTW, I think Wifi access was free for those with their own computer. (2) The linens include a washcloth. \u00e2\u02dc\u00ba I like to use a washcloth for exfoliation, but more importantly, I find a washcloth essential for minimizing the risk of losing a contact lens down a drain.

FIrst point - location, location, location! This place is fantastic if you want to be on the doorstep of sensational Montmartre. It reminded me a little of London's Soho with it's little pavement-sdie bars and restaurants, yet was more romantic and more, well, Parisian! The hotel is also surrounded by a vast array of lovely independent boutiques and magnificant bakeries, fruit stalls, wineries, fishmongers etc. There's also a handy supermarket across the road where we'd stock up on beer/water for our coolbag for our trips into the centre each day (saved us a fortune doing so!). We arrived on Eurostar, which also added weight to the location, as it was just a 20min (safe) stroll from Gard du Nord. Now for the hotel. Firstly, I've given it a 4, rather than a 5, because I've stayed in better places in other european cities. However, for Paris this would definetly be a '5', as, like in London, you will find it almost impossible to find a reasonably priced hotel in a great location not far from the centre (bar a Premier Inn/Travelodge). The room was clean and well presented. It had a smart tv that had french, italian, german and spanish channels on offer, along with BBC World. The staff were all very friendly, and were all good english speakers (though I'd urge you to at least try a little pigeon-french). The room was a little small to say it was a superior double, and whilst we could just about view the eiffel tower (we had an inside courtyard room on the top floor) it wasn't much of a view. I'm being picky though, as, again, you must remember that this is a review of a reasonably priced Parisian hotel. Some earlier reviews have suggested that it could be very noisy round the front, but I can only say that we didn't notice it being that busy on the road out front, and as the rooms have air-con, it shouldn't be a problem. Oh, I would also like to thank the staff for our upgrade. Upon arrival we were given the best Superior Double, which was such a lovely gesture to kick off our special weekend.

While searching for a hotel in Paris, we looked to www.tripadvisor.com for advice. Sure glad we did. We picked the Hotel France Albion based on the favorable reviews posted on the site. Booking was a breeze. We went to the hotel's website and they responded very quickly. Our plans changed and we had to move back our arrival date. Fabulous Fabienne assured us that would be no problem, and there would be no extra charge. She and Kelly (this hotel has plenty of friendly, competent staff) helped us complete our tourist visa requirements by faxing a confirmation of our booking directly to the French Embassy in Manila, and supplied us a copy through our travel agent. We doubt many other hotels would do that. The room was small but very clean. We requested a non-smoking room and that's exactly what they gave us. We stayed at a double room with bath on an upper floor. Looking out the window, we had a bonus glimpse of the Eiffel Tower. We did have to look past tin roofs which were not exactly pleasing to the eye, but as long as we gazed upward and towards the Eiffel, the view was okay. We used the in-room safe, and even though we did not leave all our valuables there, we felt very secure and protected. Every morning we'd leave the room key with the front desk, and Fabienne would always give us the weather forecast for the day. We'd come back from our sightseeing at past 11pm. We never felt unsafe walking the few meters from the St. Georges metro station to the hotel. We skipped the breakfast option and instead bought delicious croissants, etc. at a boulangerie a short distance from the Notre Dame de Lorette metro station. It's on a narrow street by the side of the church. Around the corner is a Monop grocery and a mini grocery store from where we got our supply of bottled water for the duration of our stay. The hotel is walking distance to the Opera and Montmartre area. Since we arrived from London via Eurostar at Gare du Nord station, we just walked to the hotel.

The staff spoke English well and was great. Only things we did not enjoy about staying at this hotel was that we did have to get on the metro station a lot to see the major sites, we witnessed people peeing on the street as we walked home two nights in a row, we were not in a high tourist part of town so the locals in a grocery store hated us, we had to leave our hotel key with the front desk every time we left which made us a little nervous, and the hotel was not easy to find if you did not get off the metro at the exact stop. I would suggest staying in this hotel because of the staff because the two women we dealt with were wonderful!! They were perfect and made the experience awesome.

The hotel door (single entrance) is locked late at night (just knock) as a precautionary measure, which I loved, however we never ONCE felt at ease walking around the entire Montmarte/Paris area... even Pigalle at midnight (touristy=safety).

The price of the room was good and there's a very handy little supermarket across the street for drinks and snacks. So why only three stars? One word: noise. There is some external noise if your room is located on the street-facing side of the hotel, but no more than you'd expect in a busy city like Paris. It's the noise from inside the hotel that's the real problem. During our visit we were treated to all manner of nocturnal disturbances, including a woman yodelling, laughing and shouting into the early hours, and shrieking from the upper floors the cause of which I wouldn't like to imagine. On top of this, there's the constant door slamming. The rooms have the kind of doors you might find in office buildings, and have no sound insulation whatsoever. Whenever anyone slammed their door (and our fellow guests seemed incapable of simply closing their doors) the sound would travel through the entire building. Not much help after midnight when you're trying to sleep. Basically, if you can sleep through any amount of racket or are prepared to invest in a set of industrial strength ear-plugs then this could be the perfect Parisian hotel for you.

The hotel and the room were very clean and the service was remarkable. We were very impressed with this nice 2-star, which is definitely a very superior 2-star. This hotel is not luxurious and the rooms are small like they would be in most European hotels, but they are not tiny. In any case, we were not looking for luxury. When we first walked into the room (Room 10), we thought about how small it was, but we got over that pretty quick. The room was clean and tidy. The room has a small tv and a safe (great plus!). Our room had one window overlooking what they call \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the courtyard\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I wish I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d taken a picture so you could see, but the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much, is what I was told that makes this a Superior room. I guess it makes for a quieter room, but in any case, Notre Dame de Lorette seemed like very quiet street. If I stay there again, I think I would try out the regular room. The bathroom had the usual basic amenities (bathrobes were a nice touch), a window which makes it nice and bright, and a shower/tub. Even in 4-star hotels you may find a dirty or slightly moldy shower curtain, but I don't think you ever will in this hotel. There was hot water all the time and good water pressure. I know in France you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d probably want to try a lot of different places to eat, but the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s American-style buffet was really nice. I would definitely recommend trying it (scrambled eggs, bacon, potatoes, delicious cheese, ham, yogurt, cereal). Once you sit down, they will bring you great coffee and wonderful bread and croissants. Now, our favorite part about this hotel was Kelly! Kelly works at the front-desk and was extremely nice and helpful. She made recommendations, gave us directions, marked our maps, and even made us reservations for a dinner cruise and a cabaret-show. She is definitely one of the reasons we liked this hotel so much and why we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d recommend it so highly. Two more things... Use the metro... there is a couple of stations a block from the hotel and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s incredibly easy to get around (Once you can explain to the metro person the kind of tickets you want in English and a bit of sign language... Of course if you speak French you will do much much better than us, but we had Kelly write it down for us on the second day, because the first day we had no luck with a kinda-rude metro lady) All the stations have easy-to-understand maps and signs. Also, the cabs always take longer than they say they will when you call them and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extremely hard to stop one on the street, so take that into account. It is a shame I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember the name, but there was a wonderful restaurant, about two blocks from the hotel with incredible food and great service. We had lunch there on our last day. As soon as I find the business card, I will edit this posting... but I did give a card to Kelly, so if you are heading there pretty soon, ask her (it is not the Fontaine Fiacre, she recommended it but we never tried it).

With the windows closed at night, there really wasn't any noise even when the garbage trucks went by. The bathroom was fairly large for what I expected, although I did have trouble figuring out exactly how to get the toilet to flush properly on the first try (I'd only once before had such trouble with a European toilet!).

It isn't such a problem if you're an early riser, but for me who was tired of walking each morning (and, later on, had a cold so wanted to sleep in a little), the noise was a little annoying because I'm an extremely light sleeper. But the noise was only noticeable in the morning when they vaccuumed the carpeting, so nothing that should turn a potential guest away. I didn't notice any noise coming from the rooms next to me. The only way I knew the rooms were occupied was hearing them shut the doors in the morning. You do have to give them your room keys when you leave during the day - this way they know when you've left so you don't have to worry about them coming to clean your room while you're in the shower. Also, it's nice because you don't have to worry about losing your key while you're running around out in the city. The location is great. Frankly, I don't think being right next to the Eiffel Tower or another landmark would be the best - this hotel is literally a block away from two metro stations (Ntre Dme de Lorette and St Georges) so you can choose whether to approach the hotel from uphill or downhill (mind you, very slight hill). For when you first go to the hotel, I would really suggest the St Georges stop. Go toward the brasserie and then pass it so it's on your right and the hotel will be down the street on your right. My husband and I got a little turned around coming from the other metro station and when we found the St Georges one, we thought that would be the better one for first-time visitors to use - especially with heavy suitcases. The pictures of the rooms that are currently online are very accurate, although I didn't see the breakfast room... There's a good patisserie acorrs from the Notre Dame de Lorette metro station where you can get a croissant or something for breakfast. We did that or picked up something wherever our destination was instead of paying for the hotel's breakfast. One thing to consider is the time to get to the airport. We left the hotel around 9:30AM for our 1PM flight and arrived shortly before our flight boarded. This was due to problems finding the ticket booth in the train station for the RER train, the length of time getting to the place to check-in, only to find they changed the terminal and had to walk to the other end of the airport, the person checking passports taking 15 minutes per person, everyone getting a secondary screening when going back to the U.S. (despite no terror threat to the flight or in general), and construction at the airport to the Air France plane necessitating a 30 minute bus ride from the main terminal to the Air France area where the plane was... So plan to give yourself a lot of time when leaving the hotel if you're flying.", "Date": "April 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "De Pijp", "Title": "\u201cCharming Hotel\u201d", "Author": "stadhouderskade", "ReviewID": "UR7364089", "Content": "After reading many of the reviews on this website, we were convinced that this was the place to stay.

The bathroom was big and very clean as well. The airconditioning is a modern wall unit and worked very well, we had to turn it off because we were freezing at one point. Right in front of the hotel there is a small supermarket. Every morning we would buy prociutto, fruit, and yogurt. Then we went down the street and to the right, going towards the Notre Dame de Lorette Metro Station, right in front there is a bakery that sells amazing croissants and brioch.

Dominick directed us to a newer restaurant in the area, Fuxia, which had great food, wine and atmosphere.

(was not advertised as room with view of tower, thankfully, though!) the breakfast is steep at 12 euro per person but is very good and we ate there every morning primarily out of convenience - they bring you choice of tea or coffee and they supply milk and oj, eggs to boil or poach in a metal box/machine - a variety of pastries and some excellent apricot and rasberry preserves (in big jars near buffet) also served scrambled eggs, sliced potatos and bacon each morning and had yogurt and cereal also - the people at the desk were friendly and spoke english - the manager was a little brusque when we asked if we could leave post cards at the desk for mailing - she pointed to a mailbox outside as if we were idiots - sorry, but in U.S. it is no big deal to leave them at the desk and we did not notice the box outside - instead of being rude she could have told us to make sure we mailed them in the etranger slot for overseas, but luckily I knew that. - bill was correct and the stay was nice - rooms lock well - you can hear others coming and going but no big deal - elevator is bigger than another reviewer stated - will hold 4 people or at least two or three and some luggage", "Date": "April 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee, WI", "Title": "\u201cGreat European Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Hoss27", "ReviewID": "UR4987004", "Content": "Overall, my wife and I had a great stay at this hotel. Paris was wonderful in mid-March and this hotel made it even more so. The price was right, and the hotel was recently remodeled, clean, and up-to-date. The staff was fantastic. All spoke very good English and all were incredibly friendly, at all times of day as we came and went. Speaking from experience, you will not find a better hotel than this in Europe unless you are willing to spend an arm and a leg. The hotel is out of the major tourist districts (great if you want to experience the real Paris), but the location is so convenient. Two Metro stations are within a block or two away, making every major destination in Paris less than about a five minute train ride away. A short walk away from the hotel are some really nice little bakeries and cafes. Grab a couple bakery items at one of the corner bakeries and have a seat at the counter of the Cafe Bleu for a morning cafe au lait. When you first arrive, the Hotel France Albion can be a bit tricky to find. After a long flight from Chicago, it took my wife about an hour looking at maps and dragging our bags around on the Paris streets until we finally located the place. Here's a tip: take the Metro to the station Notre Dame de Lorette, and the hotel is immediately up the street and around the corner. Just search for the station on any of the maps in the metro stations. If you are looking for a great meal on the go at an inexpensive price, try a restaurant called Brioche Doree. Its a local chain, so you'll see them here and there throughout the city. For a real Parisian experience, find the street called Rue Cler and hang out a bit at the cafes and shops. Its not far from the Place des Invalides.", "Date": "April 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cFriendly and Clean Two Star Hotel\u201d", "Author": "ElizHan", "ReviewID": "UR4953315", "Content": "I booked this hotel based on reviews on Trip Advisor and was not disapointed.

I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sure what to expect from a two-star hotel, and was relatively pleasantly surprised. However, make no mistake: this is definitely a two-star hotel, although some of the reviews here may lead you to believe otherwise. The hotel, and the room itself, were small, but the staff was friendly (and English-speaking), and we were upgraded to a deluxe room on the second floor at no extra charge. Unhappy that this was a smoking room after asking for non-smoking, but for the extra space it was probably worth it, and the two windows opened very wide, so it was usually a non-issue. The room was very basic, no luxuries, but it was clean, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the most important thing. We had a double bed, small closet, and a desk in our room. There was enough space to store our large pieces of luggage without tripping over them. I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t figure out how to use the thermostat, and the room was very warm, which may be a problem in the summer (not in March, though!). The bathroom was very nice and clean, although there was no shower curtain in the tub. I never figured out how not to drench the entire bathroom during my shower. The neighborhood was okay, nothing to brag about, but nothing wrong with it, either. Two Metro stations are insanely close; we took it everywhere. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do nearly enough exploring until our last day, when we found some really cute shops and restaurants within blocks. Our room was facing the (busy) street, and since we slept with the windows wide open, there was a lot of noise. Particularly\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthere seemed to be a motorcycle club just up the street. The motorcycles never stopped! We adjusted pretty quickly, but others may not be so lucky. Never once did we hear the guests next door, although I know people were staying there. Used wireless Internet in the room--it cost a fortune (7E for 30 minutes, 12 for an hour, 24 for a full day), but I can't be without it. The staff wasn't terribly helpful when it came to dining recommendations, so we found everything ourselves. We did a lot of walking--to the Louvre, d'Orsay, etc. It can be done, but they're all long walks.
