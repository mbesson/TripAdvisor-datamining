Despite the Euro being annoyingly expensive at this time, we got a pretty good deal for what we paid. We were very warmly welcomed by the man with a goatie beard, who is most helpful. Also another young lady works at the desk most of the week and she was also very helpful. We soon felt very much at home and I would really like to thank the hotel for providing a Gideon Bible in three langugages that we all speak, it means a lot to us to have that since we cannot easily carry a Bible on our travels. To give an honest opinion of things we didn't find so good, we felt some of the staff at the weekend were not too helpful but we wouldn't rate it a bad hotel for that. Also we would suggest having fresh fruit juice at the breakfast a good idea. Of course being out on Nomentana traffic is slower going into Rome but then there are frequent buses and they will get you into town as quick as any other way.

Our friends had a room that was obviously used by smokers and despite leaving the windows open as often as possible, the reek of cigarette smoke stayed. Breakfast was OK, but the coffee, from a self-serve machine, was pretty ordinary. There were some good restaurants within easy walking distance - Hostaria Menenio Agrippa was the standout and if you go there on a Sunday night, make sure you have the lasagne special.

We had seen it on trip adviser and other sites and the rates were good (About \u00a370 per night for the 2 of us including breakfast) but as we were shown to our room, it seemed strange for it to be outside the main door ! The room we were shown was absolutely fine and perfectly clean but smaller than the other rooms in the hotel and it appeared to be an old staff room (connected to the private room in main reception by a door). This didn't bother us as we only slept there but it might bother other people. The only problem that we found was like many other hotel rooms in Italy, it had no tea or coffee making facilities which would have been nice. Apart from this, the hotel was lovely. Only 5 minutes walk down some steps to the local shops and a good range of deli's, markets and cafes were available. We would recommend going further up Via Nomentana until you find a little cafe on the left where you can get fantastic range of coffes for about 1.50 euro (rather than 3 at the hotel) and also a little deli on the right called Papero (something) where you can get anything from water to fresh local prepared pasta dishes(about 3 - 4 euro per portion) , pizza (10 euro per kilo) and lovely local rice balls (80 cents per ball) all served by a lovely local couple who were more than patient with our poor Italian. Ignore what most people say, travel into the centre of Rome (termini) took no more than 25 minutes even on the most crowded and busy days and the buses run every 10 minutes or so (recommend the number 90 as you can buy a ticket onboard that one when you go in the back door). Otherwise get a tourist bus pass or Roma pass which will give you unlimited travel throughout the whole of Rome for 3 days and is valid as soon as you validate it for the first time (no need to stamp it onboard the buses after that). Overall, this hotel is great as it's imaculately clean, bedding and towels are changed every day, breakfast was huge (although slightly limited if you arrive after 8.30), staff although not particularly friendly were pleasant and the hotel has a nice location once you find it.

Found the hotel via allhotels.com it was under \u00a3300.00 for two adults for 7 days (great value in Rome!) On arrival at Ciampino Airport we took the Terravision bus outside. There is a booth in the airport (or you can book online, it's the same price) 4 euros each way directly to Termini in the centre of Rome. At the Termini, the bus goes round the bus stances, the no 90 is on the road side as you go past (look out and you can spot it). We then bought a ticket at the newspaper kiosk (or there is a machine at the bus stances get a 1 euro ticket). A 1 euro ticket is valid for 75 mins after buying or a ticket up to midnight (unlimited journeys) is 4 euros. Make sure to validate your ticket in the machine in the bus itself (an inspector was on one of our buses advised us to do so). No 90 buses are very frequent. The bus journey takes about 25-40 mins (traffic dependant!). You want to get off at the Sempione stop. Its after the bridge on the Via Nomentana (long straight road). Then the easiest way is to follow the road round past street market stalls, past a small cafe on the right hand side. On the left hand side will be a restaurant called HOSTARIA MENENIO AGRIPPA (which is GREAT!!!!!!!! Lovely staff and a great menu of Roman and Italian dishes) There is a newspaper stall on the right directly opposite the restaurant. Go up the steps behind that and the Sunrise is on the left at the top. We were met by lovely staff who all spoke good English and were very helpful. Our room was on the first floor, seemed spacious to me and was spotlessly clean. Breakfast was 7-10 and was a very nice buffet style (16 euros for both of us) within a room on the basement level. Wifi was 20 euros for the whole week unlimited use and good connection. There were a few nearby shops such a chemist, two small supermarkets and a market with fresh fruit and veg. There were several bus stops both on the street and at nearby Sempione square. There are clear signs showing the direction of the buses, stops and numbers. We usually took the 60 (both 60 and 90 were really frequent) into the centre (Piazza Venezia) and everything was walking distance away. One of the days there we went to a Roma football match. Again it was easy using the buses to get there fairly quickly without having to go into the cetntre of town. The bus system in Rome has an English route planner online which was very helpful. On another day we went to a cooking course at Le Fate in Trastevere (highly recommended! review on tripadvisor also!) and found this area was the best value for eating out (set menus 12-14 euros each). Best tips we had 1. Learn a bit of Italian. Most people speak English but I think it really helps! 2. Drinks at the top of the museum behind Piazza Venezia (behind the massive Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II). There is a wonderful view and it's free to go to the cafe.

It was almost like being in a college dormitory asking the house mother for permission to have a person from the opposite sex come into my dorm room. Give me a break! The worst part of this scenario is the receptionist had the audacity to call up to my room to inform me that my visitor MUST come downstairs immediately and he has visited much too long in my room! My friend had only been in my room for 45 minutes. I was told that they would charge me for a double bed price if he doesn't come downstairs within 2 minutes!!!

Otherwise the hotel is very clean, the ventilation is working well, the breakfast was ok (very good croissants, not so good coffee) and the jacuzzi in the bathroom was perfect after a long day walking. You can also visit their terrace jacuzzi and have a nice view of the city. Take bus 60 to go in the center and 90 to get to termini station.

If arriving at Rome via Ciampino Airport our comments are: 1 Take Terravision Bus to Termini Railway/Bus Station (you can book online) Bus is clean and quick) Cost E4 each way. (About half an hour from airport) 2 Buy your tickets for bus no. 90 from Termini ( 1 Euro) at the papershop. Find the bus station ! It took me about 15mins. It's to the front of the station. Bendy bus was clean and fast,about 20mins to Piazza Sempione which is just after the river bridge and also just after the first bend after the long straight road of Via Nomentana. 3 The hotel is about 5mins walk after you get off the bus just up the road and to the right. There are a few signs if you look out for them. Better still get a map off the web before you go. If you are expecting to arrive in daylight as we were,think again, our plane was delayed 3 hours and it was dark when we got there. 4 We found the hotel to be very comfortable,well furnished and very very clean. The bedroom had aircon. which we needed one night as it was so hot. I wrongly thought our bedroom door wouldn't lock from the outside but you just have to slam it! The ensuite bathroom was very nice and spotless. Breakfast times are generous 7am-10am,. Don't get there at 9.55 as we did one day to find the breakfast room door bolted ( they did agree to let us in ) Breakfast is buffet style eat as much as you like coissants,doughnuts,bread rolls,cereals,cheese,ham pus tea/coffee (not forgetting the strange little packets of 'toast' which seem popular in italy.) 5 To get into the centre of Rome buy your tickets (E1) just outside the hotel in the paper shop. The no. 60 buses are incredibly numerous and travel this route almost in convoy so you won't have to wait very long in the heat. I don't understand what you are supposed to do with the ticket as the drivers are not interested in seeing them . There are little machines in the buses which I think may be to validate the tickets but no-one seems to bother. I heard if you get caught without a ticket it's a E100 penalty. 6 When in Rome you can see most of the main famous sights on foot in a couple of days if you've got a fair amount of stamina and decent footware. 7 It almost goes without saying that Rome is wonderful and if it's within you budget try the guided tour in English of the Coloseum and surrounding area for 22 euros ( lasts about 2hours) The guides were very knowledgable and humorous. 8 On our last night we 'discovered' the local restaurant -HOSTARIA MENENIO AGRIPPA about 100metres from Sunrise and would certainly recommend it if you want one which is non-touristy , non-pretentious and popular with locals. (Must be good!!) Our meal for two ( I had three courses,my wife two), plus half a litre of house red came to E 36.50.

When we asked the taxi driver he said \"oh no it's a long way from the centre 60 euro\" I was not happy and not wanting to get ripped off we decided to get the terravision bus to the termini which is a fantastic service one that I would highly recommend. As we were under the impression the Termini was close to our hotel we thought that we would just get a taxi from there being nightime. Again when we asked the taxi driver for the price he again said \"oh it's a long way!!! 30 euros\" By this time I was getting a bit cheesed off & was starting to wonder if we were ever going to get there. In the end we agreed on a price of 25 euros just watning to get there and settle down. When we arrived at the hotel wewere very suprised at how lovely it was. The room was very clean and newly decorated and the added benefit of air con. The staff were helpful and gave us a town map and also advised us that the number 60 bus took us to the centre and the 90 to the termini all running 24 hours. We then decided to go and find somewhere to get some food. After a short walk to the piazza we came across a pizza place that also did other food and was very very cheap!! We got a large piece of pizza each, chips and 2 beers for roughly \u00a38!! Needless to say we became regulars during our stay. So much for Rome being expensive! The next morning we went down for the included breakfast and again were pleased by the selection of food, certainly enough to start you off for the day!! We then got the 60 bus straight to the centre,you have to buy your ticket from the newsagent before you get on. We bought a ticket that you could use on the metro and the buses for about 4 euros. We had no problem at all with the buses or the metro and found that it was a great service that was very frequent. It took about 25 mins to get to the centre because of the traffic but this didn't bother us at all. At the end of our stay we were very comfortable with the buses and trains and even got the bus back to the termini (at the cost of 1 euro) before getting the terravision coach back to the airport. We would stay at the Sunrise again and with a bit of knowledge you get to stay in an area where you can eat out alot cheaper and enjoy a more relaxed surrounding away from the mayhem that is central Rome.

The reviews listed everything about this hotel as excellent, except complaints about the location. One reviewer stated that if you don't have a car, this is not a suitable location. We DO NOT AGREE. The Sunrise is located at the end of a dead end street. The dead end decends via stairs to the small community business area, where we spent several of our evenings. This is a residential community. It felt safe day and night. We were not so concerned about pick pockets as we were in the tourist areas. We walked leisurely to bars (for lunch) pizzarias, nice restaurants, banks, groceries, boutiques, and every thing we needed. Since the area is NOT a tourist area, many of the business owners did NOT speak English, and we had only a small phrase book for Italian. Most appeared delighted to have us in their establishments and went out of their way to communicate, either slowly and patiently, by finding someone to interpret, or sign language, and always made us feel very welcome. The hotel room was excellent, a small boutique hotel, with a deck on the roof, and a full breakfast each morning (extensive by european standards). The staff was friendly, and helpful. As to location. We loved it. The staff recommended tours which picked us up at the hotel. We like to be independent, so most of the time we went on our own.

The hotel is nicely furnished and is in a quaint part of town with a very good restaurant within 2 blocks of the hotel. I paid under 100.00 per night in March and the hotel was a great value for the money. I would stay there again for sure!", "Date": "April 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tuusula, Finland", "Title": "\u201cGood for a family\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4497244", "Content": "Nice hotel also for a family at least if you can book the family room as we did!

It is only 2.5 miles outside of the center of the city (Colosseum, museums, etc.), so it is possible to walk to many tourist sites without too much effort. The neighborhood is gorgeous and also walkable, but there aren't a lot of great restaurants (the pasticerrias are fine, though). Hotel staff was very friendly (adequate English), and my room was small, but clean and very comfortable. The bathroom is small, but you'll be surprised to find a sophisticated Jacuzzi shower (that's a shower and Jacuzzi jet streams, all in one). Housekeeping was very good. My only regret is that the complimentary breakfast was not \"a la Roma\" -- no Italian-style food, and worse, no fresh fruit. One serious thing to consider is travel to and from Fiumucino: rush hour traffic will cost you around 80 Euros (~$100) to get from the airport to the hotel. (Directions to the hotel perhaps are not explicit enough.) But you can make up for that on the trip back to the airport by requesting a taxi from the hotel -- on-time service, with a flat-rate fee of 55 Euros. I will stay again at this quaint hotel next time I am in Rome.

We got a very good deal from (---), less than \u20ac100 per night for a double room. I totally agree with some other reviewers, it was difficult to find first time if you did not arrive with taxi. The sign of the hotel is little bit confusing. But, once you found it, everything else is fine. We got room 504 first, but the maid obviouly forgot to clean (that room is quite small, I assume because we got discount price); the reception then gave us a very nice room 101. Air conditioning is working perfectly. The breakfast is all right. Bus 19 or 16 is the best choice to go to Termini station. From there, underground goes to all major sights. Roughly 20 minutes jounney. The downside of this hotel is: there is not many restaurants around, only ONE in the opposite of road. A lot of local people eat there as well. They close every Tuesday. But, the local Pizza is very good, we got a dinner for only \u20ac5. Staff is very nice and helpful, English speaking. Well, we are very happy for what we paid for. Compaing to the other hotels in city centre, I think I prefer this one. Away from city center, but reasonable distance. Safe box and frige all working fine. Enjoyed the stay. Maybe got taxi for the first time arriving.

The hotel is splendid inside and very well maintained and, although it is part of the suburbs we never felt ill at ease no matter what time of the day or night we were walking the few minutes to and from the bus stop. As said in other reviews, the Bus journey from the Hotel to Termini is a little bit of a trial (20-30mins) but out of the 10 or so journeys we took we only failed to get a seat twice and we ALWAYS got a seat when coming from Termini. Travelling that way felt like you were part of the city life so it had it\u2019s upside also. Anyone who has read any reviews on Rome will be aware already of certain horror stories regarding pickpockets/beggars etc. There\u2019s no doubt that this is a major downside of Rome but simply have your wits about you, know where your wallet is when you are out and about and if you are inclined to give to beggars take a quick look at their shoes before you do as I noticed some very well kept, good quality pairs which was not in keeping with their general attire which made me suspect all was not what it seemed. A couple of general tips would be 1.When going to the Vatican Museums/Sistine Chapel/St Peter's Square get off the Metro at Ottaviano (It's closer to the back of the queue!) but walk an extra 5 minutes and get back on at Cipro as you'll then get a seat! 2.Don't feel the need to get there at the crack of dawn. We went on the day the Sistine Chapel and Museums reopened after the death of JPII and it was also a national holiday and we only waited 45 minutes when starting to queue at 11:15! 3. Take advantage of the FREE English Speaking tours of St Peter's. Our guide was very enthusiastic and informative and although one aim of the tour is to get you to follow up and pay for a tour of the Sistine Chapel immediately afterwards you can do what we did (although others didn\u2019t) and simply tip the guide at the end. 4.Pay the extra 10 euros and get an English speaking guide at the Colloseum (I would recommend Maximillian's). This beats the queue, takes you around the Roman Forum also and if, like Max, they are a native of the city their passion for the place is evident. 5.If checking out of your hotel some time before departing Rome leave your bags in the Hotel if possible as the queue for the Left Luggage at Termini was insanely long and it was quicker to take the return bus journey and pick them back up!!!", "Date": "May 13, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Petaluma, CA", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "TruvilinJoe", "ReviewID": "UR3459935", "Content": "The Sunrise Hotel is clean, affordable, quiet and has a freindly staff.
