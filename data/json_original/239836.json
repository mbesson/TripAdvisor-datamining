That said, this is definitely one of the worst \"high end\" hotels in NYC I have ever stayed at, and I am a very frequent business and pleasure visitor to NYC. Although the lobby area is grand and ornate, the beauty of this hotel stops on the ground floor. Will not even go into the ongoing construction of apartments in this building and the very ugly exterior entrance. The hotel rooms look as though they have not been touch since the 60's or 70's (and to bolster that claim, just look to the 70's era touch tone phone in the bathroom and the 60's era dial phones in the floor lobby). Furrniture, fixtures and carpet are very shabby for a 4+ star hotel, especially one that was charging my hosts over $600 per night for the privilage. Room was extremely small - Very much felt like a typically \"Holiday Inn\" experience, but without ice or drink machines on any floor (you need to call for everything and they take forever). Although most of the the bell, housekeeping, door and security staff are very pleasant and helpful, this does not translate to the reception, conceirge or room service areas. Phone calls to reception took ages, everything from the drinks to the roqm service menu are terribly overpriced, even by NYC standards. Requested a pack of smokes for a guest to be delivered to the room from the gift shop ($8) and was told upon delivery the charge was $28 !

The service was impeccable. We did not make use of the Butler service except for ice, pillows, towels and other things that housekeeping would normally handle. Every request was fulfilled promptly and most graciously. The room was very large with a spacious sitting area. We arrived about 7AM after taking a red-eye flight. Of course, our room was not available. However, after seeing how tired we were, the management very graciously offered us the use of a small room in the Westin section of the hotel, and arranged to have our bags sent up. We were able to shower and nap until our room was ready. Truly a very gracious gesture on their part, and very much appreciated! This may have been due to our being SPC gold card members. Regardless, it was a lovely thing to do. This hotel gets outstanding marks for service, which was universally outstanding. Everyone at the hotel, reception, concierge, maids, doormen, security, butlers, bellmen, were wonderfully attentive and friendly. They greeted us by name whenever we came or went, freely offered assistance, and truly made us feel welcome. The only negative comment I have is that the bathrooms in the St Regis club rooms do not have the \"heavenly shower\" we experienced in the small Westin room. When I inquired about this, I was told that this was not provided by the St Regis Club rooms, only in the Westin. What a mistake that is!! The heavenly shower was without a doubt the best shower I have ever experienced in a hotel, anywhere. The shower in our St Regis club room was just barely acceptable. It leaked due to the seal having long since worn away, so that every shower led to a flood on the marble floor. The bed, however, was extremely comfortable. We did miss having a menu of pillows from which to choose. The St Regis club offered only 2 choices: foam or down, neither of which were quite right for us. It makes no sense to me that the Westin rooms offer more amenities than the St Regis Club rooms. However, the room was wonderful and extremely quiet. We ate at Botanica, which was lovely if expensive. The food was excellent and beautifully prepared. The spa locker rooms were disappointingly bare bones. The massage I had was wonderful. But you got only one small towel in your locker. No washcloths, no extra towels. Considering the prices, this is unacceptable. There is a lovely shop, called R. N. Joseph Fine Art, that is filled with paintings and exquisite furnishings and works of art, as well as estate jewelery. Although expensive, the offerings were exceptional. We ended up purchasing 3 paintings! The location of the hotel could not be better. Central Park South, within walking distance to 5th Ave, the theatre district, all sorts of shopping and restaurants. Easy access to subway, and of course, Central park.

This is an old building, and the rooms are comfortable and, in some instances, stunningly large for the city. It is a profound value proposition. We paid about $340/night for a large King with a very spacious sitting area. Not bad for prime position on Central Park South, a block from the spectacular new Time Warner Building on Columbus Circle, a block-and-a-half from Fifth Avenue, 2 blocks from the N/R/W/Q subway line, and a short walk from Times Square. And staying at the St. Regis Club means sharing the Essex House lobby, which offers a great brunch in Botanica as well the sublime haute cuisine of Alain Ducasse. It seems a forgone conclusion to me that this gracious building will disappear into the arms of condo development in the not-too-distant future, following in the footsteps of The Plaza and the Inter-Continental Central Park...It's just that the address on Central Park South is far more valuable for residences than for hotels. It's all quite sad, really, since there is no better place to stay that on Central Park South and the Essex House allows you to do it at a fairly reasonable price and in a wonderful sense of style and comfort.", "Date": "September 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tucson, AZ", "Title": "\u201cCompletely satisfied\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3531803", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the St. Regis Club for the first time for six nights in May.

Here are the good features: The hotel is attractive and the rooms are comfortable and well-appointed, with pleasant decor that has a solid feeling. The staff is well-trained to be polite and gracious. The location is superb (central park, theater district, shopping). Here is what is not so great: The fitness room is mediocre. (For example, I like quality elliptical trainers and this gym has only two old-fashioned ones that are not in good working condition.) There is a scent that is spread in the air in the fitness room that they presumably think makes it smell good, but it is an irritant. Fresh air would be preferable. They have the temerity to charge a $10 fee per day for use of this subpar facility on top of the expensive room rates. The fitness center opens late on weekends, so people who are on business trips do not have time to exercise if they want to get to work on time. If the quality of the fitness center is important to you, this is not the hotel for you. Also, when I went to the concierge for assistance in finding a gym for early Saturday morning, he only checked one facility that opened even later than the one at the Essex house and then said forget about it. I would suggest there was not much interest in meeting my need. When I asked him about a specific gym in another hotel on a nearby street, he ignored the question. I had to call around the city on my own to find a solution. On the higher floors of the hotel, the entire size of the floor is small, so that it is difficult to escape the noise of the elevators. Also annoying is the snobbery associated with room assignments. I am an average dumpy-looking, but well-groomed, 50 year old woman (and a physician who is a national expert in my field and award winning professor) and when I travel, most desk clerks automatically assign me to a less desirable room than they would someone they consider more important. My experience at this hotel was no different than usual. I am disappointed about this. I am waiting for a hotel in which people are assigned rooms based upon their preferences, the date of the reservation and the amount they are paying rather than the reaction of a 25-year old desk clerk to how they look and whether this clerk considers the guest worthy. In fact, when I made a specific request to be away from the elevators and the clerk said she had a perfect room for me, it turned out to be right next to the elevator- it was impossilbe to be any closer to it without actually being in it.", "Date": "December 6, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cgood & cramped in manhattan\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2453081", "Content": "Being from LA I would think this is wayyyy to expensive for the little suites you get but by Manhattan New York city standards this is class all the way!
