In this case, Homewood Suites is close to the Toronto airport, less than 10 minutes' drive on the free shuttle. It's not walking distance -- few airport hotels are -- and as the name (\"Corporate Centre\") says it's not a place if you want to be in a nightlife hotspot, either. But if you're looking for a place to overnight on the way to the airport, on the way back, or on an overnight connection, the Homewood Suites is a great choice. The hotel is on Eglinton West, next door to a Hampton Inn, convenient to Hwy 401. Parking is free, unlike many airport hotels, and stay-and-fly packages (allowing you to leave your car while on your trip and pick it up on your return) are well-priced. The hotel is relatively new and quite well-maintained, with spotless lobby areas and rooms. The Homewood Suites-standard rooms provide for a sitting area as well as a bedroom (studio suites combine the two in one room), with a flat-screen TV in each room. The bathrooms are modern and clean, and there is a kitchenette with a refrigerator and basic cooking facilities. The hotel is far enough from both the airport and the highway for the rooms to be quiet. The hotel provides a breakfast as well, but our flight left too early for us to be able to check that out -- typically Homewood Suites breakfasts are at the upper end of the free hotel breakfast scale, though.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Thomas, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely stay here!\u201d", "Author": "Owen87", "ReviewID": "UR124911535", "Content": "My wife and I were given tickets to the Jerry D comedy show (which was amazing) and we stayed overnight at this hotel.

This was my first stay at this hotel. Here is my impression: Hotel facility: New, a 7 storey building with everything one might need for a comfortable stay (free wifi, well equipped business center, gym, pool, laundry facility, breakfast, shuttle service, even a simple dinner is provided Mon-Thurs evenings). Overall impression: Excellent. Staff: Everyone I encountered was friendly and accommodating. Overall impression: Excellent. Rooms: We had a one bedroom suite. It had a full kitchen, living room, large bedroom and huge bathroom. Two TVs. Pleasant decor and comfortable beds. Overall impression: Excellent. Food: The included breakfast was ample with both hot and cold choices and a self serve waffle station. One minor beef was that the plastic jugs used for milk and juice really didn't keep them cold. I can live with juice that isn't ice cold, but tepid milk isn't the greatest. I didn't take advantage of the free dinner, but took a look and thought it was more than adequate (soup, small salad bar, and a daily hot choice - beef stew and rice when I visited). The weekly menu roation is posted on the fridge in the room. Juices and soft drinks were provided (apparently wine and beer is available at an extra charge). Large trays are provided in the rooms for guests who want to retrieve food to take back to their suites - nice touch. There is a coffee/tea station in the lobby that is accessible 24 hours a day, which was also handy (no it isn't coffee house quality, but it is included). There isn't a full service restaurant or bar in the hotel. Overall impression of the food: Pretty darned good considering it is provided as part of the hotel rate. The dining area (which is just off the lobby) is open and inviting. Location: While close to the airport, this hotel is not directly on the usual airport strip. As a result, relatively few planes fly over the hotel, making it fairly quiet. The airport is accessible via service roads, making it unnecessary to go onto the major roads which can, in my experience, get clogged with traffic depending on the time of day. Driving time to the airport is about 10 minutes. The hotel is on the same property as a Hampton Inn, other than that I didn't notice many hotels immediately nearby. The area is a bit stark. It is mostly populated with warehouse type buildings, although there are some restaurants within walking distance, including a lovely Irish pub with decent food and a nice atmosphere a 5 minute walk from the hotel (and near that is a bowling center, of all things). The shuttle driver informed me that guests may request a shuttle to any location within a few miles, which makes shopping centers, a movie theater, and many other restaurants a possibility. Overall impression: A warehouse strip (not exactly pretty), but the things most travelers need aren't far away. Value: I thought the rates were very reasonable, particularly considering all of the inclusions. The hotel also offers a stay and park option which includes one hotel night, up to 8 nights of parking, and airport shuttle transportation. A great pre-vacation option. Overall impression: Excellent. Summary: In my opinion, anyone looking for a Toronto Airport Hotel should seriously consider this hotel. I recommend it highly.", "Date": "January 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Windsor, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Property and Outstanding Service\u201d", "Author": "Rick O", "ReviewID": "UR122628295", "Content": "The Homewood Suites on Eglington Ave is truly a wonderful experience.

We only payed $150 with tax for a night here and this is a very nice hotel. You can tell this hotel is newer as it still had that new smell. Check in was a breeze and our room was very clean and large. We went swimming that night and the pool area is very nice and so is the gym. We asked for shuttle service at 7am the next day and at 7am there was a shuttle waiting to take us to the airport. For the price we paid we were able to leave our vehicle at the hotel as well. The only negative thing I could say about this hotel was when we came back from the trip on Christmas night we called after we got out luggage to have the shuttle come pick us back up and we were told someone would be there in 15 minutes to get is. I called back 30 minutes later as the shuttle still had not arrived and was told he would be there shortly. For the time we waited for the shuttle I noticed a Comfort Inn shuttle van come by 3 times while we waited. When we did get picked up at Terminal one he said he had to check Terminal 3 for someone. There was no one there. On our way to the hotel the driver got a speakerphone call from someone at the hotel who sounded pissed off and told the driver he needed to go back to Terminal one to get someone else, by this time we were more then halfway to the hotel so he told the women on the phone it wasn't a good time to talk and that he would be at the hotel in a couple of minutes.

The full sized refrigerator is great to store everything and having a separate climate control for the bedroom is a really nice feature.

Homewood is a great choice because of their 2 queen bed plus sofabed suites. We were greeted right at the doors by staff, check-in was efficient and friendly, room was clean and quiet (at the end of the hallway). We arrived rather late after working all day (9pm), a little surprised we seemed to be in the \"boonies\" - not much closeby in terms of restaurants and such. Very close to LBP Airport (right off the 401), yet we didn't once hear any planes flying overhead when we were in our room nor any highway traffic, even at nighttime. Everything in our room was sufficient, two minor criticisms would be: fan in bathroom runs 24/7, can be quite noisy at nighttime; the a/c units are also quite loud - generally the sound would not bother us during the night, but these seemed particularly loud and everyone commented on disturbed sleep. Not a deal breaker, just seemed odd. Everyone was happy with breakfast: Morning 1 had veg. and western omelets, sausage, potato patties as the hot fare, along with the usual waffle iron, bagels, bread, muffins, pastries, fresh fruit/salad, yogurt, cereal, etc. etc. Morning 2 offered western omelets (guess they weren't a hit the first day), turkey bacon, Tater Tots, and hard boiled eggs plus all the usuals. Area was kept very clean and well stocked. Lots of tables for eating, we were pretty surprised because the parking lot was packed, yet hardly anyone at breakfast when we were there. Pool is sufficient for a casual swim/kids. Again, we were the only ones in the pool. No hot tub. Check-out was also very efficient. A comment about the staff: our teenaged daughters both commented that every time we walked past a staff member, they always smiled and acknowledged us (Good Morning, how are you, hello there, etc.) Very professional and courteous without being sugary and overbearing. The location of the hotel is a little far from downtown Toronto, but we knew that going in.

We had a lovely experience in January, which was why we made reservations for a one-bedroom suite at this hotel when planning a trip to see our favorite artist, Josh Groban, in concert at the Air Canada Centre, and the Labatt Center in London, ON. We planned two nights here in Toronto, and made reservations for a 3rd night in London so we wouldn't have so far to drive after the concert. Upon check-in we were informed that since we were a large family (four adults - my husband, myself, and my adult son and daughter) we'd been given a comp. upgrade to a TWO-bedroom, TWO bathroom suite. One look at the suite we'd been given and we asked if we could extend our stay by one night! Upon verifying that we'd be able to do so, we canceled our reservations for London (sorry, London!), and settled in for a three-night stay in what I have to say is THE nicest hotel suite we have EVER had the pleasure of staying in! The suite was spacious, impeccably clean, and quiet. The kitchen was well-equipped for our purposes - a couple of light meals taken in the room instead of eating out. At some hotels, we've had all we can do to get one set of towels apiece, but here there were plenty of towels made available, more than enough extra blankets in the closet (which may seem rather odd, considering Toronto was in the midst of an historic heat wave!), and all the customarily supplied items were there in sufficient quantity. The front desk staff was gracious and friendly, very helpful and unfailingly polite, as were the housekeepers. We encountered no problems during our stay, but if we had I have no doubt they would have been dealt with quickly and satisfactorily. The SuiteStart complimentary breakfast was among the best we've encountered at any of the Homewood Suites. Everything was fresh and well prepared. The first morning we were there, my husband and I went down during the last hour of breakfast (8:00 - 9:00) to have our own breakfast, and get something to bring up to our son and daughter, who were still too tired to go down with us. Things were a bit chaotic, as there seemed to be a large group of guests - all related - that had descended upon the dining area en masse. The breakfast staff had, perhaps, a little difficulty keeping up with their demands, especially in the area of the bread, bagel and pastry display. Almost as soon as the supply was replenished, there was a rush on the display. (One young man in particular, dressed in his jammie bottoms, seemed to be in a perpetual holding pattern, hovering over the pastry display.) This went on until long after the official closing time for breakfast. The staff had to finally turn off the light in the serving area to signal that breakfast was over. We were more amused than annoyed at the chaos, the only drawback being that the rest of our party didn't have much of a selection of pastries brought up to them. But that was a small thing, and wasn't really the fault of the kitchen staff. And despite the added pressure of the rush, the staff was very polite and attentive. The second and third mornings were much smoother, and there was an adequate supply of everything. The fresh fruit bowl was a favorite! All in all, we had a wonderful stay at the Toronto Airport Homewood Suites, and we will definitely be coming back any time we are in Ontario province!", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Greenfield, IN", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "GreenfieldMom6", "ReviewID": "UR115482012", "Content": "We stayed here with our teen-age children for 3 nights.

My husband had a conference to attend at the International Centre, and my 2 year old son and I were tagging along for leisure purposes. My first question was if they have a shuttle to the International Centre. They said yes, absolutely. The second question was if we could reserve a room that had a door separating the bedroom from the living room (so our son could sleep and we didn't have to go to bed at 8 pm along with him). Again, they said yes. They quoted a rate that gave me $189/night for 2 nights, and $129/night for the third night. When we arrived at the hotel, we were told our rate was $189 for all THREE nights. I told them it was supposed to be $129 for the third night and I was asked to provide proof of this. Thankfully I had my iPhone with me and could call up the email on it that had the confirmation (just having the confirmation NUMBER was not enough). Once I showed them the email, the change was made - but I feel that I should not have had to do that - what if I didn't have access to my email on my phone? The girl who chcked us in was very nice about it, but I felt frustrated by the situation. When we checked into our room, we did not get a room that had a separate door. I called the front desk and apparently they did not have that request on the reservation, and they were not able to accommodate our request that evening. They said we would be able to switch rooms the next day, but I would have to be at the hotel 'sometime in the afternoon' to make the switch. I also inquired about scheduling the shuttle for my husband to the International Centre, and was told \"No, we don't go there - it's too far\" (despite being told previously that they could take us there, and despite it being literally right beside the airport). I protested, telling them that we were told it would be fine, and they agreed to take him. The room switch went well, but was frustrating that I had to do it in the first place. No discount/rebate was offered, but the hotel did send up a small gift bag with some snacks in it for the inconvenience. The first night, my husband called me 30 minutes after he was scheduled to be picked up by the shuttle, saying that they had not shown up. I left my dinner and went back to the hotel to see what happened. I asked the girl at the front desk if someone was on their way, and she said no. She didn't really offer an explanation or much of an apology - but she did offer to send someone right away. By this time, they were an hour late, and it takes about 15-20 minutes to get there. I declined and went to pick him up myself. For the remainder of the trip, I called the hotel half an hour before he was scheduled to be picked up to remind them to get him. We requested a late check-out, which we were told was just fine. They said we could check out at 3 pm. At 12, a member of the cleaning staff knocked on our door and said we should have checked out already. We told her about the late checkout and she said she had no mention of it, but did not protest it. Upon leaving, I called the front desk to ask for a bellman to come up and help with our luggage, and the girl seriously did not understand what I was asking for (to be clear, someone to bring up a cart and help us bring everything down). A maintenance person showed up with a cart but left right away. That is the end of the \"cons\" of our stay. I felt very frustrated at the lack of communication between the person who took our reservation and what ended up happening (to be clear, I called the actual hotel to make the reservation - not just the 1-800 number). I also felt that really, we should have been compensated for the mistakes that were made (past the small bag of snacks - which was nice, but kind of insulting). To be fair, I didn't ask for compensation, but it should have been offered. The staff were all very nice throughout the issues, and in some cases, apologetic (but not at all apologetic in others). The \"pros\": The rooms were very nicely appointed, clean and comfortable. It was wonderful to have the kitchenettes - especially when you're travelling with a little one. The cleaning staff were excellent - even loading and running the dishwasher for me (which I didn't expect them to do). The hotel breakfast was excellent each day - Gee is one of the friendliest people I've ever met! We did not get to experience the hotel dinner, but the menu sounded good.

What separates great hotels from good ones is the small things and attention to detail, she could have taken my credit card, given me my room key and quickly moved on to something else, but took notice of where I was heading, what the conditions were and handed me the umbrella.

Mahreesh (sp?) a manager there offered to keep their dinner service open a little longer for us, but we didnt want to trouble them and figured stuffed green peppers and scallopped potatoes may not be a hit with the kids (even though it smelled pretty good to me!). Mahreesh then suggested to us a number of restaurants he thought would be worth visiting (we went with a very nice Italian place a few lights up Eglinton). The rest of our stay was wonderful, with the staff reccomending various places to visit and see in Toronto since this was our first visit. We took advantage of their breakfast every morning and enjoyed the wide assortment of items. As mentioned, the hotel itself is located near the airport which is to the west of the downtown Toronto area. I had a morning meeting there and was told traffic would be pretty brutal.
