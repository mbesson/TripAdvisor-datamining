The staircases seems to have been recently recarpeted, and the hallway/staircase looks fairly nice although there was some construction equipment (e.g., ladder) in the hallways. It was rather off-putting to find signs like this in the hallway: \"Do not put clothes in the toilet....\" And \"Don't leave rubbish in the hallways.\" There was no real sense of hospitality, which shows in the signage. The laundry room (washer/dryer) was also poorly signed; it noted 2 pounds for 30 minutes of wash, but then didn't explain that the washer requires much more time than that. The bed was firm, and there was adequate closet and storage space. Wireless internet was very reliable. In the studio, there is a small dining table and two plastic chairs. There is no artwork whatsoever or any decorate pillows to give the room a brightening effect. The kitchen was adequate although the lack of markers on the range/oven (hob) made cooking rather mysterious and trial & error. The dishware and cutlery were sufficient although barely. No Tee towels, so we bought one as well as paper towels. We also had to purchase toilet paper as it was not readily supplied. The TV was adequate although it is hung fairly low on the wall, and it's easy to run into as a result. The bathroom is small. There is no elevator, and our room was on top floor, so it was a hike with or without suitcases. Our main complaint, though, was that we had booked through London Choice, which did not send the credit through, and as a result, we paid twice for the studio, even though London Choice's agent when called, promised an immediate refund. In spite of daily communication, no refund was forthcoming. Queensway a block over has a lot of grocery stores (recommend an inexpensive flower bouquet to brighten the room!) and ethnic restaurants (again adequate but not extraordinary). Several of the businesses note that \"professional bag thieves operate in this area,\" so do be warned about the neighborhood, which is mixed--can be very nice and also touristy (which attracts thieves).

We needed to be in the centre and unfortunately went for Hyde Park Economy Apartments in a rush without really looking at the reviews. As soon as it was confirmed I immediately regretted it but then I tried to reassure myself by thinking \"surely it can't be that bad, can it?\". I wouldn't consider myself a snob, anyway. I've no shame opting for cheap and basic accommodation because I believe that budget shouldn't necessarily mean bad. This however, was TERRIBLE. Convent location but so not worth the money. We were put in one of the basement rooms and it was a veritable sauna despite being below ground level, the heating switched off and being in London at the end of September. When we tried to open the window, we found was a broken sash that wouldn't stay open. The blinds were also hanging a good 10 inches from the bottom of the window with slats either broken or missing, and seeing as there were no curtains either, it meant we had little to no privacy. So... Good start. Stifling air, no privacy... What next? The studio was in a pretty poor state. Most of the furniture was either broken or damaged, even handles came off the cupboards. Nothing was properly cleaned either, dust was everywhere and the toilet was pretty disgusting too. The shower wouldn't stay one temperature for more than 10 seconds either, switching from boiling hot to ice cold or lukewarm and back again. The television's speakers cracked every minute or so and you don't get anything complimentary there. We had two very flat pillows on the bed and a duvet. No flat sheet, no extras, you get what you're given. It was so sticky and uncomfortable in the room that we had to take the duvet out, use the cover as a sheet, fold up the duvet and use it as a pillow. Oh, best of all - bedbugs. Glorious bedbugs. That says it all, really. I'd reiterate what others have said about reception, the inconvenience, there is no excuse. I've seen this advertised as a 3-4* hotel which couldn't be farther from the truth. I've stayed in much better no star hostels. They're obviously doing some renovations but they're purely superficial so when you peek through the entrance or go to the reception down the road you think \"oh, this is nice!\" but when you accept your keys and turn the corner you'll find rotten carpets, doors that slam and paper thin walls and ceiling. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Not even for a night. Noisy. Dirty. Falling apart.

The cab dropped us off at 11 Inverness Terrace but found out reception was actually two blocks away and had to drag all our luggage down there. We were given a room in no. 11 which looked ok from the outside but was truly scary on the inside. There were lots of dodgy people loitering in the entrance hall and stairwells, an ear-splitting party going on in the basement and ground floor flats, and acres of stairwells which we had to carry our luggage up. Or rather, one of the pimps loitering in the hallway carried up the stairwell for us. At the top of the stairs it was pitch black, no lighting so had to feel our way through the rabbit warren to our room. More parties were going on upstairs, babies were crying in the rooms across the hall... then we opened our door. Our room was filthy - I was too scared to touch anything because there were suspicious looking stains on everything, the two single \"beds\" were more like a couple of ancient mattresses thrown into an alcove with a couple of yellowed bed sheets (and also with suspicious looking stains) and the room was boiling with no air con. The \"view\" was of the garbage area and the back of the flats opposite. To open the windows I had to stand on the kitchen bench and reach up (thankfully i'm tall), but some were broken and kept closing. The only thing that came through the open windows was the stink of 20 people smoking in the basement flat below and the stench of garbage. The bathroom was filthy and miniscule, and even though I was ready to collapse there was NO WAY I was going within a 10km radius of those beds. We lugged our bags back down the stairs past the drug dealers and hookers and back down the street to reception. We jumped up and down and demanded a refund or a room that was fit for human habitation. We told the receptionist about the drug dealers and hookers in the hallways and the parties going on, and he just shrugged his shoulders and said that \"well, even if you were in a five-star hotel you can't guarantee there won't be prostitutes staying there\". Wrong answer, mate. We were prepared to lose all our money (which naturally had to be paid in advance and is non refundable) and stay somewhere else, but it was getting on midnight and we were both ready to collapse from exhaustion. After a huge argument with this bloke and his supervisor who kept telling us that they were absolutely fully booked, they caved in and gave us the keys to another apartment down the road to look at. This was in no 81 - the ground floor flat. It was a vast improvement - it still needed a clean, but it looked like it had been recently renovated and was at least livable (it was the flat that they show on their website). The supervisor told us he was doing us a huge favour, because this flat was much more expensive than the one we'd booked and we really should be paying more to stay there, so we asked him why he had photos of the more expensive flats on the internet when in reality the ones you get are cess pits. We were constantly worried that they'd charge our credit card because we were in the \"deluxe\" room (they keep you card number on file) but thankfully they didn't. The staff were rude when we checked out. Oh, and the apartments are definitely not serviced. No beds get made, no linen gets changed, no bathrooms get stocked - nothing. We also told them that we had no cutlery in the apartment and they said they'd send someone right over. No one ever came and we had to go buy some cutlery from Tescos so we could eat. We read these reviews after we'd booked but thought it couldn't possibly be this bad. It wasn't - it was far, far worse than we could ever have imagined. Please, do not give these crooks the money and the business. They should be shut down. How the hell they're even operating god only knows.

Bed was absolutely appaling in terms of comfort (so was the sofa), also the bed was loud when moving the slightest bit, during the night temperature was way too high and had not air con. The walls and room were very dirty. A dirty cooking tray was left in the oven. Bathroom was generally clean, shower worked perfect that was the best part of the room. Kitchen table was incredibly small and had massive bumps and marks in the paint. Not enough cutlary and kitchen ware. Other than all of that... the location was absolutely perfect (very close to bayswater and queensway) down the road from hyde park also and a short walk to paddington station. Has cinema, bowling, restaurants, tesco express and metro, cash machine, shopping centre (whiteleys).

Location is excellent with tube right nearby and tesco direct to fuel a picnic in the park really good. The room was geared for 3 had to ask for extra bedding cups, plates and towels and they knew from the booking we were a party of 5, hairdryer broke and you could actually go onto the balcony and break into your own apartment, the apartment was dirty the bed linen was clean but it smelt musty. This in itself was enough but went for Lebonese meal on high street and through the night kids were sick, yet again not within our capabilities but to phone housekeeping so we could mop floor after initial clear up and change towles, they did not respond for the whole of our 4 day stay until the final morning when they knocked at 9.15 to ask to be in for an 11am dept time... classic. Room red hot and no air con, you could not have patio doors open as they were open to a balcony all along the row. The worst was the noise. You are in London we were out from 9.30 till 11 with the kids to pack in the tourist bit but we were next to loud families and they would not open door so resorted to banging on wall at 1am and then again at 6am when children playing ball in the room, they did not speak English and reception did not want to know. We actually thought they were in all day so wondered if they were hostled there. It was like being next to a childminding gymnasium. If you get similar price book hotel with reception and a means of support. The management seem so far removed that they do not care and the next wave of foriegn travellers are next in so it does not matter. This is a first time as complainer as I normally use my tent so you can see I am used to roughing it but this went to far...

It was just what I needed as a single traveler. I went to the grocery store nearby and picked up some essentials and saved a load of money by not eating out. The bedding was clean as was the bathroom. A 2 minute walk down the street had you through the gates into Kensington/Hyde Park and and the Queensway subway station..perfect location for a quick tube ride to Oxford Street, Trafalgar Square, Big Ben, West Minister Abbey etc. The only negatives about where I stayed were: the floor creaked in a certain spot (who cares?), one of the tiles was a bit loose in the bathroom (again, who cares?), the tv had only one english channel available but I was too tired by the time I returned to the room every night I didn't care to watch tv and there is no elevator in the building. So when you first arrive and when you check out, you've got to lug your luggage down the stairs, and being on the third floor as I was, it sucked but it wouldn't be enough to discourage me from coming here again.

The staff at check-in was friendly but a bit unorganized.

Our apartment had a laminate floor, a pretty spacious and fully equipped kitchen (stove with oven, fridge, microwave, toaster, electrical water cooker, coffee maker, cooking equipment, dishes, cutlery etc.), a comfortable double bed, one bedside table, a small table with two chairs, a flat screen TV with 4 channels (very bad reception), a large cupboard with hangers, an iron and ironing board, a really tiny bathroom with a toilet, washbasin, mirror and a shower. What we liked best: - conveniently located within short walking distance to 3 underground lines + to Hyde Park and Kensington Park - lots of grocery stores, pubs and restaurants on Queensway + surroundings (please don't try the Indian buffet on Iverness terrace!) - kitchen to be able to prepare breakfast and cool beverages - low rate What we liked least: - building rubble in hallway (from ground floor renovations) - neglected and dirty stairways - dust in the room (corners, massive on the window) - mould in the bathroom (ceiling, walls due to missing ventilation) - no sockets in bathroom (e.g. for hair dryer) - no lights next to the bed for bed time reading All in all it was pretty okay for the low rate we paid but I am sure that we are willing to spent more to get more comfort and cleanliness next time.

The apartment was located on a third floor (no lift of course, but I already knew about it). I walked into my room, and I could not believe what I saw. Old, dirty-stained sheets. A broken sofa. In general it was one of the most depressing rooms I have seen in my life. On top of that, during my first night tons of cockroaches showed up, and I thought I was going to get a heart attack. They were basically everywhere. I went to the reception the next day, and said I would not stay in that room for another day. I was then told that this is a common thing in London, and because they were fully booked they could not offer me a different apartment. I asked for a refund, and was told that this is not possible. As I did not want to spend more money on my accommodation, I was made to stay in this horrible apartment with cockroaches every night. You would assume, that that is enough for one stay.

I was told that if I do not pay it at that point, they will remove all my belongings. I went to the reception with the gentleman. The poor guy at the desk tried to call his manager, who apparently was not available at that point. I have heard him saying that the bailiff came again. Which only proves, that this company does not even pay any bills. I would not be surprised if one of the guests was actually asked to pay for their bills. Horrible experience.
