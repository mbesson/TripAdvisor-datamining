It is located in the heart of Dubai...two huge 50-storied towers right in the middle of Sh. Zayed Road! You have a number of restaurants and pubs all around you on both sides of Sh. Zayed Road. The suite we stayed in was really amazing. It was divided into a kitchen area and the bedroom area. The kitchen was well equipped with absolutely everything that you would need right from making noodles to cooking a five course dinner.The bedroom was quite cozy and you can even dim the lights using a master remote that controls most things in the room. The hotel has a number of amenities in the room...all the usual ones and some unique ones like a scented candle and an incense stick. The hotel has a rooftop swimming pool and you have a breathtaking view of the entire city from up there. Angsana Spa is considered to be one of the best in Dubai for its variety of massage therapies. I didn't actually eat at the hotel restaurant mainly because of the abundance of eateries all around. Another good thing about the location is its proximity to the two major shopping malls in Dubai, The Dubai Mall and Mall of the Emirates. So if you are bored in the room you can just hop over to Dubai Mall where you can literally spend an entire day. All in all, a wonderful place to stay at.

I am a frequent traveler to Dubai, and having stayed in other hotels, I can compare to what I saw elsewhere. Angsana is definitely the worst by far - the rooms are incredibly small compared to same priced and supposedly same service elsewhere (if you want a One bedroom apartment, check Somerset: Same price, and rooms 3 times as big - the staff is the most incompetent and unfriendly I have had to deal with. An example would be when I came back one day and found out that an item of mine was missing. I had to speak to at least 10 people, who would eventually be very affirmative in telling me that they did not loose anything, and would refuse to pass me to their manager even after asking 5 times. An example of incompetency would be how poor the cleaning of my room is done every day: If I do not think of putting a used glass in the sink, it would stay dirty as it is on my bedside table, or if I leave a trunk in the bathroom, I would find it hanged with the face towels instead of in the bedroom. I could also cite the time when I gave a suite to the cleaning and when they called me at 11.30pm to ask if it was a right time to bring it back, or the time when I requested breakfast at 7.30am, and the kitchen woke me up at 6am to apologize they did not have Frosties and wanted to know if I was fine with Chocopops (What the hell???). Not to tell the time where I put a Do not Disturb on the door and that someone knocked the door and in a gasp entered the room. I did not have the time to react or say anything after the knock and he was already in while I was naked off the shower. This did not seem to bother him as he barely apologized. I have enough stories like that to write a full book on hospitality services. - The lift are simply the worst I have seen in my life: As experienced by other guests here, you could be waiting sometimes up to 20 minutes, and see lifts passing by your floor both up and down and not stopping. Basically, if you are planning on meeting someone at the reception, better plan on taking the elevator at least 15 minutes in advance, and there will still be good chance you will be late. Also, prepare yourself to meet with as many staff in the elevator as there are guests in the whole hotel. Every time I take the elevator, I have to prepare myself to meet with at least a dozen staff, both in the corridors of my floor (why would there be almost permanently 5 or 6 staff walking around doing this and that on a floor where there are only 10 rooms?), and in the elevator (the architect must have forgotten to put elevators for staff in his blue prints. Consequently, you would ALWAYS meet staff in the elevator with various cleaning items. Ultimately, you will end up with the feeling you are actually disturbing them. As stated here by others, even if at the time I write this review the hotel has been open for more than 6 months, no taxi seem to know what or where it is. This is mainly due to how bad designed is the entrance (the hotel is indeed on Shekh Zayed road (main road of Dubai), but the entrance is hidden on the behind, inside the parking. Nothing on the roadside indicates what the building is and that it is actually in use. The direct result is that you would need to walk cab drivers to the hotel every time, and people coming to visit you will have difficulties to find the place. Really: Don\u2019t go to Angsana. There are loads of apartment hotels and hotels in Dubai, plenty much better on any possible criteria in the same price range. I though that Maroj Rotana was the worst in Dubai and the world before I can here, but I found that Angsana did so bad that I think it would really be impossible to anyone even trying to do worse.", "Date": "January 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barcelona, SPAIN", "Title": "\u201cGood Experience!\u201d", "Author": "Javier_A_Puig", "ReviewID": "UR21925550", "Content": "UPS - Excellent room, with big plasma TV, DVD player, FREE OF CHARGE wireless connection, complete kitchen with fridge for a whole family, microwave, coffee machine, washing machine, etc - Excellent Food at Room Service - Nice and efficient Staff, always ready to help - Location near the Exhibition Center, Financial Centre.

But I have to say that the couple's massage we received at the Spa was the most unique. It was just perfect.

Sure its brand new and is clean and smells fresh, however thats about where the good points end. The furnishings and fittings in the room whilst modern, are very ikea like, with hard uncomfortable lounges and cheap lino floors (which I believe expand and contract making loud noises during the night). The hotel is very difficult to get to (you need to keep doubling back through construction sites until you get to the hotel entrance). In the Dubai traffic it takes a very long time to arrive (as you can't access it directly from Sheik Zayed Road even though thats where it is located. On check in, there were almost a dozen reception staff hanging around the front desk, but even this multitude of staff couldn't seem to manage the check out of 2 guests and my check in. I kept being asked to sit down whilst waiting for service (so after the 4th offer from as many reception staff, I finally agreed). The lift to take me to my room took about 8 minutes to arrive (which I found out later was a good period in the scheme of things - they usually take much longer). My bag took 45 minutes to find its way to my room, it was only due to the ordeal of having struggled to make it there and check in ordeal that I didn't have the energy to phone and complain. In the morning, the lift took 15 minutes (some of them I could see where either resting on floors or stuck) others kept zooming up and down past me but none seeming to want to stop at my floor (which was only half way up the building - I perish the thought of staying anywhere near the top!) On return to my room one day, it hadn't been cleaned at all and my key wouldn't work. So after waiting for a long time for a lift to go up, then down again I was told by the reception staff that I should wait until the key registers. I explained that I know when a key does and doesn't work and this one doesn't work as the light flashed red instead of green. I then took the 15 minute wait for a ride elevator back up to my room. All in all, don't stay here unless you like staying in the middle of a construction zone, in a place that takes you way too long to get to, with inefficient facilities and inefficient staff.

My wife and I had a wonderful and relaxing Spa treatment and we are looking forward to enjoy it when we have our first chance to go back, many thanks to the very professional Spa staff. The only thing that was not up to our expectation was the heat and humidity which did not allow us to enjoy the open air pool on the rooftop.
