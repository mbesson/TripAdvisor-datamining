{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great friendly service We had a great 5 night stay here with our 2 children (aged 5 and 7) in a 1-4 person EcoSuite. The room was spacious and very clean. Reception staff were extremely friendly and helpful, they gave me assistance when needed eg booking train tickets through RENFE and calling the local tourist information centre.Restaurant and cleaning staff were also amazingly friendly.As the hotel is not on the main road we found it very quiet.The bathroom was very clean and had extra space in a shelf under the basin for all my clutter.The four of us and our suit cases and bags fitted comfortably into the room and the desk was large enough to hold the TV and 2 children sitting and colouring in.It was a 8 minute walk up to the closest metro and about 12 - 15 minutes (and stops) into the centre of Madrid.There is a Cafeteria that does great chocolate and churros just past the metro station (La Cocktelera) and is cheaper than in the hotel restaurant. I got the wrong impression from their website when booking the room. The site says that the suite has a living room and a bedroom, however it is really just one large room (the bedroom has a virtual wall!)The 'household implements' the site referred to were 3 coffee cups and a couple of water glasses. When I asked about this I was told to request them from the restaurant and got some plates and crockery, however we had nothing to wash them up with and on one occasion they were taken away by the cleaner and not replaced.The kingsize bed was actually 2 single beds (made up separately) and pushed together - but it was very comfortable. The kids slept on the sofa bed and were fine but as an adult I found it very uncomfortable to lie on and wouldn't have slept well on it.Regardless of these reservations I would thoroughly recommend Eco Alcala Suites (and have already done so to a good friend) to anyone looking for clean, quiet, quality, affordable accomodation in Madrid.", "Date": "Nov 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR621635937", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "pigandtoad"}, {"Content": "Wow factor Huge room, well kitted out.

Staff were extremely friendly and helpful, hotel lovely but very quiet, we felt like the only guests most of the time. Room extremely spacious, lots of storage space, lovely little kitchen area with a big fridge, espresso machine with coffee pods, microvave and seating area. Could definately have stayed longer. Also the hotel had a gorgeous outdoor seating area attached to the bar, the weather was beautiful when we were there and it was just lovely coming back and sitting outside for a drink.Location really nice, away from the centre and the frenzy in a suburb but it was not short of shops and restaurants and was much cheaper than the centre. Public transport system excellent so no problem getting into the centre, around 20 minutes to Gran Via and metros are very frequent.", "Date": "Apr 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR942910543", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Clarabellinda"}, {"Content": "Great Value While slightly out of the way of popular tourist attractions, the value for the money far exceeds any costs associated with distance to the center of the city.It is very convenient to taxis and public transportation (Metro stop: Ciudad Lineal).A very small hotel by most in the city (32 rooms), all are suites. The hotel is immaculately clean. The staff is well versed in city attractions, directions, and foreign languages. They are consistent in their demeanor, professionalism, and appearance.

But the cleaning tap outside is very noisy! We stayed in this hotel under the understanding that we would have the swimming pool. The pool was closed but this was not the hotels fault as we booked with 1800hotels.com and they said that the hotel had a pool. When we complained they would not accept any liability. Never book on 1800hotels.com they are extremely unmannerly and rude. Anyway back to the hotel. It was only newly opended, and was quite quiet. However the staff were so so so friendly. It was literally unbelievable how friendly they were! They photocopied maps for us, set out our day to warner brothers (like the metro stop to get off at, the rnfe train to get out to there). we also wanted to go to the Hard rock cafe. The young man who was at reception printed out a map for us and stapled on the hard rock phone number. They were so helppful. After a busy day at the city and we were very tired and the lady at reception ordered us a take out from pizza hut and she delivered it to our room with plated and knifes for each one of us. I loved the hotel and would love to have stayed for much longer. The public transport in madrid is excellent and the hotel is a five minute walk from the Ciudad Lineal stop which is really handy. The only bad thing about the hotel is the cleaning room. It was right next door to our room and the tap had us up at 6 o clock every morning. However, the hotel is really really clean and the floors are spotless. Any reviewer that says this hotel is dirty is blind! Really nice hotel!", "Date": "Jan 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR798329908", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "ciaranireland1234"}, {"Content": "Enjoyed our stay Clean room, had a little kitchenette, easy walk to restaurants, pretty close to the airport. I liked also the fact that they used some eco friendly furniture and practices... wish they had a brochure describing everything..The only knock against i s that it was pretty loud (we happened to have loud neighbors up all night partying). The room is definiltely not bulit to be sound proof.. but don't let that deter you from staying here... I lost my camera with all of my pictures from our trip :( and they front desk staff was extremely helpful in trying to help me track it down. They spent a lot of time on it and I am very appreciative (even though I never found it).", "Date": "Sep 30, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR421177946", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "TheSponge8"}, {"Content": "buona soluzione se si decide di non soggiornare in centro   showReview(23046118, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR329393752", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "egon06"}, {"Content": "bello e moderno ma non curato   showReview(21666264, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR875451719", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "germano08"}, {"Content": "Gutes Hotel   showReview(21591359, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR506125747", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "swemix"}, {"Content": "superbe h\u4e48tel r\u8305cent       la chambre", "Date": "Nov 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR260520776", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "mumu1506"}, {"Content": "Lo encontre muy alejado del...   showReview(21324527, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR773350845", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Gern wieder   showReview(20553402, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR944472551", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "bon choix   showReview(19644609, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR465647976", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "h\u4e48tel confortable et bien situ\u8305   showReview(19644610, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR898913715", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Buen Hotel       Habitacion para 3 Personas", "Date": "Jul 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR654005520", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Britanico31"}, {"Content": "Hotel muy bien dise\u5e3dado con...   showReview(17571131, 'full');", "Date": "May 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR335064296", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "ni fu ,ni fa.   showReview(15490592, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR990490785", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "mendelu"}, {"Content": "j'y retourne \u813f mon prochain passage \u813f Madrid   showReview(14731305, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR594799318", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Occhio alle cialde   showReview(14731304, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR676378836", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Excellent s\u8305jour en chambre familiale spacieuse dans cet h\u4e48tel   showReview(13845354, 'full');", "Date": "Feb 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR923239405", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "kiwi17"}, {"Content": "Appena aperto!
