But the Sheraton Atakoy, even though it is quite a distance from the city centre of Istanbul, offered a warm and comfortable respite from the cold and the rain. The hotel is very modern and the rooms and public areas are well designed and stylishly furnished. The hotel boasts two restaurants, a grand ballroom and lots of other smaller rooms and areas. Outside the pool area was desolate but would be very attractive on a summer's day. The guest rooms are most acceptable with comfortable beds and a nicely fitted-out bathroom with a stand alone shower rather than one over the bath tub. There is a large closet with plenty of hanging space and drawers and an iron and ironing board. The servicing of the rooms is very basic - mine was not vacuumed for the week I was in residence - but the bed was made, the towels changed and the coffee and tea replenished. The room furnishings are very comfortable and there is a reasonable sized desk facing the huge window overlooking the sea. Room service prices are very generally very reasonable but some imported items in the minibar were not ($10 for a snickers bar). The biggest catch price wise, however, is the laundry which looks reasonable until you read the fine print which tells you that the cost is in Euros ($12 to launder one shirt). A little bit devious in my book! Overall, though, if you don't mind not being in the centre of town, the Sheraton Atakoy is not a bad choice.", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beirut, Lebanon", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel in Every Aspect , Far from City Center\u201d", "Author": "Bassilio", "ReviewID": "UR123782428", "Content": "Beautiful New Hotel, amazing decor and atmosphere.

TIP: Take the hotel shuttle from the airport! (confirm if it's free before your departure) If you don't want to wait, flag a cab down away from the usual cab areas and offer 15-20 TL for your ride to the hotel without meter.

The lobby is gorgeous, the rooms are very comfortable and modern, the service excellent, the staff unfailingly polite and friendly. The view from my hotel room looked out over the sea, and that was pretty stunning. But if you're coming to Istanbul for the first time as a tourist, you'll want to stay in another neighborhood. Sultanahmet, for instance, would be your best bet. Or Beyoglu. Those are where the sights are, and where a wide variety of restaurants will be within walking distance. The Sheraton is sort of in no-man's land, and when I was there, on a cold and rainy week, it was a bit depressing to see how quiet the area was. There's only one restaurant in the hotel, and the food was only so-so for dinner. I wasn't impressed. Breakfast has a nice spread, with both Turkish and American choices. For Asian visitors, there's miso soup, but the rice is pilaf, not the soft, sticky rice that Japanese tourists prefer, so that must be a bit disconcerting for them! Next time I come back, if it's on business, this hotel would be fine.

I've been to many Starwood properties across Asia and have been used to the Asian hospitality and service standards. Am also a SPG Plat member. Pros - Near the airport - Galleria Shopping Mall next door - Clean and good views from the room (Premium room on the 11th floor) - Shuttle service to the old city and airport Cons - No outside food is allowed to be consumed in the room for hygiene reasons (other than being revenue driven, i wonder what, as guests clearly can order room service). Beware that you're advised to finish your consumable food outside the hotel (for me it was in the freezing cold which i firmly objected to) or have it kept and only returned on checkout - No response from an email to the GM regarding the ill-treatment regarding the point on bringing in food purchased from the mall - Staff not motivated to serve (bring up your own bags, unless you specifically ask for help) - Room is stuffy because it is now the cold season, and the central air-conditioning is set to heat and that can't be changed. Had to resort to opening the small window to let the cool air in (thank goodness it opens!) - Club lounge is crowded at breakfast and leftover plates and cups are not cleared in time due to the only 1 service staff on duty (switching to dining at the coffee house is chargeable and frankly too expensive. And forget about asking for a different style of eggs unless you're willing to pay EUR13 for them!) - Housekeeping will not adhere to the electronic DoNotDisturb indicator. Best to put on the door tag.

Set in a green area just of the coastal Kennedy road on the way to the airport. The Old Town is fifteen minutes away by taxi. You have a breathtaking view of the Sea of Marmara from every room (high floors are obviously better) and it's quiet at night so you can sleep with your windows open. Nice breakfasts with a good range of stuff, although pricey at 50 TL per head, a genuinely awful and expensive Asian fusion restaurant, but then we are in Istanbul where if you get anything better than a kebap of quite possibly reptilian origin washed down with a bitter yellow liquid aspirationally called Efes beer, you should consider yourself lucky. Spacious and well-designed rooms. Totally incompetent housekeeping (unwashed glasses, bin liners full of rubbish removed from bins and then left in the room as a present, disappearing bathrobes), a below-average spa. One indoor pool and two outdoor. Water in the smaller one looked quite pleasant sea green from the room window, so I had hopes that this would be a seawater pool. Sadly it turned out to be an unkempt kiddy pool and it was weeds in it that gave it the lovely green colour.... Generally the pool area is poorly maintained with weedy pathways, no sunbed mattresses and staff from the pool bar not bothering to provide poolside service. The waterfront is edged with large wave-breaking slabs, so trying get into the sea is impractical, even if you are mad enough to think that you can swim within the city limits without getting leprosy or some water-borne strain of ebola. Three minutes' walk along the seafront is the grotty Atakoy Marina with plenty of expensive boats in stark contrast to unkempt lawns, peeling plaster of the yacht club building and two fish restaurants, eating in the supposedly better one (as recommended by the concierge) being about as enjoyable as a visit to a dentist. For those who enjoy shopping, across the road is the Galleria mega-mall which I stayed away from, so no comment.

So the closeness to the airport is a big advantage, to avoid the faceless hotels around the airport. But for tourism-oriented travels -that are interested in the Sultanahmet or Taksim-area - the at least 25-minutes taxi ride downtown (sometime it can take over an hour) can be a major criterium against this hotel. Being an SPG Platinum Preferred Member, I usually get an upgraded to an Executive suite. In this category the rooms are superb, in relative terms slightly above the usual SPG Sheraton standard. WIFI works perfectly in all areas and rarely I had problems with my IP-phone. Prices vary very much between low- and high season (usually between 100 - 220 EUR per night), so it you get a price around/below 150 EUR, I would consider it a good value deal . Club lounge on last floor has only two computers but a nice view of the city and a good place to chill before dinner. Big outdoor swimming pool and spacious gym. Sheraton Atatk\u00c3\u00b6y has two restaurants that serve creative international food. Plus, you have the renowned Gelik grill-restaurant within walking distance if you want to have a change.

While I was not surprised that free WiFi was not available in the room as that is an amenity that has not yet reached Europe, I thought the 19.95 EUR ($25) charge per day was an outrage. By far the best feature was the breakfast buffet. There was probably the largest assortment of breads and pastries, fruits and vegetables, meats and cheeses, hot items (including the standard European runny scrambled eggs), made-to-order omelets, pancakes, waffles and French toast, cereals and yogurt, even dates, figs and Turkish delight that I have ever seen on a breakfast buffet.
