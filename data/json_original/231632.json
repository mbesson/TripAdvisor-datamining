It was our last night during our 3 week trip around Europe. We arrived later than we wanted from Barcelona, so we decided to go to sleep early and get up early to see the sites before we had to fly out in the afternoon. We decided to get up at 6 and we saw the Don Quijote statue and palace before there were any tourists out (around 7;30). The hotel was nice and clean. The front desk was very helpful and multilingual. Ours was a double bed which was 2 twins pushed together (like the rest of Europe). The bathroom was nice and had a tub. These are apartment type rooms, so it was pretty big and had a seperate kitchenette that we didn't use. We weren't sure if the fridge worked because it was open and warm when we arrived. TV had CNN in English. They had WiFi, but we didn't have a laptop. There is an elevator. The only complaint we had was that the room we had was adjoined to another room. There was a locked door between us that wasn't insulated very well. You could hear everything through the door and also a lot in the hallway. We had a group of touring high school students staying next to us that got in around midnight and talked until about 2:00. They didn't get up until we were leaving around 10:00 the next morning. This was horribly annoying, so maybe if you go here, ask to stay far away from the touring groups if you come during the summer. There was no breakfast for us provided by the hotel, but there is a restaurant attached that we could have gone to. The hotel is in an okay area. There were some areas where homeless people slept that were between the hotel and the metro. We got in before it got too dark and we saw a few in the morning when we left.

We had a big apt. with a separate bedroom, then a lounge/ dining room and separate kitchen. Hotel is in a good location, about 2 mins. walk from Arguelles metro station (good interchange for 3 lines). It took about 30 mins from the airport. Huge dept. store (El Corte Ingles) is very close by and it was handy for provisions - we bought bread, cheese and meats and took them back to our room to eat them. Downsides: this is a little bit away from Central Madrid (ie. Sol area) so restaurants and bars were hidden in the side streets. Hotel was good but catered predominantly for Spanish guests and very little English was spoken. Menu in the hotel caf\u00e9 was also in Spanish so involved lots of guess work! The caf\u00e9 downstairs was handy for breakfasts. Room size was excellent. However, the kitchen was very ill equipped - there were 2 old knives, 2 old forks and 2 spoons - and 2 cups, 2 plates, 2 saucers. The kitchen had a 2 ring hob - but no pots or pans. What's the point of that?! Therefore you could only use the microwave and could not cook anything. There was no kettle so if you wanted a tea or coffee you had to boil up water in tiny tea cups in the microwave. Also simple things such as no washing-up cloth/scrubber or washing-up liquid - therefore we had to leave our dirty plates in the sink as we had no way of cleaning them. The sofa bed would only be suitable for a child - it was very thin and springy. Would not have been suitable for any adults - unless you wanted a bad back. The only English tv channel we could get was CNN (boring!). There was a tv box but it would not work, so there may have been addlt. channels. All in all, this was a good location.
