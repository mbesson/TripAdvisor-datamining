Cour St-Emilion Metro station also just a stones throw away means you can get around and into the middle of Paris really easily. Bercy Village has a great selection of bars, the Frog at Bercy being one of them (although its very warm in there). Rooms are small, there is no denying it, but given that we didnt spend that much time in there it didnt bother us that much. The bed was a bit odd, a mattress on a plank of wood was literally what it was. That being said, we slept like logs after all the walking around Paris. Breakfast selection was more than adequate, cereals and pastry dishes aplenty.

Very basic but clean room, bathroom and bed. Free wifi is great. English speaking staff is available. Reasonable price with early bird special sale. 2. Location is not exactly central. On the map it seems a little far from city center. However it is very close to metro. Also the metro station is line No.14! No.14 is vey clean and safe even iat night. Also, there are only just few stops (like express) you can go real central station \"chatlet\" (could transfer to many other lines) through just 3 stops! In addition there are some fabulous restaurant and cafe just in front of hotel (int the small street named bercy village before hotel) After all, location is not perfect but very right for sightseeing by metro. One drawback: because the hotel is very opposite side of Eiffel tower, it is a little difficult to come back after seeing the light show of Eiffel. 3. When I visited, the restaurant was under construction. Then in-room breakfast is poor. But as I know breakfast buffet before construction was just ok. 4. Some minor minus: luggage storage Is not for free/ there is no safe in the room (paris is famous for pickpocket)/ room is a little small (like most of paris hotel) but still we have space to open our big carrier.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "gva", "Title": "\u201cThanks to Metro 14, a very quick transfer to central Paris, Gare de Lyon, Chatlet, Saint Lazard\u201d", "Author": "kat1", "ReviewID": "UR124862681", "Content": "I booked one month ahead on ACCOR site, \u20ac 69.- non refundable - prepayment. Official rate is \u20ac92 in low season. From the map, I thought the hotel was 200metres from Cours Saint-Emillion metro stop. That's not far and ok. But when I actually walked between those 2 points, crossing Bercy village shopping/cafe, resto area, I felt like it was only half of it. Very short. The hotel is per IBIS standard, no surprise but when you know other IBIS, you might think this one is a bit better one. Newish/clean (although other IBIS I know have never been dirty either), staff perfectly fine, 2 free PC's at the lobby. Thanks to advices given here by other reviewers, I requested the highest floor possible on Bercy Village side so that you get a look of the Tour Eiffel and Pantheon although far. They gave me 7th floor and I was able to see the tour twinkles at night. The highest floor 8th was under renovation and was not available. We heard small noise occasionally (but never at night) not a real problem maybe because it was a weekend. As mentioned repeatedly by other reviewers, The shops and restos are open on Sunday at Bercy Village that's practical. Eat at one of the restos or if you wish, easy to buy a ready-to-eat sandwiches/salads at a Monoprix (Mono Shop?) along with a bottle of wine, etc that are found at their basement food area. Also many IBIS's have coin operated lockers that cost \u20ac3 - 4. This IBIS is one of them but at check-out when we needed to leave our bags until the evening, was told all the lockers were used and they were ready to keep the bags in their office. It was actually good as they were not charging for it. The newst Metro no.14 connects Bercy area/Biblioth\u00e8que Fra\u00e7ois Metterand and St.Lazard station perhaps in less than 15 minutes (?). Not a very long line but also fewer stations so it's quite quick. Trains are automatically run, new and clean. Last month once I arrived at St.Lazard station from Rouen with a delay at 18h45 ( on time it would have been 18h10) and I had a connection to make, TGV from Gare de Lyon, departure at 19h11. Would I make it in 25 minutes? Seemed unlikely considering all the distances I needed to cover in between including trains stations and metro stations. I was almost ready to look for a hotel near the Gare de Lyon station and take the first TGV next day because 19h11 was the last TGV of the day for my last destination. Still I kept running (thanks to my light and small suitecase) and believe it or not I got on TGV19h11. Arrived at the platform 2 minutes before the departure ! Anyway I would stay at this IBIS again.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Surrey, Canada", "Title": "\u201cdefinitely 3 star hotel\u201d", "Author": "alexinvancouver", "ReviewID": "UR123676861", "Content": "staff at the front desk not friendly breakfast ok and located not far from metro station no coffeemaker and only two towels and way too expensive for service offered", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Campo Grande, MS", "Title": "\u201cnoisy\u201d", "Author": "ZeroC00L Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR122758692", "Content": "Some other guests made too much noise, not only in the night of 31DEZ, they were in 2 or 3 rooms.

We usually stay in the Pullman hotel but couldn't justify spending the \u20ac200 a night rate over New Year's Eve so opted for the Ibis instead. Having never stayed in an Ibis before we were pleasantly surprised with the cleanliness of the rooms, the ease of checking in/out, and the helpfulness of staff. The rooms are very small and basic (no luxuries here!) but fine, a great base for visiting Paris when all you really need is a clean place to rest your head. At \u20ac75 a night the rate was considerably cheaper than our usual hotel and we'll probably stay there again the next time we visit Paris. The only small problems we encountered were when housekeeping tried to come in and clean our room while the Do not Disturb was on the door - which was a worry for privacy. Also, the doors are very thin, so if you are suffering jetlag or want a daytime nap, you will hear every footstep, door slam, hoover etc - the same goes for early nights and late mornings. Be warned if you are a light sleeper, bring ear plugs. Another small tip is, if you plan to store luggage there on the day of your departure, the luggage lockers are located on the 1st floor, at \u20ac2 for a small locker and \u20ac4 for a big one for 24hrs. The small lockers aren't large enough to fit an average check-in case and the big lockers are in short supply, so get up early to avoid missing out and having to drag your luggage around with you all day! Overall this suited us perfectly for our trip to Paris, for us the location is the biggest winner, but it's also great value so you can spend the money you save enjoying Paris!", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bexhill, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA great stay in Paris\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR121283690", "Content": "The hotel is only minutes from the newest Metro (line 14) and then just 7 or 8 minutes to the very heart of Paris.

This is more than I can say for alot of hotels I've stayed in in Paris so I would definitely return. The air con isnt great which was difficult in August with Parisian heat but all in all I was very pleased. My only complaint is the luggage lockers.

The breakfast (although 7 - 8 euros) was well worth it in comparison to prices everywhere else. They had pretty much everything you would need and was well presented - very impressed! The location was great with plenty of restuarants near by, the underground only a short distance away. There was even a good sized park nearby which was great for a walk. There were shops and supermarkets nearby too which gives you an option to buy food and have a picnic. Anyway - overall we were satisfied with the accomodation. Things were expensive (about 7 euros on average for a lager!) but it is Paris.

To store your luggage on checkout until travel time, lockers were provided on the first floor, which cost four euro, thats a new one on me! - usually this is a free service.

Particularly for the location, but also because the hotel is very comfortable and the staff are so lovely. Maybe they've changed since, I don't know, but the hotels rooms won't have changed much - they're good ibis standard. Plenty of hot water, a bath, sizable rooms and comfortable beds. I often go to Bercy village for its gorgeous, cute atmosphere. There are some lovely shops, and restaurants, and it makes for a perfect romantic setting. It is safe, friendly, and right on the metro line to get to anywhere you want in Paris - line number 14. It's not near the Moulin Rouge, as one recent reviewer suggested - they must have got it mixed up with ibis montmartre. Here, you're with real french people, not so many tourists, and the hotel in IN Bercy village, not next to it. It's actually a few doors closer than the Sofitel. I don't see the point in paying so much more when you're getting practically the same deal (sofitel are own by the same chain of hotels as ibis, and although the beds might not be so chic, and you don't get the same design, they maintain the same good standards of service), and I say that as someone who loves luxury, and often stays in five star hotels. But I don't spend stupidly, and I'm not a snob - if the hotel next door boasts the same location, and is warm, inviting and comfortable, and is half the price, I don't see any reason to pay the extra. Ibis is a respected mark of the same chain of hotels as sofitel. It's not dingy or dirty. The centre of paris can be dodgy at night (especially the champs elysess and pigalle). And, often restaurants, and shops close early. This place is so safe and warm and beautiful, and it's buzzing and lit up until 2am every night. It's a place to come home to and relax after a hard days' sightseeing. The perfect retreat. I would definately recommend the area for a first trip to Paris.
