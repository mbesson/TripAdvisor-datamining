There must be over 50 great caf\u00e9s, restaurants and bars within 5 min on foot, with both St Georges and Pigalle Metro stations just down the street. Don't let the red light district keep you from booking, you're quite a few blocks from it and the square the hotel is in has a great local feel. 15 min walk to Gare du Nord. Boulangerie next door and one across the street.

In the cold light of day we found the hotel to be basic but clean, everything worked as it should have, staff were friendly, breakfast adequate, central location and all in all reasonable enough value for money. It would have been nice to have a kettle to make a cup of tea and as there was no access to satellite, watching the big screen TV wasn't very enjoyabe as all the stations were local and we don't speak French very well.", "Date": "November 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Castelnaudary, France", "Title": "\u201cSuper Surprise\u201d", "Author": "Roadfish11", "ReviewID": "UR80797315", "Content": "What a great surprise! We had a room booked at another \"bargain\" hotel, but upon arrival found that they had had a plumbing problem and had arranged for a substitute room at the Hotel Monnier. The plumbing problem became a God Send! We were greeted very graciously a charming desk person who became our source of information and aid. She had a choice of rooms for us, but suggested a 6th floor, under the eaves, romantic room with a view of the Paris rooftops. It was perfect for us. Clean and big enough for our modest needs. Breakfast was fine with the usual foods. The person handling the breakfast area was very accommodating and pleasant. In fact, the entire staff was more than gracious. A real plus for the hotel is it's easy walking distance location between Metro stations Pigalle and St. George. There are several nice bistro type restaurants on the place Toudouze just next to the hotel, several mini-markets and the Mus\u00e9e du Romantisme ( Museum of Romantic Life) just a short walk away. This hotel is a real winner for the budget conscience who want a charming hotel, charming staff, in a charming area.", "Date": "September 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris", "Title": "\u201cFriendly, affordable & a pleasant surprise\u201d", "Author": "AOakeshott", "ReviewID": "UR70575453", "Content": "I booked this hotel for my parents after struggling to find somewhere both affordable and appealing in Paris. I was genuinely surprised by the warm and welcoming approach of the staff and equally surprised to find the rooms much larger than the usual budget Hotels. This is an excellent budget choice, the rooms are simple but spacious and clean with windows that properly open and let in the air. The very top floor has rooms with tiny balconies which look over the city. Furthermore the hotel is in a perfect location in the North of Paris, only a few steps away from Montmartre but also in the new chic area growing around the 9eme. The hotel itself is right on a leafy little square which fills up in the evening with people having dinner and drinks. The staff smoke in the reception but this does not seem to effect the rooms nor the dining room. All in all I was very happy with my choice and particularly impressed by the genuine kindness of the staff.", "Date": "July 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow", "Title": "\u201cNot bad for a last-minute booking\u201d", "Author": "hoolihoop", "ReviewID": "UR43432841", "Content": "Stupidly I left it till the last minute to try to get a hotel for a three-day trip on a budget, and spent maddening hours discovering that pretty much every hotel on this site, laterooms.com, the guide books etc was fully booked. I found this hotel on clickbed.com. I can't complain about the location, or the staff in reception, which/who were excellent. It was relatively cheap (about 85 euros a night), though if I'd been clever enough to book a hotel further in advance I'm sure I could have got a hotel with more character for less money. But so it goes. This was a perfectly adequate hotel in an excellent location, and we only used it for sleeping in. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel, though it was 5 euros for a buffet. The room was basic - no kettle, minibar or anything - with a TV and twin beds (would've preferred a double, but it was last minute...). When we moved the twin beds together, there was evidence that the cleaners don't sweep under the beds every time, but otherwise the hotel was perfectly clean. The handle to the en suite bathroom was threatening to come off, and the shower was installed in such a way that the hot tap was blue and the cold red, but for the money I can deal with this kind of stuff. There was one night when we came home late (the hotel is open 24 hours, but will put up a note to say knock on the door if it gets too late) and had to knock for 5 or 10 minutes before the sleepy old guy on night duty let us in. (A resident across the road, hearing us knocking, appeared on his balcony and phoned the hotel on our behalf, which suggests that wasn't the first time this had happened...) Minor moans... this is a very decent hotel.", "Date": "September 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kehl", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Sebi72", "ReviewID": "UR25442306", "Content": "We liked this hotel.
