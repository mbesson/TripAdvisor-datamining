Like many budget city hotels, it had a very small reception area which certainly made it difficult to check in eighteen people, with others trying to squeeze their way out onto Via Cavour. I was asked to share a room with three others from the group on the third floor. The room was poky, in fact it had two small double beds for the four of us. It was simply unacceptable. I would liken it to a prison cell, with a tiny porthole for a window with an uninspiring view of a dark courtyard. We had to phone our tour company to complain and in fairness, it was agreed that I would be given a single room on the same level. I was initially content with that. The single room was no bigger than my broom closet at home. It was like solitary confinement, dark with the only window being in the toilet, which was equally tiny. In fact the shower head was directly above the toilet - how bizarre. By far the greatest problem with this hotel is that it seems to be the #1 choice for regional Italian primary schools bringing their kids to Rome for the first time. There were three other groups staying at the same time as ourselves - mainly of children aged 10-14. My room was adjacent to that of some of the planet's noisiest girls - chatting, screaming, fighting, giggling, slamming doors, running into the early hours of the morning, all of which was echoed through the membrane-thin walls. I complained once to a very embarrassed teacher: but her efforts at calming the hyper children down was futile. I resorted to the age old act of firing in my iPod at full volume just to help me sleep! The lift was also unacceptable - it was of an old design - there are no stairs except the 'prohibited' fire exit. The lift was so slow and when the other school groups were about, it took min. 5mins to get into the wretched thing. Breakfast was fine, typical Continental but it wasn't fair that we actually had to arrange with the Italian schoolteachers a breakfast rota, as there weren't more than 10 tables. All told, it was a terrible place and this has been reported to our tour operator. We paid over the odds to stay centrally and even with that in mind, Hotel Valle wasn't worth it. If you can get this place dirt cheap and are staying for one night max. - maybe coming back late and leaving early, you'll probably not mind how bad this place is. But otherwise, shop around a bit more.

I was biking with a group in Tuscany and a night was scheduled at this hotel on the way back through Rome and I thought it would be convenient to stay at the same hotel on the way in as well as on the way out of Rome. A week before my departure, I received an e-mail from the hotel saying they had had water problems and could not accomodate me. A reputable hotel would have said that while they couldn't accomodate me they could make arrangements at a hotel nearby if I so desired. Since they made no such suggestion I did not believe their water problem and figured this was just a way of getting a better rate. I had obtained the reservation at a substantial discount price three months before. On such short notice, it cost me 100 euros more a night to get a room elsewhere in Rome. (In retrospect, I'm glad we had to get a room elsewhere). When we did come back to Rome from the biking trip around noon on Sunday October 10th, 2010, we stayed at Hotel Valle through the group reservation. While we had asked for twin beds for my adult son and I, we were getting a double bed. I had to almost fight with the clerk to finally get twin beds (all they had to do was set-up separate beds with separate bed sheets. When they agreed, they then told us they only had one bed cover? Why they just didn't switch room with another couple desiring a double bed is beyond comprehension since most of our group containing 12 conventional couples hadn't yet checked-in. Up the elevator, the smell was not pleasant and things did not improve in the hallway or in the room (I've seen bigger closets than this room). The small 12 inch TV was old, the colour in the picture was gone, and there was no remote available. When we asked for Internet, we were told it was 10 Euros for three hours, which we found was three consecutive hours whether you used it or not. (Grand theft). Other hotels charged for Internet in our three weeks in Italy but only when you used it! When we asked for something at reception, they were always on the phone, typically personal conversations, and we were given the impression of interfering with their personal lives. The Chinese say that people with long faces should not open shops; they shouldn't work in the service industry either. We had to walk over 30 pieces of luggage in the room where all the luggage had been placed to recuperate our own luggage!The next morning, breakfast was the worst I have ever had in a european hotel in 40 years of travelling. Half the service plates were empty and the cheese they served was plastic wrapped industrial slices!!! The coffee was awful and most of us went next door to finish breakfast; it was that bad. They did not accept our credit cards for Internet and only accepted cash...I wonder why??? The hotel is well located on Cavour street just walking distance from the Coloseum and Palatine Hill but it is also a noisy street which is not the best for sleeping. I will not go back there and I doubt the biking service provider will return to this hotel given the bad feedback from everyone.", "Date": "October 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gulfport, Mississippi", "Title": "\u201cSolid value hotel.

However, we would not stay at it again due to a number of flaws and details that were bothering us day after day: 1) The room we stayed at 1st floor was small and dark, and it was possible to hear the subway (line B) running right below us from time. 2) The tiny, suffocating breakfast area was just beside the front desk, with no physical separation between them. During the peak hours in the morning, people trying to check-in/check-out mixing-up with people standing in line waiting for a table really did not motivate us to start our day in such environment. 3) Staff seemed to be in insufficient number. One night I called the front desk to request for a bath towel but there was no one to deliver it to our room because the receptionist was alone during that shift. After being \u201cinvited\u201d to unsuccessfully look for clean towels in another 2 empty rooms (just to find them soiled) the receptionist said he could do nothing as he was not supposed to leave the reception.

We flew in to Fiumicino Airport and caught the train into Rome Termini Station (14 euros) which took about half an hour. We had a suitcase on wheels each so elected to walk to the hotel from the station and along the Via Cavour (the busy road that the hotel is situated on), which took about 10 minutes. The train stops about half away along the very long platform and we made the mistake of exiting the station at this point. The road beside the station is quite busy and the pavement/sidewalk is very uneven here until you reach the Via Cavour. TIP - stay in the station after getting off the train and walk to the end of the platform to the station concourse before leaving the station. If it's your first time in Rome then there are two types of pedestrian crossings across the busy roads - one with lights and one without. If you use a crossing with lights then wait for the green light and avoid jaywalking as there are hundreds of mad motorcyclists waiting to knock you down. If you use a crossing without lights then nobody will stop to let you cross until you start walking across it. Wait for a lull in the traffic and set off but don't stop once you start crossing. You'll find that traffic will stop for you and will even drive past you as you are crossing so don't stop!! On to the hotel. We had room 115 which was at the back of the hotel overlooking a courtyard. I wouldn't have liked a room at the front as the main road is noisy and I'm a light sleeper. Our room was extremely quiet though in the morning the occupants of the next building used to get up early and you could hear them talking in their apartment. Our room was a twin with two small beds that were quite hard. The room was small, the shower was good, the room generally clean. I found it OK for just the couple of nights but would prefer a softer bed if staying longer. There was no safe in our room though our friends next door did have one so we shared that. The guy on the front desk was efficient though not particularly sociable. We left our cases at reception on the morning we left as our flight wasn't until late. No charge for that. Breakfast was a buffet of cornflakes, cheese and meat, hard boiled eggs, rolls, croissantes, cake, yoghurt, tea, coffee, orange. It was fine for us and we stoked up every morning before setting off. The hotel has wi-fi but no computer but the bar next door has an internet facility upstairs which cost about 1.50 euros for about 10 mins or so. There are plenty of restaurants in the vicinity - we ate both nights in a restaurant opposite the hotel and slightly up the hill, sitting outside. However, you get pestered regularly by people trying to sell you flowers, soft toys, umbrellas, etc and are a bit of a pain when you are eating. The colisseum is just 10 mins down the road. We walked to the Vatican instead of taking transport but on reflection it would have been better and quicker to take a city tour bus, which goes along the Via Cavour and you can get on and off at most of the main sights. There is a metro station down the road but we didn't use it. If you go to the Vatican, go up to the top of the dome. You can either walk up the 800 odd steps or take a lift and walk up 300 steps. It's not difficult, only costs about 7 euros and the views are great.", "Date": "May 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn, New York", "Title": "\u201cgood place with caveats\u201d", "Author": "nycdawg81", "ReviewID": "UR62980020", "Content": "I had a decent time at Valle Hotel. I stayed 4 nights during a vacation for about $180 a night. I had room 302. Initially we had room 118, which was SMALL. They had a queen sized bed in there and I could barely walk around it. I had booked for a two double beds prior and asked for it to be honored. They did honor that and switched me to room 302 that was huge compared to 118. It may have been twice as large. Long story short, if you get a small room, do NOT hesitate to ask for another room. It appeared to me that the rooms on the 2nd and 3rd floor were renovated and may be larger. But that is speculation. Having said all of that, 3 things were wrong in my room. The piece that holds the shower handle up was broken along with the blow dryer handle. The bathroom doorknob was a little wonky but not broken. I let the concierge person know so that I wouldn't be charged and I wasn't. Breakfast is decent. Nothing fancy but you get hard boiled eggs, pound cakes, cereal, juice, milk, coffee, tea, bread. Had better and had worse.

Good 'supermarket' , the Elite, on the left walking down the hill, just past the Metro, again, closed on Sunday. All else fails, turn right coming out of the hotel and there is a Korean supermarket a few doors up, more expensive than the Elite. Beer is expensive in the bars here, but you can stock up in a supermarket cheaply (the hotel rooms have a fridge). Crossing the road, it's not the cars that will get you, it's the scooters, you have been warned.

I am not joking. If you stay here the teeny room for ONE person on Floor three just oposite the lift is really quite terrible. But at 80euro's per night it was reasonoble for a single traveller I guess. On another note the staff we excellent, English speaking, helpful! Our bathroom was lovely too, small and otherwise known as a 'Wet room' I think there wasn't a shower curtain & the water got to the stage where we had to lay towels at the doorway to stop it flooding the bedroom...the loo also got soaked while showering and I think it was made for giants (although judging by the size of the room & the bed I'm not so sure!) my feet were pretty much dangling while sitting on the loo, and I really am not that short! 5ft 3\" ish.

I had paid almost \u00a3600 to stay here on a bed and breakfast basis and my room was nothing better than a cell! It was extremely dark, far too hot (with no working air conditioning unit) and the breadspread was filthy. In addition, there was only one window which was so high up so as not to be reached. The ensuite bathroom was also very small and there was not always hot water available. Over the course of my stay it became obvious that the bed linen was not being changed either.

To be objective, it is not easy to find an accomodation, which has 2 (preferably: 3) rooms, where you can split, particularly to have 2 bathrooms, centrally located and fair in price (at least for the Rome yardsticks). The residence is probably converted from a garage, with a space above it. They connected the two with a stair. The residence has a separate entrance from the hotel (just around the corner) with a direct entrance from the side-street. It was a fairly good taste when they made the interior (should have happened some 10 years ago), but the time, and the use has worned it pretty much. You have to count with having no TV reception, to have planty of noise (due to poor quality of window and door insulation), and some humidity from the basement can be sensed on the walls. We have higher demand for the cleaniness than what you get there - even if the towels are nice. Have a good stay, but don't forget to bring extra ear-plugs with you.

The advantage is that you can come and go as you please and don't need to stop by at the front desk or take a lift. The keys and room were ready for us when we arrived. The apartment appeared to have been recently redone with nice floors and excellent bathrooms by european standards. The apt. is two stories with a large bedroom upstairs and a loft twin bed and smaller bathroom. The room was advertised as a two bedroom, but this is not the case. There are 2 twin beds downstairs. You can book this room on ryanairhotels or octupustravel. The rate was very reasonable for a family of 5. We would of had to book 2 rooms at the hotel for the number of guests ($$$). The area is questionable as others suggested although we had no problems. The upstairs is loud from street traffic if you have to have the windows open. The lack of windows makes the unit very dark and musty. The comforters were the only part I wished they cleaned or changed. The sheets and towels were very clean. Housekeeping did a great job and we found the front office to be very helpful. When we needed an extra fan, the housekeeping brought it over quickly. There are two grocery's very close (which was fun to shop for new food). The restaurants and gelateria nearby were very good. The train station/metro was reasonably close to get to everything quickly (5 minute walk). If you have small children, no port a cribs are available. A plus is that the place is built out of solid concrete, we didn't have to worry about the children crying at night or horseplaying. Would I stay here again?? probably not...but we did need a big place and didn't want to spend over $200 US a night for accomodations. This is the only place I think this is possible.
