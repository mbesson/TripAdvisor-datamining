{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Concept very different My wife and I did not visit Bali since getting married 12 years ago and when we did decide to take a break, we found this place which was 2 1/2 hrs away from Denpasar but what they offered us was a complete experience for one price.The journey in the luxurious vehicle made it worth our while and the check in was just fantastic, a feet wash with fine black sand from the beach(yes this place has black sand unlike the sand in other places) and I must say I was surprised and followed by a 20 minute head and neck massage to take all the tiredness away.Our itinerary was given to us since we told them that we are coming for a break from the daily stress of working life and this itinerary covered a selection of spa treatments at various times based on our needs. Our meals were all included and they had us on the yoga program, a cooking class, some creative drawing, making of the spa ingredients and jamu drinks etc.On one night we went on this traditional boat, Jukung for a sunset cruise and it was marvelous. They also have a stargazing section and oops, my camera dropped in the pool and so no pictures......but I will be back there again.All staff are very warm and friendly and as a Malaysian, I think the Balinese hospitality is excellent.", "Date": "Nov 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR324029986", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Spafinder"}, {"Content": "Great start to Honeymoon We have just come back from a honeymoon in Bali and spent the first 4 nites in the Spa Village.

We were there when the resort on refurbishment stage. Thought we could reserve a room for our summer vacations. We used to stay there 2 years a go. The resort that time was simple with authentic Balinese style service given by the staff and the lady who managed the resort was really helpful. Although, the resort is now turning into more an up-scale hotel. We did not see this Bali charm hospitality as it used to be. Everybody were so stiff and the Manager was not polite. So we decided to book another hotel. However, we are sad to know that this property becoming a not welcomed property as it used to be.
