{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Do not stay at Aliwal Park Hotel I agree with John. I was staying in this hotel in Feb 2006, at that time the rate was $50/night. The real room look much more worse than on the pictures, the bed has bed bugs in it, the room is so old, the building is so old. Cockroaches come out from the bathroom, the bathroom is so stink and smelly.I should have wrote this review back in Feb 2006, but now I'm planning to travel again to Singapore. I learned my lesson that the hotel indeed was cheap but it was really bad, and make you feel that you better off paying another $50 more to get much more better hotel.John mentioned that they charge the rate of $25/2 hours and most of the guest does not have any luggage. I was surprised as well why the hotel will only charge $25/2 hours,then I noticed that most of the guests are mostly are men who bring prostitute to have sex with. As I was travelling alone for the first day, when I was sitting at the lobby and being asian, there was one guy looking at me in funny way, then I saw a couple who check in without carrying any luggage then everything come to sense.On the second day my friends come and join me, and I feel really bad as I was the one who is responsible to book an accomodation and this Aliwal Park Hotel was the worse place I ever been to, this place only use mostly for prostitutes might as well they convert the hotel into a brother instead being advertised at expedia.com and hotels.com as a hotel.My friends and I when we were stopping over at Singapore for 3 days by the end of the night, we are NOT looking forward to go back to hotel to have a nice shower and relax, even though after 11:00 pm until all the shops are closed in Singapore,we are still reluctant to come back to Hotel to have shower and sleep there. We don't want to transfer to another hotel because we cannot get any refund for the money we have paid. so we just keep telling ourselves that it will be just another 2 days and after that we will be ok.until now, I can't believe that this Aliwal Park Hotel has been keep advertised on the web, and only 3 review so far has been posted for this hotel.I am so glad that I put this review on this website as it is to warn another consumer to not stay at Aliwal Park Hotel.", "Date": "Mar 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR869422084", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "travellersyd"}, {"Content": "The price list tells it all. Hotel was booked through the Internet and looked reasonable from pictures available. (They must have been taken a few years ago)The rooms turned out to be small, seedy and dirty. En suites were a joke with water leaking through the ceiling, and shower draining to the corner instead of to the drain.The hotel was very popular with many guests, most of who checked in without luggage. What really gave the game away though was the price list at the front desk which read, Room Rates. $25 for 2 Hours If you only want a room for 2 hours, its your kind of place. If you are a tourist looking for budget accommodation, try elswhere.JohnM", "Date": "Jul 6, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR890693249", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "JohnMSingapore"}, {"Content": "Aliwal Park Hotel Singapore   showReview(8398544, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 12, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR201863776", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "DirkBali"}, {"Content": "N'y allez pas !!   showReview(6325423, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 4, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR808642274", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Mistibiche"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d446809-r14273430-Aliwal_Park_Hotel-Singapore.html", "HotelID": "446809", "Price": "$102"}}
