Overall, this is a good hotel. I noticed some other comments on TripAdvisor about the slow response times of the airport shuttle bus. I found out first-hand this is due to all the various airport terminal stops along the way. However, my return ride to the airport the next morning on the shuttle was less than 10 minutes from the hotel to T1. Tip: Be sure to sign-up for the time slot you need a shuttle ride. It probably seats 10-12 people, so you will want to eliminate the risk of missing a free-ride to the airport. Check-in / Check-out took less than 10 minutes. English-speaking staff were very hospitable and helpful. The room was large, compared to other hotels I've stayed in Europe. Queen bed (room 317) was comfortable. Took a visit to the check-in desk for instructions on how to operate the air-conditioning system, but once I got it turned on, it cooled the room within 10 minutes and stayed comfortable all night. Due to the late hour of my arrival at the hotel, I did not have a chance to explore the neighborhood to see if there were any good restaurants nearby; opted instead for a room-service meal which arrived in less than 15 minutes of ordering (at ~9pm). I think that's the fastest room service I've ever received! Bathroom is rather spacious, which makes me question why the hotel designer opted for such small, pre-fabricated shower stalls with no tub. This is the only flaw I see with this hotel. While it is easy to shower in the stall, it is near impossible to dry yourself off without banging your elbows into the shower doors. Exit the shower you must, in order to dry yourself. Free morning breakfast was very good; several choices. Since I opted for the 7:20am shuttle to the airport, I was the first person to arrive at the restaurant for breakfast (which opens at 7am). If I'm ever back in Madrid for a one-night layover, I would definitely consider this hotel again.", "Date": "September 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGood location and cheap but that is it...\u201d", "Author": "Logitrav", "ReviewID": "UR136768471", "Content": "Convenient to airport...

I work in a hotel myself and have seen alot of reviews saying that the food is expensive - first of all its a hotel food on site isnt going to be cheap i thought the prices were quite reasonable though i sort out something from the surroundings and ended up finding a pizza place a short distance behind the hotel and it was delicous and inexpensive.

In a vehicle it\u2019s about five minutes. We had pre-arranged a third party pickup at the airport which went smoothly, only to find that the hotel had a free shuttle service. The helpful receptionist cancelled our car for the next day so that was 22 Euros saved. We had a good meal in the restaurant with helpful staff. The \u201csecret recipe\u201d Iberian pork was excellent (very tender slices of high quality pork with a BBQ style sauce) and the calamari very tender. The macchiato was a disaster \u2013 about 50% milk and it tasted homogenised at that; but the Riioja at 12 Euros was very decent. Breakfast is the usual buffet affair with decent bacon, tasteless scrambled egg, tortilla, beans, pastries, juices etc. The bean machine coffee was fine. There are about 80 rooms. The beds were comfortable and we had a quiet night in a room at the back. The hotel is in a residential area and not on yet fairly close to the main airport road so I think there will always be a background hum of traffic, but it\u2019s reasonably quiet. Sound insulation between the rooms is average. The room and bathroom were decently sized, smartly furnished and very clean. We booked our shuttle to the airport for 09:20 (they go about every 40 minutes in the morning). It was a little late, but the minibus was smart and comfortable and the driver friendly and courteous. Our all up cost for the night, for two, with a two course dinner with wine, room, breakfast and shuttle was EU160 which I thought good value.

As other reviewers have said in more detail, the room was a decent size, very clean, had lots of high tech advantages (including electrical sockets that were actually near the desk and not loaded up with other appliances). Interesting shower although I never did figure out how to work the extra nozzles. The front desk cheerfully gave me three different free passwords and codes so we could log in with my husband's computer, my computer and my US cellphone which picks up wireless.

It was a short and very pleasant walk to the metro to go into central Madrid. The Metro can easily get you to any site that you would want to see.

In the end, I had to renew my room reservation for another four nights until I could finally get a train for my return journey. The hotel staff were extremely helpful and welcoming; charged me the same room rate throughout even though demand was pushing up local charges; and allowed me unlimited free printing of timetables, flight bookings etc. My room was a decent size, and clean, with a comfortable bed, good shower, plenty of power sockets and the aforementioned internet access - WiFi, or ethernet, with a laptop provided in the room. Its speed was adequate if not outstanding. The lighting was excellent compared to most hotel rooms. Mobile phone rection was very good. The decor was a little tired in places, but the only real downside of the room was the TV - only 6 channels, of which two were in German, one was EuroSport, one seemed tgo be mainly a shopping channel, and the others were respectively an arts and a \"lifestyle\" channel in Spanish - nothing in English or French and no major news or film channels in any language. I'm not normally a great TV watcher, but under the circumstances more choice would have been a plus. The breakfast buffet was fine as far as I was concerned .- good choice of fruit, hot drinks and bakery products. I didn't eat an evening meal at the hotel as, like most of Spain, it wasn't very vegetarian-friendly. The nearest Metro station (1 Euro for the direct, reliable, frequent c 30 minute ride to the centre of town) is about 7 minutes' walk away; there is a small supermarket, a greengrocers', bakers', pharmacy and small cafes and bars slightly closer.

Lets cut to the chase.... here are my observations based on the fact it advertises itself as a 4 star hotel: 1. All fixtures and fittings are cheap and shoddy. As an example the bathroom floor was plastic strips of wood which were lifting due to water damage. 2. The internet connection, (free) is slow 3. Breakfast was potentially a health hazard, we ate early but the baked beans looked as if they were several days old and the boiled eggs were ice cold ie not recently cooked but probably yesterdays and kept in a fridge. The butter was warm. 4. The waitress was off handed with guests 5. No english speaking tv channels 6. The bathroom was not clean, wiping a finger over any surface showed dirt and dust 7. The worst complaint - I felt itchy in the morning and jumped right into the shower. When I examined my sheets they were covered in tiny black human hairs yet I am fair haired. This repulsed me, I wish I had checked prior to sleeping in the bed. I had, the previous week, stayed nearby at the amazing Axor Barajas hotel. What a difference and it was cheaper!

The friendly staff gave us the same room, with the same rate until Thursday - could not ask for more. Great job guys. I wish we could say the same about Iberia. PROS Great service and pleasant staff Nice room Internet worked great, WIFI and fixed Lots of great shops and restaurants around the hotel - especially the outside BBQ that opens at night by a private pool complex - just take a walk around and follow your nose.

The shuttle was right there when we wanted to leave in the morning. The food in the restaurant was good and there were other restaurants at the hotel complex right next door. The room was clean and comfortable and the shower worked fine and had hot water. I must admit the shower was a little confusing to operate. I really wonder if the other folks who wrote reports stayed at a different hotel. They could use better signage as you approach the hotel.

Was pleasantly surprised by the room and overall decor of the hotel. All looked very new, modern, and trendy. Room was big with nice wooden floor, big bathroom, nice lighting, free internet access (computer to use provided in the room!). The bathroom was equiped with a nice shower cubicle with normal shower as well as extra body jets and also an option to use the cubicle as a steamroom. Furthermore the room was equiped with an excercise bike, which I thought was a nice extra touch (even though I didn't use it.). Room had double or tripple glazing limiting noise from outside. Staff was smiley and friendly. Only downside was that the walls between rooms seemed thin, so I woke up when my neighbour entered his room in the evening, woke up in the morning, used the bathroom etc. Would probably stay here again if convenient for business, but would not stay at this specific hotel if in Madrid for pleasure due to location. However, I did see this High Tech Hotelles chain has hotels all over Spain (including city based locations) and based on my experience in this hotel I would check out their other hotels if traveling to Spain again for business or pleasure.", "Date": "October 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mt.

We would have been far better off staying on Gran Via and taking an airport shuttle for $19.00 to and from the airport.

My family and I had a bad experience with the desk staff and shuttle. When booking I understood that the shuttle was available from 6AM to Midnight.

We did't even try to call for the shuttle as I knew it was too late, so tried to take a taxi to the hotel instead. We were refused service by 4 taxi drivers (because it was too close) so I went back into the terminal to call the hotel. They said there was no way the shuttle could pick us up, and recommended that we get the police involved since the taxis were refusing service. It took over 2 hours to contact the correct police (must be municipal police) so by this time it was well past 2AM. I called the hotel asking them to cancel my reservation as it was a huge undertaking to reach them, plus we had to be back in the airport in 4 hours for our flight out the next morning. We would just stay at the airport and try to get at least an hours sleep. The desk staff was very rude, stating that they would charge my credit card (which I had given to reserve the room) regardless because it was our responsibility to reach the hotel. I expressed that I would stop charges on my credit card, and their reply was to \"go ahead and try, they would put the charge though somehow.\" With no means of transportation, there was no way for us to reach this hotel other than taxi or by walking.
