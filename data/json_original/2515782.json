The suite set-up and great made-to-order breakfasts were ideal for families. Our last experience at an Embassy Suites as empty-nesters was a real disappointment. First, it appeared that our room was not adequately cleaned. The toilet seat was sticky. The soap in the soap dish was not wrapped, and the bottom was wet as if it had been used. The empty soap box was lying on the counter. When I went to take a shower, the tub filled up with water while I was adjusting the temperature. So I knew a shower would be pointless. We had to call maintenance at 11 p.m. to clear gobs of hair out of the drain. Additionally, the decor in our suite look worn and a piece of the wallpaper in the bathroom was peeling away. And the notepad on the table had writing on it from the last occupants. We thought that breakfast would make up for everything. Not! The breakfasts have really declined. We could have stayed at dozens of less expensive hotels (We paid $139 per night, with discounts.!) but we figured that the breakfast would make up for the higher price. Actually, we could have stayed somewhere for $99 per night and had a good breakfast at IHOP and come out ahead.

We selected it because of the location and price. We stayed one night at the beginning of our national park drive and one night before heading home. The hotel is generally quiet if you stay away from the elevators. I would suggest the back of the hotel. It is one of the smaller Embassy Suites I have stayed at, which was nice. Parking was close to the front door and well lighted at night. Unlike the strip hotels you don\u2019t have to mess with valet parking or the wait to get your car and there are no slot machines in the lobby. The room was clean and the beds were comfortable. Don\u2019t, I repeat don\u2019t, get suckered into paying extra for a balcony with a double queen bed room. The description online for the rooms implies that the balcony is large and features patio furniture, this is only true for the single king rooms on the front of the building. The rooms with two queen beds have a 20 square foot balconies at best that you can stand on and watch the traffic from the side of the building. For this pleasure you pay extra. I really suggest that Hilton makes this clearer on their website, for those of us who use the internet to make reservations. The breakfast was great, I have not found an Embassy Suite yet that failed this test. The staff was friendly at check in and the staff at the breakfast area was very friendly. The two bar tenders at the managers reception should find other jobs. While standing in line for our complementary cokes and cranberry juice, all we had to listen to was them complaining about how people kept asking for \u201ctop shelf\u201d alcohol and how stupid they were to think that it would be available for \u201cfree\u201d. That combined with the plain nacho chips and salsa that was the only food offered; made me wonder why they bother offering this.

Hello. My name is Brian, Hilton Honors Member XXXXXXXX. I am writing this letter to withdraw my membership in Hilton Honors. I no longer wish to be a member of Hilton Honors, and will not spend another dollar with your hotels. Not that it will matter to you, but I am going to explain why that after 96 nights in less than 1 year I am doing this. My last four or five stays with you were miserable by anyone\u2019s interpretation of the word. Since it was my most recent trip that forced my hand, I will describe it to you. Checked in on 09/8/2011 at the Embassy Suites on Paradise Rd in Las Vegas. I\u2019d checked in for four nights, yet had to obtain new keys daily because they\u2019d kept checking us out. (Room 920) Found major rust stains in the bathtub, where my daughter, age 9 would have bathed. Disgusting. Morning of 09/09/2011\u2026breakfast. Discovered mold on bread that my daughter had eaten. Mine and that had by my wife had mold on it as well. Staff joked that there was no extra charge for the mold, but we didn\u2019t find that funny. They\u2019d cleared the bread from the table. Morning of 09/10/2011\u2026evidentially the joke was on us, because we were fortunate to have received more moldy bread. We\u2019d stopped eating in your hotel after that. Afternoon of 9/10/2011\u2026returned to the room at 3:00 p.m. The room had yet to made up, no towels\u2026nothing. We were told by the front desk that not having the room cleaned by 5:00 p.m. was normal!!! Really?!?! Because if that\u2019s true, I\u2019ve been pretty fortunate over the years. Afternoon of 9/11/2011\u2026retuned to the room at 2:30 p.m\u2026.guess what? No towels, no clean. Evening of 9/11/2011\u2026remarked that lowering the flag to half-staff on the anniversary of 911 was something the hotel should consider\u2026especially with military personnel staying at the hotel. Evening of 9/11/2011\u2026toilet breaks. Go downstairs to report it. The woman behind the desk asks me to stick my hand inside the toilet to \u201cfix the rubber thing\u201d inside. Needless to say, I\u2019d declined. We used the lobby restrooms that evening. The major problem I have is that I\u2019d spent a lot points for this trip for my family. If I\u2019d paid, I\u2019d be seeking a refund! Just one bit of advise and then I promise you will never hear from me again\u2026If your staff treats Diamond members this way, how do normal everyday folks get treated?

After spending four nights here, we were so bored we switched to over to the Paris casino (which ended up being cheaper than the Embassy and under government per-diem) and just put up with the ringing slot machines and smokey lobby. This hotel sucked the life out of the first half of our stay. The Embassy Suites was exactly what an Embassy Suites should be and I after staying in them for nearly 30 nights last year, I would know. Same amenities, same bed, same alarm clock, same breakfast options, everything you expect, minus two big things. This hotel is not quiet. The atrium acts as an echo chamber and even though I was on the top floor towards the back, I could hear kids at the pool every morning. This hotel is not in the flight path for McCarran Airport, but it is in the flight path for Nellis AFB and those long range transports make a heck of a lot more noise than a 747. The other big thing, and this was the primary driver for our move, the internet connection was unusable. The hotel is completely wireless and the network quickly gets saturated. There are Ethernet ports on the wall by the phone, but the staff informed me that they are decorative, not functional. DSLreports had my connection speed at 30kbps the Tuesday night I was there. That's below 1994 AOL speeds. At that speed my VPN connection couldn't stay up and I ended doing work on my phone. Ever tried to work on presentations on an iphone? Also, be prepared to wait for machines at the gym each morning. There are three treadmills and two ellipticals and many of our servicemen stay here, so those guys are up and rolling at 5am to work out each day. There are other drawbacks as well, such as the surrounding neighborhood. Mostly low rent apartments and no-tell motels. The only food within walking distance in the Envy Steakhouse in the Marriott and a McDonald's. Who goes to Vegas and eats at McDonald's? If you look at the map, it appears there are a great deal of restaurants with half mile, but with Paradise Road being torn up to replace water mains, and the shady neighborhood, it's not a trek I was willing to take. On the plus side, I did have a decent view of the strip from my balcony. I would call it more of a tease than a view.

We upgraded to one of the \u201cLarge Balcony Rooms\u201d, and I\u2019m glad we did. They all face the strip, and the view at night is spectacular. I am convinced the view is better than anywhere we have stayed on the strip because you can see it all. The balconies are about 12 feet by 30 feet with several chairs and lounges. (See Picture) We only made the managers reception one night. About the same as any other Embassy Suites. This one how ever does not give you a limited number of tickets for drinks like I have run into at other Embassy\u2019s, so it is all you can drink. The free breakfast is very good and the quality at this one was above normal. The room is typical Embassy, but I think they had just been re-done. Everything looked new and fresh. The bathrooms were above average size. The lobby has a computer to print out your boarding passes, but it was down, so the clerk offered to print them for us. Nice touch on their part. We rented a car, and this hotel is very conveniently located to the strip, and makes a good starting for doing all the touristy stuff. We had no issues parking at any of the casinos and malls. Day trip to the dam and Green Valley was only about 2 hours total, and worth the trip to me, but my daughter was not impressed with driving that far to see a \u201cBrick Wall\u201d holding back water.

And while there is a monorail station about four blocks away, the hotel is located in an area of Vegas that borders on seedy, and I would not recommend making that walk at night. Lastly, I found the hotel staff to be a little on the impatient side and not overly anxious to help with routine questions.

In fact, I booked this hotel based on the reviews I read here. We'd booked a room for five nights, but ended up checking out after the first night as the hotel just wasn't what we had in mind. Yes, the suite concept is handy, and the happy hour and breakfast is a nice touch. However, it was difficult to get a drink due to the small bar area and the masses of people bellying up to the bar at Happy Hour. Breakfast was a similar mob scene, and while the food was tasty, the crowded breakfast area was a major drawback for us. We also found the hotel noisy, as all the rooms face the atrium and the noise really travels. Our room was in desperate need of an overhaul - it was dark and gloomy and the living area furniture was soiled and worn. The bathroom really needed some attention - the tile around the shower could have used a good scrub and repair - tiles were loose and some had fallen off. Chunks of grout were missing and the rest was just plain dirty. Thecold water spigot came off in our hands every time we turned the water on, and the toilet paper spent most of its time on the floor, as the dispenser was hanging from one nail. Every time we turned on the water in the bathroom we were met with a loud howling noise from somewhere within the pipes. The room left us with an overall impression of neglect and dinginess. We were looking for a comfortable, quiet off strip hotel experience and this particular Embassy Suites didn't fit the bill, so we left and found a cleaner, well-maintained hotel in a much quieter, less chaotic area. Parking at the hotel wasn't a problem, but it was a bit of a pain to get in and out of their parking lot, as the monorail runs through here and it's easy to miss the turn.

The hotel offers a free buffet breakfast, which was pretty good, hot, and with a lot of variety. There was a huge line the day after Thanksgiving, but I think everone wanted to get out to go shopping. The pool was clean and fun, just with a bit too much chlorine. The beds were comfortable, the staff was friendly, and the room was clean. I loved the bath soap, too! We were about 1 mile from the strip, but there were still a few casinos within walking distance, in case the gambling bug strikes. Also, the LV Monorail is just a 5 minute walk, and it's a great, safe and clean way to get to the strip if you don't have a car. There was always a cab sitting outside the hotel, too. If you're going to visit Las Vegas, this a great choice for an off-strip hotel. (The only glitch we experienced was that my mom stayed with the four of us, and has a bad back. We had asked for a rollaway for the room(instead of her using the pull-out couch), and I called a few times during the week prior to our arrival to confirm it. When we arrived at 11pm, there was no rollaway and we were informed that it is Embassy Suites policy not to allow rollaways in rooms with two beds and a pull-out couch, due to space and fire hazard issues.

Even though the hotel was sold out for the five nights of our stay, we never encountered any problem with parking availability for our rental car. The location was great for us.

The suites are very nice - spacious, clean, with comfy beds, good sized fridge, 2 TV's. Free Breakfast is quite good -- yummy omlets. Free cocktails from 5:30 to 7:30 can be a zoo, but the bartender pours well and is a good guy. Staff was pleasant, although it took some nagging to check in early -- they didn't seem to be jumping through any hoops to get me a room earlier than 3pm check-in time. Our problem is getting out of the hotel. Monorail is over 3 loooooong blocks away, and it drops you off way in the back of only a few hotels. Walking to the Sands conv. center is a loooong 1/2 mile. Trying to get a cab to pick us up on Friday nite proved impossible. We ended up eating in the hotel restaurant -- not by choice, but it was actually pretty good. Other guests reported similar frustrations getting to the Strip. Missed dinner reservation due to lack of cabs. I love to walk and am in pretty good shape, but Vegas demands a lot of walking anyway, and my feet got tired enough from walking the strip, Fashion Show Mall, etc. Cabs at other times of the day are available. There seemed to be a lot of families with kids there for gymnastics or cheerleadingtournaments -- a fine hotel if you are not going to do stuff on the strip, or are staying mid-week.", "Date": "February 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southern California", "Title": "\u201cnice hotel away from the glitz but close enough for fun\u201d", "Author": "freykr", "ReviewID": "UR6477370", "Content": "stayed here for business Dec. 14-16th. 2006. Overall a very decent place, friendly staff, convenient location, no problems at all. Because I work Las Vegas frequently, I'm not a big gambler and have seen most of the sights. This hotel is a nice change of pace, no slot machines in the lobby like the majority of most establishments in LV. The rooms are nice, as with all Embassy Suites, it was a 2 room suite, the bedding was comfortable, the mini fridge was handy for my soft drinks I usually have on the road, the breakfast was very good [fresh prepared omelets and other selections] The location is fair to good. It is on Paradise road which is just east of the strip, it's not an area I would recommend to walk around in late at night like you can on the strip, but I felt safe and secure. It is very convenient for those visiting the Las Vegas Convention center, I didn't have business at the convention center this particular trip but I have stayed at other hotels in LV when attending conventions and it's either a cab fare, monorail ride, or long painful walk . Not so from this Embassy Suites. I did go out one night, walked to convention center monorail station, caught a free shuttle to the new Wynn Resort [WOW!], then walked south on the strip to Paris/Bally's then caught the LV monorail back to hotel which is a 5 minute walk from the convention center monorail station. Something I always rate a hotel by is the quality of their internet connection that I need for work. I easily connected wireless and had an \"excellent\" connection from my 8th floor suite.

The full complimentary breakfast every morning was great; made to order omelettes, potatoes, bacon, scrambled eggs, etc. were all included with beverages. Definitely worth getting up for. The only drawback to this hotel is the location. If you plan to spend a lot of time on the strip, you'll need transportation because it is not within walking distance.

Typical Embassy Suites property, maybe near the top of the range for this brand in terms of overall condition of rooms and hotel. If you are a Hilton Hhonors member, this is maybe one of the better choices in town. Location is on Paradise Road, which runs parallel to the Strip (LV Blvd). It is an easy 10-minute walk north to the Convention Center monorail station, and an additional 5 minutes to reach the north hall of the Convention Center. We found it convenient enough for our leisure trip. Tip: across from the monorail station at the SW corner of Paradise and Desert Inn roads is the waiting area for the Wynn shuttle. Our room had a small balcony just wide enough to stand on and get some fresh air. Rooms at the end of the halls on 9th and 10th floors have gigantic balconies with lounge chairs. If you are an Hhonors Diamond member, you might ask to be placed there. Property attracts business travelers and families. Considering the free breakfast and happy hour, it's a good value alternative to a casino property on the strip especially if you are renting a car anyway.
