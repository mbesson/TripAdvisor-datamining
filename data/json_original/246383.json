The location is good in terms of convenience for sight-seeing and there is a certain aura about staying so close to the forum et al (walking past the forum every night on your way home!). It's about 10 minutes walk from the nearest metro station (Circus Maximus) but that's as much to do with the city's limited metro system as anything else. The rooms have mostly been recently renovated and are of a good size. The bathrooms are large and have the biggest sink you will ever find. I was staying on the top floor so got a balcony with a good view of the Forum and Palatine Hill. There was no noise from outside, although being at the top and in the opposite corner from the street it may not mean much. The lobby and corridors are very sleek and a bit lacking in character, which is a bit jarring considering all the ancient landmarks surrounding it. Breakfast is decent, but not really what you would expect from somewhere for this price. The staff are friendly and helpful, especially the ladies at breakfast. The only problem is, you will probably encounter various small problems that shouldn't take much to be fixed, but have already been listed by previous reviewers. Breakfast, while decent enough, is inferior compared to other places around Italy that are a lot cheaper. There's no washing up products to clean your dishes from day to day. I wasn't eating in much so it didn't become a big issue but why has such a basic thing been overlooked? Everything is very sleek and modern, but there's a lack of charm to it. Wifi is not free, even though even B&B's these days are sometimes able to offer it, let alone a luxury sort of hotel like this. The key to the room is a massive metal \"tube\" that not only takes a lot of space in your pocket but also weighs an absurd amount when it's just a key. It's just not sensible or practical. There's a number of little things like this that others have commented on that leave you regularly thinking \"this should be better\". It's a shame because the rooms are excellent otherwise and they've got good enough staff and an excellent location. It's like management is penny pinching or trying to cut corners when the gains are negligible compared to the downsides. In terms of value for money, it's ok but not great. The rooms are certainly worth it, but the various nagging issues make it hard to justify spending the extra \u20ac40-50 compared to other accomodation in Rome. If they can just focus on the details and get everything up to the same standard as the rooms and staff then it would be an excellent place to stay. As it is, I'm not sure I would choose to stay here again, at least not without giving other places a try first. It's a shame, because with the right approach this could be excellent all around.", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "South West England", "Title": "\u201cI would certainly stay there again\u201d", "Author": "travelpig_9", "ReviewID": "UR124861297", "Content": "A modernised building several hundred years old which is converted into suites.

The size of our room was very good (room 13) with separate bedroom and lounge (with kitchenette behind a folding screen). Our only adverse comment would be that the room needs a refresh (update) as the bathroom unit surfaces were worn/craked and also the kitchenette units/drawers.

The views on the side of the Forum are to die for and they go quickly. We had a living room with eat in kitchen with a flat panel TV that moved out at 90\u00b0 from the wall - convenient when the couch was set at 90\u00b0 from the TV. The water in the fridge is yours for free (oooh) and the robes (without hoods) and slippers (small - like Italian feet) are not for yours to keep. The bedroom is large and weirdly, only there do you have Sky with another flat panel TV. The bad. I am NOT the first to mention this, but the breakfast is an absolute joke. I mean, if this is a 4 star hotel/residence, what are they doing serving tiny, not very tasty pastries and that's about it! The juices are in these quite elegant silver decanters, but with NO LABELS you have no idea what is inside - pour and DISCOVER! There is fresh bread (good), but the selection of jams is bad, bad, bad. There was a crostata that looked good, but I didn't have it. There was also real fresh fruit salad - good, but when it ran out ... that was it ... no more fresh fruit salad. There was also some yogurt and small boxes of Kellogs brand cereal. Then there were two bottles of water. That's it. Breakfast is served! I hope this description gives you the idea that their breakfast was of the 2 star quality, not 4 star quality that they have been awarded. Last complete was our check-in.

I stayed here with my cousin through a timeshare exchange and I would highly recommend it to others for exchange or rental. We were in a one bedroom unit, with a wonderful large king sized bed in the bedroom and a pull out loveseat in the living room, both of which were extremely comfortable. There was plenty of dresser and closet space and a very convenient safe. The entire hotel has been recently renovated and it feels and looks fresh and new. The kitchen facility is definitely minimalist, with no microwave and a tiny bar type refrigerator. There is a small two burner cookstove, and a couple of pots and pans and some dishware. No microwave but a small dishwasher. We make tea every night and generally snack on cheese and such so we didn\u2019t need much but still we used the kitchen. There was no dishwashing material and when I requested it, I got a large container of liquid detergent and an old sponge with a scrubby. Well, it did the job\u2026 There is a very nice HD TV set but it gets only Italian TV \u2013 no CNN or BBC news, so of limited use to English speakers. Wireless internet costs E9 per day, which seems a bit much. It really seems as if internet should be like a TV and such - just a standard part of the accommodation but not so here. The front desk staff is really super friendly and helpful and they all speak perfect English. They are happy to be helpful about arranging taxis and such and will cheerfully look up information for you about various goings on. The hotel is near the river and the old, historic section of town. It is a goodly distance from the train station and a hike to the metro, but many buses run on the street nearby. Its location is a bit obscure when you first arrive \u2013 it is up the steps from a historic arch or approachable on a cobblestone road that is often blocked by parked cars. You can get bus information from the maps or buy a bus map from a tobacco stand. Everyone likes to tell you in Italy that the bus maps are changing but since everything is printed on old signs at the bus stops that don\u2019t seem to change, I think they just don\u2019t want to give away free maps when they are being sold at local stands. The tourist information stand outside the Termini is friendly and helpful and the hotels and TI have excellent free maps and you can rely on them for good information and the bus info on those maps worked just fine. Breakfast is served daily at the hotel \u2013 it was not included in my rate and after I checked it out, I did not think it was worth E12.5 per day. There just seemed to be some coffee and a few pastries. There is not much to eat very close by. Around the corner up the hill is a farmer\u2019s market and there are some sandwich/pastry shops and such in walking distance, but you must really cross the Tiber and wander into the Trastavere to find a decent restaurant \u2013 that is an easy walk but you do have to brave several busy Rome streets without the help of traffic lights!

We had one of our worst experiences staying in this hotel. The room we were assigned to was not at all like the pictures provided. Maybe some of the rooms in the hotel where renovated but certainly not the one we stayed in. Our room was dark, depressing and extremely outdated and old. The carpet was thread bare and the beds were rock hard. I have never slept on such a hard, unappealing bed in my life. The bathroom was also outdated and had noticeable mould between the mirror and the wall. We asked the front desk immediately to change or upgrade our room. On our initial day and each day after we were told that the hotel was full. My son was given a tiny cot to sleep on for 4 nights. He is 6 foot. There is no way that the room we were given would accommodate 4 adults....let alone 3. We found a sewing needle in the carpet by the bed that luckily no one in my family stepped on. We were given one bar of tiny soap for 3 people for 4 nights. When I inquired if we could have a second bar for the bath I was told that that is not their policy. One night a light in my sons sleeping/living area malfunctioned (it lit up the room every 2- 4 minutes). Upon calling the front desk at 1:00 am and then finally dressing and going down to the front desk at 3:00 am we finally had the desk clerk correct the situation (he put a chair on the table and unscrewed the light bulb.....never to replace it while we were there) We felt at times like we were imposing as we were \"timeshare\" guest. The breakfast consisted....daily...of stale cereal, dry cakes and fruit. On our last morning, upon check-out we were given a bill for 84.00 Euros for breakfast. Naturally I tried to argue but too no avail. I was led to believe that breakfast was included. They said simply to \"take our complaint to Royal Holiday\".

First day we walked to Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps etc. Second day we did the Vatican (was an hour walk but along the water so was quite nice). Third day we did the Colosseum (which is closest to the hotel). Capitol hill with great buildings are also nearby. We would walk in the mornings, come back for a rest and then go to the Jewish quarter for dinner. Very safe area. There is a small corner store with snacks and wine, but not much else. We found a street cart nearby that sold cheese and tomato panini's and we'd have that for breakfast. We picked up some groceries when we went to Trevi fountain, so were able to have eggs, bread etc. The thing we appreciated the most was the helpful concierge. We didn't get his name, but he was a younger guy with a beard. He was so helpful and did everything to make our stay so easy. Definitely the best service we experienced on our Italian holiday. If you want a bit of extra space (rare in Rome) and want to be able to walk to all the destinations and still be away from all the hype and noise, this is your hotel. The only thing we would change on our trip is we would make reservations for the Vatican before we got to Rome! I'd make it for anytime after 11 to avoid the opening time line up. We had to line up for 3 hours and when we got to the gate, the reservation line was nearly empty.

My husband needed reliable internet access to keep in touch with work and we needed space that we could share with our 2 boys. I found the right place with this hotel and I can't say enough good things about it. The management, the four folks who work at the desk, and the housekeepers -- each and every one of them -- make it an absolutely fantastic place to stay. Two of the folks working at the desk have been at Velabro for more than 20 years (one for 30). That says alot about the hotel. We've traveled around the world and stayed in 5 star hotels most of the time, including Park Hyatt, Four Seasons, Mandarin Oriental, and most recently, San Clemente Palace in Vienna. None of them have better service than this hotel -- the attitude at Velabro is welcoming, helpful, and beyond comparision. It's refreshing to be served by staff who do not constantly have their hands out for tips but instead simply consider it their job to make sure you are comfortable. They notice everything you need and respond without you asking. It's a small community that is very positive and professional. The hotel has one common entrance that is locked but monitored continuously to let in guests as they walk up. Even after my husband left, and I stayed for several weeks here alone with my young children, I felt very safe -- and very cared for. I can't begin to detail the things this hotel did for us. The wonderful fresh hot chocolate for the boys in the morning, the free videos for them to watch in the room (in English), or the endless bandaids and antiseptic they applied to the boys \"hurts\" from the streets of Rome -- it was wonderful. Each person who works here is cheerful, anticipates your needs before you ask ,and gives above and beyond. You literally feel at home. Each person we ran into at this hotel is a genuinely good person and genuinely enjoys other people. The apartments are spacious. There is a kitchenette with dishes and linens and they even supplied dishwashing liquid. There is plenty of space in the refrigerator for you to stock it yourself. If you use the drinks, etc. that the hotel supplies, they don't price gouge. Don't worry about the lack of room service. You have your own kitchen. There is a great market around the corner with fresh baked bread, fresh top quality produce, and cold cuts. Also, in the evening, folks at the desk ordered food for us from a great local restaurant at extremely reasonable prices. If you are rude and demanding, upset by small things that don't matter (like shower curtains), don't stay here. This hotel is not for you. If you love life and people and you appreciate the things that really matter, there can be no better place than Velabro. This hotel is clean, safe, and dependable. It's professional, reliable, and unsurpassed. If I lived in Rome, I can think of no better place to live than to live in this hotel. (And, actually, I'm pretty picky and demanding).

We had booked a two bedroom apartment, and expected to find a single apartment with two bedrooms. Instead, we were delighted to find two separate apartments with a common front door. Each apartment had a huge living area, a kitchenette (fridge and cook top), bathroom (with bathtub/shower and beday), bedroom (with TV), 2 large closets and a safe deposit box. The front desk staff (especially Luigi and Walter) were excellent. They were kind enough to book taxis for us, recommend modes of transport to/from our destinations, and help order our meals over the phone (in Italian). Our booking included breakfast, which was served (buffet style) in a small room next to the front desk. Pastries, cereal, fresh fruit, juices, coffee/tea were continually restocked, and were absolutely delicious. Conveniently located next to the Roman Forum, the Residence Palazzo Al Velabro was a 10 min taxi ride to the Spanish Steps, 15 min taxi ride to the Vatican, and a 20 min walk across the bridge to Trastevere. The only drawbacks were the shower curtain (which stuck to you when having a shower), and the absence of a clock and a dishwasher.

The apartment was clean, although thread-worn, and it was refreshed daily. The kitchen was missing wine glasses and an oven would have been nice - but it wasnt necessary. The bathroom really was the biggest disappointment - it was in real need of renovation, and was uncomfortable since it had a strong draft that blew cold air on your feet when stepping out of the narrow shower. But, there was plenty of hot water, and clean towels provided every day. The staff was pleasant and helpful. A bottle of champagne was delivered to our room on New Years Eve - that was a nice surprise. The location was close enough to restaurants, with a small store and coffee shop very close by.

Arrived to discover that I had failed to change our reserved dates and the hotel expected us a week earlier. They couldn't have been nicer about it, found us a suite and didn't charge us for the missed night. We had a 2 room suite, living area with kitchenette and bedroom. Kitchen had 4 burner cooktop, small frig & microwave. Lots of dishes, although no wineglasses--kind of odd for Italy. Bed was 2 twins pushed together, but comfortable with nightstands and lamps on both sides. Tv in bedroom with VCR player, although we never used that feature. Loads of closet space in our unit. Three big windows that opened and views over the piazza. We were told we had a very nice apartment, so the others may not have the same window setup. The carpet and upholstery are old but that didn't detract from the comfort. The bathroom had a tub and \"american-type\" shower--hurray! Tub somewhat narrow, so the curtain liked to attach itself to you, but only a small problem. There is a small terazza on the first (second American) floor with three tables so you can sit outside. Our room had a safe deposit box. Liked the accessibility from the location. Nice little bar around the corner for delicious morning cappuchino. Easy to get to Trastevere (used the bridges over the island so you can get traffic lights to cross the road along the Tiber) and the Jewish Ghetto.
