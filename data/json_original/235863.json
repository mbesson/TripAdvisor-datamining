You simply feel at home surrounded by old wooden furniture. The welcoming staff is extremely friendly. Breakfast is served in a salon filled with photographs of local beauties from the family's previous photo business. Notice the tables and chairs that seem to come from a doll's house!!! Too cute! Why did we pick that hotel among all others? because of its garden, a peaceful private green enclosure in this stone city. The hotel also offers free internet (but be careful as we got hacked...after all it is Venice) and a gym. We got the family suite with its own entrance. The suite is composed of 2 rooms and 2 bathrooms. Like the chairs and the tables, the bathtubs come from the same doll's house.

Last time I was in Venice I was a starving graduate student staying in hostels so this seemed fine enough and the location could not have been better, right next to piazza San Marco. We chose a larger room for 220 euros per night since we are familiar with the space constraints of European hotels although I saw the smaller rooms and they seemed fine enough for the price (much lower than our rate for larger room). However, I chose hotel Flora specifically because they have a gym but that was a bit disappointing. Perhaps Hotel Flora can charge more for the fact they have a gym but there is only one treadmill and it is reserved for their private training clients and we could never get on it. Next time, I would book a room in Venice through a third party engine to get better comparative pricing for the area. Breakfast was great and they have a lovely garden but it was too cold to enjoy it. Basic things like the size of the seats in the breakfast room may not work for the average American and the bathrooms are tiny no matter want room you get. The staff was nice and informative directing us to restaurants, tours and taxis. We ate at the restaurant across the street, la Caravalla at the hotel Albergo Saturnia and would consider staying there next time. They have nicer common areas and slightly nicer rooms for less money during the winter. Their restaurant and cocktail area adds a lot to the experience albeit expensive but it is Venice after all! Hotel Flora could easily be better than other hotels at it's price point in the area by making some slight improvements to the amenities that have, especially the gym which is in a beautiful building next door. Adding another treadmill to the gym, adding directional signs to find the gym. Adding more pillows for the rooms, at least the larger rooms and updating the bathrooms a bit to include new hair dryers.

Unlike some of the other Trip Advisor reviewers, we were not disappointed. My wife and I, our two daughters and their husbands, and our baby granddaughter stayed here for 5 nights in early August. The hotel met our expectations perfectly. The garden was just as it looks on the Web site, a beautiful spot for breakfast. Yes, the breakfast is Continental, but it met our needs and had enough variety that we did not get bored returning for 5 successive mornings. The staff were extremely helpful with every question I came up with. Although I usually took the stairs, the elevator was very welcome at times. I thought the furnishings and decorations in all the public areas were lovely. The rooms were small, yes, but I thought the furnishings were nice and the bed very comfortable. The rooms were always very clean. The location is fantastic--a five-minute walk from Piazza San Marco along the busy and crowded Calle XXII Marzo, but the hotel is some 200 yards away at the end of a tiny, quiet side street, and returning to it after a busy, exhausting day of sightseeing always felt like returning to a peaceful oasis. And the wireless Internet always worked, which is more than I can say about some hotels. But here's the clincher for me. Honesty?! I made the reservations by email, and the hotel's confirmation promised us a Rick Steves discount. I didn't have a chance to review the amount we should have been charged when we checked out; I just signed the credit card charge slip and we left. When we got home, I discovered that the amount of the discount was 45 euros less than I thought it would be. With some trepidation, since I had signed the charge slip without a quibble, I emailed and asked that my account be credited for the additional amount. To my relief, they replied promptly, readily admitted their mistake, and gave me the credit on my credit card. I was very impressed with their honesty and willingness to make things right.

We all know and accept that Venice's uniqueness often requires compromise and a degree of understanding with accommodation standards in all categories. I was attracted to Hotel Flora due to its reputed charm, only to discover to my disappointment that it is one of those hotels that features beautiful rooms on its website which do not match reality! I stayed at the hotel for 5 nights in a spartan, single room (200 Euros per night) and in my view, the hotel is tired and needs refurbishment. The room was shabby with cheap, spartan furnishings, dirty walls and with small stained, threadbare rugs on the timber floor. The bathroom was tiny (as are most in Venice) with a cracked handbasin and toilet flush mechanism that fell apart every time it was used. The bed was one of the worst I have slept in at any hotel - ever. It comprised two very short single mattresses pushed together on a double base to form a very small double bed. The mattresses were raised at the centre join and sloped down towards the sides, so you constantly had the sensation that you were going to roll off the edge of the bed. The mattress was hard, lumpy and uneven and two pillows provided were old, hard and flat in the middle from overuse. I am average height but the bed was too short for me. Both bed and pillows were way past replacement date!! Perhaps worse - the wall adjoining the next room was so thin that I could clearly hear all conversations and activity (you can use your imagination here) of the two guests next door. This was disgraceful and really unacceptable. The buffet breakfast was sparse and with very few choices and many very basic breakfast items that were included on the buffet of other hotels I had stayed in within this category had to be ordered and paid for as \"extras\" and they were not cheap. (For example: Ham 8 Euros, scrambled eggs 6 Euros, Bacon and eggs 8 Euros, Salami 7 Euros, etc.) This gave an impression of meanness and money-grabbing. On a more concerning note, my room was on the top floor of a wing at the end of a corridor with no exit. In the event of a fire, I would have had no escape route.

Our accommodation was the family \u00e2\u20ac\u0153suite\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd; two very small adjacent rooms with two bathrooms. The small part I could live with since European hotels are sometimes like that although these were miniscule. However small spaces can certainly be fresh and charming, but unfortunately these rooms were not. Both of the bathrooms had peeling paint and cracked tiles. The door handle in the smaller bathroom fell off the door repeatedly; once I was locked in. The curtains, rugs and furniture are in serious need of updating. The rugs in particular need to be changed. Shabby, depressing, and run down would properly describe our rooms.

I wanted my 11 year old granddaughter to feel our trip was special but instead I was mortified that I had chosen the Hotel Flora. When we checked out I suggested the management take a walk upstairs for a hard look at our rooms.

To my surprise, the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcs Trip Advisor responses seem to focus on how serious they are about the hotel and to blame the guests for not letting them know about these problems. Asking for extra towels is one thing but it is not the responsibility of the guest to inform the management of cracked tiles, dirty rugs, and peeling paint. The management needs to be concerned with and on top of that constantly. Restaurant recommendations were simply non -existent.

Take the water bus to San Marco Vallaresso, take a right at Harry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bar, a left at the end of the street, haul your bag over the bridge at San Moise (said to be the ugliest church in Venice, if not in Italy), and turn left down the small alley just past the Bulgari store. And there it is, the Hotel Flora. I stayed there in 1985 on my first visit to Venice, and not much has changed. I booked a single room, knowing that it would be small (and it was!). But then, I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there to spend time in a hotel room. It's got a nice bed, a shower, a TV (mostly Italian) and air conditioning. What more does a single woman need? One reason I chose to come back to the Hotel Flora is that you can have a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153light dinner\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd served by the bar manager (Vennichio). I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind traveling alone, but I really don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like going out for dinner alone, so this was a perfect solution. Vennichio gives me the dinner options, I select the time, and I have a little table in the garden or lounge for my dinner. On my first night, I was the only one dining this way, and enjoyed my gnocchi with artichokes and insalata mista, with a bellini to start, at 9pm. The humidity was very high, and the mosquitoes discovered that I was in the garden, so I slipped inside after finishing dinner, and sat in the lounge with a glass of prosecco to do some reading. The lounge is like an old style parlour, with leaded glass windows, old area rugs, ornate red upholstered furniture, wood spindle tables, lace doilies, Murano glass chandeliers and velvety fabric wallpaper. Oh yes, and air conditioning!!! I found out that most of the staff have been here for many years, and likely were the same people serving me 25 years ago (including Vennichio and the front desk manager). In fact, Vennichio commented that he probably tried to pick me up 25 years ago. I said, \"No, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think so -- I was here with a man. But then, you are Italian, so maybe you did try!\" As I was coming down the stairs from my room for breakfast a couple of days later (they make perfect cappuccinos and the garden is amazingly beautiful), I heard the man at the front desk saying to the breakfast manager something about \"bella donna\" and \"quattordici\" (my room number is 14). I love this hotel! Others were asked for their room number, but they treated me like a queen. Although traveling solo can be lonely at times, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s times like at the Hotel Flora that makes it a great way to go!

The booking was handled very professionally and promptly, and when I sent an email to ask for a quiet room, they replied almost immediately to say they would make sure I got a nice room, that was very nice of them. I booked a deluxe double for myself and it was luxurious, a treat. The hotel is only a 5 minute walk from the closest vaporetto stop, and off a posh shopping street, the lane being next to the Bulgari shop, no less. It was a welcoming sight, with the ivy (?) hanging off the walls and their garden just like it is shown on the website. In fact the hotel is nicer than what the pictures show - it is brighter, and we were never bothered by birds. The airconditioning (important in the summer) worked perfectly, and the staff were always attentive and friendly., especially the breakfast staff. Upon arrival, check in was smooth. My room was on the third floor, it looked into the garden, it was quiet, had lovely shutters for the night, one of the the cleanest bathrooms I've seen in Europe, and of a good size. Brilliant shower. The bed was a queen, good mattress (firm) , the TV worked and the room was well lit. Perfect, I could not have asked for more. The public areas were also well-kept, clean, and no-smoking throughout. The hotel and my room were both great to return to, when it got too hot or for an afternoon rest before dinner. The room was always made up perfectly whenever I returned to it, and they sprayed it witha lovely scent too. The hotel is near everything. In the morning, you would be woken up by the sound of birds chirping. Breakfast (if you managed to drag yourself out of bed in time) was a generous selection of breads, eggs, yoghurt, juices, fruit, whatever your morning beverege, toast do-it-yourself. In a cheerful breakfast room off the garden, and you could choose to sit outside if you wanted to. There was free wi-fi, and also paid internet PC off the lobby, which was very convenient, and worth the money (I am not good with fiddling with blackberries). No problems with connection. There's no restaurant but they can make you a hot meal or a sandwich if you really need to stay in. If there is one criticism, that was with restaurant recommendations. They didn't seem to want to recommend the really good ones - Fodors gives pretty accurate reviews - we tried 4 of Fodors' recommendations and they all hit home. So read up and just make your own choices. You really do not need to go to the overpriced Alla Madonna to be ushered into a room that is reserved for tourists, to be served mediocre food by indifferent waiters. We would recommend without hesitation in order of ranking: 1. Vini da Gigio - it is very special - do not miss! 2. Osteria ae Sconte - lovely and romantic , and reasonable 3. Al Paradiso - lovely setting, choose carefully, better for seafood than it is for meats. All had great wines. We spent about 150 Euros including a nice bottle of red for two of us, and we ate very well , and felt that the prices were very fair, considering that Venice is an expensive city. In summary: a) say that you want a quiet room overlooking the garden b) a deluxe double is a very comfortable size for one person c) the breakfast and internet really make a difference d) the hotel is totally ROMANTIC, very clean and very safe for a solo lady traveller even e) Absolutely loved the Flora, Loved Venice, Can't wait to return !

Staff was delightful, accommodating and helpful -- and everyone spoke excellent English. Breakfast in the garden was magical. The birds flying around are perhaps a bit of a nuisance but totally add to the atmosphere. My son gorged on yogurt and ham and fresh fruit. They served him a beautiful cup of rich hot chocolate. Our coffee came with hot steamed milk. Our triple room was large enough, clean and bright, looking out on to the garden. Absolutely silent at night. Air conditioning was fine. And windows open so we had a choice of air or no air. We were in a family group of 10. My brother's family stayed in the \"family room\" which was not as pretty as ours -- the kids' room was small for 3 and a bit stale smelling. But asa family they had two rooms and two bathrooms in a suite which was great for the five of them. My parents' double( immediately below our triple) was very spacious (same as triple just without the cot) and decorated in a similarly elegant style. (Pretty typical of Venice from what I can see) My parents enjoyed a delightful dinner in the garden one night. And while they took all the grandkids on a gondola ride, we relaxed with spritz cocktails in that same quiet, cool, peaceful oasis. Upon arrival, a porter picked us up at the water taxi spot and led us through narrow alleyways to the hotel. Two porters helped schlep our bags back to the water taxi upon departure. The desk staff recommended restaurants, helped with directions, maps, phone calls, interenet etc. Always pleasant.

It was in Venice that I was going to pose that matrimonial question and I had the image of how I wanted to orchestrate the evening, but I was going to need help with some details leading up to \"the ask\". The staff at Hotel Flora (Giovanni in particular) were just the perfect resource and they had no idea of my agenda. They just were doing their job as only they know how. \"I need a romantic restaurant for the two of us this evening.\" \"How Romantic?\" \"Very\" \"I have two choices, \" he replied as he gave me a fairly detailed overview while showing me locations on the map. He dialed immediately to secure a reservation while we waite. The one I selected at his recommendation was spot-on perfect for a dinner of this significance. 4-Star Gourmet ++. Quiet. Out of the tourist traffic. Modern, yet warm and intimate. As we sat at a corner table, a jacketed waiter flicked his lighter to ignite a long candle taper on our table. And from that point on it was surprise after surprise. A young husband and wife own and operate the establishment. As a sommolier he matched a wine to our appetizers and entre' selections. Now the lone required component to this evening was a gondola ride where I could ask the question in a quiet Venetian canal. It's not peak tourist season so these gondoliers pack up early. The couple who owned the restaurant summoned a personal friend who is a gondolier, and he agreed to meet us at the restaurant; walk to his gondola and at 10:30pm at night we were the lone boat traffic in the canals near San Marco. It could not have been better scripted...until the gondolier dropped us off at the Hotel Daniele (See movie: The Tourist)...told us to buy one celebratory drink at the bar and just soak in the history and architecture of the lobby. As the piano player tickled the keys with a romantic ballad, our evening was complete and a success. It started with my friend Giovanni at Hotel Flora. We picked this hotel for these great features: we had access to use a health club next door...great perk when traveling two weeks without some fitness break (for us)...close to a water bus stop (key for luggage transporting through the streets...very close)...great breakfasts...historic rooms/cozy size/clean/all we needed to keep our bags, shower and sleep...quaint courtyard to sip a cocktail or glass of wine before dinner...great little bar and sitting room...computer access (fee...but reasonable)...centrally located to any sightseeing or shopping or dining you care to experience.

The bed was fabulous and we both slept great. The desk agent on the morning shift was the sweetest man ever (his evening colleague not so much). Details: shower is small but amazing water pressure, everything else is pretty standard. Remember, they don't use top sheets in Europe (they're the best sheets in the world!) - just down comforters - no big deal just thought I'd mention it. The location of the hotel is not too far from the San Marco vaporetto stop. As a side note, wear flat shoes as it's easier to navigate on the cobbled streets and up and down the little bridges over the canal. The breakfast, included in our stay, was really yummy - you can select what you want and have it delivered to your room (they phone you about 5 mintues before they come up) or you can eat downstairs in their little cafe.

I arrived-after a long search to find the hotel which is located down a narrow dead-end kind of street-in the morning, and my room was not ready. Ok, fine, understood. Upon check in the front desk clerk asked for my passport, wrote down the information in it, and then insisted on keeping it until my room was ready, which made me really uncomfortable. I didn't then and still don't understand why, but I reluctantly agreed and left it with him. A few hours later, I returned and was given keys (yes keys) and shown to my room. First off, the key chain had a heavy door knocker attached that weighed about 3 lbs., and I'm not exaggerating here. Since my backpack was heavy already, I immediately removed this from the chain. Attached also, was a skeleton key for the safe (later on that). As soon as I opened the door to my room, I was unhappy. The room was very tiny-the bed almost ended at the bathroom door-and the decor was really in need of an update. I felt like I was in some weird cabin in the woods rather than in Venice, Italy. There were dark wooden shelves on both sides of the beds for your clothes, covered by a gold somewhat musty curtain. The shower was another story. The only way I can describe it is \"small space capsule\". If you've ever had a closed MRI you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d know what I mean. I felt like I was standing in a pizza oven. I kept thinking that a large person could never shower in that room because as slim as I am I was having a difficult time moving around. Next, the safe. You could fit a wallet in it, and nothing else. The lock chamber on the back of the door to the safe was so thick it took up most of the space! I was always squeezing things in there and still had to carry the rest with me since there was never any room. Honestly, it was the tiniest safe I've ever seen. The only thing that was big was the key to it! When I returned to the lobby I asked if I could upgrade to a bigger/nicer room and very politely expressed my dislike for my current accommodations. I was told nothing was or would become available. I was perfectly willing to pay for a room like the one shown on the website-which by the way is the only one like it, I think, and the answer was no. I honestly think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because I was traveling alone and they wanted/needed one of those rooms for two people. I saw many room keys dangling from the shelf behind the clerk at the reception desk, but my key was noticeably vacant because my room was occupied!! I settled for my fate and since it was only two days I thought I could live with it, but when I thought of the rate I paid, I was even more upset. This little single room cost me nearly 320 Euros (nearly $500 USD) and wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worth that at all. Two days later I stayed in a beautiful hotel in Florence for two nights that cost $252 Euros ($354) and had a room twice the size and breakfast fit for a king (later on that great review). Now breakfast. It was included, but thanks for nothing. It was the cheapest continental breakfast I've ever seen. Usually in Europe continental breakfast will include lunch meats, cheeses and scrambled eggs. None of this here, but they did have a small dish of hard-boiled eggs, so I do have to mention that. There's an outside garden but I sat inside, and there were birds flying inside and perching on the cereal dispensers eating the droppings people left behind. They were probably the only happy ones. That was really disgusting-not to mention unhealthy-and no one said a word or did anything. I mentioned Rick Steves\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 recommendation again at checkout time because according to his book you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get a 20% discount for doing so. Completely untrue! When I asked, I was told that I already had the lowest discount, so no. Meanwhile, this was the regular price so I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what discount they were talking about. I paid the more for this hotel than any other in Italy, and yet I liked it less than any other! Every time I headed back to the hotel I dreaded going there and I never felt like it was an extension of my home or had a warm and nice feeling when I was there. I traveled this time without a laptop so the only positive thing I have to say is that they charge only 3 Euros for \u00c2\u00bd hour, but considering Milan and Florence offered free internet, again, really, thanks for nothing! Please do your research and look for a better hotel. During my last trip to Venice I stayed at The Saturnia, which oddly enough is located directly across from Hotel Flora.

For this second visit, we reserved a four (4) night stay in a superior double. However, later on we chose to arrive in Venice two (2) nights earlier than originally planned, which resulted in an inconvenience of having to move after the first two nights. Still, the inconvenience was of our own doing; it all worked out fine and we were generally happy with our second stay at the Flora. The room we stayed in for the first two (2) nights was pretty but very-very small; however, we were warned by the management that this is what it would be so no surprises there. As indicated above, after the first two (2) nights, we were transferred to room no. 28, which was absolutely gorgeous with a large antique bed, the softest linens and dawn comforters, and a high ceiling with dark wood beams. The room had beautiful wood furnishings, hardwood floors, and floor rugs. It also had two windows overlooking a palazzo across the garden. Even though rather small with not much space to arrange one's necessities or to move around, the bathroom was newly remodeled. In all honesty, though, the room was just beautiful and I would recommend asking for it specifically. Flora also serves a very nice breakfast, consisting of several varieties of breads and croissants, hard and soft boiled eggs, cheeses, yogurts, and pastry. A huge plus is that the Flora, unlike other hotels in Italy, serves a fresh fruit salad every morning. Somewhat of a minus is that a glass of orange juice is served from the kitchen, as opposed to being a part of the breakfast buffet, and it is quite obviously diluted with water. The morning wait staff is extremely helpful and attentive, and will look out for when one's cappuccino is finished so that they could offer a second cup. We were also fortunate enough to score one warm and sunny morning and have breakfast in the garden of the hotel. As far as the front desk personnel, some of them are more accommodating than others, as is the case with anything else in life, and we did notice that one of the front desk attendants was treating guests with a polite tolerance rather than genuine hospitality. Another issue, I would mildly caution against a blind acceptance of Flora's dining recommendations, since the recommended restaurants were only o.k. As far as my recommendations for a good meal, I would suggest the following three and would warn against dining at a fourth: Birraria la Corte, San Polo, Tel.: [--], has a menu full of wonderful offerings. However, we stuck to the recommended by a friend arugula salad with thin slices of pecorino cheese all drizzled with chestnut honey, and pizza with porcini mushrooms and wild boar salami. Delicious! Since we were walking all of those calories off, we treated ourselves to a dessert of pana cota with caramello and were ready to lick the plate if no one would notice. We enjoyed a great lunch at Alla Madonna, Calle Della Madonna, San Polo, Tel. [--]. Unfortunately, they do not take reservations and this is the reason we chose to have lunch rather than dinner when the restaurant gets much busier. Both of us had a plate of pasta (I had the best spaghetti with squid ink) and we shared an appetizer of proscutto and melone.

The space was truly beautiful and what I imagined a venetian bedroom would be like. I did have a nose in another room next to ours which was considerably small and pokey - rather surprising. I think the key is to book in this smaller hotel but only go if you get one of the best rooms. Service - Very pleasant, helpful but not as fantastic as others have made out. Breakfast - We had breakfast delivered to our rooms as the lounge area downstairs really wasn't that great. I understand the norm is to have it in the courtyard, which is pretty, but too wet in winter. Consisted of cereal, croissants, OJ and tea. Very simple, not a great choice or fantasically fresh, but fine for us. So, in all, I would definately recommend this but only if you get the best room.

Charming, very pretty, great location. Website's photos are very representative of hotel. Just 2-3 minutes from St. Mark's Square and the St. Mark's Square vaporetto exit (and thankfully, only one bridge with steps cross), and on a well marked alleyway just off the \"Rodeo Drive\" of Venice, the Via 22 Marzo, not that street names mean anything here. Totally by luck, my vanDam StreetSmart Venice map that I had brought with me had the Hotel Flora marked on it. So, I actually knew how to find the hotel (not an easy thing in Venice!) Venice was horribly hot, so we appreciated the best AC we've ever had! Lots of Americans here. After our long, hot journey via train and overcrowded vaporetto feeling cranky and weary from lugging our overstuffed bags thru the crowded streets of Venice, we turned the corner to the charming alleyway well marked by the \"Hotel Flora\" sign from above, the bellman opened the door and walked down to meet us as if they were expecting us. The bellman took our bags from us and ushered us into the well air-conditioned lobby. Indeed they were expecting us as the concierge greeted us by name, quickly checked us in and had the bellman efficiently escort us to our comfortably cooled room. (OK, that's the limit of my journalistic stylings.) The room and bathroom were incredibly tiny, but we did only reserve a standard room. There really wasn't any room for our bags without climbing over them. But, the bed and comforters were just the best. The hot/cold water were plentiful. There was American Kleenex brand facial tissue which was a strange but nice comfort to have! The toiletries and towels were lush. Our 180 euro room was tiny #29 (on the 3rd floor not the 2nd!) and overlooked the lovely courtyard. Judging by the hotel map, looks like larger rooms were available. The included breakfast was nicely continental, and more substantial items like eggs or prosciutto with melon could be ordered and were reasonably priced. The servers remembered us and our food preferences everyday! The concierges were very polite and helpful and gently encouraged us to ask them for help and recommendations with a very non-intrusive \"what are you doing today?\" And then would very politely encourage us to do other things if they thought it would be too crowded and would produce maps and recommendations (my husband wanted to go to St. Mark's first thing in the morning, but the concierge managed to rightly convince him that going in the less crowded afternoon would be better). Again, the concierges were outstanding. Ok, a plus, but in conversing with one of them, found we may be distantly related cousins as his wife and my husband are from the same village in Shanghai of all places. You need a login ID and password from the concierge which is doled out in unfortunately small time increments for the free internet (We'd get only 1/2 hour increments, but I'm sure if we asked for a longer increment, we'd have gotten it.) I'd definitely stay here again for the charm, wonderful staff, great location, beautiful courtyard, comfy beds, best-in-class AC, free wireless internet, totally worth it price, all totally making up for our tiny room (which sort of grew on us).

This hotel is in a terrific location, with friendly staff, but the rooms were on the small and tired side, and my bathroom was dated and cramped -- I couldn't actually stand up straight in the shower.
