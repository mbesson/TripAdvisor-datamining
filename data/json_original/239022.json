The wifi in the room worked well. One problem was that, as one often finds in older buildings, there was a very bad smell coming from the toilet in the bathroom. The management had put two solid deodorant things there to try to help, but I think that may have made things worse. Of course there was a door to the bathroom, but the bottom was not flush (no pun intended) with the floor so some smell would always escape. There was a window right in front of the bathroom door, which we left partly open, and that helped. We found the hotel quiet enough--there was a little shouting and dog barking in the night, but for the most part things were quiet. There are several nice restaurants nearby. We did not have the hotel breakfast. Since we have stayed in this hotel before, we know that not all rooms have this smell problem.

Help-yourself breakfast was well worth it - lots of choices from scrambled eggs to yogurt and fruit- and served in a beautiful room overlooking the garden. Our room overlooked the street, which could be a little noisy with the trams and local traffic, so if you're used to quiet, request a room at the back of the hotel. The room was clean with up-to-date bathroom and hairdryer and all amenities. I was able to borrow an adapter from the front desk for the duration of our stay for my other electrical appliances. Friendly neighborhood bars and restaurants serve excellent food, and the hotel has an agreement with them in case their guests want room service.. This hotel does not offer cookie-cutter type rooms, so if you're looking for a Hilton, please go to a Hilton. This is a charming hotel, with each room decorated differently honoring the legacy of Rembrandt. Well stocked library in the lobby and computer for guests' use. All in all everything we needed to make our stay in Amsterdam special. My only negative: common areas (hallways, etc.) getting slightly worn, and I didn't like the fact that the vacuum cleaner was stored in a corner outside my door - but that is being really picky!

Tram #9 is literally steps away from the hotel, so quite handy, it's about a 10-15 minute run from the train station. There are quite a few steps, both getting into the hotel, and to get to your room - not much fun with large suitcases, but once we got to our room we were fine. I can't recall the specific room # we had, but it was a small double. The room was on the small side, but we found the bed to be a bit larger than a double and the room had a mini-fridge which was handy to store some cheese and fruits which we would purchase from the supermarket about 10 minutes away. The room also had a large window, which looked out onto the back of the property so we were able to get some nice fresh air as the first couple days were rather warm in AMsterdam. The front desk staff were always friendly and helpful, and there was free internet available both in the room and at a computer in the lobby area. There was an ATM right across the road to the left when exiting the hotel, so that was handy. So generally we were satisifed with the room and the hotel. We found plenty of reasonably priced restaurants in the Remrandtplein area -- we ate at an Irish pub and an Italian pizza place there the first 2 nights. Our other meals we ate in the Leidesplein area, and these were quite good as well -I would particularly recommend Be Blauwe Hollander where we had some traditional Dutch fare - very hearty and tasty!

We had room 16, third floor, the stairs are a bit of a challenge, but we had a great view and the room (it is the blue one) was lovely - big, nicely decorated and a very comfy bed. The wi-fi works great. The only problem with the room was a weird smell coming from the bathroom, but we kept the door closed and that solved it. We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel, but the minibar prices were very reasonable. Also, we had dinner one day at the cafe just next to the hotel (cafe voogt or something like that). The food was indeed excellent there so we came back the next day for snacks and a glass of wine.

We were a party of five, with two kids under 6 years old. We liked the cosiness of the hotel. It is a small establishment and the staff at the reception are generally friendly and helpful. We got the largest room in the hotel which could accommodate 5 people - a single bed in the main room and 2 double beds upstairs. There is a rather steep staircase leading to these beds and initially, we were worried for our children's safety as they were excited about going up and down it. But with proper caution and warning plus parental supervision, they learnt to be extra careful and we weren't so worried once the 2nd day rolled around. We read several reviews of the hotel and when we read a review that said it was a quiet hotel, we were sold. We had arrived from Paris and were quite exhausted and a good night's sleep was what we sorely needed. However, that was not to be. I believe that compared to the other bigger hotels in the heart of Amsterdam (especially near Centraal Station and around Dam Square), Hotel Rembrandt would indeed be considered in a quiet area as it is away from the crowded, touristy places (which could get very, very crowded). The Plantage Middenlaan is quiet in general. However, we couldn't sleep because of 2 things mainly - the vehicles (cars, trams) travelling on the road right in front of the hotel (and our room faces that road) and the voices we heard at night which I later established to have come from cyclists chatting to each other as they passed by on the bike path (also in front of our hotel). Occasionally, there will be the siren sounds of an ambulance (whether the road leads to a hospital, I am not sure). I think that is the downside of this particular room - that it faces the main road. We are not overly upset about this because it is something which is structural and quite permanent. If you have the tendency to sleep like a log every night, then this wouldn't be a problem at all. But if like me, you are a light sleeper, then it would be problematic. We did not have breakfast in the hotel but in order to get to our room, we had to go through the dining room which we must say is a very beautiful room indeed. Well-maintained and kept. Do take advantage of the many small cards placed outside the reception. Some give discounts to some attractions. We managed to get 20% off per adult ticket to the Hortus Botanicus. We also saw some cards offering discounts to attractions such as the NEMO Centre and the Ann Frank House. There are some that offer dining discounts at certain eating establishments as well. The free wi-fi provided by the hotel is commendable. Do bring your laptops along if you wish but to travellers from countries who have different electricity outlet plugs than the European ones, be warned. Buy a European standard 3-to-2 plug adaptor. When we were in Paris, we borrowed one from the hotel. However, Hotel Rembrandt did not have one to lend us (at the time of our stay) and the only shop we found out that sells them is Aurora (somewhere in town). I was elated to finally purchase one only to find out that each was priced at around 13 Euros. It was daylight robbery - so I changed my mind. My laptop remained out of battery and I had to wait till we returned to London to charge it. There are tram stops outside the hotel. Very convenient. Nos. 9 and 14 are the trams to take if you need to get there (No.9 from Centraal).", "Date": "June 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cLovely little Hotel\u201d", "Author": "GreeceLoverLondon", "ReviewID": "UR109521028", "Content": "Easy to find from Central Station - just jump on a No 9 tram which stops almost outside.

Room was very spacious and bathroom lovely modern and all very clean. Furniture in room looks a little tired but no problem. Had mini fridge/bar which operated on an honest basis. Reasonably priced and when we told them we only had a bottle of water they didn't charge us. Room was cleaned daily and toiletries replaced where needed.. Quiet neighbourhood so perfect after a long day sightseeing. Didn't have breakfast so can't comment on it. Must hand key back to reception when you go out and if they need to leave reception unmanned for a few minutes for any reason they lock the front door which is sensible. Just ring bell if you need to get in and it's closed. There is a large supermarket about 10 mins walk - out of hotel turn right, over bridge then it's on the right hand side. Tram stops for nos 9 and 14 are literally outside the hotel which is so convenient. Amsterdam is a small city so everywhere is walkable but it time is an issue just jump on a tram - easy. We would recommend a GVB travelcard (buy at the station when you are. Leave the station at the main entrance and walk to the left and the office is across the road. It was 15.50 Euros for 72 hours unlimited travel on bus/tram/metro. There is also the i-amsterdam card which is more expensive but gives access to the canal bus and entrance to some museums. We did a boat cruise on the Blue Boat Tours (opp Hard Rock cafe). Anne Frank house - busy but amazing. Would recommend hotel and Amsterdam to everyone.

This means all rooms are unique (both in decor and size/layout), so some are nicer than others. Our party stayed in 4 rooms, all of which were different. The breakfast room is show-stopping, although the moden chairs and tables clash with the 17th century decor. Pros: Excellent staff: both friendly and helpful. Great location: convenient to a tram stop and walking distance from the centre. We stayed in Room 2 which was a lovely spacious room with an ensuite bathroom. The windows were huge and the ceiling was wonderfully high. The linens were clean and the room was comfortable. The shower was hot and powerful, the bathroom was modern and appeared recently re-done to a good standard, and it came stocked with 3 rolls of toilet paper (which is unusually generous), so no worries about running out! One thing I really appreciated: there was plenty of counter space around the sink to spread out toiletries and things, as well as a little shelf in the shower for shampoo, bodywash, and soap (so many hotels don't have this, leaving you with nowhere to put the soap except the floor), as well as sufficient towel hanging space in the form of a towel hanger in front of the sink and on the wall. There is a computer in reception as well as wifi. Cons: Walls were a bit thin (as can be expected for an old house) so we did sometimes hear noise from other rooms/the corridor. The house-to-hotel conversion could have been done better, as there are some awkward rooms which have not always made the best use of available space. Some of the decor seemed a bit dated--appearing to be from the 1980s. The curtains were the worst--they had an abstract pastel patten that did not match the room decor at all. The desk chair with woven wicker was a monstrosity that didn't match and couldn't fit under the desk, which was missing a drawer. The fake wood laminate flooring looked cheap and wasn't well installed. The tv (not flat screen) was quite small compared to the size of the room. The pillows were a bit lumpy. I didn't care for the breakfast buffet (the bread was lack-lustre and the cornflakes weren't \"proper\" cornflakes), and after the first day I didn't have any more, but that's a matter of personal taste, as the rest of our party enjoyed it immensely and helped themselves liberally every day.

The room and bathroom were nice and clean, with tea/coffee making facilities and a mini fridge with some drinks (which are to be paid for). Its not as up to date as some hotels (eg old style tv) but that wasn't an issue for us.

We were greeted by friendly staff and throughout our visit, every member of staff did their job with a smile and made us feel very welcome. There's a tram stop right outside the hotel (number 9 from Centraal station) or if you prefer to walk, it should take roughly 20 minutes. The hotel is situated in a quiet and attractive area close enough for us to make the most of the city, but also giving a welcome break from the hustle and bustle of the central areas. There are a handful of cafes and bars nearby (we found \"Eik En Linde\" just opposite the hotel to be very good indeed.) We were given room eleven on the second floor at the front of the hotel which was clean, comfortable and very spacious indeed. The large windows give way to a great view of the street outside, and while there is some noise from trams and people travelling to/from the city, we didn't have any problems. Room facilities are comfortable twin beds, a couch, table and chairs, writing desk, wardrobe, bedside tables,tv, tea and coffee making facilities and minibar. The dark laminate floor and furnishings contrasted well with the mint green walls, which made this an eye catching and relaxing environment to spend the night. The bathroom is big enough to do the job, with WC, sink and a large shower. Free Wi-Fi is also available throughout the hotel, which is a nice little bonus! There were a few areas for improvement as far as the bathroom was concerned: One of the lighbulbs in our bathroom was out and there was a slight smell (from the toilet brush I think). The shower was an exciting looking contraption with jets here, there and everywhere, but in practice it was best just used as a standard shower, possibly as the water pressure wasn't great. These are small things though, and certainly not enough to ruin our visit! Some friends of ours also stayed in the infamous \"Small Double Room\" (Room 1) which I have seen recieving negative reviews on this site in the past. Personally, I found it to be nicely decorated and quite cosy, I've certainly seen smaller hotel rooms! It does only have one door to the rear as a window, this leads out onto a rather pleasent semi-private garden, which our party made good use of. Overall, this is a friendly, comfortable and characterful hotel in a decent location.

I would definatley stay here again, usually i like being in the main area when i go away being a young twenty something but if i did there were parts of amsterdam i wouldnt of found the hotel area is really nice , theres a little park, a canal and even a zoo!!!", "Date": "August 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Yorkshire", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel in good safe location\u201d", "Author": "racingqueen", "ReviewID": "UR16620621", "Content": "I have just returned from this hotel and had a great stay.

My friend, a native of the Netherlands, came to visit me there and also liked the hotel. The only down side I saw was there is no lift and the stairs are quite steep and the location is a bit far from Central Station, but still within walking distance. I had severe jet lag while I was there and could not get to sleep at night as my room faced the street and the tram track, but it was nice to look out at the pedestrians.

(New Market, De Waag, Red Light District). The good thing is that you can walk around Amsterdam very easily. Breakfast was included in the cost of the room which was great, we stayed a week and were getting tired of the same breakfast items, so we ventured out into the city for an \"English Breakfast\" once or twice. Rolls, meat and cheese slices, fruit, hard-boiled eggs, granola-type cereals and milk / orange juice were available every morning. Service was great, the women working the front desk were very helpful. We were able to arrange for an airport taxi - they did all of it for us. They had internet access available for a few Euros. Room was small, but adequate for what we needed. Bathroom was especially nice. TV with Dutch and BBC channels, and a clock. Very very comfortable beds. No air conditioning which didn't bother us because it was chilly enough without it. It was very quiet from Sunday to Tuesday, but we woke up Wednesday morning to the sound of screaming children.

I must admit that my first impression was not the best though and it turned out to be wrong. What I found positive about this hotel is that its location is very good, it's situated close to the city center and you can either walk or take a tram (tram stop is just a hundred steps away from the hotel door) to get there. It's quietness and safety that you appreciate so much after spending time in crazy city center. First night I stayed in a double room, it was not that spacious but had everything one might need in it. The rest of nights I spent in a single room as requested and this room was very nice, more spacious, had a very clean bathroom and a very large window which I liked too. The only thing I wasn't comfortable with was kinda dark light, just would have prefered to feel the difference between room with light on and off. Breakfast was ok, there was all kinds of food you need in the morning, and yes, coffee was great. Of course dining room was amazing, it looked like an antique one. Unfortunately I didn't get much information from the staff on the building and dining room history, so have no idea if it's a genuine one but will keep thinking it is))).

The staff were very helpful and new english perfectly. The called our cab when we were leaving for the airport and knocked on our door to make sure we were up in time. The breakfast area was beautiful and the food was fresh and tasty. No bacon or eggs just good healthy food like fruit and assortment of cheese and ham and fresh bread. Cearl with milk or yougurt, boiled eggs and fresh coffee or tea. The room was a little run down and could probably use a little rennovations but for what we paid it was well worth it. Our room was a small double with a large window looking over on the backyard, you cold open the windows fully and step outside on a small balcony. The bathroom was great, clean and newly rennovated. Be warned that most channels on the Tv were in Dutch, which is understandable, but if you wanted to watch movies in English then you had to pay but it was fairly inexpensive.

Though it's a hotel, it felt more like a bed and breakfast, which was a nice surprise. When we got off the tram, I thought the place looked a bit shady with its overgrown unruly ivy, but the inside was just fine, warm and welcoming. We started in a small double in the basement or ground floor (hollywood theme) -- all yellow with basic furnishings, great bathroom and no problems except no windows to open for fresh air and unfortunate proximity to a room where a guest was smoking. There was a door leading out to the backyard, but we couldn't sleep with that open, as there wasn't a screen. We were later able to switch to a smaller small double right next to the breakfast room (the sunflower room). Though it was a tighter squeeze, we enjoyed having windows, lots of light and fresh air and a view of the backyard. Breakfast was pleasant and ample and offered in the hotel's flagship room. Rooms were cleaned each day and staff members were helpful. The location is quiet and residential but still convenient to public transportation, a cash machine and two quite good cafes for nights when you don't want to head to more tourist-laden areas. Waterlooplein is a 10-minute walk and other areas are not much farther. The hotel is next to a school, so the crowds of students may be a surprise if you happen to be there midday.

We'd booked a small double and were apologetically told when arriving that the double bed in the room was very small and we'd be moved to a bigger room the next day at no extra cost. We were presented with what looked like a large single bed in a room which was a homage to chip board and \"wood effect\" all rounded off with laminate floors that could have fooled no one. The whole room looked like a hostel on Earls Court Road. To be fair, the bathroom was clean and modern and obviously recently refurbished ( but why stop there...) Although this appears a quiet area by day its really noisy by night. The next day, as promised, we were moved into a bright double room with a little terrace over looking a rather wild garden. If you are offered a small double; I would ensure that it is one on the web site; the one we were allocated was dire.
