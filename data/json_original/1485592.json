The reception is on the second floor, tiny and largely taken up with luggage deposited by the guests. I arrived early but not that early at 1100am. When I asked if a room was available I was told check-in was at 2pm. I said that I knew what time the check-in was but did they have a room ready. Not negotiable. The hotel could have been empty but they weren't going to let me check in any earlier than the designated time. I supposed I should have asked the pilot of the flight to circle Hong Kong for several hours so as not to inconvenience the hotel by arriving a few hours early. So I had to dump my bags and wander the streets for several hours. I wouldn't have minded if the hotel had a decent lobby, cafe or bar but no, they have nothing of the sort so you're turfed out and onto the streets. The rooms were tiny. Bad enough if you were on your own but with two people it was like a permanent game of Twister. The bathroom is one of those perspex boxes with a semi opaque strip halfway up. It doesn't leave anything to the imagination so you had better be very familiar with the person you're staying with when it comes to performing your ablutions. TV reception was rubbish. It was like watching a ticker tape parade in a snow storm and it was almost exclusively sport. Lastly, why call a hotel the WiFi and then the wi-fi doesn't work?

The airconditioning was incredibly incredibly loud, but the windows didn't open, so without Aircon the rooms were very stuffy.

( really was built for 1 small person ). - No where to leave our 2 average size suitcase. - No where for my partner to do her make up as the mirror was behind the clothe hangers. Had no light. - We had very soft pillows so we ask for an extra 2 but they only gave 1 and said they don't have enough? - The safe was not fixed to the cupboard and could be easily be carried away. - All our towels had a few old stains on them and could feel the bleach on them when we used them. - TV had very limited channels, bad reception and especially discovery channel was very fuzzy. - The Air con was noisy and blowing dust everywhere. We told them about this problem and they sent someone to replace the filters but same thing happened. There was dust on bed sheets, table, TV, bath room and made us sick with a dry throat when we woke up every morning. -The fan in the bath room was on and spinning so loud that is was annoying. Even hard to fall asleep. - We also had to pay in full up front so they was no refunds so there was no choice but to stay. The booking was made for 6 nights but after 1 night we wanted out. - For all meals we had to walk around the block.

This hotel is at center location of Hong Kong Island. Most of attractions and shopping area can be easily reached by foot. My room number is 1702, the room size is good knowing this is in Hong Kong. This room has a double bed and its firm and clean. Bathroom is divided by glass wall and equipped with basic necessaries including shampoo and shower liquid (see my photos). Towels are clean. Housekeeping did good job. Other Amenities in this room are: slippers, high-speed wireless broadband internet access, 32-inches wall mounted LCD TV, DVD player, iPod docking with radio alarm, hairdryer, safety box, refrigerator, electric kettle, tea bags and free bottle of water daily. This hotel does not have restaurant, and you certainly no need to worry for food, there are so many food choices around the hotel including few convenient stores.. The only issue I had is the noise at night, there was constant background noise and I could not figure out the coming source since I did not turn on the air conditioning. My guess is the noise might come from the public transportations running on the street below. The sound is amplified through these narrowly sit high rise buildings at night. Tip for arriving from Hong Kong International Airport, from arriving hall, looking for Airport Express Line (\u673a\u573a\u5feb\u7ebf) sign\uff0cbuy a ticket to Hong Kong Station, which is the final stop (actually there are only three stops). You can buy single journey (100 HKD) or round trip ticket (180 HKD) which is good for 30 days. Traveling time from the airport to Hong Kong Station is about 20-25 minutes. Then change to the Hong Kong Line (dark blue line) towards the Chai Wan (\u67f4\u6e7e) direction and there are 2 choices for going to Wifi Boutique Hotel: 1. get off at Wan Chai Station (\u6e7e\u4ed4), take Exit A1, left turn onto Hennessey Rd (\u8f69\u5c3c\u8bd7\u9053)\uff0cwalking about 8 minutes until hit the Marsh Rd, then turn left, walking about 2 minutes, turn left again on Lockhart Rd , looking for number 366, which only few steps away. 2. or get off at Causeway Bay Station (\u94dc\u9523\u6e7e), take Exit C, turn left and walk on Lockhart Rd for about 7 minutes, the hotel will be on the left at #366. Personally I went to hotel by the choice 2, and went to the airport by choice 1. I think the choice 1 is easier since Hennessey Rd is the big road and Lockhart Rd is smaller. However, the hotel staff said choice 2 is shorter than choice 1.

This hotel has no breakfast or lounge facilities but it is surrounded by places to go to suit every taste. I went to Starbucks for breakfast every morning - croque monsieur, wheat toast and jam and cinnamon pastry, pretty cheap. The hotel is also a short walk from Sogo Pacific, the huge Japanese department store. The hotel is uber clean and reception staff welcoming. I arrived at 10am way before check-in time, but got a room immediately, which was hugely appreciated. The hotel is close to several MTR stations (underground) and taxis are cheap and easy to get on the street. The hotel also participates in a shuttle bus service to and from the airport, which you need to book with them in advance. I took the high speed train (buy a ticket at the airport) and it's five mins to the hotel in a cab (although none of the taxi drivers ever knew where it was, it has an entrance that is easy to miss you have to give them the full address). I had one problem in the hotel - the room door would not lock, and it was fixed immediately. I highly recommend this hotel if you want to cut costs and be central but it won't suit people who like having on site breakfast, bars, etc. I would stay there again.", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel for the price\u201d", "Author": "hauyoung", "ReviewID": "UR111523956", "Content": "The hotel is 2 long blocks 10 minutes walking distance from the MTR station, If you have a lot luggage then it might be tough.

Mini refrigerator. Drawer for your clothes. Wifi access was at a good speed. Location - Close to Wan Chi, Causeway Bay and Central. Close to many restaurants. Close to cable car. MTR is about 5-10 min walk. I recommend taking the \"ding ding\" cable cars if you are not in a hurry. It's a great way to see the city. Dislikes: Room - The bed was hard as a rock. I could hear my neighbors coming and going from their room (there are only 3 rooms on each floor). Considering that I was on the 14th floor, I could still hear traffic sounds. It was okay during the night, but it was quite loud in the morning and afternoon (I like to sleep in). I found a couple of stains on the towels. Housekeeping was okay, but I have a feeling the rooms will start looking a bit run down in a year or so. Lobby - Looks like the hotel is still in the process of remodeling. They have two elevators.

This is coming from a person who rarely feels anything. I could have been imagining things though so take this info with a grain of salt. THE UGLY: Location, location, location! The 10 minute walk to and from Causeway Bay was difficult! Especially hard to do when feet are tired and there are loads of bags to carry. I had to motivate myself every night just to make it back to the hotel. I could have dealt with a small, funky, haunted room but being relatively far from Causeway Bay was a deal breaker for me. Don\u2019t get me wrong though as Wifi Hotel is still worth a try if shopping isn\u2019t the main reason why one is in Hong Kong.

Not at all!...! Better to stay away!\u201d", "Author": "ElinorinUK", "ReviewID": "UR77218182", "Content": "Wifi, which seems to be geared towards Chinese visitors, is a relatively new hotel (still under renovations) which lacks in the housekeeping and customer service departments and is definitely NOT a boutique hotel and neither value for money - you can easily get a MUCH better hotel for the price (In fact, it will be extremely hard to get something worse...)! Wifi has a good location, free internet and good TVs (with very few English channels, though) - however, this is where the benefits end...: the tiny new rooms are already dirty (look under the beds!!!....), customer service is poor, rooms can be noisy at night, and one needs to be very cautious with the credit card handling and deposits in this hotel. During our stay, there were only another two westerners staying at the hotel - all the other guests were Asian, mainly Chinese from the mainland it seems. The other two westerners were very unhappy with the hotel due to dodgy practices they witnessed or heard about, the attitude of the staff, the lack of cleanliness and the noise. One of them has actually witnessed how the reception staff was trying to charge another visitor $50 (yes, fifty dollars...) for a basic drinking glass she has accidently broken... seeing the cheap glasses in our own room, we were amazed that the hotel would want to charge anything for these (a much lower quality than ones we saw broken at a couple of other hotels' restaurants, without anyone trying to charge anything for them...). The rooms are extremely tiny which makes it very hard to move, so, if you are staying here, be very cautious as this may happen to you too. We also heard of the hotel trying to hold some money from another visitor's deposit for some damaged towels or something similar. Now, the towels we were given were worn and quite damaged (one of them had a big hole in the middle!) - so this was very surprising to hear, too. Our credit card was also not handled appropriately - the whole process seemed a little dodgy. We were actually very concerned. Some of the staff members are also extremely young and seem to be totally clueless. Cleanliness (or lack of it...): During our stay, we noticed that the floors were not cleaned - there was some dirt in few areas which remined there for a few days until I actually cleaned these myself. Additionaly, my partner bent to pick up a pen from the floor on the first day and was shocked to discover what's underneath the bed... I felt totally disgusted when I looked - the floor was totally filthy! Seems like housekeeping just can't be bothered to clean there - despite the floors being extremely easy to clean. Another visitor had a dead cockroach under his bed...! Noise: There were many chinese visitors staying at the hotel and every single night we could hear arguments next door. There are 3 rooms to a floor, all of which are facing the lifts, so you can easily hear the lifts and the movement around them, too. The other two westeners had noisy floors, too - one of them had drunk men partying till the early morning hours with loud tv. The hotel claims to have sound proof rooms, however you may not hear much of the road but you will hear your neighbours very well! BTW, we also spoke with a lovely Chinese guest who did not like the type of guests at this hotel - she said that, despite being Chinese herself, she finds that a lot of the Chinese guests there are the midbehaved, noisy type. She was complaining of some noisy people on her floor, too, and also of smoking. Some floors are still being renovated and during our stay we often encountered dust inside the lifts. Wifi charges the same price like many other mid-range hotels in HK and Kowloon - but you will find that those other hotels are world apart from wifi... Wifi only has the tv's and the location but nothing else. Don't waste your money (and who knows, you may be one of those they try to charge for all kinds of 'incidentials', too - in which case, you visit may end up even more expensive!).
