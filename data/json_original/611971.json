They were very accommodating with regard to speaking English and it was very much appreciated. The breakfast consisted of orange juice, yoghurts, fresh bread (white and brown), eggs, cheese, cold meats and tea or coffee. It was more than adequate and was a very good way to start the day.The location of the Modena is perfect - situated just off the Ku'damm. If I ever return to Berlin, this is where I will be staying.", "Date": "May 17, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR309298991", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Paul_Ireland"}, {"Content": "Love this Pension--Return Visitor Hotel Modena is a quiet, clean and friendly pension in the heart of an artsy, fun area of Berlin. We were actually here on business-- for a trade show but the atmosphere really made it seem more like a vacation.The owners are extremely helpful and accommodating. Although the rooms are small they are adequate and well taken care of.
