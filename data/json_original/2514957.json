Some people might prefer the street side for this reason. The room was clean and charming, as was the whole hotel. At first I thought the 13 euro charge for breakfast was a lot, but not after I had far less food for more money at a nearby cafe! So, actually, if you like a nice sit-down breakfast with a lot of croissants, etc. the breakfast here is generous. It is not a buffet but rather is served to you.

After finishing the business portion of our trip, we made a point to change hotels from the normal business hotel booked by our company, booking ourselves into the Caron de Beaumarchais for a long weekend centered around the dynamic Marais district. We couldn't have been more pleased with the hotel itself, the staff, and the great location. Before arriving, we were a bit concerned there might be noise, given the location just off Rue de Rivoli and knowing that Rue Vieille-du-Temple can be very busy with pedestrians at certain times of day. But we needn't have worried. The hotel was a quiet oasis, out of the bustle. Our courtside room was small, but quite normal for Paris and not a hardship. The room was laid out with care and thoughtfulness. We found each one of the staff to be quite professional, friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable about the area. The breakfast was enormous by French standards, even by some American standards. We were treated to an assortment of breads, yogurt, eggs, fruit, preserves, juice, and coffee. The Caron de Beaumarchais is conveniently located for enjoying the Marais and the rest of Paris. There are lots of shops and cafes on the same street and throughout the Marais, more shops around the corner on Rue de Rivoli, Place des Vosges 5 to 10 minutes away by foot, and the St. Paul metro stop just a couple of blocks away. Ile St-Louis, Ile de la Cite (with Notre Dame and Sainte-Chapelle), and the Latin Quarter are also not far and can be easily reached by walking. The Picasso Museum, the Carnavalet and even the Pompidou Centre are nearby. Some of the reviews here have mentioned transportation to CDG airport for 20 euros. I think a few comments about that might be helpful. The hotel can arrange a taxi to the airport for around 60 euros, which will be a direct trip. The hotel is also able to reserve slots in a shared shuttle van (a \"Navette\" in French). If you book the shuttle, the price is 20 euros for two people, but please be aware that the shuttle might go to several hotels for pickups before proceeding on to the airport. My wife and I booked the shuttle and at one point we were quite worried about making our flight. Although we knew it would be a shared ride and we had allowed plenty of time, one of the pickups was late and we had to wait, plus the driver received a phone call for a last minute unscheduled pickup which delayed us further. In the end, the driver got us to the airport on time, but had to maneuver his way heroically through morning rush hour, dodging trash trucks and morning deliveries. I wouldn't say you need to avoid the shuttle, just make sure you allow plenty of time. Overall, we heartily recommend the Caron de Beaumarchais and we'll definitely visit there again ourselves.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel in the Marais\u201d", "Author": "GoldenBear_Husker", "ReviewID": "UR125500503", "Content": "My wife and I spent five nights at the Caron during our summer holiday. We very much enjoyed our time there and would return. First off, by American standards, the rooms are tiny. However, by Parisian standards, they are normal sized...considering the price. We had a lovely little room facing the courtyard meaning it was very quiet. Because of abnormally warm temperatures, the air conditioning in the room was true luxury. So many 3-star hotels in the area do not have A/C. As spoiled Americans, we like our rooms pretty cold and this was accomplished at the Caron. The staff at the hotel were simply wonderful. They were very helpful and attentive to all requests. They provided excellent restaurant suggestions, were very adept and helping us navigate the Metro system, and even assisted us with using their complimentary wireless internet when my laptop was not cooperating. Our room was always immaculately cleaned and the maids left plenty of towels for us as well. American travelers, another warning: many of the bathrooms have tub/showers without shower curtains. We were worried about soaking the bathroom by using the shower without a curtain and were told, \"no worries.\" Took a little getting used to, but end of the day, it was, indeed, all good. While the staff at the Caron is wonderful and the rooms lovely, the best part of the hotel is its location. The Caron is located near several Metro stops and is within easy walking distance of so many sites. We loved be so close to everything. We also loved the \"vibes\" of the neighborhood and walking the streets of the Marais. Also enjoyed the farmer's market which set up on Saturdays and Wednesday's just across the square from the Hotel. Are the better hotels in Paris? No doubt, yes.

Have visited Paris perhaps 15 times over the last 25 years and in more recent years, purely out of habit, have chosen the large homogenous business class hotels. Trouble with these hotels of course is that once you take a few steps through the door you leave behind the entire raison d'etre for your trip: the unique culture and character of this beautiful City. You may as well have walked in from the streets of Liverpool or Newcastle and it is only upon realising that the French speak better English than they do in Liverpool and Newcastle that you realise you are in fact in a foreign city. So for the complete Paris experience we set out to find a quality small family run hotel rich in character, low in cost and conveniently situated. The Caron was perfect on all counts. Very friendly and helpful staff, small but nicely decorated rooms (antique furniture, fabrics on the walls, lush curtains etc) and brilliantly situated for many of the main attractions (Seine, Bastille, Notre Dame, galleries of the Place des Vosges, antiques of the Saint Paul \"village\" etc all a few minutes walk) as well as being surrounded by shops and restaurants of every description. Check-in was the best I have ever experienced. Whereas in the larger hotels you queue for check-in, then give your name, wait till they trace your booking which always seems to take 300 or 400 computer key strokes, fill out a registration card (even though you have already given your details when you booked online), confirm how long you are staying, initial your registration card in various places to acknowledge you accept the ludicrous rates and additional charges, hand over your passport, give a credit card imprint and then faint when you hear how much extra you pay for wi-fi, at the Caron we walked in, introduced ourselves to a young woman sitting behind a small antique desk who smiled, welcomed us to the hotel and handed us our room key together with a small piece of paper on which she had written the (free of charge) wi-fi code.

However, Caron de Beaumarchais was the best Paris hotel experience I have ever had... and this was due almost entirely to the amazing service of the hotel reception staff. All of them (and especially Genvieve and Etienne) went out of their ways to help us. Sometimes we just needed directions or for our restaurant reservation to be confirmed. Othertimes, when my phone was lifted by street kids, they allowed - at no additional charge to us - phone calls back to the States to get everything squared away. The hotel is quite charming, the decor is classic French... everything is elegant and tasteful. The room we stayed in was the tiniest room I have ever stayed in. And, truth be told, at the beginning of our trip, we were a little concerned about the room size (even though I am quite familiar with small Paris hotel rooms), but by the end of the stay, we were never more grateful to have chosen this hotel. The rooms are comfortable, well cared for, quiet, and the beds are comfortable.

Positives: The staff was incredibly nice and helpful, the room was very clean and a good size for 2 people (by European standards--we stayed in a front side room, which, judging from the reviews, is definitely worth the extra money), beds comfortable, free wifi, AC, and a good sized, delicious breakfast (1 order is more than enough for 2 people). Also the location can't be beat, and the decor of the hotel was so French and charming, without being stuffy and old. Negatives: The walls were a bit thin so in the morning we definitely heard doors slamming etc as housekeeping went in to clean the rooms around us. It wasn't loud enough to wake us up but definitely loud once we were up. Also, some might be annoyed that you have to leave your room key at the desk every time you leave, but reception is 24 hours and it really wasn't an inconvenience for us.

You're given fresh orange juice, tea or coffee, a kiwi, cheese, an egg, a croissant, a pain au chocolat, a baguette, yogurt and jams. The usual cafes just give you a croissant, baguette, coffee and juice for about 11 euros. The location is really good- next to many affordable stores and cafes. It's about a 2 minute walk from the islands and 1 minute to the subway (where you can easily take the #1 line to the Arc de Triomphe, Place de la Concorde and Louvre without doing an interchange). If you don't mind walking, in about 15 minutes you can be at the Louvre (*tip*: go to the mall beneath the Louvre and buy your ticket at the automatic machines and go in the Lion entrance.

I'm a light sleeper and I could hear people in other rooms early in the morning (6am) and also coming back at night. Other than that, I had no problems with noise.

Without question, Hotel Caron de Beaumarchais is our ideal hotel in Paris. Located in the lively Marais arrondissement and only a very quick walk from the Hotel de Ville metro stop, which is the premiere metro line and is highly convenient, we find the hotel location ideal. Coming back to the hotel in the evening from dining, one is presented with the stunning Hotel de Ville, which is lit beautifully at night as well as the Isle de Saint-Louis and the iconic Notre Dame Cathedral. The BHV department store is only moments away where one can pick up anything that might have been forgotten from home. Wonderful and interesting shopping abounds in the Marais and the surrounding area. The hotel is a true gem. M. Bigeard, the owner, has meticulously and lovingly restored this structure. As an interior designer, I can attest that he uses some of the finest French textiles available. His attention to detail is meticulous. Each time we return, it is apparent that he has updated or enhanced the hotel and the rooms in some manner. The rooms are small, but every square inch has been used wisely so that we have never felt cramped. There is ample storage and hanging space in both the bedroom and bathroom- even down to the smallest detail of providing a retractable clothes line over the deeply luxurious bathtub. The beds and pillows are quite comfortable and I was amazed to see that the blankets are actually fine mohair. All of the staff at the hotel have been hand selected and there are still people at the hotel that are working since the first time that we came in 2003. Whatever request we might have had, the staff has been more than willing to help us- From making and confirming dinner reservations before and during our stay to inviting my husband to meet with a colleague in the breakfast dining area to helping us to find one of the gorgeous, fine mohair blankets that are on each bed to making suggestions for my care when I became ill on our first stay at the hotel. The breakfast at this delightful boutique hotel is wonderful. Fine tea or coffee, delicious croissants and baguettes, fruit, cheese, yogurt. Wonderful! One can either enjoy breakfast in the privacy of the room or eat in the gorgeous breakfast room downstairs. Fresh flowers are in every room and a fabulous, large bouquet is in the breakfast room along with an ever changing botanic display by the elevators. We enjoy staying on the front side of the hotel so that we can watch Parisian life outside of our French doors. I could not possibly give this charming boutique hotel a higher recommendation and can well see that M. Bigeard has used only the finest through the hotel.

Combined with the very reasonable rates (they were about $225 a night back in November 2009 when the exchange rate was far more unfavorable for American travelers) I thought it was a bargain for centrally located hotels. The rooms and furnishings (the bureau, light fixtures and carpets) are of a vintage that harkens to another time period in Paris, yet are not so frayed as to be downtrodden. The windows lookout onto a cute streetscape. The breakfasts that they provide are quite excellent--warm, buttery and flaky croissants, assortments of jams, fresh squeezed OJ, yogurt that doesnt come from a factory (they come in these cute little porcelain jars which appear to be made by local dairy farmers). The hotel itself is in the Marais--though there aren't really any sights in the area (save for the Hotel d'Ville and the Place des Vosges), it is a short walk to the Metro, which will take you anywhere in town. Notre Dame and the Ile de Paris are both very near and definitely walkable. And, of course, the Seine is right near by as well. There are several small restaurants and cafes in the vicinity of the hotel, but none of the top rated restaurants that we wanted to try. If you are considering hotels located in one of the outer arrondissements or even near the airport (they seemed to have the best deals), dont!!

We decided to be spontaneous so even after we landed at Charles De Gaulle we had no idea where we were staying. Fortunately, a friend of a friend decided that we should take a taxi from the airport to an area called hotel de ville (50 euros BTW) (FYI Hotel De Ville is also an subway/underground stop). We meet him there and we were figuring out where we wanted to stay. We weren't looking for anything too pricey but we wanted a safe trendy neighborhood and one that is in proximity to public transport. He immediately chose this hotel. Absolutely love it. Its very French, and true to it's form the rooms are quite small. I had a room on the 2nd floor with a balcony. It was a nice touch but with February weather, the balcony felt like quite a waste. Although if you are a smoker it's probably convenient to use your balcony as the entire premises is non-smoking. The amenities were lacking which at first didn't really bother me because I wasn't planning on spending much time in the hotel but I found it rather inconvenient when I needed to use the internet they didn't have those facilities present. The friendly receptionist directed me to a place down the street. Points reduced for that. The major selling point for this already chic hotel, is the area. There are lots of bars, cafe's and shops that are walking distance and being that it is off a major street (Rue de Rivoli) it is pretty easy to get to in the event you're directionally challenged even after a long day of sight seeing, shopping and hopefully club hopping. Given my spontaneous experience, I may have missed this gem if I had actually planned ahead but I would probably stay here next time I come to Paris. Would I recommend this place for a couple?

We had taken a transatlantic cruise into Lisbon and then flew to Paris for the week. We flew into Orly airport on TAP airlines and took a cab to the hotel which cost 38 euros. We arrived around 6pm and met a lovely french woman who was delightful and helpful throughout the week. She took us to our room that was located on the 4th floor, #41. We had requested a balcony and was not granted such but I was happy with the room we got. When you walk into the hotel and see the layout, at first it is very startling but after you get acclaimated, you become a part of the play they are producing from the 1700's in Paris. The walls are covered with floral materal. There is an elevator which is small but functional. We had read all of the reports about the Caron and was able to pack one suitcase each plus small carry-ons.(that was a feat in itself). The room had two extremely comfortable twin beds. I have a bad back and requested three extra pillows and they were brought immediately. Their pillows were wonderful. I am a stickler for bedding. If my sleeping quarters are uncomfortable, then the rest of the trip suffers. Everything was great. As you have heard before, the rooms are not large but ours was comfortable. There was a closet on the side of the left bed that you could hang all clothes in and then a smaller closet next to the right twin bed that did not hold as much. We only hung up what we were going to use and left the rest in the suitcases. One suitcase was in the bottom of the larger closet and the other suitcase was stowed under the desk. Our two carry-ons fit snuggly under the closets.There are two chairs and a square stool. You find out later that they make up your breakfast table and chairs. We placed each chair in the two floor to ceiling window areas when we were not using them for breakfast. Speaking of breakfast, I would return to the Caron because of the breakfast. We ordered one as directed by many before us. I also requested a pot of hot water for my cappuchino that I bring with me on trips. One breakfast is 12 euros & includes either coffee or tea and you can have both for an additional 3 euros. You also receive a soft boiled egg, cheese, delicious natural full fat dannon yogurt(with all the preservatives they put in our food in the US, it was wonderful to eat everything fresh.) The yogurt was amazing. Also included is a large glass of OJ, a croissant, a pain au chocolate(square croissant with chocolate), and a french baquette. We also received a fresh kiwi and butter and two pots of homemade raspberry and apricot(my favorite) jam and a pot of honey. To top that off you received the morning International Herald Newpaper. A vertiable feast. It fit my husband and I well. We were able to share the breakfast because we ate different things. I looked forward to having it delivered to our room when we were ready to eat. They will bring it from 7am to Noon. We utilized ours as a brunch and ate about 11am every day. It was filling and delicious. The two floor to ceiling windows would open and you could watch the people walk by and listen to the street chatter. The hotel was there to make tour arrangements, dinner reservations and anything you needed. They do not expect to be tipped and the lady who was there in the afternoon till 8:30 refused a tip at the end and said it was her pleasure to see that we had the best time in Paris. Everyone was delightful. There is no safe in the room. I had read about some problems earlier with folks who had left jewerly in there room. I simply carried less jewelry this trip and kept it in my purse. We took a cab to Charles De Gaulle airport to catch our flight home. It was morning rush hour and it cost 48 euros. Tipping for cab drivers is optional and if you do, it should only be a couple of extra euros. Tipping in restaurants is included in the price so you only leave a couple more euros if the service was outstanding. We traveled around Paris backward. We should have taken the yellow on and off tour bus the first day. We took it the last. It has 80 stops and will allow you to dicover where you want to return to later. We only bought the one day pass at 24 euros pp. We were sorry we did not get the two day later when it began to rain and we left the tour. Two day pass is 39 euros pp. We also used the Batobot which is a river taxis that you get on and off as well. That cost 12 euros pp. A very beautiful ride. We utilized one of the street buses but could never firgure out the system. We did not use the metro. The section of town that the Caron is in is situated perfectly to go anywhere. Centrally located. Make a point to go to St Louis Isle which is the island behind Notre Dame. The restaurants are tiny and intimate with great Parisian food and of course delightful shops filled with Parisian wares. It is a 7 to 10 minute walk from the hotel. Our trip to Paris was wonderful and I must say that the hotel was a huge part of it being so great.

Remember, this is a small Paris hotel. Location: On arrival I found that the hotel was not on a busy street, nor was it at the corner. Near a busy street sure, but that puts it near 2 metro stations. On the edge of the Marais, it was close to more restaurants than you can shake a stick at (why you'd ever do that I don't know, but it would get tiring very quickly). The near-by stores also offer great opportunity to exercise your signature. The river and the Isle de la Cite is only a couple of blocks away and being one of the main Metro lines, only two stops from the central RER station (walkable in 10 minutes or less), you can get anyplace quickly. side note... when you walk over to Notre Dame for the obligatiory wander and pick-pocket evasion exercise, continue around behind the church to the Holocost memorial. It is often missed by visitors but well worth it. The Hotel: I walked right past it when I first arrived, not even noticing it, as did several of the people I had meet me there. The door opens to a clean, tiny, but comfortable sitting area with a desk for the attendant. The whole place is non-smoking which is great. On arrival, I was given an upgrade to a third-floor front room. It was a little cramped, but the bed was very good (only a queen). The windows open wide. I found it comfortable and appropriately quiet. The desk in the room had to be small and my laptop took up almost all the space I had a chance to see one of the interior rooms and I am glad I had an exterior.

It was also a good test of Tripadvisor.com as it was the first time I'd based my hotel choice on the reviews on here. We stayed on the second floor - room 20 - and it was beautiful. Yes the room wasn't big but we were staying 12 days and had no problem storing all our clothes. And managed to stow the empty suitcases right out of the was behind the little writing desk. Unless you have a massive appetite you really do only need one breakfast and share it. We didn't even order extra coffee as what comes with breakfast gave us 3 cups - more than enough unless you want to spend the morning looking for a toilette!! The coffee was good strong french coffee not rather weak hotel coffee which so many places serve. We always had breakfast in the little breakfast room as I do actually like to get up and out of the room for breakfast. I was a little worried as the Hotel advertises \"Herald Tribune\" with breakfast that it catered exclusively for Americans. But if you're English don't worry there's also the option of the Guardian and Figaro available in the braekfast room. The fresh flowers in the room, the bathrobes, the lovely soaps and bath toiletries all make for a special stay. We ate mainly at Les Philosophes restauant about 2 minutes walk up the road and had lovely meals and excellent service. The hotel is a perfect base for Paris, we did use the Metro for the further flung destinations. but so much is walkable - buy a good map and get out there! A word of advice get to the big attractions early - we breakfasted at 8 and were at Notre Dame, the Eifel Tower, the Louvre, the Musee d'Orsay etc by around 9.30 and beat the worst of the queues. A perfect stay and I'd recommend it to anyone wanting a peaceful break in Paris.

We had a lovely stay. The hotel is shabby chic, quaint and charming. We stayed in room 11, a front facing room on the 1st (U.S. 2nd) floor. It did not have a balcony but did have large windows opening to the lively street. The noise did not bother me with the windows open because I am a city person who lives on a busy street at home. With the window closed, noise was not an issue for me at all. The room was small but not tiny with enough room to move around. There were no dressers, but two small closets with shelves for storing clothes. Otherwise, despite the small size and quaint appearance, the room was surprisingly packed with amenities: a reasonably sized bathroom with decent plumbing, pretty tile and plenty of hot water (no shower curtain, but then again, I didn't need to clean up the floor!), blow dryer, Roger and Gallet soap and shower gels, a mini-bar fridge that allowed room for one's own purchases, a small corner mounted TV with remote, and best of all...free WI-FI! We had the hotel breakfast delivered to our room twice. Unless you have huge appetites, one breakfast is more than enough for two people. For 12 euro, it includes a mini baguette, a pain au chocolate and a croissant, a boiled egg, yogurt, 2 jams, honey, butter, glass of fresh OJ and a choice of a small pot of coffee, tea or chocolate served on a cloth covered wicker tray. Just ask for an extra cup. However, for less money, one has literally dozens of choices of boulangeries and cafes right out the front door. The front desk staff was English speaking, but willing to let me try out my rusty French. I didn't have many requests (mostly just restaurant reservations), but anything I asked was handled promptly and in a friendly manner. Best of all is the fabulous Marais neighborhood. The hotel is just half a block off the busy Rue de Rivoli for convenience, but the half block is enough to make you feel tucked away. The charming streets were full of Parisian families, gay couples, dog walkers,school children going about their business or enjoying the many cafes, boulangeries, traiteurs, or squares. Of course there are tourists, but I was really surprised that, at least at this time of year in this area, the neighborhood is mainly French. When and if you can drag yourself away from the immediate neighborhood, you are an easy walk to many sites...less than five minutes to the Seine, less than ten to Notre Dame or the Hotel de Ville or St. Paul metro stations, less than twenty minutes to the Louvre or the Pompidou. For things further afield, give some thought to the buses as well as the metro. There are many very convenient routes right on the Rue de Rivoli and the bus shelters are very well marked with maps and lists of stops. I paid 162 euros per night for the front-facing room, and I believe the price is going up to 170 euros after April 1. Is this a little pricy for what you get? Maybe, at least at the current exchange rate, but overall I thought it was well worth the price. If you are looking for a palace hotel, or an American type Holiday Inn for the price, this may not be for you. But, if you are looking for a European style boutique hotel (there were even French guests!), with some quirkiness in a perfect location, this is the place for you. I would definitely return.", "Date": "March 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, CA", "Title": "\u201cCute hotel, unflexible check out time!\u201d", "Author": "djrobsd", "ReviewID": "UR13679640", "Content": "I'm not sure why this hotel has so many great reviews. Perhaps my experience is limited, since I only stayed one night, but here are my problems with this property. I wanted to love the CUTE decor in the room and the lobby, but I couldn't get past the fact that the room they shoved me in was directly overlooking the entrance to the hotel when I opened my room door, therefore you could hear all the people entering and leaving the hotel, and you could even listen to the front desk telephone conversations. So, if you're someone who doesn't sleep too well, DO NOT GET ROOM #1 on the first floor. This will be the cheapest room they offer, at $129 Euros per night, but it's not worth the savings, unless you are someone who sleeps like a log. In addition, the check out time for this hotel is completely unflexible. Since it's a small hotel with a limited number of rooms, they will promptly ask you to leave at noon. Granted, I shouldn't have partied until 7am the nigtht before, but this hotel is in a very exciting neighborhood with lots of great places to play. Unfortunately, when I came back from my playtime, the front desk informed me that I would need to be woken up at 1130 and be out of the room by noon so they could clean it for the next guest. OK, fine, so I shouldn't have partied all night, but I would expect a little more flexibility from the hotel, possibly letting me sleep a couple extra hours. So, anyway, I told him \"Sure, wake me up at 11:30\". So, he gave me 30 extra minutes, and called me at noon. But then, every 10 minutes he kept calling me and saying \"We really need the room, please hurry\". It really rubbed me the wrong way that I was rushed out of my room. On the other hand, they did hold my bags for me until I was ready to leave Paris. Of course, holding bags at this hotel means they will place them near the fireplace in the lobby, so there is no guarantee your bags will be safe. Fortunately, nothing happened to my bags. As for the room, it was clean, and the bed was comfortable. The decor was very traditional French decor, and I did like the cute antique feel of the hotel. The bathroom was terrible, it was no bigger then a closet, and there is no shower curtain in the bathtub, so you're going to get water all over everything in the bathroom when you shower. I'm not sure what they're thinking on this one, but I found it to be very odd. At least they did have bathrobes, and some really nice Roger & Gallet French soaps in the bathroom. The location of this hotel is ideal for those who wish to party, shop, and enjoy one of the nicest neighborhoods in Paris, with BHV, the MEGA 6 story department store only steps away from the hotel. Also, if you're gay and want to visit the gay bars, this is definately one of the best locations, as one of the busiest clubs is only a few blocks walk from the hotel. Cathedral Notre Dame is only about 8-10 blocks way from the hotel. On the other hand, if you want to get around a lot more of Paris, and use public transportation, the underground subway station is also about 8 blocks away, so you will have to walk a bit to catch the Metro. Overall, I would say this is a clean and comfortable place to lay your head at night, and the staff all speak pretty good English and will help to recommend the best restaurants and places to go around town. On the other hand, if you're looking for more space, and more amenities, and you need more flexibility in your check out time, I would recommend looking elsewhere.", "Date": "February 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cPretty if slightly overpriced\u201d", "Author": "LondonHopper", "ReviewID": "UR13672861", "Content": "Really pretty hotel, with lovely original features and excellent location for exploring the Marais.

The room was small, but roomy enough for two women with lots of stuff, and contained everything one would need. On the other hand, it's full of period furniture, big drapery, a chandelier that one of us hit every time we reached overhead to put our arms through a sweater, etc. The proprietor takes pride in the period decor, but did install a shower curtain for us immediately when we expressed concern about soaking the curtainless bathroom twice/day. There's a lovely woman at the desk most days named Genevieve who spoke with us at length about anything and everything and was warm, accommodating, fun and genuine. We decided against the hotel breakfast (12 euros) even though they serve at the most humane hours....up until 12. We did, however, order coffee twice and weren't thrilled with it. We found the coffee at the boulangerie up the street to be superior and most days went there for breakfast at an extremely reasonable price. The hotel is, in my view, in the best location in Paris...two steps off the Rue de Rivoli, easy walking to the Bastille and neighborhoods beyond, and likewise to the Louvre, Ile de la Cite, left bank, etc. We even walked back from Montmartre.

The hotel is designed to look as it did in Beaumarchais's day--very French and, to this large American, with petite furnishings. The tiny elevator was padded in a floral print and had an agreeable smell of the Roger & Gallet soap provided as amenities. The breakfast room in the basement was a delight. (Note Beaumarchais wrote the books on which \"The Barber of Seville\" and \"The Marriage of Figaro\" were based. He was also a gun runner to the American colonies during the Revolutionary War.) Our room was tiny. There were approximately two feet between one side of the bed and the wall and three feet between the other side and the wall. But there were also two small closets, and while we felt a little cramped, the accommodations were certainly adequate--possibly because the two tall windows, one of which opened onto the balcony, admitted large amounts of light. We also didn't much care for the \"no shower curtain\" but managed to make do. The day staff was particularly friendly and helpful. One of them was of tremendous help to us in making arrangements to see Giverney and recommending that we see the water lilies at The Orangerie after the trip to Giverney (hint: go to The Orangerie later in the day to avoid crowds). Despite being on the fifth floor, the street noise at night was sufficiently loud that we played an \"ocean\" sound on our computer every night as white noise. The wi-fi worked well. The breakfast for 12 euros is huge. My husband and I simply ordered an extra coffee and split the breakfast and were still turning into butterballs before I realized I simply can't have a chocolate croissant for breakfast every day. We did venture down to a boulangerie one day for quiche for breakfast, but I preferred the lovely breakfast room. Note: tea lovers--the hotel is only a block from Mariage Freres. Thanks to a hint from a fellow Tripadvisor reviewer, I asked for and received a discount since we were staying such a long time. While the Marias is all that the other reviewers said it is, my husband didn't care for the hustle and small streets.

The mini fridge was great to store our fruits, cheese and vegetables for our \"picnic\" lunches. The service was impeccable and very friendly.

The process was easy and they promptly replied to all inquiries. We requested (at time of booking) and a \"front side\" room, which looks out over the street. They have less-expensive rooms on the back side but they get less sunlight and don't offer much of a view. Our assigned room was on the 3rd floor and gave us a nice street view from the large windows which open wide. We were not able to obtain a 5th floor balcony room, although requested. (I got the vague impression that these sought-after rooms may be reserved for returning customers). The location of this hotel was absolutely perfect. We loved the Marais district ,and the hotel is a short walk to the Seine and Cathedral Notre Dame. There are many cafes, bakeries, and restaurants in the immediate area. Metro and RER stations are not far. The Marais is a lively area at night with pedestrian activity. We felt very safe. The hotel's Rue Veille du Temple is a charming one-way street but is definitely not a \"quiet side street\". One negative aspect to our stay was the street noise late at night which we could hear from our hotel room ---- frequent buzzing of motorbikes, the familiar french police siren passing by on the nearby Rue du Rivoli ( a main thoroughfare), and on the weekend occasional yelling from young partiers as they walked down the sidewalk.

I'd previously stayed at a small property on the Ile St. Louis and at a larger (maybe 30+ room) property in the 5th. Sure, the website for this hotel is super charming and alluring. I assumed it would be hard for any small hotel to live up to that without charging an arm and a leg so I leveled my expectations and ended up very pleased. I made my reservation request for a frontside room by emailing them directly using their website. They promptly wrote back with a room proposal that they had only a courtyard room available. I accepted and asked to be switched to a frontside room if one became available. Upon my arrival they said a frontside room was now available, but I must have suddenly gotten overcome with cheapness as I stuck with the courtyard room, which really wasn't that much less expensive anyhow! However I was really surprised and impressed that they'd kept all my correspondence and had a record of my original request. This is a very small hotel and very homey but in a more formal French way, not homey in the \"casual\" American way. My experience was that you need to to conform to how they do some things rather than expect them to cater to your every whim, and realize that the customer is not considered \"always right\" in many other cultures. I found the desk persons to be courteous and even helpful when I needed their assistance to make a dinner reservation. Behind the desk the guidebooks are piled up. You can just ask to see them and they'll let you take them up to your room. As others have mentioned, the lobby is not really a seating area, as the picture might imply. That's the one downside of this small property: no common gathering/sitting area if you feel in need of a space larger or more open than your room. But you can't have everything, can you! Do what the French do and go to a cafe. Yes, the courtyard room is very small (second to the smallest room I've had in Paris) and dark because the courtyard doesn't let in much light (but it is not just a light well--believe me I've seen what a light well really is). I'd pay the extra for a frontside room next time. And if I needed to open the windows I wouldn't expect it to be quiet; hardly any Parisian hotels facing the street are unless they're way out in a sleepy part of town. This hotel is in a wonderful hopping area with activity right outside the doorstep. Bathroom was clean, contemporary, typical Parisian small size, and provided Edouard et Gallet Extra Vielle bath gel when I was there (my favorite E+G scent). I enjoyed the tub for soaking after a lot of Paris walking. The continental breakfast was excellent here and by far my favorite Paris-hotel breakfast (I always check them out because I'm lazy and like to eat and have coffee before going out if it's any good). And on wintry Paris mornings when you might want to eat at your hotel before braving the chill instead of going down the street to grab something, a great hotel breakfast is a wonderful experience. The coffee was excellent by French standards. They juiced oranges for my glass upon seeing me arrive in the breakfast area. The croissants were about the best I've had in Paris, the flaky type not the spongy type, both plain and chocolate. There was plain yogurt and I think they asked if I wanted an egg boiled. The breakfast room was the typical downstairs cavelike location but it didn't feel like it. To warm the space, it was cheerily lit and had nicely soothing but not moody classical music playing. I could always find a paper to read (foreign language). I couldn't think of a better way to start the day. I am rating this hotel based on my overall experience, not on whether it's a 4-star or 5-star property. Clearly a small family hotel is not the Crillon or a Four Seasons.

We had one of the more expensive rooms on the 2nd floor facing the street with a small balcony that had a table and 2 chairs. We were able to have a drink out on the balcony and people watch. The room was furnished with antiques and had a beautiful beamed ceiling and a chandelier. The bathroom was in good shape with a full tub and shower, although the tub was quite small compared to North American standards. The only minor complaint I guess that I would have was that I found the mattress a little too soft. It wasn't so bad that I woke up with a sore back or anything. The hotel is located in one of the nicer districts in Paris, Le Marais, with many shops, cafes, restaurants and museums in the area. We had some good meals nearby and were able to walk to the Picasso Museum a few streets away. The hotel staff was very pleasant and helpful. We did not eat breadfast at the hotel, but it was about 10 Euros. The Metro is within a 10 minute walk up the Rue Rivoli and it is the Hotel de Ville station.

The hotel has 6 floors (three rooms per floor) and a period lobby. The staff covered the front desk 24 hours a day and were extremely helpful. Our French was extremely rusty (for me it was non-existant), but the staff spoke English perfectly. We needed assistance finding a gym, a massage therapist and making dinner reservations. Whenever we asked the person covering the lobby, he or she was immediately there to make the call for reservations, check availability for the masseur, gym hours and location, etc. The service we received went well beyond the typical hotel service we've received in the US or other cities in europe. Our room was on the top floor facing the front. We were told it was a small room, but the smaller space was compensated by a small balcony. When we got to our room, it was exactly as we were told - small, but exceptionally clean and a balony overlooking the Marais. Based on the the floor plans of the rooms, I'd recomment facing the front of the building if possible for more light. The top two floors have views over some of the near by buildings. The service, as mentioned before, was excellent. Whenever we left in the morning, after turning in our key at the front desk, the room would be cleaned while we were gone. Sometimes we would only be gone for about an hour in the morning and they would have cleaned the room before we came back. The room was very clean and decore fit the overall period feel of the hotel. The lobby has a wood-burning fireplace that's lit from November through March. This was a great way to feel welcome after walking, shopping or having dinner and coming in from the cold. We ordered the continental breakfast three of the five mornings we were there. For 9+ Euros it included coffee, fresh orange juice, three baked breads/rolls, assorted jams and one jar of yogurt. We added another coffee to the one continental breakfast order (3.5 euro charge for the additional coffee) and you have enough food and coffee for two people and it's brought to your room in usually less than 10 minutes. It's a great way to start your day and twice the value of any room service breakfast we've gotten in the states. When we left the hotel one morning the gentleman at the front desk walked us half the block after asking directions.

We originally had booked a luxury hotel in St. Germain for the last leg of our Paris trip, but preferred to stay here. The staff helped move things around to accomodate our group (2 rooms.) They helped with directions, reservations and phone calls. The location (Marais) just cannot be beat. Well worth the price. If you go, do try the breakfast - lovely!", "Date": "February 24, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cEngaged on the Sixth Floor\u201d", "Author": "quarryrch", "ReviewID": "UR3205399", "Content": "Absolutely incredible. I booked this hotel based on their website and the reviews on this and other websites. I corresponded with the staff at the Caron de Beaumarchais and booked the room with the best view of Notre Dame because I wanted to propose to my girlfriend from the terrace. They were very accomodating and helpful. They helped me make reservations at restaurants and provided glasses and corkscrews for the wine we brought back to the room. Oh, by the way, SHE SAID YES!!!
