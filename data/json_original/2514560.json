Checked in quickly, friendly staff greeted us. We were given a room on 2nd floor. Great size accommodation, Huge (and I mean huge) comfy bed, flat screen tv (not great picture but watchable). Decor probably in need of update, but we found everthing to be clean and comfortable. En-suite also clean, towlels on the small side but they always are! The only thing I could mention is the shower curtain, I personally hate the things and this one was looking a little grubby at the bottom. But the shower was decent power and nice and hot. Speaking of heat, I would definatly suggest turning off the heater in the room at night. After a very chilly walk across town (-10C) we were in need of some heat and decided to leave the heater on when we went to bed. We woke about an hour later in sweltering heat and had to sleep with the window open for the rest of the night just to cool us down again. Our room was situated at the back of the hotel overlooking the car-park, so we didn't have any road noise. Not sure what a room at the front would be like as it is quite a busy road. Reception staff helpful and ordered us a taxi. (To the Alexander Palace about 3 miles away, charged \u00a310). Breakfast in the morning was served between 8 and 10am on a Saturday, we arrived at 9.30am and the dining room was very busy. Quite a wait on cooked breakfast, but cereals, toast, fruit, juices and coffee were replenished quickly throughout the sitting. Overall, we found this to be a great value pit-stop hotel.

A buffet of continental style or full English breakfast was served in the morning and you just had to find a table and help yourself, there was ample food for everyone and it was very nice. The only negative things I can say about the hotel is that there was a hair in the kettle and the bathroom had mould on the grout in between the tiles and the bath looked stained, the mixer taps on the sink were not very good as they did not mix the water properly because both jets of water came out of the tap separately. There seemed to be a lot of air lock in the water pipes as there were very loud noises during the night if anyone used the toilet or turned water the water on. That TV in the room had only channels 1-5 to choose from and the reception was very poor, but I think you may be able to pay to view extra channels as there was a pay T.V button on the controls.

The corridors are very narrow, and although they are covered by carpet, you can hear your paces as if the floor is going to crack and open There was no air conditioning in the rooms, and the room had a wall to wall carpet. It was quite hot during the day \u2013August. We tried to open one of the windows but it can only open 20 centimeters not more. It was very uncomfortable knowing that there was not much clean air coming in the room. Breakfast was normal. It is a kind of self service, but with adequate variety. You get the wrong directions from them. When we came we showed the paid voucher. We were given a room. The time we were leaving the reception insisted that we give them our credit card. I said that this cannot happen because they have already got paid. They had seen the voucher upon our arrival. They insisted. Somebody took it for 10 seconds, went into the inside room and brought it back to us. When back home, 2000 euros had been drawn from the card the bank informed us and goods had been purchased online. Of course I cannot blame 100% this hotel because those days we were in another hotel that did exactly the same thing. Anyway, I would never go to this hotel again even if I was given the room for free. I would recommend it just to those who have to make a stop in the area but not for anyone who visits London for a holiday.", "Date": "September 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hatfield, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cHotel cancelled my booking as they were \"overbooked\"\u201d", "Author": "ABergeron", "ReviewID": "UR79822341", "Content": "I booked the hotel for my brother as he was coming from France for my wedding.

The hotel cancelled my booking and even worst did not show any sign of empathy and hardly apologised for the inconveniance. They thought it was acceptable to book them instead at a hotel 10 miles away and were not even ready to discuss the possibility of accomadating them. I have not seen the hotel so I can't really give it a mark! I will never book again wih confort inn as when I plan a holiday or a break, I want to be able to rely on a hotel.

We found the hotel adequate all round. We had no issues to report at all. Staff were friendly and efficient. Well done to the CEO of this hotel chain for picking up the comments on Trip Advisor. Two suggestions I'd like to make are 1. We found it difficult to find the hotel on the exit 1000A as we couldn't see the hotel sign from the road due to greenery. My TOMTOM satnav brought me to Sandringham gardens. Therefore I would suggest better signage at the gate of the Leisure park entrance. 2. Finishing breakfast at 9.00AM is fine for people staying on business but for people on a leisure break its very early. As a further note I'd just like to say the hotel is situated in Finchley and we found the multicultural mix of peoples in Finchley to be really great and refreshing in the way that they all got on with each other and we were made to feel welcome every where we went. Access to London is via the Tube. We walked to the Tube station and it took around 15-20 mins. The tube into London center took another 25 mins.

Our double room was fine - clean and comfy, with a powerful shower. Others in our group had twin rooms, which also had air con and a fridge which was a bonus. Our double bed was actually two twins pushed together, which was fine for us. It made the bed huge! Free wifi was also available. The rest of the hotel was also clean and comfy, the staff were pleasant and the bar staye dopen as long as we wanted to stay up: bonus! The prices were also very reasonable for a North London hotel - \u00a32.80 for Boddingtons & \u00a33.00 for a pint of lager. There was a McDonald's, Cafe Rouge, Nando's, cinema, bowling alley & other restaurants on the same site as the hotel, which was brilliant. The only real down side is that the hotel is over a mile away from the nearest tube station, so we got taxis there - but local cab firms were prompt, polite and good value for London. I would definitely stay here again - only 20 mins from Central London by tube, offered free parking, had a lovely breakfast and a good value bar.

Paid \u00a359 through octopus travel so most impressed once again. The bed was big and comfy although on the hottest day of the year we had to kick off the duvet as it was a bit big and bulky. Breakfast and parking were included in this price and we went to eat about 8.45am just before it was due to finish and it was still fresh and hot and tasty, although as usual toasters are sooo slow your breakfast got a little chilly waiting for it. Checking out was fine and simple once again pleasent staff and a check out of 11am was a bonus when your on a leisure break so thank you for that.

Its a standard chain hotel, clean a nd functional. Situated in Finchley North London about 7 miles from the centre, its next to a leisure park with bowling alley, cinema and a number of chain restaurants so if you're staying for one night only theres no need to go to central london. If you do need to go into the centre, the nearest tube station is East Finchley on the Northern Line. Thats about a 25 minute walk, though there is a bus which runs every 10 minutes or so (less often on sunday). Once on the tube it takes about 20 minutes to get to the west end. Breakfast was included in the internet rate I got and was full english on a buffet basis--it was ok, not great, but buffets seldom are. My only problem with the hotel was the bed which was one of the least comfy I think I've ever encountered. I could feel the springs/ ridges of the mattress and had to lay on top of the quilt to make it more comfy . In summary, Ok chain hotel and not a bad price for proximity to London.

The whole place is shabby and tired and I agree with the comments regarding the single very slow lift and the distance to walk to some rooms. On the nights I stayed there the number of vans in the car park outnumbered the cars by about ten to one which says it all in my book. Perhaps I just caught it on a bad week though. My first room smelt as though someone had chain smoked all night on the previous day and after complaining I was moved to another room. Although the air was fresher the room was tired, the bathroom grubby and the bed hard and uncomfortable.
