Knutsford T is a great little spot with really good restarants (Indian, Thai, Chineese etc) and nightlife - do not miss Knutsford T. Watch out for Taxi drivers hiking up the price to travel to honk kong island or returning, tunnel fee normally only $15-20. Some taxis like to try and overcharge -One manually added charges to the final journey fare on the meter at the end of our journey. Refuse to pay if you dont agree, ask hotel staff. The metro is easy to use, cheap. Top tip - if your visiting The Peak, take the no 15 bus outside the Star ferry terminal 4 or 5 at Central Station (Hong Kong Island).

Butterfly would have blown our budget so we opted for what we thought was a deluxe room for 3 single women - a queen and 2 singles. We got a so-called deluxe which was very small, with a rollaway bed at the end of 2 single beds. no room to swing a cat. We complained and showed our hotel.com booking sheet. Apparently it meant EITHER a queen or 2 singles. After a lot of firm protest and no movement from the hotel i asked what they could do for us. They offered us a standard triple room - but no price reduction. Frankly, the size of the standard was bigger than the deluxe, and there wre no other differences in standard. The bathroom floor was covered in dust and hair and obviously had not been mopped for a while. our request for this to be cleaned resulted in a man picking up the hair in a tissue and leaving the rest! As an apology they said they would bring us a 'fruit platter' - we were rethinking our opinion of the place until presented with 1 pear, an apple and a banana, unpeeled. Not really a platter! The rooms are very musty and on the 3rd floor we looked over concrete. All in all, it felt backpacker standard, at an inflated price. I wish we had stayed at the YMCA down by the water, for very little extra, or paid for a nicer room in a cheaper district like mongkok. Given the excellent and cheap MTR, other districts with a better standard of accommodation would have suited me better. In summary, I wouldn't recommend this place.

In that time, I have stayed at a number of very good to excellent hotels in Tsim Sha Tsui (East). These hotels have two things in common: they are expensive and they are luxurious. I had to make some last minute reservations for the second week in August for my return to Asia from a visit back home. I decided to save a few dollars by booking the Guangdong Hotel, reputed to be a \"four star hotel\" located in the heart of East Tsim Sha Tsui. Without looking at reviews, I booked, just thankful to have a place to stay while in Hong Kong and resting before heading back to Shenzhen, and then to Macau. I must say that I am a little disappointed. The hotel is three star at best, too expensive, with a small room and small bathroom but a very comfortable bed. The lobby is clean, open and effecient. The check in process was smooth and easy. I was helped to the room by a good hop who earned his tip. Opening the door, I was struck by the small room. It's big enough for one, but is a little crowded at that. The only good thing, in honesty, is the bed. It is a non-smoking room, and had wireless internet for a fee, a big Sharp TV, small business desk, small chest of drawers, a micro-closet, and very crowded bathroom. It is clean, however. This hotel appears to be an older hotel, and is likely in need of an upgrade or refurbishing. The walls are a bit thin, and a couple was fighting in the room next to me last night, keeping me awake. I could hear every word (one was American). I wish I had booked either the Nikko or Intercontinental, or Regal Kowloon for that matter, all of which I have had good experiences with before.

The rate we paid by booking online (Superior Room) was much cheaper than nearly all the hotels in TST and was cheaper than the rate I received when I inquired via email. We arrived at the hotel at 11am, having arrived at HKIA on a morning flight. We were told that check-in was at 2pm but we were able to do all the check-in paperwork and left our bags at the very helpful concierge desk and were able to do some sightseeing around TST before coming back and promptly receiving the keycard to our room. The room was decent sized. Having read reviews of various hotels in TST on TripAdvisor I was prepared for the worst, but I was satisfied. The room was clean, tidy, and very fresh. The decor and fittings seem dated though. It seemed like a decent mid-leve hotel room. I wasn't going to complain since all we were going to do in the room was sleep and rest, since we'd spend every other available hour exploring Hong Kong. We didn't eat at any of the hotel restaurants because we wanted to explore al Hong Kong had to offer. The hotel is very well situated, only a 5 minute walk from the nearest MTR entrance as well as a brisk 10-15 minute walk to Victoria Harbour, Star Ferry and various TST destinations. The tour desk was very helpful in arranging reservations for guided tours and for our airport transfer on departure the concierge was helpful as well. We were able to store our bags with them between our 12 Noon check-out time and our 3pm coach ride to the airport. It's not the most luxurious or newest hotel in TST, but it's relatively cheap and well situated. My only real complaint was that the hotel WiFi, while not free, is very expensively priced. I suggest travelers either come bringing their own 3G modem and buying a prepaid SIM or heading down the street to the pizza place that offers free WiFi. Overall, it was a decent place.

It's no Hyatt, if you know what I mean, but the lobby is quite impressive and spacious. But it ends there. The reception manager, Flo i think her name was, was quite unaccommodating unlike the other attendants, Pat and Catherine. Those two had a great attitude. Although I must complain that we got there at 1PM, and Flo said the room would be ready at 2, so we waited. At 2, they said the room wasn't ready yet. Long story short they gave us our room keys at 3PM. 3PM!!! I am not pleased but I figure, if the room is okay then I'll let it pass. IT. WAS. NOT. They put me on a smoking floor even after I told them I have asthma. We were given a room with twin beds, a dingy carpet and a moldy bathroom. It was appalling! There were molds on the ceiling area on top of the door, and the fixtures were obviously outdated. There was a contraption on the wall that was apparently a blow dryer (possibly made in the 70s). When you're in the tub you can see the seemingly unfinished construction underneath the sink, which is quite off-putting really. The carpet was hideous. More importantly, after i asked them if I could switch to a non-smoking floor, they told me they'd put me on the waiting list---and then never got back to me! The cleaning lady was polite, but not everyone working there was, so perhaps they should work on that. It was raining on our first two days, so we asked the hotel if we could borrow some umbrellas. We asked for two as there are two of us, but they said only one umbrella per room, which was inconvenient.

We were able to get rooms for about $100 while many hotels were sold out or at $140++ a night. This hotel was not half as bad as the reviews say. No, it did not \"smell of urine\" as indicated by one of the previous reviews. I thought that it was pretty clean. The lobby was large and had a few couches for waiting. We tried to check in early at noon and the rooms were not available, but the staff let us stow our luggage and go out to explore the city while we waited for the rooms to be ready. Eventually they were ready by 1pm, and we were allowed to check in early and were upgraded to an executive non-smoking room. The hotel was implementing a \"smile campaign\" and all of the staff was extremely helpful. They brought up our checked luggage to the room after we checked in. I did find the english of the registration staff a little bit difficult to understand. The hotel is located in on a busy area, about a 5 min. walk from the Tsim Sha Tsui MTR. It was initially a bit hard to find and the area has a lot of busy traffic (more so than at BP International). It is within walking distance to Nathan Road, Harbor City, Kowloon Park and also an extended walk to Avenue of the Stars and the Star Ferry. The night markets are relatively easy to access via MTR which is just a few stops away. There are a lot of restaurants nearby. The location is pretty good but you have to be someone who is ok with crossing traffic to get to the MTR. If you are using the CityBus to get to this hotel, you are dropped off on Nathan Road just south of the Tsim Sha Tsui MTR stop. We had two rooms. One was double twins and the other was a queen sized bed (corner room). The room with the queen sized bed was smaller than the one with two twins. I would suggest trying to get a room with two twins as they pushed them together anyway and it was a larger room. Room amenities included water boiling carafe, combs, shampoo, refrigerator, hotel slippers. There was a very small LCD TV awkwardly mounted on the wall. Bathroom was adequate size, but had a strange european style hair dryer on the wall and the toilets were not as new. The bathroom had a slight musty smell. We were on the 11th floor and the view was of the back of another building. If you are a tall person, you may not like staying here. I am 5 ft. 5 inches and could touch the ceiling in the bathroom if I extended my arms. The hallways also had low ceilings (I think possibly 7 ft.). I did not use either restaurant or the internet, so have no feedback on that. Overall, I would say that this is an average type of hotel. No frills, but certainly not a bad place to stay. If a view and luxuries are important to you, then this is not a place that you may want to stay, however, if you intend to be out and about most of the time, it is a good place to stay for a few nights.", "Date": "November 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong", "Title": "\u201cHotel that smells of Urine\u201d", "Author": "rg0205", "ReviewID": "UR39414553", "Content": "It was a short notice trip so I decided to book a hotel room in Guangdong Hotel for myself, my wife and her 23 year old niece. I am from Hong Kong but given that I have a small apartment shared with family members, I thought a hotel room would be more suitable and comfortable for them. So, since their stay was for 8 consecutive nights, I decided to book a room at the Guangdong Hotel because of the convenience of the location which is just in Tsim Sha Tsui. I tried the Imperial Hotel, which was first on the preferential list but they did not have rooms that could be booked for 8 consecutive nights. The Ramada Hotel didnt have consecutive nights stay either and were charging exorbitantly on weekend stays. We ended up at the Guangdong Hotel - UNFORTUNATELY. We stayed in room 711. Check in wasn't difficult. It was swift and easy but the staff weren't exactly warm and friendly. No one helped with our baggage. Then, when we went inside the lift, we all noticed the foul smell of urine. Ironically, it wasn't just ONE lift. For some reason, ALL lifts had a foul smelling odor. Our room was a twin room suite and it was small. When we got in the room, it was dusty. Clearly, the carpet hadnt been vacuumed. I thought, okay, so this is a 3 star hotel. What do you expect? but then, I noticed a blood stain on the pillow, the curtains were FILTHY and had stains all over them. The closet had NO hangers. Not even a single one. And the worse thing was, the bathroom smelled like URINE. I thought maybe just flush the toilet and the smell would go away. It didn't. I went downstairs to complain at the front desk. After flushing the toilet, the water kept running and wouldn't stop so that was a problem, too. We were on our way out, so I had them clean the room and I specifically asked for the beds to be made and for the room to be cleaned. I also asked for clothes hangers. When we returned, there werent any clothes hangers although the bathroom smelled better. The beds were made. However, the fresh scent of the bathroom only lasted for a while. I think housekeeping only sprayed the bathroom with air freshener but did not clean it. It only took at least an hour before the smell of urine was back and none of us had even used the bathroom yet. It was late and we were all tired, so we decided to let it slide and do something about it in the morning. Again, I went to the front desk to complain. We went out for the afternoon. When we arrived after dinner, we still had NO hangers. The bed linens were NOT changed, even if i had specifically requested them to change it. I noticed hair stuck under the sheets since the beddings were white. I was furious. I ran down to the reception area and complained. I said: \"We aren't staying here for just a night. It's 8 consecutive nights and youre treating us like garbage.\" A young gentlemen said he would take care of the matter and I went back to our disgusting room. Shortly after, the manager called. He extended his apologies and offered to upgrade us to an executive suite on the 13th floor - on the next day. He also offered to send us some hangers. The housekeeping staff arrived to deliver them BUT he had asked to check the closet first. So, what in the hell was that? Assurance that I wasnt lying? The upgraded room we were sent to was room 1310. It was cleaner than 711 but small. This time we had hangers BUT we didnt have any slippers. The beddings appeared to be clean. There werent any foul smelling odors. However, a few nights into our stay, my wife and I had bed bug bites on our limbs. To say the least, this hotel stay was absolutely horrid and i would never, for the life of me recommend this to anyone.

A TV is in the room with many channels with only some in English but a desk and power points are provided for use, with good lighting throughout the room. The hotel is very clean with little clutter. The bathroom was kitted out well with good complimentary gifts including a comb, slippers and a razor. The bath is quite small but the shower was very good and the bathroom was clean. The room also has a safe and a LAN internet connection with a good speed. The service was very good and all the staff were very helpful and friendly. For: - Everything worked and was in good condition - The service was excellent - Access to ADSL internet in room for small fee (GBP8 for 24 hrs) - Good location right in Tsim Sha Tsui for tourist attractions a - MTR is a minute away - We got a business paper delivered each morning even though we hadn\u2019t asked for one. - The bathroom has a heated mirror for your convenience. Against: - Those used to quite soft beds would struggle. - Even when the air condiditoning was off, cold air was being pumped into the room for circulation around the building making the room quite clean - The breakfast isn\u2019t very good (and not included in the rate) but there are a variety of other places to go, including a Delifrance on the corner of Prat Avenue and Chatham Road South.", "Date": "December 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cGreat place @ a good price\u201d", "Author": "toothytooth", "ReviewID": "UR4301189", "Content": "Was there from 20 - 24th Dec. had the normal double room. was surprised at the size wen i got in the room.

We were given a rate of $1080 HKD (about $139 US) for a room for three. By the time we arrived at the hotel, the rate had gone up to $1360. Apparently, we had booked a double room and there was a charge of $250 HKD for an additional bed. (This was not made very clear on the Orbitz website.) We were not pleased with this increase, but kept the room anyway. Six days later when we went to check out, the rate had gone up to $1610. They had double charged us for the extra bed. After about an hour of frustrating negotiations with the manager on duty, we were able to get our rate back down to $1360.

There's a Delifrance around the corner on Chatham Road which is great for breakfast and very inexpensive. Nice enough lobby if you need to sit and wait for someone. There's internet access in the business centre but you need to pay a bit for it. Short walk to Nathan Road, subway MTR, Pizza Hut, KFC, McD's. Don't pay top dollar though 'cause it's not luxury. If the Miramar price isn't much more it's a huge step up. Lastly, if you take the Airport Express train from the airport to Kowloon, the shuttle bus doesn't stop at the door.
