Then we waited at Bus Bay No. 21 -22 to catch the Bus - Park Island Route to Noah\u2019s Ark Reort. First night in HK will be spent here. Bus ride takes around 20 minutes from airport, we alighted and entered a small pass- through- complex/building (near the tall condominiums and almost facing the beach) and walked for 5 minutes to get to the park main entrance which is also the way we took to the resort. Hotel is located inside the park. If you are used to an action-packed Hongkong, you will feel a sort of isolation in this area. My teens felt that way and thought the place was boring. ROOMS: Affordable and very clean. We got an 8 bunkbed- Room (hostel) and we all loved it. It was sooo comfortable like 5 star quality. It has 2 toilets with all toiletries & towels. Also with a refrigerator, coffee kettle and 1 free bottled water & safety cabinets. Room has access to the common terrace if you need fresh air. BREAKFAST: Free and served in Harvest Restaurant (opens at 8am \u2013 9:30pm I think) facing the beach/pier (nice view) Its simple but filling \u2013 Coffee, tea, bread toasts, chicken sausage, eggs and noodles (which tastes good). Sorry no rice for that day. PARK : Good for strolling and sight seeing for small kids and senior citizens since its not as busy as Disneyland or Ocean Park especially during weekday. My teens find it too \u201cquiet\u201d with no action or rides. Half day visit is okay. Hotel guests are given a pass but NOT for the park attractions but a pass to use if you opted to go out of the hotel to shop/eat outside or stroll to the beach and nearby eateries (ask the reception for the exit at lower ground as not to pass the park main entrance anymore).. TRANSPORTATION/LOCATION: Confusing for first timers. No taxis available just bus which is 24/7. To go shopping, we take the Kwai Fong bus that takes us to Metroplaza Mall (15 minute- ride , fare- hk$10) There\u2019s a MTR/train station in Kwai Fong to further take you to Tsim Sha Tsui or Central. Ask the hotel receptionists for directions and schedules of the buses. Always bring a map. The view of the bridge and the beach gets lovelier at night. One can sip a beer in a nearby restaurant/small bar for a relaxing night. . again this is the QUIET side of HK, no shopping, no billboards, no loudness. I like this area and will def. stay here again since its nearer to Disneyland and Tung Chung-outlet shopping (by MTR) compare to hotels in Mongkok.", "Date": "June 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong, China", "Title": "\u201cRelaxing weekend stay with families :P\u201d", "Author": "Feichit", "ReviewID": "UR129445923", "Content": "Went there with 3 other GFs for a relaxing weekend stay at Ma Wan.

Our shower flooded the bathroom at first use, but hotel staff immediately dispatched a team to resolve the issue -- and it stayed resolved. There are complimentary shampoo dispensers in the shower, though the soap dispensers at the sink didn't function very well. Our only complaint was that the beds are very hard. The kids slept fine but we weren't too comfortable in our bunk beds. It'd be great if the hotel offered family rooms with a double bed for adults and bunk beds for the kids. The hotel is nicely situated on Park Island. We walked along the beach, enjoyed local food at a nearby town square, and had an easy ferry ride to Hong Kong attractions. Breakfast is served in a spacious and light-filled room looking out on the water. The noodles were great. The most inconvenient aspect of the hotel is the ill-defined route you must take to reach reception from the airport shuttle bus stop. The hotel could do better with signs explaining where to go, and perhaps have someone on hand to help with bags. We gave the resort theme park itself a skip and don't think we missed anything.

There were 9 of us so we booked two 4-bed dormitory rooms and a twin-bedded room. The kids loved the dormitory rooms with the bunk beds and the private reading lights. The rooms did look rather nice. The dormitory rooms and the normal double/twin room are on separate sides of the building, with the reception in the centre. When we were there, there was a group of school children staying in the dormitories and they were indeed noisy. Because of the visiting school kids, the restaurant was crowded, noisy, and not much food was left when we got down. The free breakfast was simple with eggs, noodles, fried rice, sausages and toast along with coffee and tea. It was hazy that day otherwise the view from the restaurant would have been magnificent. We visited the park after breakfast, and took many pictures. It is not the usual theme park setting, so it has no pool, no ride, no show. If you specially make a trip to the park and expect all these, you will be disappointed. If you don't need all those theme park features, you could do well by taking it easy, spend a few hours inside the park, then take the shuttle to the city to eat lunch, look see around, take the ferry back and stay a night on the island, you might like this hotel.", "Date": "September 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Christchurch, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cA long walk and bad water\u201d", "Author": "dcn_nz", "ReviewID": "UR118172899", "Content": "Noah's Ark in Hong Kong was selected as a last minute stop over while returning from mainland China. The cost was OK, especially given typical Hong Kong prices. However, the advice I received that I could get a taxi from the airport was incorrect. That is ONLY true between 7 am and 8 pm. Outside that time, you must take the bus, and you must have exact change! I finally found that out, finally found the bus, finally got to the bus stop ... and was not sure where to find the hotel inside the gated community within which it resides. After some searching I found a sign, and followed it ... and followed it ... and followed it. Down some stairs, along a beachside footpath, up some stairs, past a security guard I had to awake to check that I was in the right place, more walking and FINALLY an elevator and the registration desk. I was able to check in relatively easily, and got to my room. Ah! They provided free water. But wait ... it is DISTILLED water which is almost as bad for you as drinking ordinary tap water in most cities. Distilled water wants to be at equilibrium with your body so the first thing it will do is suck the nutrients and minerals from your body until it is in equilibrium. It may not be much if you have only a small amount, but if you drink distilled water regularly over a period of time, then you are basically taking your vitamins and minerals and removing them from your body. When I complained, the front desk person offered to allow me to purchase some bottled water from the vending machine. The next morning I was given a bottle from the machine, but the front desk commented that most of their customers wanted distilled water. Actually I doubt their customers thought about it. The bed was fine, but the room I had was right next door to a noisy family that stayed up quite late. The breakfast was pitiful, and what was worst was the coffee was some horrible pre-packaged stuff that tasted like instant coffee. I could not stomach it. I decided not to have the soy noodles or the sludgy scrambled eggs with \"ham\", and settled for a couple of pieces of toast. I made a hasty retreat for the airport where I was able to find good coffee at the Pacific Brewing Company. So all in all, I suppose it was worth what I paid for the room, but there are a lot of problems - access, water, breakfast, bad coffee. The beach looked nice, and there were a few other restaurants along the beachside footpath, but they had restricted hours.", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tokyo, Japan", "Title": "\u201cGreen Hotel In Hong Kong\u201d", "Author": "Greentraveller74", "ReviewID": "UR114705246", "Content": "This is the first time I have stayed in the Noah's Ark Resort as selection of Green Hotel is one of the priority for my company for our business trip.

Let's be honest here, Hong Kong hotel rooms are expensive, and we were planning a trip mainly to go to Disneyland. The hotel search said this one was close, and it was. What I didn't know was how tricky the transportation is. Noah's Ark is located on Ma Wan, which is a tiny residential island not far from the international airport and the island that Disneyland is on. However, it does not have a subway stop, so you must either take a taxi or a bus from the airport. Once you are on the island, you can take a ferry for a 20 minute ride to Hong Kong island. Also, cars are not allowed on Ma Wan, except for the public transportation and taxis, but they drop you off at one point. When we got in, it was about 1:00am, and we were dropped off at the vehicle circle. We then had to figure out how to get to the ark, which was really just a short walk from there. Apparantely they aren't used to receiving guests at these odd hours, so security had to open a gate to let us in where we eventually found a desk clerk and a waiting bed (we made sure to reserve the room for that night so one would be waiting). Our room was not one of the \"dorm style\" rooms (we were on our honeymoon...duh!) but rather a smaller room with a double bed. I was pleasantly surprised by how modern it was, with lots of nice amenities, and the shower had the absolute BEST water pressure I have ever had anywhere. Almost blew me away. Again, the room isn't large, but cosy, and very clean and modern. Well worth the price. The real charm is the island os Ma Wan itself. It's mostly a residential community made up of a series of hi-rise apartments, all bunched up together. But it has this beautiful esplanade that takes you to the ferry building. There are also a few nice restaurants along a beach that overlooks the bay and a big overhead bridge. It reminded me a lot of San Francisco only more like a village.

We wouldn't choose to stay here due to the remote location, but the hostel does have well-designed, modern and comfortable rooms. Also, sleeping inside an Ark-replica is definitely an experience you won't get anywhere else! Hotel: - This must be one of the most amazing structures we have ever stayed in. The Ark is built according to biblical proportions. It is HUGE. - As far as I could tell, all the materials used inside and out were of an impressively high quality and extremely modern. Rather than detract from what the Ark should be, it seemed to work. If you're expecting a wooden boat, you'll be disappointed. - Next to the Ark is a lovely beach with soft, fine sand and reasonably clean water. The island enjoys lower levels of pollution, in part due to their no-car policy. Rooms: - We stayed in the hostel section on the 3rd floor. I believe there is also an up-market 'hotel' section in another part of the Ark. - We had an 8-bed room. As you walk into the spacious room, there are 2 bunks to the right and 2 to the left. There are also 2 bathrooms- yay! In the middle of the room is a large long table with 8 chairs. The room opens out to the side of the Ark, which brings in lots of light and gives the kids space to run around. - I cannot say enough how well-designed the rooms are. From the storage space with combination lock at the foot of each bed, to the power shower room with a shower curtain cordoning off a dry area for your clothes.... everything has been carefully thought out and executed. There are even 8 pairs of room slippers provided. - The bathroom has 2 sinks, a separate WC room and a separate shower room. Super luxe hostel facilities. - The beds are VERY COMFORTABLE. The mattress, pillow and duvet are akin to those in a good 5-star hotel. Food: - There is a canteen-style restaurant with better than average food. - There are also many restaurants by the beach next to the Ark. Activities: - The Ark has an interesting museum and 3D and 4D shows. - There are also some outdoor activities, but I think these are organized for groups only. - If you've exhausted the attractions in the Ark, there's always the beach and the lovely Ma Wan park across the road. If I were a tourist visiting Hong Kong and minded to see the Ark, I would probably do a day-trip. But if you're after something a little different from the normal Hong Kong experience, then this is worth considering.", "Date": "April 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Neepawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201ca unique experience\u201d", "Author": "mycteacher", "ReviewID": "UR99823637", "Content": "When I first arrived at Noah's Ark resort, all I could say was \"wow!\" I stayed overnight at the resort, then checked out the park the next day.
