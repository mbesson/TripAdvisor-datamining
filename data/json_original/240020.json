We were happy with our room; it was very nice and spacious and we got a Holidome room which meant easy access to the pool. Check in was relatively fast and the staff was friendly; however, when we arrived we found out that shuttles were already booked up for the following morning, which meant we had to now pay for our transportation to the airport. This was very inconvenient, as the hotel advertises its free shuttle service; it doesn't mention , however, that there are only 6 spots on each shuttle and if you don't sign up in advance you'll be stuck taking a taxi or else you will miss your flight! In addition to this, it was a long ride up for us and we were hungry. So, we decided to eat at the restaurant right in the hotel. Bad choice! At first glance, the prices are reasonable so I was convinced we had made a good choice. However, now I wish I would not have eaten there! The service was very slow. The hostess told us it was a busy night in the restaurant (there were only about 5 tables full out of 20, so we were confused), she said a lot of the tables hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been cleaned up yet (so why weren't they cleaning them?), but she said she would still seat us. Our server was awful! He had no idea what he was doing; he brought us the wrong orders, and was not very knowledgeable. He was supposed to bring us bread and buns before our meal, but forgot to. I asked for a drink and had to remind him twice, because he kept forgetting to bring it over. I had a coupon for a free glass of wine or beer for being a Priority Club Rewards Member, and the server didn't tell me until the end that the wine I had ordered didn't count on the coupon because it had to be house wine... I don't know why he didn't tell me that when I showed him the card at the beginning of my order (that made me very mad)!! My friend got the ceaser salad and it literally smelt like stinky feet so she couldn't eat it. So all in all, we ended up paying more than we had planned, for a meal that was not all that great, and for service that was unprofessional and unfriendly. If you stay at this hotel, don't go to the restaurant!

The airline gave us a number to call for a delayed trip discount and we got a very good rate. The free shuttle arrived within 10 minutes of our call (it was posssibly already on the way as there was another customer wating). There are a number of Holiday Inns near the airport, so make sure you know which one you are going to. Check in was smooth and fast. We called reception to ask for some additional coffee and sugar and it was deliverd to our room within minutes. The room was typical Holiday Inn - large, clean and well equipped. The bathroom had a new top of the counter sink which was at odds with the holes in the tile floor and the discoloured grout. This is the only time I have encountered such a problem at a Holiday Inn, and the manager seemed quite surprised when I mentioned it at checkout. It was not serious enough for us to bother changing rooms, but it took away from the overall quality of the accommodation. The hotel features an indoor pool courtyard which could be quite noisy if your room overlooked the atrium. There were lots of children playing in the pool. The restaurant is also right there, and the whole area was noisy and smelled strongly of chlorine. Our room was well removed from the pool and very quiet although it is a long walk from reception. We booked the airport shuttle for 6:25am and it left right on time. We had asked for a wakeup call, which came on time, and we also got a followup call about 15 minutes before the shuttle left.

I'd originally booked this hotel because the pool looked really nice so we were hoping for a swim/hot tub to help us sleep before our trip....we go there and the pool was super tiny and in a pit in the middle of the Courtyard....so people eating dinner could see down into the pool area. Needless to say we didn't use it. We ate dinner at the hotel restaurant....food was ok but pricey and service was SUPER slow! But, after we had FINALLY found the place and parked our car in the long term parking which was FAR from the door and hard to get out of, we didn't want to leave again. All in all, this hotel is OK...but there are many others which are closer to the airport and are much nicer and less expensive. For being an \"Airport Hotel\", it's actually nowhere near the airport.

Our room was quite nice with a king size bed, small fridge, large bathroom, free WiFi. The room was very clean and the bed quite comfortable. We also received very good service when checking in. The location of the hotel leaves alot to be desired - there is only a bus stop in front of it, no subway station, no nearby restaurants or stores. You basically have to drive to get anywhere from the hotel. In addition, they offer a shuttle to the airport and let customers park their cars there during their trips. They don't seem to manage the number of cars in their lot so it was absolutely jam packed - we had to park completely on the other side of the hotel on Saturday night. Having so many cars parked long term also prevents them from clearing the snow from the lot. We were there in early Feb - it was an absolute mess - about 6 inches of bumpy ice everywhere! Very dangerous! The other thing to look out for is that our room was facing the atrium / pool area so it was very noisy during the day. It didn't bother us because we only got back to the room at 10:30pm at which time the pool was closed. But if you need to rest during the day, it could be an issue.

Even though we were given a floor plan and directions to our room at the check in counter we had a hard time finding it. When we eventually found it, the room was clean and comfortable with nice toiletries and we have no complaints whatsoever about it. It was also quiet and private. We ate chips from a vending machine because by then it was too late for a meal delivery and we decided we should eat a proper meal at the hotel restaurant in the morning instead as they advertised a great breakfast. We got up in the morning and went off to find the restaurant at around 11am. It was closed. We checked out of our room and asked where we could buy some food in the hotel. We were told that breakfast was over at 10.30am and that the restaurant was due to open again at noon, however, we should still be able to get a cup of coffee there. We had to literally beg the restaurant staff for coffee, as they kept insisting they were closed, but finally the manager relented and sent a waitress to fix us up with two cups of coffee. After much huffing and puffing and obviously extraordinary inconvenience to them they managed to provide us with two cups of coffee for which we were charged a total of 5 dollars. At noon, we returned to the restaurant to find it still closed. A family of four was waiting outside. The manager was abrupt and told us to come back later. We returned at 12.15 to find the family of four still patiently waiting outside the restaurant in front of the closed sign. They asked the manager if they could order room service instead of eating in the restaurant, and he snapped back that room service was not available at this time. By 12.30 the family of four had give up waiting and went off to order food for delivery. At 1.15 pm the restaurant was still closed. We also gave up and took a cab downtown. This is an airport hotel and unlike downtown Montreal, there are no restaurants within easy walking distance. Travelers are either arriving after a long flight or they are preparing for a long flight.

The fact that there was no food avaiable at noon - in the middle of the day is in our opinion diagraceful.

She explained to me that although it was an older hotel, it was currently being renovated a little at a time. She told me I could look at my room before checking in and that if I was not satisfied, I could see another room. She told me about the indoor pool and outdoor pool. She also mentioned that kids eat all meals free. Parking is also free. The purpose of our travel was simply to give our kids a fun hotel experience for one night. This hotel was the perfect choice. Every staff member was polite and friendly. Upon arrival, I asked to look at my room first and the agent willing let me look at the room. We purchase our buffet breakfast upon check-in and saved a few dollars by purchasing it at check-in. There is a huge indoor atrium with beautiful tropical gardens , a large indoor pool (with a LIFE GUARD) and our only complaint about the pool is that the water was too cold...although the kids didn't seem to mind...they also supply life jackets! The outdoor pool is also large...has a lifeguard...lawn chairs and life jackets. The pools are not open at the same time, but they have good hours. They also have a pool table, ping pong, air hockey and some video games available. Our evening meal at the restaurant was pretty good. The kids ate for free so no complaints here. The breakfast buffet was good value for the money...lots of delicious fresh fruit, muffins, croissants etc., cheese, bread several hot food items, juice, coffee and more...again, the kids ate for free. The biggest downfall of this hotel is that it just doesn't feel spotlessly clean like some other hotels do. It wasn't gross or anything, but you could tell that it needed some upkeep in places and more cleaning. The renovated areas look beautiful and once it is all done, I think it will be excellent...let's hope the price doesn't go up! I guess you could ask for a renovated room or to be in the renovated area...it looked as though the 400 hallway was the nicest...we were in the 200 hallway. You can also get rooms that look into the atrium as opposed to looking outside...this is kind of neat but the rooms lack a bit of privacy because people can walk right past your window and look in unless the curtains are closed...very well! All in all, we were extremely happy with our stay. This is an excellent hotel for a family with young kids because there is lots to do right at the hotel...the location is not appropriate if you want to walk to stores etc. because it is an airport hotel.

Second bed in my room was barely on its bed frame. -furnishings were old -A/C unit worked fine -the worst part were the HEAVY yellow water stains staring at me from the ceiling. It was disgusting and made me wonder how this hotel (or more aptly, MOTEL) can represent a Holiday Inn. i have been to many Holiday Inn's in the USA and Canada and this really took the prize of being the worst. I'm not a person that wants to complain, and have nothing bad to say about the staff. But the room is what I am concerned about and when carpets have stains, when ceilings are 30-40% covered with yellow stains, and even small things like having over priced items in your vending machines to squeeze another $1 or $2..its just sad. For a family, I can understand the whole budget and entertainment aspect. There was a pool with kids in it (indoor) and maybe that is who this might be for, a family on a budget trying to give something to their kids that they will cherish. But still, I'm sure its within budget to upgrade and come up to par with other hotels or simply take the Holiday Inn name off the front. Also, in my hallway, there was a bucket collecting rain from a leaking ceiling on the second floor. This was a very sad sight each time I walked to my car and back to my room. I would not recommend this hotel nor would repeat. And to be honest, I did not stay the 3rd night on my booking. Since I cannot get a refund, I took this as a loss and booked at another hotel down the road for my final night. I really need one good nights sleep so I can manage the 9hr drive back to my home. Think long and hard about booking here. Unless its a last resort, you might want to see what else can be had. We all want to save money, that was my intention anyway, but this stay made me realize that saving cash was nothing to be proud of when my back ached every morning. Oh, for eating, choices are limited...there is a place to eat inside the hotel, but outside, I could only find a Tim Hortons and Subway within a short driving distance. Access to Montreal core was VERY easy by car (not sure about subway access) and airport is down the road with their shuttle service.

Very spacious room with everything we needed. The lobby had an amazing pool surrounded by trees designed to look like an outdoor courtyard. The staff were courteous- we asked to extend our check out and they kindly allowed us to extend it to 230pm with no charge. We ordered room service and it came promptly and was delicious. When we ran out of coffee (we like coffee) we asked a housekeeper to bring us some more- she was extremely kind and gave us plenty more. (no charge) The pool was great but we were in it for about 20 minutes before we were told that we had to get out and it was \"booked for 3 pool parties for the rest of the day.\" That was unfortunate. Also the beautiful hot tub was broken. We used the lobby bar several times. I was a bit disappointed that at lunch time (1pm) we had to eat in the lobby because the restaurant was closed. (?). The bartender was kind though and the food not bad and fairly priced. All in all- we were only in Montreal for 24 hours and were happy with the hotel we chose to spend so much time in.

The rooms have 2 doors - 1 to a corridor and the other to the indoor pool, which meant a fairly noisy atmosphere. The rooms are tired and dated and in need of renovation. Additionally, the alarm clock was not set to the right time, which I would expect - it was 12 hours off and therefore looked as if it was the right time. Luckily I had set the alarm on my cell phone as well, or I would have missed my flight.

This review is long and detailed, as I don't want anyone else to experience what we did. I will start off by saying that I am from Montreal, but now reside in Ottawa. My girlfriend and I were flying south for a week from Montreal, so our travel agent booked us here for one night. It seemed convenient, with free parking for up to 28 days with one night stay (this is too good to be true and I should have suspected something), and an airport shuttle service. In my opinion, this hotel is a fraud. Firstly, it is not an \"airport\" hotel. It is on Cote de Liesse near the Decarie expressway, which is a long way from the airport. To be exact, it is a $20 cab ride. I know this because their \"shuttle service\" is a joke and we had to get a taxi. Where to begin...We checked in and the extremely rude receptionist demanded the confirmation number, even though you would think a name would suffice. In any event, I went out to the car and retrieved the number. I then asked for a 6 a.m shuttle to the airport, and was told that it was full and that the next available shuttle was at 7 am. As our flight was leaving at 8:30 this was a little too tight. The lady at the desk seemed very unconcerned, and told me that since the weather was bad, the next day's flights were likely going to be delayed anyhow. Apparently during her breaks she moonlights as an air traffic controller. I asked how many spots they had on their \"shuttle' and was told it is an outside service they use, and only 10 spots are available, and since this was a busy time of day for flights it was already full. Here's a clue...if it's a typically busy time, get more (or bigger) vehicles. Anyhow, I wanted to stay somewhere else but it was getting late and we just wanted to chill out, so I asked what the room rate was if we didn't leave our car there. My intention was to drive ourselves to a Park and Fly in the morning and use their shuttle. The rate I was quoted was higher than what I was already being charged. They know they have you, so they scam you into having to stay there. But the best was yet to come... We went to our \"room\"...I use this term loosely, because it was a dump. Plain and simple, a youth hostel would have been better. Old, tired and dank. I called the front desk and asked for a wake-up call at 6 am. \"No problem\". I also asked that a cab be called to attend the hotel at 6:30 and pick us up. Again, \"No problem\". Not trusting them, I set the alarm in the room (which had a battery backup in case of power failure, but no battery in it!) as well as my watch. No wakeup call ever came, and no cab was called (we called one ourselves). Everything, from the sheets to the towels to the carpets and furnishings, is unclean, worn out or both. At checkout, I complained to the typically inept clerk about the service and asked to see the manager, whose name was posted on the wall as \"on duty'. Turns out he doesn't come in until noon, so I let the counter staff feel my frustration. As with the shuttle service and the wake-up call, he didn't work well either. So, to summarize, this is not an airport hotel. You are better off staying anywhere else. There are certain features an airport hotel should have, like a shuttle, a wake-up call and relative proximity to the airport. This place has none of the above. You almost need a connecting flight to get from here to the airport! It is not a Holiday Inn, but instead an independently run franchise operated by \"Hotels Cote de Liesse\" or something like that. Holiday Inn goes to great lengths to advertise this fact, as they know something we don't (yet). If there was a \"zero star\" rating possible I would give it to this joke of a building (I refuse to refer to it as a hotel). They have a clean and professional looking lobby, with a 4 star rating on the wall (that has to be fraud right there), but this is just the hook to get you to commit. I violated my own rule and failed to ask to see the room first, and I should have checked TripAdvisor beforehand. The name \"Holiday Inn\" fooled me, but never again. Therefore, if you do stay here, you do so at your own peril. Sleeping on an airport bench would be a preferable option.", "Date": "March 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belleville", "Title": "\u201cWhat a dump!\u201d", "Author": "jubejube", "ReviewID": "UR5731529", "Content": "First impression was good: nice lobby, attractive pool area.
