After reading some of the reviews and given that we'd payed \u00a376 per night per couple for a city center hotel, we weren't expecting much. Fortunately, we were proved wrong. The reception was well presented and the receptionist booked us in quickly and spoke really good English. A bell boy lead us to our rooms, opposite each other on the 4th Floor. Again, they were decorated elegantly. There was a strong smell of cleaning fluid, but i'd prefer that to any other smell and it went after a few hours with the window open. The cleanliness of the room and the hotel, overall, was really good....and i'm quite fussy. There was quite a lot of noise when the windows were open, but you are in the middle of Rome and it was fine when shut. There is a mini bar in the room which is, actually,not too badly priced, but we brought drinks in the supermarket down the rd and got ice from the hotel bar. Beer and spirits are expensive in the restaurants, so it's worth having a few beforehand if you're making a night of it! The breakfast was good for continental breakfast and had loads of variety. The roof terrace was a nice way to start the day. You are literally 3 minutes from Termini Station and the metro so you can get around easily. The metro is really cheap too. We mostly walked our way around Rome. From the Colosseum to the Vatican. This is a whole day walk but you get to see all the major attractions and landmarks, if you plan your route. Much better than the open top buses, if you're healthy and fit to do it. Overall, I'd say this place is ideally located for a tourist break. Centrally located with clean rooms and friendly staff.

This hotel was surround by hostels and other 1 and two star hotels it's felt like I was in the ghetto all immigrants hanging around the street I thought for sure I will have my handbag ripped of me. It smelled like formaldehyde and was very dark. Another night we asked the staff to make us a reservation at a restaurant recommended by a friend from Rome he said to to me oh that this place is very expensive. Again as if he were paying for it. I'm use to service and quality this place was lacking all I would never recommend this not even to my worse enemy. It's a Dump in the ghetto. I spent my last 3 days there after returning from a 3weeks tour of Europe with my husband and daughter. It was not what I expected from a so called 4star hotel. As for breakfast there was a sign saying \" Please do not only eat the croissants\" are you kidding me it was the most disgusting low class cheap looking breakfast I've ever seen, as I noticed some reviews loved it , it was the lowest quality of food as they come my family and I spare nothing when it comes to good food. We were in Europe and eating great was important. We had a personal driver that said to us this hotel was not good at all, its close to the train, you get all the rif rafs hanging around that neighborhood very dangerous.

The free breakfasts are great and have a great selection and quality. I have read some who criticize the environs. This is flat out false.

You can get shuttle service to the airport (Fiumicino) for Euro 31 or even 25 if you look. The advice given by desk staff was always right on target.

We did have a very nice time. This hotel is very, very clean. I was surprised judging by the street outside. I was very pleasantly surprised by the inside. It is at a great location. The Termini Station is 1 block to the right and one of Italy's prized Churches, Santa Maria Maggore is 2 blocks to the left. We were very happy with the bathroom. It had a very nice American style shower (not a tub with a handle) although small. My only complaint with the bathroom was the hairdryer. Its a small box with a long vacuum cleaner hose attachment. I never did master this device. The room was good size in depth but very narrow. We had a king size bed and a little desk with a flat screen TV. Beware there is NO DRESSER! There was a closet but would only hold 2 coats. If you like to unpack, there is no place to do this. The foot of the bed gives only about 9 inches till you hit the wall on the other side. The bed was very firm-which we liked. We requested extra pillow on 2 occations and were never given them. I just wadded a couple of sweaters under the pillow given. We were on the 2nd floor and it was noisey. The street below is a major street. We just put ear plugs in and didn't care about it. The breakfast is very decent but no variety. The dining room is very pretty. I suggest to hit breakfast early. A couple days we were all in competition for cups but they were replaced within 10 minutes. The desk staff was helpful if asked, but you must approach them first. If you expect to be greeted when you walk by, you will be disappointed. Beware the hotel inside can be a maze. We often go lost getting out of the elevator... We joked that the elevator moves day to day. If you are looking for a place to eat.. Electra is across the street. I highly recommend it. We ate there 3 times during our stay. We always received excellent service and the food was TERRIFIC! My favorite was spinach ravioli with truffle cream sauce! OMG it was so memorable.

We had ordered a \"family\" room which it said on their website \"three single beds\". So the next morning, after an awful sleep, we packed our bags hoping that we'll stay in our bedroom as payed for, a month in advance. They told us that if we put our bags and suitcases in one of the rooms we stayed in the previous night, we'll send them to your room. After a whole day of sightseeing, we arrived back to the hotel and gave us the key to what would have been, our room we had payed for. Instead of this, we were given the same room as we left our suitcases - two single beds and a travel bed. We were livid, as you may imagine. A four star hotel and this type of service? Pathetic. We threatened to leave the hotel and demand for our money back. A man who worked in the reception area raised his voice and offended us for two whole hours leaving other visitors who stayed there upset on our behalf.

We chose this hotel after reading the comments on trip advisor. We booked directly with the hotel and chose a triple room. The total tarriff was very good 390 euros for three nights + b/fast. Location: This is best thing about the hotel by far!! The hotel is less than a minute walk from Roma termini, and it seems as if the whole of Rome revolves around this station. You can catch a bus/train to nearly all places. And all the tour buses also start from the station. We took a taxi from Ciampino airport to the hotel, this cost 50 euros (with the meter down). However I would strongly recommend saving some money and just taking the coach which runs between the airport and termini (every 1 hour and takes about an hour and costs 4.50 euros). CHECK IN: Now this is where some of the issues begun. The gent at the desk was very polite and gave us our room cards promtly without much hassle. He then asked us for our passports to take a photocopy. We handed our pasports to a lady on the desk. We waited for a few minutes, expecting her to take a copy and hand us back our pports. After a few minutes, I asked her whether she was finished with them or not, to which she very rudely said 'come and collect them in five minutes'. What made this women think that we'd leave an important document like a passport with a complete stranger in a new country, especially as she could have taken a copy while we were waiting. So we reluctantly left for our room without our passport. My friend then called reception and asked for the pports to be sent to our room. After a few minutes they did which was a huge relief! ROOM: ALWAYS CHECK YOUR BED SHEETS. When we arrived in our room the sheets were fresh thank God, however during our three night stay our sheets were not changed even once! When we returned to our room after a long day we found our room very clean, however the bed sheets hadn't been changed. I called reception and the man stated 'sheets; one day yes, one day no'. OK fair enough. The next night we checked again and they hadnt been changed, so we called again, this time a different gent says he cant do anything about it but speak to the boss in the morning. Upon checkout I mentioned this to the lady (yes the passport one), she said the boss wasn't here and she couldn't do anything about it neither. I find this absolutely unacceptable. The room itself was good, enough space for three of us and our luggage. BREAKFAST: Breakfast was BASIC but that didnt bother us, it was the quality of the basic breakfast which was really dissapointing! The bread felt like it had been out for days - it was so crunchy you would'nt have to toast it! The coffees dispensed by the coffee machine were the worst I had ever tasted!. The scrambled eggs looked and tasted disgusting. The only good thing was the salami and the choice of yoghurts. In summary I would say that the hotel itself is good, the room/bathroom/location are everything a first time visitor to Rome can want.

In 2001 we stayed at Diana, but it appears to have gone downhill since, and after walking by it, I was really glad I switched to the Palladium. The latter gave us a 5th floor room on the street with a mini balcony window which when opened afforded views to the left to St Maria Maggiore dome and to the right to Termini station, with vibrant street life below, with plenty of hawkers selling umbrellas and stuff. When closed, the room was completely quiet until 6.30am when you could vaguely hear chairs being moved in the breakfast room on 6th floor. Complimentary bottled water in the mini bar, in wall safe, great bathroom, and rather a large room for Europe. 2 euro per half hour internet PC. Reception staff great and very friendly. We walked everywhere from here...Collosseum, Trastavere, Via Veneto, Barbarini, Trevi, Pantheon, Navona, Fiori, Villa Borghese. If you are arriving or leaving by train this is a very handy place to stay. We arrived from Paris on overnight train, and went to Naples and back between our first 2 and last day here.

I had thoroughly researched where to stay and found The Palladium palace good value for money. We had oringinally booked the standard double room at 175 euros a night direct with the hotel, but the owner made a mistake and we ended up with one of the superior rooms which should have been 235 a night. This was not bought to light until we checked out and received the bill, but the owner kindly honoured our reservation at the lower rate. Our room was 505 and had three balconies (it is at the top floor of the accomodation level), with even one off from the bathroom. The balconies were dual aspect and on both sides of the hotel so we had marvelous views down three different streets. The windows have shutters as well as the glass doors so sound is blocked out really well. The bathroom was designed with Versace tile and had a jaccuzi bath and a lovely powerfull shower. (no showergel in with the toiletrees, which seems common place with alot of hotels nowadays). Everything was clean and the beds were huge, as was the room. The breakfast was what we expected, with most things you need and I dont think you can complain when it is included in the price. The fresh pastries were delicious and most had surpise fillings, my favourite being coconut paste. The bars were always empty but there are great bars on every street with more atmosphere. The surprise was how reasonable the mini bar was in the room , a bottle of prosecco was only 3.5 and wine 3 euros. I never normally use mini bars as they are such a rip off so it goes to show that if they are reasonably priced people might actually use them. The hotel is located in quite a touristy modern area but we were getting the train from FMC airport to Termini which is literally a stones throw away so is very convenient. Everything in Rome is walkable though from the location if you are mobile enough, and there is always something to see on the way to where you are heading. The trains run every half hour to and from the airport and only take half and hour so I def recommend this as a transfer. The hidden gem is the Church Santa Maria Maggiore along the street. Just go inside and you will see what I mean, it is stunning! The hotel recommended two restaurants, the best being Sa Tanca, a fantastic seafood and fish restaurant. I will write a review on this too. Also in the street parellel is a typical Italian restaurant Nuova Stella which is handy if like us you are arriving late and want something nearby. I would also recommend the Library which is currently number 1 in trip advisor rome restaurants. So, in general, if you want to push he boat out try room 505 otherwise, if you just want somewhere fairly central to lay your head and have a hearty breakfast before sightseeing then you cant go far wrong with The Palladium Palace.", "Date": "September 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sunny Isles Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Location and Great Breakfast\u201d", "Author": "ScatmanGL", "ReviewID": "UR19996280", "Content": "Enjoyed our stay.

I had a nightmare experience with one of the front desk attendants after asking a simple question about charges for a phone call I made. I'm not sure if the hotel attendant had difficulty communicating in English, but this does not excuse his behavior. I called the front desk to ask if I had been charged for a phone call I made because I thought I might have incorrectly dialed the access number on my calling card. The front desk attendant told me that I had been charged, but kept saying that there was a way I could get the call for free. I wasn't sure if he was trying to say that I wouldn't have to pay for the call or if he was just trying to tell me how to use the access number. He told me to come down to the front desk with the calling card so that he could explain. I brought my wallet with me so that I could pay any charges. When I got to the front desk, I explained to him what I had done. But, he kept telling me that I was being charged because I did not \"respect the process.\" I'm not sure what he meant by this. He kept asking me if I knew which country I was in. I told him I wanted to pay for the charges, but I did not like his tone and I wanted to speak to the manager. He said he was the manager. I then asked if I could speak to the owner. He said he was the owner. I knew he was lying. I told him that was fine and he should just charge my card. Rather than just swiping the card I handed him, he kept saying that he was tired of explaining things to me. I said that was fine and told him to charge me. Finally he charged me. But, after I got my receipt and walked away back towards the elevator, he followed me, saying he did not need my money. He pulled out a wad of cash from his pocket and waived it in my face and told me he had plenty of money. I asked why he had charged me if he did not need the money. He told me to come back to the register and he would give me my money back. He then pulled five euros out of the register and threw them at me, telling me I was the \"stupidest person\" he had ever met. I could not believe this was happening. Especially since there were several people in the lobby watching. Later, when I asked for his last name so that I could write it on a hotel business card, he took the card from me and threw it directly at my chest. I was wearing an open-neck dress. I was aghast. How could any hotel allow its employees to treat customers this way? The next morning I asked a different front desk attendant who the real owner was and left a letter for the actual owner.

Open the shutters, and there\u2019s a small balcony from which you can look around. The bathroom was clean and included a hairdryer. The shower was small by American standards and it had water jets, which were more like a power wash than a soothing massage. The 6th floor of the hotel is home to the restaurant, where breakfast is served each day. Breakfast included cereals, milk and juices, meats and cheeses, scrambled eggs and bacon, breads and a toaster, an assortment of yogurts, coffee and teas, and fresh pastries. One day we actually saw the pastries being delivered from the bakery. We tried the custard-filled pastries, which were delicious. One evening in our room, we could hear chairs being moved in the restaurant on the floor above, supposedly people sitting down at a table, but otherwise we heard no noise from above or from the hallway. The desk clerks spoke English and were helpful when we needed to get a cab to Vatican City. Assorted newspapers were available in the lobby. Internet access was available for a fee, at a computer in a room off the lobby. Upon check-in, a porter showed us to our room and he carried my suitcase.

We booked this hotel through lastminute.com with a package which included breakfast, but the receptionist insisted that our booking is not included with breakfasts, so my husband showed him the recipts with details,but apprently it was not good enough, that he still didn't believe it, and after checking on his own computer, he only said \" right, breakfast is included\" (no apology). 2ndly, the hotel brochure on the recption desk says all rooms has a bathtub, which is not true, room 209 doesn't have one and the towels in the bathroom smells. 3rdly, the next morning when we were having breakfast, a young lady came over, rudely grabbed my husband and said \"NO breakfast for your room!\" so we had to explain to her, she then went away to check it herself, but never came back to send an apology for her rudeness. later on this lady came over and put a egg shell bucket on our table, I don't know if she did it on purpose or not, but when she put it down, she actually banged it against the table, it was very loud, and even hit my cutlery! she walked away without saying anything.(what a suprsie~) All the things I mentioned above, I could have let it go, and stay quiet. but what happened next is just out of my limitation!!! I bought a new pair of Crocs sheos in the UK 1 week before we went to Italy, and on our 3rd day, I decided to wear another pair of shoes which I bought the day before. so I put my Crocs shoes in the new shoe box and a bag, but when I came back in the evening, it was gone. My husband and I went down and speak to another receptionist Dario, explained what happened to him, he phoned the cleaning lady and confirmed that it has been THROWN AWAY!! He gave us a piece of A4 paper to write down what has happened so that he will pass on to his manager the next morning when he comes in, but then he said we will have to email the manager ourself when we get back to the UK, just to make sure that the manager has received this piece of paper, which means we will have to follow up the compensation procedure ourself. He also mentioned that usually they will report to their insurance company and it will take at least 1 month to get the money refund to the customer. Right from the point he confirmed our shoes was thrown away like a rubbish by their cleaning lady there was not a sorry from his mouth. My husband and I took the paper upstairs, wrote down what has happened, and discussed that we should tell Dario that we felt quite uncomfortable of how this issues was handled. So after given him back the A4 paper, my husband said \" I have wrote down what has happened but also I would like to give some feedback as we felt the whole thing wasn't handled nicely. Firstly the hotel has not apologise after confirming our shoes was thrown away, and even though we understand your hotel's insruance policy works in a certain way, but taking 1 month to refund the money to international guests is a bit unreasonable, it feels like the hotel is not taking responsibilities of it, and it's our bad luck that this has happened...\" before my husband can finish Dario agitatedly interrupted \" WOW~WOW~WOW~NO!\uff2eO!NO!I didn't say it's your bad luck ( but we didn't say you said it, we just said the way the hotel handles it makes us FEEL like it), I sent my man downstairs to check, and I called the cleaning lady for you( but isn't that what you are supposed to do anyway??), you can't say that to me, that is NOT right, it is an insult! You have offended me ( what?!)\" I tried to interrupted to explain that we didn't say he said such words like \" bad luck\", but he cut off my talk again \" WAIT! listen to me, let me finish my talk (wow.. all righ..)\" he continued \" and regarding the refund policy, if you go to any other hotels in the world, you will get the same solution..\" he could be right, we might get the same solution but definitely different attitude!!! he went on and on, and after giving a lecture to us, he picked up his phone, and ignored us totally. So can't believe it!!! I just don't understand why it is so hard for the staffs in this hotel to say sorry????!!!!! When we got back to the UK, we emailed the manger, and received a reply, apologised for the lost shoes, and said he left a message to the receptionist to return our mony in cash, but they must have forgotten. He then asked us for the our bank account details so that he would transfer the refund to us, which we have emailed him with detail one month ago, but had no reply from him since then. This really is the WORST hotel experience we have had so far in our life, and don't think we would get anything worse than this!!

On the other hand, in the Esquilino there are some interesting places, and you can get to many attractions in a quarter of hour walking. Nevertheless, it must be clear that the hotel is not located right in the middle of the historical centre. Rooms and services: Let s be honest again: This is not in the Intercontinental (some of the reviews could lead you to belive it). But I must say that the room we got was completly renovated and immaculately CLEAN. It was SPACIOUS as well. And so was the bath. The breakfast buffet was good enough.

Howerver, there is one thing that lets this hotel down - there is no tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms. Although nothing is a trouble for the staff it would have been nice to be able to put the kettle on for a cuppa first thing in the morning and this would have made all the difference for me. As other reviews state the Termini area is not the best area, but we didn't feel threatened in anyway. The benefits here are that you are not going to pay way over the odds for drinks and food as we did in the Vatican area. We also had the dearest cheese toastie and coffee in the most expensive street in Rome but weren't aware of this until after the event so check things out first! We had two days sight seeing using the hop on hop off open top buses (the red ones). Tickets cost 13 euros per person and can be purchased from the Termini or on the bus if you get on at one of the sights. These run about every 10 minutes and have ear phones for commentary of the sites. I would not hesitate using this hotel again.

I am pleased to say that I could not find fault with the hotel, staff or the immediate surroundings !! Arrived around noon (which is before the normal check-in time) but we were checked in with no problems. Allocated room 504 which is on the top floor and overlooks the side street. I believe this may be one of the upgrade rooms as it had a small balcony that overlooked the street, although we didn\u2019t actually ask to be upgraded, and weren\u2019t told that we had been. Couple of lifts to take you to your floors, only big enough for 6 people, but never had to wait too long for them. Large room, with double bed, small sofa (spare bed), dressing table, satellite TV and large wardrobe. Bathroom was adequate, with toilet, bidet, sink and large massage style shower (no bath). The rooms were clean and tidy, cleaned everyday with fresh towels each day if required. Also had air conditioning, which was a godsend as the temperature outside was stifling. As stated in other reviews the area around the hotel is not the best, but it\u2019s also not the worst. I have been to a lot of capital cities where things around the hotel was considerably more salubrious. Hotel is equidistant fro the Termini Train station and the Piazza Santa Maggiore (which is a wonderful church to walk around and view the painted frescoes on the ceiling, not the Cistine Chapel, but well worth a look). 15 \u2013 20 minute walk to the Coliseum , and the same to the National Monument. To be totally honest it\u2019s not that far to a lot of the famous sights that would be on most people\u2019s tour itinerary. Be warned though that your feet will eventually give up due to the cobbled streets ! Breakfast room is on the top floor (sixth). breakfast is continental style, with fruit juices, teas, coffee, bread, meat, cereal, toasting facilities. Never had a problem with the food running out or getting a table. Totally acceptable. The ever so helpful guy behind reception recommended us a couple of restaurants. Giovanni\u2019s, which is out of the hotel, turn right and two blocks up on the right. Nice food, wine drinkable, pleasant staff and decent prices. The second (can\u2019t remember name), out of hotel, turn left and the first street over the main road on the right. Ask at reception, they seemed only too willing to help. I can understand people\u2019s qualms about the noise from the road, but what you have to take into consideration is the hotels front does face onto one of the main roads in the city, and after all, you\u2019ve got to expect some noise seeing as you are in a capital city ! Yes there is road noise but it didn\u2019t disturb us too much, and on certain occasions there is rumbling from the train station. If you\u2019re a light sleeper maybe not the place to stop.

We did go there to take the subway and catch taxis so no complaints there. It's within walking distance of the Colosseum and that was a bonus. There are a couple of decent restaurants nearby and although it's not the nicest neigborhood in the world, we never felt unsafe. Our room and bathroom were spacious with good air/con. The downside is the noise. Every bus and truck in the city must go by the hotel -- our room would literally vibrate at all hours. We were on an upper floor so the actual noise wasn't too bad but you were always conscious of the traffic. Perhaps some of the rooms on the back side of the hotel don't have this problem. We only ate breakfast at the hotel once -- very standard fare and so we chose to eat more interesting meals elsewhere. Front desk staff -- one guy was totally unfriendly and unhelpful; the other was pretty friendly but we didn't depend on him for information.

They guided us in the right direction for great local restaurants which was a bonus after a long days of walking and sightseeing. Excellent location for all forms of transport. We couldn't have picked a nicer place to stay and will definitely be going back and would recommend it to anyone. Giovanni's restaurant around the corner made our last night in Rome very special. Valentino is a bit of a comedian a small family run restaurant with a great guitarist and singer to round off the evening.

It's spotlessly clean, service is fast, friendly and helpful and the first hotel I have ever stayed in where the airconditioning worked like a Swiss watch (or Japanese, rather, these days...) The location is quite close to the railway station, a slightly seedy, but nevertheless very convenient place, while the double glazing on the windows excluded street noise completely. The area is teeming with all sorts of convenient shops, food, travel appliances, etc. and all of it a lot cheaper than in central Rome. Everything in the room worked and room service was excellent. On one occasion the cold water supply was cut off for some reason, perhaps, for temporary repairs (?) Within 20 minutes it was restored again, with plentiful apologies. Breakfast room on the terrace in the brilliant Rome sunshine, food fresh and well presented, what else would one want from a hotel? In addition, the price was very reasonable (and I have a good deal of experience in this in most parts of the world...) and again, the location of the hotel means that you are right next door to all public transport facilities including the fast train to the airport from the Termini as well as the underground central point and the various city bus tours. In the event, I hired a scooter from a rental agency on the next corner and played Dolce Vita in Rome!

The train is 10 Euros each I believe. The breakfast is a bit sparce with fruit, bread, cereal, cheese and sliced meat but no warm food. It was sufficient and clean though.

In the end it was worth the research. Hotel Palladium was a great 3 star hotel located minutes from the main train station whose staff was friendly, rooms renovated including the marble and tiled bathroom. Not only were the rooms and bathroom very clean, the lobby and passages of the hotel smelt and looked clean. Breakfast was served on the roof top terrace with plenty of goodies to start your day. Since we researched alot, I remembered several hotel names as we passed them on the street and would peak into the lobby to see if we made the right choice. Trust me when I say that after seeing what some other 3 star hotels looked like, I can say with confidence that for price and quality, the Palladium is worth your stay. P.S. the pictures of the hotel on the internet are true depictions of the hotels. What you see is what you get.

The staff (Gianfranco, Stefano, Paolo, Marcello) is always very operative, gentle, courteous and helpful. They adviced us with many details how to visit the city in a pleasant way, so we didn\u2019t walk empty around the city loosing our time. They arranged us some guided tours, reservation in different restaurants, we received information for shopping area, educative commentaries about history, religion, traditions. We had a very comfortable room (410) full-option, silent and bright, the breakfast rich and tasty.

The bathrooms are okay, if you can accept the door hitting the toilet and showering without a curtain, but you are provided the same ammenities as in a more expensive hotel. The room was very quiet despite being on the street. The staff was excellent and the service was pleasant.
