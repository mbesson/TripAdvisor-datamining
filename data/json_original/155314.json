As any budget place, there are clearly ups and downs. Considering the ups: the hotel is at the heart of Montreal. Bars, Restaurants, Pharmacies, Markets all those stuffs within easy walking distance. Berri-UQAM main subway station is close door. They have a parking fence aside the hotel for free! Staff, all of them, is gently, helpful, smiling and very friendly as they were our old buddies. On the other hand, some issues may be improved. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got the ground floor first room. It would be small for a person. Considering we were a couple, we had to struggle for space. As no space for additional luggage is available in the room, we used to go over them. Bed and pillows were old and far from being confortable. Actually I got pain in my neck the first day. I noticed the room was either dusty, despite they clean it every day. Also sound proof between rooms is quite weak. No fridge, nor safebox. One of the main points was all ground floor rooms have no their own air-conditioner. It means air-conditioner is operated by a central device that provides coolness to every room (only for ground rooms). During our stay, it was common to find it off along the night, leaving the room fuggy. When it was on, it used to be very cold. Guests can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t calibrate the device. The hotel provides free Wifi internet connection. Ask front desk for login and password. And, finally, breakfast is served in a small place every morning. It has limited options of food but I considered it enough for starting the day. All in all this is a place for budget travellers. For the price you pay, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get a simple place that is more likely a B&B than a hotel.", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria, BC", "Title": "\u201cFor the price, you can't do better\u201d", "Author": "moldey", "ReviewID": "UR118042337", "Content": "We've stayed at the Hotel Manoir des Alpes on two separate occasions. The first time was when we arrived by car and needed a place with a secure and affordable place to park. They have a fenced parking lot and parking is FREE! The second time we stayed we arrived by plane and chose this hotel for it's central location and friendly staff. It's located 1/2 a block off St. Catherine's Street near \"the Village\", it's possible to walk to most of the major shopping streets and restaurants in downtown Montreal and easily to Old Town. Only two blocks from a major metro station, you can get to almost anywhere on the island in a short time. Within a couple of blocks, there are grocers, pubs, restaurants, liquor stores, parks and shopping. In the summer, St. Catherine's is blocked off to vehicular traffic through the length of The Village. The Village is the gay section, but my wife and I found it to be a very lively place and in no way threatening. The hotel offers free wifi, air conditioning and is clean and tidy. A couple of cons about the hotel might be the small size of some of the rooms and the breakfasts can be tiresome after a few days, since the choice of food is limited to cereal and toast (bagels or bread) with a small selection of muffins. However, these are more than offset by the friendliness of the staff, the central location and the relative low cost for a place in central Montreal. While we were there in July 2011, this hotel was going through an ownership change.

Our room smelled like mildew, but looked clean. They had a continental breakfast that we had to leave there cuz it was aweful, i had a 1 slice of whole wheat bread, ( i would have had 2 but they ran out) , my cup of coffee was the prettiest cuz it was decorated with someone elses lipstick....UUUUUGGGGGG....PUKE! My husband tried to grab a bagle, if thats what you want to call it, he took one bite and put it down.....we went somewhere else to eat. There are no elevators as you all know from previous reviews so if thats going to bother you, you should request a room on the first floor. Ok, so those r my complaints, but like i said the staff are so great, friendly, nice, so willing to help with everything!

My work allows me to stay in large scale expensive hotels, however when I'm on vacation with my family I have to look for more affordable places within my budget. The first thing i will tell you is to not expect luxury, because if you are, you'll be disapointed. At this price range you have to be realistic. You will find luxurious 3 or 4 stars hotels nearby but expect to spend at least $50+ more. Instead of beeing luxurious and modern, the Manoir des Alpes gives you swiss-style deco and warmth; or as my wife says: \"cozzy and cute!\". The rooms are clean and comfortable, the staff is helpfull, the location is close to everything, what more can you ask for? Well here it is... a HUGE PARKING lot, WI-FI, all-you-can-eat breakfast all of them for FREE. This is where the Manoir des Alpes has the upper hand and why it's my place of choice. A few cons: The extra pillow wasn't firm enough so they changed it, also I had to heat the croissant to fully appreciate it (I think there's not enough butter in them) but the waffles and real maple syrop (a must!) made up for it and those Fairmount bagels are just sweet!

I have stayed at this hotel so many times, that I have lost count of the number of stays I've had here. The location is outstanding. It is in the heart of the gay village. One of the biggest problems I have is that because the price is reasonable, the rooms are clean, and the service is excellent, there tends to be a contingent of budget travelling families. (Not that there is anything wrong with that.) Some of these families tend to let the kids run wild in the halls, thus disturbing that much needed early evening disco nap that you (don't try to deny it!) and I need before going out to play for the evening. Gripe #2 in the same vein, is that you get a lot of youngish travellers who whoop it up pre and post party time. In fact, once, I don't think the party kids even made it out the door, and the jams that were going on when I left, were STILL going on when I came back at 5am. Christ in a Cab! I've stayed here 100's of times. I have never once seen a bug, and the rooms are scrubbed to spotless perfection each day. The staff is ALWAYS accommodating, friendly and polite. In fact, the owner pushed me out of a snow bank early one morning, when I was stuck! (I was in my car, goofy!) The continental breakfast is good enough if you are in a rush. I'm not a fan of hotel eats, take me someplace off the beaten track! Speaking of, there is a petit plethora of restaurants in the area (Mike's, St. Huber). Please don't disappoint me by eating at these places, when you are a just short trot away from places like Cora, Le Saloon, and Piccolo Diavolo. Ahem.

To be fair, let me first say that if you're looking for an extremely basic place to sleep for the night, want to be close to everything, are very tight on money, and don't care what type of environment you sleep in, then this might be the place for you. We (my hubby & infant daughter) wanted a place that would be in the heart of everything, near the metro, have free parking & breakfast, and have a good deal on the price. It had all of that, but I was very misled by the looks of their website, and unfortunately, some of the reviews here (then again, it could have been my perception). When we drove into the area, I thought to myself, \"Uh oh.\" I knew it was kind of a seedy area from the reviews, but it was way more so than I thought. I grew up in a city, but didn't expect the hotel to be in surroundings as such from their website. Although there were plenty of restaurants open at night nearby (St. Hubert, Mike's, etc.), the area was more of a college/20-something scene. If you've got little kids, be aware that there's a 'peep show' place right down the block. OK, I'm really not trying to make this review sound very negative, but as I was saying, I was misled by the website, which makes things look very inviting and spacious. When I walked in through the entrance, I was surprised by how cramped the place was. It smelled of cigarette smoke (one of the two owners was puffing away despite the \"thank you for not smoking\" sign less than 3 feet away from him). Their \"reservation system\" was a notebook and pen, and they gave me a photocopied slip of paper to put on our car's dashboard for identification purposes (there was no attendant from what I could see). They also billed my credit card as soon as we arrived, rather than when we checked-out. The owners were friendly, and initially gave us a room with a queen and a twin, thinking that we would put my daughter on it at some point. But the room was so dark, cramped, and cold (corner room with two windows, and an emergency door leading outside) , I initially thought we might have to find another place to spend the night. The bathroom was better than the room, but I still didn't feel comfortable having my litte one sleep somewhere where it was so cold. And it didn't help that it seemed like this was a place where some people spent the night for a \"quickie\", if you know what I mean. I asked for another room, and he said he only had one other left. It was even tinier and more cramped than the first, but at least the feel of the room was a little better, and the lighting was brighter. To give you an idea of how cramped it was, you couldn't move around in the room unless you closed the door. My daughter didn't have anywhere to crawl around. I kind of felt like we were a family that just lost all their belongings and had to resort to desperate means for a night or two. Hubby was kind of mad, told me never to trust review ratings again, and to stick with trusted budget motel names. :( Before going, when I read all the reviews about the ample breakfast selections, I thought that would at least make me feel better the following day. Not so. It was a pretty basic continental breakfast: croissants, chocolate pastry, bagels, cereal, coffee, and hot chocolate. The owner brought me a glass of orange juice, but I didn't have the heart to tell him I have acid reflux and it wasn't good for me. :) Overall, I wouldn't stay here again, nor would I recommend anyone (other than the single, budget traveler) to stay here. I just didn't like the feel of the place, even though the owners were friendly, and did assist us when we needed help with finding a late-night delivery place. They're nice, but it's just that the place isn't so nice for a young family.

It's true that Montreal has a serious pan handler problem, not just in this neighborhood, but they are considerably less aggressive than the pan handlers in San Francisco whom I did find to be truly obnoxious and aggressive. One recommendation I would make to the management. It would be great if you supplied \"Do Not Disturb\" signs that people could hang from their doorknobs. When I visit Montreal I frequently stay out all night and don't get to bed until after breakfast.

The price was even cheaper than what we had originally reserved, so we stuck with the double bed since we would not spend that much time in the room anyway. As budget travelers, we did not expect or require many amenities, although we did notice that several items we typically saw in 3-star hotels were not available here (there was no safe, no alarm clock, no fridge). As others have mentioned, there is no elevator, but we had very few bags so it was not a problem even though we stayed on the third (and top) floor.
