We stayed from the 5/312 to the 9/3/12They are used a lot for conferences and by business travellers as well as tourists so you know what to expect. We got it on a flash discount sale of 50% off no cancellation or refund. I think we would have been dissapointed if we paid full price. The interior of ths one seemed a bit tiired but it was very clean and in a very good location just adjacent to Playa Santa Barbera about 20/30 minutes walk away from the the centre which can get very boisterous at night. We paid for an upgrade to a superior room and got a very big room with a huge bathroom. Breakfast was adequate. They don't put the eggs and bacon out they cook it fresh for you so don't think there isn't any just order it. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. To get from the airport we booked the shuttle Aerocity. It was only 16 Euros for two peopple whereas a taxi would cost you about 40E. We used them to get back to the airport. You can get the tube but there are lots of steps to negotiate and I wouldn't recommend it with cases or at peak times. Madrid is very spread out and full of traffic so we used the tube a lot. Buy a three day pass for 13E and it's unlimted and included the buses. Watchout for the pickpockets on the tube and in the centre as they tried to get into my wifes bag twice.

The rooms are clean and have enough space for two persons (for an extra 10\u20ac a night you can upgrade the room but I don't see any need for it). The bathroom is gigantic (almost the same size of the room) and clean. The only problem was a not very pleasant smell coming from the sewer that invaded the room during the day. Not sure however if the hotel is to blame for that or the city sewer system is the guilty one.

And this one is no different. The hotel is on a beautiful old apartment building. The rooms are average in size of what you would expect in Madrid for that size. Everything is functional, there are several power sockets in the room, and everything works. Well. Sort of. The lifts (or \"elevators\" as you may call them if you're from over the pond) are out of inspection for years (one year, one year, two years respectively). The \"main\" lift has a character of its own. From the outside, it looks a bit like an industrial freezer (this aesthetic detail is probably the nicer thing about it). But as you are going up, or down, it makes a terrible banging noise on one of the floors on your way up every once in a while. I wonder how come the management doesn't really see (or care) about the stickers that say \"inspeccion valida hasta...\" and then a date several years past. Anyway, I made it out alive, so this is just an anecdote, perhaps by the time you get there this might be fixed ;-) Internet in the room costs about 10 EUR for 24hrs, I think. You can get an unlimited supply of 30 minute free vouchers to use at the reception only. But that is low-speed Internet, and it's not really practical. An even better option is to get a prepaid SIM card, if you have a data stick or a smartphone. There's a Phone House in walking distance. I got myself a prepaid Yoigo SIM card for 20 EUR that features 500 Mb data per month for two months before it expires (unless you recharge it). As you stay at a hotel, probably one of the best ways of really judging the service is how they react when there is a problem. And indeed, during my stay there was a major problem. A hot water pipe burst on the 4th floor, turning that whole floor into a steambath and the corridors of the hotel from the 4th floor down to the street into an adventure spa. It didn't really affect me as I was on the 6th floor - except that I had no running water since the whole system needed to be shut down. I have to say that at that time - even though the staff was clearly with many bigger problems on its hand - they were really nice and accommodating, going out of their way to make the inconvenience as small as possible, offering me to move to another (fancier) NH hotel for the same price - I didn't mind - I just stayed there and wasn't really that inconvenienced apart from the little \"swim\" across the lobby floor - something out of the ordinary. One thing to remember: when you stay at NH hotels, considering dishing out for the breakfast. It's not really cheap, but well worth it - if you're hungry. There is everything - from the healthy choices to the Mediterranean, to the sweet, to the warm - enjoy! A word of warning: it seems that Madrid now has no more free parking during week days. You will have to get a ticket from a machine and then put it behind your windshield. Immediately next to the hotel, there is a green zone (somewhat more expensive and you can only get a ticket for one hour). Opposite the hotel there is a blue zone (where you can get a ticket for two hours). This is quite annoying, because you'd have to get a ticket every two hours. If not, you'll get a fine for 30 EUR, unless you don't have a ticket at all, in which case you'll get a fine of 90 EUR. There is a parking garage close by. THis has nothing to do with the surroundings of this hotel - it's actually all over Madrid now, I hear. I'll stay there again next time I'm in Madrid, and maybe by then the lifts have been inspected and don't bang anymore ;-)", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel\u201d", "Author": "Tiramisu66", "ReviewID": "UR116022097", "Content": "Nice hotel, quite location, 15-20 walk from the centre of Madrid.

The tiles in the shower where the water touched had yellow grout, which shows that noone has scrubbed them well for a long, long time. * amenities: again, a 5 out of 10. This is supposedly a hotel for business travellers, and yet they had no iron or alarm clock in the room. From toiletries, there was shampoo, body wash and soap, but no lotion. There was a TV with a substantial number of channels, a nice-sized closet, the bathroom was large and comfortable * service: Some receptionists were nicer then others, but overall I would not give it more then a 6. Room cleaning and service were also average. The first 2 days they did not leave any new shampoo/soap for us, even though we ran out and the empty bottles were left in the shower. we had to call downstairs and ask for it, at which point we were told that we have to come and get it (instead of them bringing it up). * room comfort: rooms were very small, but comfortable. We had two separate beds, but because the room is so small, they were only about 1 inch apart (which was fine with us, but it's basically like sleeping on one big bed, they were so close).
