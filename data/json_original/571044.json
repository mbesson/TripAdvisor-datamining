Not a booring standard business hotel, but something rather unique. Personell was very friendly, but not always available as there is no real front desk. The location is a bid special. Its on a nice little dead end street, but once you leave it, you can say hi to ladies waiting in hot dresses for some cars to pick them up.", "Date": "September 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berlin, Germany", "Title": "\u201cGood Location and Building\u201d", "Author": "khuja", "ReviewID": "UR84369987", "Content": "We have staid in this hotel during the wedding celebration. Hotel is ideally located in the city center and not so far from historic area of Berlin. Disadvantage is that main street is not that clean and during the night there are ladies of a light character which gives not the best impression. Great breakfast and specious rooms. equipped with flat screen and old modish furniture. Bathrooms are freshly renovated and of bright colors. They have a underground garage inclusive to the room rate with was very comfortable. Breakfast was good but not great. In general recommended for long time stayers and not for short trips.", "Date": "October 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reykjavik, Iceland", "Title": "\u201chard to find but worth it\u201d", "Author": "Icexpatriate", "ReviewID": "UR52468946", "Content": "my German boyfriend chose this place because it looked like an atypical guesthouse in a city of massive tourist hotels, and he was right. It was a bit hard to find, located behind a rather anonymous front of modern buildings (and on a street where a few ladies of the night prowled when we drove in) but it was definitely worth it. The house itself is lovely, and our room had the highest ceilings I've ever seen. The cleanliness was a biit iffy (some dust bunnies behind a cupboard I pulled out to plug in my phone charger, and some long-unusued toiletries in the bathroom) but the overall feeling was extremely pleasant and cozy. Breakfast is served in a bright room at the top of the hotel was a proper German hotel breakfast, very carefully laid out by the proprietors who definitely seem to have a certain amount of pride in their operation. It also showed that the clientele of the place is quite mixed. There were several families with children of all ages (from about 5 to teenaged), a few couples, and some older business-type fellows. All were German though. The location's quite close to the usual tourist attractions so it's easy to go by foot if you're interested, but there's also plenty of metro options in the area. After a whole day of traffic noises and walking on the cold streets, this hotel was a great place to return to for some quiet and coziness. We had a car which we parked in their underground garage for 5 Euros a day, and they were agreeably flexible about letting us stay a few hours past our checkout for no extra charge. Overall, in spite of the few dust bunnies and the initially spooky impression when driving in at night, I would recommend this place for the small-town feeling of the place, the lovely building, the friendly and helpful staff, and the pleasant breakfast.", "Date": "January 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cVery nice\u201d", "Author": "AccidentQueen", "ReviewID": "UR5932262", "Content": "My boyfriend and I stayed at the Begaswinkel in August this year. It is a lovely hotel with lots of character and charm. Our room (which was located in the lower ground area) was a medium size and had two large windows looking out onto a walled courtyard. Because the room was on the lower ground level it was a little bit on the dark side, but not so much that it bothered us. The decor of the room was very nice and modern, with wooden floors, a large wardrobe, dresser, king-sized bed, small TV, table and chairs. The bathroom, however was tiny, and it was a squeeze to get round the shower unit to get to the toilet. If you are of a larger size you would probably have a bit of trouble getting to the toilet because of the narrow access! Nevertheless it was modern, and extremely clean. The hotel's breakfast room is on the top floor of the hotel, accessed by the central spiral staircase (there is no elevator). The breakfast room also has an outdoor terrace, where we enjoyed our breakfast in the sunshine. The food choices were large, there were plenty of pastries, toast, bread, fruit, yoghurts, and all the usual German savoury items, plus coffee and just about every variety of tea and fruit tea you could think of. The staff were very friendly, although one or two of them did not speak very good English. There was a little bit of confusion when we checked-out of the hotel, but this was handled in an efficient but relaxed manner. The hotel is just around the corner from a U-Bahn station (Kurfurstenstrasse), only 2-3 mins walk away, and is also well located for Potsdamer Strasse, one of the main roads, with lots of bars and restaurants. Overall it was a good and fairly central location for seeing the sights of Berlin. Walking back to the hotel from the U-Bahn at night we felt safe and unthreatened. I would stay here again.", "Date": "October 9, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Residenz Begaswinkel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d571044-Reviews-Hotel_Residenz_Begaswinkel-Berlin.html", "Price": "$93 - $171*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Genthiner Strasse 30a</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10785</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "571044", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/c4/36/c4360219a46f45194eae2a9a781244687large.jpg"}}
