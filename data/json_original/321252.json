Unfortunately the tide was high meaning out water taxi had to drop us off on the Grand Canal the nearest point to the hotel as it couldn't negotiate the bridges for a doorstop delivery! We had a good map and it didn't take too long to find our way. The hotel itself was clean and welcoming with a lovely dining room for breakfast in the tented annex. Breakfast was a buffet style with cereals, yoghurts, fruit, meats, cheeses, scrambles eggs and bacon and pastries. Dinner looked expensive even with the 15% discount we were given so we ate elsewhere. The room was small but adequate and had a view over the canal at the back which could be noisy first thing in the morning when the rubbish barge came by and delivery boats too. Make sure you keep the windows closed towards dusk as we did have a problem with a mosquito one night! The turning down of the beds in the evening was a nice touch. We booked two trips with viator before we left the UK, a boat tour of the Grand Canal which was very informative and a half day excursion to Murano, Burano and Torcello. This trip could have been wonderful if only we had had more than 35 minutes in each place. Burano was beautiful and I would have liked to have spent longer there. The guide gave a commentary across the Venice lagoon in about 5 different languages so it was all a bit rushed and I didn't feel I learnt much. My advice would be to take the water bus (vaporetto) and take your time. Murano was full of glass blowing factories that just wanted to sell you their glass products - give it a miss unless you really want to buy something. Everything they sell can be bought in one of the hundreds of gift shops in Venice. Best way to see Venice? Go and get lost! St Mark's Square and Rialto is almost always signposted to you can always find your way back. I would definitely return to Venice and stay in this hotel but will bring extra money for a gondola ride which could set you back 80-100 euros.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Royal Tunbridge Wells, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNo wifi\u201d", "Author": "Debbie H", "ReviewID": "UR127553800", "Content": "Good location and rooms but without free wifi, at a charge of 20 euro per day this should be included in the room rate, particularly as you can pick it up free in the lobby! :-) Breakfast is good, but no tea and coffee or water in the room but they do give free toothbrushes, and lots of toiletries, would prefer tea and coffee.

First of all, the directions they e-mailed me were USELESS! They just told me to get off at the Rialto waterbus stop! That was it!!! I thought the hotel would be really close to the stop or there would be signs. But no! And I had to ask a nice shopkeeper for directions! The front desk staff member in the afternoon when I checked in was professional but not personal. On the contrary, I saw with my own eyes how this same staff LAUGHED and BANTERED with other guests who happened to be Caucasians. I'm nice and friendly with sense of humor so too bad I didn't get to use it! The porter who took my luggage to the room had a resentful look on his face even after I tipped him! I booked a deluxe double room which I didn't find spacious or special. I requested an upgrade which I totally understand depends on availability and they put me on a high floor. But the room was not satisfactory. Yes, there's a small foyer with closet and hallway but those are WASTED spaces. The ACTUAL ROOM where the bed is is not very big. Same goes for the bathroom. And there is NO SPACE for the toiletry at all in the bathroom! The photos they show online have a double sink but there's only one small sink in my room. The white desk and chair in the room looked cheap. Nothing special about them. The hotel room walls are THIN! I could hear people talking in other rooms from the hallway and from my room! The doors bang loudly when people close them. The night staff (tall and shaved head guy) was not friendly at all. He NEVER CRACKED A SMILE. In fact, he had an ATTITUDE problem. I had to use my iPhone (which by the way you have to PAY EXTRA for wi-fi!) in the lobby because the connection in my room was lousy. And I will NEVER FORGET THE DISDAIN and DIRTY LOOK that he shot me as he walked past me (sitting in a corner chair) to go to his staff room next to me. Like my SILENT presence there interfered with his chatting with the porter! So glad I only stayed there for two nights! I should've stayed at ACQUA Palace (which I also wanted to try but chose Bonvecchiati instead. Big mistake!) instead for those two nights! I was in Venice for four nights and for the other two nights, I stayed at Pesaro Palace ON THE GRAND CANAL which I personally much prefer! The front desk staff members at Pesaro were all friendly and lovely and personal. Their location is RIGHT next to a waterbus stop! And their lovely courtyard ON THE GRAND CANAL is amazing! There are also 3-4 delicious and moderately priced (by Venice standards lol) restaurants very close to Pesaro. On the contrary, the restaurants near Bonvecchiati are VERY touristy and expensive and some not very good. I'm not the only one who's complained of their poor customer service and unfriendly staff. Check the other reviews including booking and you'll see others! I e-mailed Palace Bonvecchiati over 10 days ago saying the room was not satisfactory and the staff not friendly. And I waited for their response all this time. Nothing! They did not even acknowledge my e-mail! It speaks VOLUME about their customer service!

It's not the same hotel we've been in, last year, and we were very satisfied with this change. The Palace Bon Vecchiati was a wonderful choice, in many ways. First of all, it has been totally refurbished. Rooms are... roomy, with modern furniture and clean decoration. We got a mini-suite, with a view to the rear \"street\", which allowed us to see many gondolas passing by, many of them with singing gondolieri. If you come from Marco Polo airport by watertaxi, the hotel features a private dock, which is very convenient. But, if you prefer to come by Vaporetto, there's another nice feature: the hotel location. Palace Bonvecchiati is located at Calle dei Fabri, which runs from Rialto neighborhood to St. Mark's square. Rialto bridge is one of the famous Venice attractions, and is also one of the Vaporetto's stops. From there to the hotel it's a short, almost-straight walk, without any bridge to cross. St. Mark's Basilica, at St. Mark's square, is Venice main attraction. The hotel sits half way, from Rialto to St. Mark's square. Shopping is at hand, and so is Hard Rock Cafe. Hotel staff is very handy and nice. They provided us with all sort of information we needed, from store locations to Vaporetto schedule. The daily rate includes breakfast, with breads, cheese, cold cuts, jelly, eggs, cereal, fruits, juice and cakes. It's a small buffet, but we could allways find good choices for the meal. Everything is fresh and tasty. Buffet staff is also very nice. The hotel doesn't feature a restaurant, but we didn't feel the need, for there's plenty of good options in Venice, from pizza to five-course meals. We surely recommend Palace Bonvecchiati and we would come back. One final word: there's another hotel, very close to this, called Bonvecchiati (without PALACE).

It is honestly 5 minutes to previous, and litterally 3 minutes from the latter. And no rush at that. My fourth time in the Doge's city, but my parner's first. We wanted to make it the lavish way, but there is no way I am ever going to shell out 1.300\u00e2\u201a\u00ac in an old palace with a view, last refurbished in the 1950s to offer a decadent and derelict vision of 18th century Venice. Never. Ever. Well apparently they got the point : the Gritti just shut down for a 2-year renovation, hopefully going beyond new drape fixtures. However, besides the handiest possible location, Bonvecchiati did things well. It is not overly glamourous, but for 371\u00e2\u201a\u00ac per night inclusive of tax and breakfast, we got ourselves in their best accommodation : Deluxe Junior Suite, offering 40 sq.m of space, 3 windows in the bedroom, one of which with a view of St-Mark's Tower (when the fog eventually cleared for minutes), one large bathroom with a window, and a small dressing room, made in dazzling tones of turquoise blue. We were perfectly with that. Good bed, although on the harder side. As often happens in Europe, an alleged King actually made up of two queens stuck together. Faultlessly : the groove was hardly noticeable. Numerous bathroom amenities beyond the basic gels make up for a more luxurious touch than actually is. Breakfast is decent. Not overwhelming selection, but enough for a few days. Although the dining room is small and busy, the staff work hard to keep it fresh for the next guests, and I never noticed any waiting line. The Bonvechiati Palace has its own dock : convenient if you splurge on the motoscafo (private taxi boat) ride (120\u00e2\u201a\u00ac), as they will deliver/pick you and your luggage right inside the hotel. Only let the driver know you go to the Palace, and not another Bonvecchiati property. This will make you happy, looking in the streets at those poor folks dragging their luggage, even on wheels, from God knows where up and down flights of stairs. 120\u00e2\u201a\u00ac wisely spent, we thought. Venice is possibly the vastest tourist trap in the world. Go to St-Mark's Square for 5 minutes, and take a street away from it, any street, turn a corner, any corner, and you'll be by yourself. The crowd will be gone. Walk a little bit farther, and sink into the Venetians' Venice. This is where the charisma of this town is. Speaking of tourist trap, there seems to be a canyon between 2 kinds of food outlets. Overwhelming numbers of restaurants targeting budget tourists, with similar menus similarly and cheaply priced (can you go wrong with italian food, really ?). Very few high end (at least not after the style, but certainly after the price) trattorias offering Venetian cuisine to a mixed crowd of locals and puzzled tourist. I had never seen, anywhere in the world, even remote muslim countries, restaurants applying a 5 to 7 factor to a bottle maimstream French Champagne ; I guess there is a first time for everything. Well, at Trattoria Do Forni, and Trattoria Da Ivo, a 2-course meal for 2, with 2 glasses of Prosecco, 1/2 bottle of cheap (???) wine set us back 240\u00e2\u201a\u00ac. Wow. Food was pretty good but not even remotely great, and a fair price should have been 50% cheaper. So be prepared ...

This is a modern, fresh, minimalist hotel, in a great base location in the San Marco region of Venice. There are two 'Bonvecchiati' hotels in Venice, next door to each other: the 'standard' hotel (Bonvecchiati Hotel) and the deluxe 'Palace Bonvecchiati'. Make sure you know which you're going to, as it may mean arriving at the wrong entrance! Our water taxi dropped us, quite literally at the front door - we climbed from the boat using the hotel's handrail and took two steps and were inside! This entrance would definitely not be suitable for anyone with a physical impairment, so it would be better to be dropped off on land and walk to the street-facing entrance. The receptionist was very efficient, with the porter ready and waiting without prompting. The suite was enormous, with electronic plain key entry, and a walk-in-wardrobe, double bathroom, and large living area. Wi-fi was \u00e2\u201a\u00ac12 for 12 hours of use, that's IN TOTAL not 'as much as you like within the next 12 hour period', which was excellent value for European hotels. The bed was wonderful quality, with divine pillows. There were I believe four Italian channels, one German, one French, one Spanish, one Russian and two english on the TV, with on-demand movies. The hotel surprised us with a complimentary bottle of champagne, which was a lovely touch. The only downsides were the breakfast - the range was ok, but little things weren't in place, like the milk/hot water being empty, and some food like the breakfast cakes/pastries being left uncovered for the birds to come and land on. The service at breakfast was non-existant - I didn't get one 'good morning' from any of the waiting staff bar the maitre d' the whole time I ate there. The other slightly negative aspect was the room carpet - everything else in the room was spotless, but there were a few fairly large unpleasant-looking stains on the carpet, which was very off-putting as they were near the bed.

The hotel is perfectly located between Piazza San Marco and the Rialto bridge on one of the more major pedestrian streets, Calle dei Fabbri. First time visitors are often concerned about how to get to their hotels with luggage. We arrived on the Alilaguna water bus from the airport (this is the best way to do it, costing 13 euro per person), hoofing it across the piazza, through the clock tower's street opening, and north to the hotel in less than ten minutes. It is an even shorter walk from the Rialto where there is a large public vaporetto dock --and the #2 is fast and convenient to and from the train station. From the hotel's location, you can do anything and go anywhere. This hotel is very modern, lots of elegant marble and stainless steel in the public areas, with a friendly staff. We were immediately upgraded to a large \"executive\" room with a king bed, a comfortable single and a capacious bathroom. The breakfast is typical,with lots of options. I emailed the hotel before our arrival and was able easily to arrange restaurant recommendations and reservations; although the first dining recommendation out of the box was the same place they all recommend to tourists, a little probing got us a fish restaurant in Canareggio with only one other table of Americans -- quite remarkable. the hotel can also arrange a gondola ride right from their dock behind the hotel, but it's 130 euro, and you can negotiate a better price at one of the gondola stands (we reccommend going at about 4:30 pm when the canals are pretty quiet and the slanting sunlight makes for romantic photos).

Our area of greatest concern before arriving was how we would find the hotel in the maze of alleyways that is Venice. We took an Alilaguna Line Blu to San Marco and managed to find the hotel with little difficulty following a Google map. We could also have taken an Orange (Arancia) line to Rialto if we had arrived slightly earlier and this would have been a shorter trip. The weather during our stay was clear, but cold, but the room was a bit too warm. We asked and were advised that, in March, the heating is on, but no airconditioning. So we left some windows open at night to cool the room down. This worked but had the disadvantage in the morning that we did not need an alarm call, as the bin barges do their circuits quite early and are noisy.

The carpet in the room was very new, and the sheets and bed were very comfortable. The room had a fax machine, widescreen LCD TV, comfortable and clean furniture, and high-tech keycard entry system. CONS: pricey hotel. The network connection in my room was broken. I had a business emergency that required me to use the internet. After calling the front desk a few times, they sent the bellboy up to try to resolve the issue. They simply told me that my computer was probably 'not compatible', which was a lousy excuse. My computer has worked with every single internet connection I have ever plugged in it. It was around 11pm so I went down to the front desk. After a few minutes of complaining, the receiptionist allowed me to use the wifi free of charge for a few minutes to download my email. After I returned to the room, I tried plugging the ethernet cable in the computer again. There was a signal... that lasted 45 seconds. When I tried to sign up for hte 24 hour internet plan, the signal dissapeared and never came back again. Second complaint i have is that the narrow canal which can be seen from the room appears to also be a garbage retrieval location. Early morning, I started hearing what sounded like garbage trucks. I figured I was probably hearing things as there are no trucks in Venice. After I woke up, I discovered indeed right across from the hotel, the floor was covered with garbage bags. They cleaned everything up by noon, but it was certainly a distraction and my partner and I ended up not sleeping very well. Apart from the above two points, this hotel was defintely one of the best hotels I've stayed in in Europe. Breakfast was good and the coffee was very nice. All in all, I enjoyed this hotel because it was CLEAN and NEW, something you don't see often in Italy. If I ever go back to Venice, I would defintiely book the Palace Bonvecchiati again.", "Date": "August 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel, can't wait to go back\u201d", "Author": "Cruiky", "ReviewID": "UR38568120", "Content": "I was initially disappointed as when we arrive at 11:30pm we were told our room had been given to somebody else, but they had moved us to their sister hotel around the corner.

The hotel is very modern, swish and beautifuly furnished and decorated. Our room was massive (certainly by venetian standards!) with a large double bed, desk with fast cable internet access, small table & chairs, a walk-in wardrobe!! and nice bathroom with very powerful showed and bath. The view from the rooms 3(!!) Windows was of a canel as well and we could lean out and watch the near-constant traffic of Gondolas passing by or watch people crossing the bridge upstream while retaining plenty of privacy. Whilst on the expensive side I would definitely recommend the hotel for the incredible location first, size and quality of the rooms and moderness of the fixtures and fittings finally. If we had any complaints it would be the lack of facilities and the continental breakfast served in the hotel is pretty basic and the usual mixure of cereals, cakes, cold meats and fruit juices. The hotel does not have a restaurent but the sister hotel just round the corner does, but even better the third best rated hotel in Venice, the A La Valiglia is right opposite the hotel (see my review of this). So thanks to the location of the Bonvechiatti Palace we had a fantastic stay in Venice, within easy reach of the major sights, Vaporetto stops and right next to on of the top restaurants in Venice which we ate out in!

We were lucky with the weather, no crowds and the perfect hotel. The Palace Bonvecchiatti is easy to locate about a 100m from the \"Rialto\" vaperetto stop (Do not get off at the Rialto mercato). Once you exit, the vaperetto at \"Rialto\", do not turn left or right (our mistake) just go straight into the alley that is ahead of you. The alley is very narrow less than 3 feet (less than 1 meter) wide. It's easy to miss. Once in the alley, look up and you will see 2 signs: San Marco (on the left wall) and calle Bembo (on the right wall). Walk straight about 100 meters and the hotel will be on your right hand side (yellow bldg with green shutters). You don't have to worry about bridges and steps if you follow my directions. The hotel staff was courteous and spoke english well. We were shown to our room (165) and that was a big disappointment. We checked in at 4:00pm and apparently it was too late so we were given a handicap room. I was unhappy because we weren't told. I made my way back to the front desk and when I asked for our room to be changed the lady that checked us in suddenly lost her perfect english. She had the stupidest look on her face and didn't know what to say. The manager came out and tried to accomodate us and couldn't do anything for the 1st night but promised to change our room on the next day. They did. They moved us to room 352. It was a very nice room, very clean, spacious, no view and like everyone else says (they can use a shower curtain in the bathroom). I will not fault them for it because most european hotels are like that. Contrary to some opinions, we thought the breakfast was good. Reading some of the reviews, I imagined a bkfst room with no windows and 2 or 3 tables. This was a large room (remember you are in venice). It had 24 tables of 2. It seats 48. Not bad for a hotel that has 70 rooms. The hotel was full and we never had a problem finding a table. We had bkfst at 8:30am and lingered til 9:15am. Everyone that came in, was shown to a table. It got busier past 9:00am. They replenished the food constantly. I am sure they would stop replenishing, the closer you got to 10:30am. The foof buffet consisted of: cereals, milk and yogurt, variety of cheeses and cold cuts, scrambled eggs, sausage and bacon, 4 or 5 different cakes, pastries (croissants, chocolate croissants, danishes...), fresh fruits and fruit salad, and bread. Their selection of bread is very very limited but then again this is Italy and they are not known for their breads. The hotel is in the perfect location. You can wander for hours and return to it in a few minutes. I would highly recommend the vaporetto pass (36, 48 or 72 hours..) You can wander and not worry about going to far. When in doubt make your way back to the canal and catch the vaperetto back. We had dinner and lunch at the Cafe Sareceno (at the foot of the Rialto Bridge). It was very good. Thank you to the reviewers that recommended the restaurant. Last but not least, if you like a good coffee, we would recommend the \"cafe da dogge\". From the hotel, make a left and walk straight down to the first large street (about 1 mn walk). Turn right walk over the Ponte del Lovo and it's the 1st door to your right. (It's a 2 mn walk from the hotel). If you like figs, do try their figs and chocolate chip cake. Hope you'll enjoy Venice as much as we did. We will definetely return to the Place Bonvecchiatti. I must add that their handicap room was very well equipped for a person in a wheelchair. It had room to move around and the bathroom was very spacious.

We got of the Vaporetto at Rialto bridge and found the hotel, they kindly had emailed us directions, otherwise we may have got lost, and it does take a bit of time to get used to the layout of Venice. Our room that we had bookeed was a \"Deluxe\" room which was very good we got a good rate of \u00c2\u00a388 per night, we did not have a view of the water from our room but this was not a problem. Our room was large and modern and stylish. We had Breakfast included in our price, which to be honest the food was not up to much, which was served in very small room, that had too many tables so you were sitting so close to the people beside you, it was like you were on the same table!.... As the room was so small it was not half big enough for all the hotel guests, you are lucky if you are seated straight away, and then you feel you cant enjoy a nice leisurely breakfast. Also you order your tea and coffee before you are seated and then you are sat for ages before it arrives, also the chances of getting a second lot are Zero, and the same for getting your plates cleared away. We experienced this each time we went down for breakfast. Staff in the breakfast room did nothing over and above to provide a good service, and this was the same at the front desk, some of the staff gave the impression that our basic requets were to much for them......One afternoon we arrived back to the room, and ran a bath to find our Bath towels were missing, i phoned down to the Front desk to get some brought up to our room, however the person on the other end of the phone was insistant that the Towels were there and infact they were not, she was almost argueing with me on the phone, before even checking with house-keeping, when in fact we had used the towels the day before and did not want them changed, so we hung them back up, as they did not require to be changed, however they were missing on our return. Overall we had a good stay, i would have marked the hotel a 5/5 and not the 4/5 if the general service had not let it down, we did not come across one member of staff that we felt was providing a good level of service, so that is why i have scored it down. Would i return to this hotel Yes i would, would i return to Venice NO......I have been to many city destinations and traveled alot in Italy, and in my experience, i found Venice overrated and VERY expensive, we were lucky to get a good deal on our flights and hotel, but Eating and Drinking were very expensive indeed. Even the lower-mid end resturants were pricey. We knew before that it was going to cost alot once we were there but it cost more than that i would say double what we expected ! One recomendation was a Bar that just up from the hotel on the left, you cant miss it is the only bar in this street, and we enjoyed a night-cap or two here after our meals.

This was part of a whirlwind trip through some of the most popular stops in Europe. This is also where I had my birthday. What we liked... SERVICE: The service at this hotel is absolutely marvellous. Christian and Alissa helped my partner arrange for a wonderful birthday experience for us. The hotel is on a small canal, so they arranged for a gondolier to pick us up and take us on a gondola ride that ended at our restaurant, Bar Centrale. The hotel helped ensure that we got one of two tables on the beautiful dock of the restaurant, right on a small canal. Further, when we came back that night Christian checked to see how we liked our gondola and dinner. We also asked him about the Vaporetto to the S. Lucia train station for the next morning as we were heading out early. We realized later that our train was twenty minutes later than we thought. That morning though, moving a bit slower since we had extra time, Christian (still working) called us to make sure we were up because he wanted to be sure we got onto the Vaporetto on time. That he remembered and wanted to check up on us was fantastic (especially after a long night at work!). It takes a lot to get a 5 out of me (both my partner and I can be picky), but this was truly 5-star service! ROOM SIZE: This was the most American hotel we stayed at in terms of the size of their standard room. Very nicely appointed with a huge walk-in closet and plenty of room to move around. LOCATION: Lovely for people who want to be in the center of it all. It's about a 4 minute walk to St. Mark's Square and 5 minutes to the Rialto bridge. It's also on a small canal, so that will help if you are arriving in style in a viciously expensive water taxi (which we did not do). LOOK & FEEL: This is a very modern, fresh hotel. Everything felt new, both the rooms and the public spaces. This is not a traditional Venetian-style hotel, but it is a very modern take on the rich colors and textures of other more traditional luxury hotels. What could have been better (these are all minor)... ROOM DECOR: Very minor...this was nicely appointed, but some of the colors didn't quite go. Some of the reds and other colors in the rooms were off. Not at all a huge deal, but we were trying to come up with something. BREAKFAST TIME: Since we were out early (out the door at 7am on the 11th), it would have been nice if the breakfast service started at 6:30. There are a number of trains that leave S Lucia station early, so it would be nice to have had that breakfast available. OVERALL... We highly recommend this hotel. Our \"what could have been better\" category is pretty small stuff compared to the pluses for this hotel. Great for travelers looking for luxury and not afraid of spending some $$ for a good experience. Keep in mind though that Venice is the Paris of Italy--very expensive.

We had a room on the 3rd floor with a canal view, and although you had to look down to see the canal what was nice was that each afternoon about 5pm (when we had gone back to our room to rest) the gondolier trips went past the hotel serenading their guests and it sounded lovely, no mistaking that you were in Venice. If I were being very picky I probably wouldn't bother asking for a canal view, but certainly a deluxe room. Our room was a deluxe room and it was brilliant - large, a separate dressing room, fantastic bathroom with shower over the bath and a separate shower cubicle. We booked the wellness centre one afternoon and had the private use of the jacuzzi and sauna (great after hard day's walking). Massage was also available. We felt like film stars and had this feeling right from the start of our trip when we transferred from the airport to Venice by private motor boat - expensive but worth it. Breakfast was very good, lots of choice, hot and cold food. Management left us a lovely decorated tin of biscuits in our room one day, and orchids in the bathroom the next day.

Compared to the more \"elegant\" hotels on the Grand Canal, we got a very good deal. We ended up liking the hotel very much even though it is not \"Italian elegance\" like some others we saw. The location is most convenient on a small canal halfway between the Plaza San Marco and the Rialto Bridge, two of the most important landmarks in Venice. A private water taxi can drop you right at the hotel door on the small canal, or about four blocks away on the grand canal from which you can easily walk (if you know the way.) Lots of great restaurants and good shopping were right outside our door. The hotel is not of the grand old elegant Italian style. It's more New York style, maybe a little like a W. The lobby is contemporary, the bar is small and modern. Our room was a good-sized room done in the latest look of NYC or Chicago. Our bath was small but very updated. We had a window that opened out over the canal and we could watch the gondolas go by and even hear the gondoliers who sang. But we also could hear the trash and laundry boats that came by at 6:30 in the morning. Continental breakfast came with the room and was a nice, large buffet in a small dining room off the lobby. It was always crowded, but we never had to wait for a table. They made me a great latte (a double espresso with warm milk mixed together was my request). Our package offered a lot of extras, but we used very few. The most valuable was the water taxi to the airport as those are very expensive. We also used the massages, which turned out to be half an hour and just average. But included. We did not use the glass factory tour or the casino entry voucher and something else I've forgotten. But the rate was still good. The front desk personnel were great, got us reservations in wonderful restaurants, found us a terrific local guide for a private tour, drew maps for us, pointed out where to shop, and on and on.

Before our visit, we had wondered about upgrading, but didn't and didn't regret it. Breakfast was fine, although breakfast room quite small, so not intimate - tables close together, but we didn't mind. Great location, close to Rialto bridge and St Mark's Square. We took water taxi from airport to Rialto bridge - cost 90 euros, but only took around 25 minutes. Gondola ride (45 mins) one evening cost 100 euros, but worth it. Few tips: buy a street map before you go to help navigate to hotel. Mark on map best shops, cafes etc you find, as it's difficult to locate them again at a later date - so many little alleyways can get confusing. Weather in October very variable so go prepared. We had cloud, rain and sunshine and a major flood at high tide one day. Take lots of money - 2 chocolatey coffees + 1 cake in St Mark's Sq cost 30 euros, although much cheaper elsewhere. Visit Burano island - very quaint and colourful. We liked it better than Murano. Peggy Guggenheim modern art gallery worth a visit - made a change from all the Madonna and bambino paintings and crucifixions so prevalent everywhere else.

I booked a 'Standard Room' through Expedia but was still impressed with the quality of the room. Not the largest in the world, but perfectly adequate with a lovely Black Marble 'Bath'room (No Bath, but Great twin head Power Shower, Toilet, Wash Basin and Bidet). It had a huge firm but comfy bed, with leather headboard a 26 inch LCD TV and keyboard and mouse should you want to access the High Speed internet via the TV (additional Charge). The room was equipped with Air Conditioning, but this is turned off during the winter, so you might need to turn your room heating off if it is too hot (we did). The whole hotel was stylishly decorated in modern materials such as Marble, Glass, Wood and Leather - Not great if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for the traditional Venetian style, but for me much better than the frills and fuss! Breakfast was great - I have seen some bad reviews of Breakfast, but with no disrespect they seem to be from Americans who are used to lots of choice - For us humble Brits it seems quite a feast! They offer you Tea and/or Coffee, have 4 different fresh juices and still and Sparkling Water. Hot food consisted of Scrambled Egg, Bacon - Italian style wafer thin of course - different to you usual slice of Back Bacon, but actually really nice and pieces of nice and meaty Italian Sausage. Apart from that there were cold meats and cheese, croissants, pain au chocolate and 5-6 different cakes/pastries. Also, cereals, fruit (whole and segments) figs and Italian Sweet Biscuits. Location-wise you couldn't really want much more you're only a 3-5 minute walk from either Rialto Bridge or St Marks Square, though nothing is very far in Venice and once you get your Vaperreto pass (water buses) it doesn't take too long to get anywhere. We used both the Gym and Spa in the, the later requiring to be booked in half hour slots, but we got booked in at Reception without any trouble. One point of caution is that the Sauna and Steam room are not left turned on and you may find they are not on when you get there - Not great when you only have a half hour slot. We ended up going in the Jacuzzi first so the others had time to heat up. Not unusually for this class of Hotel, there are no Tea or Coffee Making facilities in the room, but there are plenty of places a short walk away where you can easliy find a cup. The rooms are cleaned/prepared twice daily and slippers, dressing gowns and plenty of towels are provided, along with or the usual batroom amenities such as soaps, gels, lotions etc. And they do leave some lovely Venition Chocolates in the romo when you first get there! Overall I was very impressed with the hotel, especially considering the deal I got meant it only cost about \u00c2\u00a380 ($150) a night.

On the contrary, our room was huge and fabulous with gorgeous hardwood floors, a terrace, flat screen television, internet access, and a spacious bathroom. I loved the hotel so much I wanted to extend my stay. The hotel is in a great location just minutes from San Marco square and the water bus. The hotel does have a few quirks, for example YOU ONLY GET 1 room key, even if there are 2 people. In European hotels you have to leave the room key in the light switch to turn on the electricity in the room. There were times that I forgot the key in the light switch and neither myself nor my friends had another key to get back into the room so we had to call housekeeping to let us in. The other quirk is that the room DOES NOT HAVE an iron and you CANNOT borrow one from the hotel; so if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bring a travel iron you are out of luck. TIP: Water taxis are EXPENSIVE!!!! Best and cheapest way to get around are the water buses which run 24 hour a day. FYI: the train station is only a 15 ride from the hotel, but a water taxi cost 70 euros (roughly $93 USD). You can catch the #82 or #1 Water bus to the Rialto Bridge for only 5 Euros (roughly just under $7 USD) and the hotel is a 7 minute walk from the stop. If you have a lot of bags you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to carry the guys w/wheel barrels are a worthwhile investment for b/c there are no land taxis and you have a few bridges to cross in that short walk to the hotel).

My husband and I visited Rome (June 12-16) and Venice (from June 16-19) for our 20th Wedding Anniversary and had a fabulous time staying at the Palace B. The hotel was absolutely wonderful. I had been to Venice as a teenager and this hotel was a welcome change from my previous accomodations! The room, while not large, was very clean and tastefully decorated. If you are not into contemporary and prefer more of traditional decor, then this may not be the place for you. A wonderful sculpture by Artist Botero is in the lobby--very cool. I particularly liked the newness of it and the friendly staff. The hotel is close to all major attractions and has some great little mom and pop bars right down the street. We happened to be in Venice during the World Cup match between the US and Italy. It was very fun to watch the game with the locals and get a feel for how exciting the sport is in Europe. The staff was great and provided some wonderful restaurant recommendations. One restaurant, Ristorante Sempione was wonderful. Moderately priced with great food and wine--try lasagna--it was great! The restaurant while not fancy, has been in Venice for a long, long time run by the same family. If you get there at the right time, you might be lucky enough to get the table at the open window/terrace, where you can watch the gondolas float by. Very romantic. I found nothing to complain about regarding this hotel and would stay there again in a heartbeat. Make a point to take a trip to see the beach at Lido. On one of our days, we took the vaparetto and ate lunch in Lido and went to the beach. Less hectic/congested than Venice and a nice boat ride on the way over. Regarding transportation, I would recommend taking the water taxi to the hotel at the time of your arrival at the rail station, or airport. While costly, it beats wasting time trying to find your hotel. We were lucky, as we found another couple that was going to the Hotel Bonvecchiati, that is right next door to the PB and we were able to split the cost of the water taxi. On the way out of town, we were leaving very early out of the Marco Polo airport and also found another couple to split the costs of the water taxi--this was very costly as they charged us something like 90 Euros/couple for the taxi and then for the shuttle from the port to the airport.

We are very picky travelers and found the PB to be an excellent hotel and an excellent value; it's not inexpensive, but for the quality and size of the rooms, it's a good deal. The location is terrific -- very central, yet quiet --and the rooms are large, beautifully furnished and exceptionally clean. We particularly liked the modern style; after a stay in Venice, one grows tired of brocade and glitz, and the PB is a calming, soothing counterpoint. The staff was extremely professional and helpful, the entire hotel was sparkling clean and fresh and the location great. We'll choose the PB over the Danieli or Gritti next time as well.", "Date": "May 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel, Friendly staff, High Standard Accommodation\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5068915", "Content": "Stayed in Palace Bonvecchiati in May 2006, it was heating up outside, so their excellent air con was the fastest I have seen to cool down a room.

It was on the main path from riato to p.s. marco so you never got lost, and they have a water door, so the taxi / gondola drop off was right to the hotel. We loved this hotel, and my elderly parents did too. They have a jacuzzi, steam room, and sauna which you need to book a time for (no charge though), which were lovely after a days walking around. A gym is there too which doesn't need to be booked and has all the equipment you need. We all had a massage too, which rounded off the day's walking nicely.

The reviews on this site were of huge help in choosing the right hotel - though I say it myself, my husband has a wife with very high standards when it comes to holidays!, and it took him much research to find the right place. It is absolutely true though, that you should get a water-taxi direct to the hotel (the hotel can arrange this) - arriving via the water-bus, then trying to find the hotel for the first time is not an experience to repeat, (especially in the heat of a july afternoon). The water-taxi trip is more expensive, but is priceless in terms of a unique way to arrive and leave this beautiful city.", "Date": "April 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kent UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5019610", "Content": "We spent 4 nights at this great hotel,over Easter.& I chose this hotel mainly due to reading tripadvisor reviews . Stayed in a VERY clean Superior Double room. We liked: 1) The walk in wardrobe with good lighting, full length morror & plenty of hangers, including some padded hangers for posh stuff ! 2) The small mini-bar fridge, good for keeping our shop bought water / chocolate etc., cold. 3) The enormous white towelling bathrobes & slippers provided to use for going to the spa 4) The complimentary chocs & bathroom goodies ( quite an array ) Also the room safe ( one of those ones where you tap in a code to use it) 5) The room was cleaned to a VERY high standard, both in the morning & also in the evening when more sweets were left & used towels replaced again. 6) The turquoise marble bathroom with loads of soft towels & a weighing scales ( NOT good when you've been eating so much delicious food ). VERY powerful shower in the bath that can soak the floor, if not careful, but there was a separate, hand-held, spray attachment that could be used to shower without drenching your hair do, ladies ! (hairdryer provided in bathroom) 7) A very good gym & HOT HOT HOT (although tiny) sauna & steam room. These are on the 4th floor & only reached by one of the two lifts (the one furthest from the Reception Desk). 8) Complimentary umbrellas provided, by the front door, in case of rain. 9) SUPERB central location of hotel. A bit disapointed with: 1) The jacuzzi which was VERY chilly & for some reason you had to 'reserve' a time to use this at the main Reception desk (no charge for this). Views across the surrounding roof tops, but the sun was streaming in the spa's windows, so even though chilly to remain in the jacuzzi too long, it was still very relaxing. 2) The modern flat screen TV was great, but couldn't get the remote controller to work properly, even though the batteries were OK ??? 3) The truly AWFUL tea at breakfast....stick with the coffee. Be aware that you must hand in your room key, to reception, every time you go out. also that the main front doors are locked after 22:00hrs. There is a bell alongside the door, for the porter to respond. Overall.......a VERY clean, modern decor hotel & great central location.

The hotel has a nice gym with modern workout machines by TechnoGym, a jacuzzi, saunas etc.., although in saying that, we didn't use it as we had enough exercise walking in Venice. We found the location to be ideally placed for both the Rialto and San Marco. Do venture off away from the main areas for some beautiful views, good food and a less touristy feel. Venice is expensive and charges are often hidden such as charges for background music. Tip: when wanting a coffee or snack if you sit in San Marco square beware of sitting down where there is a live 5-piece band playing they charge for the honour of listening, they even charged our toddler full price for the music.

I booked this hotel because of its great position (less than five minutes walk to Piazza San Marco and Rialto Bridge, really closed to the major attractions of the city) and because it's a lovely boutique hotel with a good value (not so pricey if you think you're in the heart of Venice) . Our room (a deluxe one) was clean, modern, pleasant and spacious, though not overlooking the canal as we requested when booking online on their website. The LCD flat tv is amazing but there's not a great selections of channels. Green marble bathroom was ok, with tub and a shower with a good pressure (even if it's easy to get a completely wet floor after a shower..) and some good products for personal care. Palace Bonvecchiati is a new and stylish hotel, but i really don't know why they still use keys and not electronic cards for their rooms, when it's clear that everything is ready for the use of electronic keys. Everytime you want to go to your room you have to ask for your room-key at the reception and it may be annoying. Unfortunately the fitness center (with turkish bath, sauna and jacuzzi) was out of service and with great disappointment we couldn't try it. The staff was helpful and nice, always ready to help us when needing. Giving umbrellas to their guests when it's raining was a good idea (that not every four star hotel have). Breakfast served on the ground floor bar was good. There's not a restaurant inside Palace Bonvecchiati, but just in front of the hotel there's a really good one called \"Bistrot de Venise\" with awesome tradition venetian cousine (re-visited with a modern twist) and you must try it.
