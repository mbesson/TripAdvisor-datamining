{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Budget Accomodation Stayed here for 17 nights as it was close to my sister in Randwick. Handy for us in that regards. We are a family of 2 adults and 2 children, 13 and 10. We had quiet a large room with a double and 2 single beds, small kitchen area with sink, refrigerator, microwave, toaster and kettle, ensuite bathroom with shower. This accommodation was basic. The towels and linen are changed weekly but I was given the linen to change the beds myself! We really only slept in St. Mark's Lodge and had our breakfast there in the morning, other than that we were out all day every day. It is handy location with buses to the city and bondi junction where you can catch trains to all areas from.", "Date": "Aug 7, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR912762765", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Gillym32"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d669568-r8366956-St_Mark_s_Lodge-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html", "HotelID": "669568", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
