Super, super nice folks. Clean and extremely close to Plaza Espana where Don Quixote / Cervantes statue is. Walking to the El Cortes Department Store one block off the Main drag, Gran Via. Not necessarily outfitted with refrigerator/ mini bar, Alicia ran across the street to get us a glass of ice. If you are looking for a location, location, location and GREAT WIFI INTERNET. Has elevator and AC.... Room is older but fit us well.", "Date": "June 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol", "Title": "\u201cA bit shabby, but great location.\u201d", "Author": "allotmentandy", "ReviewID": "UR122665428", "Content": "Booked this hotel after reading reviews here because we needed a room for two nights in Madrid, and the location versus the price gave us the best combination. It is a bit rub down, the furnishings a bit tatty, and our room was tiny, with just enough room to get past the beds to the equally tiny bathroom. In terms of value for money, it was o.k. given that this is in the center of a capital city only a short stroll from various attractions. It was a bit noisy at night. I do not feel that I overpaid. Our reception was friendly and fine, as was our departure. We did not use their resturant for breakfast, as we prefer to go out to local cafes, which usually provide a better offer, and there were plenty to choose from nearby. In similar circumstances I might consider staying there again. Great Moroccan resturant about 200 m away up the road.", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cVery mediocre European style hotel, in poor condition\u201d", "Author": "supernova87a", "ReviewID": "UR110443923", "Content": "I feel the need to provide a recent review of this place. I almost paid for a room myself (to the tune of 60 Euro/night), but at the last minute shared a room with a friend who had already booked here. I'm glad I didn't pay, because I would have felt really foolish to spend that kind of money on such a poor quality place. This hotel looks like it's about to be demolished. Parts of the lobby, staircases, etc are walled off by sheet rock, as if temporary, but clearly it has become permanent. The lighting is the cold fluorescent kind, and certainly doesn't give the feel of an inviting hotel. When I arrived and asked to go up to the room to meet my friend, the receptionist said she'd have to call the room to make sure I was a valid guest. She said there was no answer, and just let me proceed up. When I got to the room, and mentioned this to my friend, we had a laugh because the room has no phone. The room itself, two beds overlooking the street, was very unremarkable. Beds weren't soft, pillows and sheets pretty thin. The air conditioning was weak, but at least the bathroom was clean and serviceable. I don't understand how hotels like this stay in business. Look carefully for some other places!", "Date": "May 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cHas its good points\u201d", "Author": "oz_oldie", "ReviewID": "UR84817497", "Content": "I stayed here a couple of times and was given quite spacious, well-furnished, freshly painted rooms. The windows were double glazed. As noted by others the location and ease of finding is great. If you book day trips through Viator the tour operator is 2 minutes walk away. There were no problems at all with my first room, the second had a leak from the toilet and a diabolical shower curtain, you know, the cling-film type! There was plenty of hot water with good pressure. Cleaning was thorough. For some reason the lobby has a really nasty smell, very off-putting, can't believe anyone would want to breakfast on that floor! Price was very reasonable - I paid double the rate elsewhere in Spain and the rooms were in no way superior . I might stay at this hotel again myself (for fear of something worse?) but wouldn't send friends there because of the few objectionable features.", "Date": "October 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "home", "Title": "\u201cGreat staff, Great location, ok hotel\u201d", "Author": "ashleigh1105", "ReviewID": "UR65934956", "Content": "This hotel is half a block from the Metro station, a block off the Gran Via (and all the shopping) a block from two grocery stores, and right off of Plaza de Espa\u00f1a. The staff are so helpful, they even had a hairdryer to lend us! There are lock boxes downstairs and luggage storage. They serve breakfast in the morning and charge it to your room, so when the ladies say \"camara\" to you, they don't want to take your picture! We used this hotel as our \"base of operations\" while in Spain, and came back for two day stays between Sevilla and Barcelona. They let us leave our extra baggage while we traveled and let us check back in early when we got back in town NO EXTRA CHARGE! The staff was so friendly and more than made up for the fact that we stayed there one night when Madrid won a major soccer game. The locals were up honking their horns until 6 am! We also were there during the festival of San Isidro, and there was a concert stage set up in the Plaza, but it wasn't that loud.", "Date": "May 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel\u201d", "Author": "DublinMember1616", "ReviewID": "UR7696931", "Content": "I stayed here with a group of friends in March.
