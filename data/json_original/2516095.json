It lists the celebrities who stayed there, what rooms they liked, and why. Though I doubt any VIPs stay there now, it persists as a throwback to the way things probably were in the 1950s and 1960s. It looks that way, too. The bad things came with a bit of good in them, and vice versa: 1. Very convenient to LAX and car rental return (nothing bad about that) 2. Good breakfast variety but the room is very, very crowded. Considering the target customer, could they consider leaving this open with a more limited choice for a longer period? 3. TV reception went on and off. 4. When I was settling into the room, all power was off on one side. After I notified the front desk, someone came very quickly. He then needed help from someone else. This took quite awhile. No offer to change rooms, but they did fix the problem. 5. I pre-paid Expedia's \"lowest rate\" but a signboard marquee in front advertised lower rates. 6. Parking is limited, not reserved, and iffy. It is not what I would call a safe area. The parking area is very well-lit at night, probably because of this. Pay attention to where you park, in relation to where your room may be. 7. Several homeless people loitering around the adjoining Denny's, asking for money. I respect the hotel may have no control over this. 8. Looking for an ice machine, I saw a sign (clearly had been there a long time) saying \"Ice Machine Upstairs\" but found no machine. I asked a maintenance person where it was, he said \"downstairs.\" I pointed to the sign and he said \"oh yes, that is confusing isn't it,\" and then about 30 minutes later the sign was gone. So he did his job well and reported it. 9. WiFi included in room rate was of good strength. 10. This property seems a little more expensive than it should be in relation to what other motels are available not far away. For the price, i think they should not charge extra for a mini-refrigerator. 11. Little coffee machine included in room at the room price. 12. The hotel sprawls through a large and slightly confusing area. Read signs very closely. Summary: OK. Just OK. No major complaints but it was just a bit depressing in there.", "Date": "May 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hamburg", "Title": "\u201cI really like this hotel\u201d", "Author": "jayceeehh", "ReviewID": "UR129144882", "Content": "I really like this hotel.

The beds were comfortable, though I did find the pillows to be a bit on the hard side. The bathroom was spacious, although it was only stocked with shampoo and soap. No lotion, no conditioner.

Do NOT expect luxury, only functionality. They have an airport shuttle that runs every half hour to LAX around the clock, and parking is free. They also have free wi-fi and in-room coffee makers. Now, the rooms do have wallpaper like you stepped into the 80's, but if you're looking for a clean, safe place to stay right before or right after a long day of travel without breaking the bank, I would definitely recommend this place. They offer a free continental breakfast in the mornings, 6-9am, enough to hold you over until lunch. Again, everyone was very courteous in the dining room. The service all around was personable and exceeded my expectations. One warning, if you are a light sleeper, noise could be an issue.

The room smelled strongly of bleach (had to keep the window open) and the bathroom smelled mildewy and I had to run the fan in there the whole time I was there as I'm allergic to mildew/mold. The towels are cheap and the bedspread and blanket had some holes in them. The A/C unit was not cold and kept shutting off in the middle of the night? Not sure if they have them on some type of timer or what? So I didn't sleep well as I kept getting up and trying to get the A/C to work again. The furniture was crappy and before the afternoon was done I had a sore back from sitting in the chairs. On the plus side, it was very close to airport. Scary neighborhood though and I wouldn't walk around on the streets there. Denny's had good food. Everyone was nice. The lobby was always clean, the grounds were clean, they had a lot of people working. Whatever I asked for they did promptly. When I asked for more towels they quickly gave them to me at the front desk. The breakfast was all cold stuff, bagels, pastry, cereal, they did have oatmeal packs but I didn't see them until after I had eaten, they are by the coffee machine, juice, milk. It was ok if you are ok with a cold breakfast, could have went to Denny's for a hot breakfast, but why pay for it if you don't have to.", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charleston, South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cSo Happy no one like this place but ME!\u201d", "Author": "JAUL1113", "ReviewID": "UR119196381", "Content": "YOU have got to be kidding me...........

The van was clearly marked as Travelodge LAX -- worth mentioning as some hotels near the airport use a shuttle service that goes to many hotels, and the only identifiers for the hotels they serve are the electronic lighted signs that scroll names across (not exactly the most fun thing to try and decipher when you've just come off a 15 hour flight).

Just be sure and remember to ask for the code when you get your room key. The desk clerk will write it down for you. The bathrooms are slightly dark here and the shower was very dark, but the high-pressure head and hot water made up for it. It was perfect for freshening up in-transit, and they supply soaps and shampoo just like you would expect so if your bags are checked through you needn't worry about buying toiletries beyond what you're probably carrying in your favorite TSA-approved freezer bag.

Our room was in a way- back wing. It was perfectly adequate. The beds were comfortable, linens were clean, everything worked fine. The staff at the front were helpful and polite. The breakfast bar is really just bagels and toast and juice, but it's free and fast if that will hold you. If not, there's a Denny's right there and you can get whatever you want 24 hours. There's also a Carl's Jr on the way to the Hilton and other fast food in the other direction if that's more your style. I'll definitely stay there again, but will ask for a 2nd floor room facing the pool. You just cannot beat the price -- it cost me less than half of what I would have paid at the big hotel, and I got a little exercise waking to and from the meetings every day, too.

The main reason I chose to return to this hotel was the location - it is one of the closest hotels to LAX, and the hotel provides a free shuttle to and from the airport 24/7. There is a computer in the lobby where you can check-in online and print your boarding pass free of charge. Both of these things made our lives much easier, especially as we had to be at the airport at 3am! The rooms are average motel rooms, slightly dated but clean and definately comfortable for a one night stay. The room had a small window so there was not much natural light, but we did not spend much time sitting in the room so this was Ok. The corridor outside our room was temporarily blocked off for maintenance with pot plants, wooden boards and \"Do Not Cross\" tape, which did not look fantastic! I am not sure if the hotel would be appropriate for a longer stay, but for a stop-over before or after a flight it is fine! There is a Dennys onsite, but typically the night we were there it was closed for maintenance! There are two petrol stations just outside (30 seconds walk) also, so you can get sandwiches and snacks if you're desperate. There are self-serve laundry facilities. The front desk staff were ok- efficient at checking us in, but not overly friendly, although we did get them to smile eventually! We asked them if it was possible to get a public bus to Marina Del Ray and we were told that it is not possible. However I had done my research before the holiday and I thought that we could. Sure enough, we crossed the road and stood outside \"Carls Jrs\" fast-food restaurant and caught Big Blue Bus number 3 to Marina Del Ray (1$; 15 minutes approx). There is free wifi throughout the hotel so luckily you can find this kind of information yourself online.

It's like a tropical oasis near the airport. Everyone was so nice and the room was older but clean and comfortable.

I called Dennys and they brought it to the hotel front desk. Then I called the front desk and they put my coat on the shuttle, where I met the same driver who graciously handed me my coat, at the airport with plenty of time for me to catch my plane.

We decided to stay at the Travelodge LAX because LA was a one night stop over and the hotel is close to the airport, the price was good and included continental breakfast, and they offered a \"sleepy bear package\" (a bear themed room with cookies for the kids). I must admit I wasn't expecting much due to many of the poor reviews, and I am glad that I didn't have high expectations. The room was nasty. The smell at the front door was something like the boquet of a swaggie's armpit and inside was almost as bad. Stale cigarettes in a \"non smoking\" room. Carpet looked like skinned dog hide but it wasn't so much the look as the greasy feel under the feet that was terrifying. I think the walls had a patterned wall paper on them at one point but looks more like a young child has gone to town finger painting with fecal matter. My favourite, when reading reviews, is when the writer of said review tells how the toilet backed up. How often does that happen in the States? It seems every second review tells of this sad indictment. Guess i must be the second review because our dunny backed up! The staff were friendly enough at the reception but when cleaning staff were told of the toilet backing up as we were fleeing from this hollywood movie set, English seemed a little too difficult understand. Front desk were more understanding of English, however. their response was quite efficient: \"no problem, we will fix.\"...it almost sounded like an apology don't you think..?

When you like to have a more quiet room, ask for the rear side, all of them are clean. The premise maintenance is good and the hobby of the ground manager is the garden. Unfortunately the labeling of plants has changed. In former days the premises looked like a botanic garden with explanations and names. Perfect for the children. May be..... I do not know, where the other tripadvisor writers like to go swimming, I usually go into the pool and enjoy. The pool area and the pool itself is cleaned every day by the ground staff. A kids section is provided in the pool. The comment with bed bugs is for me not understandable. The beds are clean and the matress is renewed frequent. The rooms are clean and remodelled frequent on demand.. Towels and amenities are OK and you can obtain anything, you have forgotten, from the ffront desk. In addition there is a small shop at the entrance providing medicals, picture postcards, cold beverages and other things as souvenirs. On the area of the hotel there is a Denny\u00b4s restaurant. Unfortunately the bar has changed the opening days. Only friday and saturday you can have the \"real bar feeling2 however, during the other evenings the Denny\u00dfs staff is proud to serve you the \"toxic drinks\" when you are arrive middle in the night from Europe. Lots of free parking is available on the premises. You need a parking permit from the front desk (free!). Newspaper every day is free. Wifi is free, you need the code for that from the front desk (free). Breakfast is free for hotel guests and the remodelled breakfast area is OK. Just show the room key. When the hotel is fully booked, the space in the breakfast area is very limited. (...and it is often fully booked...) Only the time 09:00 of closing the door should be extended. Visitors from other countries have to battle with the time shift and jet lag. For shure you can go to Denny\u00b4s for breakfast, if you are really late in the morning. When you are there and have problems with anything, go to the front desk and they will check it. We will come back. For sure. Not to forget: they provide fridgerators and microwave in the room for a small charge. All in one: The hotel is a clean place, having the airport in the vicinity.

This property would benefit from somewhat better maintenance, but it's limited to very chipped paint around doorways etc; in my room everything was clean and functional. If you're searching by price this is worth a bit more than El Segundo which is futher away than you think and you should know that Inglewood is also much further from LAX and can be a rather dodgy neighbourhood at night (do NOT take your children or your Gran to Inglewood), so this location is relatively safe and MUCH more convenient. The hotel runs a shuttle bus around the airport terminals regularly - make sure you stand in the right place outside your terminal, look for the kerb markings for \"Hotel Shuttles\", they can't pick you up elsewhere. If you can call the front desk when you arrive they'll send the bus out for you - make sure they know WHICH TERMINAL you've arrived at - there are a LOT!

I didn't complain during my stay, so I realize there is a possibility that the situation could have been remedied, but I just checked in for a few hours to sleep so I didn't want to waste potential time sleeping by switching rooms or something. I was a single woman traveling alone, and my room was so far at the back of the hotel, I had to walk very far to get there from the lobby or parking lot, the rest of the hotel was eerily empty, and there were a lot of homeless people hanging around the area near the parking lot. So between these factors, I did not feel very safe here. I specifically chose to stay in a no smoking room because I have breathing problems and I am sensitive to it, but my room smelled strongly of cigarette smoke when I got there. It faded, but started again, these two girls kept coming back and smoking right outside my door! I asked them to please smoke somewhere else, but they returned twice that I know of. The shower was AWFUL. It fluctuated from ice cold to almost warm, and then as soon as I could get it to the warmest setting possible (probably about room temperature), it would quickly go cold again. I just wanted to relax after a long day and I ended up fighting with the shower for quite some time, before giving up and taking a lukewarm/ice cold shower. The next morning I was woken up by a small dog barking really loudly and constantly. The room looked clean, but nothing really felt clean though I couldn't put my finger on why. Maybe my situation could have been remedied if I asked for my room to be switched, but I was only there less than twelve hours so I didn't want to waste my time, especially because it was likely a new room would have problems as well.

There were 6 of us: my mom and I were in room 207 and my brother, his wife and 2 kids (8 & 11) were in room 206. We only stayed for one night, Saturday Feb. 6 through Sunday Feb. 7, 2010. We only stayed one night because we were headed to Carnival Splendor's Mexican Riviera cruise; and we like to fly in a day early because, coming from the northeast, we never know what the weather will be like! lol The hotel is on a main road but you don't hear the traffic while in your room. However, you do hear the planes coming in and out of LAX; but the noise isn't as bad as you would think. Now, I'm not a light sleeper, nor am I a heavy sleeper, but if it helps you, let me say that I wasn't woken, not once, by the noise from any incoming or outgoing planes at LAX. The biggest positives about this hotel are its location, the variety of food available in the continental breakfast, the service, and THE BED'S! I've stayed in MANY hotels; from crappy motels in MA, to 3 and 4 star hotels all over the country, and 5 star Hotels in Spain & Portugal. NO HOTEL HAS HAD A MORE COMFORTABLE BED THAN THIS TRAVELODGE...NONE! I'm not over exaggerating, this bed was soft but firm at the same time..I can't even explain it. If I could've taken home the mattress I would've! lol However, I didn't like the pillows; they were too soft for my taste...but hey in my opinion it was a fair trade. My back didn't hurt in the morning and I woke up very well rested. Even my mom, who \"can't live without\" her bed (a pricey Serta because of her back probs), had nothing but high remarks for the mattress! The hotel offers free Shuttle service to and from the airport which was a plus for us. Also, both front desk employees (overnight and in the morning), were extremely helpful and very nice. The morning manager helped us find a taxi that took us to Long Beach Cruise Terminal for $70! Yes..all 6 of us with all of our bags...which were plentiful lol. The continental breakfast offered more than I anticipated: a variety of muffins, danishes, cinnamon rolls, toast (white and wheat), waffles, fresh fruit, coffee (good coffee too...which is saying something since I can't live without Dunkin' Donuts!), and two different juices (apple and orange). Even though we were on a main street, the area seemed pretty safe. We even walked to a restaurant close by called Stick N' Steins (recommended by the night desk clerk..it was excellent) at 9 pm, and we felt perfectly safe. And in the morning, the kids used the outdoor heated pool, which they loved. Now comes the bad. The room was typical of what you would expect in a 2 star hotel. The carpets could use a GOOD deep cleaning. There were even staples near the bed which my mom stepped on..she wasn't happy. Also, when we first entered the room my mom needed to use the restroom and found a hair on the toilet seat and toilet paper in the toilet. It's not like there was pee in the toilet bowl or anything, it just looked like maybe the hair came from the cleaning crew and they used toilet paper to wipe something and just chucked it into the toilet. We complained about that but there was no cleaning crew on duty at the time so we just used our own Lysol wipes (which we never travel w/out) and wiped it ourselves. The room had a coffeemaker w/ coffee, a microwave, and a fridge...which were all spotless. But, the problems continued in the bathroom. The grout on the floor, and the grout around the tub and inside the tub were full of mildew. The whole bathroom needs a good cleaning with some Soft Scrub and good ol' fashioned elbow grease...EW. The last thing I was disappointed with was the TV. It was big enough, but the color and picture on it were horrible. I know, you don't stay in a hotel to watch TV, but it's a little annoying when you're trying to watch the news and the anchor looks like an Oompah Loompa due to bad color and fuzzy picture! Other than those few issues, the Travelodge LAX South was perfect for one night and offered everything that we needed. A Ralph's, IHOP, other various restaurants, convenience store, and a strip mall are all within waking distance.

Didnt catch the shuttle at LAX (went straight to Dollar to get the car) so can't comment on that. Staff seemed friendly enough but we found there were no elevators and had to carry all our luggage up stairs to the second floor! The hotel grounds are nice with a great pool and nice gardens and the whole complex is surrounded by a huge security fence ( you'll discover why when you go out! ) however finding space to park can be difficult as the main car park is shared with the adjacent Dennys. The first room was terrible. Nice view but the balcony doors didnt look secure. The whole room looked in severe need of renovation. Bathroom was badly lit and the shower only trickled out. No noise from the airport in this room but the fact that there was a door to the room next door and there seemed to be a gang war going on in there kept us up until it sounded like the police turned up to turf them out. Did not feel at all safe! Second room was much better. Looked to have been recently refurbished and was light and airy with double glazed balcony doors. Sadly this was spoiled by a half inch gap all the way round the entry door which we discovered when we thought there was an aircraft landing in the corridor outside! (Backs onto the airport side) Couldnt have the aircon on high as it was so noisy but didnt make any difference as the aircraft and street noise through the badly fitted door kept us awake all night! Breakfast was not bad but is served in a room the size of a large closet and there are only a few tables outside to sit at which was poor considering the size of the hotel. The Denny's next door did a much better breakfast though obviously you have to pay. Imagine most people staying here will bring or rent a car, which you WILL NEED to get around. The area is very run down and is surrounded by strip clubs and sex shops! Also seems to be a large population of local vagrants that try to con money out of you as I was stupid enough to fall for the first day, I felt a lot happier the second stay when we were told we could park in th back lot (which is inside the security fence and accessed with the room key) as i often wondered if the car would still be outisde in the morning when parked in the main car park. Walking back to the hotel from Dollar was nervewracking even for 2 young men. Area not appropriate or safe for families, lone travellers or anyone of anyone fo a nervous disposition should beware.

SIMPLY OUTSTANDING! At last! I found the solution to my LAX travel situations. This property is a mind-blowing value (my rate was only $62) that's incredibly convenient. MY TIP: You are about 300 yards from my FAVE place to rent cars while in LA: FOX CAR RENTAL. The Travelodge/Fox car rental combo is a money-saver for anyone or family who's coming into Los Angeles via LAX...and just needs to base for one night, before launching into their LA vacation getaway. First of all, let's rate this motel for what it promises you, OKAY? You are staying in a property adjacent to LAX. This means stripper clubs and panhandlers, folks! If you find this unnerving, then GO STRAIGHT to your DISNEY hotel, parents! But this property hires a rent-a-cop nightly to watch the place. Your rooms are \"behind\" a gate-locked area, so you're not exposed to the area-at-large. I felt very safe. The rooms are clean, LARGE and comfy. My in-room coffeemaker with full-spectrum cable TV was a nice way to start my morning, but the capper was having an iron that was actually \"clean!\" (Almost always, they are scorched and unuseable! Ha!) Onsite is a well-stocked gift/convenience shop, so Moms can stock-up their purses with granola bars/juice. And adjacent is a DENNY's. Yes, perhaps more pricey than your hometown Denny's in Hooterville, USA...but you're staying in LA, folks. YOUR rules/standards are out the window. Having this Denny's right next door is incredibly convenient for a stack of pancakes to get you squared-away for the morning! You simply must consider this hotel for what it is: AN EXCELLENT place to A) stay when you have an obnoxiously early LAX flight the next morning...or B) stay if you have a late-night arrival to LAX and need to get a rental car the next day. This Travelodge is a great solution for when you just need a place to \"reconnoiter\" before you launch into your LA vacation. I walked over to FOX and chatted-up an LAPD bike cop enroute! The neighborhood's patrolled. Now...if you think you're going to \"go out for a little walk to check out the neighborhood?\" Respectfully, you're out of your mind! You just don't DO THAT here, folks! Fuggadabbaddit! So...disregard the negative reviews that, IMO, come from amateur travelers. Any mega-huge, world-famous airport will have the adjacent contingent of seedy commerce. Therefore, spend $150+ for your few hours sleep, as those highrise properties are, indeed, in the LAX area.! But me? I'll stay here. Shuttle. Value. Clean. I will recommend this motel to friends/family. BTW: I understand the Travelodge franchise is trying very hard to \"change\" it's image from a low grade tourist-class property (ala \"Knight's Inn\")...to a nicer, more upgraded standard (ala \"Quality\" or \"Ramada\") of tourist-class accommodations. In closing, if you don't like stripper clubs, XXX theaters or panhandlers in your eyesight, then high-tail it out of the LAX area! If you're like me...and all you want is a good place to sleep that doesn't smell funny? YOU WILL LOVE THIS PLACE because of it's incredible location. PS to those who talk about NOISE... ummm...scuse me...but you're at LAX?!! Solution: EAR PLUGS. I wouldn't leave home without 'em! Although I didn't find a need for them. Yes. It's a window air conditioner, so you'll have that \"noise\" from the unit. But again...for $62 to have THIS MUCH CONVENIENCE?!!! I'm laughing and turning cartwheels! Have a great LA stay!

I went to LA for a quick shopping break and to pick up my new puppy. As soon as I got to the main gate of the airport I phoned the hotel, 50 minutes later they picked me up and took me to this hotel that is located only 5 minutes away by car. The gentleman at the front desk that night was actually polite. That night was actually ok. The room is nothing special but you can't really expect much for the price. Early the next morning I asked the shuttle driver if he could drop me off at the airport on his next shuttle service (I wasn't leaving yet but I needed to pick up my dog) In a very rude way he answered he didn't know and then he said the car was full and turned away leaving me talking alone. Later that day was supposed to check out however my flight scheduled had been moved to the next morning due to the weather. I went to the front desk at 10 am to see if they had room available for that night which they confirmed. By this time my credit card had been locked as I did not notified my bank I was going to be traveling those days so I was to get back to the room, get some cash and come back to the front desk to check out and switch rooms. I go back to my room, finish packing and then try to call my bank to their toll free number to unblock my credit card but I couldn't call out, I then call the front desk and they tell me I can't call out anymore because they have already checked me out and that I need to \"immediately\" leave the room (check out time was still 1.30 hrs away). I went back to the front desk to try to work it out and make the toll free call to my bank... long story short these two ladies were absolutely nasty so I checked out. I asked the driver if he could take me to the airport this time, his answer was beyond impolite. I couldn't get a taxi with my large dog at that time in the morning so I walked with my luggage, its kennel and my dog to a very nice 4.5 star hotel right next to the airport. The difference in service was like day and night. I ended up staying one more extra night just for pleasure. This other hotel definitely made me forget about that uncomfortable experience at Travelodge LAX.

In my opinion it's just the standard US service which doesn't often come with a smile, that's just the way it is and if you accept that then I think you will have a great stay.

We decided to decline the extra charge so she assigned us to a room about as far back as you can go....No. 168. Well, guess what, that room was already occupied. We opened the door and there was luggage, clothing and obvious signs that people were staying there. After another long trek to the desk, we were given room #170.

However, there were far more guests than the shuttle could safely accommodate forcing several guests to sit on the laps of others and some to stand in the doorway.
