{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Piccadilly is the word for [-] The hotel Piccadilly was not a good hotelthe only good thing about it, was the location in downtown Florence. The rooms were somewhat clean, but the bathrooms were disgusting. They smelt very bad, and the showers were just a shower head in the middle of the bathroom. The beds were decent, but the sheets were not clean. The windows did not shut, and the heater didn't work. We had no electricity one night, and there was a dog running around the hotel all the time.", "Date": "Dec 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR845789067", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "iwearglasses"}, {"Content": "Great value budget accomodation We were a little anxious when we saw the hotel from the road as it was cross sectioned by 2 very busy streets. However we were put at the back of the hotel over looking a small courtyard and it was very quiet and peaceful. ( On my booking form I asked for a room with a view)Our room was large and airy with great air con. The bathroom was quirky, very old fashioned tiles which may not be to some people's taste but it was clean, the shower worked so I had nothing to complain about, in fact I thought it was charming and made a change from characterless white.The breakfast was OK, mainly strange coloured pastries but plenty of them.It was in a good location and within walking distance to all the main attractions in Florence.We paid 102 euros for 2 nights and did not expect much. We were really pleasantly surprised with what we got for our money.", "Date": "Oct 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR281186893", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "DonnaMFriendly"}, {"Content": "Nosotros estuvimos 3 d\u94c6as aqu\u94c6...   showReview(19868388, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR800199198", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Le camere sono pulite e...   showReview(18521991, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR808533961", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d1012900-r22744026-Hotel_Piccadilly-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "1012900", "Price": "$85"}}
