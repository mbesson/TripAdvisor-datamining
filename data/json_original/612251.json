We had a shower and the warm steam from it set off some sort of alarm and reception rang us up and accused us of smoking in the room. No bar facilities at all, just a vending machine.

It is a little way out of the centre but I think this has advantages. Unlike in or near Sol (central Madrid), there are no seedy characters or beggers around, It is much easier to find a supermarket, the restaurants are cheaper and aren't touristy. I also stayed in Sol and I prefer the location of the Sunotel. The rooms are average, comfortable enough. The door key is hard to use and I sometimes had to fiddle with it, other people were having trouble with it too. No English language TV stations but it's like that everywhere in Spain! I stayed here for three nights. The first night was my own booking and the other two were part of a tour. On the morning of 12 March I asked the guy at the counter to print something for me. It was the same guy who checked me in the day before. He did it then when I went to get the print out he asked me to pay 10 euros for breakfast. I said I didn't have breakfast and that it wasn't a part of my booking. He said he knew I didn't have breakfast but that I had to pay anyway... So I did thinking maybe it was written on my booking form from hotels.com somewhere (which I later checked and it wasn't), this seemed very dodgy and I later saw in the elevator that the price of breakfast was not even 10 euros, it was 14!. Other interactions I had with the staff indicated that some were not that polite overall, however they seemed to speak English to a reasonable degree. Having said that, on the other two nights I stayed as part of a tour, the breakfast was included and it is particularly good at this place.

I can't comment on the rack rate as we got it as part of a package deal, but the rate we paid was excellent value. It was very easy to find the hotel from the closest metro stop, it is about a five minute walk along one of the main roads (opposite the bright red vips convenience store). The reception staff were very friendly and welcoming. The room was an adequate size, very clean and kitted out in a modern style. I really appreciated the hairdryer which saved me from packing mine and shower was powerful with plenty hot water. The only problem I found was their wasn't an overhead light in the main room, just lamps and there was a shortage of plug sockets so we did most of our dressing/make up etc in the bathroom. The breakfast was very good. The selection was typical of a Spanish chain hotel buffet (cereals, pastries, cheeses, breads with a toaster, hot food, tortillas, jams, fruit, hot drinks and juices). There was plenty of it, it was fresh and constantly kept stocked and tidy. It was very easy to get from the hotel to the sights. You're about a 10 minute walk to the home of Real Madrid and to get further afield their metro system is convenient and very easy to use. It's similar in size to London's tube system but their carriages are more spacious and they run from about 6am until about 2am. It goes to the airport too which makes for a hassle free journey into the city. My tip would be if you're flying in with easyjet, buy one of their tourist transport passes (advertised in their sky shop mag and covers 3 days). We didn't rush around everything and we used two 10 ticket passes each plus an extra single ticket back to the airport).

Flat screen TV, a king bed, very comfortable and clean, well lit rooms, free wifi, air conditioning and very efficient front desk staff. I even needed to print out my boarding pass for an upcoming flight and the receptionist gladly offered to do it for me. Another good point is that it is not a big hotel.

Also, it is in what appeared to be mainly a business district, but there are plenty of bars and restaurants around which meant that it didn't feel in the middle of nowhere - and it is very close to the Bernabeu stadium too, which is good for football fans!

Our room was very clean and appeared quite new. The shower was extremely powerful..watch out!! The room had a small mini bar, but we used this to store our own bottled water and other drinks. The storage space was good and there was a safe in our wardrobe which was handy. There was flat screen t.v in the room but only one English channel and a sports channel which my boyfriend didn't mind watching as it had the Arsenal game on! This room was definately perfect for us. We were on a bed and breakfast package which was handy. The breakfast compromised of bread, cereal, hams, cheeses, cakes/croissants, omlettes, and some 'fry-up' food. The breakfast was adequate for us as we arent too fussy. 3 days of eating this was a bit overwhelming though! There are a few restaurants near the hotel but we went into the city each night to eat dinner...bear in mind that the Spanish do it quite late! The swimming pool area was very clean and is a real sun trap. There are plenty of loungers and umbrellas. The pool itself was pretty cold....most people braved it but i just dipped my feet in which was enough to cool me off. There is a lifeguard on duty and you are supposed to present a card to him which is given to you at reception.

The area surrounding the hotel is a mix of commercial offices and residential, so we found travelling into the city was easier for seeking food and refreshment.

The pool is shared with an apartment complex nearby and guests are limited to two hours a day, but that is usually sufficent. Not many people go to Madrid to lay by the pool! Take your own beach towel -- none are provided. It may also be helpful to know that there are three breakfast options: full buffet, American, and Continental. This was only explained when I asked.

After crossing the road, bear right and keep on the path left down Calle de Angelina de la Cruz, cross 2 roads and take the next left by the Kufxa. The hotel is on your right next to Fitness First. It takes about 10 minutes to walk from the Metro. Each metro journey costs E1 but you can buy 10 trips for E7 or a 3 day pass, which we wish we had bought as that would have been very economical. The Metro is clean and easy to use. If you want to see the centre of Madrid you need to get off at SOL.

I come from Sweden, am 27 years old and travelled alone. Partly chose the Amaral because of their resonably priced doublebed rooms for single person use. Generally speaking the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. All of them spoke good english (by spanish standards excellent english) and had a good knowledge about the area around the hotel as far as tips about restaurants and so went. The room was good, nothing stellar but what you would expect for the price range. All was very clean and tidy and the pool was nice, but a little cold. The hotel is located outside of the immediate city center and metro ride takes about 5-10 minutes depending on where in the center you are going to. Only a couple of minutes to the subway though so no problem there. Also unless you have tons of luggage take the metro to the hotel from the airport, works really easy, just one quick change and short distance from metro station Cuzco to Hotel. Metro from the airport is 2\u20ac, (yes that is two Euro) cab ride apparently costs around 30\u20ac... Also since the hotel is not in the super-center of the city but rather in a comercial/residential area (seemed middle-to upper middle class and safe) it is much more quiet than the center of the city. Before booking I noted many of the hotels in Madrid had bad comments for much noice in the night, this was no big problem at the Amaral. There were some guests (i assume) that were noisy and the walls are not that soundproof but I think it must have been much better than in the center. I had no problems sleeping at least, beds were a little to hard for my taste... I personaly wanted a quiet, not to expensive hotel for a stay were I visited the museums and sights of Madrid and not primarily to party. I was also very interested in the pool since Madrid in July is very hot (we had about 38 degrees C) and I wanted to be able to take a swim when I got home from a tiring day in the city and lay by the pool. The pool area was ok, but not that special, the pool is very cold (not heated) and was open between 11-21 on weekdays and 10-20 on weekends. It sounds generous but I was usually only able to use the pool for about an hour before it closed since I was in the city during day. It would have been nice to be able to take a morning swim or a nigtly swim around 22-23 but that is not possible as the pool area is closed then. Also I did not choose the buffet breakfast that was on offer, I never had it so can't really comment on taste, it didn't look worth the 13\u20ac a pop in my opinon though. There were alternatives with just coffey and toast at something like 5\u20ac but i had breakfast at caf\u00e9es in the city instead, also an excellent caf\u00e9 for breakfast just round the corner from the hotel. More ambiance as well as cheaper (2-5 \u20ac depending on what I ate, although no buff\u00e9 at that price). I would recomend the Amaral to all that want a quiet, reasonably high standard hotel at a resonable price. Specially if you would like the pool. If you are out to meet people and party all night long you may be better off in the city center but of course no problem to go into the city in the evening if you want to since there is the metro, cabs etc. Pool would I suppose make it a bonus for families with kids...", "Date": "July 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Helsinki, Finland", "Title": "\u201cSunotel amaral - good value for money\u201d", "Author": "Raksu", "ReviewID": "UR18006488", "Content": "Hotel was nice, staff also and there was even a parking hall for our rental car, which was a plus. 5-10 minute walk to nearby metro stations, 15 minutes to the city, not too bad in such a bif city.
