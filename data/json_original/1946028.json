Although there are some extras missing from the hotel- room phone/ room service and a safe, we found our stay to be well worth it. Staff went above and beyond to help us figure out a bus route as well as helped us at the bar. Breakfast is small but sufficient and inexpensive. 7.50 euro for breakfast and wireless internet in room.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Budapest, Hungary", "Title": "\u201cSimple, Affordable & Tidy...no Frills\u201d", "Author": "stevenekuhn", "ReviewID": "UR121616302", "Content": "This is my second stay at the Berlin one Hotel at this location. The rooms are small and very compact but also very organized and functional. The breakfast buffet is not bad and the coffee is pretty good. All in all the hotel is a nice one for a business trip for a few days but I would not suggest staying here for vacation. The reception is quickly overloaded due to there being almost only 1 person there and since this is a business hotel, groups come in at once, the receptionist will then ignore anyone not in the group. All in a a great location; 10 min walk from Potsdamer Platz, 5 min walk from Gendarmentmarkt, only minutes away from the hip Friedrichhain and Prenzlauer Berg. All the Best!", "Date": "December 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vienna, Austria", "Title": "\u201cNice, central and affordable\u201d", "Author": "ISW", "ReviewID": "UR118013060", "Content": "This hotel features the typical Motel One style - modern (quite minimalistic) interior and decor - and the location is very good for exploring much of Berlin by foot - about in the middle between Potsdamer Platz and Alexander Platz, with a 10-15 Minutes walk to the Brandenburger Tor. The room is designed in the way all Motel One rooms are - modern and functional. I found our double-room quite cozy, but it was really small - we found room to place one (closed) suitcase without tripping over it on our way to bed, but I have no idea where we would have put a second one... There is also not a lot of shelf space for two person's clothing for a few days, but we managed :-) Except for the fact that the bed had two mattresses (which results in the uncomfortable gap in the middle), we slept really well - make sure you have a room looking away from the Leipziger street is you want to keep your window open at night, otherwise it's definitely too loud. Breakfast was buffet-style with machines for making your own coffee (cappuccino, cafe latte etc). and was definitely worth the 7 extra Euros (especially since you get wifi in your room for free only when you book the breakfast, otherwise you pay 5 Euros per day). All in all: this Motel One is good value for the price :-)", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Warsaw, Poland", "Title": "\u201cFantastic hotel!
