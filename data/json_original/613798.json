First the positive: First class service, immuculate and spacious rooms, outstanding bathrooms, good restaurants, great views from the rooftop lounge, a quiet location and just a perfect place to spend a vacation. But....there are a few less-positive elements in this almost-perfect hotel. First is the layout of the hotel. Since the Molino Stucky is a converted factory it is composed of a number of buildings that have been linked somehow to make one facility. It is therefore a bit of a maze and takes some time to acclimate to the confusing corridors adn different elevators. Secondly is the case of the \"blessing in disguise\" location. The location while quite favorable because of it's quiet location is therefore not on the main island of Venice. This involves taking a boat (complimentary) each time you wish to walk through Venice. It can be a problem timing the departures and can sometimes be a long wait. The shuttle to Marco Leaves every hour and the shuttle to Zattere, every forty minutes. On occasion the shuttle that is coming from San Marco stops or skips Zattere because it is full or almost full. It's not fun waiting in inclement weather! The other option is to take the local vaporetto which can be an expense. All in all, I'd stay at the Molino Stucky anytime. because the good far outweighs the bad.", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cSomething different for a stay in Venice\u201d", "Author": "Aussie7leagueboots", "ReviewID": "UR127714593", "Content": "We have visited Venice many times over the years, usually staying in the middle of the hustle, bustle and noise of Venice. This visit we stayed at the Stucky. It certainly was a different experience. I travel frequently for work in the Asia Pacific area and use Hilton hotels a lot and so I thought using Hilton for a holiday stop in Italy would be interesting. Our room was clean, as quite as a tomb and the bed comfortable. The bathroom was very generously proportioned with a separate bath tub and shower. Alas, no face washers were provided. We tried to use the room phone but it wasn't working. Also there was no hotel information in the room nor was there a minibar price list. If your budget doesn't run to private transport, access to the hotel is either by Vaporetto ( Water bus) or by using the free hotel shuttle boat from either San Marco or Zattere which is the area facing the island on which the hotel is situated. Catching the shuttle from the Zattere stop can be problematical. It arrived from the San Marco stop already full several times during our stay meaning an extra 15 minute wait, making the total wait almost an hour. It's much better to use the San Marco stop and get there early. Breakfast was so so. As is often the case in hotels where the staff bring around coffee, after the first cup it's difficult to catch the attention of staff to get another one. Also the plates are tiny meaning they pile up on the table and aren't cleaned away during your breakfast. I made some toast only to find there was no margarine provided and only hard little blocks of butter which are impossible to spread. Newspapers either in Italian or English weren't provided in the breakfast room. Despite all these little quibbles, we enjoyed our stay at this hotel. It was a quite retreat from what was a very crowded Venice.

We stayed at the Hilton Molino Stucky because it is located off the main island of Venice, on the island of Guidecca. After arriving from the airport on our private water taxi from the airport (a 100 euro fare which was a HUGE thrill for our 7 year old), our adventure began. We were given a nice room on the 5th floor which faced the quiet courtyard (we used a hotel voucher using miles from AAdvantage so we didn't expect a canal view) and we were immediately given a roll-away bed for our young son without asking or reminding staff that we had a reservation for 3. We dropped off our suitcases, and headed out to the hotel pier to catch the shuttle boat over to San Marco Square for lunch and sightseeing (it was our 1st time in Venice). The trip is a short 10-15 minute boat ride which is complementary for Hilton guests which stops at Zattere and then at San Marco Square. http://www.molinostuckyhilton.com/shuttle.php The boat can get easily filled up with hotel guests on inbound or outbound boats (a shuttle can hold at most 40 people at one time), so make sure you are not late arriving or you will have to wait 45-60 minutes for the next complementary hotel shuttle. If you have the chance to purchase your room with the buffet breakfast (or upgrade your room to include the breakfast), it is a wonderful meal with a lot of different choices, both hot and cold, and well worth a visit each morning. Check-in and check-out went extremely smooth, with the help of very friendly staff. If you visit Venice and don't want to be in the center of \"tourist town\" in small rooms and hard to navigate streets and bridges with luggage, I would highly recommend the Hilton Molino Stucky.

But let's get the biggest issue out of the way: it is NOT on the main islands of Venice. The Hotel is located on Guidecce island, across from the other cluster of islands that make up most of Venice (about a 10 minute boat ride). The hotel does provide a free shuttle boat every twenty minutes to either of one or two locations (except for when they are on \"pause\" for an hour plus), but you have to make amends with this inconvenience. To be honest, despite our best planning, there were two nights when we found ourselves waiting up to 30 minutes on the dock for the shuttle in the rain [you can always take a public transport boat or private water taxi to get you near or to the hotel]. But if you can get by this inconvenience (and we found it wasn't that hard), the hotel is marvelous. From the interior architecture, much of this hotel was at one point a set of apartments. Our junior suite had a very spacious living room with fold out bed, a large bedroom with king bed, a functioning kitchenette (but no cookware) and a lovely bathroom with tub, shower and bidet. The decor was lovely and the maid service impeccable. For those with access to the \"executive club\", a good breakfast was provided (well-prepared, but never-changing menu). In addition, this area had beverages all day (including beer, wine and prosecco), a cocktail hour with hors d'oeuvres and snacks. The concierge was excellent, giving very clear directions and sound advice on questions ranging from the best way to get to Murano Island (he arranged for free transportation from one of the glass factories) to what we should wear to a Vivaldi concert (causal was fine) to making arrangements for private water taxi from/to hotel (110 euros). The hotel's general service was excellent, with prompt porter service, excellent bellmen (who on three occassions provided us with umbrellas before we knew we needed them) and an attentive front desk. Even Enrico at the bar remembered my nightcap drink after the first night and stood ready to serve me my \"usual\" from the second night onward. The hotel even had coffee, tea, orange juice and biscotti for travelers who had to leave the hotel before breakfast started. Was everything perfect? No. The internet rate was highway robbery at 25 euros a day. And again, the location was an inconvenience.

The hotel is a series of interconnected buildings. We stayed in the Foscari building, room number 545. ROOM: We found the room very large for Italian standards, as expected given a US hotel chain. We had a large king size bed, desk, 2 chairs (one for the desk), large night stands, a sitting table, and several lamps. The room was still rather dark when we had all the lights on in the room. There was a wardrobe with a safe in the separate entry hall, I liked having the entry hall as we could take off our shoes and coats before entering our room. The carpet seemed a bit warn and could use a cleaning or replacement. The bed was the most comfortable bed we used during our 11 day trip. It wasn't too hard or too soft - just right! All other beds in Italy we found VERY hard. There were beautiful wood beams - the underfloor of the floor above was exposed. It seemed to be typical of Venetian construction. The beams were beautiful. The windows opened which in March was very pleasant, although we did have several flies enter the room. There is signage asking guests not to open windows due to mosquito and flies. BATHROOM: full size bathroom with a bath tub, separate shower, bidet, toilet, and sink with a large counter. Toiletries provided were pleasant. As we found in all of Italy, we were only provided a hand towel and bath towel - no wash cloth. BREAKFAST: We decided to opt-in to the buffet breakfast offered by the hotel on Sunday for convenience. While good, I did not think it was worth 30 Euros. We were offered a discount for the buffet because my BF is a Hilton Rewards member and therefore we paid 30 Euros for both of us to enjoy the breakfast. The buffet had plenty of breads, meats, cheeses; a hot section of scrambled eggs, potatoes, sausage, and bacon; a nice selection of fruit and yogurt; as well as prosecco, coffee, tea, water, and juices (FYI - Sodas are 8 Euros and cost in addition to the buffet). Convenient and simple, but not worth the price. SERVICE: we only interfaced with staff when we checked in and I found it distasteful that the gentleman checking us in attempted to up sell us at every chance he had. Another couple was checking in at the same time. When the individual servicing us was not trying to sell something to us, I listened in to that conversation and gained SO much more information about the hotel and the facilities. SHUTTLE & LOCATION: The shuttle ran on time in March - note were were there several weeks before peak season begins. We had no difficulty finding a seat when catching the shuttle to either Zattere or San Marco. Note that it is a five minute trip to Zattere and there are 2 trips to Zattere each hour. There is only one boat to San Marco each hour. If you are willing to walk I highly recommend getting off at Zattere and walking to the more touristy sections (such as San Marco). We walked through Venice from Zatterre on Sunday and it was wonderful. We saw families strolling out and about, people walking their dogs, stumbled upon a grocery store and had a picnic lunch. It was wonderful to not be amongst all the shops and tourists (we tourists were still out and about just not in HUGE numbers when walking from Zatterre to other parts of Venice). I also highly recommend walking down the island of Giudecca - again it is not as touristy and we found a great little bakery very close to the public water bus (we took the water bus to the train station - the Stucky shuttle does not go to the airport or train station you have to take a water taxi at 100 Euros or the water bus. We took a water taxi at a cost of 120 Euros from the airport to the Stucky on arrival - it was a very pleasant, short ride to the hotel, but when you aren't in a hurry take the water bus and you'll see more of the islands). Explore, explore, explore! VALUE: I cannot really comment. We cashed in reward points to stay at the Stucky for little more than the tourist tax.

Prior to our trip I emailed the Hotel asking, if possible, for a room with a view and on arrival they offered us an amazing free upgrade to the 'Thats Amore' Suite which not only provided views over the water to Venice, but also had its own seperate living room area, 2 large flat screen tvs, a huge comfortable bed and a very well appointment bathroom (with a heavenly shower). It was a wonderful start to our trip and made our stay very memorable. The suite was located in the Arsenele part of the hotel (the hotel is so large they provide you with a map to get around) and it seemed to us to be one of the nicest wings. The hotel itself is exactly what we look for in a hotel - modern, yet retaining its unique features, clean and with excellent staff (who were incredibly helpful in making reservations for us at a restaurant). We sat in the lobby bar one afternoon to have a quick drink before heading out for the evening and a waiter bought over a selection of free cakes for us - which was a lovely touch. We also went for a jog around Guidecca Island early one morning which was a great alternative to the gym (which was a little small and hot!) - the views over to the main island of Venice were stunning. The shuttles which run over to Zattere and to St Marks Square were reliable and always on time, however we did find the timetable a bit infrequent on occasions (I assume this is because we travelled off peak) but the hotel itself does make the incovenience of taking the shuttles worthwhile. I would 100% recommend this hotel to anyone who visits Venice - we will hopefully return one day in the future.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, Russia", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay\u201d", "Author": "Natasha B", "ReviewID": "UR126948215", "Content": "Spent there only one night but it was so great we ll definately repeat it.

Constructed in partnership between the city of Venice and Hilton in 2007, the hotel was created in the shell of a 19th century brick flour factory after a five-year renovation project that is considered one of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finest historic reuse projects. We were extremely impressed at the level of construction detail that we observed throughout the property, noting that Hilton spared no expense in using the finest woods, marbles and metal finishes throughout the sprawling complex. While the hotel lacks the historic charm and patina of the Gritti Palace, Europa, or the Danieli, its imposing setting, modern elegance, and interesting spaces more than make up for the ambiance to found in the hotels around the Grand Canal. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location away from the chaos and crowds at the center of Venice may be its greatest attribute. Located on Giudecca Island, the hotel provides quick, frequent and complimentary shuttle service to Zattere and San Marco. Book a room with a view of the main islands if you can, but if you find yourself on the other side of the hotel don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t despair. Just head up to the 8th floor skybar after dark to sip some prosecco and to enjoy the view of lighted buildings along the lagoon. We found all of the hotel staff extremely professional and friendly, and willing to go out of the way to be helpful. The staff in the lobby bar was particularly congenial. The only staff shortcoming that we noticed were with those employees who answered phone calls that we placed from our room to obtain hotel information. You cannot dial the front desk from your room phone, but rather you must push a phone button labeled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Magic,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which is not exactly what we experienced. Some staff on the other end of the button gave us either the wrong information or possessed poor English speaking skills, compared to the staff working in public areas. (Not a problem if you speak Italian, of course) Oh yes, during our March stay the hotel had a concierge on duty only on the weekends, which made getting information difficult since we had to wait in line for some time at the front desk as only two staff were ever on duty to handle the guests for the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 379 rooms. There was plenty of suited staff with gold nametags moving about the hotel, but far too few working the front desk. Upon check-in we were upgraded to a king suite that was terrific! All of the room furnishings were of very high quality, and the bed was exceptionally comfortable, more so than any Hilton property where we have ever stayed, including its Waldorf Astoria collection. And the bath was very large, with separate tub and shower. It was interesting to note the high level of craftsmanship evident in the bathroom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s marble floor and wall tiles. Overall, our king suite occupied the same space as two deluxe king bedrooms. But light sleepers or those who retire early would be advised to avoid staying on the 7th floor in the wing that houses the rooftop bar and restaurant. Our room turned out to be right under the 8th floor restaurant and bar. We were kept awake until 1:30 AM one morning by the sound of tables, chairs and furniture being dragged across the floor over our heads, presumably by the cleaning crew. And since our room was at the end of the hallway, we found that 8th floor staff were constantly bringing kitchen and restaurant gear \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including dirty dishes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to the 7th floor landing just outside our door, and then leaving the double-doors at the end of the hallway wide open. Whenever I closed them to seal of the noise, someone would soon prop them open again. When we complained the next morning, the desk staff graciously offered to move us to a lower floor. And interior rooms, adjacent to or opposite the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s several restaurants, should be avoided as well since the sounds of trash transfer, deliveries, and employees on break can echo loudly within the brick interior spaces of the hotel complex. We found the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employees who worked in these areas to be rather loud late at night and early in the morning. So be sure to check on the location of your room if you are sensitive to noise. Our lovely room did come with a few frustrating complications. It was always overly warm even when evening temperatures dropped to the 40\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. The room thermostat had no cooling feature, no numbered degree settings, and a non-functioning fan. And then the oddest thing occurred on our second night. The television turned on by itself with a loud, irritating beeping noise. We went into the bedroom to investigate we found a message from the hotel desk on the screen, inviting us to the happy hour on the rooftop bar. The obnoxious beeping continued until we turned the television off. While we appreciated the personal invitation, we found the method of delivery rather unnerving. Should a hotel have the ability to turn on a guest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s television? We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think so. We then wondered what else the hotel could do with that television. Another frustration was there was no room information on how or where to get ice. It turned out there was no ice machine in the 7th floor, although our \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Magic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd button promised one. The closest machine turned out to be on the 5th floor, but in a different wing of the hotel. But I only discovered this after asking an employee who I found polishing a wood door in the hallway. He left his post to lead me down two floors and into the wing with the ice machine. But on this initial trip, and each one that followed, the ice machine was out of order. So was the machine on the 4th floor that was shown to me as a backup. I was eventually forced to call room service for ice. They were very quick, but the cost each time was a one Euro tip. One more thing. We were required to obtain a new internet password every day. Although the cost of internet service was included in our room fee for the length of our stay, every evening I had to place a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Magic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd phone call to obtain a new user name and password. This process is automated in most Hilton hotels, so we found this manual routine rather odd. We enjoyed drinks and appetizers in the lobby bar on two nights, before we headed into the center of Venice for dinner, and then had a nightcap at the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rooftop terrace bar when we returned. The rooftop restaurant and bar are not to be missed, or the rooftop swimming pool that was closed in March. But we noticed that the three restaurants and bars in the hotel that we frequented had different prices for the very same prosecco. Even the staff could not explain this fact when asked. Hilton members with Diamond status, or those who can afford it, should consider booking an executive room to secure all-day access to the executive lounge that offers food and drinks, from breakfast until late in the evening. Food is available all day, and wine, refrigerated beers and prosecco are on hand as soon as breakfast is cleared. Guests could easily eat two meals a day here, and then splurge on dinner at fine restaurant in the main section of Venice. But the executive lounge is oddly situated on an open, elevated side of the lobby bar requiring key-card \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd entry. This gated process must seem rather unwelcoming to non-executive guests sitting in the lobby bar area. The placement of the lounge was most certainly a design after-thought. Not only does it appear oddly situated, but the setting does not feel \u00e2\u20ac\u0153executive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or privileged in the least, but instead appears placed where it is for the convenience of food service delivery and clean-up. Management needs to rethink this one. And it also needs to consider a soft goods renovation of the furniture in the public since the furniture is looking rather worn. Overall our experience at the Molino Stucky was much better than we expected, and we would surely stay there again, admittedly keeping in mind the cautions that we have noted here. The hotel management tries very hard to please its guests and provides several means to evaluate the quality of your stay, but there numerous details that need attention. We understand that some of the quirks that we experienced are uniquely Italian, or perhaps simply Venetian, yet they were numerous and problematic enough to deserve mentioning to prospective guests.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWeekend in Venice\u201d", "Author": "L H", "ReviewID": "UR126672994", "Content": "On arrival the hotel seemed lovely.

Roma and the locals were very helpful in directing us. The trip from Zattare to the hotel is very short (and, incidentally, the walk from Zattare to St Mark's is easily done in 10 mins so don't feel you need to wait for a shuttle to St Mark's). Bear in mind the morning rush to get to town so make sure you are at the shuttle a good 15 minutes before it leaves if you want to get on it in peak times. With regard to the room (standard room booked), I must confess to doing a little jig when we checked in and it had a view of the lagoon (thank you!). It was a lovely room as well and my only gripe is with the TV having virtually no English channels and really expensive pay per view movies (old or new). The hotel staff were all very pleasant and friendly - I must particularly mention the housekeeping staff and the waiting staff at breakfast. Also, the concierge kindly managed to re-arrange a tour we had missed (as the boat was full - see above) without too much fuss. In the same breath I must thank the manager for his birthday card and Hilton $'s (which I have kept as a souvenir!). It was very kind of you to remember my birthday. The breakfast spread is very good, although I wouldn't pay full price for it. On the subject of food, the prices are extortionate. We are talking 28 Euro for a cheeseburger and fries in your room, plus a delivery fee (for room service) of 8 Euro and 6 Euro for a bottle of water! So essentially your burger, fries and a water is costing you 42 Euro. For one. To eat in the restaurants you get charged a cover charge per person and service fee as well, which I find a bit of a slap in the face. Unfortunately these prices meant that instead of supporting the hotel establishments as we would usually do, we rather ate in town (where some restaurants do the same, but there are many that do not). The spa seems comprehensive, although we did not make use of it, and the gym is basic. I couldn't find an indoor swimming pool (?), which I found a bit odd for a 5* hotel.

It was efficient, inexpensive and offered a nice introduction to Venice. The exterior of the hotel reflects its former life as a flour mill while the inside has been nicely redone with a modern, spacious lobby and several restaurants.

The hotel itself is huge, very well appointed and clean. Rooms spacious and comfortable, although I hope (for the rest of you) that not all rooms have a toilet for the handicapped like ours did. It's ideal if you need such a facility but when you don't, it's an uncomfortably high perch... Initially we were a bit disappointed to find that, despite specifically booking a Kingsize Deluxe Plus room (the Plus bit means a view of the water), we were given a twin. They changed it, but a little apology for their mistake would have been nice. We ate in the main Rialto bar - good but very expensive. The Skyline Roof bar is nice (but the Roof pool is closed until May). We also followed signs and eventually found the Spa - but I think the healthy exercise aspect is travelling the mile of corridors, stairs and lift to find it. If travelling from Marco Polo airport, the most direct is the Allilaguna (or something) B boat, which stops right outside. If you want to visit Murano (for the glass etc), be aware that if the hotel suggests a free complimentary taxi boat, it's a nice ride in a classy boat but it delivers you to a glassworks with the mandatory visit of their gallery and a clear expectation that you part with large amounts of money to purchase a piece of glassware (mostly upwards of 5000 Euros). The marked prices are at least 4 times what you should pay, and even if you limit yourself to the small tourist-type necklaces to appease your conscience, you will pay 25 Euros for something which costs 6 Euros in all the souvenir shops.

We were staying for Valentine's night so really wanted the hotel to live up to our expectations as it looked stunning from the pictures I had seen online. The instructions for arrival by car to the hotel given on the Hilton website were accurate and very helpful. We arrived from Tronchetto parking and took the vaporetto to Zattere and then the free shuttle to the Hilton jetty. All ran smoothly. Upon arrival the concierge and FOH staff were professional and efficient. Our room was stunning, spacious and in trend with the style of Venice. Lovely, quality robes and slippers in the room which I think is a nice touch. I loved the separate dressing room area and somewhere to store the luggage other than in the main bedroom. We spent the afternoon relaxing and having some drinks in the bar. The service was fantastic and the bar area roomy and relaxing. We sat at the bar with a fine bottle of Bisol Prosecco and a very welcoming bar man who happened to be practicing his cocktail mixing techniques and offered us a free cocktail to taste his new creation! What a treat! We were eating out the hotel for dinner as we had prebooked but we did notice that the Valentines menu was \u00e2\u201a\u00ac120.00 each which we thought was very pricey.The concierge service was exceptional - the lady told me straight off how to get to the other side of Venice for our restaurant booking, what water bus to catch and all the times, very impressed. Skyline Bar was intimate and romantic but didn't get to see the great views as it was dark (and very cold!!). Cocktails were strong (a little bit too intense) and for one Mojito and one Mai Tai cost nearly \u00e2\u201a\u00ac30.00! I thought the free shuttle service to San Marco square and to Zattere was an excellent service, it really helped to explore the main city of Venice with ease. Maybe running a later shuttle than 12 midnight may have been an idea, until 1am would have been useful. We opted out of breakfast as this was going to be \u00e2\u201a\u00ac30.00 for the two of us and thought this was rather excessive ...... would rather grab a cappucino and croissant in a little cafe somewhere.On departure we also were give a discount voucher to save money on the parking at Tronchetto - this was a good deduction and saved us about \u00e2\u201a\u00ac12.00. Overall a beautiful hotel which oooooozzzeeed luxury, style whilst keeping traditional features in place.

Giudeca is right in front of Zattere and St. Marks and the hotel offers a convenient free shuttle service to both islands every 20 minutes, not a minute late, it takes 5 mins to Zattere and 10 to St. Marks. We also took the vaporetto to get to Lido, there are vaporetto stations everywhere. We had a suite and a double room (connecting since we had the kids, rooms # 608-609) on the sixth floor, very spacious and beautiful decorated with murano chandeliers, classy with a rustic feeling. In total we had 2.5 bath and plenty of closets and sitting area. Breakfast was inlcuded and it was plenty of fruits, meats, cereals, yogurts, juices and different rolls. I would like to mention and give credit to Fabrizzio who went out of his way to help me fight a really bad cold bringing me hot water, lemon and honey to help me with my voice, the restaurant staff was very attentive and friendly.The views over the Grand Canal are amazing, you wake up in the morning and look outside your window and its like a post card, the sun shinning and to see the golden color over the city is overwhelming. Don't miss Signoretti the Murano Glass factory. They offer a free taxi to the island of Murano to visit a blow-glass factory. The place itself is a museum.

It was soo good, I decided to return. Unusual because my preference would normally be to try somewhere else. However, I'm glad we did. Upon our return we were blown away. This is unlike other hotels. Arriving by boat is a unique and fun experience. Travelling across to St Marks by the hotel water shuttle iseems like the best way to arrive in the heart of the city.

This was a consistent theme throughout our stay; the management clearly spends a lot of time selecting and training their staff. From reception to waitors to housekeepers, they were all superbly attentive and made us extremely welcome. They genuinely seemed delighted we were the there.

Only the beauty of maginificent Venice could make us leave. This is truly one of the world's most fascinating and romantic cities; terrific to walk around. The one night we ate dinner at the hotel, we were really surprised. The hotel is a huge imposing edifice (a former flour factory) with bumndles of character. Its corridors are unique and there are loads of nooks and crannies. However, I thought the restaurant might lack character. The opposite was true. Somehow they managed to create a small intimate and atmpospheric restaurant in the middle of this magnificent hotel. The food and wine were delicious perfect. It felt like we were in a restaurant hidden away in a small town nobody knows. I can't remember the name but I heartily recommend it. As a contrast, the Skyline bar was trendy and fashionable. Great place place to visit and a fun contrast. Drinks were well made and we enjoyed relaxing there at the end of every day. Without hesitation, I can fully recommend this hotel.

Carnivale in Venice, and a 10 night stay at the Molino Stucky. It should have been perfect, but there is always more to the story. To be fair, it was probably the busiest time of the year for the staff of the Hilton, and they seemed to put forth a proportional effort, but sometimes that effort seemed to go nowhere. It started a little rocky when trying to arrange a shared taxi from the airport through their concierge.... you can only arrange this 24 hours in advance of arrival, and flying from the west coast it meant we were in transit at this 24 hour mark. Good luck getting through to the concierge at Carnivale time.... any clue how frustrating it is waiting on automated hold on a cellphone in an airport and then being cut off 15 minutes later... twice? So we have a back-up plan, send an e-mail with our names, flight number, arrival time and a request for the service, and then check for a response at the next stop on our journey. This should work, right?... Wrong, the response says \"find our contact information you need below\".... and includes their phone number.... ARRGGGHHH. So we get to Venice 28 hours later (a delay in Paris, and lost luggage in Venice) and find that we have no hotel taxi, but we can hire a private taxi at 120 euros plus luggage fee.... Its Carnivale after all. So what do we do?, what any stupid Americans would do.... we go Alilaguna, because who wants to pay for the private taxi. A LONG two hours later we arrive at the Molino Stucky after seeing every Venice stop on the Blue Line enroute. The hotel is beautiful, the front desk help are so understanding of our frayed and tired attitude, and the bellman Roman is an absolute delight in getting us settled in. The room is on the Giudecca wing facing an interior courtyard.... not as fancy as the room pictures on the website show, but it is comfortable and at this point anything with a bed and a shower will do. We go downstairs to find that on Giudecca on a Sunday evening, in the winter, probably none of the 4 restaurants are open (yes only 4, the rest are osterias which means drinks or finger food).... OK, we will do one of the Hiltons restaurants. We head to Bacaromi, because its too early for the Aromi, and we have an AMAZING selection of tapas, a fried selection of shrimp, squid, and octopus (their version of fish and chips), and a half carafe of wine. It was wonderful, reasonably priced (70 euro plus tip), and the bartender who took care of us was great. So things are looking up, and now its time to recoup from our long day and half getting here. At 3 A.M., the alarm clock goes off, because it says its 8:30 and the last traveler was kind enough to leave the alarm set. Finally get the stupid thing turned off and awaken at 9:00, ready for coffee and new adventures.... coffee is instant Nescafe (GROSS...) and we missed the shuttle to the main island by 5 minutes. We find Roman, and he kindly tells us where we can find a small grocery store on Giudecca (the Coop, pronounced Copa), and we fall in love with the fresh selection of fruit, bread, cheeses, and ham.... back to the room with our bounty and a little food to perk us up. We finally meet up with our concierge, and he kindly sets us up with a little sightseeing and party reservations that we asked for. We do Venice that day, and then a little bar-hopping that evening in costume.... It is all so Venice!! Back to the room where the bed has been turned down and little candies on the pillows, (leaving that 2 euro coin under the pillow works) try to set the clock and make sure the alarm is off but unable to make the clock work, so we use the cellphone as a back-up. Alarm clock goes off at 5:30 A.M. although it says 11:28 (I swear it's possessed), so we get up a couple of hours later and do our morning routine.... instant coffee (getting a little used to it), go to the Coop and pick up breakfast stuff, and miss the shuttle by 5 minutes. My wife does the spa for a couple of hours where she is foot molested in the jacuzzi by some letch from Lido who is hitting on her relentlessly, but otherwise states it is a beautiful facility. We do more sightseeing (the crowds are getting heavier) and shopping for gifts to take home to the family. We always seem to hit the shuttle when its going to Zattere, not San Marco (there is a rotating pattern), so we find ourselves walking through Dorsoduro and over the Accademia or Rialto bridge to get to San Marco. Restaurants are a trip... they charge you for bread and water, coperto, (a cover charge) if you set at a table, although they may not provide it to you. Water is always bottled and cost more than beer or wine (so we drank a LOT of wine) and the food is expensive.... sometimes really good, and sometimes not. Pizza is everywhere, but its not like we are used to in the US. We did find a place called a rosticceria, that grills a lot of different foods (vegetables, meat, etc) and it offers it up buffet style... good quality, fair pricing, no coperto, and always open when we came by. That is also a problem that requires planning.... restaurants seemed to close at 7 or 8 P.M., and were also closed for a 2 or 3 break mid-afternoon. Do try the Devils Forest Pub.... great atmosphere and drink, OK food, and free Internet (which cost 28 euro a DAY at the hotel). We did the Murano, Burano, Torcello excursion.... it was a RIP-OFF. The trip only gives you 30 minute stop on Murano at one glass factory for a quick demo and then a trip to their showroom.... then back on the boat (what about the other factories, the glass museum, and a bite to eat?). The stop at Torcello was 50 minutes, and it only has a church, two restaurants (both closed), and a couple of snack bars and tables set up flea market style with the same tourist goodies you find at San Marco. Oh yeah, it cost 1,50 euro each to pee here.... back on the boat and off to Burano. This was the neatest stop of all because it seemed like an actual community with shops, restaurants, and real people (kids dressed up for Carnivale), so we ditched the tour group, bought gifts, had a meal (best fish of the entire trip) and then caught the ACTV boat back to Cannaregio. We found out that we could have bought a regular Blue Line ticket for 15 euro each, and gone to the same islands on our own schedule, without paying for the tour. The concierge did tell us that they can arrange for a private taxi to take us from the hotel to Murano, but the charge would be covered by the factory where we made our purchase.... sounds iffy to me, because the factory rep at our first stop stated the Hilton covered it as a comp to their guests. Now the hard part.... the weekend leading up to Shrove Tuesday. It was PACKED with people, not just on the main island, but everywhere. The hotel announced a new shuttle schedule in order to cope with demand, but it seemed to only add a few more time slots in the evening (but not during their one hour break around 9:00 P.M.). Now, with the approximately 350 rooms and all of the guest's trying to get to San Marco on a 40 person shuttle every half hour, you can see where this equation becomes problematic. After a while, the crowds are so fearful of not making the shuttle and having to wait a half hour, that they just crowd onto the ramp and the launch like hysterical cattle! More than once we were bumped off the boat, and the next shuttle that arrived was only going to Zattere, so we did our long walk again over the bridges to San Marco. Oh yeah.... The alarm clock.... we spoke with the maids a couple of times, asking them if they could set the right time on it (I swear, there was no way to do it), and after a couple of attempts at it, they just unplugged it and turned it toward the wall so you couldn't see the display. OK.... So am I totally down on the Hilton? NO, it was just Carnivale, and what could they do? If I return, I would stay on the main island.... the shuttles only run from 9 to midnight at half hour intervals, and we always seemed to end up in Zattere.... it would be nice to just walk out of our hotel and get something to eat without worrying about what time it was or which stop we had to go to. I would go back and have dinner at the Hilton, and would definitely go to the pool bar (which was closed for winter, so we couldn't get access to the views). Otherwise Giudecca is best used as a respite from the crush and crowds of Venice. Venice itself?, well its old, has a LOT of old master style of art (but you wait a long time in line to see it), and once you figure out where your going, its quite a trip. Getting lost in Venice is part of the fun (don't trust the Per San Marco signs, they LIE), eating food you can't readily pronounce or identify is an adventure, and seeing everyone do the costume dress-up like little kids at Halloween is a blast.

Nothing - zero - use the floor, or forget it. The rooms are small (at least ours was) but a folding stand would have really helped. Room Service might as well shut down at 11 PM (actually more like 10:45). We arrived late and unless you wanted a desert or a bowl of vegetable soup, there is nothing to eat. Not even a cold sandwitch is available. This was really annoying.Don't expect sympathy from the staff, just an explanation of the rules. You do get a nice view from the Canal side rooms, but the location, needing to take a boat to get to San Margo and the Grand Canal, really isn't ideal. Getting there initially is also somewhat of a hassle. Actually getting to any hotel in Venice is, it is part of the charm and the unique experience of your visit to Venice. It is just that they just don't make any effort to make it easier. We drove from Florence. Over the phone they explained where to park, but from that point on you are pretty much on your own. \"Take the number 2 (no explanation of where to get it and it sure isn't obvious) to either the third stop or the fourth. If you get off at the third stop get on our boat (finding that is a challange in itself) or if you get off at the fourth stop walk over two bridges to the hotel.\" I suspect in the daytime this is all very easy. But a late at night there is not a soul around either at the parking garage or either of the boat landings to ask directions from and signage is practically non-existant. By your second day all of this is second nature, but I can't imagine why they don't email out some directions prior to your arrival. You will evenutally get there just fine. It is a little surprising that you won't see a bellman until you are inside and if arriving late like we did, not even then. We had to get all our luggage to our room with no assistance at all. You arrive on their boat but no one meets it to take their luggage? Maybe at a Hilton Garden that's expected, but shouldn't be that way at a Hilton. I know this sounds like I am really upset and dissapointed about our stay here. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Venice. It is a beautiful hotel with great views and from what I sampled very good food. It wouldn't take much at all to make it much better - the small things do matter at these prices. There are many things to really like about this Hotel, The views, the decor, the food, but the minor annoyances just keep me from gong to that 5th star.

Last year, we were reticent about staying at the Hilton because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on Giudecca Island about 300 m from Venice proper and the only transport is by boat.

There are several excellent restaurants near the hotel along the Giudecca water front. The hotel is massive; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a converted mill withlots of wooden beams and cast-iron pillars.

The Molino Stucky has genuine character. Because we are Hilton Honor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guests and the hotel wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t packed (February is the quiet season), we were upgraded. Our room is quite fabulous and we have a view across the water to Venice, which is probably the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most beautiful city. I asked for a quiet room and I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t heard a sound since I got here. It takes three things to make a great vacation: location, hotel, and staff. Venice can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be beaten if you are photographers who like architecture as much as we do. The location of the hotel is excellent. The staff we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve met in the restaurant and lounge couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be better; we very much enjoy chatting to them because they are remarkably open and friendly (not like those in some hotels who turn a smile on and off as they pass you). Because our breakfast is included, we eat in the dining room where the buffet is very diverse. Typical breakfast buffets in other hotels often include a limited range of poor quality cheeses and cold meats. Here the cheeses and meats are first class (I love their soft cheeses like Gorgonzola) . There is also a remarkable range of cakes and pastries that are to die for \u00e2\u20ac\u201c unfortunately as a diabetic they are a temptation that I have to resist. The only thing missing are salad vegetables such as tomatoes and olives. This is a hotel we love and, like Arnie, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd If you are interested in viewing our Venice images, they are at www.pbase.com/clements", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bracknell, England, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cThe very best\u201d", "Author": "Chris O", "ReviewID": "UR124756409", "Content": "This Hilton is at the very top of the Hilton standards, the staff are helpful, attentive and genuinely caring, the building itself is a real inspiration and the restaurants serve very good food options.

The professional staff take great care to welcome you with Venetian hospitality. And our little 2-year old girl always got attention! Breakfast consisted of a wonderful layout of European meats, breads, cheeses and the freshest fruit anywhere. Our room was spacious by American standards with high ceilings and a large bathroom with a separate shower and tub. We did notice the room felt a little damp, but we attribute that to Venice. MY TIPS: If you have the time, explore La Giudecca! There are gorgeous churches, a little co-op store and a handful of nice waterfront restaurants with stunning views of Venice. If you're travelling with young children, forget the stroller and invest in a good Deuter backpack for hauling your bambino or bambina.

The Molino Stuckey Hilton surpasses these standards but has a few foibles the discerning traveller should consider. There are advantages to being located on Giudecca island, away from main hustle and bustle and with impressive views over the Guidecca Canal onto Venice central. However, with little to do, or places to eat on the island (in November) you are dependent on either the free hotel water taxi or local water bus to get to and from the centre. We had no problems with either service, but did see some services were cancelled due to fog (in November). It only takes 5 minutes to get from the hotel across the canal to Zattere, or about 10 minutes to get to St Marco. So consider your itinerary carefully to enjoy the quiet of Giudecca and the activities across the canal. [We did discover a nice local restaurant called Osteria ae Botti about a five minute walk from the hotel opposite the water bus stop Palanca.] The hotel is a lovely building having been converted and refurbished from a flour mill in 2007. The complex is actually a collection of inter-connected buildings with names conveniently beginning with A to G. The highlights are the Skyline bar and roof terrace with 360 degree views of Venice - which is fine in summer, but lost when dark and foggy (in November). We were very pleased with our room in Biennale (block B) overlooking the canal and done out to a very high standard UNTIL we started to hear every word and bodily function from the adjoining room. Seriously, this is a MAJOR ISSUE in these rooms. We asked to be moved, which the hotel did straight away - but it was a pain to re-pack and un-pack. So definitely check if you're getting an adjoining room and if so get a guarantee that you won't have neighbours! The hotel is also a major venue for business conferences, and whilst there were none there at the time of our visit one could imagine the addition noise and pressure on services. Not the cheapest place to stay but one that will appeal to the discerning traveller.

I think it was approximately a 45 minute boat ride with 5-7 stops before we arrived at the Hilton. This was about the last thing I wanted to do after a long flight and the time change, but the price was too good to pass up.

The taxi ride was quite beautiful as we were able to take in the many sites of Venice via water. It was amazing and my first taste of Europe. I enjoyed it very much. We were dropped off at the Hilton which is across the waterway from the main part of Venice. We checked into the hotel and took the elevator to our room on the 5th floor. The hotel room was gorgeous. It was clean and very well appointed. It was very spacious with a comfortable King bed. The windows in the room overlooked a side canal. We then took the elevator to the rooftop pool.

Most of the time, we provide very positive reviews. The Molino Stucky though left us very pleased with two staff in particular, but VERY disappointed in the rooms! Lets start with the positive: The front desk clerk, Rita, checked us in. She was friendly, very pleasant, and helpful! To our amazement, she remembered our names throughout the four nights that we spent at the hotel. A very nice touch! Other positives include the fact that this is a newer hotel, so the public areas are clean, well planed out, nicely furnished, and not showing signs of wear. The fact that they were able to maintain the integrity of the exterior of the building was also nice. I'm afraid this is where my complements change to an honest account of some serious problems. After check-in, we went to our room after an exhausting journey to Venice. This is where the problems began. I've attached pictures, as I suspect some folks might not believe what I'm about to share. Upon entering the room, we noticed a number of serious flaws: 1. The carpet was disgustingly dirty! This is the first hotel we've ever stayed in where we made certain to use the slippers provided, for fear of walking bare-foot on the floor. 2. There was a large, thick wad of hair on the floor. That same thick wad remained in our room the ENTIRE FOUR NIGHTS we were there (pictures were taken on the third night). 3. There were droplets of blood on the left side of the bed sheets. 4. There is NO sheet between the comforter and the fitted sheet. This is very unsanitary, as you're covering yourself with the same comforter as EVERY OTHER PERSON WHO SLEPT IN YOUR BED before you! And once again, this was the way it was every single night! 5. The curtains were coming off of the rod on each end. 6. The inlaid twisted glass in the mirror was broken out. (this was not a big deal per se, but when taken in light of all the other issues, it was still noticeable). So when time permitted later after check in, we went to request a different room. We were taken by one of the bellman (who had the personality of a dead fish!) to look at another room. While everything else was in good working order in that room, the carpet in it was in even worse shape than the one we had! At this point, given how tired we were and not wanting to raise a bigger fuss, we just decided to tolerate what we had and stayed in the room we were already in. Food in Venice is over-priced to begin with (they have to ship everything in). We expected that. But the food prices in the hotel lounge are significantly jacked up from even those prices. In the hotels defense, the US dollar is worth far less than the Euro, so things are going to be more expensive for US folks. But even factoring that in, prices were grossly inflated here. A walk down the sidewalk from the hotel will take you to a few dining options on Giudecca that are more reasonable and better quality. As a Hilton Honors member, and having saved points for years for my dream vacation to Venice, I was extremely disappointed that this was what I got for my years of loyalty! Rita at the front desk (and a female staff member who worked both at the breakfast buffet as well as the lounge (she resembled the female concierge) were both very kind, welcoming, and a great addition to the staff there. But I'm afraid the rest of the experience was a bit of a let-down. We knew we'd be taking a shuttle boat to/from Venice (which we enjoyed the solitude of getting away from the crowds). We just weren't expecting a hotel of this caliber in a world-class city to be this new and yet so worn in its bedrooms.

For Hilton Honours members the current Executive Lounge area is just a fenced off part of the ground floor restaurant....it didn't feel special and it wasn't and no facilities or staffing that you would noramally get.....maybe this is temporary I don't know. Pool area is good on the roof with sensational views but no proper policing of the limited number of loungers many of hich were 'occupied' all day by a towel and a book and nothing and nobody else.....the hotel could just deal with these selfish guests by throwing their kit over the wall after half an hour of abandoning the loungers if they wanted to make it fair for everyone. The room I had was great both large and well furnished but try to avaoid rooms just looking down on where the Hilton ferry boat arrives and departs as the dock makes a lot of noise bouncing up and down all night long even on the 5th floor. Management need to get a grip on some of their staff...this is meant to be the HOSPITALITY industry....if there were more Italian staff I think it would be a lot better but too many East Europeans polite but cold. Finally the Concierge showed the most wonderful and moving behaviour to a handicapped guest I have seen anywhere...some of the other hotel employees could learn a lot from him!", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia, United States", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel in Venice!\u201d", "Author": "Nydia B", "ReviewID": "UR120336833", "Content": "We stayed here only one night at the beginning of November.

Hotel upgraded us to a suite. Bedroom had doors closing it off from the sitting area, where a separate bed was brought in. Son thought that bed not comfortable, so, guess what, mother spent next four nights there. It was fine. I slept fine. Son shared king-size bed with father. OK with me, as, when I can't sleep, I like to turn on lights and read. As to room, it really was roomy. Bathroom had separate tub and shower. Roomy, deep tub is wonderful for working out kinks after a long day of walking, wandering streets of Venice. Water was hot, pressure was good, amenities were nice. As spouse is Hilton Diamond, we had access to Executive Lounge. This is important, as food in Venice is pricey, and not always that good. (An Italian we met in Lake Como some years ago told us that Venetians do not often eat out, and so restos cater mainly to tourists - not repeat customers, usually - and so, have little reason to worry about actually providing great food.) Back to Molino Stuckey: this hotel can be crowded, and expensive, when cruise ship people are doing a pre- or post- cruise extension. Also, hotel seems to do a big business in business conferences. Lots of 'suits.' That said, food in executive lounge generally good, some night better than others for evening snacks. Breakfast was wonderful: son has become fan of prosciutto. The cheese is wonderful. However, on more than one occasion, I think the coffee served in the urns was INSTANT!!! The only other small quibble: on the day we arrived, we requested a second luggage rack (as there were three of us, this does not seem a big deal.) An officious bellhop told us, \"There is only one to a room. We don't have extras.\" However, a lovely, helpful member of housekeeping, who came to make up the extra bed, brought not only extra towels, soap, etc, but also, one more luggage rack. Be aware, there are no iron or ironing boards in rooms. If you request them, they will be provided, but you are told to call for them to be picked up. This was fine with us. Complementary boat service, by alilaguna, was fine, going to either Zattere (accent on first syllable), which is short walk to Accademia, or San Marco and the crowds. We spent several evenings in Executive Lounge, relaxing, and couldn't help but notice that Americans, even when not having had much to drink, seem to speak as if they, and their listeners, were hard of hearing. On more than one occasion, spouse warned me not to accost loud guests to pipe down. I was tempted. Other than that hotel is wonderful.

It is not on the \"main\" island of Venice. You'll need to be flexible with having to wait for the shuttle boat to to the island and back.

This hotel is well positioned to see Venice and is on the water but it is not in the middle of everything, if we were to go back to Venice we would probably stay at the Boscolo Dei Dogi Venice which is also out of the way but has a beautiful garden and a more Italian feel. The biggest drawback was the water shuttle, we knew that we would have to take the shuttle to get to Venice every day but did not realize the amount of time we would be waiting for shuttles and going back and forth between the hotel and San Marco, after a few days we had a good handle on the schedule but valuable time in Venice was wasted. Our room was a canal view room and the view was amazing and the first two nights were incredible.

However, if you like to stay off the beaten path and like to get a feel for how locals live, this is a great place to stay. First: location. As others have noted, this hotel is across the lagoon from the main city of Venice. We came in by train and had no problems taking a vaporetto - even with quite a few suitcases in tow. The vaporetto stop is Palanca and it lets you off a short distance from the hotel. So, again, no problems hauling the luggage. Once at the hotel, you can take their water shuttle, which goes in a triangle between Guidecca, Zattere and San Marco. We didn't mind having to wait for a shuttle, but if you don't like to be inconvenienced by scheduling your outings around public transportation, you'll want to consider an option right in the city. On Guidecca itself, there are a handful of restaurants and shops, so we liked being able to stick close to the hotel if we wanted. There was a very nice shop that sold Venetian masks that we liked and also a great convenience store that had water, snacks and even sold a pasta of the day. Now for the room. We got the Family Suite and it was fabulous. It was super spacious and had a little kitchenette so we could store waters and fix small snacks in our room. The room had one full bathroom with a separate shower and tub, sink and toilet and then a half bath with just a sink and toilet. The only oddity was that the bedroom had no door. It was open to the living room, which means there wasn't a lot of privacy. The free breakfast was fine. There was plenty of room in the buffet room where the food was laid out and plenty of tables to sit down.

Saturday morning when we arrived for breakfast, we were asked to sit in a dining room a little further away from the main one we had been in on Friday morning..this room lacked the atmosphere of the first as well as the friendly service.

One other thing that should be mentioned is that the restaurants are VERY expensive! On our last night after a biog lunch and lots of walking, we were going to have snacks in the Rialto bar but with a burger and chips costing about \u00c2\u00a323 we soon changed our mind!

Our stay got off to a very bad start when we were shown to a first floor room overlooking an interior courtyard, instead of the top floor room overlooking the lagoon that I had booked. Since the hotel was supposedly completely booked, I was told by the hotel manager that there was nothing they could do. Later I talked to several different guests who had changed rooms based on their complaints, the most common of which was the loud noise in the rooms underneath the rooftop bar. The hotel is handsome and luxurious in many ways, but maddeningly inconsistent. From the outside it appears to be one monolithic building, but it is actually several different structures, all of which seem to be at slightly different levels. As a result, navigating through the hotel involves several ramps, odd passages, and cul-de-sacs --- very confusing. Handsome glass art pieces are featured, but many of the carpets in the hallways are worn and shabby. The rooms are handsome, but vary widely in style. Bathrooms have buttons and control knobs that appear to have no function, and heated towel racks that don't heat. There are no reading lights for the bed, but several mysterious switches located a few inches from the ceiling (???). Internet service and in-room movies are quite expensive, and selections limited, except for a plentiful supply of porn (\"Anal Debauchery\", etc). Room service was very spotty. At one point a housekeeper entered our room unannounced, without even knocking, and said loudly \"Are you OK?\" As we looked at her blankly, she left abruptly. Good thing we were dressed. The lobby area, bar and restaurant is well appointed and spacious. However, I could not find a clock there, or anywhere else in the hotel. There were only a few newspapers available, and only occasionally one in English. In the morning, coffee was thoughtfully placed out for the convenience of arriving/departing guests, but no wastebasket. As a result, empty cups and sugar wrappers littered the area. As a Hilton Honors member, I had access to the Executive Lounge, which was one of the highlights of our stay. Signs throughout the hotel show the Executive Lounge to be located on the sixth floor, but that space is empty. The Lounge is actually located along the outer edge of the lobby restaurant, outlined by a cast iron railing, with access controlled by a card key entry lock. The lock was disabled, so almost anyone could wander in and partake of the food & beverages offered, which were quite nice. Breakfast offerings included eggs, sausage, coffee & juices, yogurt, cold cuts, toast, pastries, etc. Later in the day, finger sandwiches and other light fare was available, along with beer, wine, and soft drinks. In the evening, several hot appetizers were offered. As has been noted, the rooftop pool and bar area offers outstanding views of Venice across the lagoon, and of the many cruise ships entering and leaving the port. There are several nice waterfront restaurants within walking distance of the hotel, mostly moderately priced. The one exception is \"Harry's Dolce\" which is quite expensive. Overall, this hotel has much to offer, but the lack of attention to detail, poor customer service, and physical deterioration of the facilities detracted from the enjoyment of our stay.", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "dublin", "Title": "\u201cOff on silly things\u201d", "Author": "gringottsgoblin", "ReviewID": "UR119147404", "Content": "The location is spectacular.

The journey this way is certainly different to your normal transfer to a hotel! The Molino Stucky sits on Giudecca Island, not far from the Cruise Terminal, and part of the experience was watching the cruise liners sail past between the main part of Venice and Giudecca, from the pool on the top of the hotel, or at the quayside. It looks as if everyone on the boats line the rails to watch travelling in and out of Venice. The courtesy shuttle taxis run frequently between San Marco and the hotel until late, and is a great free service saving you money on the water taxis. The hotel we found to be clean, efficient and the staff extremely polite. There are a couple of little restaurants on Giudecca that are well worth visiting either for lunch or evening meal if you fancy a change from going over to the main part of Venice. The room we had was overloking a side canal, and although not spectacular, was still pleasing enough. Large plasma tv and a number of English stations. The hotel even provided a congratulations card and a huge basket of fruit and a bottle of Cava - nice touch. Just one final recommendation. For our actual anniversary night, we went to the El Paradiso Restaurant which is in a small side alleyway off the quay, and just over the Rialto Bridge.

We had taken advice from other trip advisors who had sugested that we should use the Public Water Taxi from Marco Polo Airport. This we did and we booked the tickets on line and got them pre-booked for only 13 euros each way per person. I believe if we had booked them as a round trip we could have got them cheaper. The boat trip to the Giudecca Island takes 90 minutes and you do get to see so much of Venice doing it this way. When you finally arrive at the Hilton you will be taken back by the sheer size of the place. It is a very modern looking place and has over 350 rooms. We were very impressed with the speedy check in and the prompt arrival to our room (126). Our room was stunning and very good quality. There were a few stains on the carpet but the room was spotless and the bathroom was palacial. One thing to be mindful of. The room has a mini bar which is very expensive. The whole mini bar is computerised so do not lift out bottles to investigate as you could be charged. We did have the two small 500ml bottles of water and had to pay 6 euros for each. The breakfasts were amazing and you would not want for anything. We had champagnee every morning and enjoyed the full english breakfast. The hotel also has a brilliant outside pool on the roof which was great for sunbathing and relaxing after exploring Venice. Venice is an expensive place to visit and please be carefull in and around St Marks Square. They are totally out of order with the pricing of food and drink. My wife was determined to sit in St Marks Square and have a drink and watch the world go by. We sat down at one of the bars which had an orcestra of 6 playing. We were given the drinks menu and found that the cheapest beer cost 11 euros for a 300ml bottle. We had one each at a cost of 22 euros and then got presented with a bill for 34 euros. To our amazment they had also charged us 6 euros each for the privelage of listening to the music. What ever anyone says a bill for 34 euros was far to much. A great place to eat in the evening is the Hard Rock Cafe. What value. A total of 60 euros gave us both a starter and main plus two large beers each. We absolutley loved Venice and would go back in a heart beat. If you shop around you can get some excellent places to eat and drink. We were surprised that St Marks square used to flood each day with between 4-6 inches of water. They do have board walks that you can use to walk around but these do get very crowded so pick the right time to go. We found about 1200-1300 the water was at its highest and the eneviatble problems in the square happened. We can only say good things about the Hilton Milino Stucky. It is a wonderful place and we felt spoilt and very relaxed as you are away from all the hussle and bussle. The hotel also has a regular free water bus service which is excellent and the timetable is very much kept to. We have tried to be as honest as possible with this Hotel/Venice review. It is magical.

I thought this hotel was really nice - the conversion from an old flour mill has been done sympathetically. My room was very nicely done. I particularly thought that room service was very good. I also appreciated a complimentary bottle of Prosecco they sent up to me (I think because of the tier of my HHonours card, but I was just happy to drink it!). This is a large hotel and the layout was a bit confusing to be honest. If you are staying at the front of the hotel then you need to take the lift down to the Lobby and then walk to a different lift to get up to the pool. It's not a big deal but worth mentioning. I had access to the Executive Lounge which I thought was ok, but it was a bit strange that it is just a fenced off part of the main restaurant and bar. I didn't feel inclined to spend much time in there. The lounge used to be on the top floor and was obviously much bigger in the past. I thought the pool was spectacular but that a bit more attention should be paid to tidying up the sunbeds etc. There is no poolside service it would seem but there is a bar next to the pool so get your own drinks is the story there. They allow smoking around the pool which is not very nice to be honest. The hotel provides a free boat transfer to Venice (to Zattere and San Marco) and the timings are reasonable. However on more than one occasion the boat went early and I found the staff to be a bit rude. I got there just as they were about to leave (early) on one occasion and was told \"no, its full\". Well it certainly was not! very frustrating as the next one wasn't for an hour. If you are coming from the airport take the blue line boat from the airport, but be warned it takes approx 90 mins and stops everywhere on the way. The cost is 25Euro return. This is probably the cheapest way to get to the hotel and is a reliable service. The most disappointing aspect of the hotel was the bar/restaurant on the Ground Floor, next to reception. I ate there on my first evening. I think I could safely say that you should avoid eating here! I was suspicious that it was completely empty at 8PM... Anyway, I ordered a pasta dish which was a staggering 24Euros. When it came I am not exaggerating to say it was tiny - the size of a starter. It was actually quite tasty, but I told them it was way to small (I'm European, so used to small portions), they immediately knocked 20% off the bill which was quite fair but I got the impression that this was a common complaint. You can eat much better five minutes down the quayside near the Vaporetto stop. And in Venice itself there are some great places to eat for much less money.

The shuttle bus service is great and very regular it makes your visits into town so romantic and great fun, only takes 10 mins and stops at two places, get off at the first stop and take the 30min walk into St Marks square through the old streets and bridges great way to see Venice. Venice is the most romantic city I have ever been to really enchanting. Back tot the hotel, it has a great roof top bar with fab views spent many a night drinking champagne up there and the music is great and candlelit at night. There is a roof top swimming pool which is amazing great way to unwing for an hour before dinner, the executive lounge is ok for drinks and little nibbles never ate at the hotel always in Venice and the food in the town is great.

Wanting to experience the culinary delights of Venice, we endured an exhausting excursion which required numerous water shuttles, water taxis and the connection times that go with such a trek... and it was not even close to being worth the time, energy or the money (and it had a great rating on TripAdvisor!). Upon returning to the Molino Stucky, I discussed this with Marko Ludovici, the front office manager who compassionately convinced me to try the Hilton's gourmet restaurant \"Aromi.\" The next evening after an exhausting day of sightseeing in the heat, instead of embarking on yet another tiresome \"adventure in travel!\" - we simply dressed and took the elevator to the lobby, then strolled out the door and into the wonderful, gracious care of Giovanni Burrafato, the maestro and ma\u00c3\u00aetre d' of \"Aromi.\" Stunningly, Giovanni transformed \"having dinner\" into \"fine dining\" Venician style! It was an evening that resenbled a symphony of elegance and grace. Excellent food, unbelievable service, an event we will never forget. Giovanni gave us memories of Venice that matched the dreams we'd had of Venice!

The room was very large with a living space and they even gave us an extra bed for our 8 year old at no additional charge. The room faced another building, but looking sideways out the window you could see the Guideca Canal and the heart of Venice. You could make out the domes of various basilicas, and hear the churchbells in the mornings. The bathroom was incredible - beautiful marble and a very nice bathtub.

Overall, a great looking, comfortable, and convenient hotel. We stayed in a king room, which was gigantic by Venetian (or even European) standards, with a huge bathroom, modern furnishings, and a charming view of the Giudecca Canal where we could see the cruise ships coming and going. The hotel itself was very large, modern, and well decorated. It had a boutiquey vibe that is probably not too common in Venice. Even though the hotel is located on Giudecca, the convenient shuttle boat made us feel like we were still in the middle of the action. The boat was always on schedule (both departing and returning to the hotel) and took only about 10 minutes. The hotel staff was fair. We had a bit of difficulty checking in, due to the fact that our room was booked using Hilton points and we had not brought a print out confirmation of this. We were told that we had to have a paper copy of the reservation, but luckily the hotel had a free computer and printer in the lobby we could use to retrieve our email confirmation. Our experience with the hotel concierge was also just ok. When finding out options for our return back to the airport in the morning, the concierge insisted that the Alilaguna boat (a 2 hour journey?) was the only way to go. Having spent several days in Venice the year before, we knew that while a bit costly, taxi boats were readily available. This is what we ended up taking to get back to the airport. The taxi is its own little adventure, as it navigates the narrow canals to make its way through the main island and out to the airport. It is a 30 minute ride that is well worth 100 Euros if efficiency is important and you are willing to spend a little bit more for convenience.

The hotel is beautiful and wonderfully refurbished from a former historic flour mill. The rooms were spotless and well-appointed with comfortable beds and spacious bathrooms. The hotel staff were efficient, pleasant and accommodating. As Hilton Honors Gold member we had access to the Executive lounge which had great food and beverages throughout the day. Others have mentioned the difficult location. This was my fifth time to Venice and NO hotel is easy to get to with bags and I didn't find the Hilton any more problematic than any of my other visits to other Venetian hotels. Also we found the shuttle to be reliable and frequent enough to serve our needs. Water taxis and the ACTV are both expensive and we found the shuttle to be a nice touch and saved a lot in taxi fares. One suggestion, the hotel is listed near the ACTV Palaca stop which is a short hike to the hotel. Especially with luggage. The hotel shuttle however stops adjacent to the Zastere ACTV stop on the other side of the canal. This was MUCH more convenient and was how we returned to parking lot at Pizalle Roma. It would be helpful if the hotel put the shuttle schedule on their web site, if they already do, I was unable to find it! Final suggestion is the hotel website also does not explain very well the parking situation for those (albeit I am sure few) who drive to Venice. For others that drive, you can park at the Tronchetto or Pizalle Roma parking garages at the end of the causeway. The Tronchetto lot is cheaper I believe but you have a long walk to either the Tronchetto ACTV stop or must take the people mover to Pizalle Roma. We parked at Pizalle Roma (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac25 per day) and walked across the street to the Pizalle Roma. You want to catch a number 2 line boat in the direction of Tronchetto -- not towards the train station -- it is about 4-5 stops from there to the Zastere stop which is across the canal from the hotel. The hotel shuttle boat stops at the dock just north of the ACTV stop and runs about every 20-40 minutes to the hotel OR get off at the next stop Palanca and walk about 500 meters to the hotel over two Venetian bridges.

We went there last March 7 to 9, 2011 and luckily, we didn't know that there was a huge festival going on there which they called Mask Festival. Going to Hilton Molino Stucky Venice is very convenient coz there's an Alilaguna Lines serving from the sea port near the Marco Polo Airport going directly to Hilton. We arrived approximately at the airport around past 12 in the afternoon and reached the hotel by 2pm. Our stay in Venice during that time was amazing coz there was festival going on and the best thing - the weather at that time was cooperating: sunny with blue sky though its a bit cold coz the season is still winter going to spring. Travelling from seaport going to Hilton is like having mini tour of the island already coz the Alilaguna lines passed by to almost all of the major tourist destination of the city and the scenery was utterly magnificent. Upon arrival at the hotel, we were greeted and attended by the door man very politely. The lady in the reception gave a warm welcome to us and gave a brief summary of the features of the hotel. Our room was upgraded due to I am a Hilton Honors Gold Member and I was delighted about that. The interior design of the hotel was magnificent, a truly Venetian Style. As far as I remember, we were allocated at 4th or 5th floor of the hotel. Upon arrival to our room, we were so amazed and delighted coz the room given to us was marvelous and chic. It was a room with a living room separated from the bed room. The best part was, our room was located to the view where you can see the top view of some main parts of the city. Apart from that, we were given complimentary bottle of Bellini (Flavoured Sparkling Wine) and some chocolates. Amazing. With regards to food at their bar lounge, nothing special. The service is quite a li'l bit slow or maybe we're just hungry and can't wait to stroll around that's why we want to be in a quick mode at that time. Since we have this Hilton Honors thingy, we got access as well with their Executive Lounge wherein you can have a mini buffet of canapes, sandwiches, sweets, light salad, some finger foods, softdrinks, juices and the best part is alcoholic drinks which were composed of beers, wines, spirits, liqueurs and of course the italian version of champagne - prosecco. At that time, since it was still winter, their swimming pool was closed. There were some place on top floors that were accessible to guests who wants to have an amazing view of the entire island of Venice. Since the pool was closed during that time, we just went to the Spa section of the hotel wherein you can indulged yourself and enjoyed their relaxing jacuzzi. The hotel's building itself was very big and if you got time to stroll around, you can still go to some garden within the hotel. One of the best thing I've experienced here was the BREAKFAST. The selections of food here was superb. I thought we're having lunch buffet already but the variety of foods, cold cuts, hot food and drinks was amazing. And the shocking part is - they served Prosecco with their breakfast - truly amazing. The distance of the hotel from the main tourist spots was like 15-20 mins by boat. The very good thing with this hotel, they have a private boat just for Hilton guests and this is complimentary at the same time it runs from early morning till late in the evening. Just to be safe, ensure that you always have the time schedule of the boat so that atleast you've got idea if your boat already left or your waiting for nothing. As far as I remember, the boat service got a break during lunch or dinner time or both. Although Hilton is secluded from the main Island coz the hotel is in Giudecca, I prefer to be like this coz it's away from noise and you have time to relax after your busy day/night strolling around the islands of Venice.

(Not sure if the actual price would be worth it in dollars...)", "Date": "August 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ljubljana", "Title": "\u201cHotel with a pool - a Venice rarity\u201d", "Author": "someone1Ljubljana", "ReviewID": "UR116880387", "Content": "We stayed here for a weekend when visiting the Bienale and chose this hotel as it's a little remote from the busy Venice centre. The hotel is located on a Guidecca island, which is a 5 minute ride by boat from San Marco place. If it was my first time in Venice I would rather stay in the centre, but after many visits it was nice to stay somwhere different. The Guidecca is not a touristy part of the city and you can see the locals doing their business and there are some caffes and restaurants that reflect the local spirit. The main reason for choosing this hotel was a pool on the top floor, where we could cool off every morning. If you came before 11 you could allways get a sun lounge, but afterwards you could only lay down on your towel. The pool is on the smallish side, but not too crowded as people prefer laying in the sun. The sight from the pool is amazing as it looks on Venice Zattere and the pool itself is put a bit higher than the sun lounges. The only complaint is that it closes too early (6.30). Night swimming would be amazing. There is also a bar nearby which has amazing views. The hotel room was nicely furnished in a classical style with wallpaper, heavy curtains and chandeliers from Murano glass. The room views are sadly limited to the courtyard mainly, as only the best rooms have a frontside water view. The rest of the hotel was nothing flashy, it was more understated. You could see some details and remainings of what the hotel used to be - a flour mill. Also the structure of the buliding shows that, wooden ceilings, an iron bell.. Another interesting thing: there is a women's prison just behind the hotel, but it's very quiet and you would never guessed it, if there wasn't for a sign and cameras. The service was nothing special, but was okay though as it'ssuch a big hotel. The free boat ride to San Marco and Zattere was quite frequent, butthe thing we missed was some benches in front of the hotel where people could sit while waiting for the boat. There is a lot of unused space and it doesn't make sense why aren't there any. The bottom point is I would go there again, but only during the summer so I could use the pool as Venice can get incredibly hot.", "Date": "August 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBest hotel In europe\u201d", "Author": "Acampoma", "ReviewID": "UR116850862", "Content": "By far the best service and amenities in all of Europe.

A total of 4 families. Each family had a member who had Hilton Honors Gold level membership so a couple of the perks we normally get are room upgrades and access to the executive lounge at Hilton properties. Upon check-in at Molino Stucky, we ended up with 2 executive level rooms, 1 regular King with a view room, and 1 executive level suite. Other than the king room, all of the rooms we received were upgraded from the original type of room booked. So far, so good. But this is where it ended. Although the room assigner at the hotel was doing his/her job, the front desk at check-in was clueless. We had walked straight to the Hilton Honors Member check-in desk upon arrival. The lady at the desk gave us these forms to fill out even though we clearly said that we are checking in and are already Honor members. Turns out the forms we filled out signed us up for Hilton Honors (I received my Blue entry-level card today!). When we asked if we were upgraded, she turned next to her to ask her \"manager\" in Italian. Her manager said something and didn't even address us (maybe she didn't speak English?). The check-in lady then told us no because we didn't pay for it. Fine, I didn't dwell on it (although I was perplexed since we did pay and was not traveling on points). When I asked next about the executive lounge access, she said that we didn't get it because we didn't pay for an executive level room. Oh well. So we headed to our room just grateful that we could get our rooms before the official check-in time. After a while, my husband decided to go down and speak to a different person at the front desk. He needed the internet access codes (another free perk for Gold members). Well, he lucked out and got someone who totally knew about Hilton Honors and the benefits. He reswiped our cards to give us executive lounge access, told us that we were indeed in upgraded rooms, and gave us our internet codes for the reminder of our stay. He was efficient, fast, and basically knew what he was doing. The other family members all ended up talking to him. So my one note to management at Molino Stucky if you are reading this - pleae staff Hilton Honors check-in desk with someone knowledgeable in the program! And please commend Besides the messy check-in, there are no major complaints from all of us. The rooms were nicely cleaned and beds very comfortable. My brother and sister-in-law's room did however have mosquito larvae on the shower floor. Upon calling housekeeping, it was cleaned up but they larvae returned 2 days later so we don't know if they were coming out of the drain or if there were female mosquitos laying eggs daily in their bathroom. Not a surprise considering the numerous mosquitos in Venice. We didn't have the maids opening up our windows but I did see several rooms being cleaned with opened windows during our stay. The buffet breakfast in the Molino restaurant was great. We didn't try the breakfast in the executive lounge. The buffet had a huge selection and looked clean (except for a couple of guests on two different occasions, where I saw them reusing their dirty but empty plates again). The executive lounge was as expected. Unfortunately, I'm sure there were guests using the lounge who didn't have access because the lock to the gate was broken and other guests were just letting people in upon sight. I did get asked by a young server if we had access but unfortunately he didn't ask anyone else. Overall, I would say that I would return to this property. Venice is beautiful and it was nice to come back to a clean AIR-CONDITIONED property away from the crowds! Just beware, like other reviewers have said, that the free water shuttle that Hilton runs may not let you on even though you were waiting there at the stop and there is room still on the shuttle, thus prolonging your wait another 20 - 40 minutes for the next shuttle. This was tough to do with small children in our group.

Without a high status upgrade, I was assigned a room with a view of the brick wall. There seem to be a lot of these no view rooms and it also seems they give them to the points people. My wife found this room to be unacceptable and we hit the desk. They changed the room to one with a view of th courtyard but changing rooms was a long difficult process because of where the new room was located. Seems that the hotel is more than one building and it is unbelievable how fare you can drqag luggage to change a room. Checked in and was told breakfast was another 30 Euros each but if I paid with check in it was only 15. That's something that is in character with Hilton ... overcharging for what should be free. Interesting that among those things you don't get when you use Hilton points is the internet for which they charge 16 Euros and hour. Truly takes your breath away when you are told that a hotel that considers itself high end charges for stuff that cheap motels give you for free. Between the view, breakfasgt and lack of free internet, one gets the idea that Hilton really doesn't care about customer loyalty. The location of this hotel is not really convenient. Yes, there is a shuttle boat that usually runs every 20 minutes, except when it isn't on that schedule because it is break time.The shuttle can get crowded enough for them to tell you that you have to wait for the next boat. Even when the seats are not full, I saw the boat captain turn people away because of capacity controls.supposedly forced on them by the Gov't. If you are going to the Maritima terminal for a cruise, you take the water but one stop. But if your ship is docked at the other terminal you have a really inconvenient run to get to the ship. Their shuttle will not take you to the ship ... despit what another reviewer said. The official rate for a waterf taxi from where Azamara docked to the hotel .... pretty much just across the canal was 50 Euros. That was the extraordinary rate quoted by the official water taxi people at the terminal. There is a water bus that will run you one stop to Zatere where you can walk over to where Hilton's boat will take you to the hotel. We found a nice bakery with excellent pastries at bargain prices by walking along the canal to where there are a strin of stores and restaurants. We actually stayed at the hotel twice on this trip, one day before and one after the cruise. I would choose something different if I had it to do over again. The big fancy hotel was not all that fancy but it was certainly pricey. The pool on the roof, you can talk about it and make it sound much better than it really is. The fact is that there is so little attention to providing something to sit on that many people end up sitting on the deck. Significantly fewer lounges than needed.and as soon as somebody gets up, somebody is hopping up to grab the lounge. I don't see this as luxury as much as it is an indicator of poor space planning. When they decided to put the hotel where they did, they took it out of the high cost district where people actually are close to the action. The shuttle taxi they provide only partially offsets the inconvenience of a location that too quiet.

The hotel is in a beautifully converted warehouse and Venice is a wonderfully romantic place to visit. As mentioned in some of the reviews, the Hilton is on an island opposite the main part of Venice. We chose it deliberately as we felt it would be nice at the end of the day to get away from the hustle of central Venice. We also liked the idea of the rooftop pool for a nice cool down at the end of the busy day which few central hotels offered!. Obviously if you prefer to be in the thick of it in the centre of Venice this would not be the hotel for you. Equally if you prefer small hotels this would probably not be for you either. There have been comments about the shuttle provided by the hotel and I would say that in our experience this pretty much ran on time and was regular and we used that quite easily to get over and back whenever we needed to. The hotel has obviously recently been converted in a very tasteful manner and so everything felt new and in good condition. The rooms were lovely and beds very comfortable as you would expect from the Hilton brand. We found the breakfast service generally to be efficient and friendly and with a good selection provided (buffet style). In addition, whilst expensive (and probably not somewhere to drink all night!) we also found the bar on the roof of the hotel was a nice place to have a final drink or cocktail before retiring due to its stunning views looking over onto Venice. We paid an upgrade to our room rate to get access to the Executive area which is a gated off area on the ground floor giving access to free drinks and coffee as well as a range of food/'nibbles' during the day. If you are going to be around the hotel during your stay and in the bar and are likely to make sufficient use of this then it is definitely worth considering paying the extra for access to this - the range of drinks and food available was very good. The one thing I would mention is that we had requested a front facing room with views overlooking Venice and were very pleased with the stunning views when we entered the room. However on moving in we realised that, despite being several floors up and with double glazed windows, the front part of the hotel was also the part where the hotel shuttle boat arrived and left from during the night (late into the night and then from 6am!). On our first night the revving of the engine disturbed us every half hour - although admittedly we are probably relatively sensitive to noise, so if this is not something that normally bothers you then it might not be an issue. We therefore went down to reception the next morning. Despite being surprised we could hear it from there, they were obliging and considerate (the receptionist could not have been more helpful in fact) and moved us to a room at the back of the hotel away from the shuttle. However in losing our lovely view they also upgraded our room slightly to a bit larger one which was a nice touch and enough to make us feel better about losing the view (along with our lovely peaceful nights sleep from then onwards!).

Our group was picked up from the airport and dropped off at the Hilton. It couldn't have been much easier. The hotel is beautiful, the room spacious and comfortable. We had a room on the sixth floor and had a beautiful view of Venice. The hotel provides a free shuttle that goes to Zattere, just across the canal and also down to San Marco square. The shuttle is frequent and convenient. You can catch the local water taxi at Zattere or a short walk down the canal at Palanca. You can purchase a 24 hr, 36 hr, 48 hr or longer pass and ride all over Venice, including Lido and Murano. So you have easy access to all the sights, but a quiet refuge to come home to. It only gets better, the breakfast buffett is terrific (and included with the room). It has a wide variety of foods including eggs, sausages, prochuitto, fresh fruits, an assortment of breads and pasteries, juices and they will even bring you a freshly prepared cup of capucinno. They have a beautiful pool on the roof, in which we enjoyed a chilly swim. The view was phenomenal! While staying at the Hilton, be sure and spend some time walking down Giudecca. There are some terrific restaurants near the hotel. We really enjoyed our least expensive meals at a little pizza and panni shop called \"La Foca\". The people who run it are very kind and friendly and make a terrific panni. We had ours made with ham, salami, cheese and mushrooms. The bread was fresh and crispy. Two sandwiches and two soft drinks only cost 10 euros! It was fun walking around and seeing the locals as they lived their normal lives.

We were originally supposed to stay at a different hotel but after the hotel agent our travel company booked it through went into administration we were given a choice of alternatives and we chose this one. It is on a little island just over the lagoon from the main tourist area but the hotel offers a free shuttle service which takes around 15 minutes to get to San Marco. It's not that frequent but there is an Alilaguna stop right outside the hotel or alternatively a public water taxi stop about a five minute walk down the main street. The hotel itself is lovely and extremely big but easy to navigate as there are signs on the walls directing you so finding your room in the maze of corridors is not too difficult. We had a great view across the lagoon which was lovely but the hotel advises people to keep the windows closed due to the mosquitos though they do provide mosquito plugs for everyone to use in their rooms. Saying this, we didn't have any problems with the mosquitos, though we took some spray with us so we wouldn't get bitten when we were out and about which seemed to work. The breakfast is really good with an extensive choice of food for all diets though in terms of evening meals the hotel choice is a little limited due to price but we ate there on the last night and it was very nice. The rooftop bar is great for cocktails but still very pricey but again, worth it for a treat. We paid for a private water taxi from the train station to the hotel as my husband had read that the public water taxi was a fair walk which we didn't fancy with our suitcases but we later discovered that it was no where near as far as we imagined. We asked for a price for the water taxi to the airport when we were leaving but at a 100 euros we decided the Alilaguna for 15 euros each was more feasible, though be warned, it takes an hour and a half to get to the airport as it stops along the way at San Marco, Lido, Murano etc. Venice is a great city and definitely worth a visit, Piazza San Marco is crazy with tourists but once you get onto the side streets it is much easier to get around. Murano is definitely worth a visit for the glass and the bridges such as Rialto are a must.

I am a Diamond member at Hilton, but that did not mean much at this hotel.

We missed getting on a shuttle due to the line and were forced to wait 40 minutes, and that shuttle didn't even to go San Marcos. 3) Executive Lounge is a joke. Food was always out and the service was awful. Two employees were always there, however I am not sure what they were actually doing. Water was out nearly every time I looked for it. Glasses were hard to come by. If you want eggs in the morning, good luck. They are gone in 5 minutes, and take another 30 minutes for a new batch. Most staffers were rude (with one exception). Not a good ratio. 4) Concierge, while helpful with making reservations, gave us wrong directions. We spend an hour each night walking around asking people where this place was. Both turned out at least 10 blocks from where we were told they were. It does not help that the Hilton map reads like one you get at Disneyworld. Not even close to drawn to scale. 5) Beds are stiff and uncomfortable. Not up to Hilton standards. 6) Venice is an expensive city; I knew that going on. However, what you pay for this hotel, you would be much better off staying in San Marcos. There is nothing special or unique about this place. I gave it two stars due to the value for money paid, poor service, and average facilities. And don't be fooled by the \"world class\" skyline pool.

The room was prepaid and the cruise line issued a hotel voucher. As I did not have my Hilton Honors number available when I made the booking, I later phoned Hilton directly and added the number to my reservation. No problem, and I received a confirmation via email from Hilton showing that it had been prepaid and that it was a \"King Executive with View\". So far so good, right? We checked in behind a crowd of people stumbling around in the lobby (only two people at the desk with at least 3 others just standing around) The long and short of it -- our room was TINY with twin beds jammed into a small alcove against the wall with about 2 feet between them and a \"view\" of an inside courtyard, a/c ducts and drab buildings. After much complaining and showing them a copy of the printed Hilton reservation, we were finally moved to the correct room which we had paid for (and very grudgingly at that) The room was comfortable and nicely appointed (in comparison to the previous version) with a lovely view over the Guidecca Canal. The area around the hotel is a bit isolated and removed from central Venice -- being on the island of Guidecca. The hotel did provide a scheduled complimentary water bus over to St. Mark's Square, but we did not use this since we planned to see Venice on our return from the cruise. Instead we walked along the canal and visited a few shops and cafes while enjoying the quiet and views. Despite putting out the \"do not disturb\" sign, as we were tired from a long day and half of travel, we were disturbed by housekeeping for turn-down service. Fortunately, we were both reading, as the housekeeper barely knocked then barged in the room. There was no apology, just a rude grunt and slamming of the door. We walked about the hotel in seach of the executive lounge, but were directed to a closed one, then no one seemed to know where to find the open one. The hotel is vast and filled with conventioners, cruise ship travellers and did not seem particularly inviting nor quiet. It is a large hotel and offers little by way of the true character and charm of Venice which we happily discovered the following week when we stayed at the La Calcina when we returned from our cruise and enjoyed discovering the real Venice. The Hilton is far too removed and institutional. And though pleasant, the staff all seemed to want to do only what was necessary and no more. The final insult came on check-out when I went to pay for our internet charge (which is 27 Euro per 24 hours and we knew this in advance) and a room service charge. Keeping in mind the room had been prepaid directly to the cruise company and the hotel voucher presented at check-in. Included in the bill was another room charge! I pointed this out and they first tried to tell me that the room had not been prepaid. They were unable to produce the hotel voucher, though I offered them a copy to show it had indeed been prepaid. So then they tried to tell me that the room charge was for the \"upgrade\" we received to the room with a view. Again I showed them the original Hilton reservation confirmation showing that our room was already the executive room with a view so there had in fact not been an upgrade at all. They nevertheless insisted I had to pay this charge. I refused and asked to speak with a manager. The manager again went through the same spiel and even tried to take the papers away from me so that I couldn't prove what I had claimed.

However, there were not nearly enough lounge chairs in the pool area to accommodate the guests who came to use the pool or sunbathe. We asked the concierge (a bald, middle aged gentleman) to make us a reservation for a water taxi to the airport for the next morning. He asked us for our room number, then what time we wanted the taxi, then asked for our room number again. He was not at all helpful and was downright rude and condescending. When we came to the lobby the next morning to wait for the taxi, the front desk staffperson told us there was no reservation. Then the original concierge came up to us and told us the taxi would be here soon....we watched him call for a taxi then. Thank goodness we had allowed ample time to get to the airport.

Top notch service, everyone went out of their way to accomodate.

After a week of the cozy/charming/romantic Italian hotel experience, the scaled up size and modern fit out of the Molino Stucky was most welcome. The gym/spa is small by US standards, take a run and do your push-ups along Guideccas waterfront instead. Molino has the pool on the roof and yesss the view from up there is pretty cool. Yes, Giudecca is a tad out-of-the-way too, never more than a 30 minute boat ride from where you are or going to in Venice. It was never an issue for siteseeing and restaurantouring, and kinda neat for the kids too. Do call ahead to the concierge for the hotel shuttle schedule, or just take the vaporetto which stops a few hundred meters stroll from the hotel on the west end of Giudecca. You're fine either way unless you've got tons of luggage in tow, inwhich case the hotel shuttle or a private taxi is the way to go. The bar is large and comfortable for lounging while you wait for a water taxi, but it's safe to assume naturally that you will be dining out simply because the options for good eats in Venice are inexhaustible and an experience in itself that should not be missed.

We got a Venice view room, access to the exutive lounge, and free buffet breakfast. The room was not huge, felt very luxurious. I was struck by the beautiful wood ceilings that are in the lobby and all of the rooms. The ceiling really gave the hotel a very luxurious, yet cozy and rustic feel. All of the decor was luxurious and updated. Our room's window was also beautiful. It oped up to look out over the Guidecca Canal, giving a beautiful view if Venice from across the waterway. The buffet breakfast and the lounge were beyond our expectations! The breakfast has tons of choices and we had cappuccinos and mimosas every morning, The breakfast would have been a bit expensive if we hadn't had it included, but if you are not worried about paying 30 euro for breakfast, then go for it. It was a great start to each morning we had there. The excutive lounge was also an amazing perk. From 11am to 11pm, we had access to unlimited soft drinks, water, wine, beer, and champagne. Depending on the time of day, they also had cocktails, desserts, and appetizers. The lounge was right in the main part of the lobby and was a perfect place to have a glass of wine before catching the water shuttle to town for dinner. As for the hotel water shuttle, as long as you have the schedule with you, it is incredibly convenient. It leaves the hotel every 20-30 minutes and picks up at two central locations in venice. We never once thought it to be an inconvenience. After our 3 days in Venice, we went on to Florence and Rome. This hotel was tied for our favorite with the Rome Cavalieri, one of the top Waldorf Astorias in the world. I had expected the Rome Cavalieri to be much nicer than the Molino.

They also allowed us to access the Executive Lounge for free drinks (including alcohol), snacks and Internet access. We were tired so we found this as compensation enough, although I would have negotiated for more. The Tourist Suite was nice, but it offered less closet space than a regular room.

When we get to our room it didn't look anything like the room we had booked, it was much smaller and when I looked outside our window the view was of building work - not the beautiful view that we had originally thought we would experience. On the first night we went downstairs to take the shuttle so we could go out for some dinner, after waiting a while for the annoying shuttle to arrive I asked the concierge if we could take a private boat to the restaurant and asked how much it would cost, i obviously didn't want to pay a fortune. To my amazement he told me the price was 6 Euros so we booked it. After waiting another 20 mins for that boat to come which then seemed like a waste of time because we could have taken the shuttle after all, we took the boat to dinner.

The hotel buildings are certainly impressive and we were made to feel special on arrival at the hotel, with it impressive reception. The renovation has been very sympathetic to the building's former use, with lots of exposed wood and steel beams, and I cannot fault it at all in that respect. As HHonors gold members we were given use of the executive lounge on the ground floor which was excellent, serving a wide choice of snacks and canapes throughout the day and also a good choice of complimentary beverages. We could quite easily have gotten by on the food and drink in there alone! The hotel did have one or two downsides however.

We had a deluxe room plus (booked on Lastminute.com for half the usual price!) which was very spacious, clean and well appointed, with lovely exposed wooden beams and a wonderful (and huge) bed. The view of the canal between the two islands was extensive and had it not been so misty (can't really blame the hotel for that) would have been very beautiful. The hotel is VERY expensive when it comes to things like food. On our first night we arrived quite late and didn't fancy going back out to the main island, so ordered room service. For two basic baguettes, it cost us \u00e2\u201a\u00ac38. Oh and don't take anything from the in-room mini-bar. A small Toblerone is \u00e2\u201a\u00ac8 and things are automatically charged to your room if you take them out! Staff in the hotel are very polite, friendly and helpful. It makes a nice change to have someone open doors for you and say hello every time you see them. Breakfast is great. You can take your time, and there is a huge amount of choice of fresh fruit, pastries, breads, cereals, meats, cheeses and fried. You can even pour yourself a big glass of sparkling wine each morning! Thanks to take note of: The free shuttle-boat between the hotel and the two stops on the main island. When we first arrived in St Marks square we spent at least an hour walking up and down the promenade looking for the right pontoon for the Molino Stucky boat. It is only marked by a small timetable and is near-impossible to see in the dark. We were expecting it to be more obvious and after the walk from the bus station at the top of the island we were very tired so we didn't expect to have to spend so long hunting for it. Once we knew where it was, however, using the shuttle boat was extremely easy. It was always on time and never too full. For your info, the main pontoon at St Marks square is near a large statue, directly opposite a hotel/restaurant called Pensione Wildner. As already mentioned, the food in the hotel is very expensive and I think this is a general theme throughout Venice. However, there is a supermarket directly opposite the hotel on the main island.

We ended up paying about $150/night for it by using Hotwire. The first thing about the hotel is that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on a separate island from Venice proper in the Guidecca. We read Elton John actually has an estate in the island. We took a vaperetto from St. Lucia to Zattere and picked up the complimentary hotel shuttle from there. It was like clockwork, seriously. The hardest part was simply navigating a crowded vaperetto with our luggage. The hotel shuttle drops you off right in front of the hotel, and we were able to check in immediately. We were given a room in one of the back towers (this hotel is a maze \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was a former mill) overlooking a small courtyard. The room was quite large by Venetian standards and beautifully appointed. After Florence, we relished the luxury of the bathtub, the large marble bathroom, and comfortable bed. The staff was friendly, although not entirely efficient \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they run on Italian time. One thing that concerned me when I read the reviews was the hassle of the hotel shuttle, but truthfully, it was very easy. We could go to Zattere or directly to San Marco on a set schedule. There was also a vaperetto stop within minutes of the hotel when the hotel shuttle wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t running. We spent many nights roaming around Venice, and we were still able to get back via hotel shuttle. Additionally, I got up before the hotel shuttle was running one morning to photograph the city, and I was able to catch a vaperetto to San Marco without a problem. There is a period of time during the evening when they take a break, but you can schedule around that. You can get a full schedule from the front desk. The location of the hotel is fantastic. Venice is very crowded during the day, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nice to have reprieve from the crowds when you return to your room. The hotel was very peaceful and we never heard our neighbors, even though the hotel was sold out while we were there. Breakfast is pricy, so I suggest visiting the market and bringing things back to your room. There is a Billa market within a 5 minute walk of the Zattere stop with reasonably priced groceries. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a wonderful rooftop bar with beautiful views of the city. We never tried the restaurants, but Gianni\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at the Zattere stop was pretty tasty with a varied menu. We had more than a few meals there after a long day of sight-seeing. Overall, I would recommend this hotel over anything near San Marco, the Rialto or on the Grand Canal. The traffic is just too frantic, and I would tire of fighting the crowds. Plus, you have to contend with the aqua alta throughout the day. The Molino Stucky is a calm oasis and a beautiful place to rest after experiencing the beauty of Venice. The beds are comfortable, the air conditioner works well, the windows open, and the service is very friendly. What more do you want?

We found it straightforward (after quite a walk at Marco Polo Airport) to use the waterbus service where the hotel is the final stop on one of the major routes. Using the waterbus allows you to see the whole of the city in the lagoon, including Saint Mark's, before you actually get to your hotel. The first impression of the hotel is very impressive and this carries on once you are inside. The twice hourly (and free) shuttle taxi is ideal and ensured that the city centre was only ever 10-15 relaxing minutes away and this service continued to relatively late (11-11.30ish from memory). The food in the bar area is to be avoided - poor and very expensive - but the breakfasts were superb. Beautiful room with an entirely separate serving room where all the usual foods were attractively displayed and freshly prepared. The room was very comfortable. The one negative point relates to when we wanted to go the island of Murano. When asking about waterbuses the hotel provided us with a complementary watertaxi. Unfortunately this was available because of an arrangement they have with the Signoretti factory. This as it turned out is a very important factory which produces some beautiful glass. However, the whole sightseeing experience was marrred by the extremely high pressure sales techniques used. It soon became clear we were expected to buy something in return for the taxi trip. We managed to escape with a small piece of glass for 200 euro and when you consider the taxi might have cost 80 euro one way we probably got off lightly especially given the pieces we were being 'sold' initially were in the 3,000 euro region.

Walk to one of two Vaporetto stops ( Sacca Fisola and Palanca) 5 minutes walk either direction. The 41, 42, and 2 lines run every 10-20 minutes during the day, and the 2 line runs all night with a more limited schedule (every 40 minutes) so even when the hotel shuttle stops, you can get within walking distance of the hotel.

We traveled as HHonors Diamond members like many reviewers, but that didn't have anything to do with the hotel, the way we were treated or where the hotel was located. We thoroughly enjoyed taking the FREE (for ALL guests) vaporetto over to Zattere or St. Mark's Square every day, sometimes twice a day, and then relaxing on the short ten minute ride home. It was no different than being anywhere else and having to take a shuttle or taxi. I don't know what people expect, especially from a city WITH NO CARS! It's amazing to me that they get around on their feet and boats! The shopping was great, the food was great, and if you figured out how to order, you spent no more than you do back home. I mean we actually got a cheese pizza for $6. I can't get at that in the USA. AND it was authentic and so good. Our room was nice, breakfast was nice and the lounge was wonderful.

No problems at all. MOOD/CROWD: Lame. Not a cool place at all. Lots of cruise and convention people there. Feels like you're in Orlando if you were to just look at and listen to the guests. FOOD: The formal restaurant , Aromi, was excellent. One of my favorite meals for the whole trip. Make reservations. It's really, really good. Gentlemen must wear long pants not shorts but otherwise no dress code. The buffet breakfast was DISGUSTING. Worse than Dennys and it's 35 Euros per person. Don't do it. I cannot say enough how bad the buffet was. Quality was poor, selection was poor, bacon and scrambled eggs nearly inedible. Cheese looked like Kraft from the USA supermarket. Ridiculous.

I felt that it was actually dangerous and was reluctant to shower in it, but had to because of our long flight and the hot, humid weather. It seemed very likely people could get hurt.

Breakfast was not included in our stay so in order to get breakfast one could pay 30 Euros/pp ($40 USD)...It was difficult to get just coffee (they did have powdered instant in the room) without getting on a shuttle to cross the Guidecca Canal. The hotel allowed coffee if you also bought other things on the menu. Information was also difficult to obtain from the staff, even the concierge when approached glared at me as if I was interrupting him...nothing warm and welcoming there. I will say the room was very nice, the bed firmer than I would want but my husband was comfortable. Internet access was 22 Euros/day ($30 USD). We felt that because we had purchased our room from a popular hotel booking web site as we had been reminded by the desk, that we were not being treated as a full fledged guest.", "Date": "September 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201ccharged with no refund\u201d", "Author": "selsa10", "ReviewID": "UR79579408", "Content": "We booked the Hilton Molino Stucky.

On award stay, confirmed King Deluxe room. Arrived via train station. Vaporetto was a little challenging, especially with luggage. We took to Zattere and then boarded the Hilton complimentary boat. Hotel itself is beautiful. What an amazing restoration of this old mill. Unfortunately, I was not blown away, and felt disappointed. Check-In: I went to the Hilton Honors line which was directly beside the regular check in. No one was in line but me. At least 3 associates behind the counter in the regular line established eye contact with me, but no one came over. After waiting at least 5 minutes, I moved to the regular check in line. I was told that I had received an upgrade, which I appreciated. I asked if I had a canal view, and was told that I did. I was informed of the location and hours of the executive lounge, and given the code for the free internet (now available for Gold and Diamond). I asked about the breakfast benefit and was told I got the buffet for each day of my stay and to provide my room number and there would be no charge. Room: 422, a very small living room, bathroom with no tub (just a shower), and a separate bedroom. There were several large stains on the living room sofa, and cigarette butts left outside the window. My view not a canal view as I was told, but rather an old abandoned building on the side of the property. A very small slice of the canal view. I have never slept on such a hard bed. We actually dreaded going up to the room at night. It felt like we were laying directly on a box spring. This was definitely no Hilton Serenity Bed. We never slept thru an entire night and found ourselves tossing and turning a lot. We could never get comfortable. The couch in the living room was no better. Several TV channels available including CNN, Sky News etc. As others have commented, a bottle of Bellini is left in your room. Not chilled, just left on the night stand. Of course we wanted to enjoy but it needed to be chilled. I called to ask where the ice machine was located, was informed that it was broke and I had to go thru room service. I asked if I would be charged, and was told no. It would have been nice if the bottle was already chilled so you can enjoy it. I think most people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually end up drinking it because they have no way to chill it, so the bottle ends up getting recycled. Executive Lounge: Located adjacent to the Rialto bar on the main floor. Key card access. We found the food offerings to be very good. Hours of operation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 11a \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 11pm. Noon service is sandwiches; around 2 pm are desserts, and 6 pm heavy hors dourves and salad offerings. Wine/presecco/juice/tea coffee etc available all the time. Hard alcohol is only available from 6-8ish. BTW- Once a bottle is gone, it is not replaced. My husband got the last drop of vodka which was not enough for a drink. Asked for another bottle and was told \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it, no more\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. There are 2 computers available for use in the lounge, password required and limited to 20 minutes at a time. Most times, seating was not a problem. It was busier in the evening when people got back from dinner and wanted a night cap. Friday nights seem to be the busiest as the hotel is full with pre-cruisers. I commend all the staff in the lounge. They were friendly, professional and were always clearing plates and restocking the food. Excellent service! Internet for Gold/Diamonds: Free, must physically get a new code from the front desk each day. We asked if it was possible to get all the codes for our entire stay vs. coming to the desk everyday. With hesitation, they finally accommodated our request. It is limited to 2 IP address. Gym/Spa: Complimentary for Diamond. Otherwise there is a $15 charge. Turn Down Service: Provided the first night, then you have to call the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Magic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd line to request. On our first night, there were 2 bottles of water left at each night stand, and candies on the bed. What was funny is that every night after, only one bottle of water was left. I called the Magic line to inquiry and was told that as a Diamond, you get 2 bottles of water the first night and then only one bottle. I had to laugh. I almost wanted to ask if that goes for the candy left on the bed too. Housekeeping: Unlike most European hotels, wash cloths were in the bathroom. They were never replaced during our stay despite seeing them on the linen carts in the hall. I called the Magic line and requested, but never got. We ended up grabbing some from the cart. Coffee cups and kettle was never put back in its place. If I left my coffee cup in the living room in the morning, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where it was in the evening. Overall, not stellar service. Staff was very rude. I came off the elevator one morning, 2 housekeeping staff was arguing in the middle of the hallway, they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even move for me and continued to argue. Buffet Breakfast: Free for Diamonds, just provide your room number. Full offerings, eggs cooked to order (which were never cooked correctly), and prosecco available. Like the executive lounge, I found the staff very friendly and professional despite being very busy. Sky Bar and Rooftop Pool: What an amazing view from the rooftop. It was too cold during our stay to use the pool. I would recommend that you go to the Sky Bar at least once during stay. It is pricy, but I thought the Bellini\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s were better than Harry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Hotel Staff: As other reviewers have commented, I found the staff to be very rude. Staff would walk right by you and never say hello. They appeared aggravated an annoyed at you when you asked a question, like they were being put out. A great disappointment having come from a Sofitel in Florence where the staff provided superior service. Hotel Boat Shuttle: While this is a nice service, I would encourage others to invest in a Venice Connect card and purchase unlimited Vaparetto service. The Hotel boat only goes to Zattere and San Marco. This really limits your options. During our 5 nights, we only used the complimentary boat service 3 times. Overall Impression: This is a beautiful property with lovely facilities. It does not live up to the Hilton Standard I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve come accustomed too with other European properties. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apparent to me, based on the numerous reviews of this property, that the application of Hilton benefits/upgrades for Diamond members is inconsistent.

I had mixed expectations as I had read various, conflicting reviews, so wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite sure what to expect. From the photos I had seen and from the hotel website it all sounded and looked amazing, and I was really looking forward to visiting Venice for the first time, but I had nagging doubts, as I had read a lot of bad reviews about the service. Having booked on Hilton points, I was allocated a standard room, but on arrival at the hotel I discovered that, as an Honors Diamond member, I had been upgraded to an executive room, which was nice. However, when I asked if there was a possibility of paying to upgrade to a suite I was told that they had no standard suites left and, as they only had one Suite \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcplus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 available (a one bedroom suite with water views), it was unlikely that they would sell it at a discount. At this point I sent my girlfriend off to enjoy some drinks in the executive lounge while the receptionist had a little chat with the manager. A few minutes later she came out and offered to upgrade us for 250 Euros / night. After some friendly negotiation, we agreed on 150 Euros / night, which, considering I hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t paid for my room in the first place, was a pretty good deal \u00ef\ufffd\u0160 I joined my girlfriend for a drink in the lounge while our bags were delivered to the room and then we went up together. The room was absolutely gorgeous, with a large lounge, a decent sized bedroom and a beautiful bathroom. There was a complimentary bottle of champagne and a fruit platter left out for us and the squeal of delight from my girlfriend when she saw the view made the upgrade cost worth every penny. We got up on Saturday morning and went to the restaurant for breakfast. We were escorted to our table and then taken next door and given a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of the buffet. It was huge and looked nice, but I really fancied Eggs Benedict and my girlfriend wanted an omelette, so we asked the waiter if the kitchen could make them for us. Nothing seemed too much trouble, and ten minutes later our breakfast appeared, exactly as requested and tasted delicious! We explored Venice on Saturday, using the hotel shuttle, which was quick and easy. After visiting St Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s square, we stuck mainly to back alleys, visiting quirky little stores and finding hidden gems all over the place, before heading to the Rialto bridge and finding a caf\u00c3\u00a9 for an early dinner. I was impressed at how cheap the food was, as I was expecting to be ripped off, but we paid less then 70 Euros for two courses with wine, including service, so it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly break the bank. We did some more exploring after dinner, commenting on more than one occasion how glad we were to being staying somewhere away from the noise of the main island. After taking the Hilton shuttle, we arrived back at the hotel around 8.15 and decided to head upstairs to check out the roof top bar. The view from up there, especially at sunset is amazing! I was lucky enough to get a sofa outside while my girlfriend went to the bar. I had read in advance that the drinks weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cheap, so I was prepared for the shock of 16 Euros for a Mojito. What I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prepared for was what my 16 Euros would actually buy! Danielle returned from the bar with what looked like pint glasses and they were by far the best Mojitos I have ever tasted! The lime and the mint were clearly very fresh and it seemed like they had done their best to squeeze as much alcohol into the glass as possible. Seriously, the drinks may not have been cheap, but they were definitely good value! After our Mojitos, we enjoyed a bottle of champagne in the warm, night air and headed back to the room. Breakfast on Sunday was a similar affair to Saturday; Good food and good service. We went down just before 11 to catch the end of service, having enjoyed a long lie while my girlfriend went to the spa for a pedicure, but the kitchen was still happy to cook eggs to order. In fact, another couple arrived, looking quite flustered, at 11.15 and, despite the fact that breakfast was clearly over, the staff were still happy to accommodate them, so again, I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fault the service. On the way back to the room I asked for a late check out and agreed on 4pm. Rather than do more exploring, we decided to spend the day lazing by the roof top pool, which was absolutely heavenly. The weather was gorgeous and the views from up there during the day were incredible. It was the perfect way to end our weekend break, made better by a couple more Mojitos ;-) We used the lounge quite a lot during the weekend and enjoyed having access to free snacks and drinks. Breakfast was free courtesy of Hilton Honors, so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really need to spend a lot of money while we were there, but we had the most amazing weekend!

The Executive level gets you access to all the free drinks - alcoholic and otherwise, snacks, finger foods, etc that are available all day in the lobby. It also gets you free breakfast at their excellent buffet breakfast. The free breakfast will offset the upgrade cost. And the breakfast and all-day snacks were just great. The location is both good & a little bit of a pain. It's off the main island, so there aren't the huge tourist crowds. The hotel has a free shuttle boat that runs quite frequently. However, there's 2 stops over on the main island and the times are a little confusing. Some are direct back & forth routes and others hit both stops. Sometimes they run every 20 minutes, sometimes not. We had to wait almost an hour the one time, as we missed the boat by a couple minutes. Rooms were very nice and comfortable. Quite a bit bigger than the typical 'European' room. Service was excellent and the staff would go out of their way to help you. The rooftop bar & rooftop pool were excellent. Great view of Venice. Used the workout facilities and they were excellent. Really, really good. Also ran along the banks of the island and that was a great experience - would recommend it. Who else can say they ran along the banks in Venice, with that amazing view? About 5 kms from the hotel to the end of the island and back. 2 tips: First, if you're coming straight from the airport, the water taxi is 100 Euros. A little steep, but great views along the way. You're paying that for the boat, for up to 6 people. So boat-pool. Ask other people at the docks if they want to share. A couple asked us & it cut it to 50 / couple. Second, it cost us 80 Euros to get a water taxi from our hotel to the cruise ships - literally a 5 minute ride. You can see them from the hotel & it's not far.

Great bathroom. And a really comfortable bed! I read all the comments about the view from the roof, so we headed up there, but alas nothing was open due to a private party being set up! Unfortunately, they were charging guests a fee to attend! But managed to get a pic of Venice from the Skyline roof top bar. Ended up downstairs in the lobby for a cocktail in the Rialto Bar before heading out to AROMI restaurant off the lobby outside. Service was impeccable. Food was impressive. Although somewhat expensive (hotel food usually is), it was a LOT LESS expensive than our lunch meals near the Rialto Bridge! I didn't realize that our hotel rate included breakfast, so my partner and I went to search for the breakfast room. The hotel is so big we got lost! After finding the area, I wasn't too impressed with the room, but once being directed into the atrium area, breakfast was AMAZING! I've seen buffets, but was totally impressed with the food. They had everything for everyone. Fresh fruits, assorted yogurts, cheeses and meats, eggs, cereal, sausage, bacon and also complimentary Bellini's and champagne! Stopped at the Concierge desk, but Christian, Concierge was gone. But in his place, his colleague Federicka was willing to assist and book our Water Taxi back to the airport.

We got a great rate through Hotwire. Upon arrival, we were given a chance to purchase the buffet breakfast which wasn't included in the Hotwire price. While the buffet seemed expensive, it was far and away the best buffet breakfast we've had in our European travels. It was more like an American breakfast buffet with scrambled eggs, sausages, bacon, etc., in addition to the usual European fare of cereals, cold-cuts, hard boiled eggs and juices. Our room, on a corner overlooking the canal couldn't have been nicer - nice size, comfortable bed, over-all a good experience. The hotel is fairly recently created (apparently) from an old flour mill. The original wood support posts and beams were used in the construction, rather than hidden making for a unique, comfortable design. Because our room overlooked the canal and the hotel's shuttle boat dock, there was some noise but it didn't last into the wee hours; the noise was neither loud nor jarring. All rooms were accessible by elevator. Speaking of the shuttle; there is a free shuttle to St. Marks's Square that runs at least hourly from early morning to at least midnight (more frequently on Fridays and weekends. The shuttle goes from the pier in front of the hotel across the Guidecca canal to a stop right next to the Zattare Vaporetto stop, then on to St. Marks. The return also stops at the Zattare. The same shuttle crosses the canal to the Zattare and back, without going on to St. Marks. The hotel's web site has a schedule. If you're coming in from the airport, you can take one of the Alilaguna water buses for a very reasonable fare. We didn't do this, instead we took a water taxi which was very expensive (100 euro) but quite an experience in that we went right through Venice on smaller \"canals\" not traveled by the Alilaguna or the Vaporetti. We bought drinks at one of the bars in the hotel. They were expensive but well made. We didn't eat at the hotel (other than breakfast); but we did eat at a restaurant on the Zattare - right next to the shuttle stop - on 2 nights. Both meals were wonderful. (I don't know the name of the restaurant, but the sign above the door said \"Pizza\" and the floating pier on which we ate had dark green awnings.) Given that many hotel reviews we've read in researching our stay in Venice spoke of small rooms, high prices, noisy canal views, I'm very happy with our choice.

(what I now know in retrospect is that young children have a really limited capacity to view renaissance art all day!)

Also just minutes away is the first stop of the shuttle boat which is Zattere across the water - two minutes - with the Ponte Del Accademia bridge and the Peggy Guggenheim Collection (partly staffed by two adorable American students) just down the lane - icecream shop, resturants and a supermarket called \"Bila\"a little walk next to the water in the direction of the cruise ship docks (look out for the yellow and red shopping bags) - Then, when one wants to go into San Marco one just stays on the boat for a really short ride with a special hilton dock virtually in front of the Danieli. For visits to Murano the hotel organised a free taxi boat ride to a very fancy glass blowing factory - where I spied on the wall of fame Mick Jagger, as well as the actress from Medium, a nice fellow showed us around - the kids both had a turn at glass blowing which was a huge thrill. the sky would be the limit at the amount one could spend there I think it was called Signoretti - but dont fear, we just brought a couple of inexpensive trinkets for the kids - and they were still lovely.

What initially appeared to be a very good deal turned out far less than a good deal. Why was this hotel a bad choice: (1) Upon check-in and a request for a room with two beds, the front desk clerk basically said that with the internet booking, no such choice was available to us. However, for only \"39 Euros per day extra\", he would get us a room with two beds plus one with a view. We did get a very small room with two beds and even a view. Unfortunately, it also had a connecting door to the next room. We were kept up very late for two of our three nights at the hotel by loud voices and TV from next door...even the wall between the rooms was slightly opened at the top. I cannot remember EVER staying at a hotel, even a very cheap one, with such poor sound insulation. To spend the day walking extensively around beautiful Venice and then being unable to have a decent night's sleep upon return to the hotel was very frustrating. (2) I mentioned this upon check out (dissatisfaction with our stay). The clerk completely ignored what I had to say. The hotel staff had so involved with a large accounting/financial group that most of the time when we might have wanted help from the staff, it was too crowded at the various desks to obtain help. (3) The hotel location, on a small island across from the main island, had drawbacks. First, one had to get on a hotel shuttle boat to get to the main island with most of the attractions of the area, and then possibly onto another vaporetto to go further. Hence one's late night and/or early morning activity was tied to that hotel shuttle boat. Also, there were very few alternative restaurants or shops on the island where the hotel was located. (4) The hotel's continental buffet breakfast was quite good, but at 26 Euros extra per day along with extra the 39 Euros for our room, we could have easily stayed elsewhere. At least, we would probably have had a quieter room, breakfast included, a more convenient location for walking around the city, and much more personal, attentive service. The hotel itself is quite a beautiful property and had the staff been more attentive and the room quieter, perhaps we would felt better about it.

Only had difficulty one night when we stayed out in Venice past midnight, the Hilton boat was no longer running, but we finagled a way to take the ACTV one direction, get off, walk a couple 100 meters, then catch a different ACTV and it worked out. It does add some travel time, but you're generally taking boats all day anyway, so it's not a big deal. Hotel was great, upgraded with the Diamond status, had not seen an Executive Lounge like that - but for the record, it is because the hotel is renovating the \"real\" lounge...again, we made it work. Was amazed at what a huge property it was - this is a large hotel. Breakfast is busy but a great spread and service. Did not eat any other meals at the hotel as there are just too many great restaurants all throughout Venice. If I went to Venice again, while it may be intriguing to stay \"in\" Venice - I bet we would choose the Hilton again as you won't be as COMFORTABLE as you would be at the Hilton - oh one last thing - they have decent beds - much better than anything else you find in Europe where most of the beds seem straight out of prison cells!", "Date": "May 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yorkshire", "Title": "\u201cGood for the price we paid but not up to five star standard\u201d", "Author": "Yak-n-Gnu", "ReviewID": "UR63088951", "Content": "We used Hotwire to book three nights at start of May for UK\u00c2\u00a3103 (US$160) per night excluding breakfast - would always recommend doing it this way if you don't mind the gamble/fun of not knowing for certain where you'll be. In summary, very over-priced if you pay rack-rate, most facilities as expected of a 5* except rubbish air-con, poor room cleanliness/finish and everything extra is very expensive. Pros: - The complimentary shuttle boat is great although make sure you note where it drops you off because the stands are not clearly marked. - Nice to be able to get away from the chaos of the main islands. - Taking our relatively low rate into account, the hotel was very good value for Venice. - Staff seemed friendly and pretty good. - Modern room of a decent size - not the norm in Venice. Cons: - The air conditioning in our room was next to useless. It was much hotter in our room than in the corridor or outside even when we had it on full blast despite our room not getting any direct sunlight. Next door had their door propped open presumably to get the freezing cold air from the corridor into their room. If you arrive and find your room seems a bit hot then don't do what we did and assume the air-con would eventually sort it out - tell the desk. - The roof-top bar is very expensive. A Rossini (a Bellini but with fresh strawberry pulp rather than peach) was 14 euros, a martini was 16 euros, a spritz 16 euros and a small bottle of beer 8 euros. Great views of Venice from the outside terrace though and the cocktails were perfect. Watch out for very loud and awful music on a Saturday night (I mean Simply Red!). - A bit soulless - once inside you could be anywhere. - The pool is outdoor so not open all year round. - There were dog paw-prints on a glass surface in our room when we arrived!? - View from room was of a wall but got to expect this sort of thing when you use Hotwire. - Selection of tea/coffee provided included lots of herbal tea and decaf nescafe but only one proper tea and no milk. Housekeeping obliged as soon as asked. Other - If you walk along the waterside then avoid the first bakers you come to - they intentionally ripped us off and wouldn't be argued with. Might be expected for Venice but this was the only negative experience of this type that we had. - If you get a vaporetto to Giudecca then don't get off at Sacca Fisola - use Palanca - it's much easier to find the hotel entrance if you do this. - Eat at Altanella! - just five minutes walk away - book even if you think it won't be full. See separate review. - There's a cheap but good supermarket called Prix on the waterfront just before the Redentore vaporetto stop.

Breakfast was very good with enough choices to suit most people and again, the service was not lacking, even when the breakfast room was very busy one morning.

We had bought our bus tickets at the airport while waiting for our taxi as there is a Veniceconected booth there. We ventured up to the skyline bar on the roof of the hotel one afternoon and yes, the views are superb - but it was extremely busy so we didn't stay and have a drink. Unusually for a Hilton, their club lounge is just an area segregated from the main bar area - we have only encountered separate rooms for the lounges in other Hiltons, but this was fine. Check out was very easy - and an item that had mistakenly been added to our bill was removed as soon as we queried it. We had a lovely stay at the Hilton - the location made us lazy about going into Venice for the evenings - but we have visited Venice several times before and it was nice to explore Giudecca which is very pleasant to wander around and find different restaurants - and there are no throngs of tourists to push through (Venice was extremely busy over Easter - even busier than I have seen it in the summer).

This saves trundling one's cases around the streets of Venice, a very good thing. The hotel is, of course, in the vast and newly renovated warehouse at the western end of Guidecca. The check-in and checkout systems are reasonably efficient. So are the porters. All our bags reached our room long before we did. The public areas on the ground floor are huge and comfortable. They have been well fitted out with beautifully patterned marble floors etc and lots of comfortable seating. There is an excellent bar which does snacks, and the drinks in this bar seemed to be a good deal cheaper than the drinks up in the Skyline bar. We found the staff in the bar and reception areas on the ground floor, indeed all the staff, to be helpful and pleasant. Navigating around the building is a little tricky to begin with because each wing has its own elevators, but one gets used to it. We had a fairly cheap room in the middle wing, which had no view. The room however was excellent. It was quite large, as was the bathroom which had a separate shower and bath and was fully tiled in thick marble. The bed was large and comfortable and we slept very well indeed. The only slight complaints I have about the room would be that there did not seem to be much in the way of drawer space and the bathroom needed a little maintenance -- the shower hose was leaking, the handle on the bath was loose, and the doorstop was about to break off, etc. A more vigilant maintenance routine seemed to be in order, particularly as the hotel is quite new. One particular irritation was that the hotel made a significant charge for Internet use, a minimum of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac12, and that just for the first hour. I consider charging for Internet in an expensive hotel like this to be completely unacceptable. Internet use should be part of the service. The breakfast was okay. It was served however in a somewhat soulless restaurant on the ground floor but the buffet was reasonable and they brought a half decent cappuccino when asked, which is something of a rarity, even in Italy. The overall effect of breakfast was somewhat marred by the use of rather nasty paper place mats and serviettes and by putting mugs on the table. One might expect that in a Little Chef but it is hardly what one expects in an expensive hotel. The views from the roof terrace are indeed stupendous. The pool must be great fun in the summer months. We had mixed experiences of the Skyline bar (see my separate review), but the views from the terrace of the bar over virtually the whole of Venice and the lagoon are quite extraordinary. We also liked the quiet position of the hotel, which is far removed from the mayhem of San Marco. In order to get to Guidecca from Venice itself one can either take the vaporetto to Palanca, or the free hotel shuttle which goes across to Zattere twice an hour and San Marco once an hour. We spent a very pleasant few hours just wandering around Guidecca itself, finding pretty back streets and canals and then walking back along the waterfront opposite Dorsedouro from the Cipriani which is at the far end of the island. There are a number of pleasant restaurant on the island, including Harry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dolci, which is only about 100 yards away, and which is excellent. I'm not sure whether the hotel represents good value for money. It certainly was for us because we got a cheap deal off Air Miles. The simple fact is that almost all decent hotels in Venice are ruinously expensive these days and I doubt the Molino Stucky is far out of line with its peers.

Notwithstanding the difficulties mentioned by others with the timing of the shuttle to the hotel, this was by far the best hotel experience I've ever had. First, the staff greeting was warmly welcoming--not at all officious or snooty as in some other Hiltons (Milan, for example). I was given an upgrade; I understand that now there is a charge for the upgrade, even for \"gold\" members, but i'll be satisfied with an interior room. The bathrooms are a work of art even in the standard rooms (I peeked); the beds are clouds and the decor is bright despite the dark wood, which itself is warm and elegant. The hotel has an \"arrangement\" with a Murano glass factory. A private taxi takes you over and back for free, but you can see only that one factory. The desk clerk warned me that I could get the same glass at shops near St. Mark's Square for less, but I took the bait at the factory and bought there. I'm not unhappy that I did, because I was buying a \"total experience,\" not just glass. However, next time I'll take the taxi over, walk around to other factories, and then take the vaporetto back (again, as suggested by the staff). In the evenings I strolled about the island on which this historic hotel property is situated, and that gave me a pleasant break from the intense tourism accross the canal. The public spaces of the hotel were both elegant and cozy--quite a decorating feat--with much of the original bakery/factory structure preserved and polished up, and many little \"nooks\" where one can rest quietly. I could stay at other Hiltons for two nights instead of one that this one will cost, but the Molino Stucky experience is, for me, well worth it.", "Date": "February 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cWonderful views, comfortable room\u201d", "Author": "becannon", "ReviewID": "UR56092048", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for 2 night in May 2009 prior to boarding a Mediterranean cruise.

The hotel itself is either relatively recently remodeled or new so everything was in pristine condition. The mattress in the room was very comfortable and the staff at the hotel was quite accommodating. The real downside to this hotel (as has been mentioned previously) is its location to the main sightseeing areas in the city and the long periods of break for the shuttle. In the middle of the day and again in the evening the shuttle takes a long break (maybe 1.5 hours). Once you are aware of this and can plan, it is not a problem but if it catches you off guard then you could be prepared a long wait.

All in all, we have very fond memories of the hotel and would stay there again if we return. See more details and tips below. Location - Even though the location is not on Venice's main island, it is only a 12 min boat ride to St Mark's Square. With frequent hotel boat shuttles, staying a little away from the action was both relaxing and provided a truer view of Venice's daily hustle and bustle. Alternatively you can take the water 'bus' to and from the hotel. The bus stop is located approx 5 mins away from the hotel. * Water taxi rides can set you back approx 50 - 100 euros, don't bother. Service - The service is decent, but not fabulous. If you are from North America, you may be taken aback by some of the ways hotel staff handle questions and requests, but just remind yourself not to be offended--it's cultural. One plus was we got to the hotel around 11am, having just came in via night train from Paris; within 20 mins of our arrival, they placed us in a lovely room. Rooms - We booked the hotel via Hotwire, so I wasn't sure what kind of room we'd get. I was pleasantly surprised. Our room was spacious (especially for European standards), brights and well appointed. The bed was very comfortable. Pool - This is the hotel's \"piece de resistance.\" The modern roof-top pool provides a stunning view of venice, including st mark's square, etc... Depending on the time of year and fog cover, the roof-top pool is bright, relaxing and peaceful. There is an adjacent bar that uses the pool's deck at night. Restaurants - Although many of the restaurants looked nice, we didn't ever eat at the hotel--we were too busy exploring the sites and always seemed to eat on the go. I wish we'd had a drink at the bar at the top of the hotel. Tips - - Venice is overpriced, so if you want well-priced snacks, there is a little grocery store 10 mins away from the hotel. Go out the front doors and walk to the right. ask the concierge for directions because there is not a big sign to distinguish it. - Visit harry's bar (inventor of the bellini) for an overpriced, but incredible bellini. - The food in venice is less flavourful than elsewhere in italy. if you've been to other italian cities prior to arriving in venice, keep this in mind, so you're not too disappointed.", "Date": "January 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hockley, Texas", "Title": "\u201cBreathtaking Views....

The free hotel shuttle ran perfectly while we were there. We found it extremely convenient, and you can't beat the price (it's free as opposed to the 6.50 euro you pay for the public water shuttles). We also appreciated the view of Venice and the snow-capped alps from our bedroom window every morning.

In addition, a few hours later, the entire lounge up by the pool was also closed for a private function. The hotel appears to do a lot of convention business, and I believe this is why some of the amenities seem to be booked for private events. Had I paid full price for a room, I would not have been very pleased. We did call the front desk after finding out that the pool was closed, and we only received an 'I'm sorry it's closed'.

Well, It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not that I have been at many five-star hotels, but naturally my expectations were very high, especially because I decided to spend half my salary on a weekend outing. When my girlfriend and I arrived at St Lucia railway station, we thought it would be best to take a water tram to St Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, from where the hotel shuttle boat leaves, which was\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 a bad idea. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very difficult to find the location of the boat service around there. Perhaps it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wise to follow the directions on the hotel website, or email the hotel for precise directions, and have the hotel phone number ready. When we reached the landing in front of the hotel, a hotel boy rushed forward and grabbed the bags. Tired as we were, that was when we first felt we were given a special treatment, not the last time though \u00ef\ufffd\u0160 The hotel room (executive) turned out to be quite nice, and very nice and spacious for European standards \u00e2\u20ac\u201c American travelers, be aware Europe tourist spots do not offer rooms as spacious as their American equivalents might do\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The room was yet spacious enough (about 30 sqm, I guess), appearing slightly smaller perhaps owing to the high ceiling\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The room had a very comfortable bed, and all the extras you might expect from a hotel of this class: hairdryer, bathrobes, nice La Source cosmetics. When checking in, ask for a room with a canal view, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no extra charge, you might just be lucky and get a wonderful view of the canal. Because the hotel is very large, it may not be always possible to get canal view. With executive rooms, there is such an option, at least. Much seems to depend on your personal charm at check-in. Always worth trying\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 At check-in I was surprised to learn the room included breakfast, which was wonderful (eggs, sausages, mushrooms, cheeses, fitness-style, whatever you need, freshly squeezed orange juice), and also, unique to executive rooms, access to the executive lounge, which was open from the moment the breakfast room closed to eleven at night. In the executive room, you had complimentary snacks (wonderful pastries, nuts, olives) plus some wines (excellent cabernet), sparkling wine, beer, juice, mineral water. A nice touch to the hotel where drinks and food are overpriced, in my opinion (for example a Hilton burger costs 28 euros there). The first place we went to was the rooftop bar - wonderful, with excellent views, but bear in mind the pool is rather small for any serious swimming and the whole place is exposed to direct sunlight with no shade at all). All of you reserving a room at Molino Stucky must realize the hotel is located on an island, 15 minutes boat trip away from St Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s square and the like. This might be considered as a disadvantage, but for me it was an advantage, as it was nice to get away from all the tourists and spend a quite night elsewhere. The hotel boat service is free, leaving from St Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and hotel every half an hour or so, and, frankly, adds a nice touch to your stay in the place where water taxis cost more than European average cheap airline tickets. Summing up, I recommend the hotel, with one reservation that it is rather pricy even for Venice. If your budget is tight I recommend looking elsewhere. If you can find a special discounted rate (like I did getting two nights for the price of one), I strongly recommend it. For people who seek budget options, I recommend executive rooms, more expensive than the standard rooms, but worth the price considering the extras, especially access to the executive lounge (I had never before had better wines) Hope it was useful. I just wrote what I would expect to see in a review. Good Luck!

The cruise ships came so close it seemed you could touch them and the view was lovely. We didn't find it crowded at all. Check in was a snap and they had our room ready at about 11:30. The complimentary shuttle was great -- there was always room and it was like clockwork (always on time). There was a great pizza place close to the hotel so we ate outside and enjoyed dinner before walking back to the hotel. Overall, this hotel was great and I really enjoyed not being right in Venice.

At check in, the concierge indicated No. 2 would be available the next day, and she was wrong. But we made our way around with a few bumps. The location is on Giudecca Island, across a huge canal from Venice. The island is quieter than Venice (though Venice didn't seem to have much of a night life on a Sunday night either), but we liked that. The hotel shuttle worked great. We had no problems with space or timing. We couldn't find the shuttle in St. Mark's Square (man, is that place crowded or what), but the stop at Zatteras was easy to find (though not really marked that I could tell). The room was probably the largest of all 5 hotels during our stay in Italy. The bathroom was well quipped, the tv had about 6 or 7 English speaking channels. the bed was comfy. The room and public spaces were very clean. Of course, the rooftop pool and terrace rocked. What a view! We weren't up there when the food and bar service was available, but we had a nice swim and relaxed on the loungers. We didn't try room service - 26 euro for hamburger is not our style. There are a few restaurants near the hotel. If you are sick of spending so much money, there is a pizza takeaway (Facos I think) for 5 euro for a cheese pizza.

My daughter's rollaway bed was really like an army cot and not a bed. However, again the decor and cleanliness of the rooms made up for it. As for the location, it is definitely more roomier in outside space than the other San Marco located hotels where everything is tightly jammed. However, be wary of the shuttle service. The staff was hit and miss. They tried to be helpful but some staff members were certainly not at the 5 star level. You are very much tied to their schedule and if there is an event going on such as the Regatta races while we were there you could be trapped on the San Marco side for 6-7 hours with no means of transportation back to the hotel which is very frustrating. Even taxi services were not running at that time. As well, I wasn't very impressed with the restaurants on the island. We had planned to eat at Harry's Dolce (one of the famous Ciprani restaurants) and I was expecting high prices due to the name, however, I couldn't justify spending $30 on a Caprese Salad so we skipped it.

We had disembarked a Windstar yacht in the morning and had no idea that we were almost directly opposite the hotel.

On checking in we received a 1st floor executive room, the room smelled terribly of damp which we immediately refused and they moved us promptly to a fifth floor room. Considering the price of the room i was disappointed with the size i was expecting something special but it was just a normal sized room, bearing in mind we also had a small bed in there for our daughter which reduced our space considerably but the view was fantastic. On settling into our room on our second night we were unable to sleep because people moved in nextdoor and decided to unpack at 1.30 in the morning, the walls being paper thin we could hear everything and also heard they guy ask his wife if she wanted a bellini! We called reception, for them to answer 'well they have just checked in'. The next morning at 9.00 my daughter was a little upset and with our wonderful neighbours banging on the door and wall, spoiled our day.

I was charged for breakfast on the day I arrived and I arrived at 3:00PM. As I unhappily found out over the next few days, breakfast closes at 10:30AM. This was an anomaly when I reviewed my bill at the end of my stay, along with the price tripling from a 15 price per person to 45, but I thought it was rectified and happily signed the bill. But the fact that the charge reappeared on my credit card statement at the prior larger amount is contemptible. The hotels staff misrepresented the cost of everything and the amount charged to my card was clearly not what I agreed to. Now I will spend a few weeks debating this point in my broken Italian to a service staff half a world away. Second, the location is terrible. The boat ride to and from the hotel is at least 30 minutes and if you miss the boat there is a water bus, but trying to decipher the schedule and lines after enjoying a night in Venice is torture. Some vacation. Whatever energy I had mustered for the evening was routed and destroyed by the lengthy boat trip to SanMarco. Sure, its a complimentary service and thats nice. But you built the hotel on an ISLAND. Unless you are issuing flippers to guests, its somewhat of an implied service, unless you want to hold your guests ransom to the highwaymen masquerading as water taxi drivers. Also, the nearly deserted island of Guidecca (in mid August) where the hotel is situated is a terrible place in and of itself. Dont like the 10 euro coffee in the bar? Take the boat to the mainland because the nearest bar on Guidecca (besides the wonderful but exorbitant Harry's Dolci) is about a 15 minute walk. Want a snack? The cheapest thing on the menu is the 28 euro Stucky burger. I cant imagine a burger that is worth nearly 40 us dollars with service and cover, let alone the prospect of room service. Not if Ronald McDonald, Dave Thomas and the Burger King got together in some sort of anti-american monopolistic conspiracy to create the greatest burger ever could 40 dollars ever be reasonable for a burger. Lastly, as if the terrible location and deceitful staff were not enough, getting to the airport was nearly impossible. We had an early flight and after our near argument about breakfasts on days when were not in the region, we had to take 3 boats to get to the airport. We consulted with the concierge about a water taxi and that ended up being a 103 euro prospect. We were close to doing it, but the idea spending another euro as Stucky Molino's terrible geographic location was so appalling that we got up at 3AM to take the night boat to saint Mark's and then sat on the public water shuttle for an hour and a half to make our 7AM flight. Stucky Molino is a joke and easily one of the most invidious experiences of my life. Sure the pool is nice. But the obnoxious children and their parents aren't. Ya it has a western breakfast, but its not worth 45 euro. Hell its not worth 10 euro because most of the time you sit there, your waitress forgets about you and they run out of glasses, milk, orange juice and every thing else. This hotel is poorly run and exists solely because American associate the Hilton name with some level of hospitality. Dont do it. Stay on the mainland bite the bullet. Youll thank yourself for not having to make boat schedules to get back to Guidecca and youll get to enjoy the night without worry.

We also very much enjoyed the free shuttle service to Zattere and St Mark's Square which was never overcrowded as previous reviews have stated and was always on time. With our room, came access to the executive lounge - this was a great perk and we visited the lounge on several occasions to take advantage of this. On our last morning however, we were asked by a member of staff for our room number as we sat down. On giving this, we were told we were \"not on her list\". Having explained that access to the lounge was part of the deal with our room, she apologised and left us alone. We felt so uncomfortable however that we left as soon as we had finished our drinks. Interestingly, she did not appear to have any list with her and given that the executive rooms are only on one particular floor of the hotel and therefore start with a number which anyone working there would know, we were even more surprised to be challenged. We could only conclude that it was because we were considerably younger than anyone else in there at the time and therefore an easier target. Housekeeping also left a lot to be desired - on our second day, the \"housekeeping\" consisted of making the beds - the bathroom had not been touched which we know because we had left swim-wear drying and left the bathroom scales in the middle of the room and all was exactly as we left it when we returned. As part of our room package we were supposed to have a turn-down service but this did not materialise. Our night clothes were left thrown in a ball on the bed rather than being folded which was disappointing for a five star hotel and certainly not five star service. Breakfast was great and there was an immense amount of choice. The large rooms in which breakfast was served however felt a bit hangar-like and impersonal. Overall, this is a very nice hotel but the level of service is absolutely not five star sadly.

The letdowns....... the first room had a gap at the top of one of the walls to an adjoining room - could hear every word said at a whisper....privacy?! (We found out when we were woken early the following morning by children whispering and giggling) Booked a double deluxe, got a twin deluxe.....we've got children, but not with us! Breakfast generally v good - Sun was dire by any standards. No tables avail, when table made up was then occupied by other guests before we could sit down. Ended up eating a greasy spoon style leftovers breakfast (1 hour before sitting ends) 100 yards from breafast bar (possibly a blessing!) in the open air(the nice bit)!! Complementary transport - good most of the time. Some drivers were fabulous/helpful, one in particular was not ie. not waiting as we approached even though it was 5 mins early (that is until 2 Italians turned up!) We noted that other guests were unable to get on this service on a couple of occasions due to the number restricted on board. DO NOT rely on this if time is critical for connections of any sort. Spa - while this facility is very nice, it is restricted to 7 guests per half hour (yes, SEVEN). I have no idea how many guests there can be in this hotel, but catch it at the wrong time and you could possibly be waiting until your vacation next year! As it turned out, we had no problems........ Swimming pool - Small but very nice to dip in with exceptional views of Venice. With reference to the comments about the Spa, there are only about 30 sunlounger spaces available up there. It was packed on the occasions we went to lie out, so we sat on a towel on the tile floor. We were abruptly told we were not allowed to do that for a reason we could not fathom (the month didn't even have an R in it). There seems to be a tendancy for the Italians to be abrupt/rude, but we must try and not take it personally! Service - On the whole service was OK, but as I stay in hotels on a very regular basis for work, I don't expect Hiltons to be very good - they are not of the standard they used to be. If you are used to rapid, courteous service, find somewhere else! The suggestion that you have to go to the main island for everything is misleading. There is an off licence 10 mins walk from the hotel if you don't want to pay 9-10Euros for a glass of wine - that's up to you. There are also a few little restaurants/bars there too and even a supermarket if the kids are a bit fussy and want something cheap and cheerful. Frankly, I wouldn't consider taking children sub 10-12 years to Venice at all - I am glad we didn't take ours (It was only down to fate that we didn't as we have always taken them with us before - that's a story in itself!) travel/transport there is venice card to buy for 73 euros(66 for under 30's and other rates also) - this gives access to several tourist attractions, free use of many toilet facilities(euro1-50 a go otherwise) and free use of the water buses. It lasts for 3 days and includes the bus back to the airport. I would say this is v good value and can be used to structure your visit rather than sitting at a bar watching the boats drift by! Venice is a wonderful place to visit - personally, I would see it over 2-3 days.

For 75 euro, they would upgrade me to a room with a 'slightly better view'... they sent me up with a bellman to show me the room. He showed me the door. I asked whether we might be able to see the inside of the room, but he said that he couldn't, because he didn't have a key. Likely a misunderstanding compounded by my poor Italian, but strangely typical of the interesting way this hotel serves its clientele. The internet connectivity is a usurous $27E.

It's lovely, and the one truly attentive staffer at the hotel seems to be stationed there. The view of the canal and Venice is splendid.

Being on a different island is no disadvantage at all; going from rialto to san marco would also take you 5 or more minutes. It's rather an advantage since the island of giudecca is a calm oasis compared to overcrowded streets of venice. There are very nice restaurants close to the hotel (walk to right when leaving the hotel and just follow the waterfront) which offer a great view over the giudecca canal towards zattere and san marco square. The best feature of the hotel itself is the rooftop bar & pool. Nothing beats refreshing in the pool after a long day of walking in sunny venice (yes; it can be very hot in summer!). One minor disadvantage is that the pool closes relatively early; at 19.30. I read in some reviews that the hotel charges for towels or sun loungers; none of this is true (at least not when we were staying there in july 2009). Also there are free lockers available next to the pool. It can be a bit crowded at the pool area; don't expect loungers to be available at any time; but you can just put your towel on the floor and enjoy the breathtaking views over venice from the pool. There is a restaurant at the rooftop with offers overpriced ordinary snacks (hamburger for 30 EUR); you can rather eat a good lunch in the italian restaurants close to the hotel. Minibar prices are high; OK it is a 5* hotel; but the price seems just to high since the overall service level of the hotel is rather 3* than 5*. EUR 9 for a beer from the minibar seems just too much; anyways there is a supermarket on the giudecca waterfront and you can also buy cheaper drinks from many vendors in venice just before taking the boat back to the hotel. Why 3* service? The breakfast is one big chaos. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to stand in a line for 15 minutes when having breakfast at a 5* hotel. Also I would expect all food, or at least most of the food to be available; all 4 days that we had breakfast many items were not available; empty bowls and dishes were all over the buffet; many times orange juice wasn't even available for periods of 15 minutes. I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blame this on the staff as they were running around; the hotel just seems to be very badly organized and managed and just not prepared to receive large crowds. Same story for checkout; lines of 15 to 30 minutes just to be able to pay your hotel bill. OK; it was crowded; but come on; you're selling 5* service. Do I really need to wait 30 minutes in a line to pay my 9 EUR beer from the minibar? We did get a nice gift from the hotel though; in our room there was a complimentary bottle of bellini together with a letter from the hotel (addressed to a different person !!!!). There were no bathrobes in our room and we had to call three times to the MAGIC number (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what they call their customer service) before they were delivered. First call on the evening of arrival; second call on the morning after & third call on the evening of the second day. Again this is not up to the service level I would expect from a 5* hotel. Additionally there was a problem with the toilet in our room; the water didn't stop running after flushing the toilet. We notified the magic desk on our first day; they wrote it down; they would send somebody but it was never repaired. Well I didn't bother to call a second time over this. The shuttle boat offered by the hotel was a nice extra service; however its usefulness is limited as it didn't fully respect its own timetable (this was handed out by the reception upon check in) and many times was full (the maximum capacity is 40 people) and you would just be denied boarding and left stranded at the hotel. Now this is not really a problem as there are 2 vaporetto stops near the hotel (less than 5 minutes walking along the lovely waterfront of giudecca). The vaporreto runs every 5 minutes and takes you to zattere; san marco and many more places. In fact I would only recommend taking the hotelboat as it just happens to be there when you want to leave; but don't waste your time waiting for it as the vaporetto is a perfect alternative. Overal I do recommend this hotel; just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect perfect service; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location and the pool can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be beat!", "Date": "July 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGoof but not 5 star.\u201d", "Author": "PIno32", "ReviewID": "UR35791285", "Content": "Nice hotel, in good locations with excellant amenities, very clean.

The view right in front of our window was an old ruin. The hotel rooms smelt. The first room we stayed at was on the top floor. They have a pool and a bar on the roof so you can imagine the noise(be aware of top floor rooms). Furthermore, lucky us, our room was located right underneath the public bathrooms(the pool restrooms) and smelt like toilette. So after hearing the toilettes flushing about 55 times at 12 midnight we finally requested a different room. Our original room was a junior suite with venice view( cant get better than that right?) in exchange we got a regular king room and we didn't get any money or apology back. On top of all that this second room smelt like smoking cigarettes. I called the staff to the room and they agreed the room smelt like smoking cigarettes but we were told this was a \"none smoking\" room and some of the previous guests probably smoked in there and it is not hotel's fault!! and they had no other room available!! So at 12 midnight we had the choice of toilette smelling room or cigarette smoke smelling room. The AC in both rooms was not working properly either. When I got to Paris( the next part of our trip) my cloths even the ones inside my case smelt like smoke.

Showing a total lack of imagination. ABCD - really. The fact that they all interconnect on different levels and have narrow warren type corridors doesn't help the feeling of claustrophobia either. A new hotel should have been better thought out. how come you need a map to find your damn room? and the signage is so poor that I once found someone wandering through the corridors with his suitcase who had been lost for 15 minutes. OK, remember that this is a new hotel, so how come you can't get a mobile phone signal? the damn place burned out twice during restoration and you would have thought that with a shell to work from it should have been easy to ensure the relevant technology worked. How come the rooftop bar isn't open 24/7? and why haven't they tidied the disgusting mess that lies next to the hotel and ruins the view below. a small garden would have cost pennies to aquire and maintain. How come the service is so poor, Hilton generally pays its staff good wages and apparently aquired a number of top managers from throughout Venice. So why if you book a meeting with someone do they arrive 30 minutes late? perhaps they get lost in this nightmare too. How come the lifts are inadequate (a friend of mine was in a lift that fell four floors - in a new hotel). This is poor to say the very least. perhaps maintenance isn't up to scratch either. About the only plus is the rooftop swimming pool, which despite being tiny, does have good views. Get there early as there are very few loungers and you have to hire towels. Shocking considering the prices of the rooms. last but not least, if you are going to book Venice then stay \"in Venice\". The Molino is on the Giudecca, which means transfers to and from the main islands. Fun at first them irritating to say the very least.

Being a 5 Star, I would expect someone to assist with the luggage, and welcome us on the dock, but no such luck. It cost about 30 Euros for two of us (One Way). It's a lot more expensive to travel on a private boat. Check In was not friendly.... the German Girl at the desk could not crack a smile to save herself, and her supervisor was not much help either. The hotel was full, and to schedule one person on the desk....and 3x Concierge... someone obviously does not know how to run a Front Office. She could not help me with any of my questions, and was not very accomodating...but finally I got a room at the Front of the hotel looking out over the Canal. I asked for a particular room type,...but they said they were full. I know this was not the case as they were still selling on Priceline and Expedia and as I work in the industry, I know these cheaper rates are available to get last minute bookings. The Hotel is amazing! The lobby is very grand, and romantic and great if you are looking to impress. I was there to propose to my girlfriend,...but don't expect the hotel to go out of their way to help make it a memory for you. I wanted to propose on the roof top, and had notified the hotel prior, but they close the pool area at 6pm, and the rest of the roof was for a private art party. (Generally in hotels... public areas are not used for Private Functions). The F&B is very expensive... I brought a beer and a bottle of water and it cost 17 Euros... I had to laugh at the Rip-Off. They could have at least showed a little service, or brought it over to me and my GirlFriend who were sitting down. On a good note,.... the Hotel is amazing...I mean,... it is truely 5-Star in Looks...and the Rooms are very nice with Old Wood Beam ceilings....truely very luxury, and I have stayed at many many 5 Star Hotels before. The breakfast was very good, and the F&B staff were very professional and welcoming. They have a huge buffey for 30 Euro's for two people...which is fair as far as North American standards would go. I would stay again...but purely only for the hotel....and not the staff. They really need a Front Office Manager who can motivate, stimulate, and engage their staff. Just because I had booked on Priceline didn't mean I needed to be treated poorly. I was stil paying $250 USD per night. I would recommend it, provided you can look past the Desk Staff Service. The Concierge were very good!...but reluctant to help with luggage. I watched on let a bag fall into a guest, and then argue with another staff member, but the other two were good.

Being a Hilton brand, I knew it would be a nice hotel - however, I had no idea it would be so absolutely incredible. The building itself is amazing - it's an old renovated flour mill that has been creatively restored and transformed into this gorgeous modern hotel. So, as you're walking through the hotel, parts are very luxurious and modern, and other parts feel like a medieval Venetian fortress. Hilton has done a wonderful job of maintaining the historical aspect of this 13-building compound, while allowing all of the luxuries of a 5 star hotel. My room was on the 7th (top) floor, and I had an absolutely incredible view out my bathroom and bedroom windows of Venice and the Guidecca canal. The room itself was gorgeous - Victorian style decoration, huge comfortable bed, tall ceilings, beautiful chandelier, lovely Venetian photographs adorning the walls, and the usual amenities you'd expect in a Hilton hotel; flat screen TV, work desk with high speed Internet, etc. I especially enjoyed the \"welcome\" letter signed by the manager of the hotel and the box of Venetian chocolates that were waiting for me on the table when I first walked into my room. What a wonderful, personal touch! I can also gush on and on about the bathroom - wow was it gorgeous! It had a bathtub with 2 windows that looked out over Venice, a glass shower, toilet and bidet, beautiful sink, tile and fixtures, and fuzzy robe and wall heater to warm the towels. Another fabulous feature of this hotel was the rooftop bar, which offered incredible views over Venice at sunset. There is also an amazing pool in the rooftop, with plush lounge chairs on the sundeck, and even a lifeguard. As one of the tallest buildings in Venice, the views from this hotel were fabulous. We had the breakfast buffet, which was very pricey, but had an amazing assortment of fruits, breads, meats, cheeses, etc. I think some room rates may include breakfast, but ours did not. The food was amazing, but I'm not sure the price was worth it. The staff overall were amazing - true to Hilton standards as far as quality of service, helpfulness and courtesy. The only downside to this hotel is that it is on Guidecca islan, which is across the Guidecca canal from the main part of Venice where most of the attractions are. The hotel does offer a courtesty boat/shuttle from the dock directly in front of the main door of the hotel, across to the water-bus stop of Zattere and on to the Piazza San Marco stop, but the timetables did not always work for us. Twice we had to take the water-bus to another stop on Guidecca island and walk to the hotel. It's good to allow plenty of time to get around Venice; boats take a long time with the slow speed they are required to travel, and boat/shuttle times may not always mesh with your schedule. Otherwise, this is an incredible hotel.

The breakfast was excellent (though I probably wouldn't have paid for it, were it not included), with a wide selection of fruit, pastries, and made-to-order egg dishes. I might have liked to see more hot dishes, but no big deal. The lounge (for Hilton Gold and Platinum members, or those staying on the executive floor) was a small section of the bar. So it wasn't as nice as the usual Hilton lounge, though it did have some decent snacks. I tried to find out what happened to the real lounge, but didn't get a straight answer. We actually walked through the real lounge (it's still there and the doors were open, but empty of people and staff). As for internet, it's not included and shockingly expensive.

Let me warn everyone that one side of the hotel faces a construction pit complete with construction equipment and noise. It you stand facing Venice and the hotel is behind you, then it is the side of the building on your right. We are Hilton Diamond Members and used points for our stay. Check in went smoothly. We learned that we were upgraded to a suite (guess what side of the building it was on), had complimentary breakfast and access to the executive lounge for evening appetizers. Arrived at our room and opened the curtains to reveal the view and accompanying noise directly below our fourth floor window. Immediately we decided the room was not for us because of the noise and the view. Now we knew why we were upgraded to the suite. Within five minutes we were back at the front desk to ask them to change our room and were informed there wasn't another room available. Not one single room was available. I guess none of the other guests wanted to stay in that room either. We made our reservation back in January and they must have been holding this peaceful room with a wonderful view specifically for us--only for us loyal diamond members. Shame on you Hilton for treating loyal customers that way. When we complained and asked to speak to the manager, the front desk clerk called for security. Talk about intimidation. Talk about customer service. Shame on you for putting us in this uncomfortable position. At that point about seven other individuals came to the front desk to see what all the commotion was about . One of these individuals we concluded was someone in authority and she proceeded to assist us. She informed us that she could provide us with a standard room overlooking Venice but it would not be a suite. It took us all of a nanosecond to decide that this room would be fine. She took us to the room to get our approval and it was fine and the view was fine and it was quiet. That is all that we wanted. Shame on you for not giving us this choice in the beginning. When we looked back on the experience, we concluded that they threw in all the comps so that we wouldn't complain about the location of the suite. What they should have done when we checked in was give us the option of a suite overlooking the construction site or give us a standard room overlooking Venice. They should have let us check out the suite and then let them know our decision. This approach could have avoided the subsequent scene at the front desk where we were told there were no more rooms. The blame rests solely on the General Manager for condoning this type of behavior and leading hotel guest to believe that it is that room or no other room. I thought to myself about the other guests who checked in later that day. If there were no more rooms for us to switch to, then where did they stay. By the way, to smooth things over, they delivered a bottle of Bellini to our room with a welcome note. Ironically we don't drink. Aside from the initial room assignment, everything else about the hotel was fine and I would recommend it to anyone as long as they aren't on the construction side of the building. It is unfortunate that we had to be put through the experience of insensitive personnel at the Molino Stucky Hilton and I want to alert others so that they don't have the same experience that we did.

The hotel complex is very big and new. The rooms were clean, offered a good amount of space, and the bathroom was very spacious. Our room was located in the front of the hotel (although the hotel tried to take me out of the room even though I\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcm a HiltonHonors member) so we had a view of the main waterway and Venice. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat at the hotel but we did go to the SkyBar twice for a drink and that was a good spot to start the night. For your stay if your looking for a newer hotel in Venice with bars and places to eat this would be a good choice. If you want the smaller European hotel atmosphere with the free breakfast you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll want to stay somewhere else. I called ahead to find out how to get to the hotel as we were arriving by train. The hotel told me to get on public water taxi #41 and get off at the 4th stop (Palanca). Once we got off the water taxi the hotel was a 5 minute walk away. Now, we had to wait 20 minutes for the water taxi at the train station on a crowded dock, when the water taxi came it was over crowded with people, we have all our luggage, once we get off the water taxi we had to walk about a \u00c2\u00bd mile to the hotel with our luggage , and the walk to the hotel included two bridges. I would recommend hiring a private water taxi as these boats dock right at the hotel, but you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need to spend extra euros for this. The convenience of the private water taxi should be worth the extra money. I hired a private water taxi the day we left and for 100 Euro the taxi takes you directly to the airport, about a 40 minute boat ride. It is impossible to get coffee in the hotel unless you order the very expensive room service. We ordered room service one morning just to get coffee and they charged an 8 Euro delivery fee. The total bill was 35 Euro for a continental breakfast with coffee. The hotel water taxi was fine but you are on their schedule. We walked to St. Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one day and we decided to take the Hilton water taxi back to the hotel from that point. The funny thing was the Hilton dock wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t identified for the us and we actually had to follow the boat as it was coming over in the water to find the dock. We weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only guests of the hotel watching to see where the boat was going to dock. Some of the staff was very friendly and helpful but others just not as friendly.

But the room did include an assortment of hot tea every morning, which was lovely. I really liked the building, and the inside was so lovely. The shower was definitely a bit crammed, and very narrow. We did discover, on our second to last day, that there was a wonderful spa with a jacuzzi and very very unique steam room (go check out the steam room when you're there....so cool!), and a refreshment lounge that was very relaxing after a long day of walking. Take advantage of the spa area. The free shuttle was nice, and used just enough. One thing I wasn't expecting, from Venice, was how rude the Italians are. Maybe it's just a cultural thing, or maybe they truly are sick of all the tourists, but I was so shocked at how incredibly rude (by American standards) the people are. There is no customer service, and no one smiles. I was looking like a fool, walking around, smiling to everyone. Haha, I guess you just don't smile in Venice. We spent 3 nights at the Hilton, and honestly, we were ready to get out of there (not because of the Hilton, but just because of Venice in general). We went on to much nicer parts of Italy (Cinque Terre, and Florence). 1 or 2 nights in Venice is plenty. Really. Someone told me that, and I didn't believe them--but it's true. But I would definitely recommend staying at the Hilton. The views are incredible if you get a Venice view--you can even see the Swiss Alps! One complaint I have about the hotel, is that even though it was freezing in Venice when we went, the hallways out side of our room were always blazing hot. Right when we got out of the elevator, it was like humid and warm. Really weird. But didn't feel like that in our room ever. Just something little to complain about.

Room: It was really spacious and had flat screen TV and all the amenities one expects at this category. The bathroom was spacious and well stocked with Evenly and Crabtree toiletries. Beds and pillow were comfortable. However, I had a real grip with the bed size. We had two beds in the room. The beds were extremely small. The hotel claimed they were twin size. I did not think so. It was so small that I was afraid to fall onto the floor during the night. I have a rather small frame 1.70 meter in height and 60kg.

We arrived late on Christmas Eve for a 3 night stay, and it was surreal to be just two of a very small number in such a large complex. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff on duty over Christmas, and our first floor room overlooking the Giudecca Channel was absolutely perfect. Had we been staying for longer than three nights the amount of hanging space in the surprisingly small wardrobe might have been an issue. The carpet in our room was also a little grubby, and again, it was a surprise that a hard floor material had not been used in construction instead of carpet. The marble floor in the bathroom was beautiful. The shower area in the bath was a little small but, it's not a major issue, and the water flow and temperature were perfect. All the food we were served was top class, although a little short on quantity, the fillet steak probably the most tender we have ever experienced, truly melt-in-the-mouth. The shuttle boat was always on time and was well run, and if we wanted to go somewhere outside the shuttle timetable there is a handy vaperetto stop just five minutes walk away. In summary, we had a fantastic time, the staff were superb, the food excellent and above all the hotel itself is another reason for visiting Venice, if any more are needed. Our only real gripe? The price of the food and drinks is quite frankly exorbitant. The 1:1 exchange rate of Euro to GBP means that a bottle of Nastro beer is \u00c2\u00a38, and a bottle of water from the minibar is \u00c2\u00a36. The cheapest wine on the menu is \u00c2\u00a339.

Taking the water taxi is the easiest, but will set you back 50 Euro. The hotel is a very nice property. The staff, for the most part, was not so great. The door men were very pleasant, but the desk people and the \"Executive Lounge Host\" were a different story. I paid for a premium room with a view. I am also a Diamond member which I hoped would guarantee my request. So, I was told I was upgraded to a \"Suite with a wonderful view\". I was happy to hear that everything was going as expected. I have read, in previous posts, to be careful about the view because their idea of a view may be different than yours. So we get into our room to be accosted with a terrible view! I would prefer no window at all. Please see attached picture. I called the front desk and asked to be moved to a different room, but was told it was \"not possible\". This was in late November and this is a large hotel. Even yet, I was firmly told that a nicer room was not possible. I said I didn't care about the suite, just give me a room with any other view. It was not possible. I can't tell you how disappointed I was. When looking at the pictures, please keep in mind that many people pay a much higher rate for this \"Suite\". Beware. The room itself was nice, but there was not enough hot water to take a normal shower. I called to remedy this issue, but was informed that it was \"not possible\". Very strange. As far as the \"Executive Lounge\", it is a joke. It took us 2 days to realize that it is not located on the top floor, as the staff and signs would lead you to believe, but it is actually in the normal lounge. It is a row of tables in the bar. The lady in charge of this section is easily unlikeable. Her attitude was more of a prison guard than a helpful guest attendant. She scorned some poor older lady for dropping a glass and breaking it and mumbled something about a bill. We were told that we cannot bring food into the \"Executive Lounge\" from the bar, yet the day before we did. The next day others were as well. There is no real separation from the regular lounge and the Exec Lounge, which is not an issue for me, but why can't I eat a burger at one table and not the table next over? Ridiculous! There is no sense of order in this matter and the lady in charge makes it even more frustrating. The free shuttle is a god send, because without it, you are pretty much stranded. The boat captain is very nice and prompt. The hotel will lead you to believe there are no shops or food to be had on the island. Don't believe them! Our last day, we finally made a short trip around the island and found 2 pharmacies, 2+ restaurants, and a grocery store! Good to know because the food prices at the Hilton are even more expensive than usual Hilton fare. If you are one to wake up and go out strolling around the city, make a pit stop back at the room to freshen up or take a nap, and then head out again for more sights, this location will cramp your style. It is not very convenient. You will need to plan your activities around the shuttle service. All in all, the place is nice and the rooms are small, new, and nice.

The room is very nice, decorated in a melon color and dark wood. The bathroom in marble, with a shower and a tub, a vanity and a bidet. The room had a nice, large, flat screen TV (we were there during the US election), large desk, table and chairs and a safe in the closet. There were small drawers in the closet as well. There was also an electric tea pot if you wanted tea. If there was anything to complain about the room, it would be the stained carpet. The hotel is located on the island of Giudecca, but they offer a free shuttle that ran from 0800-2350 while we were there, it may run later in the summer. It left the hotel at :00 and :40 every hour.

The buffet had pastries, sliced meat and cheese, fruit, cereal, and hot items: eggs, potatoes, ham, and tomatoes. The ham was delicious!

It transpired that the walls were wooden and they acknowledged that there were problems in that building. Why they put a family with 2 children in such rooms is surprising, especially as they were not full, and were able to relocate us immediately. Another problem with the room was that cigarette smoke was blowing into it via the air conditioning, on a non-smoking floor.

Not a lot of restaurants though - although there is a Harry's bar outpost 5 minutes away, if you are ok paying 42 Euros for a plate of pasta.... Rooms: I had a great corner room on the fourth floor with views across the main waterway towards classical Venice. Not spacious by North American standards but given a) it's an old mill and b) European hotel rooms are big on comfort, if not space, it was just fine. Water pressure in shower just the right side of ok. But it's the first room I've stayed in where you get eye to eye with the main deck of a cruise liner as it goes past your window. Do remember to close your blinds! Facilities: an amazing rooftop bar and (small) pool. Stunning views across the lagoon. Even if you don't stay here, it's worth a visit for those views. Public spaces were spacious, airy and hard to fault. Food and drink: yes, it's pricey. 8 euros for a beer and I gather breakfast is the best part of 40 euros. So either be disciplined and get your breakfast in a cafe or take your credit card. The breakfast was excellent quality - very fresh food. Staff: I found the staff charming and very friendly. Even a please and thank you in Italian went some way and they did speak faultless English. I know that some of my colleagues found there wasn't a great sense of urgency for small but important requests - eg an iron early evening to press a shirt or blouse ...and still don't understand why chain hotels like the Hilton don't provide irons and boards as standard. But all my experiences were very positive. They were also keen to go the extra mile for simple requests that were directly within their control.

Upon arriving at the hotel first impressions where amazing. It is massive and extremely impressive looking and right on the waters edge. The impressions did not change when entering. The hotel is extermely attractive and drapped in marble. The reception/checking in was very efficient. Our room was lovely. It had a side view which looked over a side canal which was fine. Our room was a very good sixe with a hugo double bed plenty or wardrobe space, safe, flat screen TV and a lovely bathroom which was plenty big enough. Upon exploring the hotel we found 4/5 very lovely look restaurants which lived up to their impressions as the food was amazing, We chose to eat in our hotel for both our evening meals and where not disappointed. Breakfast is amazing as well with so much choice and as we had breakfast included with our room you could basically eat as much as you like. The hotel offer a FREE shuttle boat which takes you to main land venice. It take 5 minutes to get straight across the water and 10/15 minutes to get to St Mark's square. The boat ran on time every time and was incredibly easy to use and a great novelty. You are offerered a time table at check-in and the boat runs late into the evening so no problems with getting back to the hotel. Hotel has a swimming pool which is a lovely extra. It is roof top and a good size. There are only a few sunbeds which you do have to pay for but we had no problmes just laying our towels down on the floor instead which is of course FREE. We used the pool each day we where there and was a lovely way to cool down in the summer sun. We also used the spa/gym facility which was also lovely and a nice way to spend an hour or so relaxing. We decided against any treatments as they did seem a little on the expensive side but you can use the other facilities for FREE. Over all wethroughly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend it.

No view but here are the benefits, a large comfy bed (the comfiest ever slept in), two large wardrobes, a large flat screen tv, slippers and bathrobe, good air conditioning, a marble bathroom with bidet, sink, bath with lovely shower over, very nice crabtree and evelyn products, lots of fluffy soft white towells. The room and bathroom, carpets, furnishings all clean, modern, new and to a very high standard. The room and bathroom were kept immaculate throughout our stay as was the whole hotel. Best of all there was no noise at all, the walls seemed very thick so nothing could be heard from other rooms. We dined in the hotel IL Molino restaurant outside on our first evening and the food was excellent as was the service. The second evening we had our best meal of our stay in Venice at the hotel Aromi restaurant. Again the food, service, ambiance was excellent. We dined inside due to weather but on warmer evenings there is a lovely terrace to dine near the canal with beautiful views. The breakfasts served in the Il Molino restaurant were again excellent with so much choice and variety catering for all nationalities. A highlight for us was being able to return from the husstle and bustle of Venice to such a beautiful hotel. We used the roof top pool and sun loungers. From here the views of Venice and the cruise ships sailing by is stunning. Another bonus is the Skyline terrace bar which serves excellent cocktails till late evening, a beautiful place to watch the sun go down and again excellent service. The hotel runs a free shuttle service from the hotel to Zattere and St Marks Square (15mins) throughout the day till evening. This is an excellent service. I was a little concerned with booking a hotel not on the main land however when we had seen the hotel and its excellent facilities plus the ease of taking the shuttle we were so glad we had chosen the Hilton. We were a little disappointed with our meal on our 3rd evening in Venice near the Rialto Bridge. The quality was not up to the standard of the other meals we ate at the hotel. Perhaps we should have enquired with the concierge for recommendations. This hotel definately has the wow factor all areas are immaculate and decorated to high standards. Service form all staff was excellent. I would definately return Venice is a beautiful city, we enjoyed our stay here so much and as a travel agent of 15 years I will definately recommend to others.

We thought the hotel was excellent. I suspect the previous reviewer has hit the nail on the head - if you book through Priceline (or similar) you get one of the smaller rooms. We chose to book on the Hilton website and we were allocated a very nice room overlooking the front of the hotel. Maybe the rooms aren't as luxurious as say a Four Seasons or as sophisticated as a Rocco Forte hotel but then you're not paying Four Seasons prices (even when booking on the Hilton website). We found the staff to be charming, friendly and helpful. Every request we made of the hotel (from room service and housekeeping to the front desk and concierge) was met with efficiency and a smile. The hotel shuttle boat to the Piazza San Marco is a real treat each day and we were able to come and go as we pleased by using either the hotel shuttle or the vaporetto (which is a real plus as the main island becomes incredibly crowded and congested during the day.) If you can, try and get a room in the Arsenale at the front of the hotel overlooking the main waterway (not the side canal). Yes there are problems with noise intrusion in these rooms (which Hilton needs to take a serious look at improving) but then that's part and parcel of staying in a converted flour mill with wooden floors, open beamed ceilings and cast iron columns. Not your standard Hilton! Food and drink at the hotel are expensive but there are cheaper options a few minutes stroll away. If you fancy a simple pasta dish or salad with a glass of wine head for the little cafe on the waterfront just beyond the Palanca zaporetto stop - great for lunch or just a drink. We also followed a previous reviewers recommendation and tried the Ristorante San Trovaso just a few minutes walk from the Zattere hilton shuttle boat stop - great for dinner with food and drinks less than half the price charged in the hotel. The Hilton has a fantastic rooftop pool and indoor spa with a good range of treatments. As previously mentioned the rooftop bar has stunning views - a real must for a chilled glass of prosecco.

A good thing - those who have lounge access can also enjoy a \"full breakfast\" at the Hotel's restaurant for free. The staff was extremely friendly and accomodating.

Yes... I purchased my room via Priceline, as I'm sure many others have as well. Including all taxes my `1 night stay was just under $275 USD for a single night, and a pretty good deal even compared with average 3 star hotels. If you are considering this hotel and are planning on using Priceline (other websites indicate that the Molino Stucky is generally available to those who bid for Venice 5 Stars) you should know that the hotel seems to have 2 classes of rooms. I noticed that on the service carts (parked in the halls) that even the shampoo comes in 2 sizes... the regular Hilton size and a more deluxe large size (I suppose for the \"Real 5 Star Rooms\" As a Priceline customer.. I never expect a \"room with a view\" (hey, but it happens) But there seems to be an extreme difference between in size (room and/or shampoo) between the lowest class and the average class of rooms. In short... the non view rooms are TINY and if you read all the reviews you'll find others who have negative comments about the hotels rooms If you buy via Priceline... don't expect most of the 5 Star Reviews to be relevant to your stay. Yes its beautiful, very luxe, but I've never heard of a 5 Star expereince where the room was more or less a \"Shoe Box\" I was LUCKY... I got one of the few \"Shoe Boxes\" with a view, I doubt if there are many of them to be had. If your looking for value....you need to consider that there does not seem to be a single pay phone on the whole island...this Molino Stucky is the only hotel I've ever seen that does not have a single pay phone. Oh and the food.... don't even think about eating at the Molino Stucky... just read the other reviews. But a short walk along the water there are a few places that were far more reasonable than on the main island, filled with locals and to be honest.... the highlights of our stay. In my opinion these few restaurants are the only reason to visit the isalnd..... I'd suggest you stay on the main island and then with your water bus pass, visit and have a meal. As an example, our breakfast was 3 Euro for 2 people...total. Also its far easier to reach the hotel using the water bus and walking a quarter mile with your luggage than dealing with the Hilton's free launch.... where you need to carry your luggage down into the boat vs. rolling on and off the water bus.

I called the \"Magic\" customer service and asked \"how much to make a local call?\" and I was told \"1 Euro\" probably higher than a pay phone... but since none are available why not?..... at check out my 5 calls were charged at 27 Euro (seems its a Euro a minute) I declined to pay the 22 Euro difference and was told that I was \"difficult\" at some point I was offered (since I was difficult\" the opportunity to split the difference and pay 50%... I stood firm and finally paid the 5 Euro after explaining that I had a cell phone that costs me $.099 USD per minute.... why whould I choose to pay the Hilton the equiv. of $1.60 per minute for a call? Make sense to you? Anyway I was shocked to be told that I was difficult and then very difficult. In closing.. its pretty, unique, but lacks charm Many other reviewers seem to concur about the staff I wouldn't care to say here again, even if it was free.

Our particular room had an odd musty odor that must be a result of the high humidity. Go figure, that in Venice, there is a lot of humidity...LOL. Must have to do with all of the canals and water. The main spaces on the reception level were not Air Conditioned, so watching the Euro 2008 Semi Finals at the Rialto Bar was a little uncomfortable.

It's a long space with enclaves or private areas partioned so that groups of 4-6 can hang out in some sense of privacy. The pool is small and the water warms up fast with the sun, but the location (on top of the hotel) provides breath-taking views. The breeze up there will help you cool off once you take a dip in the pool. The pool bar is also extremely nice and provides some exceptional views.

A couple of brief observations: *The Hotel is beautiful and perfectly situated. *The rooms are a good size (for American standards) and have good working \"western\" bathrooms. *The Rooftop Bar is amazing and has incredible views of Venice. *The food is expensive in the hotel. *The hotel management is accommodating and willing to work with you if you have a special request. I had read previously on this site that the food in the hotel is very expensive... and it is... 30 Euros for the breakfast buffet. As a pretty savy business traveler and a member of Hilton Honors, I asked if we could upgrade our standard deluxe room to the Executive Level... knowing that the Lounge probably included Continental Breakfast and evening Hors d'oeuvres. To our good fortune, the manager accommodated us and we paid an additional 45Euros for an \"upgraded room\" and we were put on the Executive Level with the perks that come with it. We had an afternoon snack, and what amounted to dinner, along with continental breakfast the following morning for two people. The food was plentiful and more than above average and cocktails were complimentary! One thing also worth mentioning is that the vapretto comes right to the hotel... so if you have physical issues with handling lugguge over several canals or need extra assistance with a lot of baggage, I would definitely recommend this hotel.

Also, since cell phones are apparently not permitted in the public areas of the hotel (a plus for most guests, if this is truly their policy), it meant that cell phone users were stepping into \"our\" courtyard to make their calls - we were treated to one-sided conversations in a variety of languages at all hours of the day and night.

However, the Molino Stucky Hilton, a late 1800s industrial flour mill sitting in a quiet location off the beaten track (the Giudecca island, also home to the historic Cipriani hotel) yet minutes by boat from anywhere in Venice, beautifully renovated as a hotel by the Caltagirone group and opened with great fanfare under Hilton management in 2007, manages to disappoint on so many counts that at some point I started keeping a list. Call me a snob, call me someone who can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appreciate the fine things in life, but here are seven ways a hotel can go wrong \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and at the Molino Stucky Hilton, all seven are wrong. 7. Internet access, provided by Swisscom, is fast and reliable but offered at extortionary prices. Business packages are 24 hours for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac27 or 7 days for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac108; if you choose Economy access (bandwidth and data volume limitations apply), you can choose between 60 non-consecutive minutes within a 24-hour range for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac12 or 24 consecutive hours for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac22. During a three-night stay, I burned through three of the sixty-minute packages \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I hardly ever used the full hour, mind you, which only left me the added frustration of not being able to carry any unused minutes over to the next day. 6. There is no turndown service for the night, unless on request. And even on request, there is hardly any turndown service \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it mostly consists of the removal of some pillows to a chair or a closet, depending on the housekeeping whim of the day. Drapes were left open for us to remember closing on our own. For rooms that set you back between \u00e2\u201a\u00ac400 and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac700 per night (but you can also choose a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3,700 Tower Suite, should you be so inclined), I find it in extraordinary bad taste not to provide turndown service by default. 5. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m all for the environment, and in principle I do sympathize with the effort to conserve water and not dump synthetic detergents into the Venice Lagoon. Yet, for the aforementioned \u00e2\u201a\u00ac400 to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac700 per night, I expect to have the option to keep the same sheets night after night, should I so desire, by placing a little green card that says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m green, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change my sheets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on my bed before leaving the room in the morning. I do not expect the default option to be that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to sleep in clammy sheets, unless I remember to place on my bed the little green card that says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m just not that into green, so do bother to change my sheets, please\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That is precisely the unpalatable choice that the Hilton management inflicts on any morally conflicted guests at one of its most hyped luxury locations, and probably elsewhere too, considering how much cheaper it is. 4. Suites and junior suites come with complimentary access to an Executive Lounge on the sixth floor. On inspection, however, this turns out to be a singularly depressing space, dimly lit with minimal amounts of natural light coming from gunholes on top of the walls, and reminiscent most of all of a narrow airport lounge at some minor hub. An inexplicably undrinkable orange juice is served, and Sunday newspapers only appear on Sunday morning only after reminding the lounge staff that Sunday is, indeed, a day of the week when many newspapers are regularly published. 3. A beautiful swimming pool on the seventh floor of the building is surrounded by such precious few deckchairs that, on a sunny afternoon, guests start getting turned away. This may be indeed a structural limitation, yet it is not one that the hotel designers couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t foresee. Another rooftop solarium, perhaps? Deckchairs in the garden? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only May and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re running the pool at full capacity \u00e2\u20ac\u201c how many guests are you going to disappoint by July? 2. Ah, no pool, but at least one can get up in the morning and go to the state-of-the-art-gym for a good workout, right? (Remember the open drapes issue above \u00e2\u20ac\u201c item 6. \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the fact that the sun does rise at a very early hour these days, especially for a weekend morning). Most people who work out are used to getting their workouts sometime between 6 and 8 am, right? Well, no such luck. The gym, which is described in the in-room Guest Services book as opening at 8 am, really doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t open until 9 am. Guests who show up in workout gear anytime before 9 are turned away. 1. Finally, the staff is spectacularly untrained and occasionally clueless. (With a notable exception at the spa, the only department where people were competent, experienced and friendly: if you need a beautician, ask for Ella). Almost everybody looked like they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d just shown up for their first day of work. A request for Earl Grey tea at the aforementioned Executive Lounge (item 4.) was met with an uncomprehending stare and two consecutive attempts at tea that were not Earl Grey. A pool attendant (5.), asked whether there might be a house phone nearby, gleefully answered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have no clue\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Lapses in training, even at a hotel costing you the aforementioned number of Euros per night, can be forgiven; lapses in attitude will poison the guest experience to the point that a guest will only return under extreme duress. (For a well-thought-out philosophy of the hospitality business, I recommend Setting the Table by New York restaurateur Danny Meyer). Of course the Molino Stucky Hilton is not a boutique hotel. But still, one would wish to enjoy some glimpses of good service, and good management, even when staying at a bigger place.

As mentioned in previous reviews, if you like to be away from the hussle and bustle, and don't mind having to take a 20 min boat ride to and from St Marks Square then this hotel is ideal. We didn't find this a problem since the boats ran all day and were always on time. We had originally booked (via Hilton website) a deluxe room with breakfast included in the rate, and upon arrival we were upgraded to an executive room with access to the lounge. We regret taking the upgrade because we ended up with a room which we felt was smaller than what we originally booked, and the view out of the window was onto the staircase of the adjacent spa. Apart from the view, the room was clean, modern and of high standard of fittings, complete with a 5 piece bathroom suite with marble tiles. The lounge was dark with no windows, there was no free internet access or toilets within the vicinity. We only used it once during our stay. This was quite disappointing since we have had access to Hilton lounges in the past and this one wasn't the best.

I spent hours online looking for the best quality accommodation for the high prices we would be paying. I was surprised that the 5 star deluxe hotels (according to the guidebooks) are not very well reviewed here on Tripadvisor (Gritti, Danieli). Also, rates vary widely depending on which website you book through, so do your research. We ultimately booked an accommodation package at the new 5-star Ca'Sagredo for 4 of our 5 nights in Venice through Luxurylink.com. We still needed a hotel for our first night in Venice though (a Saturday), and since we were arriving late we did not want to spend another 450 Euros to add an extra night at the Ca'Sagredo. After a lot of online searching, we ended up booking a night at the Hilton Molino Stucky through Priceline for the incredible rate of $147 US. It almost seemed too good to be true. We were worried we'd end up in a broom closet! Getting to the hotel is rather easy. We were in no hurry to check in, so we took the Alilaguna (12 Euros each) to the Zattere stop (1 hour, 20 minutes), and then caught the Hilton's shuttle (it arrived within 15 minutes and took about 5 minutes to cross the canal). Check-in was quick and efficient. The front desk clerk was very pleasant, and no mention of Priceline was made (paying such a low rate for the room I was wondering if we would be treated as second class citizens - we weren't). As expected, our room (227 in the Arsenale wing) didn't have much of a view (interior courtyard), but that didn't matter to us as we were checking in after dark and leaving the next day. The room was richly appointed and a good size (but not huge). The bed had already been turned down for us, and there were robes and slippers available for our use. The furnishings and linens were of an excellent quality - certainly the plushest Hilton we've ever stayed in. The bathroom was especially nice, with a separate shower, heated towel rack and Crabtree & Evelyn toiletries. After dropping our bags and freshening up we headed upstairs to the rooftop lounge, where we had a couple glasses of prosecco to toast the beginning of our holiday. This is probably one of the nicest hotel bars I've ever seen. The atmosphere is clubby but subdued, the service is friendly and efficient, and there's a terrific view across the canal to Venice proper. There were dozens of candles lit around the bar and pots of citronella were lit up on the terrace (although it was a little cold for sitting outside). Our drinks were served with complimentary nuts and a fruit platter (which was quickly replenished after we made short work of the first offering!) We then headed down to the lobby restaurant to have a light dinner. Again the service was excellent. The food was expensive (as is almost everything in Venice), but it was nice to enjoy a meal while watching elegant Italians milling about in their finery (attendees of a yachting gala in the hotel's ballroom). We skipped the 40-Euro brunch the next morning, but it looked tempting... I would definitely recommend this hotel as a summertime option in Venice. The rooftop pool and the hotel's removal from Venice proper would provide a welcome respite from the heat and crowds of the peak season. Off season, waiting for a shuttle to take you back and forth to the main island might be a little inconvenient if you wanted to go back to the hotel for a mid-afternoon nap, etc. However, for the price we paid I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hesitate to stay there at any time of the year!

We eventually found the shuttle at the S Zaccharia vaporetto stop(which is the stop afterValaresso!) Get the No 1 Vaporetto straight to S Zaccharia- there Hilton how hard was that! There was a notice which seemed to suggest that the shuttle was alongside the stop but when we went down that path we were sent to the vaporetto waiting room where we sat for half an hour. When the shuttle eventually arrive everyone surged down our original path and pushed on in front of us!! Manouvering through the crush with suitcases would be impossible with any sort of disability or small children and no help was offered or given The hotel doesnt have an obvious main entrance (presumably planning issues) and seemed to be having problems with its front doors in the wind. One was cracked and broken on our arrival- two more were damaged whilst we were there- (not our fault!)-they slam shut in the wind ! The check in was efficient and we were directed to our room with our bags. No porter was offered. We were on the 7th floor and although the view toward St marks Square was lovely and the room itself very pleasant there was a couple of problems. The first was that only one of the two (very small) available lifts was working for our entire stay, even on New Years Eve when there was a large function booked into the Sky Bar above us (at 450 Euro a person!!!!!!). There is a wonderful view from the Sky Bar terrace but only when it is open. Otherwise you cant see anything. The lift was constantly full of people going up to the top and then coming straight back down because it was shut. On more than one occasion we used the stairs because it was impossible to get into the lift! Obviously the second lift need to be in working order but a notice on the ground floor to say that the terrace was shut would have saved countless wasted trips- there Hilton how hard was that! The noise level in our room was ridiculous. The roof bar has a tiled floor so we could hear the clicking of high heels and the dragging of furniture. There was a service staircase next to us which they used to clear the empties at the end of the evening which was also very loud. We didn't complain because otherwise all was fine and we're such night owls that it was usually winding down be the time it mattered! New Years Eve was a different matter We went to bed at two but the music sounded as if it was playing in our room! We stuck it out till 3.00 when we phoned down to ask what time it was finishing and were told 4.30!!!!! We were offered a room change but couldnt really cope with it in the middle of the night and to be fair the music did quiet down a lot shortly afterwards. I dread to think what the noise would be like when the pool and its terrace are open but meanwhile there is a nightclub on the bar at weekends. Do not stay on the floor beneath unless you will be attending it-there Hilton- how hard is that!! A lot of other problems were caused by the staff levels being too low. Breakfast is fine but everything runs out very quickly and not everything was replenished. We didn't get tea at breakfast for the first two mornings because the waiter couldn't find any! On lunchtime we waited so long to be served in the bar that we gave up and our room was twice being made up when we returned at 4.30 in the afternoon. There was also a complete lack of 'service'. We had a water shuttle timetable for the first three days but on the fourth it changed! We were left to dicover the new times and new routes for ourselves.It isn't asking too much that new ones could have been handed out on the shuttle the previoius day, made available at breakfast or been put into rooms the night before.

However, i would agree 100% with the previous review that noise level between the rooms was intolerable. We could hear the people next door as if they were standing next to us. It got so bad that we requested a room change, the next room was by no means in the same league as the first however we were fed up of moving so did not pursue another change. Both my partner and i requested the turn down service again as we were so impressed with the small luxury. It took 2 phonecalls and 2 mentions to reception staff for 2 nights they missed us out of the service - I decided to speak to the Manager to whom i also mentioned the sub standard room we were moved to (shower was dodgy, carpet had stains on it and there were cigarette ends outside the window). As an apology we were offered a fruit basket? which did not arrive, the next day we received some biscuits and water!!

My overall opinion is the facilities and restaurants are first class and make the hotel stand out - just make sure you get a noise free room.", "Date": "January 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver", "Title": "\u201cincredible luxury\u201d", "Author": "diane13c", "ReviewID": "UR12443225", "Content": "An absolutely beautiful hotel. Got a room with views over the canal to venice. Everything in this hotel was first rate - service, cleanliness, amenities, furnishings. You can only get to/from the hotel via hotel shuttle or water taxi. The shuttle stops at two convenient locations across the canal to begin exploring Venice. Shuttle only ran every 40 mins while we were there, which was good enough for our daily excurions in/out of Venice. Hotel is quite a distance from both the train station and airport, will cost you a LOT if you want to take a water taxi.

The hotel does have a shuttle into a very nice area but you have to take a TAXI or shuttle to the hotel from the train station which is 6 Euro per person. I kept looking for the Hilton shuttle and couldn't find it and it was because there isn't one from the train station-just be aware. Also, Several places in italy do not take credit cards-be aware and always be able to pay with cash for any meal, etc. The hotel is beautiful!!!!!!!!!!!!! the ceilings in the room are amazing and the bathrooms are fantastic, one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed in.", "Date": "January 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lincolnshire, England", "Title": "\u201cIt was fantastic.\u201d", "Author": "Notanotherholiday", "ReviewID": "UR12321154", "Content": "Wow!

So convenient with the free Hilton shuttle boat across to St Marks Square, but also handy for the waterbus stop too.

We had to struggle with guest relations manager to get a venice view room and finally manage to get room 109 but did not realise it was just on top of Rialto bar with piano music going on till midnight disturbing the sleep. Luggage from room 627 to 109 took 45 minutes and reason given was group arrivals. Though a written apology and a complimentary bottle of champagne was sent to our room but it did not make up too much a pleasureable way to start with. especially as it was a surprise for my wife. The concierge sent us in wrong elevator to room 627 at check in and we had to come down to ask for help again while still expecting a nice view which we were gonna have !! Surprising that being 5 star, they did not have UK to Europe power adaptor and just apologised for the same without much help. The breakfast in restaurant wasnt much of high quality and must say service was too poor. Hostess just showed us the place to sit and never explained about breakfast. Had to wander around to ask for help. Chauffing dish of Hash browns at buffet breakfast was always empty and when asking the chefs wandering around, did not understand much english. (surprising for a 5 star hotel). They certainly lacked proper staff to supervise the breakfast in a professioanl manner. Housekeeping Department was great and did really cleaned the room well. I am myself a hotelier and could easily sense that the hotel lacks attention to detail. The food in rialto bar was really nice.

Also, $25 euro per day for internet access is ridiculous. The hotel is beautifully renovated - restoring the old while moderniziing.

The food was good within the hotel and I agree it is a little expensive, but Venice is an expensive turf and everybody who goes there knows it and should be able to cough up about 70-90 USD per adult per meal, or he or she will get mediocre quality. The staff at the executive suite was seriously helpful and the little bites, which they provided were so good that we actually skipped lunch and dinner on a couple of occasions.
