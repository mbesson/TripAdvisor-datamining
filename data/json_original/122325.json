Quiet room with no noise from any neighbors or hallway traffic. Access to the elevator from the lobby is with room key for added security. Nice touch! Plenty of closets - yes that a plural. Misses: Waiting for elevators during normal business hours seemed eternal. At night and during the early part of the day it was quicker. Small thing, but there is only one mirror outside of the bathroom. It is on the bathroom door in a hall with no lighting of its own. Way too dark to use the mirror. Breakfast in the on-site restaurant is too expensive and offers too small a variety of food. We walked two short blocks (3 minutes) over to the Embassy Suites and paid $10 for a full breakfast buffet. Typical Embassy Suites breakfast offerings that include all your beverages. A great value at $10. Valet parking is very convenient, but waiting for your car when they are busy is annoying - especially when your car is brought down in the one exit lane and you wait for everyone in front of you to get everything into their car and move on. Must have waited 15 minutes each time we tried to leave the hotel. However - taking advantage of the hotel's special package that includes free parking does take some of the sting out of the experience.

When searching for a place to stay, I wanted 2 things: 1) a suite with a separate bedroorm and a pull out sofa or room for a rollaway bed, and 2) to be able to walk to the main Philadelphia attractions. After painstakingly researching lodging in Center City, we originally booked at the Embassy Suites, which is basically right next door to the Windsor but cancelled my reservation when I realized they wanted $42 PER NIGHT for parking my vehicle AND because they wanted $11 PER DAY for Internet access. After further research, I finally found the Windsor and a package that included parking. Internet access is also free here. I was saving money - great! Overall, we are very happy with the hotel itself. The hotel is older and the suites reflect that to a point. For example, the bathroom was nicely updated but the door and jambs were old and had several coats of paint on them. Also, the door hinges were rusty - they could have spent a few extra $$ on new hinges and hardware, The kitchen was outdated but it was clean and worked just fine for our purposes - I don't need granite countertops in my hotel room. Let's see......there was a big stain on the carpet in one of our rooms and the pull-out sofa wasn't the most comfy to sit on, but we didn't spend much time sitting around anyway. Another reviewer complained about noise from outside the hotel. This hotel is in the center of one of the largest cities in the United States - you are going to hear horns honking, busses driving by and other typical city noises. We were on the 9th floor and we heard noise, but nothing that kept us awake. however, I do agree that the walls are very thin and I did have to call the front desk about our neighbor's TV being \"too loud\". I honestly don't think they realize it was loud enough to bother anyone else, but the front desk took care of it right away and everything was fine. Noise from the hallway also travelled into the room but it wasn't a problem for us. An indoor pool would have been nice, but that sure wasn't a deal breaker. The view from our HUGE balcony was a great city view as promised. Not the Philly skyline, but enough to let you know you're in a big, historical city. Location coudln't have been better: 5 blocks from Reading Term. Market, 2 blocks from City Hall, 2 blocks from Franklin Institute and Museum of Natural Sciences and maybe 6 blocks from the Art Museum. Ben Franklin Parkway was designed to mimic the Champs Elysees in Paris and, let me tell you, it's quite a beautiful sight! My only real complaint about the hotel was that the customer service was sometimes lacking. Just about everyone was very polite, friendly and professional, but 2 individuals at the front desk weren't as helpful as I felt they could be. I was having problems accessing the hotel's Internet and, on Sunday, the young lady at the front desk told me that the engineer wasn't in yet. I was going to have to call back, rather than her taking my info and asking the engineer to call me. Later on I called and spoke to a young man who told me the engineer didn't come in on Sundays! I told him I was now going on 2 days without Internet and that I would expect some sort of adjustment to my bill if I couldn't access something that was supposed to be a major, free amenity at the hotel. He flat out told me that they would not be able to give me any kind of discount for not being able to access the Internet, despite the fact that was one of the 2 reasons we switched hotels from the Embassy Suites! We left the hotel for awhile and whenI came back in, I asked that same gentleman at the front desk if anything could be done about my Internet problem. Suddenly, the engineer was in! He came up and fixed my problem and all was good. So, in short, the hotel is a bit older but it's clean and rather nice. Staff might need a few pointers in customer service but, overall, everyone was very helpful and seemed to enjoy working there and working with the guests.

The roof-top pool seems rather small and claustrophobic, we did not have time to use it but the guests with kids seemed to enjoy it. There is a small pub and an Asian restaurant on the property with a Starbucks, TGI Fridays and several bars within one block and a WAWA food store around the corner. BTW, if you are coming to party hardy, don't bother. They make you sign a no party or loud noise after 9pm agreement, which is much applauded by all who want peace and quiet.

The Windsor not a new building by any stretch of the imagination, but is well kept and appears to be undergoing a lot of upgrades. Large rooms seem to be the norm here, ours had a full kitchen and plenty of square footage. The bathroom looked recently updated, and although we had some plumbing issues (slow tub drain) maintenance fixed it promptly. The location at 17th & Ben Franklin, just blocks from City Hall is a huge plus, you can walk pretty much anywhere from this spot in no time at all. Service was wonderful, with competent, knowledgable and friendly people at the front desk that made doing business with this hotel a pleasure. Sure, some of the place still needs some facelifting, but the Windsor is a sturdy and comfortable old gal that makes you happy you came to visit her while in Philly. I will book there again if the rates are favorable next time I'm in town.

We had stayed in Embassy Suites in the past and never been disappointed; however, we were able to get a much better price at Windsor, and decided to give them a try. I will try to sum up a few thoughts, I hope it is helpful to someone. 1. Service at this hotel is great! Every employee is friendly and ready and willing to help. The front office manager, Patsy, went out of her way to take care of a problem that we had and checked in to make sure we were content. 2. The hotel is undergoing LOUD construction, contained to the hours of 8:30am-4:30 pm. This construction makes being in the room pretty uncomfortable, although once you are above the 8th floor, it's not too bad. If you're going to be out during the day, no problem. Ask about construction when you reserve. End date is estimated for late May. 3. Their website is useless if you want to know what the different room types mean, and when we called, the information we received didn't match reality. If you just want a big room with a full kitchen, reserve a \"double/double suite\". If you want a full kitchen AND a living room area, go for the \"one bedroom suite\". The living room does not have a full couch, so if you are used to Embassy Suites, know that going in, BUT also, you should know that the living room space is MUCH larger than what you get at Embassy. We needed a space to eat together and hang out, and were very pleased with the space of a one bedroom suite. We also had a double/double suite for part of the group, and that provides nothing for hang-out space. 4. There is a \"continental\" breakfast included. It is actually a fuller breakfast than you expect for continental, including cereal, bagels, fruit and waffles. However, you are only 6 blocks from Reading Terminal Market, so be sure to get there! 5. You can walk wherever you want to go from this location, so get a deal that includes parking, leave your car, and hit your sneakers! There's Trader Joe's market just a few blocks from the hotel. 6. Some rooms have balconies, and some do not. If you care about this feature, be sure to ask for one. 7. I must repeat that the service at this hotel was really good. We were greeted every time we walked in or out of the hotel, and always asked how things were going.

I expected him to do better than that, such as waive the parking costs ($30 per day), but he clearly wanted to do as little as possible to correct the situation and made no effort to make up for the inconvenience, delay in checking in, and the distress of thinking we did not have a room in a city that was extremely short on lodging that particular weekend. In addition, the hotel's valet service drove my husband crazy, due to the poor communication of the guys working there and the lack of clarity at the front desk.

We weren't expecting much more, but were pleasantly surprised at what we got for what we paid. I'm pretty sure we got \"upgraded\", but we weren't about to complain. And it seemed even the smaller rooms weren't too bad either. I have a lot of photos of this hotel that will be uploaded soon as well. Now for the breakdown. BEDS: One king sized bed. Not too hard, not too soft. Easily the most comfortable hotel bed I've had in years. The sheets were clean and the pillows were plentiful. BILLING: No issues, except for a little confusion between the parking attendant and the front desk, but they handled that themselves. BREAKFAST: Free continental breakfast in teh lower lobby, weekends until 10am, weekdays until 9am. Coffee, juice, milk, bagels, cereal, muffins, fruit, yogurt, and the newly popular DIY waffle-makers were provided. Free complimentary newspaper as well. CLEANING: The room was as clean as it could be for a hotel that isn't brand-spanking new. CLIMATE CONTROL: There was a thermostat in the main room and an additional heater/air conditioning unit in the bedroom. We never needed to use the separate unit, but the thermostat kept things very comfortable. ELEVATORS: 3 main elevators service 24 floors, so they were a little slow during busy hours. You need to use your room card to get on in the lobby to go up, but not to get back down. Not a bad idea, it keeps the unwanted guests out. FRONT DESK: The front desk was always very friendly and helpful, but their response time on our requests for toilet paper and extra towels was a bit slow. GYM: A modest gym is provided on the lower lobby level. It consisted of a couple of treadmills, stairclimber, bike, a set of dumbbell freeweights, and one universal weight machine. Lots of TV sets were provided with the cardio equipment to keep you from getting bored. INTERNET: Both wired and wireless, fast and free. No annoying login screens or codes to wade thru, but remember that also limits your security. JACUZZI: N/A. LOCATION: Right in the heart of downtown, blocks from city hall, the art museum, and the newly built comcast center tower. It's on the corner of Benjamin Franklin Parkway and 17th street. If you're looking to spend a lot of your time downtown it's perfect. But the trendy shops of South Street and some of the historic sites will be a hike. NOISE: The hotel itself was pretty quiet as hotels go, although we were not provided with a \"do not disturb\" sign. Of course it's located downtown in a major city, so there's plenty of city noise outside (horns, sirens, cars...) but it's not overwhelming. PARKING: Valet $31/night. POOL: The rooftop pool is open memorial day thru labor day. We were there in the \"off season\" so we did not pay it a visit. RESTAURANT: 2 on site. We patronized the chinese/thai restaurant one night and were pleased with their food and service. It's as good as any, but nothing mind blowing. ROOM: The room itself was enormous. There were two pie-slice shaped rooms actually with a wall between them.

No compensation offered. It is hotel policy not to put night chain or flip lock on the door. The manager said they do not have them but if I wanted one he would install one.

Try the Italian sandwich it was awesome. Great walking distance as everyone has said, we loved Eastern State Penn. and the Mutter Museum.

When we checked out we had an 8pm flight and the hotel had no problem holding our baggage in a locked room, it was quite convenient. Everytime we asked them for directions (which was everyday) they were helpful and not bothered. They even printed out some instructions on the subway line and wrote down directions for us to the Eagles game. The only thing I didn't like was the smell of some of our neighbors cooking.

I had never been to Philly and was there for just a few days. My primary reason for visiting Philly was to see the King Tut exhibit, the Franklin Institute is just a few blocks away. I also wanted to see as much of the city as possible. I earth googled it and mapquested it so I would see right where I was. It was a perfect location. I am a front office manager in a very upscale hotel and was somewhat disappointed in this place. I checked in and the valet parkers were rude from the get go. I had absolutely no assistance with my luggage. My luggage were small pieces and I would have not accpeted help, but not even an offer of assistance. Once I arrived to my room, I found the room (905) to be much larger than I expected and the view of the parklway perfect! I then discovered that the safe did not work;I had every intention of using it. I also discovered that the bathroom sink would not drain and the wireless did not work. I was now frustrated after having been on the road for almost six hours. I called the front desk and was told someone would be up to look at those issues. I went downstairs to ask for restaurant recommendations they sent me to two that were closed! At the same time I asked for restaurant recommendations I informed them that I still wanted the issues rectified; when I returned, nothing had been done and I had been gone at least two hours. I called back down to inform them of this. Now keep in mind that I am in this business so I was polite...I deal with the public, so I was empathetic, yet wanted my issues resolved. Someone came up promptly and was able to fix only the drain. I called back down and asked for another room. I was prompty offered a room (1513) on the a higher floor witha balcony, hard wired internet and a bathroom that was remodeled, all nice but with not a nice view which I wanted. A light in the bathroom did not work, I had to call for new light bulbs. I am sure at this point the front desk staff must have thought I was a a problem guest. Like other reviewers I did not get housekeeping services. I have NEVER heard of a hotel that does not automatically send housekeeping into a room if there is not a privacy sign hanging. I did not at all expect turndown service, but I did expect routine stayover cleaning. I also did not like that I had to come down to the lobby to let anyone coming to visit me on the elevator; the front desk or porter should have a list of in-house guests and arrivals, announce guests and open the elevator. I undertand that it's a safety issue right in downtown, and it can be easily fixed by having a staff member announce guests and let them on elevators. I slept well, it was quiet at night being that the hotel is in the business district. The next morning I ask for a place to get breakfast since they only offer a continental breakfast, I was sent to this HORRIBLE dive around the corner called Pumpernick's...do not go there. I found the staff to be courteous and helpful...yet badly mis-informed about concierge issues. Admittedly, I would stay here the next time I go to Philly simply because of it's perfect location for me. It was right where I wanted to be. If my hotel company had a property in Philly I would stay there yet my company does not. All-in-all, an ok place to stay if you are not looking for luxury accomodations and appointments.

Perhaps some of the rooms are already renovated and thus others' experiences reflect that? All I know is that our room had on only one sleepable bed out of three (two doubles and a sofa bed), it was musty, paint slapped on, mildewy shower curtain, some of the furniture rickety--basically pretty battered in every way. I will say that we stayed anyway and did enjoy the convenience of the location. Like most people, we didn't want to hassle switching hotels/rooms either. Besides the room condition, the service was so-so. When we valet parked, no one seemed ready to help us with our bags coming in or leaving. We saved money by not tipping, but if you needed help with bags, you'd have trouble getting any. We also had a bit of a bug problem (ants) in the kitchen. After we requested the kitchen garbage removed (they didn't take it when they cleaned after the first night), the bugs abated. We also kept all the food in the fridge after that. All in all, the room and hotel are uniformly beat up and most people won't find it acceptable.

The suite turned out to be an old apartment unit, complete with living room and full kitchen, not to mention a walk-in closet. I was only staying for one night, but I did appreciate the gesture. The room itself was old and dark, but fully functional for my purposes. There are two restaurants attached to the hotel, but they looked a little sketchy, so I walked to the TGI Friday's down the street and ate there instead.

My travel companion and I searched long and hard for our accommodation in Philly. This was bar far the best bet - the highest quality, good location, and great amenities, for the cheapest price. Large rooms, old but solid classic wooden hotel furniture. The rooms are huge, have basic but working full kitchen, safe, tv, internet etc and are well heated. Being able to open the windows, or in some rooms, enjoy a balcony, means no cooking smells last long in your room;) No extra frills in terms of pools, etc, but the downstairs restaurants are great. You are also close to other food, wine, supermarket and internet locations: a must in the freezing Philly weather. The front desk were helpful, if curt. The main complaints I have are: 1. They are currently renovating all their plumbing for the showers etc - obviously old and slow draining... so some rooms you end up standing in half a foot of water while showering, but they're on their way to fixing most of this as I write. 2. I was missing a remote control and the phone didn't work when I arrived. I mentioned these, went out for the day, and found the a control on my return and the phone working. the odd and amusing thing was the regular smell of grass in the hallway at around 7pm - someone obviously finished work and sat bakc to relax each night. For reference I ended up paying only $110 AUD per night for five nights. I would recommend booking directly if at all possible, or using internet sites to get the cheaper rate but then calling a day latter to confirm with the hotel to ensure they have a room reserved for you - expedia failed in this regard and I got lucky on the day with their vacancy rates (the hotel front desk indicated this happens regularly, and isn't their fault).

I asked her about the price difference, but she just gave me the silent treatment punctuated with the occassional loud tapping of fake nails on a desk to express her lack of patience. Finally, she replied that the higher number is their price, and that's it. I'm not sure if she just lacked the discretion to match the Expedia price, but her attitude toward service certainly prejudiced me against staying here.
