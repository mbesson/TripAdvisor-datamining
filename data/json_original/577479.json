The price is unbeatable for the location, very central - 2mins from the main train and bus terminal, 10 mins to the colosseum, 15 mins to the Spanish steps. We arrived at about 9am on a night train, the Signora who runs this place (doesn't speak any English) let us in to drop off our bags, let us take a shower and cooked us some breakfast! Very nice! Between my broken Italian and her hand gestures she explained the best way to all the sites, and lent us hidden money pouches to wear. This place does need some work doing to it, and there is a feel that you are just stopping in her front room, but we had great service and good stay there all in all.", "Date": "September 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Argentina", "Title": "\u201cNice signora!\u201d", "Author": "ile_de_la_cite", "ReviewID": "UR116623591", "Content": "I stayed here a long time ago, in October, 2003 (not 2010). It was very cheap, 25 euros plus 2 for breakfast, which was quite good (coffee, juice, 2 big loaves of bread, jam, butter and Nutella). Signora Silvia, the nice old owner, even added a piece of fruit, just for me, when I told her I was traveling on a very tight budget. The room was simple, without bathroom. It\u00b4s on an old building, really close to Stazione Termini. Maybe all neighbourhoods around train sations aren\u00b4t the prettiest, but I felt more confortable walking during daytime. Excellent value, I recomended it to friends, that went, and liked it too.", "Date": "August 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cQuirky and homely - we'd definately reccommend it\u201d", "Author": "Kerry_and_Brian", "ReviewID": "UR79128524", "Content": "We came across this hotel just by chance and would highly recommend it for travellers on a budget.

The place is on the fourth floor and you walk up very dark stairs at night. -Honestly, the list goes on and on. We backpacked for 3 weeks and absolutely loved everywhere we stayed but this place was a nightmare. I am not usually unhappy with service but this was beyond poor.

It is at least 20 minutes walk to the major attractions (forum, coluseum, etc...). The room was very cold an night in February and we had no control over the heat. The shared bathroom is strange because it has no shower curtain and water gets everywhere when you take a shower. The price is good for Rome which is an expensive city and the double room was pretty big for the price. The owner let us use his fridge for our groceries which was nice. The area is perfectly safe which is good since it is near the main train station. Also, we had to pay in cash which was somewhat of an inconvenience since it was a large amount for 4 nights.
