I was hoping for a funky and fun place that is close to shops and cafes. The location turned out to be great, but wow the room we stayed in was very very dumpy. I was truly disappointed and embarrassed that I booked such an awful room for us to stay for the weekend. The floors were dirty, the bathroom was dirty, everything smelled musty. It looked run-down and what I hated most was seeing built-in grime on the edges of the floors and walls. The bathroom door was grimy. Not a cozy place to stay; I think we avoided going back to the room until we had to. Ever since staying there, I've been extra careful about researching a hotel before booking. I would recommend if you are staying at this location (Fairfax/Beverly) go for the Farmer's Daughter.", "Date": "February 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "tucson", "Title": "\u201cHad to put a towel on the bathroom floor\u201d", "Author": "misledandliberated", "ReviewID": "UR24706434", "Content": "No Joke...Bugs fell on my face in the middle of the night.

The neighborhood is nice and quiet. Im a makeup artist and was doing work all week in a studio very close to there and it was convient for me to get to work and back with no traffic etc. Here are the pros and cons The Cons first The Wifi was avaiable only by code and password that they provide you and if you are online and someone else is using the same online code it will say that is busy? The pool never gets sun ( BUT IS VERY CLEAN) The parking is limited ( 20 units in the building with only 8 parking spots ) and the neighborhood is PERMIT parking only . ( however I never had a problem with parking my car but did once when I came back late ( around 2pm the lot was full ) which led me to drive around a million times and I had to park in a lot next door and had to quickly move it by 6am before I got towed. The bathrooms are very very very very very dirty ( the walls have dirty hand prints and the floors are dusty. I cleaned the toliet myself to guarentee a clean seat for me. The room REEEEAKED of smoke They have non smoking and smoking rooms and you can smell the smoke straight through the walls even if your room isnt smoking ( this wasnt pleasent at all ) THE CONS The average hotel for this location is $250 a night I only paid $65 a night!!! They hotel owner was VERY VERY VERY NICE The coffee was always brewed in the morning and he had fresh pastrys that was tasty . The A/C worked great , the beds were cozy ( BRING YOUR OWN PILLOWS the pillows they have are flat as a pancake) The hotel was equipped with several camera and it seemed very safe. There are mircowaves and Refridgerators. The do clean your rooms for you and make your beds etc when you leave for the day and come back everything looks great. The showers are clean but as I mentioned before the floors in the bathroom was dirty and the walls were gross looking . Overall would I stay here again YES Would I reccommend this place to my grandparents NO WAY Would I reccommend to my friends or college friends SURE it is a good conversational piece.

We corresponded several times with management to ensure that our late arrival (12:30am) would be ok, and it wasn't a problem. They were expecting us when we arrived. The hotel is very small, only a few rooms, and it is in a mostly residential area. The room was actually a decent size, with 2 double beds, a mini-fridge and microwave, and an average bathroom. The rooms were decent, clean, and fine for what we needed. The rooms did show their ages, and the Air Conditioner/heater was fairly loud. For someone who needs a cheap place to stay for a night or two, this would be ideal. For someone who wants high quality, this isn't the place. Also, if you are staying for an extended period, please keep in mind that you will need a car. There is ample parking on site, considering the low amount of rooms available. The parking spots are small, however, so don't rent a hummer! Our midsize car barely fit in the spot. Close by is the above-mentioned CBS Television City, as well as the Grove and Farmer's Market's shopping areas. Starline Bus tours stops at the Farmer's Market, and you can buy tickets from the driver, and see Hollywood on the tour. Other than the eateries at the Farmer's Market/Grove, the only other spots close by are a bagel shop and a Subway.

The Russian Driver hardly spoke English and dindn't know the way ...expected me to navigate.. in spite of it being my first visit to the States. and overcharged me for the priviledge. Before going out I needed to operate the automatic drinks machine and Surly Man appeared and was rude and unpleasant, in spite of me remembering my ''pleases and thank yous.'' The next day I had asked' Pleasant Man' to order a cab for 6.00a.m. for flight home the next morning.. In the morning Reception was empty - no cab - and I had to hand in my key. I was told previously that it was 24 hr service..no worries. . Eventually Surley Man arrived - in dressing gown, muttering under his breath - snatched my key and slammed door in my face before I could ask about the cab. I sat outside in the dark , on my own ,for half an hour until a kindly Yellow Cab pulled over and took me to the airport. I'm not suggesting you dont go - but if you encounter this owner remember you have paid for your trip and expect the respect you show him to be returned.I did not find this nasty attitude remotely funny, it was disturbing, bullying is not amusing, under any circumstance.

Understand now that this was a non-smoking room. We all 3 thought that cigarette smoke was apparent, but when we ask the hotel staff, they swore it was a non-smoking room, cause the sign on the door said so! Anyways, once the mess was found by us and reported to hotel staff, we were then blamed for the mess and told to leave the hotel without a refund!

I paid about $70 per night. When we first arrived, we weren't impressed with the lobby area; it looks like it needs a good scrubbing and coat of paint. The young man at the desk was very nice and helpful and we had no problems checking in. We were pleasantly surprised at the room itself as it looked like it had been painted recently and the carpet and bed linens were very clean. There was a small refrigerator which looked pretty old, but worked just fine. The TV also worked fine. There was a smallish pool in the courtyard which looked nice, but we didnt' swim. The only complaint about the room was that the bathroom was a little dingy. There wasn't mold growing or anything, it just looked like it needed a good steam cleaning and coat of paint. Parking was free and was located at the back and side of the building (although if people park over the lines, it's impossible for another card to park next to them). Medium or large cars might not fit. There is street parking in a very nice neighborhood if you can find it. We felt like the neighborhood was safe, especially since we had to walk about 3 blocks to stand in the for The Price Is Right tickets at 4 a.m. It took us about 5-7 minutes to walk there. If you're going to The Price Is Right, the Farmer's Daughter is the closest, but it costs twice as much. For the price, the Bevonshire Lodge met my expectations. I didn't expect \"chain hotel\" amenities (like blow dryers, irons and alarm clocks) and I know that I paid a lot less than I would have at a chain.
