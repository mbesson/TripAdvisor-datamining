We found it from trip advisor, so we expected the small rooms. Reason for staying in this area was a chance to experience \"living in a new york neighborhood\" away from the Times Square hustle and bustle. Charming place and exactly what we hoped for. We felt very safe even if we got home late walking from the subway station. We were 4 friends vacationing. One set of friends were luckily enough to be upgraded to a suite so their room was very big, equivalent to small 2 rooms put together. I had no issues with the small room, as it was clean, the bed was firm and bathroom had hot water. 2 big luggages could fit in the room but left little space for walking around. Staff is friendly, able to recommend great restaurants in the area. Every morning there is free coffee, tea and hot chocolate in the small lobby. Very short walk to Central Park which had a weekend market with local vendors selling fresh vegetables, baked goodies (nice treat).

The old building was heated with steam heat and the transfer pipe for the entire building ran up the wall in our bedroom. It was December and chilly, so the old pipes literally clanked the entire night ( and I mean it sounded like someone was banging on the pipe with a sledge hammer.) The hallways are also very noisy (wood floors echo any walking and talking done in the halls) We called the front desk at 3:30 am to complain about the yelling going on just outside of our doorway ( there was nothing that they could do about the clanking pipes, but they did ask the group of five or six men to leave the hallway) I will say, at checkout the Manager was very nice and apologetic and refunded us one nights stay.

Great little convenience store right across the street. Check-in was fine, hotel staff is very nice, no problems and Hotel was fully booked during our stay.

I mentioned it to the front desk the next morning and she was very apologetic and said if it happened again to notify them immediately. Fortunately there was no further need. The bathrooms have been recently remodeled and are lovely but extremely European in that they are extremely small, narrow and dark.Whoever decided to use wall to wall, floor to ceiling dark brown tiles must be kidding. The lighting is very poor too. I am 5'2\" and frequently banged my head on the towel rack and had trouble closing the shower door. Shower is miniscule - don't drop the soap as there is no way to pick it up without getting out of the shower. Perhaps because they were so full, but our room was never made up until after 3 or 4 pm each day and we had to keep asking for towels --- they would take the dirty ones but forget to give us clean ones.

We have stayed all over the City so this is not our first rodeo but, by far, our worst experience. The biggest flaw with this hotel is the terrible management and absence of leadership when there are legitimate problems present. I encountered guests complaining at the front desk 4 out of the 6 days in which we stayed at this hotel. The desk clerks handle problems without guidance or direction from management -- or perhaps just incompetent and indifferent management decisions. Staff are left to deal with the frustrated (and sometimes angry) guests while the manager hides out in an \"office\" somewhere out of sight. The result is a woeful attempt at service that is lackluster at best and incompetent at worst. It is too bad because this hotel has great potential to be a real gem in the City. THE PROBLEM: Our first evening in NY we returned to our room at 11pm to find the a/c broken and leaking water all over our bed, my luggage and the floor. Throughout the remainder of the night, I was soaking up water with towels (15 towels in all) and alternately shutting off the unit to reset the thermostat. The front desk clerk explained there was nothing he could do until morning---not great news, but understandable given the late hour. The issue is that my husband has a heart condition that is adversely affected by heat and we needed to have a cooler room for him. I spent a good deal of the late evening (or I should say, wee morning hours) calling other hotels trying to locate another room for the evening while also attempting to keep the air conditioner running without leaking water all over the room. The front staff did not offer any suggestions for other hotels, a phone book or even a courtesy phone call (since my cell phone did not work in our room --- all calls were made by me in the front lobby). At approx 2am, the front desk contacted me to say they had a room available due to a late cancellation. It was a single, but I could move my husband to the room while I stayed with the children in our sauna suite. Turns out the room was offered to me for the evening; however, they would charge for my current room, which was already a higher suite rate, and also for the additional room at that posted rate of 170.00. I could hardly believe my ears! To have a room available and not offer it at no charge is unbelievably discourteous -- particularly in view of the health issue involved for my husband. In addition, the next morning, the housemaid told me I would have to pay extra laundry fees for the towels used to soak up the a/c leak. Unbelievable! Three attempts to speak with the manager resulted in these comments: \"you just missed her\" -- \"she just left the building\" --- \"she just went into a meeting.\" The final offer of compensation was to remove the tax for one night's stay...a grand total of less than $20 --- which, by the way, I have yet to receive. It may be that if nothing whatsoever unusual happens during your stay, you will be fine. However, if you have any issue crop up....you will live to regret this stay.

The Park 79 Hotel located in West Manhatten inbetween mid town and up town is an old building, but renovated to a more modern style. The location is only a block away from the Metro and only two blocks from a bar and fantastic coffee house. I like many others hopped on trip advisor and other travel review sites and discovered that the hotel was rated only 3 stars. I read several good reviews and several bad reviews of the place. Being my first time in New York City i was really concerned with finding a safe area and the few bad reviews i had read about park 79 was enough to make me nervous upon arrival. Well within the first 10 minutes of arriving at the hotel all of my worries were sent sailing. The Hotel staff was extremely courtious. ( I never opened the lobby door once! ) the room yet small was perfectly clean with a nice flat screen television and a very modern black tiled bathroom and shower. My friend and I shared a single bed and we did not have any problems at all sleeping. We paid roughly 150$ per night during the week and for Manhatten prices for a hotel with a private bathroom im not sure it can be beat. Ok so obviously im a fan of this hotel and would definetly stay there again. The only reason i will not give it 5 stars is because the elevator in the building is old and it does a take a while to reach the 7th floor and also the walls are thin and you can hear your neighbor pretty easily, but rarely did it bother me. But like i said im not the type of person who freaks out if my pillow is not fluffed correctly... or if the door guy doesnt completely kiss my butt everytime i walk in the door... So i would like to tell all of the travelers out there.. That you honestly can not go wrong with this hotel and it's very close location to the metro line. I talked to a groupd of travelers staying in a hostel in brooklyn for only 20$ cheaper than this place in manhatten with a private bath! And for those who rated this hotel in a negative way may i suggest quit being so nit picky and scaring off potential travelers just because the hotel is not as fancy as there $250,000 garden home. Im glad i took a chance on this hotel and would certaintly stay here again.", "Date": "November 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cCharming hotel - exceeded expectations\u201d", "Author": "machocomacho", "ReviewID": "UR86005819", "Content": "I've stayed at a number of hotels in New York over the years and have never had a bad experience at any of them and this hotel is no exception.

The subway is close and very easy to get to Time Square -first time users and we felt very safe. Nice residential neighbourhood. I suggest taking the Gray Line Hop on Hop off bus tour.

I was traveling with my girlfriend, and the smaller room did not have the queen bed the deluxe did -- which was the whole reason to book it in the first place. To top it off, they charged me full price for the smaller room! Booking a hotel should _NOT_ be like renting a car. We've come to expect horrible service from car rental companies, this place is taking the hotel standard to a new low. What I think happened is that I booked a promotional rate through their website (that's right, not even through a third party site), and this 'other person' was booked at full price.

The hotel has a very attentive staff inside and a doorman; who actually opens the door for you and carries your luggage to the cab (without his hand out for a tip). My room was a twin room with a shared bathroom. The twin room I had was very close to the others, but fairly sound proof from neighbor noise. The shared bathroom was about 5 feet from room 404 and always sparkling clean; never had to wait for anyone. ONE SUGGESTION IF I MAY TO MANAGEMENT: Would be very helpful if you could make disaposable toilet seat covers available (not too expensive in bulk) and also a sink soap dispenser in the shared bathroom as most of us forget soap when using the restroom only. If I may suggest also a hand air dryer would be awesome. With the hottest temps of the year during my stay, I did appreciate the window air conditioner. Not too noisy as some are.

If you're looking for a budget priced hotel in a fantastic position and you're not too worried about being squashed in the en-suite, go for it!

We decided, based on the reviews here, to try this hotel. Although the staff is fine, our \"double\" room had 1 double bed, pushed against a wall. Thus my husband on that side had to crawl down to the foot to exit if I was still in bed, and whacked into the wall when he turned over during the night, disturbing us both. We had asked for a non-smoking room and specifically added that I am allergic to cigarette smoke. Still, we found cigarette burns on the night table and an ashtray in its drawer. The bathroom is so tiny, the shower door opens IN!!! We timed it on 3 occasions, at various times of day, and found it took a full 12 minutes of running the shower to get hot water, and then the water pressure would suddenly cut off for a minute or two mid-shower. When asked, the clerk at the front desk said it takes a long time for the hot water to reach the 7th floor from the basement boiler. Since the sink gets hot water much more quickly, I'm not sure if that's the problem. Noise from the street or other rooms was not a problem, since in the unseasonably hot weather we had to run the A/C, a window unit that was so noisy it was difficult to carry on a conversation or hear the TV, let alone anything outside the room. It is set for one speed, one temperature, and you can't change it, despite controls that would indicate you can. Finally, there is only one tiny elevator in the entire building, --not even a service elevator. This meant waiting for the elevator often took 10-15 minutes.

The addition of free (and very good) wifi is very welcome. The best part of the stay is that it is near some great places to eat. I especially recommend Nice Matin, Cafe Frida and Cafe Lalo. The things that would make this the PERFECT budget hotel would be coffee makers in the rooms (I'm too lazy to go to the lobby for the free coffee in the morning), hooks or wide shelves for clothes in the shared baths and rubber mats in the private bathtubs (the one in my room was frightfully slippery).

I normally stay in midtown at the Pod Hotel but decided to stay here since the rate was a bit better and the hotel was located close to Central Park. Things started out well when I checked in on Friday and was given a room on the top floor, the doorman even helped me with my two large bags (I had been traveling for work prior to this segment so I had bags leftover from that). However, then things were not so good. The elevator is one of those 'beam me up Scotty' elevators which really only fit about 4 people comfortably--and that's with no bags. I had to have the bellman take my bags up separately because I just wasn't sure how I was going to fit in the elevator with them! The room was small but mostly functional. I say mostly because I did have some left over work to do on my laptop and only realized later that there was no chair or desk in the room. Which left me sitting on my twin bed, with the laptop in my lap. At one point, the computer fell on the floor, damaging my jumpdrive I had plugged into the side of it. I suppose it was my fault because I was trying to get off the bed although the mattress was so firm/shot that if you moved at one end of it, you almost saw the earthquake-like ripples down to the other end before your stuff went flying off the bed. Speaking of the mattress, it wasn't the worst one I had slept on this trip, but it wasn't nearly as nice as I had expected from other reviews and desperately needs to be replaced. It was nice to have a sink in the room however the taps had been broken at some point so you had to work them to get the water to turn off--if you turned too far, the water would come back on again. The radiator stayed on all night--which is good for someone who is cold-natured, but since i'm not, I had the window open the whole time. There is no screen on the window nor any air conditioning in the room so I wouldn't recommend this hotel during the hot NYC summers. I didn't have any issues with birds since it was super cold during my visit. My room did not have a bathroom so I shared the one down the hall. I never had any issues getting into the bathroom despite the hotel being completely booked. The bathroom was clean although it did take up to 20 mins some times for the hot water to start! On my last morning, I went to the bathroom and wasn't able to get back into my room because my key stopped working. I had to go back down to the main desk and get the keys rekeyed. This was at 8:45am and check out isn't until much later. Overall, I would say this is a OK place to stay if you need a place to crash in the city and don't want to spend too much (I paid $175 a night, taxes included but wouldn't spend more than that here). The subway is moderately close as is the Hudson and Central Park.

Value: Excellent. I chose a room that cost a little bit more because I did not want to share a bathroom. I still only paid $109 for a room in NYC!!! (Two single beds). At the time I booked the shared bathroom rooms were about $79. These are excellent prices for NYC. Cleanliness: This hotel is VERY clean. Hallways, room and especially bathroom - super clean. It is an older building, and because real estate is premium price in NYC the rooms in the older buildings are usually smaller than the newer hotels. But that's part of the charm of NYC. If you expect it, it won't be a problem. We had plenty of room between the beds and the walls. In my room there was even a little area where the closet was. The beds were a little firm, but I had no problem sleeping. My daughter also said she slept well. The rooms are equipped with iron and ironing board, phone, clock, TV (flat screen mounted on the wall), hair dryer., closet. The room air conditioner worked well (although it is - like all of the room air conditioners that fit in the windows - a little noisy - but it didn't bother my sleep). I asked for a quiet room when I booked the hotel, and they gave me one. It was on the 5th floor and it had no view (doesn't bother me any - I'm not sight seeing from my room) and there was NO street noise. Yay! I did not have any problem with people noise either. There was a door that I believe led to the room next door. There was a permanent lock on it and one time I did hear people talking. I could not understand them, but heard them. So I believe, the complaints of the walls being thin is really the noise through the doors. You can see that the walls are thick plaster. Room was decorated nicely, adequate lighting. Food: There are absoutely so many food choices in NYC. We walked up and down Amsterdam Ave in the evening looking for a light snack. There were all options and types of restaurants, bars, delis, etc. My daughter got a slice of pizza - and she was pleased. You can spend any amount of money, there were expensive and resonable places. One of the pubs had a \"happy hour\" - $2.00 cans of Bud Light. WOW! Couldn't believe the price - especially for NYC. We felt safe in the neighborhood. Convenient too. If you walk a couple blocks to Broadway and 79th, there is a subway. I was able to find a parking spot on the street. I was SOOOO LUCKY to find one. Before 11:30 am, you MUST move your vehicle to the other side of the street or it wil be towed. I did not have to worry becasue we left before then. When I booked the hotel room, I called and they told me there is parking garage available that they give discounts for. The staff was very helpful.

Whereas, across the road still on Amsterdam avenue but a further 2 minute walk is \u2018The Gin Mill\u2019 bar where they do a draught beer for $1 on Monday nights with no cover charge. On the same side is a small poky looking place called \u2018Brother Jimmy\u2019s\u2019.

This location in the Upper West Side is something that made the hotel attractive to me. The hotel staff seemed competent and helpful. I found the price quite reasonable compared to other hotels in the area, but the reasonable price involved getting a room that had no private bathroom. I didn't find this too inconvenient for my one-night stay alone since the room did have a sink, and the shared bathroom (which is keyed to just a small number of rooms near it) was very clean and large enough. As other reviewers have noted, the rooms are very small (but clean), and mine was no exception. It had a bed, a nightstand, and a TV on another piece of furniture, and although I would have liked a chair so that I had something other than the bed to sit on, I am not sure that a chair would have been able to fit!! I imagine that two people in the room would have been a bit crowded, but if you use the room as a place to sleep and plan to spend time out exploring NYC, then it is probably workable. The only problem I had was with the free wireless internet. In my room, I could pick up about 10 different wireless networks except for the hotel's own! I had to stand by the elevators outside of my room to pick up the hotel's signal, which was a bit annoying. In sum, if you don't mind slightly cramped quarters and no real amenities, but really want a reasonably priced, clean, and well-positioned hotel in the Upper West Side, then I would recommend it.

But it didn't strike me that W. 79th Street is unduly noisy at night. I did notice a couple of times that if someone was holding a conversation in the corridor that could be disturbing, especially late at night, but that's true of any hotel of this category. It's a matter of luck how inconsiderate one's fellow guests are and that doesn't have much to do with the hotel. One of our party had problems with a blocked toilet. This has happened to me several times in different hotels in NY and I can only imagine that the piping in older NY buildings is inadequate for modern day needs. Anyway the blockage was promptly dealt with the next morning and in the mean time my friend was given access to one of the shared toilets, which was quite acceptable. We were satisfied with the attitude of the reception personnel and the service in general. The lift is antediluvian and slow, but it works reliably and a little patience is advisable. The location is ideal \u2013 one block from Central Park just behind the Museum of Natural History. There are plenty of excellent restaurants nearby, especially on Amsterdam Avenue.

Adequate heating, with windows to open when it got a bit warm. Views of the alley or street traffic, depending on room location... Desk staff and concierge were very polite and helpful when necessary. Bed matress was generally uncomfortable... asked neighboring guests - theirs too. Elevator was painfully slow. Two adults, two average pieces of luggage, and maybe one other person can squeeze in at a time. Often waited 15 to 20 minutes to go up or down... Complimentary lobby coffee not so good, often cold; at least a 5-10 block walk in any direction for good food at reasonable prices.

I am an often visitor of NY and I chose Park 79 because the pictures on Hotels.com made the place look so charming and also its not far from great restaurants and shopping. My first day I got into my room I was greatly disappointed. Boy did the pictures on Hotels.com lie! A bed and a small bathroom. THAT'S IT. Don't look for anything else. The heating didn't work in my room (I traveled in January one of the coldest months in NY) and I was told by the hotel front desk clerk that it would have to hit below 25 degrees in order for the heat to kick in. I was livid to say the least and by night time when I felt hyperthermia setting in the night desk clerk (CJ) who was a God send, took me to see several rooms where the heat actually did work and let me chose with room I wanted. After getting the second room, I tried to play plumber to a toilet that ran 2 nights straight even after they had maintenance come to repair it. After they couldn't get the toilet fixed I was then moved AGAIN for the third time to a room that was heated and had no running toilet but was even smaller than the other two previous ones. I decided to just cut my losses and just be happy with the heat and the non running toilet. The upside is that the staff is very helpful. Some more than others. Once again, the location is great, centrally located across the street from the Museum of Natural History and not far from Central Park. If you have the extra money to stay someplace better..DO SO! If you're short on cash or just need a place to crash for a couple of nights ...this place will fit your needs. My last warning is that the walls are PAPER THIN. You can and will hear everything.

Park 79 on 79th Street, New York, is the place to go, want to know why\u2026 read on\u2026 My girlfriend and I were looking for somewhere to spend Xmas, what better place really than New York, it has everything, trust me, after I have reviewed the above mentioned hotel, I\u2019ll tell you why and where you should go in the Big Apple. But first the hotel\u2026 Getting from JFK, as we did, to the hotel cost us around $50 in a taxi and it took around 1hr 20mins. You can do the same journey using the subway for only $7, which we did on the way back. Ok, location\u2026..Perfect is the only word; you can walk to everything, within reason! Central Park - 10mins away Natural History Museum - 5mins away Subway - 10mins away Great Bars - 5mins away Great Diners/restaurants - 5mins away I could go on, but there really is no need, take it from me, the location is perfect! You are far enough away from the \u201cmajor\u201d sights so as not to be hassled by crowds, if you want to fall out of your hotel and land in tourist heaven, then this is not the place for you. If you want to walk to them with your morning coffee through Central Park, then this is your place! The rooms are not the biggest you will see, if you are a more \u201cbigger boned\u201d person then the shower could be a bit of a squeeze, if you go for a room as we did, with own bathroom. Should you opt for the shared bathroom, then the shower is large enough for even the larger person to jump and dance around. Bed was very comfortable and there was more than enough storage room to accommodate our winter clothes. The rooms were very warm, if not too warm at night; excellent maid service ensured we had clean towels and a crisply made bed every day! Flat screen TV had a whole range of channels should you wish to kick back, relax and watch 10 minutes of a TV show before it being interrupted by adverts!! The doormen and reception staff were very obliging to any questions or help we asked of them, free coffee was on offer every morning too! If there was anything bad to say about this hotel, then I would have to say the lift, we were on the 4th floor so didn\u2019t mind walking, but if you are on the top floor the walk could become a bit tiresome. The lift (singular, there was only one!) was slow, VERY slow, but the speed of the lift should not distract from the fact that this hotel is excellent. So a few more tips for the New York traveler. Number 1 tip, buy a subway card, we got one for 7 days for $24, every ride, no matter how far you are going cost $2, so buying a card means you can go subway crazy!! Empire state building - don\u2019t be pulled in by the guys trying to convince you to go to the next level up, it\u2019s so not worth it! Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island - both can be done by getting a ferry, the latter is the better venue, very interesting, don\u2019t miss out by thinking, Blah Blah Blah\u2026 Ellis Island is well worth a visit. Central Park \u2013 best park in the world, it\u2019s clean, it\u2019s BIG, and it\u2019s GREAT! Natural History Museum \u2013 check out the planetarium, the IMAX show they have on is very spectacular. I could waffle on, but you\u2019ll all go out and buy your Lonely Planet Guide anyway, this review was about Park 79 on 79th Street. A great little hotel that shouldn\u2019t be missed.

I didn;t spend much time in my room so it's size didn't particularly bother me. However the heating was unbearably hot - and when I opened the window the entire panel collapsed on me so i had to get maintance to fix it and they weren't able to turn it off. Also the pipes for heating make a lot of noise every few minutes so if you';re a light sleeper this might bother you. The first morning I had no hot water in my shower - for a hostel i would expect this - not for a 350 dollar a night stay! They rectified it when I rang reception but for that price it shouldn't be an issue. I would stay here again if I couldn't find anywhere else. On the plus side it was clean and felt safe and convenient. NEgatives it's not a boutique hotel - 350 dollars is a lot for paper thin walls, lack of hot water and a tiny room - but it appears impossible to get a good value hotel in New york.

On the plus side, this hotel is in a very nice neighborhood on the Upper West Side. It is near several very pleasant restaurants, good boutique-type shopping (Eileen Fisher, Design Within Reach), and a block from Central Park. I come here from DC for work, and usually stay in midtown, so it is a very nice change to be in a neighborhood. There is free wireless, and the hotel staff was very cheerful and helpful. On the negative side, I found this hotel quite shabby and drab. It is a 7 story converted apartment bldg/townhouse. I had a queen suite -- room 714. No view, tiny tiny bathroom. There are a few upscale-ish touches (new floors, lavatory that looks like it is from Restoration Hardware), but on the whole, I found the place pretty basic. To be clear, there is nothing terrible about the place -- it is clean and in a safe neighborhood, but the website description of a \"boutique hotel\" is misleading. I paid $379 per night for the suite (not including taxes, which put the place at $444). I had to book at the last minute for work, and stayed here b/c of a complicated deal involving my husband being up here for work and having to stay here.

The location is amazing, close to Central Park and the Museum of Natural History, subway stations, tons of shops and cool restaurants (wide range). Also, a quieter residential neighbourhood (read: non-touristy). There's a great convenience store/deli across the street open late. The rooms are very comfortable, the decor fashionable.

I'm more sensitive about noise and found it a bit noisy at nights from the hardwood floors in the hallways and people walking and closing doors as the soundproofing around the doors is quite lacking. The first room close to the elevators was very noisy, but the second room further back was much better. The staff were very helpful and friendly. We very much enjoyed our stay.

The street was calm and safe. The room was small as expected, clean and the bed was firm (unlike the Amsterdam Inn where we stayed previously). The clerks were polite and allowed us to check-in early to a different room that was ready. We asked for a room that did not face the street and that was on a non-smoking floor and that is what we were given. The room had a micro-bathroom (tiny, my shoulders touched the wall when on the throne) with a shower stall beside the sink. The bed filled most of the room. The TV was just a few feet from the foot of the bed, and there was a few feet of floor space along the side of the bed between it and the bathroom. Otherwise the bed occupied most of two walls. Storage for clothes was minimal. There was an average sized dresser with three drawers, and a rack with ten or so hangers attached and a shelf on top (instead of a closet). Basically the suitcase fit under the rack right beside the TV and clothes became part of the decor. There was an iron and board (we didn't use them through). The shower had hot water and good pressure, the bathroom had a blow-dryer (that worked well), the towels and linens were clean, no stains, and no sign of bedbugs or any other nasties. But there were no chairs or desk - there was no room for them! Whatever you do, sit, eat, sleep, you do on the bed or the stool at the foot of the bed. The room also had a small safe in the sidetable that worked with a four number code of one's choosing. The air-conditioner was predictably noisy, as was the fan in the washroom, and we did hear the door to the common bathroom down the hall, but the noise was minor, nothing that earplugs didn't remedy. There was a phone in the room, but because we booked with Expedia we needed to give a credit card number, and the rate was 75 cents for the first minute and 25 cents for every additional minute. On the day we checked-out they allowed us to leave our luggage there while we ran last-minute errands. There were no weird misunderstandings, no gaffs or gaps in service other than one day the maid forgot to leave clean towels - but a call downstairs had fresh ones to us in minutes. We thought that Park 79 was what we expected, a place for us to leave our belongings safely, and a base for us to return to at the end of the day to bathe and rest. It was not a place to entertain or do work. PLUSES: The cleanliness, security, firm bed, and location. MINUSES: The lack of seating, the tiny washroom, the noisy bathroom fan. Basically the room was a fine base for a short stay but would not suffice as a place to spend much time in as one might on a longer stay.

We agreed to that offer as it would have been too difficult to find another hotel at that stage. We did receive an apology from the receptionist & a small box of chocolates (2 pieces) . Air conditioning unit was hopeless, hardly made a difference in the room, big old fashioned type that sounds like a 747 landing at all speed settings.

We stayed a week, and the place was clean and kept clean, and overall a great value for the price. But I only had one complaint. We were booked for 7 days, and on the 6th day my girlfriend and I decided to try to book an extra night. We were on our way out for the day and stopped by the reservation desk to do so. The credit card was charged, a receipt was given and we were told that we were \"all set to check out on wednesday\" (instead of tuesday, as it was originally). We walked out and spent our day shopping and seeing the sights, as expected. Apparently, an hour after we left for the day the woman at the desk left a message on our hotel phone (though we were out, and she knew this) saying that our \"reservation\" could not be honored, and that we needed to find another place to stay. Because she didn't bother calling the number she had on file, we didn't get this message until 1am. So with plane reservations already made and plans to stay an extra day (for example, tickets to the empire state building and dinner reservations), we were told we needed to find our own place because they \"overbooked\" the rooms. Instead of the hotel manager helping to resolve the issue we were offered a telephone book and location of an internet cafe to locate our own hotel. We were exhausted from the day and to hear that we need to pack and move to a new hotel in just a few hours was ridiculous. The next morning I woke up early and spoke to the front desk, who said they'd speak to the supervisor. After calling back an hour later, I was told that the manager came by but left without addressing our situation. I told the woman at the front desk that my credit card was charged and that the hotel was at fault, and she told me that they voided the charge (without my knowledge) the day before. At this point they were telling us to leave, so I responded with proper frustration and told them that this was their problem and I wasn't going anywhere until they fixed it. I demanded to speak to their manager and they told me they would call her, again. So I told her that I know how this works. Hotels overbook all the time, and when they do they always offer to fix the problem one way or another. After all this it was Nelson at the reservation desk who contacted the manager, who finally managed to find a way to keep us there after all. I should have talked to him first. I never did talk to this supervisor. I really wanted to give this hotel a good review. We even took nice pictures of the room to post after our trip, but this problem caused me way too much grief on my last day. I would never stay here again.

I am a single traveler and rarely travel with the expectation that I will be spending much time in a hotel room, so my needs are minimal - and they were met, plus. Yes I had a small room roughly 72 sq/ft with a twin bed, a dresser with a small TV on top of it (limited selection), a nightstand with light and telephone, and a padded bench to sit on or put things on top of. As I rented a room that shared two bathrooms on the same floor, there was also a sink stand with a mirror over it and a place to put your personal items - fresh towels & linens were provided daily. There was also a place to hang your clothes (over the stool), and a niche where you could place luggage. A small do-it-yourself safe was also located under the nightstand. Yea!! they had free wireless throughout the hotel, so I was able to log in and get my e-mail and check out directions, restaurants, sites, etc., in the evenings. Yes, the walls are paper thin, but once you realize that, hopefully you try to be quieter than normal and not disruptive of your neighbor. I am an early riser, and regretted having to move about knowing that it was disruptive to neighbors, but I did so quickly so as to get out as soon as possible. Yes, I did have trouble with hot/cold water at first, but I found that if I let the water run for a couple of minutes, the hot water came in - and then it was scorching hot. I didn't have any problems with this at all on the 6th floor from May 3-10. The bathrooms were always empty and always very clean whenever I accessed them. Same to be said of the room - mine was always neat and clean whenever I returned from my excursions late in the afternoon. The staff people were very friendly and very helpful. On several occasions, I asked for help with directions and recommendations, and they went out of their way to help. When I first arrived, the room was a little warm, and the window would not stay open unpropped.

However, there are some areas which the hotel could improve upon. First, the doors slam. This would not normally be a huge problem in a hotel, except that it is exacerbated by the fact that the walls are paper thin. It is quite annoying. Secondly, the hot water was lukewarm for about 2 days of our stay. In fact, I could not get ANY warm water on Saturday morning at around 11 am. I politely but firmly explained this fact to reception, and also a security guard/ maintenance worker who was at the front desk. Incredibly, they questioned whether I had mastered the technique of turning on the shower. I had used the showers the previous day, so I knew I was turning it on the right way. I told them that, not only did the two showers on my floor not have hot water, neither did the floor above. I specifically asked whether this was a problem they had encountered before. I got a sweet smile, and an incredulous \"no!\" but I suspect that the hotel is overloaded and not properly equipped for all of the guests staying in the miniscule rooms.

Again, if this was a normal sized hotel with thicker walls this wouldn't be much of a problem, but you could hear EVERYTHING. That's the negative part.

It had a pedestal sink with shelf, mirror, and blow dryer; a full-sized tub with shower and sliding glass doors that had handles from which to hang towels; and a toilet with towel shelves above. Our room faced the side of the building next door, so street noise wasn't an issue. I did find the hallways to be very loud due to the hardwood floors. They're original and beautiful, but noisy when people are walking by and create an echo. The front desk staff were helpful and friendly as were the doormen.

The website is deceiving though - the rooms do not look like the one example they give. (OK, maybe one room might look like that!)

This was our first time staying here. The entry and foyer were presentable and the doorman was very accommodating. Can't say the same for the reservation clerk though. We liked the looks of the outside but our first impressions were dashed once we got to our room. Small is being kind! I kid you not, the room was no larger than 10x10 feet and within that cubical they had managed to squeeze in a tiny bathroom just large enough to back into the toilet then go forward 2 steps into a cubical shower, squeezing past the tiny sink in the process. No place to hang towels, NO closet. Our double bed was shoved over in the corner against the wall with about 3 feet of space to move about at the bottom of the bed past the only open side to the bed. . Traveling on the cheap in New York City does have its up-side, however - the $140+ dollars we saved at the 79 was spent going to the opera! Bottom line: an OK cheap place to stay for the buck.

Maybe it was due to the bad reviews that had been written that i was happily suprised at how nice the hotel was. The rooms are small but very comfy beds, perfectly good working bathroom and t.v with quite a few channels. The location is perfect and i highly reccomend a tea shop called Alice's Tea Cup - Its great. Its 2 blocks (i think) down from the hotel and does the best sandwiches,tea,scones,cakes,cookies - everything. The room we had was with a private bathroom but having had a slight situation with a blocked toilet we did have to use the one next door which is used for 'shared bathroom' guests. It was perfectly clean and tidy - they provide air freshener and it was obvioulsy well kept. This sould have been down to the cleanliness of the guests using it of course but i thought it really was fine. The toilet was unblocked within 24 hours (on new years day too so this was quite good) and the problem never occured again. We didnt experience any bad smells or unmaid beds, the carpet was clean and we were given fresh towels everyday. I do agree that some of the reception staff have a little customer service issues but given the short amount of time you are in the hotel i feel it would be a waste of money to pay for a better hotel. However the doormen were very helpful (getting us a taxi when we were going home, helping with bags etc) and the maids were exceptional. Stupidly we left our save open one days full with camera's, money, passports, tickets and credit cards and upon returning the whole lot were still there. I really do feel some of the reviews about this hotel are unfair but it does depend on what you expect from a hotel i suppose. If you want a Ritz or Plaza type hotel then this really wouldnt be the place to come but if you want a holiday inn type hotel then this is the place. Girls, if your anything like me I am always a bit worried of where im going to stay where as my boyfriend is a lot more relaxed - and i did have some reservations about this hotel but i can assure you there really is nothing to worry about. It is slighly loud at night with noisy people talking loudly in the corridoors but then people should also be a little more considerate. Oh and a tip - the room did get quite warm and radiators cannot be turned down. Leave the bathroom (if you have one) light on - it makes the fan work which is a bit like air con!!!

We chose this hotel because the room was a set price and it was a great deal for 4 people. Most other hotels I searched had no deal if two couples were sharing a room. The hotel was well located and the rooms were fine. We stayed in 2 suites while we were there. 518 had a tiny bathroom with a VERY dark shower. 418 had a full bathroom and was well laid out. If you are looking for a suite I would specifically ask for 418. The rooms were clean and the hotel was very quiet. I never heard other guests and the hotel was fully booked. The neighbourhood was great. We loved our daily walk by the museum of Natural History to the subway stop. Central park is also very close and there are tons of restaurants around. (I suggest Big Nicks on Amsterdam if you want a real crazy NY experience). The only thing I didn't like about the hotel was the front desk service. We had to pay for the room upon check in (which I thought was bizarre) and once we checked out on the 11th the man working that morning was debating with me that I had not paid for the room. He kept me at the desk as he shuffled through papers trying to prove that I had not paid. I finally showed him my visa receipt and offered to phone Visa so he could hear from them that I had paid but he finally let me go! This was ridiculous and really wasted my time. I feel there were better ways to deal with this problem and that he was really not listening to his customer. I am a big believer in good customer service and this small experience really left a bad taste in my mouth. Overall I would recomend this hotel for its location and good price.

Also, talk to the locals at the delis, they gave us great recommendations for restaurants. H&H bagels is one more block up on Broadway.

We stayed three nights, and over our stay we paid $245 per night on average. My first impression is that they \"rennovated\" it to raise room rates, but didn't quite fix everything. We saw both rooms (one on 5th floor, and the other on 6th) so my comments reflect the condition of both. Mind you, there were no pests visable, but if that is your benchmark for a quality establishment then you should really consider raising your expectations. In short, the hotel was \"rennovated\" simply because there were too many complaints of duct-tape repairs and critters roaming the floors; but they stopped short of making the rooms as good as the rate commands. They have cleaned up the property...there's no doubt of that, it's just that they only cleaned and could have (and still can) really improve the existing space. The good: -great location in quiet neighborhood (close to park and subway) -fresh paint, linen, and some other newer elements to the rooms -newly done washrooms* (see below) -new T.V. but it should be on wall-mounted bracket -coffee in lobby in the A.M. but no pastry -free wireless internet in rooms The rest: -Walls & Ceilings so thin you can hear phone rings, conversations, TV and see the light in some cases without making any effort at all. -Elevator is guest & service in one, so you may have to wait 10 minutes plus while linen and luggage is transported through the day -\"closet\" is a small bar behind the door with no closet door -Carpet in rooms is thinner than astroturf on a mini-putt putt course and might as well have been just a paper towel. Floors in halls are chipped and chunks are missing in places -No desk or work space at all...not even for a laptop -couples have to decide who sleeps against the wall as the room size is barely wider than the \"full\" bed plus 3 or 4 feet on one side, and shoved into a corner on the other -LADIES BEWARE all mirrors are at shoulder/chest height so you have to stand on the bed to check your outfit -Bathroom is new, but no soapdish at sink or shower, no light in shower stall, no tub, no clearance to fully open shower door, and no towel rack makes you wonder why they bothered to begin with. The dark tile with no light makes it look like a cave, and impossible for wives to apply make-up without guessing. Could be solved with a sconce or two. -No plugs in room. Charge your laptop and phone(s)?....unplug a lamp to do it. -Window AC unit are signaling \"filter replace\" and are noisier than a lawnmover though the night. -no amenities (soda/vending/ice/etc.) although there are a hairdryer and safe in rooms IN CLOSING: All in all, the hotel provides little more than a bed and TV with a dark bathroom, a paper thin room, and no room to do any business including meeting anyone in the \"lobby\" (only 2 chairs).

It was spring so we just opened the window. The wasn't much street noise. The bathroom was pretty funny. The sink overlapped the toilet, the shower door hit the sink with about 18\" of clearance and if the bathroom door was shut, you had about 12\" to get in. My husband had to open the bathroom door, get in the shower, then close it. The shower did take a while to heat up, but nothing too ridiculous. One tip for anybody who might wish to apply make-up: the lighting in the bathroom over the room's only mirror was not adequate, so bring a hand mirror to do it by the window or table lamp.

On the latest trip down(first week in Dec. '05) we decided that this time we'd try to visit Manhattan \"on a budget\" and booked the Hayden Hotel with mixed results. Our room was $209 with it's own bath. (be aware that some of the rooms are less but have a shared bath) The hotel itself is clean but, well, rather tired and worn. Bumps, dings and scratches,cover the walls and floors. Our room was small, even by New York standards,and during our 4 day stay we began to jokingly refer to it as \"the closet.\" As one reviewer wrote it is almost as big as a college dorm room.....almost. The bathroom was almost comical in its \"petiteness.\" (I could not wash my face in the tiny sink without dripping water all over the floor as the clearance from the bowl to the wall was so shallow.) Luckily both my wife and I are very thin so we were able to move around without too much fuss. ;-) The staff seemed friendly, but my wife and I know NYC well enough to not need much, if any, help from concierges, so we didn't interact too often with any of them. Now to be fair, we usually stay in hotels like the Kitano or City Club which are light years ahead of the Hayden in detail, comfort,service and amenities. Of course,however, the Kitano and City Club are also *significantly* higher in price. That said, this still leaves the Hayden in a very strange niche. The old saying \"You get what you pay for\" doesn't seem to apply here. It's too expensive for what it offers to be considered a \"true\" bargain and it seemingly offers no more than the chain hotels like those owned by Applecore Hotel for $40-50 less per night. ---So I can't quite figure out who Hayden's target audience is. Bargain hunters can do much better elsewhere, as can those seeking a hotel that is \"quaint,\" \"charming\" or even \"quirky.\" Bottom line: The Hayden is clean, and seemingly friendly; but tiny, bland, and a bit scruffy.

I specifically requested a room without a mouse problem, as that is what most concerned me. I was SO pleasantly surprised. My room on the 6th floor was quite spacious for a NY budget hotel-- probably about 12x18 ft with a large closet, writing desk, dresser and two windows facing north overlooking the rooftops. The bathroom was small, but adequate and newly renovated. The furniture, though new, was of a dated style, and the carpet, though clean, was drab in color and industrial in quality. I arrived at night and the dim light from the ceiling fixture gave the room a kind of dreary appearance, but there were bedside lamps and a nightstand on each side of the bed which was quite nice. The walls were painted stark white and were unadorned except for a large ornamental mirror and a framed print or two. I don't make it sound very pleasant, but it really was quite soothing, albeit unadorned. It was a very hot day, but the window airconditioner was quiet and efficient. The staff was laid-back and good humored. There were no mice in evidence. I asked the desk clerk if mice were a problem, and she said that while the renovations were progressing it had been, but it was no longer an issue. I ordered food delivered to my room, and did not have a visit from mice, but hung the bag with food leftovers in the shower stall. Perhaps this was not necessary, but I thought it would be an easy precaution to take, as the guests reporting mouse problems seem to have put food in bags on the floor. The hallway floors are a nice wooden parquet (not the new inexpensive parquet tile kind). Whoever did the renovation understandably wanted to show them off, but this of course makes the halls noisier than they would be if they were carpeted. I thought the halls were charming and very much NY-residential from the 20s or so. The people who complain about the elevator should get over it, and should go stay at a high rise Holiday Inn. The elevator is really fine. It is the kind that you are happy to find in a European hotel. I would definitely stay here again. I think it is one of the best deals in NYC.

In regards to the facilities, space is very limited. There's not much that can be done there, short of a full renovation floor by floor. Including a reduction in rooms by floor for roomier accommodations. Don't see this happening any time soon. The Hotel main entrance and lobby are nice and look clean. The staff was friendly and attended all inquiries fast. The elevator needs to be replaced A.S.A.P. It's too slow, small and weathered. It kills the first good impression you might have when you check-in. The day before we checked out the elevator was breaking down, but repairs were scheduled quickly. I originally booked a room with private bathroom, but after reading reviews here and elsewhere, I decided to get the suite. Like many have mentioned before the rooms are small. The suite we got had a bedroom about 10'x10' with a queen bed, drawer chest that doubled as a TV stand and a night stand. On one side there was about 2 feet of walking space and about 8 inches on the other side and the base of the bed. The living room (aprox. 12'x10') had a small sofa-bed, a drawer chest with a large TV, a cocktail table, and a chair. The suites are good for not more than 2 people. I didn't get to see the smaller rooms, but considering the size of the suite I would imagine them to be very small. I didn\u2019t mind the two huge 27\u201d or 32\u201d TV\u2019s in our suite, but maybe smaller 25\u201d o 19\u201d would have sufficed considering the limited space. Our room had a very small bathroom (3'x6' aprox.) with a shower booth and a toilet. The lavatory was in a small area near the main door. Hot water is a problem though. We were on the 5th floor and it took some time for the hot water come out, at least 10 minutes or more, it really adds up in wasted water. The first few days NYC temperatures were in the low 50\u2019s and the Hotel heating systems worked well. The rest of the time the temperatures were in the 60\u2019s and low 70\u2019s. Also right next to the main door we had a small but useful closet. Noise was not a problem. The halls floor makes a lot of noise when people walk on them but apparently it did not permeate into the room much. In this aspect we basically had a good night sleep during our stay. This is basically the overall description of what we experienced at The Hayden Hotel. Now, the Good, the Bad and the Ugly. The Good The Hotel rates are good. The staff of the hotel is friendly and helpful. They will store your luggage free of charge when you check out so you can do more sites seeing before your flight. The room maintenance personnel are very nice too. The location of the hotel is great. If there's only one good reason to stay here it's the location. You get the Museum of Natural History, Hayden Planetarium, NY Historical Society and Belvedere Park right across the street. Central Park is just a block away. You\u2019re at walking distance to the Children\u2019s Museum, The Dakota Building, fine restaurants and galleries and even the Lincoln Center and Julliard\u2019s School of Arts if you like to walk little more. There\u2019s also access to both the 1, 2, 3 & 9 subway train one block away and the A, B, C, D trains at two blocks distance. Tip: Get the metrocard and hop-on and off the subway and buses as much as you need to. It\u2019s a great neighborhood. One thing, the Deli across the street from the hotel is ok, but the clerks are not too friendly. Try the Deli on the corner of 80th. The coffee is very good, the breakfasts are good and clerks are friendlier. The Bad Size matters. The rooms are small. The elevator is too small, not adequate for the amount of people entering and leaving the Hotel most of the time. If they cannot change it because of structure limitations, then they should renovate it with a modern faster unit. The hot water problem needs to be addressed if just solely to conserve water and $$ on the water bill, since it takes more than 10 minutes for the hot water to come out. Another issue is the renovation results. Our suite was recently renovated, but the bathroom shower booth had an acrylic door that was at least 3\u201d too small. When you close the shower door there was a 2 to 3 inch open gap were the water would splash out and partially flood the bathroom floor. I think the Hayden either hired a cheap contractor or they did it in house with poor quality control. The room\u2019s door made about 6 inch scratches on the wall when opened or closed. The door knob on the closet door came off on first use. The Ugly Yes! I saw a small mouse. The only noise that woke me up on one occasion was the crackling sound o plastic bags in a trash bin. I got up to check and turned on the light of the living room. A tiny mouse about 2\u201d long jumped out and raced across the room and disappeared under the sofa-bed. But this isn\u2019t limited to low cost hotels. On our visit to a very famous NYC museum we decided to have a bite to eat at one of the fast food areas. I ordered some hot chocolate and they gave me the cup so I could prepare it myself on a counter section that had coffee, milk, water and chocolate in small serving size packets. When I picked up the first chocolate packet, it seemed to be broken and powder was spilling out. I returned it and took a second which had the same problem. Upon close inspection I noticed that the first and second packets were not broken, the holes where made by some small rodent. The first 3 or four packets had the same type of hole in the same area. NYC seems to have a big problem with rodents. There\u2019s just to many places where they can hide and multiply. The building walls are hollowed; the basements have cable and pipe ducts that run under the streets and meet at junctions. It\u2019s an exterminator\u2019s nightmare. Conclusion The Hayden Hotel\u2019s best asset is its location. There space is limited and they try to make the best of it. They can fix it by making fewer rooms, thus making them larger, but then they would have to up the rates to compensate. For the price it\u2019s not a bad place to stay. The neighborhood is great and you can catch transportation close by to the major attractions. On my next NYC visit I will probably try The Lucerne, The Beacon or the Comfort Inn. They\u2019re in the same area. But I will not exclude the Hayden as an option because in spite of all the negative comments and lack of features mentioned above or in reviews by others, our stay was comfortable, pleasant and trouble free.", "Date": "June 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cWanna Taste of New York City?\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3497856", "Content": "First a disclaimer-I am not a friend of the management (as on some travel websites have deemed the reviews on \"Trip Advisor\" to be written by such folks). That being said, if you're a budget traveler, then the place is fine. If you're a tourist looking to be coddled, this not the place for you. And actually, if one is in NYC, you should not be spending one moment in your hotel room, except to sleep and write a few postcards! I highly recommend (if one can afford it) getting a room with your own private bath, though when I checked out the \"shared bathrooms\" they seemed clean if a little damp due to lack of venilation. As on previous reviews of the Hayden, they are still renovating the hotel, however, it was quiet during the time I stayed there (maybe too quiet--none of the NYC hustle and bustle). And this being the East as opposed to the West coast, people do smoke, so I would crack a window in your room--smoky air does come in from the hallway. My room was clean, had a queen size bed, nightstand, chair, iron with ironing board in a small closet, and a huge TV with cable (had an interesting view overlooking the typical postage stamp sized back yards). The staff was friendly, helpful, and accomodating, not only to myself, but to others staying at the hotel. The Hayden does have a great location: Central Park is right outside your door and the subway is a short walk away. I felt absolutely safe coming back from the Village late at night (or early in the a.m. as the case may be). Also, if one needs \"emergency\" clothing (luggage lost, or that dress doesn't seem right for the occasion), Filene's Basement is right on the corner at Broadway. Highly recommended for shopping bargins.

It was the only hotel in Manhattan under $500 (that wasn't completely scary) due to some huge convention. I knew this neighborhood was good. This is where Seinfeld was supposed to have been set and \"You've got mail\" was filmed in several locations near here. Within walking distance is just about anything you could want in terms of eating, shopping, sight-seeing. I booked through Expedia and they clearly were taking advantage of demand as the rate I paid was twice what the hotel literature showed. I called the hotel a few hours before arriving to verify my reservation and to check to see if my room was in the \"renovated\" section. She assured me that all but the first floor was done. The lobby is in terrible shape, so I'm sure they will fix that eventually. The elevator is old and scary but once you arrive upstairs it is not so bad. I walked down the stairs to avoid the scary elevator a couple of times and I could tell that each floor was not necessarily in the same shape, but close. The stairway is a mess. The 5th floor public areas were in good shape, the bathrooms were a very pleasant surprise. All new tile and fixtures/shower. You can lock the door and have it all to yourself. Shower/Toilet are in the same room. It was clean. There is another bathroom a few doors down so people shouldn't have to wait long. My room was a single and while I had a new sink in the room and the TV and dresser was new, the bed was not. It wasn't terrible, but slanted a bit. The linens are definitely not new, but they were clean. There was a cigarette hole in the bedspread, but the room smelled fine. You can hear people when they come in to the hallway outside of the room, but it wasn't extremely loud, and there are only a few rooms on each floor anyway, so for the most part, it was very quiet. 79th street isn't one of NY's busiest, so it's not loud like it would be if you were staying on Columbus or Broadway. Considering they claim they have renovated recently, and clearly they have done the bathrooms and some new things, they have not re-painted! I thought this was odd. My room had old banged up paint, as did the stairwells. If you pay less than $100 for this place, it would probably be a good deal. I only stayed here because of the sold out situation in the city.

After reading the reviews online, my girlfriend and I were jokingly referring to the hotel as \"Hades,\" but my 7 nights there weren't bad, considering the price/value and location--right there at Central Park West and close to the subway. Yes, the hotel is being renovated and shoddily at that, but the upper floors, anything above 5, are finished. So make sure you INSIST on getting a room on the 6th or 7th floors. My mother and I for some reason got one of the \"suites,\" which meant that we actually had a nice view and two interconnected rooms. Really pretty. The bathroom was also clean and functional. The only peeves are these: The noise outside. The walls are paper-thin, you hear every sound from the next room, and the hall reverberates with each step because of the wooden floors. The doors don't close unless you throw them shut. You really have to use violence. At one point I had to intervene in a marital tiff next door at around midnight. We could hear every word and after the woman yelled several times to let her go, I knocked on the door. The couple stopped fighting. Hooray. The radiator works whenever it wants to. It either doesn't work at all and stays cold or turns so hot that you can't touch it. At night it makes the strangest sounds, hissing and knocking. The desk staff is reasonably polite, but not excessively so. The woman who checked us out wanted to add another $10 to the cab fare and put it in her pocket, just for calling us a cab to JFK, so be sure to call your own cab. The fare is set at $45 plus $5 toll, so expect to pay $60 with tip. Stopping at the 4th floor and below, I saw a nasty in-progress renovation and shady people shuffling along the halls. Some strange characters seem to inhabit floors 1 through 3, permanent dwellers, it seemed. An upset English couple was telling us in the elevator that they had a mouse in their room on the 5th floor. They demanded a break on the room rate, but didn't get much sympathy, from what I could hear at the front desk. Bottom line: Hayden/Hades is a great value if you expect to get what you pay for.

The lobby and hallways are a little noisy and in need of remodeling but the place has great potential. The last night of our stay we did have a little problem. We brought dinner back to the room, ate and turned in early. At about midnight I woke up to a rustling sound in the bathroom. I remembered that we had thrown garbage (including 1/2 slice of pizza) in a plastic bag and placed it in the bathroom. My mind started processing this information and I started to freak out, imagining what type of creature could make this noise. I woke up my daughter and we lay there for a few minutes arguing over who would go see what was in the bathroom. I finally got up, grabbed an umbrella as a weapon and headed to the bathroom. I clapped my hands and a tiny mouse ran out of the bathroom around my feet. I jumped on the bed, screaming (EEK-a-mouse) and the mouse ran out under the door into the hall. I then put the garbage at the end of the hall. As you can imagine it was a little hard to fall back to sleep. Would I stay here again? Maybe- I loved the neighborhood and proximity to the park and the price is excellent. I would not leave food in the room.

The check in was quick and we took the little lift up to our twin room on the 4th floor - the hotel was still being decorated but didnt look to bad just need a lick of paint in the hallways! The room was fine - plain decoration, two comfy beds just right for resting our weary legs after a lond day sightseeing and a neat little bathroom with all you needed of and a nice big TV! Where the floors are wooden it was a bit echoey which did wake me up a few times on the first night as you could here people walking around and slamming doors! I learnt my lesson and wore earplugs the next night (from the airplane) and slept perfectly! It was nearly a little shop so we could buy bottles of water etc, just round the corner there was a lovely coffee shop and the subway was just a block away. Very convenient! After checking out Victor arranged for our luggage to be locked in a luggage room was was also very convenient as our flight wasnt until the evening and we wanted to do some more sightseeing!

I'm from the UK but lived and worked in nyc in 2001 but due to September 11, my parents were unable to come out and stay with me. So in April 2004 I saw a cheap deal for the Hayden and after reviewing their website, i thought it looked decent and booked it. Boy, was I wrong! When we arrived, just from looking at the lobby I knew i made a mistake. It smelt old and the furniture was worn out. The male receptionist was miserable and couldn't even find our reservation, which took over 30 mins to sort out. We booked for 2 double rooms but they stuck us in a room for 4 people consisting of a broken down looking pull out bed, faulty plugs, chipped rusty walls and doors, dirty carpets, a broken chair, a window which you are unable to open with a view of a brick wall and a sink in the main room! Now as I've said before, I've lived in new york and visited friends who lived in kinda run down areas but i've never seen a room like this. I even took pictures which i sent to the tour operator we booked with to show them what kind of hotel they were advertising and he sent me an apology e-mail as he was unaware of the condition of this hotel! It was so bad, we actually ended up spending our first night trying to look for another hotel to stay in! Overall, this hotel ruined, what was supposed to be, a fun trip from my family and we spent most of the time out on the streets as nobody wanted to go back to the hotel and we unable to find something else because it was easter and everywhere was booked. The only good thing i can say is thank god we didn't have to used the shared bathrooms because they were nasty and its obvious the cleaners don't really do their job and you can't complain to them either as the ones we saw didn't speak any english. The only people who we did discuss this with was the poor students that live at this hotel as they can't afford to live elsewhere. They all acknowledged that this place is a dump and that they shouldn't even advertise this place as a hotel, when in fact, its a broken down hostel so don't allow yourself to be fooled. Trust me, if you are travelling to New York, stayed in decent 2-3 star hotels before but wanna feel what its like to live in real poverty, this hotel is the prefect choice. But otherwise, spend a little bit extra on somewhere actually liveble! This hotel is a mess and needs to be knocked down.
