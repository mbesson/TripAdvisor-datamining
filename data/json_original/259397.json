The hotel is always great. The rooms are very nice, modern and classy. The hotel is a block off King St W so it is in the heart of the entertainment district and close to lots of restaurants and activities. On our most recent stay, we were there for two nights in their Executive Suite which is 1 bedroom plus a living room which has a pull out couch for our daughter. We are greeted by name when we come into the hotel, and the concierge knows his stuff. Lots of good restaurant recommendations. This is the first time we can say the bed was not comfortable. Every other time it has been great. But this would be our only complaint We have stayed at the Four Seasons and the Windsor Arms as well.

From the gorgeous blown glass flowers in the ceiling before the entrance, to the polished granite walls and floors and natural wood tones, it was beautiful. There appeared to be just a handful of other guests so it was very quiet. Our room faced an inner courtyard of sorts so no street noise. We saved a little money by parking in the pay lot directly across the street ($50 for w'end instead of $60-$75 at the hotel). The bedroom was a bit small but just fine for us. I loved the fawn colored velvet drapes with clean lines and the automatic open/close button for them by the bed. The bathroom was amazing as other reviewers had said. Granite and glass with a heated floor option and a floor light for a romantic bath. The closet area was like a walk in closet with blonde wood, a large mirror, and plenty of his/her space. Only downside was mattress was a bit creaky in one spot and one morning we heard squeal of water pipes briefly. We loved the breakfast buffet (a bit pricey at $22 but given how expensive Toronto is it was not so bad). They had a very limited amount of dim sum, made blueberry pancakes and great eggs (I had omelet with goat cheese and spinach), fantastic OJ, coffee and pastries.

The sheets and beds were extremely comfortable ( I have alot of joint problems so I'm picky) , clean and fresh. The room was extremely clean and felt more like being in your bedroom than a hotel room. ceiling details and art in the rooms helped with those touches. The bathroom was amazing!!!!! I'm always cold, so a heater in the bathroom with heated floors was a dream- truly! The bathroom was always extremely clean and the deep tub and shower were great. I will tell you that this room truly felt luxurious and not like an average hotel room. The service was truly wonderful and I'm a stickler for details. The greeters, concierage, restaurant staff and desk foks were extremely pleasant at all times and were extremely helpful finding /booking tickets, cars, etc. The food in the hotel was lovely- and I never usually eat in hotels, but it was rainy when we got in and gave it a try.

Our front desk agent was very courteous and the check-in process went smoothly. ROOM: Simply amazing. The sitting area and bathroom are separated from the bedroom by large sliding doors. There was a mini-bar with plenty of stock, and if you wanted to take the stuff out and use it as a fridge, it's easy to do as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not weight censored (at least our wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t). The entrance was very spacious with a place to sit and put your shoes on, very nice! Safe provided in a closet along with usual hotel amenities such as hair dryer. Bathroom: heated floor, floor light (great as a night light), large vanity area, shower separate from large soaker tub. Robes and slippers provided were a great addition. Sitting Area: A nice comfy couch with a coffee table and tv directly in front; great sitting area. A desk and chair are also provided for working and are located in a manner that make\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seeing the tv very easy. Bedroom: I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever slept with more comfortable sheets! Holy Boy they were awesome! There were light switches to turn on the bathroom light, to open/close drapes as well, and another flat screen tv to watch if desired. There was turn down service provided and they put a towel at the foot of your bed so you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to walk around on the hotel carpet with bare feet. Sweet! GYM: Great, many modern machines, dumbbells, smith machine, medicine balls and universal system with cable pulleys. Could also use the sun-deck to work out which allows for doing walking lunges, among other things. POOL: A decent lap pool, not deep, maybe 4 feet? HOT TUB: The tub was a great size, jets were fairly powerful, however, they weren't very well located as you could only get a jet up over the mid-back, not hitting the shoulders and also making it difficult to massage low-back. If the Jets were staggered this would improve the hot tub immensely. LOCATION: The hotel was in a great location. A pizzeria (Pizza Rustica) and breakfast diner (Cora's) are directly across the street. See our reviews of those two places as well. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a five minute walk to the Rogers Centre. Ample parking options are available either with the hotel or another of several nearby lots. One downside is the noise from the courtyard we heard. There was a party going on right under our window on the ground floor (we were 4 floors up). We only heard them twice, but could hear them nonetheless. Better windows might help, not sure. It wasn't that big of a deal but I could see this causing some issues for some. We typically stay at the Sheraton Centre every summer, however, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be looking at staying at the Soho if the price fits. We got a deal through wagjag/jaunt, so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure we could justify the regular room rate otherwise.", "Date": "October 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guelph, Canada", "Title": "\u201cSOHO Metropolitan through Wagjag.com\u201d", "Author": "PamGurdHughes", "ReviewID": "UR118859732", "Content": "We spent one night in the hotel while looking to buy a condo in Toronto.

We wanted a quiet, modern hotel with a boutique feel. We were very impressed by the attentive and polite service as soon as we arrived. When we pulled up our car to the front entrance, the concierge immediately helped us with our luggage and assisted us with the queue. Check-in was fine, although we had to wait about 20 minutes for our room to be ready. During our wait, we had a quick snack at Senses Bakery, which was a little expensive - one glass of wine, a slice of cheesecake and cafe latte cost a total of $30. Valet service, which costs $35 per night, was seamless. We got room #325. The view was a little disappointing overlooking a parking lot; however, we were happy with the modern decor and the washroom was fabulous. The washroom was enormous taking up half the room, featured stunning marble with heated floors, large bathtub and glass shower stall. Bathroom amenities were high-quality and plentiful. There was also a large open-concept closet area between the washroom and bed, which had a generous amount of hanger and shelf space. The minibar was well-stocked. The bed was very comfortable. There was turndown service in the evening, although there were no customary chocolates left on the bed. Either the walls were very thick, or there was no one staying next to us, because our room was extremely quiet - loved it! Unfortunately, the drapes were broken so we could not close them (some issue with the electrical switch). We informed the front desk and they had someone close them for us. However, we then could not open them. It was clear that this was a chronic problem in this room because the switch plate was very worn out, indicating several attempts had been made to repair the switch - obviously without success! Also, the switch operating the nightstand lights did not work. We had to unscrew the bulbs to turn off the lights. I think it must have been due to the same electrical issue as with the drapes.

Both times it has been for business. The first time was for four nights in the spring and this time was for 7 nights. It is a luxury class hotel and the services supports that ranking. The location of this hotel is fantastic if you're interested in walking to some of Toronto's more famous sites and neighborhoods. It's easy to get to the CN Tower, City Hall, the waterfront and Lakeshore areas, Chinatown, Queen Street, and the University of Toronto from the Soho Met. Walking in the neighborhoods around the hotel is safe and easy. The rooms are huge. And gorgeous. The beds are fantastic and truly I have never slept so well in a hotel. I particularly appreciate the bedside control panel for all the lights and the drapes in the room. No running around shutting things down--you just crawl under the duvet and control it all from bed. Wonderful. The heated floor in the bathroom is a fantastic feature. I did have trouble this stay with hot water not being reliable, but the courteous staff was attentive to the problem. There were a couple of little problems this stay that were handled efficiently by the staff. The hotel gym is very nice and has a lap pool in addition to cardio machines and plenty of weight lifting options. The hours for the weekend are inconvenient--but during the week the access is fairly good. Probably my only complaint about the hotel is the astronomical cost of room service considering the minimal portion sizes and the lower quality of food than what is served in the restaurant (at the same prices). The Senses restaurant in the hotel is quite delicious and it's suggested that the same food is offered for room service, but I don't find that to be true. The upcharge on room service is $5 per order plus a hefty service fee and there is nothing exceptional about it. For the prices they are charging, I would expect a higher quality meal with sides like bread and/or fruit and not just the one dish listed. Compared to say a Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton room service presentation the Soho Met has a long way to go. Most of the time when I tried to reach room service during this most recent stay I got the voice mail. My colleague had a problem with room service the last time we were there as well. It seems to be more of an issue with dinner service than breakfast, as another colleague reported no issues or complaints with breakfast services. I just found it underwhelming and disappointing.

I have stayed here on a few occassions and whenever I do, I always feel pampered thus it is a real treat. I was in a deluxe king bed. The staff were helpful, friendly and accommodating. The electronic blinds and do not disturb button provide nice, modern convenience. They have a nice little clock radio that provides soothing sound options as well as a small selection of songs and a built in i-pod connection for your own music. The TV is a large screen and the headboard is padded. The closet is a large walk in area with plenty of storage. The bathroom is one of the finer points as it is all marble (with heated floors) and a glass enclosed shower with great water pressure. The room is not large but with an office desk and the entertainment unit, it is sufficient. I often have trouble sleeping in hotels due to noise waking me (even through earplugs) but I find this hotel is nice and quiet. You also have a window that opens. They allowed me a late check out at 3pm so that was great. There is a mini bar but I move things out to use it for my own beverages. I had room service and the spaghetti bolognese was a little dry in that there is more meat than sauce and the noodles were al dente. The home made chocolate cookies tasted more like chocolate than cookie. That was $44 for pasta and cookies (incl tax/tip). I recommend the breakfast as was quite yummy with real potatoes and real orange juice. It was $37 (incl tax/tip) and it included juice and coffee. Internet service is included and you have wi-fi or dsl option. Note, parking is an extra $30 with in/out access and that price is rather common downtown. The location is great as it is right across from the Rogers centre with lots of restaurants and bars within close proximity. Every time I have gone I have missed the pool (this time was closed for maintenance and although the next day it was available, I opted for a bath instead). If I could change anything about this hotel it would be that I would want a larger tub as although the marble enclosure is large the tub is just a bit larger than regular size. I also would like it if the fan was more powerful as the halogen and vanity lighting put off a lot of heat thus I find the washroom is always warm when I am trying to get ready. I would also opt for a better matress. Their's is certainly sufficient and it was quite comfy however it is not as nice as the ones at the Marriott (which have my favourite). Also, I like that their pillows are a good size and there are four however I would prefer if they had a couple of feather options instead of the foam that they use. Overall it is my favourite place to stay in Toronto and it is better than most places I have stayed at in North America other than world class resorts. I think it is a little pricey but when you consider the service level and how luxurious it is, it is well worth it and I know that in comparison to other hotels in the area, it is a much better value for what you get. Compare discounted weekend rate of $215 with low end hotels such as Travel Lodge and Super 8 that are going for about $150 there is zero comparison.", "Date": "August 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cBest hotel in Toronto.\u201d", "Author": "rachelhannah1996", "ReviewID": "UR37776586", "Content": "At the beginning of my Summer Vactaion my freind and I singed up for an art camp at the Ontaior College of Art.

Pros: The SoHo was walking distance of OCAD/AGO, Queen Street (great shopping), China Town, CN Tower and the Skydome (formally known as the Rogers Center). The SoHo is also a condo complex, with a seperate entrance and lobby. The concearge showed my mom some beautiful units and also gave us a chance to explore the SoHo's penthouse where Canda's Next Top Model was filmed and many celebs (such as Justin Timberlake, Usher, Black Eyed Peas, Pink and Lady Gaga) have stayed.

The staff \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which made every effort to get to know us personally \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is really terrific: friendly people, interesting personalities, well-trained, articulate and intelligent, responsive plus prompt.

The bathroom is super, a beautiful tub for relaxing after a stressful drive, and a great shower to get started for the next day! When I returned to the hotel in the evening, the turn-down service had been done, there was quiet classical music playing, drapes drawn, and a complimentary bottle of water by the bed. The hotel was generally quiet until about 8:45 AM when a cacophony of doors slamming suddenly started up and in many cases it seemed to be the same door! Housekeeping should be more aware of that sound than they appeared to be. Check-in was easy, the concierge was very attentive and good at his job. The view was so-so but I could see the CN Tower!

Breakfast was a buffet in the attached bakery/coffee stand. It wasn't terribly busy, but still service was prompt. Food was fine. The bar was pretty lively early in the evening, part of the reason being that it was also the waiting area for their restaurant. Later that evening the paced had slowed down considerably. Location is great - right in the core, walking distance or short cab ride from most things you'd need or want to do. Airport is about 20 mins by cab in no traffice (considerably longer in traffic).

The best rate I could find was on the hotel's website. We arrived on the VIA railway from Montreal, and walked the 5 or 6 blocks to the hotel. It's on the edge of downtown, but only a few short blocks to the CN tower which is next door to the Rogers Center. Toronto is a very easy city to enjoy on foot, and the transit system is terrific. We checked in at 3 p.m. and to our delight found we had been upgraded from a deluxe king room to a \"luxury\" king room--the difference being we now had a dressing area and a soaking tub. Our room, 302, was spacious and tastefully furnished, sleek and modern, and looked out over the courtyard. The king bed was deliciously comfortable, but the pillows were quite firm. However you can request whatever pillows you prefer through the concierge ( we didn't bother). There was lots of storage in the dressing area and in the marble clad bathroom. Plush bathrobes, towels and linens were provided as well as Molton Brown toiletries. There are switches at bedside that control room lights, bathroom lights, the curtains, and you can control the do not disturb/housekeeping requests from there, too. The heated floor in the bathroom has its own switch if you don't want it in the summer. There are 2 phones in the room and one in the bathroom, where there is also a speaker with volume control so you can hear what's on the TV in the bedroom. They've really thought of everything, and I felt the price we paid was an excellent value for what we got, especially with the upgrade. The staff was very polished, and the concierge got instant results when I requested a coveted table at nearby Canoe restaurant. There is a highly rated restaurant at the hotel (closed the Monday night we arrived) and Sen5es (sic) cafe off the lobby provides a *gourmet* breakfast buffet (about $23 per person) that we enjoyed once. It included hot dishes, smoked salmon, fresh fruit, some remarkably good dim sum (!), granola parfaits, and pastries from their bakery where you can also purchase decadent desserts and confections. We were treated to turn down service each night, and we never heard our neighbors. When the curtains are drawn, they effectively block out daylight. The wet bar is fully (and expensively) stocked, but they provide bottled water gratis with the evening visit. We walked everywhere from here. It was mostly a sports pilgrimage for my husband to visit the hockey hall of fame and the Rogers Center which were presented in such a way as to hold my interest as well. Though the Soho is on the edge of downtown, it's very pleasant to be a short walk away from the very busy tourist scene. We had an excellent breakfast at Cora's which resides on the corner diagonal from the Soho; there is a convenience market directly across the street for Maple Cream cookie cravings, and a large pharmacy at the end of the block for other sundries. It was a supremely serene and modern setting to return to at the end of each day where we were treated royally and easily tempted to return.

The SoHo is one block north of Front Street on the western side of the downtown core. It was a nice 10 minute walk to get to Bay and Yonge where my meetings were (as opposed to a 3 or 4 minute walk from the Royal York). What I love about the SoHo however, is that it is a smallish hotel, no where near the size of the Royal York and because of that there was much more personalized attention. After I checked in, I went across the street to Wayne Gretzky's bar to have a beer while I watched the hockey game and when I came back the concierge greeted me by name - which is the sort of personalized touch that is so great with a boutique hotel. The restaurant in the hotel (Senses?) was very good if not a bit pricey, especially if you are not on an expense account. The mix of people in the hotel seemed to be business travellers, youngish \"hipsters\" and Europeans (met a nice guy from Paris who was in town with his girlfriend on business). No kids evident. The rooms were larger than I would expect and the bathrooms were amazing, so far above Royal York level I couldn't even compare them - huge walk-in with a heated floor and top notch toiletries. The bed linen was great (easily compares to Westin/Hyatt level of beds) and I liked the novelty of the auto-blinds. As has been noted in previous reviews, my view (I was on the 6th floor I think) was of a building under-construction, but which appeared to be close to completion - looks like a condo. I was never bothered by any noise. This area is a very trendy with lots of high end condos around. There is a parking lot adjacent as well. Reading through the reviews, I am surprised to see no one commented on the great night-time views of the big building lights. I quite liked that. Also, it was one block away from King St (lots of restaurants and theatres) and about 3 blocks from Queen St (lots of shops). One block from the Rogers Centre (Blue Jays games) and two blocks from the CN Tower. You are right smack in the middle of the downtown hustle and bustle, don't expect a stunning view of the lake and you will not be disappointed. I really liked the area and will be returning when I come back to Toronto on business.", "Date": "August 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Devizes, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLocation, location...but no view\u201d", "Author": "Craven", "ReviewID": "UR5593938", "Content": "I do not think you could find a better location than this in Toronto.

This room is smaller than most and right next to the lifts which have the loudest bell tones I have ever heard so avoid if you want a good sleep. I got moved to one further down the corridoor and found it very adequate. There are good working facilities with plenty of light, a comfy bed and a large TV with numerous channels and film options. The bathroom was excelent and there is plenty of hanging space for ones clothes in a seperate area. The public areas are very pleasant in a boutique kind of way. There is a trendy bar with excelent staff and a very adequate dining room. Breakfasts are nothing to write home about but again quite adequate. If you want to find somewhere not too expensive (but top quality) to eat try just around the corner at the cafe/restaurant called Spoon. I stumbled upon it and had a memorable meal.

The bakery also in the lobby serves a wonderful gourmet self serve breakfast/brunch for about 22 can (i think).. The luxury room was $198 can. and in my opinion, well worth the quality and location.

The rooms are very large and the walk in closet configuration should be adopted by more hotels along with the ample bathrooms.

From locating a movie theater and show times for us, to enjoyable conversation in the bar - the staff was a true joy.

First of all, we agreed that the room itself was one of the best non-suite rooms we'd ever stayed in, if not the best. The marble bathroom was amazing with heated floors, plenty of lights and storage, a deep soaking/whirlpool tub that was great after exploring the city all day, and a glass enclosed, two shower-head shower (see picture - sorry about quality). The king bed was very comfortable, and the room was quite spacious - enough to hang out in or rest in without feeling claustrophobic. The location was great for summer explorers; it was only a couple of blocks from Queen Street, King Street, Gardinier Expy, Rogers Field, and there were many great restaurants within easy walking distance, which really simplified our evenings. Parking, while always expensive in larger cities, was not unreasonable, and the secured garage was clean, well-lit, and convenient to the hotel (park and take an elevator up one floor to the lobby). Additionally, my wireless internet connection for my laptop worked from the room for no charge (this was luck - try it and see if yours works, if not, you can purchase a cable for $10). For a warm weather trip, we would stay there again without hesitation. Having said that, there are some things which should be pointed out: (1) For the cost-conscious: If you enjoy a cocktail or five in the evenings, and don't want to leave the hotel, be prepared to spend a small fortune in the hotel bar - if I recall correctly, a moderate quality glass of wine cost $14 CAN. This was easily remedied as there is a small establishment (Pizza Rustico) across the street where we went each evening and were able to purchase a 1/2 liter of our favorite wine for slightly less. (2) For the cost-conscious: The hotel offers very few inexpensive alternatives (i.e. I'm cheap, and this hotel is not). The bakery, the mini bar in the room, the restaurant etc. were comparatively some of the most expensive I've seen. Once again, because of the location, this was easily solved by a 5 minute walk. There is a breakfast place across from the hotel that served wonderful breakfasts at a reasonable cost. We are adventurous diners, and given the number of interesting restaurants so close to us, we did not try the hotel bakery or restaurant, though we were told numerous times they were excellent by non-hotel staff. (3) The front door service was inconsistent. Sometimes there was a doorman, sometimes not. Sometimes they opened the door, sometimes not. Upon our arrival, we had to go inside to find someone to ask about parking as no doorman was present, which made for a poor first impression. We were told to park in the garage below the hotel, which we did. Upon arriving in the lobby with all of our bags, we were THEN asked if we needed assistance. I suppose we could have gone up, gotten a bellman, brought him down to the car to get our belongings, and then returned to the lobby, but that seems a little bizarre to me. (4) The hallways in the hotel looked a little run down because of the carpeting - there are large squares in the carpet with are fraying at the seams. Without getting into details, it made us a little concerned that this hotel was past its heyday and made the place look a little beat up. Our concerns disappeared upon reaching the room which was immaculate. (5) Views. The hotel is on the first few floors of the building only. If you are hoping for a skyline view, or some other extremely scenic view, you will be disappointed. Our view was of the building across the street, and a little ways in either direction, but it was fine, if not scenic. There are plenty of places to go in the city if you want a scenic view, and just traveling around the city will give you several views. We felt the room quality was more important than the view.

White fluffy linens (a few more pillows would have been nice). Great artwork, a large TV (that pulled out and swiveled for viewing from the bed) and a few chic extras like push button drapes, dimmable lighting and a do not disturb/housekeeping button. A small minibar with drinks, coffeemaker and munchies came in handy (at a price). There is a market across the street if you don't want to partake of a $3.50 can of Coke. The bathroom is to-die-for. Light oak wooden shelves, a bench and a safe in the dressing area held everything we brought. Fluffy robes and lots of hangars, plus big drawers make it a closet you'd love to have every trip. The bathroom itself is large but not overly so (a separate toilet room would have made it perfect). Marble floor heated on command, and the bathtub is huge. The glass shower is regular size, but with two shower heads. The toiletries were very luxurious. A lighted makeup mirror was a nice touch, but a stool to sit on while applying makeup would have made it easier to use. All in all, a very nice room. Our only disappointment was that the air conditioner would never get quite cool enough, even at it's lowest setting. Perhaps it was the record breaking heatwave outside. The Senses bakery was pretty and very convenient, although everything seemed a bit too \"over-the-top\" in presentation and exotic spices.
