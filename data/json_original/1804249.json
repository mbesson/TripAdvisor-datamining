The construction is just outside the entrance to the hotel We were disappointed by this and elected not come back to the hotel upon our return to Istanbul at the end of our trip. Strongly suggest that you inquire about the construction and insist upon a room on the non-entrance side of the hotel. Some members of our group did not experience any of the problems we had.

The hotel & the tour was less expensive than just the hotel stay at the Ottoman Imperial. So, you can understand why this is such a value package albeit not your fancy hotel. The room size was just about the same as Econolodge in the states & 1/2 of a typical US hotel. There was a desk, closet, & good air conditioning, but the bathroom was small, dimly lit, & very basic. It was comfy enough for sleeping but not for hanging around or having visitors. The common space is also small, with one sofa & two chairs. The hotel has been refurbished and things look new but small & tight. We stayed in the new section, which had very narrow halls & is accessed through a tiny path through the restaurant. The elevator is a strange two person-at-a-time thing with no door. Keep your hands to your side! The included breakfast was not geared to American tastes & the seating was very limited. Everything pretty much came out of a can or were dry goods, except for two warm dishes and cheeses. Beverages included unusually strong Turkish tea & cranberry juice. The front desk was very helpful & had to be called on several times to figure out how to work the safe in the room. No instructions, hidden buttons, & strange keying had some of our party giving up on the device. Language was not a problem. Although the neighborhood had been disparaged by our travel agent, we loved the old town. It feels very Istanbul & plenty colorful. It was within walking distance of all of the attractions we visited except Asiatic Istanbul & a night club show, both of which were parts of our tour. There were lots of small shops for sundries & snacks, & many lower cost restaurants. The streets are narrow & organically laid out, about the same as old towns in Italy. We felt totally safe & although there were many shuttered buildings, the area was vibrant and not blighted. My guess is that this hotel is heavily booked by tour companies because of its low cost, good location (near sights), & adequate everything else. When we checked availability, there were no rooms in the Sept 2011 time frame but our tour booked us in immediately. The tour company must reserve large blocks of time. If you get a chance to book the room yourself, it is a good choice if you don't plan to stay in your room much & are willing to go out for breakfast occasionally.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland Central, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cVery helpful staff and excellent central position.\u201d", "Author": "sweetpeapb1", "ReviewID": "UR119773697", "Content": "Stayed 1 night prior to going on a tour and although we checked out at 10am we were made to feel welcome using the restaurant and outdoor seating as well as lobby till we departed at 8pm.

I was very frustrated and not pleased to hear this as I had taken the time to confirm our reservation more than once fearing this type of misfortune. In the end, the manager told us to take a taxi and he would cover the cost (which he did but it took some time and the taxi driver did not seem happy with the end result - but of course since they were conversing in Turkish we did not understand a thing.) They found us room in their Q-Inn hotel Old city which we were not pleased about at first since we did not think it was in as good a location.

The bathroom was having some leaking problems from the toilet as well as the shower which was concerning since the hotel was not even a year old when we stayed there. The staff was very friendly (however sometimes the english was extremely limited, the manager when you could get a hold of him (as he managed both hotels) did speak good English.) We felt that the price of the hotel was good value since it was comfortable and clean and we had free airport transfer to and from the airport.

At the end, it was a terrific place to stay. For the same price (even lower, as Seda gave us special discounted rates at 65 euro per person per night) we got wonderful, spacious, quite, clean rooms with new furniture, solid beds and normal bathroom with a DOOR and NO toilet chair in the shower cabin (opposite to what we were offered at Historical Preferred), nice breakfast, top location, extremely helpful and understanding staff, cheap airport transfer.

We stayed there once when we landed in Istanbul and decided to stay again when we came back to Istanbul from the 5 days tour of turkey before we departed. I have already recommended this hotel to many people. Also, their location is ideal for tourists and everything is close by, especially the old city and very close to tram station as well. It is not a 5 star hotel so one should not go with that expectation but it is great value for money in the boutique hotel category and i would rank it high up in its class. It is very safe and the most important thing is a friend in a foreign country which you will surely find in their staff and especially their manager Mr. Sener who gave us his personal attention in every small matter.

Strange thing is that I phoned up asking if they had room but they told me they were completely full and actually overbooked. But minutes later I checked on the internet (booking-com) and it said they had rooms. So I booked and when I arrived everything was fine. Very strange... The hotel is relatively new. This is not a luxury hotel. But it is very clean, modern and has everything you would expect from a quality hotel except they don't have irons and ironing boards. They will send your laundry out to get done, and that service is pretty quick. A few hours usually. I was on fifth floor. The view is terrible. A building site basically. But you don't stay here for the view. You should stay here because the location is excellent! You are very close to the Sirkeci and Gulhane tram stations.Also very close to Eminonu ferry ports and the best thing in Istanbul, the Topkapi Palace, is very close too. Shower and WC is small, but adequate. Double Rooms are a good size. Lots of wardrobe space. Room has a safe. Wifi on 5th floor was a bit poor.Wifi on 4th floor was much better and faster. Restaurant is simple but very good. Staff there are very very friendly. And the restaurant has good wifi too. Menu is limited but what they do offer is very good quality and reasonable prices. I would recommend eating in the restaurant here rather than go out to the local cafes and restaurants. Breakfast is also simple but good. Only one lift is available and it is not big, but it always seems available when you need it. Aircon was broken in my room. Not a problem as the weather was neither hot nor cold so I didnt need the aircon. Overall this is a great hotel. But keep in mind that getting to it will be difficult. It is in a pedestrianised area, so taxis cannot get you there. Best thing to do is ask them to take you to the Sirkeci or Gulhane tram stations and then walk from there.
