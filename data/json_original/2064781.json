Our reservation was confirmed by email of course..By coincidence just 2 days before our departure I wrote them an email asking if they can arrange us a shuttle bus from the airport and the answer was that our reservation did not exist anymore because a person of the staff made a mistake and overbooked the rooms,and we weren't even informed!!! I told him that I will not accept this and that it is a high season and it will be very difficult for us to find a hotel last minute!!! He answered that will help me with booking at another hotel and gave me the link of it to look. I asked if the price was the same and I never got an answer even if I wrote him 3 emails.... Be careful with this hotel, they don't look after their guests....they could ruin our vacation...", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vila Praia de Ancora, Portugal", "Title": "\u201cGood location\u201d", "Author": "Clara114", "ReviewID": "UR120147174", "Content": "The location is really good: 2 minutes walk from the tram which takes you anywhere in the city (3-4 stops) or 20minutes walk from the main touristic attractions. The staff was always helpful, breakfast had a lot of variety (continental breakfast with many Turkish dishes too) and the room was very clean. The only downside is on the size of rooms - very small. We booked a double room with an extra bed and there was barely space to walk or put our luggage in. The next day, we requested for a bigger room and it was OK if we'd fold in the extra bed every morning. The extra bed wasn't comfortable at all and very old.", "Date": "November 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Istanbul, Turkey", "Title": "\u201cThey are not professional!\u201d", "Author": "ist-tripper", "ReviewID": "UR118941300", "Content": "Firstly, I'm Turkish ,studying in Istanbul.My Dutch fiance visites me every 3 months in Istanbul and that time he chose to book this hotel.However, the hotel itself made us so regretful to choose them! As soon as we got to the hotel, one of the staff asked us if we were married and later on said that their boss didn't want unmarried couples to stay at the hotel. That I don't understand,they didn't make a note neither on their website nor on booking.com or wherever.They sell their rooms on international websites but you know the reality on your arrival which is really dissapointing.We stayed around 10 random hotels in that area without any problem! Afterwards the staff told me they could note us as friends but after saying this somehow he changed his mind! I even told them I wouldn't stay at nights!But still their behaviour was real rude towards me! We booked a double room because we were together all day long for 5 days and had nowhere to be alone and speak for a while and having breakfast every morning.The thought of the staff about this was really so ill-mannered! The most stupid thing about the hotel that, they let froeign-froeign unmarried couples stay, but if one of them is Turkish,they don't! I find it a big discrimination! If they are very conservative, I advice them not to let any unmarried couples stay at their hotel and making a note about this on every website they have registered themselves.Because this way it's very rude and ridiculus! Because it was high season,most of the hotels were already full so we wanted them to book one nearby. They found a hotel and told us it was a good hotel ,we had to accept because of not having any chance!But the hotel was not we wanted and at check out we payed that hotel more than the staff at aspalace said!So you are liar too! I just wrote here to let you know more about this hotel.Avoid it!The reason we chose the hotel was its closeness to the subway station, for me to go back my dormitory at nights.and 3 star hotel is enough if you spend your time mostly outside. We knew that we wouldnt be accepted to the hotel on arrival and I noticed the hotel still hasn't made a note.So, I hoped I could help you.Believe me there are many hotels with their polite staff and in a better place in that area!Don't book here if you don't wanna take risk have a ruined holiday!", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rome, Italy", "Title": "\u201cAvoid this one\u201d", "Author": "silentmouse s", "ReviewID": "UR118384293", "Content": "The hotel is located in a dirty and noisy area.

There is access to public transportation (tram, buses) or someone could walk. The hotel is quite small and the room we had very small. Yet, it was clean and recently renovated. There is wireless Internet access for each floor, but unfortunately it was not working on our floor. I informed the staff at the reception about this, but until our departure the issue hadn't been resolved. There is some noise from the nearby roads, especially in the mornings, which could sometimes be annoying. The staff is very friendly and helpful. They responded eagerly to each of our requests, giving us information. The breakfast is decent, although nothing spectacular. The highlight is the stuffed pancakes with white cheese. They are absolutely fabulous. If you plan to go by car, bear in mind that there is no hotel-owned parking place; you either leave the car in front of the hotel on a very narrow street during the weekends, or a staff member can take it to a private parking space nearby during weekdays. The latter of course comes to a cost.", "Date": "March 25, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Aspalace Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d2064781-Reviews-Aspalace_Hotel-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$72 - $674*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Gumruk Emini Sok. 8, Laleli - Fatih</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Istanbul</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Turkey</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "2064781", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/70/dc/70dcda720c7175d302f5b63d435546ca2large.jpg"}}
