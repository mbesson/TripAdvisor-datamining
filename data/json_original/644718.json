{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Excellent hospitality I have been there for two weeks within July of 2008 with my family, my wife, two kids and my wife's parents. The excellent service, nice people, good food, warm hospitality can describe very well the hotel. We stayed for two weeks and we reccomend it 100% to everybody. It is located in a tranguil surrounding, just 20 mins from Barcelona and 3 mins from the highway for people who want to escape easily to other destinations avoiding the traffic of big city. The restaurant is really exquisite. The breakfast is sth we enjoyed as it was not the usual british breakfast we are acustomed to. It was rather traditional spanish with various local sausages and cheeses as well as home made bread. Enriq who is the owner's son, even fixed a mechanical problem i had with my car!!Thank u Teresa, Enriq, Christina, Sira, Louis, Dolores and Jorzef for all u did for us. I am sure we will return in the future", "Date": "Jul 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR664956963", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "costasna"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d644718-r18367034-Can_Rafel_Golf_Hotel-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "HotelID": "644718", "Price": "$51"}}
