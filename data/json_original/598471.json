{"Reviews": [{"Content": "an ok option I stayed at their single room in early June this year. In genral, nothing too bad or too good about it. Room itself is just like most of the Japanese business hotel rooms--clean, but small (this one is even smaller than,say, Toyoko Inn, a popular business hotel chain in Japan.) It's not my first time in Japan but I must say the size is really small. The bathroom is, again, as those standard business hotel--kind of like an all-in-one bathroom installation. You have it all but it's all in mini size. But again, this is not unusual in Japan anyway. For the price you pay ( I paid in average less than 7,000 yen per night, booking directly from their website), you can't expect too much. It doesn't mean that I was disappointed at it. Location-wise, it's quite convenient. Situated between two subway station ( Kodenmacho station and Ningyocho station on Hibiya Line, closer to the former, about 3-4 min walk and the latter 5 min walk). The area itself is quite quiet as a business/residential area. Nothing for tourist but it's convenient with the subway. There's a 24-hour convenient store and a 24-hour restaurant (Yoshinoya, a Japanese chain restaurant for beef rice). The hotel staff doesn't speak too much English. I asked for a non-smoking room with internet but they told me I could only get one smoking room with internet. I am not sure whether all of the room with internet are smoking or whether there're non-smoking room with internet unavailable during my stay? I was a bit disappointed at this as I don't like the smoking smell. But for the free internet, I had to endure the smell which u'd get used to after a while....Otherwise, everything is ok with this hotel. Whether I'd return again, probably not. It's not because it's bad. It's simply because there're so many similar hotels in Tokyo. I'd like to try a different area next time. But if you have to stay in the area, this is not a bad option.", "Date": "Jul 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR860299896", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "bigvoyageur"}, {"Content": "great location and pleasant stay a great location with 2 subway stations less than 5 min walking distsnce. the room is good sized for one person ( i stayed in a single room), clean sheets every day, small television with all the japanese channels. good bathroom with special toilet to wash you 'backside', excellent shower, instant warm water and all the tooth brush and toothpaste, shampoo supplied. very friendly staff, they let me leave my lugguage at the office coz my plane was 8pm at night. Try to not stay in the room right next to the lift, as the room cleaning staff can be quite chatty in the morning around 8am, if you want to get up after 8am, try to get a room far away from the lift. overall its a great hotel, lots of restaurant such as 'sushi train', 'remen and dumpling' restaruant everywhere. I paid $75 per night.", "Date": "Jan 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR576448831", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Jenny0078"}, {"Content": "Pleasent, comfortable and clean       View from across the road", "Date": "Jan 23, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR335525740", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "djy"}, {"Content": "\u7f0d\u6d2a\u7c35\u9287\ue042\u5127\u9289\u55d0\u5137\u9287\u0441\u4eda       \u74a7\u3083\u4e9c\u9288\u59d0\u5120\u9288\u00b0\u5157\u9287\u5c7b\u4eb1\u9288\u5fcb\u4e9c\u9287?/a>", "Date": "Jul 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR812081422", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "\u9287\u5098\u4f08\u9288?> \u9287\u5098\u4f08\u9288?</a> </div>"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066444-d598471-r18330218-Horidome_Villa-Chuo_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "598471", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
