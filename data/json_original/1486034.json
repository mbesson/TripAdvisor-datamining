The main reason I was staying at this hotel was because we wanted to go to the parade on Sunday, and wake up close and not have to fight traffic. Sunday we were to check out, go to the parade, and then check into another hotel to then continue touring Boston. The majority of my bad review is due to the properties lack of ability to managing problems in the hotel. I understand that I checked into this hotel on St. Patricks day (read: party) weekend, but this is no reason for me to expect that parties would be allowed in guest rooms. I stayed on the 9th floor, and down the hall maybe two doors was a significant party happening. People in and out of the room all night, into 5am. Very loud. Called down to front desk to explain the problem, to be told that they would take care of the situation. This was certainly not something they took care of. Neither of us slept very much all night, making the parade something neither of us wanted to do in the morning. Because of this, we skipped it and continued to our next destination for sleep, even though the parade was the reason we stayed at this hotel. You check into a hotel like The W in an effort to get a good nights sleep. It's an upscale hotel, not a Motel 6, you expect more from them in terms on responsiveness to problems. Additionally, the bathroom set up is a mess. I've stayed in plenty of hotels with \"open concept\" bathrooms, but this hotel really misses the mark. There is no way to turn on the light in the closed toilet without turning on a light that is visible from the bedroom area. This means when someone gets up to use the restroom in the middle of the night, they virtually have to turn on a light in the bedroom to do so. If sleep is important to you, I'd think about looking elsewhere. Anyone can give you a good nights sleep when everything goes right, but when something goes wrong you want a hotel that takes care of the problems.

We thanked her and told her what a lovely restaurant it was. I left without telling her that we ate there twice because it was sooo good!

Our room looked just like an Aloft or Element - both Aloft and Element are great but that is because you get what you pay for...no frills but clean with Ikea decor. The pros: Location is great! Very close to a lot of the sights and great places to eat. The Cons: Our bathroom was dirty (especially the toilet seat...gross!!), our internet connection (which you have to pay for) was spotty at best, and they tried to charge me for a 1-800 call despite the front desk telling me it was free. When I brought it to the woman at the front desk's attention she tried to challenge me. It was not the $2.00 that I cared about rather the misinformation followed by the challenge. These aren't \"end of the world\" complaints (well maybe the toilet) but when you add them all up it is enough to make you think, \"I won't book here again\" - particularly with all the choices in Boston.

The hotel is dark, hip and very modern which is typical of the W Hotels but this one looked worn already.

The floors are like glass without mats and so she put a hand towel down but it slipped right from under her. She hit her head on the trash can on the way down and we had to go the emergency room of Tufts Medical Christmas eve morning. The hotel wouldnt let us use their car service but instead wanted to call for an ambulance to go 2 blocks. We declined the ambulance and asked them to drive us. They said no and that they would get us a taxi . They sent security to help us but they could do nothing but give us bandages to stop the bleeding long enough to get her dressed to go to the hospital. We got to the hospital ourselves and when we returned two hours and 10 stiches later NOT ONE PERSON asked us how My Aunt was doing or even acknowledged that anything had happened. Not the manager, desk staff, doorman, NO-ONE. In fact NO-ONE except security and someone from housekeeping even came to our room.

It was very large with a cleverly designed separate work area behind the bed which felt like a little office unto itself. There was a comfy sitting area in the sharp glass corner over looking the city and the extremely comfortable king bed faced two exposures of glass (basically all of the exterior walls of the room are floor to ceiling windows) so laying in bed you felt like you were in some multi-million dollar modern apartment in the sky; not bad! The bathroom was large with separate WC, shower and tub, nice amenities and good strong hot water. Ample closet space, excellent soundproofing, etc. Service was excellent. Room service was quick and the food was great every meal I had (incl. breakfast and dinner). The bar downstairs is hopping pretty much every night of the week but if you want to avoid it, just go to your nice quiet room. Finally, the location is very good.

Arrival & check-in were quick & easy. We headed up to our room (5th floor), put the key in and began to open the door - when someone in the room yelled \"I'm busy!\". Surprised... we shut the door and went back to the reception desk. Side note: Prior to our arrival - I had e-mailed the hotel (at their invitation) twice - asking for a low floor room and early check-in. I had not received a response by the time we arrived. I have done the same with the Westin and the Sheraton and always received a response. They gave us another room (12th floor), citing a computer glitch. They offered us two drink tickets at the bar and to credit our SPG account 1,000 points. The rooms are very nice - although I think they try too hard to be hip & trendy. There is an appearance of quality - but in reality, there are chinks in that armour... e.g. the towel hanger pulls out of the wall, the soap dishes in the shower are loose, the light switch on the lamp falls off.... small silly stuff, but a series of these things gives a sense of lack of quality. That being said - the BEST part about the room is the bed & the sheets. Super comfortable and cozy!!! No quality skimping there, which - in a hotel is critical, The room was very clean, as well. No complaints there. On other reviews I had read about the wierd bathroom - and I agree that is one area where the attempt to be hip & trendy went a bit too far. What wasn't clear to us from other reviews is that the toilet is actually separated from the shower & sink area by a door. Some of the reviews made it sound like there was no door - only a screen. We made use of the Acura Experience - which was super convenient and our driver was great! Upon returning to the hotel at night - we asked the bar for bottled water for our drink tickets - and were told that the two tickets only equaled one bottle of water?!? So, that's what we took - but it seemed really bizarre. The bar was packed at midnight - with a very young, noisy crowd. Check out is as 12, which is nice with the option of a 4PM late check-out for no additional fee - also a nice beefit - not sure if that is specific to Starwood members or not...

So forget about your night's sleep or using the lobby bar for a nice drink or some bar food.No space. You need to recluse yourself in your room and ask for room service (very limited menu). So you are a prisoner in your own room. A hotel with bouncers, need I say more? Location is very good, right in the Theater district, but that also means noise. Thursday and Friday nights were particularly bad around 2 am when the lines of people to get in and out the W lobby bar, were very very noisy, waking me up both nights. I was on a lower floor facing the main entrance, so I guess that other rooms will be less noisy. Front Staff very helpful but they have a problem with cleaning Staff. It appears that there is no supervision after rooms are made and they are not very thorough.

The bathroom is great with separate toilet room. Classy. The desk behind the bed is more a design excuse than a desk. It is so crowded you cannot even place your laptop on the desk. I guess the hotel is for trendy types more than business people, leisure rather than business. If you are looking to party in style, then this is your hotel, but if you are going for business there are better alternatives.

Had called around to other hotels in the area to get details on internet speeds and never received a call back or were shoveled off to voicemails that never got returned. Booked here specifically because the staff made every effort to answer our initial inquiries before we were guests. And after booking, they took care of our additional bandwith and production requests without making it feel like we were asking for something obnoxious. Thank you to Joe for helping us out! I'm in Boston only a few times a year for business, but we most definitely will be staying here again on the next trip.

Concierge and check-in was smooth and friendly. The room was average size with an Ikea modern look. I've stayed in Hilton's with larger rooms. I'm not a big fan of modern design because I think most of it is not user friendly. My first issue when entering the room was the lighting. It is just weird. Fluorescent and awful. Two light switches by the door, one turns on the bathroom light AND the room lights, the other is the hall light. It took us 4 hours in the room before we finally discovered that we didn't need to walk over to the room door to turn on/shut the light off in the room. There is a hidden switch beside the bed. I say hidden because it is painted BLACK, the same color as the BLACK WALL! And it is about 18 inches off the floor so you can turn it on/off while laying in bed. Next, the wall between the bathroom and bed area is just a see-through screen. So if someone is in the bathroom with the light on you can see everything from the bed. The lighting by the bathroom sink is terrible. It was impossible to see to shave. The bathroom is beautiful and it was nice to have the toilet in its on room with a separate door, but there could be more countertop around the sink. If you want to use the internet wireless or wired it is $14.95 per day. Even in the lobby!! This is why I hate high-end hotels, once you are there they nickel and dime you to death. For nearly $400 a night can't they give you complimentary internet? The biggest issue at the W is the location. I don't care how convenient a hotel is if you can't get a good night's rest. We were woken up at 2am because there is a nightclub next door that emptied out into the street in front of the hotel. Drunk people screaming in the street and we must have heard at least 100 car horns. And we were on the 10th floor! It continued for a solid hour before we fell back to sleep. Then around 6:30-7am the door slamming starts. Between guests leaving their room and the housekeepers everyone lets their door go and their doors slam and rattles our entire room. This continued throughout the morning. This is one of the noisest hotels I've ever stayed in. I was happy to check out and would never consider staying here again. I told the rep at the check-out desk about the noise and she said it has been a problem. There are just too many other better choices in Boston, like the Ritz's or any in Back Bay with locations just as good. This hotel was still haunting me two days later as I received an email with my final bill and saw that nearly $30 in mini bar charges. We never touched anything in the mini bar (there's a 7 Eleven across the street which charges a 1/3 less). And they never mentioned there is a $46 charge per day for parking. Very excessive. I called to dispute the charges and they were removed all while the service rep told me this has been a problem! I wonder how many people just pay it and never know! And they never mentioned there is a $46 charge per day for parking.

I love Boston and have stayed there numerous times but I have ALWAYS wanted to stay at the W there. When booking the first thing you should be aware of is that though it is called the theatre district, and centrally located it is also right next door to a HOSPITAL! Which means that you will most likely be woken up by the sound of ambulances blazing on several nights during your stay. Weekened street traffic is VERY noisy, the windows are not sound proofed/double glazed b/c one can hear EVERYTHING going on down below. We were on the 11th floor, facing Stuart Street. When I asked the front desk about moving they said they would look after it but never got back to us despite our bags being packed and their best intentions. The staff at the front desk seems very accomodating and friendly w/ very little follow through! We were there for over a week, and I promise you I had less than two nights of good sleep despite numerous efforts and inquiries. The beds are comfortable, the room spacious and clean, though when I pulled the bathroom glass door closed there were smears and smudges on it from the previous occupants. Also, the bathroom in our room is configured with a false wall w/ art hanging over the opening, so if you are sharing, (if you are a light sleeper) one person cannot sleep while the other showers/dries hair etc b/c you do hear the noise. The conceirge was extremely helpful, they arranged the Acura service for our day out at Harvard and made other great suggestions. The room service and servers were lovely! The variety for dinner limited but good. The only meal that was a disappoointment was breakfast the day we were leaving. It was cold, and tastless. If you can get a room facing any other street I would assume the noise would not be an issue, and the hotel itself is stylish and modern, the amenities good, and the staff helpful for the most part. I would not stay again unless I was guaranteed a quiet room....a vacation is meant to allow you rest and relaxation.

This was my first visit to The W Boston and I was far far from disappointed as it lived up to the accolades my fellow Platinum friends that have stayed with you have shared with me. Perfect location on Stuart St, a beautiful sculptured glass sphere rising up against the back drop of the older buildings of the city. Truly breathtaking!

It solves the issue of seeing through to the bathroom from the bedroom area though it does not solve the issue of sound. I think the W Boston should seriously considering replacing the screen with an actual wall.

It was a great pick. In a busy city, this hotel is on a main street with very easy front door service / access. The valet parking was superb ($44 per night). We didn't even have the ignition turned off and they were right there opening the door and welcoming us. The concierge was quick to call a cab for us ($8 ride to Fenway), and there was always someone holding the front door for you. Check in and out was very quick and employees very friendly. The room we originally booked had been oversold so they asked us if we minded taking the exact same room only 40 square feet smaller. In return we would get 2 breakfast coupons (worth $20 a piece) and 2 drinks at their lounge. We are also offered a late (4 pm) check-out without asking. We had no problem with that. The decor, as mentioned in other reviews, is very modern, but comfortable. Our \"smaller\" room was actually very roomy, and we didn't miss the 40 square feet. The bed, pillows and sheets were so soft and comfortable. The \"infamous\" screen is actually pretty cool - assuming you are not rooming with anyone other than a significant other. During the day you can just see shadows moving around, but it is definitely see through at night with the lights on in the bathroom. I really did like it, but out of curiosity, and because of all the reviews about it, I did ask if this screen was in every room. They said yes. HOWEVER, a privacy screen is available for those who require it. I do agree the lighting in the bathroom is a little dim. But nothing tragic. The shower was very roomy, the water just the right temperature, and the pressure just right. The whole room was immaculately clean. There is a nice selection in the (typically expensive) mini bar. And, I loved the fact there were cell phone cords available for just about every type of phone. We did have breakfast at Market (the hotel's restaurant). The food was on the expensive side but very good and of very good quality. My only complaint is our waitress, although attentive, seemed like she would rather be anywhere but there. Understandable, who wants to be working, but don't let your customer's see that. The only reason this hotel did not get a overall rating of 5 was because, for me, it was too noisy. There is typical city street noise, but for some reason it seemed, at times, extra loud. This was particularly the case when a police car or ambulance went by. However, the big thing was the hallway noise. You could hear doors slamming and people talking as they walked up and down the hall. Luckily we were towards the end the hall so it wasn't so bad. I couldn't imagine being in a room outside of the elevators. I was also not overly thrilled with the fact that a gentleman came to check the mini bar at 3:30. If check in is 3 pm, I feel like that should have been taken care of by that time. Despite that, we would definitely come back to stay here again.

I booked it anyway, and all I can say is that we will never go anyplace else if we ever stay in Boston again. An easy drive to the intersection of Tremont and Stuart, we were greeted and directed immediately by the front door valet. When we checked in at the front counter, the young lady was overly friendly, very welcoming, and explained to us all the major ammenities the W offered us. And I loved this..you need to have access to a hotel key to use the elevator. I applauded the extra security as i found out later the lounge in the front of the hotel transforms into a late night bar where many non-guests have a drink at the bar. The rooms were beautiful. Clean,spacious, a long dresser counter, closet space, glass shower. Some negatives were very low output lighting, whats up with the alarm clock ??? (cant read the time), and the area around the toilet was a little cramped. Plenty of ample walk around room. One wierd \"decoration\" was the see thru screen between the bedroom and shower area. Now I enjoyed it, as I got to see my naked wife get out of the shower, but anyone traveling with kids may have to block this invisible wall with something. There was hookup available for WiFi, but we did not use. The king size bed was the most comfortable bed I had ever slept on. Too bad we needed to be up at 7:30. The location of the W is invaluable.

The room itself was large, but the \"soaking tub\" which we booked it for barely held one (petite) person.

While I found it a bit outrageous, my wife noted that she was paying $40/night to park at the Westin Copley at least as far back as in 2005 when she would stay there for business. So I guess it's just the cost of parking at an upper-level Boston hotel. Check-in was smooth, and they offered us 500 extra points if we didn't have our room made up each day. We accepted, but more on this later. Despite being told we had to use our key in the elevator to access our floor, we could go to any floor without using the key. Poor security or do they disable this procedure when the hotel isn't full of weekend bar-scene types who aren't guests? Having just stayed at the W in Austin (the one with the windows that fall out!), we appreciated the lighter and more airy decor. While the Austin W was dark and brooding, this one was the opposite. The room was perfectly sized for the two of us, plenty roomy. It may be small by standard hotel sizes, but it wasn't noticed by us. King (or was it a queen?) bed, bathroom with shower, A/C was blowing cool when we walked in. The light didn't work in the water closet, but it was fixed straightaway while we were out. Biggest complaint that I had was our 8th floor room faced Stuart street (main street, front of hotel) and I could hear the sirens and car alarms at night. They didn't bother my wife, so depending on your tolerance for nighttime noise, you may want to ask for a room away from the main street. We didn't experience bar- or restaurant-related noise on Sun or Mon nights. I was disappointed that the Acura valet service shuts down at 4 pm on weekdays. We wanted to use it to go to Cambridge, but could not. It runs later on weekends, and the friendly concierge said they are trying to get the service to extend weekday hours. Despite the 500 points for not making up our room agreement, our room was made up on Monday. Apparently the check-in staff didn't actually note it in our folio. Odd. We ended up still getting the points, but it's odd that they couldn't make this work properly. We did not eat at the hotel, rather had all meals out. We did have drinks one night at the bar. Mine were fine but my wife had a virgin bloody mary that was mere tomato juice. Upon complaining the bartender sampled it, apologized profusely, and whipped up a fresh (and spicy) one immediately. The Sweat gym is a nice facility that is far better than most hotel gyms. It was bigger than the W Atlanta Midtown, but tiny compared with the W Austin. Given our use of Starwood points to stay here I I can't really comment on $$ value. It was worth the points over staying at the Westin Copley (which we've stayed at before), IMHO.

Out of the hundreds of Marriotts, Starwoods, and Hiltons, this was the best greeting I have yet to experience. Very much different than the semi-robotic checkin seen at many big brand hotels. The check-in seemed to cater and be personalized to my needs. I was very impressed. As to the room, it was a W-size (smaller hotel rooms at all W's), but it was a suite. Two rooms, two bathrooms, excceptionally modern furniture, bar (stocked- both soda and liquor w/mixers), great sound system, double flat screens, and very modern but efficient work desk. The power outlets for my work computer were easy to access, and the desk chair was of reasonable comfort. (I have not been to many big-brand hotels that have comfortable work-desk chairs, so it was \"reasonable\" as compared to others). Most noticably, the floor-to-ceiling windows surrounds the living room, and the dining table, along with the exceptionally plush living room carpeting were a nice enhancement. The carpeting and unique \"flowing\" furniture in the living room was very modern, but stilll exceptionally comfortable and inviting. Some of the windows opened to let in fresh air- a welcome touch for a heavy business traveler. The hotel exercise room was standard W, not perfect, somewhat smaller than it should be, but efficient. Food, both room service and bar service were excellent. Prices of rooms at this property are higher than most competitors, but you are paying for the \"W\" experience.

As to bed quality, it was standard heavenly bed (from Westin) adapted to W standards. It was very comfortable and supportive. The bathroom was very large, and the towels were fluffy, soft and not-worn. Between the bed and towel quality, I was quite happy. Overall, this was an excellent W experience. I would stay here again.

We have them!\" So we waited 15 minutes for them to get 9our luggage, then went upstairs. The hallways were.... weird. There was a mural of a man with his head in bush, and it was like that like 10 times down the hallway- CREEPY. The rooms were very nice, and we were satisfied. After dinner however, that's when it went wrong. First of all, the lights in the room are connected to the same circuiting as the bathroom. When I went to go to the bathroom during the night, the lights didn't work, and I didn't know why so I just used my phone as a light. Next, my mom went to use the bathroom, and had the same problem. She discovered that the bathroom lights would only turn on if EVERY LIGHT INT HE ROOM was on. How is this a good idea? Everybody goes to the bathroom at night! It was miserable! Then, the air conditioning was poor too. It would turn on and become extremely cold. Then, it would turn off in 5 minutes, and become extremely hot. It did this all night. Awful. Overall, I didn't like the hotel. I got 2 hours of sleep and was miserable the next day.

It was somewhat of a last-minute change as my original plans were changed by my brother's recent move and a subsequently dirty house. Given this is a new hotel to Boston, I was keen to see how it was. First impressions: Staff are very friendly and personable. While checking us in, the agent was chatty, inquiring about where we were coming from and the reason for our trip and offered up any help that was needed. The lobby is not terribly spacious, yet makes nice use of stone to provide a cool yet classic look. In addition, the bar is located next to the check-in area and it doubles a happening nightspot at night, so there is plenty of comfortable seating. Room: If you like the most recent trends (that are somewhat yuppie), then the W is for you. The entry (foyer?) is dimly lit for mood. A dark carpet and muted walls don't do much to brighten this area up much either. Those with difficulty in dark spaces or deficient vision should take note. There is some cool art on the walls that leads you into the rest of the room. The washroom is absolutely huge, however I feel they could have provided a bit more space for the toilet. The door passes by literally less than 1 cm from the toilet, forcing you to stand rather awkwardly beside the toilet in order to close the door. Again, the lighting in the washroom could be improved slightly. Not that it's terrible, but if you're someone who appreciates light when getting yourself ready for a night on the town, maybe bring some kind of lantern. The last negative to the room is the amount of dead space. With a huge foyer and washroom, it felt like the area around the bed was tighter than it needed to be. This, however, could be because we were near the elevators, so not every room may necessarily be shaped like this (Note: If you do find yourself next to the elevators, see if you can be moved. While it wasn't terrible, there was a noticeable noise whenever the elevators were in motion). I will say, the bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in at a hotel. Furthermore, if possible, get a room facing the south. Not only do you get sun most of the day (to help combat the darkness), you also get a lovely view toward some of the more charming areas of the city. Given that the top half of the building is condos, those with a northerly exposure will, for the most part, just look across to the office building on the other side of Stuart St. Another advantage to the southerly exposure is that there are a lot of nightclubs in the vicinity. Stuart St. is arguably more traffic jammed at 2am on a Friday and Saturday night than at 5pm on a Wednesday, with a lot of people and cars. While the windows are remarkably well insulated, if you want to sleep with an open window, it could be a bit noisy. Amenities: Didn't use much of them. There is a full-service spa attached to the hotel. There is also a small fitness centre that has decent equipment. The 'business centre' is really just two iMacs (that run on Windows) at the end of the corridor on the ballroom level. Free internet is provided though there is a charge for printing. As mentioned, there is a bar on the ground level in the lobby that becomes quite happening at night. If you are a younger visitor, make sure you have a room key if coming back to the room at night. They appear to do ID checks at the door for people heading to the bar. A flash of the room key will ensure trouble-free access. There is also a restaurant with a menu created by Jean-Georges. I don't know who he is but he's done other restaurants for the W hotels. It appears to be good, though a bit pricey. Location: You can't beat the W's location. Located at Tremont and Stuart Sts., the W sits above the Theatre District. Perennial favourites like The Blue Man Group are just around the corner, as are the Wang and Shubert Theatres. The Opera House (home of The Nutcracker), Paramount and Modern Theatres (and their affiliated universities) are just a couple of blocks away near Downtown Crossing. The Boston Common and Public Gardens, as well as the shopping and dining strips of Boylston and Newbury Streets, and the charms of the Back Bay and South End are just a short walk away. Overall, a like a ultra-modern d\u00c3\u00a9cor is necessary, otherwise it can be a bit obnoxious. Furthermore, the brand the W creates for itself is a bit self-indulgent. But, if you don't mind that, or you have stayed at other Ws and you like the brand, then I suspect you'll be very happy with the W Boston. Given the W often tries to find unique properties (like their Union Square property in New York), the exterior of this building is a bit bland, but they've added nice touches to give it a different vibe.", "Date": "May 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, OR", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful and classy.

The rooms are modern and nice. The service however was terrible throughout our entire stay. It seems that job criteria for the staff are rather based on how people look than on their intelligence. I will only mention a few things: - I ordered two packages to the hotel. The first one was delivered to my room, but nobody knew where the second one was. It took several calls to the concierge until the package was finally found. - My mom left her pants in the room which we discovered when we had already returned to Europe. The first person said that they had not been found. A couple of e-mails later they had suddenly appeared. And were shipped to Germany. I told the hotel that they should ship them via regular postal mail as there was no hurry. However, the only shipping service they were using was Fedex, so it cost me approx. 90 USD to have the pants delivered to Switzerland. Probably it would have been to much of an effort to go to the USPS station instead of having the Fedex guy come right to the hotel. - Unfortunately, a colleague of ours who left earlier than we did also left a jacket in his room. As we were still at the hotel, we asked at the reception for it. This one wasn't found. We were \"offered\" the jacket of another guest instead, who apparently had left his jacket in the same room before our stay. - On our invoice there appeared a position of an additional approx. USD 1'500 - nobody could tell us what the charge was for. It wasn't until days after our stay and many e-mails back and forth that W transferred the money back to our accounts. We never learned what the charge was about. - The electronic keys did not work many times so we had to go down to the reception to have new ones issued. One time when we discovered that our key was not working, a friendly W staff member came up to us and told us that he'd run down for us to get us a new key while we could wait in front of our room. The person never returned. All in all, people did not seem to have any problem solving ability. I have a feeling, W Boston staff members are \"trained\" for certain processes - and as soon as something goes wrong don't know what to do. Problems are transferred to other staff members instead of looking for a solution themselves. I have no idea what W means claiming \"whenever wherever service\" in its advertising.

The Wow Suites are in corner rooms, so there are windows to the city on two complete sides, but with room-darkening curtains that do a great job of giving privacy when needed. Other than that, open them up and enjoy the view of the city at night. The decor is modern, trendy and comfortable. On the living room side, there is seating for 6-7 people, a beautiful wet bar, a large flat-screen TV and a smashing Bang & Olufsen stereo system -- bring your CDs and invite a few friends up! There's a small dining table graced with orchids, and a plush, soft shag-style rug underfoot. Super comfy, fun, and showy. On the bedroom side, there's a lovely king bed with deluxe bedding, a well-appointed desk with internet access and anything you need to get some work done. A curved couch with soft pillows sits in front of the windows. There's a second large flat-screen TV in there. Bed was super comfortable and the room was very quiet - had a great night's sleep. Great task lighting on the bed (reading lamps attached to the headboard on either side) was a big plus. The bathroom is very big, great jacuzzi tub, and a marble stall shower. I really appreciated the lighted magnifying makeup mirror. There's a second bathroom over on the living room side -- this, plus the ability to completely close off the bedroom from the living room really make this space suitable for entertaining - especially if there are two of you, and one has company while the other wants to get some rest. This is a very \"hip\" hotel and while the staff is younger, they still give great, attentive service. Complimentary coffee is offered in the lobby in the morning but I'm a tea drinker so they fixed me tea upon request. Concierge Jennifer was delightful and very helpful. This hotel is smack dab in the middle of the theater district. We had theater tickets and it was a very quick walk to the theater from the hotel. The Wang and the Shubert were within sight of the room - this is a great place to stay when you're seeing a show. Breakfast the next day was hearty and delicious.

True to form they did wow us! Because we were celebrating our anniversary, I contacted the hotel directly prior to arrival to make a room request and advise them of the special occasion. Upon arrival in our room we were greeted with champagne and chocolate-dipped strawberries (at no charge). While the room requested and promised was not available the first night they upgraded us to a beautiful, corner suite for the rest of our stay. Additionally, they \"comped\" us a free breakfast and some drinks at the bar as a gesture for the initial let-down. The rooms are nicely appointed in a modernistic style. The front desk staff is very friendly and takes a genuine interest in answering your questions and providing directions to various sites. The hotel is centrally located in the Tremont section near several theaters and within walking distance of Chinatown, Boston Commons (park), Cheers Bar (from TV series) and Newbury Street (upscale shopping district). Moreover, it is within easy walking distance (7 mins.) of the Subway system (Bolyston Station) which proffers economical access to the entire transportation network of Boston. Getting to/from the airport by subway/train is easy involving one change (at Gov't Center) and takes about 30 mins. if no delay. We highly recommend this hotel because of its commitment to customer service, great rooms and central location. Small issues for some may be that the outside street noise can be heard within some rooms - particularly if there is a lot of traffic or noisy crowds outside (which may occur on Friday and Saturday nights). Also, light sleepers may be bothered by the low-level, ambient hum from the HVAC vent/ductwork that may exist in select rooms.

I grew up in the Boston area and when I return from NYC for visits I often take the least expensive hotel I can find. Having not lived there for 5+ years I was surprised to see that the W was built near the theatre district. This was not the best area growing up but has really made huge changes. The check in was thorough and quick both times and the staff super-friendly. The W is known to be a bit of a scene so check-in happens amidst the hotel lobby bar which is always packed. The rooms are really nice. We stayed in a King and a 2DBL. The showers are not behind a closed door so be aware if you are traveling with friends and want privacy. The usual W products from bliss are always a treat. The linens were lovely. Our room had a huge window but tons of drapes if you wanted it more dark. Room service is oferred until very late at night. The W has an Acura car svc that has somewhat random hours but they will take you within 3 miles for free. Otherwise cabs are easy to come by. This is a great location to get to the South End, Back Bay or downtown. TIP: If you are bringing a car avoid the W valet ($40/day) and park across the street in the Transportation Building garage for half the price. We felt very safe here. The staff was super-attentive.

My room was on the 14th floor and faced the transportation building. Noise was only a problem in the morning with honking cars and few ambulances (thanks to the Tufts Medical Center ER being a few blocks away). The windows could be tighter, but it wasn't a serious issue. The layout of the room was very nice with moderately comfortable lounge chairs, great sweetsleeper bed, and great bathroom. The issues about the toilet not having windows or exhaust are real and should be addressed. I was alone so the screen between the sink and the bedroom wasn't an issue, but it wasn't 100% transparent, so unless you are staring at the screen you wouldn't have too much to write home about. The one thing that bugged me about the bathroom was the lighting and mirror. I have bad vision and don't shave with my glasses on, so not having a bright light and a mirror about two feet away made shaving a bit challenging. They do have a small mirror with a light, but it's on the counter, forcing me to bed over and down to look into, a bit awkward. Also, it would be great if they would at least have a water boiler for even instant coffee, but nothing is available. Room service coffee is $13 and if you don't mind throwing on some clothes, Starbucks is across the street for $2 coffee. Overall, I loved the experience and would like to ask that they cease and desist with the messages from the front desk explaining the lighting system or other items.

Overall, the rooms were nice and comfortable. However, the service was mediocre. The service definitely did not meet up to the standards of a W hotel and I would not recommend this hotel for someone staying in Boston. Rooms/Cleanliness The rooms were very comfortable with a modern, slightly minimalist style. However, they are a bit on the small side. The pillows, sheets, covers, and bed were extremely comfortable and what you would expect from a W hotel. The view was okay, overlooking the downtown Boston area. The entire hotel, including the rooms and hallways, had a nice fragrance due to the Alora Ambiance diffusers they used. However, upon checking in to our room, we noticed that the waste basket was full of dirty tissues. We called housekeeping and while they came within a few minutes, we were not impressed with this oversight in cleaning. Location The location is pretty decent. It's close to the Tremont green-line stop. It's a few minutes away walking from the Boston Commons. It's really close to Chinatown, if you're looking for Chinese food. However, the hotel isn't in the nicest of neighborhoods. While the area is clean and safe, it's not exactly the most aesthetically pleasing location. Service This is the one area where I really had a problem. I know the hotel is fairly new, but the service simply was not what I had expected from a W hotel. Right from the beginning, I knew something was wrong. The hotel has two sets of big glass doors, and when we approached, the doorman did not open the doors for us. In fact, throughout our stay, almost always, a doorman either was not present or did not open the doors for us. Even during the snowstorm, no one opened the doors and we had to pry open both doors. The staff at the front desk were a bit cold. No warm greeting, no welcome- just straight to business and giving us the room cards. The man at the front desk didn't explain any of the amenities or attractions of the hotel. He simply handed us the cards. More importantly, he asked us if we wanted parking. We told him that we didn't need parking. During check-out, he charged us for parking! We told him that we confirmed with him during check-in that we didn't get parking and also told him that we didn't even have a car. For his mistake, he made us wait 10 minutes while he went somewhere and checked. Finally, when I went home, the hotel charged me for a bag of nuts that I never touched. They refunded the money, but all of these little instances left a bad taste in my mouth. Ultimately, the smooth, \"whatever whenever\" service of the W hotels simply was not present at the W Hotel Boston. While certainly none of what I said would really amount to serious bad service, I would still rather spend my money on another 4-star hotel with better, warmer, competent service.", "Date": "October 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "franklin", "Title": "\u201cBest cultural...historical and delicious city in the US!\u201d", "Author": "jppadgett", "ReviewID": "UR82658072", "Content": "Fantastic fast and furious weekend with too many options to choose from> Love the Onyx hotel just a short walk from little Italy and the historic district Faneul Hall etc. Very friendly staff.

There were two switches on the wall, one that turned on every light in the room and another that did nothing. You need to turn on all the overhead lights in the room in order to turn on the bathroom lights. This is probably because of the \"peeper\" art on the wall between the bathroom and bedroom.

I was suprised the W picked this location, but I suppose the area is \"up and coming\" so maybe it won't be like this for much longer. Room was fairly cleaned, but found plastic bags from previous guest and a wash cloth in between the wall and dresser. Both those things were there the entire visit, along with the iron board and iron that I had used Friday night.

Bouncer-like concierge guarding the hotel at night is annoying. I'm not sure why people stand on line to hang out at the hotel lobby bar, I don't see it as being such a hip/swanky place, but maybe it is for Boston.

Probably not the attire to wear to the W Boston lounge apparently, but for my purposes that evening it suited me just fine. I waited to the right of the main entrance, about 5-10 feet away, while waiting for a friend to meet me, and the bouncer stationed at the door kept looking at me while I waited with a condescending look on his face. Finally after a few minutes, the bouncer called over to me, and with a cold and demeaning attitude asked me: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Can I help you? Are you looking for something?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As if my presence to the right of the main entrance, was causing an issue for the W\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s image and I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worthy to be standing near the hotel. I honestly was caught off guard, and after a minute I responded by reminding the bouncer that I was a guest. Regardless if I was a guest or not, the W (Starwood) management should certainly offer better sensitivity training to their staff, including bouncers/security stationed at the door. W Boston should also evaluate if having the main entrance to the hotel roped off in the evening to serve both as the lounge entrance and entrance for hotel guests to enter the hotel is the most ideal situation. The experience left a bad impression for what otherwise was a great stay at what I know to be a fabulous hotel brand and wonderful room. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll return, but will definitely keep my eye out for the overly zealous bouncers at the door, and kindly remind them of their manners.", "Date": "August 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cUnique Hotel with Excellent Service\u201d", "Author": "mrg0137", "ReviewID": "UR74452747", "Content": "I recently stayed at the W Boston with my family for two nights during a sightseeing trip to Boston. It was our first time staying at a W, and without a doubt, it was a unique experience, one that both impressed and surprised us. Although it is repeatedly mentioned in reviews of the W, anyone thinking of staying here should be aware that it is a trendy hotel. Everything is modern and edgy, and the rooms, while lovely, have a couple of features that are simply uncomfortable for many people. The goal of the W is to be hip, young, trendy, etc. My twenty-year-old son enthusiastically loved everything about the hotel. It seems to be marketed to 20-somethings with money to burn on an expensive hotel room. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay here, and it is one of the nicer places I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever stayed. The level of service provided is top notch, and truly differentiates it. Some things were a little odd, but the good heavily outweighs the bad. The location of the W is good, within two blocks of Boston Common and the Public Gardens, as well as in the heart of the small Boston theatre district. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the most beautiful neighborhood in Boston, but it is fine, perfectly safe, and the W itself definitely improves the local area. There aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a ton of full-service restaurants or shopping within walking distance of the hotel, but there are a few, and there is a Starbucks and Dunkin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Donuts across the street from the hotel, as well as some sort of food court in the transportation building across the street. Finding a normal sit-down restaurant is a slight challenge around here, but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find it to be a problem, or mind walking a few blocks, since Boston is such an easy walking city. The hotel itself is a new, modern high-rise, but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to be up at the top. The hotel occupies the first 15 floors, with the rest being the W Residences. We arrived very early for check-in, around 8:00 am, and were welcomed very nicely by the valet staff. (Valet parking is $44 per night). Every time we entered or exited the hotel for anything, we always found there to be at least a few people ready and waiting to open the doors for us, welcome us to the hotel, etc. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think anyone in my family ever opened the front door of the hotel themselves. There was always someone there to do it for us. The hotel lobby is very nice, with lots of seating areas, all with modern furniture and decorated in tones of blue and gray. There were large walls of windows in the lobby overlooking the street in front of the hotel, which made it very pleasant during the day. At night, the lobby, which has a bar as its centerpiece, becomes more like a nightclub than a hotel lobby. There is loud music playing, people of various ages all over the place, and a general lack of the calm and serenity that you can experience during the day! We felt a little uncomfortable walking back into the hotel at night, and would quickly run over to the elevators to retreat to our room. For some people, the lively bar scene would be appreciated, but for a family, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so desirable. As we expected, there weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any rooms available to check into so early when we arrived, but the front desk staff was very courteous and welcoming anyway. She saw that one room had recently been vacated of the type we had reserved, and offered to put a rush on it for cleaning. She also immediately offered to take our luggage to hold until the room was ready, and took our cell phone number to call when the room was ready. We never actually received a call during the day letting us know that the room was ready, but it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter to us since we were busy touring all day, and had really only wanted to drop off our luggage and car in the first place. There was always a bowl of apples available at the front desk, as well as complimentary fruit-infused water or coffee depending on the time of day. When we checked in later and went up to our room, we were a bit confused, as you have to insert your room key in the elevator to get to any room floor. It won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go anywhere if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. The room that we had (1401) was designated a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mega Room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which corresponds to an upgrade from the standard \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Wonderful Room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The mega room was supposed to be a larger corner room, and it definitely was. The room was huge, especially for a city! It had lots of open space, both in the entrance to the room, as well as by the beds. It felt like an upscale loft apartment. There were walls of windows on two sides of the room, which overlooked the local area. The view from the hotel isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t overly remarkable, just average areas of the city, but it was so nice to have so many windows to keep the room light and bright. It was also nice at night to stay in the room with the windows open overlooking the lights of the city. The room d\u00c3\u00a9cor is very modern, in tones of white, dark blue, gray, and black. Our room had 2 queen beds, which were very comfortable, with white duvets, featherbeds, and plush pillows. There was a desk with a comfortable chair, and one chair with an ottoman. One thing I would recommend is that the hotel put more furniture in the larger rooms like ours. Our room, although quite a bit larger than the average room, didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really seem to have any extra furniture. It left the room looking a bit bare in some parts. However, the mega room was well-worth the upgrade for the corner location, space, and windows. There are lots of nice features in the rooms, which especially appeal to a younger crowd, such as an iPod dock and 14 or 16 cell phone chargers (one for each type of cell phone). There was a flat screen HDTV, along with a DVD player. All of the features in the room were well thought out and useful. However, everything couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be perfectly normal, in typical W style! The issue that we had came with the bathroom. The bathroom fixtures themselves were lovely. The bathroom was large, with nice marble floors, a beautiful tub/shower, and sink area with upgraded Bliss Spa toiletries that we loved. The toilet is in its own room within the bathroom. However, as seems to be common with W Hotels, there was a lack of privacy in the bathroom. The wall between the bathroom and the bedroom has a large hole cut out of it, with a piece of artwork on a screen hung over it. On the bedroom side of the screen, there is a picture of some trees, and on the bathroom side, the sink mirror hangs in front of part of the screen, with a Thoreau poem written on the rest. At first glance, this seemed different, and somewhat interesting, to have a screen between the bedroom and bathroom, rather than a full wall. However, when the lights are turned on in the bathroom at all, it becomes see-through, so that everyone in the room can see right into the bathroom and vice versa. I just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really see the point of having a see-through screen between the bedroom and bathroom, especially to see in from the bedroom to the bathroom. It ended up giving a lack of privacy, which some of our family found uncomfortable. It was a shame because it detracted from an otherwise beautiful bathroom. I believe that internet in the room was $15 in the room, but there is free internet available in the lobby/bar area. You can connect to the wireless down there for free for an hour at a time, and I realized that it would still work in our room after making the initial connection downstairs. I saw a lot of people clustered in the lobby area by the elevators trying to use the internet, but it was nice to be able to connect for free, and then take my laptop back up to the room for the rest of the hour and continue to use it for free. For some people, having to do that wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be worth it, but I thought it was worth it to avoid paying. A lot of the little things at the W are definitely unconventional as well, such as wallpaper on the ceiling in the elevator waiting areas that is a collage of pictures of eyes, which appear to be looking at you from above as you wait. In the hallways, there are pictures on the walls of men looking through hedges, effectively looking like they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re peeking into the rooms. We generally found these touches to be fun and different, but for the very traditional person, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be uncomfortable, just as we found the bathroom set-up uncomfortable. Staying at the W is all about your personal comfort level, and what you find acceptable. The designers of the hotel push the envelope with everything, in an appeal to a younger crowd. Despite the odd eccentricities of this hotel, the little touches definitely did make it special. These include things like the doormen always available to open the doors and welcome us to the hotel, as well as the carpets in the lobby and elevators that are changed throughout the day to read \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Good Morning\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Good Afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Good Evening\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Pillows on the beds in the room are changed by the maids to read either \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Welcome\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sweet Dreams\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd depending on the time of day. Service is also excellent. We asked the maid for a few extra bath products to take home, since we love the Bliss items, and she left tons of everything for us on the last day. We were expecting just a couple extra bottles of shampoo maybe, but she left lots of everything for us. A true testament to service at the W came at check-out. We were out in the morning on our last day, and on our way back in before check-out, we stopped to ask the valet to get the car, while we went up to our room to get our things. We figured that would give plenty of time to have our car waiting when we got down. When we came back downstairs and checked out about half an hour later, the car still hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been brought up. We waited and waited, and still nothing. We were getting annoyed, but without saying anything, an employee (not sure if he was a manager or not) came over and noticed that we had been standing with our luggage for a while. He asked if we needed anything at all, and when we mentioned that we had been waiting for our car for a long time, he took action immediately. He reprimanded the valet staff, and the car was up within a minute or two. He apologized multiple times, as did other staff who weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even involved, like those at the front desk, and he had the parking charge for the day removed from our bill immediately. Although the long wait for parking wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ideal, the way that the situation was handled was amazing. Without asking for anything, the staff realized a mistake had been made, took action, and helped us as best they could as quickly as possible. Even though we left after having waited an hour for our car to be brought up, we left happy with the service at the W. At the end of the day, the W is really a beautiful hotel. It is new, fresh, and upscale. The room we had was beautiful and immaculate at all times, and the staff is some of the best we have ever encountered at a hotel for its attentiveness and level of service. I found the hotel to be a little too hip for what I wanted, and it clearly appeals strongly to a younger crowd. I would consider staying at a W again, but I would want to find one with a more private bathroom. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re usually Westin fans, and the W offers everything Westin does in terms of great beds, calming rooms, etc., but with a twist. The service was better at the W, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a toss-up for which chain we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d choose in the future. Just be aware that the W is going to be different from your average hotel, both in ways you may want, like great service, and in some ways you may not want, like a nightclub-esque lobby and lack of privacy.", "Date": "August 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cVery comfortable and stylish hotel - HIGHLY recommended!\u201d", "Author": "Parsely115", "ReviewID": "UR74280950", "Content": "After our first stay at the W Boston, enough great things can't be said!

The W Boston is on the edge of the Back Bay area and is only a couple of blocks from Boston Common, which was convenient as we wanted to walk the Freedom Trail, which includes Boston Common as well as other historical sights close to the hotel. This was our first stay at a W hotel and were quite pleased with our hotel experience - check-in was fast and efficient, and the concierge quickly confirmed a massage appointment that evening. In order to accomodate the in-room massage request, we were given a very large corner room on the top floor (although I should also state that I'm a Starwood Preferred Gold member, so my membership may have also helped snag the room upgrade). Unlike some other reviewers, we didn't find the room configuration too unusual - we resolved the less than optimal lighting in the bathroom and my girlfriend's back problem by moving a light fixture and the ottoman next to the sink. Also, we didn't find the staff too hip for us or encounter any attitude - on the contrary, everyone (from the doorman, to the check-in staff, the bellhop, the concierge, the room service staff, and the hotel's Acura driver) were very professional, helpful, and friendly. Of course, being reasonably dressed and groomed, being polite, smiling, saying thank you, and providing appropriate tips always helps. We ordered room service for dinner and breakfast and while it was pricey, we really enjoyed the Jean-Georges Vongerichten menu - especially the fact that the W Boston accomodated all of my girlfriend's gluten-free diet needs, including a request for almond milk for her hot chocolate at breakfast. The services that the W Boston offers that we really enjoyed were 1) the flexibility to accomodate gluten-free menu requests, 2) the one-way ride in an Acura within a few miles of the hotel, 3) free wi-fi in the lobby, and 4) late check-out (4PM, as we had a late flight back to San Francisco). We also liked that there was a gym (which unfortunately we did not use due to our busy schedule). The Acura service would have been perfect if the W Boston offered round-trips and not just one-way trips, and it would have been nice if the free wi-fi was also offered in the room, but all in all our stay was an outstanding value, and we will definitely consider staying at the W Boston again next year.", "Date": "July 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cStylish but well suited for business travel\u201d", "Author": "traveler60601", "ReviewID": "UR70623733", "Content": "Very similar to most W Hotels, a brand that admittedly can be a little over the top sometimes with the \"hip\" atmosphere they try to cultivate, but I found a very agreable balance here.

Not only was the bar a hot-spot every night, from Monday through Sunday, where some of the nicest people in town would show up (and show-off) and the restaurant be a truly delightful gourmet experience, but you are also constantly reinforced rock-star status from the moment you check-in to the moment when you open your room door and see the \"wow\". Of course, the W is not for everyone, as neither is the Ritz Carlton or the Peninsula. The W is trendy, chic and, above all, sexy. It is a musical hotel, with all planned to a fantastic stay. The hotel's gym is nice, but could have been larger and better equipped. The rooms were amongst the roomiest that I have tried at any W in the world. The only drawbacks of this W are its location and lack of view. With so many hotels with water views in Boston, the W really lacks a sexy view to complement its style. It is not sexy to look into an old dusty office building. Also, it is not sexy to walk into abandoned streets in the outskirts of China town. I hope that the presence of the W starts to bring better tenants into the neighborhood. The W is a 5 minutes walk to the Boston Commons and 10 minutes to the financial district. 15 minutes to Atlantic avenue and 20 minutes to Columbus park. Not the best location for sure, however, if you rent a bicycle (which you should) the Whatever Whenever staff will store it for you overnight, no problem, and you will be able to get anywhere in just 3 to 7 minutes.

I was attending meetings there, otherwise I would not have chosen this hotel. I spend a lot of time in hotels and this was my first stay at a \"W\". There were a couple of hiccups at check-in, but nothing too serious. The rooms are spacious and the bed was comfortable. The chairs in the room however, were not. I don't know who thought that corner chairs with no backs would be a good choice for relaxing in a hotel room. They were incredibly uncomfortable and the only other option was the desk chair or sitting on the bed. Neither of which was particularly appealing for watching television. Speaking of television, I was surprised that the lovely flat screen TV mounted on the wall had no ability to turn or swivel, even a couple of inches. The television faces the bed, period. Don't plan on being able to really view it well from the uncomfortable chairs. While I applaud the attempt to be \"green\" by choosing energy efficient lighting, I found myself struggling to see in the bathroom mirror. The lighting was only on one side of the sink and was ineffectual at best. Add to that the fact that the mirror was at the back of a rather deep counter and any man wanting a shave or any woman wanting to apply mascara would have a pretty difficult time seeing in order to do so. (I overheard some others in my group voicing this very same complaint.) While I would probably not stay at a \"W\" again, as I mentioned in the beginning, it really is about personal preference in hotel style and comfort.

What was even MORE impressive was the service, however. The W hotels have the reputation for making every wish come true, \"so long as it's legal.\" This is so true! If they don't have what you want on the menu, they get it from another place. If you wish to have a Dt. Mountain Dew, or Starbucks, or whatever, on your doorstep at a specific time, it is there. Whatever you wish. And what I found was, in some cases, at no extra charge. Surprise! And they have a guest database which keeps track of your wishes, so if I were to stay with them again, my Dt. Mt. Dew would simply arrive at 7am. Wow! There is a HUGE amount of attention to detail from the staff, from switching out welcome floor mats in elevators according to the time of day, to having a PERSONAL wake up call (remember those days?) with a cheery voice reminding you to take your umbrella with you if it's a rainy day.

Upon returning we expected the inclusions to be in the room and they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. We were a bit disappointed because of the price we paid but once again no big deal. We called the front desk and this time they took care of it right away- which to me is what counts because mistakes do happen (especially in a place as large as this hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.. and its huge!) Other than that everything was perfect! The staff was friendly and very helpful as well as efficient at check in and check out. The valet guys and doormen were friendly with great personalities and we talked to them a few times while we were there. The room was huge with a nice comfy king bed and flat screen TV and shower that was all glass ( I think they called it a peak-a-boo shower or something). The room as well as the hotel, elevators and lobby were spotless. We ordered room service one morning and it was expensive but good and arrived quick. As far as it being loud like other people said, its wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t or at least not where I was and my room was located on one of the lower floors and facing the Rock Bottom restaurant and was sort of right above the lobby area and I slept like a baby when we finally arrived back at the hotel.

After 4 hours on the road from NYC I was ready to sit on the bed and watch TV. When asked, the front desk couldn't tell us when the room would be ready so we went to the bar for a drink that we had to pay for, no credit for the room not being ready at 3:30 at check-in time. After about 40 minutes I had to go back to the front desk to find the room was ready and she had forgotten to come get us. It was Valentines weekend and everyone seemed very flustered.

Having been to W hotels in NY and Hong Kong, I've come to fully understand what makes these hotels unique. This was the only reason why we chose to try out the new W Boston for our stay in Boston. My level of expectation was where it should've been - outstanding service, outstanding attention to detail, outstanding decor and outstanding amenities. As soon as we checked into our room, I was left ill-satisfied on all accounts. I will start off by saying that if comparing the W Boston to other hotel chains like the Sheraton or Hilton, it was a decent hotel. The room itself was very spacious. But I would've traded a smaller space for all the unique qualities that make it worthy of being called a W. If you have stayed at other W Hotels before, the W Boston WILL be a major disappointment. Here is a list of the things that were subpar to a real W's standards: The people that manned the front desk were just simply doing their jobs. They looked up your info, gave you your room key, and that's about it. Didn't crack a smile, didn't want to seem too friendly. The W Hotel's mantra is \"Whatever, Whenever\". I don't think the front desk got the memo. As soon as we get to our room, my mind started buzzing around noticing all the little things that was missing in the so-called W room. Where were the automatic light buttons by the bedside? (you had to literally get up from bed all the way to the front door to shut the lights off. Boo.) Where were the cool modern gadgets? Where were the cool home furnishings? The decor in this room was very 'corporate' and 'business-man' like, which is FINE if we were staying at a Sheraton. And there was a very strange wall hanging of a haunted forest next to the bed and a weird poem about ravens and birds printed on the inside bathroom wall. Definitely not romantic, and definitely not cool. There were no slippers in the room and no toothbrush kits in the bathroom, so we had to call the front desk for those. They ran those up to our room in lightning speed, but they were supposed to already be in the room! There was something \"off\" about the down comforter. My husband and I plopped down on the bed after a 6 hour bus ride, and i noticed thousands of tiny little feathers dancing in the air. And everytime we moved the comforter the slightest bit, (even just getting in and out of bed), the air would be filled with tiny feathers. I know that this is not a problem with high quality comforters, since they finished the seams with double and triple reinforcements. I saw the feathers on everything - the black nightstand, our water glasses, our clothes.... We took one look at the room service menu and we knew we would never be ordering food to our room during the stay. If you are on a corporate expense account, knock yourself out. But $28 for 2 eggs and potatoes? No thank you. Also, the Bliss Spa was not opened yet. Major bummer. There should've been a notice about that on the starwood website, but there wasn't. The gym was pretty small but not too many people were there during the hours we were working out, so we had the run of the place. It would've been nice if the gym were on a higher floor so we aren't looking out to a red brick building while we're working out. It's small things like this that make a hotel feel special. Another lost point here. There is free wifi in the Lounge, so we would go there with our laptops in the morning. I was pretty surprised that they didn't have any food/drink service in the morning. They didn't open until noon. So where are we supposed to get our coffee from? The $9 drip coffee from room service? I would've been annoyed if I were on a business trip. But we were not, so we went across the street to Starbucks every morning. The lounge gets packed at night and is very lively. Our key card kept getting deactivated for some reason, and every time we went to the front desk to get it fixed, it was the same woman asking us the same questions. Either she didn't recognize us each time, or she was being an unaccommodating pain. I don't know which is worse. And never offered an apology for our inconvenience. Seriously? Doormen - there were about 4-5 of them standing around the door at all times. But how is it that more than half the time we came in and out of the hotel, we opened those heavy doors by ourselves. More than half! The one really good thing about the W Boston was the location. We found it convenient to everything. Also, the Rock Bottom Bar across the street had a great selection of beers and delicious food. Highly recommended. Next time in Boston, we will stay at the Nine Zero hotel.

It didn't feel like the designers worked well together to synthesize everything. The space in the room felt confused and maze-like. The quality of the furnishing felt like one step up from Ikea. Entering the hotel was awkward because it is in the middle of the block across from one of the worst lower-level mall/office buildings in the city. With that said, the staff was nice, and I have had worse service at nicer hotels. The room service was nice; the food arrived hot with a friendly attendant. Apart from the noise, the only unsettling part of the overall experience was getting a room that someone before me had obviously come in, sat down, and decided it wasn't right for him. The indentations in the bed and a baggage claim check were proof thereof. I'm not so picky as to request that the room be made up again, but you would at least expect them to check a room that someone else has entered and refused.

Uncomfortably squashed next to Chinatown, opposite the Rock Bottom Tavern and the seedier streets that lead into South End. The architecture is bland to the extent of looking like the headquarters of a medium size cement distributer. The ground floor is dominated by a lively bar but for hotel guests, we have to squash into an oddly shaped space to wait endlessly while the \"Talent\" as Ws designate their employees, plod slowly, hitting keys with thick fingers until you are just desperate for any rooms. The normally chic model wannabes have been replaced by pudgy short men who look like mafiosi planted to work as hotel staff. The rooms themselves are large and uninspiring. Gone is the individualism and attempt at international luxe that characterizes more glamorous W locations- replaced by unusable plastic corner seats, sparse furnishing and annoyingly small closet space given the square footage. The same applies to bathroom where the sink and loo are cramped, tip-toeing around a vast useless empty floor. Lighting is abysmal- covering fluorescent light tubes by plexiglass may be cool in a high school plastic arts projects, but in a room dominated by mixed woods and pale sheets, they just look cheap and unflattering, Reading lights appear to be miniature klieglights designed by elves. Service is atrocious- toileteries and water not replaced, dirty towels slung back over chairs, cushions left as they are found and the bed made in the most perfunctory way. Essentially a 30 second wander through by housekeeping- I mean cleaning \"Talent\"- to engaged in their black outfits to really make up a room. Front of house \"Talent\" blend seemlessly with the tide of unwashed slovenly humanity piling out of the mass dining establishments that surround the hotel and any sense of ownership or leadership seems utterly lacking. The styling of the rooms and common areas are so generic that they can't make up for the hotel views of not quite the common, not quite the east, not quite the river- rather the late 20th century monstrosities that surround the W Boston. And in this singular lack of charm, style or service- one would have though free WiFi might have been a good selling point.

The rooms in the W Boston are spacious albeit a little bit 'grey'.

I've stayed at other Ws (NYC and Chicago) and the modern, trendy vibe isn't my style, but I wanted to try out this location because the hotel is brand new and the location was in closest proximity to my reason for being in Boston. The best thing about this W, in my opinion, is its gym, which blows all the other hotel gyms in the city out of the water (except for hotel gyms that also sell memberships to the public, like the Ritz's and the gym at the Boston Harbor Hotel). It's h-u-g-e, with all the equipment you could possibly want, but NOT crammed so full of machines that you can't move without tripping over something. Lots of room for mat exercises, good mirrors, plenty of yoga blocks and straps, Bosu balls, even boxing bags and gloves. There are big windows overlooking the front entrance of the hotel and the treadmills are the kind with integrated TV screens at waist height, so if you don't want to watch while you run, you can look out the window without having a screen looming in front of you. There are also comfy upholstered banquettes for resting on, water, fruit and Bliss face wipes. Plus they keep the temperature quite cool, so you can sweat longer. Really, I can't say enough good stuff about it compared to the standard hotel gym (ahem, incredibly disappointing gym at the Liberty Hotel). The service, from doorman, through check-in, to concierge and check out was impeccable. Now the negatives. The worst thing about the hotel is the noise at night. Granted, my stay was on a Saturday, but I was on the 10th floor and specifically requested a quiet room and I was still woken up 2 or 3 times by sirens/honking. I felt like I was in Manhattan, not Boston, where street noise is not something that you need to worry about at most hotels. Maybe the rooms with windows on the rear of the building are quieter? Also annoying is the additional $15/day charge to use the Internet from your hotel room. Why? Given how young, hip, and technologically slick they try to be (see: in-room W Hotels CD of electronica), I'm going to bet that everyone who stays there considers Internet access to be about as basic as running water. So charging for it feels like a gouge. How much can it possibly cost the hotel to provide? Why not build it into the room rate? My annoyance was somewhat mitigated by the free Sunday New York Times ($6). Totally unexpected and very much appreciated. As mentioned, I'm not a fan of the type of furniture they have (flimsy and IKEA-ish) and while I know Bliss Spa is a nice, quality name, the fragrances of the bath products were a bit off-putting. They, like much about the decor and many of the amenities, seem keyed to appeal to men more than women. No bathtubs (at least in my room), if you like to soak. Would I stay there again?
