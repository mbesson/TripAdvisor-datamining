Upon pulling up you can park right in front and get valet service for roughly $45 bucks, or you can pull into a garage across the street, in retrospect, we would have just used a garage but it was very convenint to just pull up and let the staff take care of everything. The staff were very hospitable, and we were introduced to all individually and provided a warm initial impression. They were very accomodating and welcoming. We were taken to our room and shown around it, we had the loft category room. We were impressed by the modern decor and the great bedroom and living room separated by a small dividor in the middle of the room which has HD Tv's on both sides (one for bedroom/one for living room area). Bathroom was large and had everything you needed, shower was great, high power great body washes, etc. The bathroom was a huge window however, where you can be in the bed and look directly into it. Not a big deal for us, thought it was clever, but there is a curtain you can draw for a little more privacy.Noise a tnight was present, but you have ear plugs provided if you need them. Great space and perfect for a place to crash and relax in between going around Boston. We visited the hotel bar the Woodward for a few drinks before hitting the town, great sleection, very friendly staff, it was very crowded at 6:30-7 so if you plan on goign for happy hour, you have been warned. We were lucky to have to hostess find us a table to jus thave drinks at for a while and satified our needs. We also had breakfast here and it was pleasant, we received a voucher through our booking agency so it was fre, but given the quality, believe we would gladly pay next tiem around. You will not need a car here as it is within walking distance to everywhere despite how intimidating the walk appears on Google maps. Quincy Market/Faneuil Hall all 2 minutes from front door of Ames.

My friend mentioned that the bar/restaurant downstairs was excellent, and I saw a great crowd of people there at a weekend. Stepping out of a lift you see a carpeted, rather sophisticated hallway with a high ceiling. The atmosphere quickly reminds you that this is a boutique hotel in the sense that everything is dark and is reminiscent of nightclubs. When you open the door to your room, however, what you see is not a typical carpeted hotel room. In truth I felt like as though I was walking into someone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apartment. The room I stayed in is furnished with elegant, minimalistic furniture and has a light hardwood floor and huge windows. The ceiling is quite high, as is the case with the hallway, and the view from my 8th floor corner room is not fantastic, but perhaps better than the most hotel rooms. The high ceiling and oversized windows certainly give the room a sense of openness. Below are some observations I would like to share with you: - As you can see from my photos of the room, there is no bathtub, despite the large-size bathroom. It seems most rooms are only quipped with showers, some of which are considerate of guests with disabilities and children. Also, the front door has two peepholes for the same purpose. - I stayed in November and without a pair of slippers it was very cold to walk barefoot on a bathroom floor. (I had the same problem at the Intercontinental in the neighbourhood.) - There is a decent hair dryer in the room - powerful and emitting negative ion - The lights in the bathroom are too dim, even with the dimming controls. You cannot apply makeup in the dark. - Has a unique stock in the mini-bar, such as sleeping pills. - Front doors are heavy thus the hotel needs to fix the door-slamming problem. - Has a motorised shade control system - The bed is quite comfortable - The room is kept clean - Has a heated towel rack Prior to my trip, I read several reviews on noise complaints, so I emailed the manager Nina (nina.sweet@morganshotelgroup.com) and requested that my room be secured in the quiet part of the building. Thanks to her, someone who stayed on the 14th floor was annoyed by the noise but I on the 8th floor had no problem. My overall experience was so delightful that I ended up extending my stay for another night (my company was paying :p) and would come back to the Ames in future.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cThe best holiday experience!!\u201d", "Author": "Raghav M", "ReviewID": "UR122140679", "Content": "Our stay at the Ames was exemplary.

They promptly sent housekeeping after apologizing, but we had to wait almost an hour for the rooms to be cleaned, and when we returned to the room we found that they had done a rushed job. The front desk gave us drink vouchers for Woodwards to make up for the room debacle. We noticed in the night stand drawer there was a note with ear plugs (see pic) , we were perplexed by it but didn't think anything of it until...that same night, around 3:30-4am in the morning we were woken up by loud music and intimate sounds, because the paper thin walls do not keep noise out. This happened again the second night too! Both times Lindsay at front desk was called to which security was promptly sent up. We could even hear the knock on their door! Both times we found a note in the morning under our door apologizing for the noise and vouchers for brunch to Woodwards. Despite the above, we would give Ames another try again.

I have family nearby so it was more for fun than true need of shelter, but I thought I would give it a try. The Ames is located basically in the Financial District of Boston, meaning it is centrally located but not in the hipper part of the city. That said, this is Boston so everything is extremely close together. My experience at the Ames was generally very positive. I booked the most basic room, which I found to be nice but not overwhelmingly well appointed. In truth, the space I was given felt like something of a cement box. I entitle this entry \"True Urban Minimalism\" largely because a minimalist aesthetic can sometimes add up to just that -- very little. I can appreciate how the design of the space was somewhat thoughtful, but in the case of my room it seemed that something was missing. That said, service was terrific. I neglected to bring a few items and they were promptly brought to my room. The following morning, I was informed that room service was unavailable due to an issue in the kitchen. While I was disappointed, an hour later I was brought up a complimentary tray of pastries and juice. While I was about to leave and couldn't actually enjoy them, it was a nice gesture. It must be noted that I booked my room on Last Minute Travel, so I payed only $140 for my room and therefore had lowered expectations of what my experience would be. For what I paid I feel that the experience was Very Good. However, if I had paid more I might have been disappointed, particularly given the austerity of the room. A companion traveler ended up in the next level of accommodation, and his room was not particularly notable either (save for the \"sexy\" glass shower, which it should be noted is not a feature of the basic room).", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nanuet, New York", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel Great Location\u201d", "Author": "Dawn A", "ReviewID": "UR121401310", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here after our wedding for a minimoon.

We celebrated are wedding week at the Ames, my wife and I stayed at the Ames last year, the exact same weekend of the wedding just so we can have an idea how the weather would be so we could prepare our friend and family from Miami, FL. It has been such a marvelous experience working with Executive Assistant Julie Guerra at the Ames, she made all the arrangements and it was a breeze to coordinate everything with her and the hotel staff. In all honesty, they treated our 28 guests like family, there were no complaints just continued waves of compliments from our guests. The rooms are beautiful, clean and modern. The beds are so yummy, it made it hard to get out of bed some mornings. The location is perfect, take the shuttle at the airport to the blue line, and the blue line to state, the hotel is right across the street, you will get there in less than 10 mins. It's only a short drive from the airport, trust me I made several trips this past week. Faneuil Hall is right next to the hotel with plenty of shops and bars, shopping is just down the street, H&M, Macy's and several other stores are just a couple of blocks away. There are trolley tours that can take you around town. The blue/orange line is on state, and the blue/green government center line is behind the hotel. Since we needed to apply for our marriage license, city hall was just next to the hotel, less than a five minute walk. There are several banks nearby, and CVS if you need water or other essentials. The hotel is in a centralized location, and easily accessible via public transportation. The minute you get out of the car, the most cordial and helpful doormen, like Nick, Brandon, Ralique (I may be butchering the spelling of his name, sorry) and the other gentlemen who took wonderful care of us, greet you with a warm smile. The concierge Charles is phenomenal, he arranged transportation for our guest to the wedding location a few blocks away, and took care of any logistical concerns we had. My mom and my cousins are in love with him, he is just amazing. The front-desk staff, the amazing Rosy, Mary, Alison, Janelle, Frances, Kimberly, and Ben, they are always there to greet you with a smile, and always taking care of your every need. No reasonable request was every denied, we thank you for putting up with us the days leading to the wedding. Housekeeping is always on point the rooms are always spotless, and well-taken care, extra towels and toiletries are provided within minutes of request and always with a smile and pleasantries. We loved Deanna on the 14th floor; she took excellent care of us the whole week, even our dog Lenny is in love with her. Cecelia, I think she is head of housekeeping, she is an angel, she treated our dog like VIP, and the rest of housekeeping were always patient and kind. Downstairs at the Woodward, great service, excellent food, amazing selection of cocktails, beer and wine, Jake was our main server for the week, he and the manager Dana took excellent care of everyone all week. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think we ate breakfast or dinner anywhere else while in town. Everyone was sad to leave the Ames; no one wanted to go back home.

We were traveling with a baby, and I don't know if the put us there as opposed to a higher floor to keep from disturbing other guests or what.

You are about a 5/10 minute walk from Boston Common on one side and the North End on the other. You're even closer than that to Quincy Market. If you can help it, don't drive in Boston! There are tons of tunnels close to this area, and it's very east to get turned around. We had room service for dirr and lunch one day. The food is from the kitchen of the Woodward restaurant, and it was good. We also walked to Mike's Pastry one morning for cannoli. It was amazing, and you feel a little less guilty about it after all the walking you do in the city. The only other warning is that there is a big homeless shelter right next door to the hotel.

We had breakfast twice as well as a nightcap at their restaurant The Woodward. On all occasions the service, food and drinks were exceptional.

The staff at the Ames, and the hotel itself, FAR exceeded my expectations. We were coming on July 4th, a very busy day for Boston, so I made sure to email Nina, the hotel manager, a few days before arrival to make sure everything was confirmed for our check in. She replied quickly and showed a ton of personal attention and wished my boyfriend and I a pleasant stay during our impending anniversary. This was just the beginning of the exemplary service we received at the Ames. Upon arrival in Boston, we went straight to the Ames, which was in an ideal location. Less than a ten minute walk from the train station, and only steps away from everything in the heart of the city. Quincy Market/Fanueil Hall was across the street! Boston Commons were a few blocks over! Even the North End was only a short walk! My guy and I didn't need to use public transit ONCE on our trip and we went EVERYWHERE and did everything someone in Boston would want to do. Perfect location. The hotel was also mentioned on our duck tour for being the tallest building in Boston before steel (etc) was used for skyscrapers. We felt awesome that our hotel was such a great landmark! The hotel is very modern. It's very swanky, sexy, minimalist and contemporary in design. Walking in, we both gasped at how beautiful it was. We were three hours early for check out, but the nice man who checked us in said we could go to our room early, and handed up brochures listing all of the July 4th activities, which was nice. We ended up in a corner suite, which I'm sure was Nina's doing after my email. What a spectacular (and much appreciated) surprise! After coming back from a few hours of sight seeing, a knock was heard on the door. Room service had come to bring a bottle of champagne for us, accompanied by a hand written note from Nina wishing us a fabulous stay and a happy anniversary. I've never seen such spectacular customer service at a hotel. As if I couldn't be knocked out of the park enough, this put it over the top! The sheets and bed were SO comfy. The room is decorated in such a relaxing way, we spent one afternoon just in the room (drinking our anniversary champagne!) because it was so pleasant to be in! Giant TV as well! The shower was HUGE with a rainwater shower head. The Ames also had, by far, the best toiletries I've ever used in a hotel. Fantastic quality products. We also loved using the towel heater. The room/hotel was exquisite, the service outstanding, and Nina and her staff made it certain that the Ames is the only hotel in Boston we will stay at when we return! It was such a memorable trip because of these special touches only a truly exceptional hotel knows how to provide.

We kept our voices low after the complaint and again, there was a knock at the door to quiet us. This was at midnight on a Sat. night and your bar was not welcoming at all. We were speaking in normal tones when a third time knock came and we were all escorted out by not 1, not 2, but 3 security people who acted as if we were in there with coke and hookers. It was completely ridiculous. We are all over 40, professionals and responsible people who at the most had 1 or 2 drinks at your bar. Which brings me to earlier at the bar when I asked for a Stoli Razberi and soda he just said no. I said, OK, I'll have any raspberry vodka and he shortly said we don't have raspberry vodka. I said, what flavors DO you have? Exasperated, he says blueberry and orange. I said I'll have orange then. SOooo not the way to get a drink order in my opinion. He was very haughty and impatient and it was not crowded. I also have to mention that our room was the tiniest I have seen outside of London.

But you'd never know it from the website. So 1). It's clean (phew), but so are lots of other hotels in Boston. For a lot less wonga. 2). A good night's sleep? Hmmmm. If you call being woken up by blaring police sirens five times a night \"a good night's sleep\", then yes it was. But it's the perfect central location by day, so you make sacrifices. 3). Certain levels of comfort. Call me old-fashioned, but I like nothing better than snuggling up in a complimentary dressing gown after my shower.

The Morgans group needs to invest in a sign above/near the main entrance. If you are not familiar with the location, you could do as we did and drive past it twice. Some signage is a practical necessity and doesn't dampen the hip factor. There should also be an investment for a larger workout room. The present space has decent equipment, however it is more like a workout closet than a room. It felt cramped to me and I was in it alone. For many guests, a useable workout facility is important. This one needs enlargement. My final complaint is a petty one and pertains to the hotel bar. For the most part, the hotel bar is a very nice feature - well designed and solid bartending. (The upstairs space was closed for an event when I was there.) I had two drinks during my stay - one was amazing (best Manhattan I've ever had) and the other was disappointing. The let down was a Maccallan 12 yr scotch I ordered that was literally measured out to exactly a shot. Not a drop more. I expect to be charged city, hotel prices, but hate a weak pour.

The staff there were all very friendly and outgoing to make it our experience at the Ames great.

Also, since we were on vacation, we slept in and didn't get going until later in the morning so housekeeping had already finished our floor. We let the front desk know and each day after that housekeeping stopped by later in the day for our room. Everyone that we spoke with from the Ames was very friendly and outgoing, making for a great stay. The decor was very modern, simple and elegant. We were in a King Room and the actual space was adequate, but with the high ceilings and large windows it felt much bigger. The hardwood floors were a really nice touch. Also, everything was spotless in our room. That along with a really comfortable bed made the Ames a perfect spot to come back to each night. There was some city noise, we noticed a few ambulances going by each night, but with this being in the middle of a big city that is to be expected. We were able to take advantage of a discount by prepaying for our room a few months in advance. By doing that the price of the Ames was less than other comparable hotels in the surrounding area.

I could hear people talk, hear the TV like it was in my room...so if you're thinking about staying here for a romantic gateway, or to relax in a quiet room, just forget it. The noise was so bad it would wake me up when guests in the next room came back in the early hours... 2) WHERE IS THE LOBBY. And the warm welcome? When I was dropped in front of the hotel and came into the hotel, I thought is this a joke. It felt like I was going clubbing....the lobby is definitely not a lobby. There are two tiny little elevators (you don't fit more than 2 here) and it takes forever to go to the higher levels. On this comment, maybe it's me not liking the boutique hotel concept stretched to a maximum 3) E-UPGRADES=RIP-OFFS. The e-upgrades you will receive by email seem a bit desperate, like they want to make money so bad. Unfortunately, it worked for me. I selected a room on a higher floor, because I wanted to have a nicer view. The windows were just so small, felt like prison (see the picture) 4) ROOMS NOT WELL MAINTAINED. The decor is very nice, I very much like the concept, however, don't expect \"quality\". In my room, the light in the bathroom was making this annoying sound, it feels like whoever painted the walls was drunk, and the tv remote control worked 1 time out of 10...

In the week prior to our arriving in Boston, I emailed Nina to introduce myself and mention to her how much we were looking forward to our stay.. She responded the following day and stated that she had upgraded our room from the standard queen we had booked to a Deluxe King. Additionally, she has provided us with complimentary internet use during our stay, which is allowing me to write this review at no cost.. The pictures posted of the hotel are accurate in that the hotel is very hip and asthetically pleasing to the eyes. Additionally, the room is very comfortable with wood and marble flooring,12 foot ceilings and a window that likely measures 10ft by 6 ft, a 40in flat panel television, very comfortable bed, refridgerator, a safe large enough to store a laptop, complimentary toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, lotion, soap, and body wash) and bath robes.

The hotel was a certain cool vibe that is hard to explain -- is it the music and giant convex mirror in the elevator, the sharpened pencil lying perfectly on your room desk, or the orange sweaters the doormen wear? I don't know and I don't care. All I know is top notch service with a smile + an amazing room with a beautiful view in the best part of town (5 minute walk to the pier and Legal Seafoods and and right across the street from a subway stop) = Excellent! If I was forced to register one area of improvement I'd probably say the gym. It's an older building so they did what they could and certainly have a lot of modern cardio + free weights + machines.

Because I booked so early, I also got a special rate which was significantly less than the posted rates. So, I was happy. But then we got there on Friday (2/18) and were upgraded to the 12th floor suite- holy-mother-of-awesome! Like the public areas of the hotel, the suite was a sleek deep gray and white, with windows about knee height up to the top of the 10 foot ceilings. Lightweight white drapes from ceiling to floor filtered the light beautifully and combined with the light hardwood floor gave warmth to what could have been cold modernity. The bedroom and bathroom were equally sleek and kind of sexy and contained toiletries you actually want to use- they smelled fantastic! The shower- oh that shower- large enough for two with glass and white marble walls and a rain shower head and handheld was a vacation in itself. Linens were all crisp and white- something we truly appreciated considering our two big black dogs at home (crisp and white don't exist in our world), but I digress. You might wonder why we only gave sleep quality a 4 out of 5- the mattress was a bit firm for us. But that doesn't mean we didn't sleep. ;-) Housekeeping was very good- so clean you could have eaten from the floor, though I don't recommend it. On to the service- you can not imagine how helpful the Ames staff was. Given it's location and decor, it would have been entirely possible for them to be tragically hip and too cool for school. While dressed that way (cute uniforms- esp. for the desk staff), they were all incredibly warm and friendly, most notably Charles, the concierge. Charles, while not only infinitely knowledgeable about the city, was quite charming as well. Being laid back and low-key, we were looking for places to eat that matched that description. Both places he sent us fit the bill perfectly- especially Mother Anna's. The food was delicious and the place homey. Charles also gave us menu recommendations based on some of his favorites at each place- and had that glorious eggplant rollatini waiting when we arrived. I could go on about Charles and his infinite awesomeness, but I'm sure you get the picture. As far as food goes, the Woodward was delicious- we had drinks and dinner there and brunch as well. They mix a great bloody mary and the 1692 Brew is not to be missed. The complete menu was also available for room service which we ordered our second morning there and when we had the sourdough blueberry pancakes- to die for! Lastly- the location could not have been better. A very short walk in one direction gets you to the blue and orange lines and to the red and green in another. We were also right on the Freedom Trail, a short walk to Boston Commons, the State House and a multitude of other sites. Overall, this was a great place to stay. We actually spent a fair amount of time in our room because it was so cold outside, and that was as enjoyable as anything else we did.

Nina Sweet the Assistant Front Desk Manager is a Superstar. When I had to extend my stay due to the weather she went out of her way to accomodate me.

We stay in Boston relatively often, and had wanted to check out the Ames for some time now, but because we usually travel with our dogs, we typically stay at the Mandarin or at the Marlowe in Cambridge. This time we got a pet sitter, and were able to stay at the Ames. Pros: The location is excellent, with many good restaurants in the area, and Faneuil Hall and Quincy Market, as well as Long Wharf, all within a few minute walk. The building is historic, and the design inside the hotel is great. Not sure how all the white will hold up over time, and can certainly understand why the hotel is not pet friendly, but for the time being, the rooms look awesome. The glass wall showers are a great touch for couples, but could be awkward for others. Without exception, every single staff member we interacted with were extremely nice and pleasant. From the bellhop, front desk, room service, to all the restaurant staff, everyone was so nice! All the food was really good as well. We had dinner at Woodward on the first night, and everything was very, very good. Service was prompt and attentive, and we had a wonderful time. We also ordered breakfast from room service one morning, and it also was fantastic. Props to the kitchen! Overall, this hotel is a good value, at least compared to some other places in Boston. Style-wise, this place is really hip, with cool people, cool design, and a cool vibe overall. Cons: Only a few rooms have tubs. Sometimes it is nice to soak in a big hotel tub, but in this case, at least the showers were huge and... entertaining. There is some noise. It didn't bother us, but you could definitely hear emergency vehicles and the subway from time to time. Not a big deal, but if you are not used to city noise, or are like the tomb like feeling at the Four Seasons, Mandarin, or Ritz, this may not be for you. No spa. It would be great if there were even a small spa with steam room, sauna, and massage services. I think appointments can be booked in room, but it is just not the same.

Now 1 1/2 hours into the snafu check in process, they switched our room upon our complaint about the shower, and the young man who brought the key joked that they would pay for any therapy my son would need at the thought of his mother showering.

As we walked the neighborhood after our yucky meal we found several other much better restaurants for half the price. I slept on an uncomfortable roll away instead of a comfy bed. For $411 a night.

It is walking distance to most points of interests and close to 2 T-stations but so are many hotels in the various Boston districts. There are not many restaurants nearby but there are many fast food places. It is not an ideal hotel for families but convenient for young singles or couples.

I'm really glad I did! Price: for decent hotels in the area, this was actually one of the less expensive, corporate rate or not. Location: EXCELLENT! This hotel is right next to (literally, almost on top of) the Old State House Museum and the Boston Massacre site. From here I also walked to the 5!wits TOMB exhibit, to the Boston Gardens, to the Blue Man Group, to the Cheers bar, (none was more than about 1.5 miles tops) and I walked every day down to the wharf where my conference was and stopped to eat at a lot of great places - Legal Seafood, Quincy Market, Oceania all right there. Location felt safe. Didn't want to go down side streets much but otherwise great on the main paths. Parking/transport: don't even think about it...taxi here, taxi back. I have no idea where you would park, but it would be expensive. You're very close to mass transit too...subway about 1/2 mile away I think (down by the aquarium, might be something closer) Decor: OMG, this was the best part. The room is seriously like something in a modern art museum. Skinny chrome lamps, white bed, dark grey walls and floors in the bath, wood floor in the bedroom, white bedding, red table, comfy chair, translucent walls. Only bad things are that the dark floor shows footprints really easily (they keep it clean though) and the room requires a lot of thought - everything has a control panel and most things require some thinking to operate...which can also be kind of a fun adventure :) The faux fur blanket on the bed is the awesomest thing. So soft...I seriously considered buying one from the hotel (they will sell you almost anything in the room if you asked). For such an old building you can tell it's been remodeled very recently. Shower was nice - multiple heads. Sad there was no bathtub though... I don't know if there are in some of the nicer rooms, but there wasn't in the standard one. Amenities: Didn't check out the bar/restaurant, but there's always a party going on. Wouldn't want to be on the bottom most floor when it's really going, but it looked like fun. The exercise room is nice though...not huge, but a lot of equipment, all very new, lots of variety. Staff is incredibly helpful...all know a lot about the rooms and the area and very friendly. A few misses on the part of the housekeeping staff (forgot some toiletries, nothing major), but everyone else was incredibly professional. Check in/out was a breeze.

Overall, the hotel was okay. Very nice bath products, great flat screen television, check-in moved smoothly, bed comfortable, very responsive when I asked for a linen change. There were just a few issues that colored our trip. We had been extremely excited to stay at the Ames since it first opened and we heard all the reviews. The place is very much like a W Hotel (fashion forward decor with a scene in the restaurant/bar). That part was interesting and cool. Due to reading previous reviews, I made sure to ask for a room on a high floor to avoid any noise. The woman desk clerk was very helpful and immediately offered us a room on the 14th floor. Check-in went smoothly. -People have complained about the dark hallways, but I didn't find that to be a problem. The ambiance was nice and it was bright enough to see everything you'd possibly want to see in a hallway! The problem was there really is a lot of noise you can hear from the street (14 floors below!) and the bar at night. The windows must not be double paned because you can hear actual conversations from the patio if the people are speaking loudly. I'm not joking. Because we spent the majority of time out of the room, this wasn't a problem. However, each night we came back to the hotel around 1am (Fri. & Sat. night) and the noise was pretty loud. So, if you're staying at the Ames for business, you may want to take that into consideration. Also, once we made our way to the room after checking in we walked in and noticed black marks on one wall and a hair pendant left from a previous guest. The bathroom shower was also not cleaned adequately. My sister and I aren't squeamish, so we just let those things go. However, the level of scuff marks on the white walls was truly unsatisfactory. The main problem we had with the Ames were the bugs we kept finding running around the hotel room. It was seriously disturbing. We saw silverfish and this other black amoeba looking bug that I had no idea what it was. It was inky black and very hard to kill. They seemed to come out the most at night. -When checking out, I thought I'd mention the bug issue so they could spray the room and save another hotel guest from suffering through that. I mentioned it to the guy at the front desk when checking out & he was wholly disinterested. As I started to tell him about the bugs, he looked down at his computer and was so uninterested and dismissive as to what I had to say that he wouldn't even make eye contact. He started typing and uh huhing me (as in, yeah- whatever). I finished telling him about the bugs. He still wouldn't look up from the computer, so I left. -For that reason, it is unlikely I'll ever stay at the Ames again. If they're so uninterested about a bug infestation, I have no desire to stay in a hotel like that. For the prices they charge, I expect very clean rooms. I felt on edge all weekend and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to walk barefoot in the room.

The plush platform bed, the bedding, the ipod radio, the glass walled shower which creates the most unique room divider between bath and bedroom, the panoramic window wall with city view.

They were doing a photo shoot and the food for the photo shoot took precedence. That really sums up my opinion of the place - all about them not about the guest. The front desk person apologized and said that she was taking my tea off the bill and last laugh on me it was on my final bill after all. All flash and no cache! Loved the TAJ!!!
