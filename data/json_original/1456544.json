I have travelled a lot all over the world, and stayed in many, many hotels. Hotellino is definitely in my top 5 favorite hotel experiences because of the level of service and friendliness of the owners. So many hotels try to nickle-and-dime you these days, but Hotellino understands that the value of happy customers is much greater than making an extra 1 lira on a bottle of water. The great things about Hotellino: free wifi throughout the hotel, 3 free bottles of water per day, free (included) breakfast buffet with many hot item food choices, and best of all, free advice and travel recommendations from the hotel owners. The owner Mina (sp?) speaks with all the guests every morning and offers advice on the best things to see, eat, and do every day. She knows Istanbul very well and was able to give us many recommendations for less touristy places, and she and her husband helped us make reservations and plan our itinerary each day we were there. She is not pushy at all - it truly feels like being welcomed into someone's home, and they want to make you feel comfortable and enjoy your stay. For example, a friend of ours was staying at another nearby hotel, and Mina invited him to join us for breakfast (for free) every morning of our stay. Remarkable hospitality. The hotel meets all the basic requirements as well - it is very conveniently located to the major attractions, 24-hour check in for late arrivals, rooms are very clean and modern, beds are comfortable, minibar, in-room coffee making facility, in-room safe, good air-conditioning system in the rooms, and our room on the 4th floor was quiet. There are hundreds of hotels in Istanbul, but don't look any further - you will be happy with Hotellino. If I ever return to Istanbul, I will stay there again.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxford", "Title": "\u201cSuper Hotellino\u201d", "Author": "Marilyn M", "ReviewID": "UR128065767", "Content": "We have just returned from a four night stay at the super Hotellino hotel.

If you go on a city trip, this should be considered to avoid fares for transport. We had a room on the 5th floor. There was a small balcony to step on with a nice view to G\u00c3\u00bclhane Park, Galata Tower etc. We should have chosen a room with 2 beds, since our bed was small (we are tall people). Then there was a construction site on Sirkeci train station that was very loud the whole night, there was a disturbing noise from trucks going backwards. Can't blame the hotel for that since the noise was in the whole area. Generally it is clean, but with very little effort it could be cleaner. We found foreign hair on the floor when stepping in our room for the first time, one window had stains that were obvious and were not removed during our 5-days- stay and will be there now I guess. Thats not a big deal for a cleaning person with eyes in the head, right? And when you encounter stains like that you start asking yourself about the cleanliness in the whole room. Gives a bad feeling. Breakfast was great, there was everything you needed. We liked the sesam-rings very much. If they ran out of someting it was refilled immediately. Good service also on the reception and good information by the owners, although it was a bit weird on Sunday, when \" the boss\" was there. Breakfast room was crowded and he was walking up and down the buffet all the time....desperatly trying to give information. It depends what you pay for the room if the hotel can be recommended.

It is very conveniently located, between the Sirkeci and Gulhane tram stops (you can use either) and close to the Sirkeci train station and ferry piers. You can walk to most of the sights on this side of the harbour if you don't mind walking. I arrived late at night and it took a while and some asking for directions to find the hotel because it was at a side street among many other side streets next to the tramline. Luckily even at about 11PM the streets were quite well lit with some shops / restaurants open so it did not feel unsafe for me to walk alone. I noted the next day that there was indeed signage pointing to the hotel on the way from the Sirkeci tram stop but it was not obvious or easy to see. The directions on the hotel's website were very useful. The room I had was comfortable and had everything I needed. OK bed, clean bathroom, fridge with free bottled water, electric kettle, TV with international news channels, and wifi. The only thing that I was not completely happy with was that it was on the first floor (one floor above the ground level) and right next to my window there was a bright neon sign of the hotel next door. So I had to keep the curtains drawn tight and there was a little noise from the street (just a little, not annoying). The breakfast was adequate and the staff/manager were very friendly. The lady manager seemed to make it a point to greet and chat with different guests during breakfast time every morning, and she was helpful.

The last visit to Istanbul was 15 years ago so was keen to re-visit. The flight with Easyjet into Sabiha Gokcen Airport was superb. Then the Havas bus into Taksim and a bus then down to the waterfront opposite Sirkeci Station and then a very short walk to the hotel. The hotel is in a very quiet back street and our room on the top (5th) floor had a superb view over the rooftops towards the Bosphorus (unfortunately a dingy multi-storey car park blocked what could be an even better view). The room was very spacious with a small balcony and a fully fitted bathroom with everything you needed plus free bottles of water in fridge. The breakfast in the little front cafe was superb with a splendid array of food and drink and the staff so willing to help. Unfortunately we never met the owner. A short walk up to the tram station Gulhane took you anywhere you needed to go. With a dodgy knee found this the best form of transport and purchased the Istanbul card which enabled travel on tram, bus, train, ferry and funicular. Istanbul isn't geared up for disabilities so you do have to take care. There are loads of restaurants around the hotel if you can get past the owners who stand outside in all weathers trying to entice you in but it is all meant in good humour.

Furniture is very high quality and the small touches in the room such as pictures give it a cosy feel. The air conditioning in the room is very powerful, which is not so in other less quality hotels. The bathroom was spotless and modern with a powerful shower. It also had the interesting feature of a window into the bedroom (you can shut blinds in the window if you don't like the idea!). Not that you will watch much TV in Istanbul but channels included CNN and BBC World Service. The free wifi was quick enough to watch You tube and use Skype. Other nice touches included lovely products to use in the bathroom, 3 free bottles of water per person each day, slippers and robes. Service: This was perhaps the most impressive thing about Hotellino. Staff could not do more to make you feel welcome and give extremely useful advice. We had a warm welcome at the hotel by the receptionist who was at the desk throughout the night (guy with an earring sorry I can't remember your name!). He also spent a lot of time arrange trips and booking restaurants as did the other staff. During breakfast the owner of the hotel gives you priceless advice about the city. She told us about lovely restaurants which are the best I have ever eaten in. A really nice touch was being given a bag of Turkish coffee on check out. If it was not for all of this excellent service from the whole team we would have missed out on some special things which Istanbul has to offer. Location: Hotellino is on a quite street which is a rare thing in this part of Istanbul but round the corner is everything you need. It is 5min walk to a tram stop which gives fast and reliable transport to the rest of the city. It is also a 5-10min walk from Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque.

We booked 10 nights in Istanbul as the destination seemed to see and learn from history that displays east meets west culture. This hotel was chosen upon reading numerous reviews from tripadvisor. Altough me and my wife enjoyed our stay I wanted to be honest and open about my experience at staying at Hotellino. Check In; It was straightforward, and all that was required was copies of our passport and a signature. Room/s; Having insisted we wanted a double room, we were provided with a twin bed room, and the beds had been joined together! We had two single duvet covers and the matteresses were uneven in the middle! Not a great start. Our shower kept becoming blocked and we needed a member a staff to sort this. During our ten night stay we were asked to move in a 'proper' double room, and we got the feeling this was for the hotels convenience to accomodate more guest in the twin room, rather than looking out for us as guest. Internet access; There is a computer in the looby which provides instant fast internet access for guest, although the staff seem to regularly use this computer. They have free wifi access in all the room, however the internet was down for the last few days and there was no urgency for the staff to sort this out even though we had mentioned this on a number of occassions. Breakfast; Simple, continental breakfast with a few local additions such as turkish delights and halwa. To claim a 'boutique hotel' I was dissapointed with the spread. The staff helping out at breakfast were excellent and very helpful to plan your day. Environment; Little did we know that major roadworks was going on outside the hotel, this was very inconvenient, we had to drag our suitcases through cement and dirt and there was constant noise during the day and loud noise from a nearby generator throughout the night. TV; There was only a selection of English speaking channels. No movie channels so you couldnt kick back and relax in the room, only plenty of 'news' channels and channels in other languages. I would suggest undertaking a survey with guest to determine the languages spoken by guest and provide channels in accordance. Rates; The rates at Hotellino in comparision to other nearby hotels, which do have provide 'spa and fitness facilities is high. I booked this hotel upon reading the reviews on Tripadvisor. I would suggest typing in 'Sultanahmet Hotels, Istanbul'. This will refine your search in the Old City and open your search to other nearby hotels which look very good having walked around the area for 10 days, which may not be on Tripadvisor. Chekout; This was simple only requiring my card details, although I did need to silence the reception staff from reading aloud my total bill! Istanbul as a location; We had a wonderful time in Istanbul, particularly visiting the old palaces, mosques and museums. In future we would only stay a maximum of five nights, I think staying 10 night was more than we needed. Many shop workers ask where you come from, this is a tool to persuade you to walk in the shop and prices are provided on this basis!

For old read rough. Everything you would wish to see is within easy walking distance \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Spice Market, Central Market, tramway, the river \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Hotellino is a lovely little hotel, friendly staff. Breakfast consists of simple Middle Eastern fare. Rooms are spacious and clean, but no view other than of a yard. Free water in room. Free internet. Free wi-fi. Fee safe. Free fridge. Turkish delight for breakfast! And halva too! Delicious walnuts and dried apricots. These I added to my muesli. Large pots of jam, a spoonful went well on toast. There was fresh fruit salad but I missed fresh fruit. You are spoilt for choice for places to eat for the rest of the day. Try hot chestnuts off the street vendors and fresh grilled mackerel down by the river. An absolute must is fresh crushed pomegranate juice. The rooms are spacious They lack a decent view, but so what, you have got legs. Plenty of cupboards and drawers. A long glass-topped table with a bench seat which could also serve as a writing desk. Paper and envelopes provided. A notepad and pencil by the bedside. A very good bathroom. Lovely coconut oil shampoo. The soap had a lovely spicy smell, not the usual sweet scent. But what it was I could not say, and try as I did, I could not find any soap like it. An electric hairdryer in the bathroom not a good idea. The bathroom also had a phone! I was baffled by a window from the bedroom into the bathroom, looking into the shower! Maybe some like to put on show! Dotted around the lounge were some excellent books on Istanbul. Passers through leave their books behind for others to share. I suggested Hotellino register as a BookCrossing zone. Very quiet. A level of environmental awareness at Hotellino. The paper used was unbleached, lights turned off when you left the room. But polystyrene cups in the rooms! Not pleasant to drink from and very bad for the environment. I was at a St Joseph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Day Party at Pera Place Hotel and I was given a list of hotels nearby but pleased I did not make the mistake of staying there. A ten Turkish lire taxi ride away from the old part of Istabul and some taxis will try to rip you off with 15 Turkish lire or more. I looked at two other hotels in the old city, Askin Hotel and Askoc Hotel. They had views of the Mosques and the Bosphorus but bad reviews on Trip Advisor on the other hand Hotellino had excellent reviews and it is easy to see why. Whereas many hotels especially those owned by faceless corporations take every opportunity to rip you off, with Hotellino it is what can we do to help you? The staff from the manager down are very helpful and friendly. Not the usual plastic smiles. An ideal hotel for the independent traveller within easy walking distance of places worth visiting and the tram stop and train station are only a few minutes walk away. A nice touch on my leaving was to be given a pack of Turkish coffee with instructions on how to make. I was also on leaving handed a large postcard. The front showing a map of the old part of Istanbul and on the back thanking me for my visit and asking that I post comments on Trip Advisor.

However, I must say how extremely disappointed I was to have booked a full 6 months ahead, and to have received a confirmation from the hotel one week prior to my stay, only to find that there was no room available for me upon arrival. The staff, then, took me to a very mediocre hotel across the street; the room I was given was dark, musty and with an attrocious bathroom that absolutely stank of sewer. See pics below. This room should not have any relation to Hotellino; however, I wasted time unpacking and re-packing, checking in here and checking in there, and one night of my holiday was spent in quite sub-standard accomodation for which, at the end of my stay, Hotellino offered a very modest compensation of 50% off for one night. Yes, the staff apologized. Yes, they went out of their way to be sure I was comfortable afterwards. But I did, nonetheless, feel somewhat cheated by the experience. My room at Hotellino, however, was quite nice; small and modern, nicely furnished, comfortable bed and spotlessly clean bathroom, in-room safe, etc. View was nothing to write home about, but who comes to Istanbul to look out the window? The hotel, not even a year old at this point, is in great condition and everything's very nice. I loved the breakfast and found that there was always plenty of choice; if some item of food ran low during the breakfast rush, the lovely staff would instantly bring more. Fruit salad was particularly nice, as was the fresh arrugula, parsley and tomato and great cheeses. Very good coffee, as well. The staff are young and friendly, helpful and chatty; hotel is small enough so that you can get to know them a bit and have a laugh. Sevgi, in particular, was a delight, and offered lots of suggestions for transport and places to visit. But all the staff - at the desk and in the cafe - were really pleasant. For a first time visitor to Istanbul, the location can't be beat. Hotellino is within walking disatance to the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sofia, Topkapi Palace, Sirkeci Station and ferry boats of Eminonu.
