This was my third trip to Rome but my first time staying in the ancient city. The Pantheon was just around the corner from the Pantheon Inn! The hotel itself is a mix of hotel rooms and residentially occupied apartments. I thought this added to the experience of living as close to a local as possible without staying with a family. First of all the hotel staff were very welcoming and helpful. The front desk answered and anticipated all my questions, and were very always warm and friendly. They even provided an easy to follow map of the area. The houskeeper was always happy and pleasant and kept our room well with clean towels and toiletries. The staff kept the breakfast area clean and well stocked at all times. She even assisted in getting the three of us to sit at a table together when it didn't appear to have one available. The breakfast area provided standard breakfast buffet items; croissants, rolls, danishes, doughnuts, meats and cheese, milk cereal, yoghurts, fresh fruit, fruit cocktail, a machine with coffee, cappucino, macchiato, fruit juice, hot chocolate and tea. We never left hungry or disappointed. The rooms were clean, and room decore was nice, not sparse nor too overdone. Lighting was ample, and an in-room fridge was provided, stocked with items to purchase. The King sized bed was comfortable and the bed linens were adequate. The pillows were a little on the flat side for my taste, but having stayed in Italy before, this seems to be standard. Our 9 year old had her own roll away bed and she seemed happy about it, and comfortable. The in-room complimentary Internet was handy, but not functioning for only one of the days we were there. The flat screen television was digital, and had very poor spotty reception. Of course only one channel had English, but the poor TV reception didn't impact our stay in the least. Our one window faced the church in the Piazza Minerva. We listened to the church bells from our room, which really added to the atmpsphere and the rooftop views. Late at night only if the window was open you could hear some street noise (late night partiers). Nothing terribly inconveinient though. Check out the interior of this church... We were so surprised when we finally walked inside!! Staying at the Pantheon Inn, we were within walking distance to all the piazzas and historical sites. We walked to Piazza Navona, The Trevi Fountain, the Coloseum, the Forums, The Vatican and the Spanish Steps. The only transportation we used was expertly and graciously arranged by the hotel staff for a private shuttle to and from the airport. It was the most hassle free way to travel for two adults and a 9 year old who don't speak any Italian. We can't say enough great things about our stay at the Panethon Inn.", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Holland, Michigan, United States", "Title": "\u201cGreat location once you can find it\u201d", "Author": "Ken H", "ReviewID": "UR127230808", "Content": "We loved the clean rooms and friendly staff, but the best feature was its location.

The building is apparently also used for a few offices, and has a courtyard that looks like it belongs to a private home. There is a tiny elevator available about four steps up the stairs, and you have to select floor 2 to get to the hotel lobby.

The noise was unbearable so we weren't able to take the nap we had hoped for. This was disappointing. Our room was also right below the kitchen area so we could hear people walking up and down the stairs pretty clearly. Sometimes we could smell the public toilet when walking into the hotel.

But on arrival, we were told that they had a \"problem\", and only had two rooms available in this location, and wanted to split up our party with one room in another hotel at some distance. This was unacceptable, so we ended up squeezing 6 into two rooms set up for four people for one night. This hotel had the nerve to charge us for three rooms for that first night, supposedly because they booked a room elsewhere. Not my problem! I received no compensation or consideration for our discomfort. Thus, my \"poor\" rating. In the absence of this annoyance and disappointment, I might have considered \"average\" to be appropriate. It was not that clean, and expanding on the infrastructure issues mentioned by others: Every visitor has to deal with some steps, starting with several up to the very small elevator (only accommodating 2 or 3 people - without bags! - 1 or 2 with bags), and a number of steps to get to breakfast, and many rooms have steps to access. Certainly not a good place for anyone with mobility problems, or if trying to push a stroller. None of the rooms in one portion of the building have telephones.

Breakfast is the only meal served at the hotel but with the abundance of cafes, bars and restaurants a short walk away this really isn't a problem.

The Pantheon is literally around the corner, The Trevi Fountain is a 10 minute walk away as is the Piaza Navona - a great place for a spot of people watching. The earlier you get up, the better your view point as the streets are still crowded at 10pm. Highlights = Collosseum, Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps and The Vatican City.

It is very rustic looking but those who are seasoned travelers will realize the beauty of the door and its historic value. The price for the location of the inn is a plus as well.

If you are going to book a room, let me give you directions that will save you a litlte trouble finding it.

It will be around fifty to seventy yards down the street on the right. The only indication of its existence is a small brass plaque on the building beside the two big green doors.

The story goes as follows: Me and my girlfriend booked a four nights stay in the beginning of April this year via hotels.com. I even made arrangements via email personally, and everything seemed fine. Until the morning after the cancelation deadline set by Hotels.com: At 7.41am (the deadline was midnight, 7,41 hours before the mail was sent) The hotel sent me an email stating that because of maintenance work taking place, they did not have a room for us, but no problem, they would like to offer us a room at their sister hotel. The trouble was that the sister hotel was in a different part of town, a part that we did not like to stay in. I politely declined the offer and canceled our booking directly with Pantheon Inn via email. Since it was less than 48 hours before our flight to Rome, I promptly booked another hotel of my own, naturally thinking that Pantheon Inn would accept my cancellation. Not so. They fairly quickly rang me and said they had a room after all! I had to tell them that I had canceled via email and that we had to book another hotel, without the possibility to cancel the new reservation. They then said I had to cancel via Hotels.com, something that was anything but straight forward, as we were past the cancellation deadline. Finally I got a cancellation confirmation from Hotels.com, but as this confirmation was not in place until the day before our arrival at Pantheon Inn, the Pantheon Inn chose to fully charge my credit card for the whole stay! I clearly did not accept this and expressed this clearly to the hotel directly via email, and also to Hotels.com, which I must say has been exceptional in their service trying to get Pantheon Inn to listen to reason. Not so, after a month of pestering Hotels.com, and in their turn Venere.com, all that Pantheon Inn could offer was a free 3 day stay at a later opportunity. Trouble is that we will never stay at this hotel, even for \"free\"! We have fortunatly found our hotel in Rome. It's close by and called the \"Albergo del Sole Al Pantheon\".

I received an email by return with confirmation that this had been actioned and the cost in euro's.

Behind a very understated green, large set of wooden doors, which led us up 2 flights of stairs we entered the entrance to the Pantheon Inn. With a warm welcome, Roberto showed us to our room. We had been lucky enough to have the room with the balcony. The room was very comfortable, clean & bright, with an en-suite bathroom (shower only no bath). Our room was right next to the breakfast room, in the mornings you can hear the creaking of the stairs as fellow holiday makers made their way to breakfast past your door. This by no means caused us any problems and was a great alarm clock for us to consider doing the same. The breakfast room was very welcoming, with tables set ready for you for breakfast. It was a self service basis, with an offering of pastries, cake, bread rolls, cheese, ham, coffee etc... I was celebrating my birthday during our visit and to my surprise they left a bottle of wine & 2 glasses in our room on my birthday, i was really touched and was impressed by their personal touch. Roberto and his team made us feel very welcome, providing us with a map and local information. The reception was manned 24 hours a day and they were always very willing to provide any assistance you may need or just pass the time of day.
