Perfect for us with 2 queen size beds and a sleep sofa. The beds were so comfortable and the sheets and bedspread so clean it was almost better than being at home! It had a full size fridge, sink, stove and even utensils, pots and pans, silverware, and even a dish towel and soap. It would be easy to cook a meal here (I forgot to mention a microwave and toaster). I'm sure there's more than is mentioned here. My favorite thing is that there's no \"motel smell\" which has been everywhere I've stayed at so far this summer. I've stayed in alot of places too with college visits, and then when we had no power for a week in the spring because of storms and Pepco (don't want to go there).

If you scroll through all the reviews you\u2019ll see mine where my chief complaint was a rather soft bed \u2026 otherwise it was perfect. Well, this year we had requested the same room as we had last year (111, in case you were wondering) because loved the location of it and also liked being on the first floor. With that being said, I want to admit that the bed was the same as last year and I slept like a baby! This hotel really is an astounding value for what you get. Our room once again had a the mini-kitchen (and I use the term \u201cmini\u201d lightly \u2013 it is actually quite spacious) and I think this year our room had received a new AC unit. We were there in the middle of one of the season\u2019s worst heatwaves and they were courteous enough to turn on the air conditioning in our room before we arrived! We brought our luggage into a freshly cooled room. The housekeeping staff meets and goes beyond all expectations. I\u2019ve stayed in quite a few hotels for work and I can truthfully say this is the cleanest property I\u2019ve had the pleasure of staying at. The office workers have been a pleasure to speak with both when making reservations and also checking in/out. There is plenty of well-lit parking with the spaces being very accommodating to bigger vehicles. That\u2019s not something you can say about other hotels/condos in the area. Additionally there is a new Grotto Pizza across the street complete with mini golf. It is nice to see that building back to life. Some folks have complained that ice is $1.50 a bag and that they do not supply complementary shampoo and other basic toiletries. Really? Is that really a deal breaker for you? First off, the ice is probably not complementary due to the motel\u2019s location \u2013 people walking to and from the beach would probably just take the ice as they wish. And I always take my own toiletries wherever I go. I prefer to use my own, thank you very much. They do supply hand/facial soap along with dish soap for the kitchen. If you can\u2019t stand forking over a measly buck fifty for a bag of ice that you can keep in your room\u2019s freezer or are very upset that you need to bring your own Prell then I guess you just can\u2019t be satisfied.

We planned a Labor Day vacation on a shoestring budget, however we didn't want to stay in a grimy dingy place in order to do so. Yes this is a MOTEL, but a very well kept motel. We were very pleased to find it was a 2 minute walk to the beach. The kitchen worked out great, although we did bring our over-sized electric griddle with us, to make sure all the kiddies had their pancakes at a reasonable hour. This was a big cost saver for us. Rather than eat out for every meal, we bought groceries for around $75 for a 5 day stay. Our only gripe was there was no coffee maker in the room! As avid coffee drinkers we were disappointed that we weren't able to just get up and put a pot on an sit out on the balcony. But we managed! Again it was very clean! And the service was great. We left for the beach every day and at one point I had to come back with my son who was in dire need of a nap. I was a little nervous because we had only been gone a little over an hour and we have definitely had hotels in the past where we've been gone 3 hrs and service STILL hasn't cleaned our room (and these were big fancy hotels too!) Well this wasn't the case. I walked up to my room and was releived to see the \"Please clean our room now\" sign was inside and our room had been taken care of. EVERY DAY they were on top of it. That was a big thing for us! Would we stay here again??? If the price was right, yes. We would like to check out some of the beach front vacation homes - the ones you don't find on Expedia, etc. as it was a little disappointing to watch from our balcony the busy traffic. But I would stay here over staying at the hotels overlooking the beach as we found those were way too expensive just for that option. Overall we were very pleased and their prices made this trip very reasonable for us. They were very clean and the staff was very friendly. I would highly recommend it over any of the other hotels in OC - unless you are looking to spend $300 a night :)", "Date": "September 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "central pa", "Title": "\u201cgreat place!!!! great price!!!!\u201d", "Author": "bar24", "ReviewID": "UR117798266", "Content": "My husband and I loved it here.

Motels usually translate to cheap accomodations in my mind, and from my experience. And given today's economy, I needed to save my money. So going on TripAdvisor experience, I booked a night here. It was well worth it! This motel is quite inexpensive (paid $75 for a 2 queen bed room WITH an extra sofa bed). It had a good kitchenette included (pots, pans, stove, microwave, fridge, etc.). Room was decent; comforters were a bit dated, but I wasn't expecting Marriott quality at that price point. It was clean, comfortable, safe. Proximity to the beach was awesome. It literally is a block away from the sand. And u don't cross any major streets. One residential block, and you're there. To top it off, the lady who booked us in gave my 2 kids 2 free beach pails & shovels. Excellent , friendly staff. I compared the price of the #2 hotel on TA, and that was like $300. The Seahawk's location is also very good for families. Since it is a bit north of the big big hotel properties with thousands of rooms, the area of the beach you are near is not as crowded, I believe, as the parts closer south to the Boardwalk. And driving from SeaHawk to the south area (Boardwalk area) was only a pleasant 10 min. drive down Coastal Highway. Without a doubt, if we go to OC again, we will book again with this well tended beach motel.

But all these worries went away as soon as we checked in and saw our room. We got a room that has the kitchenette for $131 a night right in the middle of the busiest part of the summer season. To get a room this close to the beach for that cheap seems unreal but the reviews are true. The kitchen is a 7/8 scale normal kitchen with a full size fridge. Definitely a good setup for saving money by having your own meals and snacks available in your room versus going out. We had a room with two double beds and a pull out sofa-bed. It was a very comfortable room and to say it was clean is an understatement. This place is honestly spotless, I've stayed in plenty of hotels for business and pleasure and this has to be the cleanest and most thorough maids I've experienced. There were plenty of towels available along with a nicely stocked kitchen. When we first arrived in our room we noticed two of the lamps had bulbs that had burned out. I had asked the front desk on our way out to dinner that evening if I could have 2 bulbs to replace the burned out ones. The guy at the front desk was extremely apologetic (practically falling over himself saying he was so sorry that wasn't noticed before we arrived) and put them in right then and there. He later checked to make sure everything was ok --- I haven't been treated this well in Hiltons or Wyndhams. The reviews were true about the shower temperature not staying constant but that's honestly not a huge deal to me. We had a room on the bottom floor right by the pool. We walked right out our sliding door into the pool each morning and enjoyed a nice, quiet and relaxing morning in the sun each day. Yes, its right off the main drag but its not that noisy. Plenty of parking and definitely family-friendly. Be sure to bring shampoo/conditioner/lotion. All they provide is hand soap. Also bring paper towels and/or old dish rags to do dishes. They provided one dish rag but it isn't enough to keep up (but that's just us) Pros: Price Price Price Price VERY roomy FREE High speed internet that's reliable and actually speedy Nice pool Kitchen Very clean Less than a 5 minute walk to the beach. Plenty of parking Cons: The beds are much too soft for anybody over 200 pounds, let alone 2 people. I actually slept on the sofa the one night due to being used to a firmer mattress. I can't believe somebody compared this place to a Hilton. You pay dirt cheap prices and get a ton. It isn't that modern looking but its clean. I didn't notice any sort of musty or mildew-y smell that some others had mentioned. Honestly, I'd rather stay here that a more-expensive hotel.

I shudder to think how much of my childhood money went to the amusement parks down by the pier. But as time passes more and more of the things I remembered are gone - the hotel I knew every square inch of - now towering condos. Enter the Sea Hawk...While located up in Northern OC beyond the Boardwalk's flashing lights and noise, it hits all the right notes for an OC hotel. Its close to the beach, the rooms are spacious and comfortable, it has a small pool for those times when you don't want to venture out on the sands but still want the sun and water. We stayed in one of the 4th floor motel rooms and therefore I can't comment on the efficiency rooms but I'm sure they're well suited to the task. After all, you shouldn't be trying to cook fancy meals at a beach hotel, you just need a fridge big enough to store drinks and milk for your cereal and perhaps some leftovers. If you're feeling very industrious you could throw some lunch meat and cheese in it for sandwiches as well. Even my room had a fridge large enough for all that. We also had two large beds, a good deal of space to toss our luggage around, a comfy sofa bed that could be closed off from the rest of the room with a folding screen, a nice large tv, wireless internet access which we were too tired to use the 1 night we were there, and a roomy balcony. The bathroom was reasonably spacious and clean, the air conditioning worked well. We didn't try the pool but it looked very inviting. The staff is also very friendly and helpful, as you would expect from a family-owned hotel. One thing for people to remember is - this is a vacation town. Yes, this hotel costs more then you would pay for the same type of hotel elsewhere. But its also 1/2 block to the beach in a town where you can pay several hundred dollars for a room that really doesn't offer much if anything more. Yes its a bit older, but its lovingly cared for.

I was impressed with its high ratings and affordable price. I didn't need luxury, but I wanted friendly service and a cozy, comfortable and CLEAN efficiency room in a non-smoking motel. The Sea Hawk turned out to be the perfect place. The kitchen had a full size refrigerator, microwave, apartment stove/oven and sink. It was equipped with a toaster, several sizes of pans for cooking, silverware, and dishes. You can request a coffee maker from the front desk (which we did). The room was large and had 2 queen beds and a double sofa bed. There was absolutely NO musty smell whatsoever, which really turns me off to a motel room (I even brought disinfectant and deodorizing spray with me just in case, but I had no reason to use it). I traveled with my husband and family (my kids are in their early 20s) and we all would stay there again in a heartbeat. I would advise bringing a mattress pad or perhaps a blow-up mattress if you plan to use the sofa bed though. My son slept on it and said it was uncomfortable (The mattress on it is very thin - nothing that we can't fix next time around.) I think you can request a rollaway bed also, so you might want to check into that option. The motel's location is fantastic. You don't have to cross the Coastal Highway to get to the beach, you can just walk through a parking lot and you're there! We liked that it was away from the noise of the boardwalk, and yet just a few minutes drive away. The beach was clean and the area was very family oriented. We also liked the fact that there is an outdoor shower so you can rinse the sand off before coming into the motel or before leaving the motel for home. They have a bathroom that you can use after you check out, so you can still enjoy the beach and have a place to shower and change before heading home from Ocean City. If you are looking for a 'home away from home' atmosphere, the Sea Hawk is just the place.

Our family planned our summer vacation at the last moment. My husband was doing a ton research for almost two days trying to find a last minute vacation spot for us (husband, wife, 5 year old boy). We had settled on renting a condo in Jersey (we live in Nyack, NY). But we still were not comfortable paying a large amount of money for staying somewhere for last than a week. So my husband decided to do some more searching and eventually his search paid off. He ended up reading some reviews on Ocean City, MD and how it can be an excellent trip for families and then he landed on trip advisor. Basically the rest was history. The sea hawk MOTEL was ranked #3 (and is still ranked #3) out of 103 places. We were amazed at that, the reviews are basically all positive, the price is unbelievable, you have an option of choosing a regular motel room or an efficiency (we chose the latter), AND the motel is on the ocean side (a 1/2 block away). We were sold!!! We had absolutely NO issues while staying there and we met a lot of lovely families that had made the motel there yearly family spot. The host was really nice and the cleaning ladies did an excellent job. Everything was super clean. We had a first floor room with a view of the strip and the pool to our right. We could be on the beach within 5 minutes. We could still enjoy a home cooked meal if we wanted to. And with a full sized refrigerator, options are endless. Drinks are always cold, we always had plenty of ice to pack the coolers, there's no limit on what you can make (food and drink wise:) and we always packed our lunches the night before we headed to the beach. A final reason why we chose this motel is because we did not want to be too close to the boardwalk. We felt that the closer that we would get to the boardwalk, the more of a chance we would be around loud neighbors. Which for some people, they would not mind. But since we have a little boy, that was important also.

Based on our experience, this past 4 nights, I dont think it belongs in the top 20. The low daily rate of $155 per night was the main draw admittedly, and the rooms were cleaned daily and the grounds were clean. This is a family run motel, and so the front office was friendly and helpful, but the rooms were small, outdated, the beds not firm enough for anyone over 200 lbs, the clientele sometimes not the best (our boogie board and beach chair were stolen from our front door overnight.), and our car was also keyed in the parking lot. I am not sure if this was just a random teenager or what, but in any case, this is not what I expect when I go on vacation to a nice hotel at the beach resort of Ocean CIty, MD. Let me say that in previous stays in Ocean CIty, that we stayed at the Hilton, whose rooms are almost brand new and three times the size of the Sea Hawk. Yes, the Hilton is more than three times the price of the Sea Hawk Motel, but is more than three times as nice as well in terms of size, view privacy and amenities. The Hilton is a hotel where you hate to leave. In contrast, we could not wait to check out of the Sea Hawk Hotel.. The Sea Hawk Hotel's only pool is adjacent to Coastal Highway and is really too small to be considered usable. In fact, its dimensions are no more than 20 x 30 feet. and 5 feet deep at the deep end. The Sea Hawk does have a 1.5 block walk to the beach at 125th st., but at least it is on oceanside. Also, the Sea Hawk does not have laundry facilities, so be prepared to use a laundromat, and bring your own toulet paper, paper towels, and can opener. The kitchen in the efficiency is rudimentary at best, and you will find yourself eating out almost every night., because the kitchen and related cooking equipment is not the same as what you are used to at home. On the plus side, the Sea Hawk is located across the street from a brand new all you can eat crab house, called Old Mill Crab House. Old MIll is expensive, but if you are hungry for blue crabs, you will enjoy the dinner. With the money you save by staying at the Sea Hawk you can definitely afford to eat out, so if you dont mind roughing it in an average non full service hotel, stay here at the Sea Hawk, and have extra money for eating out, or whatever else you like to do. If, on the other hand, you value quiet, privacy, ocean views, full service, no crime, safes in room, awesome pools, better location, but higher rates, stay at the Hilton.

I was pleasantly surprised to find the Sea Hawk with reasonable rates, and they didn't require a 3 night minimum like many others do during the summer. So after checking the reviews on this website, I decided to give it a try. Located down on 124th street it is away from all the hustle and bustle of the boardwalk, and still within a block to the beach. Mini golf, Sunsations, Dairy Queen, Dough Roller & Dump. Dairyland right across the street which is great since you don't have to hop in the car and drive. Make Note it's not a 5 Star Hotel, and if that is what you're looking for than this is not the place for you. We stayed on the 4th floor. Our room had 2 double beds, w/ a sleep sofa and mini fridge. The room was very clean, linens clean, and beds weren't too bad either (pretty bouncy and soft). I am a clean freak especially when it comes to the bathroom and it was definately up to standards. Be sure to bring your toiletries since they don't provide them. (except for a mini bar hand soap on the sink). They do however have hair dryers in the bathrooms which was a nice bonus. Aside from the room, the hotel has 1 elevator (kind of slow, but it works), and a small-medium size pool. Was cleaned each day we were there :) Overall - if you are looking for a clean, affordable room, close to beach without lots of added amenities, this will work for you.

You are less than a block from the beach, which is also very nice. If this is your first trip to OC, be aware that this hotel is on 124th St. Although you are on the coastal highway, you need to get in the car to do almost anything, except the beach and a few restaurants. It takes about 15 minutes by car (an hour if you take the bus) to get to the boardwalk. There are restaurants and attractions all over, however they are spread out.

There is also a small \"changing room\" which is actually a bathroom but without any hooks/holders for your dry/clean clothes.

Once I got over the shock that there is an 8 lane highway that is unavoidable in Ocean City and got used to the hassle of dealing with it, I started to appreciate the little things. Like what a good value this motel was, and how incredibly clean it is. In a nutshell, it is an old motel that is very well maintained. Nothing fancy, but the property has made the most of itself. It is freshly painted, the outdoor walkways were scrubbed by housekeeping, and planters with flowers were placed where there was room. There was no beach grunge in the rooms, carpets were clean, and so were the bedspreads!!!! Housekeeping seemed to wash these frequently as we saw them piled up in laundry carts. Our room had comfy beds, a mini kitchen complete with stove, microwave, fridge, cutlery, dishes, pots, pans, flyswatter, 2 queens and a separate sofa area that had a folding door that could be pulled across for a separate \"suite\" like effect when the kids were asleep, we could stay up. All for around $157 is a night in peak season. It was a block to the beach and you don't have to cross the highway like so many other hotels (watching families with toddlers and infants cross an 8 lane highway to get to the beach was a frequent sight, so if you stay, stay beachside! ) There is a small but clean and refreshing pool.

It was right outside the hotel office so it could be easily policed, but they closed at 8pm. Sometimes the kids wanted to swim at like 8:30 or 9pm and us parents wanted to sit around the pool and watch them and relax and we couldn't. Other than that, it was great!

This is definitely an older hotel but the owners and the staff have evident pride in the place and the management/staff are nice/friendly. The rooms are very, VERY clean. The bathroom was immaculate. I believe that the litmus test for hotel rooms is the shower curtain. At the bottom, inside edge of the shower curtain is where you can tell how much time the cleaning staff spends cleaning the room. This shower stall appeared NEW and the shower curtain was spotless! There were absolutely NO specks of dirt or cobwebs anywhere in that bathroom. We stayed on the 4th floor (room #450) and it appeared that the bathroom had been renovated (new \"bathfitter\" shower insert, new convex shower curtain rod and massager type shower head). Anyway, maybe we just lucked out and got a nice room. Another thing to note is that the bedspreads and bedding were quite nice. Pastel peach sheets (not the typical white), VERY clean and everyday when I saw the housekeepers they had a huge pile of clean bedspreads on a cart; they must wash the bedspreads on every check-out which I think is unusual for this \"class\" of hotel. Other noteworthy considerations: the hotel is only 1 & 1/2 SHORT blocks walk to the beach. They have complimentary coffee in the office. There is a \"Doughroller\" (pizza, pasta and breakfast) right across the street. There is a Dairy Queen right across the street. There is a 7-Eleven type store about 6 blocks away on the opposite side of the street.
