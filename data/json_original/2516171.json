However, once I entered my room I was delightfully pleased by the cozy decor, the little fireplace, the convenient kitchenette, and the spacious bathroom equipped with a jacuzzi for two. The bathroom amenities were classy and high quality, and the bed and linens were cozy in our room. The spa prices were also surprisingly affordable, as was the price of our room. And I liked the nice detail of cookies and apple cider left out for the guests in the afternoon, and the sensible, yet quality breakfast assortment, which even included hard boiled eggs, which isn't usually common in \"continental breakfast\" assortments at other similarly-priced places. Now the downsides. The TV set in the room was old and the color looked ugly (and the remote control only allowed for switching channels and navigating Comcast, not brightness settings, etc.) I also felt the outdoor pool and jacuzzi left something to be desired. Considering the area and its proliferation of natural hot springs, it would have been nice to have had access to a natural mineral pool, not just a tiny little chlorinated jacuzzi. Also, Wi-Fi signal in our room was barely there, and we were not able to connect to the Internet at all through it, neither on my laptop or Nook. This was a big downside, since my husband had to get in touch with his work colleagues and was not able to. On a personal note, I was also a little personally miffed that at checkout time the desk clerk, seemed to have assumed that I was a cleaning lady (perhaps because I have dark hair and look very Hispanic???) and she was a little off-putting when I initially engaged with her, asking me if I had already spoken to some other Hispanic-named woman (an employee, I am guessing?). Since there were other customers at the front desk at the same time, she approached me as if whisking me off so that they wouldn't see me. Only then did I say, \"umm, I'm here to check out???\" I was a little offended by that encounter, but oh well, maybe I do look like someone who works there!

We were greeted by a very friendly young man who told us about the property, our room, breakfast, tea, the hot tub, spa, etc. He was very helpful and so refreshingly nice! There were fresh, warm cookies, coffee and tea available at night as well. The room was nice, well sized and had efficient amenities. The little gas fireplace made the room very cozy. We also liked the small kitchen space with sink, refrigerator and microwave. The bathroom was clean and practical. Nothing fancy but the bathtub was deep enough to soak. In the morning they had a nice layout or fresh fruit, hard-boiled eggs, rolls, bread and croissants. There was great hot coffee and a nice assortment of teas. The fireplace in the outdoor breakfast area was also going and made the winter morning very pleasant and enjoyable. The only complaint I had was that the pool was not heated nearly warm enough to get into on a cool winter evening. That is one of the joys of Calistoga hot spring hotels is that you can float around and soak in a nice warm swimming pool...that was a bit disappointing. The hot tub was hot but the surface was very rough and scratchy. It was rough enough to snag your swimming suit so beware of that if you have a nice, delicate suit and do not want it to get ruined on a rough surface. The motel is within easy walking distance to all restaurants and shops in downtown Calistoga. Overall a great experience!

Over the holidays a few family members and I booked rooms here for a mini-getaway and it was just as great as I remember it from a few years ago. First of all, I grew up in the Napa Valley so I know Calistoga pretty well. I also know how expensive hotels can be (all over the valley, not just Calistoga!). I feel like you can't really beat the EuroSpa and Inn price-wise, especially for what you get. The location: fantastic, just a block or so off the main drag. It's quiet and feels remote, although you are a quick walk away from restaurants and spas. Ambiance: EuroSpa feels kind of like a retro motor-lodge to me...small, you can park right up by your room, but it's very cute and quaint. The rooms are cozy...HUGE WHIRLPOOL TUBS are seriously amazing, and you get a fireplace in your room! If you are expecting fancy or super modern, this is not it. If you like cozy and little rustic, you've come to the right place! Service: the people who work here are really friendly and nice. The included morning breakfast is fantastic; you MUST try the house-made granola! Coffee, fruit, bagels, hard boiled eggs, cereal, yogurt, etc. etc. all provided as well. In the afternoons they have little nibbles like cookies along with apple cider...very cute! The \"breakfast\" area is a cute outdoor patio with a nice firepit...or, if you are antisocial you can take a tray back to your room! Things I Can't Personally Vouch For: spa and pool. I've always come for quick winter trips so I haven't had a chance to try out their pool or indulge at their spa, but they both look good to me. Why I Gave them 4 Stars and not 5: no mineral pools! Lots of other hotels in the area offer mineral pools, but EuroSpa doesn't have one. It's not a huge deal, as you can easily visit neighboring hotels and spas and get a mineral pool daypass, but it would be nice to have one at EuroSpa as well.

He ended up charging me for a QQ even though I had checked into a single. (warning the QQ is a dark room off the owner's house, I switched to a single king when I saw how dark it was and how it was almost part of the front desk).

This is the reason for docking 2 stars - otherwise, we'd give this place 4 stars overall. I'm glad we scheduled the spa session on our last day because it came in handy to work out the knots from the bed. 2. Lack of power plugs - especially near the one table in the room. We lucked out and the office staff had a spare extension cord we could borrow for our laptop. We would consider staying again as we thought EuroSpa place had better/cuter renovations than other similarly priced hotels in the area but not until the uncomfortable beds are replaced. The pool/jacuzzi area was really well renovated (new furniture and cabana) but not every guest will use those amenities. Every guest will use the bed!

We stayed here for a night, because the owner's other property, Stevenson Manor didn't have any vacancy on the Friday of our 3 night stay in Calistoga. All I can say is that this quaint spot more than held its own. The room while a bit tight, surprisingly accommodated our son's pack-n-play as well as the rollaway bed the staff brought in for our daughter. It was very clean and had some nice additions like a wet bar, small refrigerator, and microwave. One red mark on the room was the towel rack, which fell off when I first reached for a towel. Yet, after a call to the front desk it was fixed within 15 minutes. The grounds at first glance seem compact, but really were quite comfortable. With a small sitting area on the deck in front of our room, a rose garden with Adirondack chairs to relax, and pool with grassy areas on either side of it the kids were able to move around and keep interested. Not only was it more than enough for my little ones, but also for what I believe were 3 other families with small children there that day. The covered outdoor eating area for the continental breakfast as well as afternoon snacks was a nice touch and something enjoyed by the whole family. At a lower price than many places in Calistoga, I think that Eurospa falls into the category of hidden gem.

Wireless internet was also available free of charge, you just had to get your user ID and password from the front desk when you check in. The location is also a plus. If you've come for the wine tasting you're within a few miles of some good ones. Schramsberg, Bennett Lane, Chateau Montelena and Frank Family to name a few. If you'd prefer to hoof it, downtown is just a few blocks away. We walked to dinner at BarVino which is a tapas restaurant on Lincoln Ave. Besides featuring great food they offer wines by small local vineyards that you would have trouble finding anywhere else. You can buy them by the bottle, glass or 2 oz sampler pour which is nice as it allows you to sample several different wines. And if you happen to really like one they'll sell you a bottle to take home at a discounted retail price. If at this point you're getting a little tired of wine and are craving a beer you'll pass right by the Calistoga Restaurant & Brewery on your walk back to the EuroSpa. If you like to hike, Mt St Helena, a 4,400 gem is just a few miles away. Our original plan included taking time to do this 5 mile hike but the weather was a little sketchy. Breakfast is included and was fine. It consisted of hard boiled eggs, bagels, breads, muffins, cereal, coffee and juices and is served outdoors on the patio. Sit near the fire pit if it's a chilly morning. Overall we enjoyed our stay here and would highly recommend it to travelers looking for nice accommodations in a great location.", "Date": "March 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cExcellent value for girls' weekend\u201d", "Author": "rbuffing", "ReviewID": "UR6851655", "Content": "My 2 friends and I stayed in the 2-room King suite for a 2-night stay.

The rooms surround the parking lot (not a glamorous effect), but the buildings' exteriors were immaculate. The pool area would benefit from a new, taller fence - the residential neighbors' junky yards were in full view. But the pool and hot tub looked newly-renovated. Hot tub was good 'n hot. We all three indulged in spa services (massage, salt-scrub, facial) and were very satisfied with those as well. The spa manager was especially pleasant and helpful. We did not try the afternoon snacks, but the continental breakfast offered many choices, the food was fresh and tasty, and the outdoor patio was very pleasant. It is a short two-block walk to Calistoga's main drag and we enjoyed walking to dinner and shopping. Eurospa's location in a residential neighborhood prevented us from having to listen to traffic noise. That's a real advantage as a lot of the other Calistoga hotels seem to be right on the main street. This place has everything you need, and no glaring faults.

We four gal-pals stayed 2 nights at the EuroSpa & Inn in Calistoga (north Napa), a small place just off the main Napa thoroughfare (Rt. 29). After spending a day in Sonoma stopping at various wineries (Castle, Imagery, Arrowwood, Cohn) along Rt. 12, we crossed over to Calistoga via Calistoga and Petrified Forest Roads. The hotel reminded us of motels from childhood days -- single story buildings with outdoor entrances that open into the parking lot. About 15 or so rooms, total. There is a nice little pool out back, fenced in, with views of the nearby grape fields and the mountains in the distance. Outside the registration office is a covered area where (free!) breakfast is served from 8 - 10am, with cereals, fruit, rolls, yogurt, hardboiled eggs, juice, milk, coffee and tea -- something for everyone. We timed our visit for possibly the hottest weather in history -- daytime temps of 110 degrees -- but in cooler weather, there is a sweet little outdoor fireplace in the breakfast area. Fortunately, the temperatures would abate overnight so that al fresco dining in the morning was very pleasant. We were able to book the suite, which is two bedrooms -- a main bedroom area with a King bed that includes a small dining table, tv, sink and fridge, along with a smaller bedroom with a Queen bed, and a spacious bathroom. Four women stayed comfortably here. Our room was at the end of one of the building units, next door to the day spa, and backs up to the fenced-in pool area, so we had complete privacy. It almost felt more like our own little cottage. We had booked one-hour massages at the adjacent spa, and they were able to handle all four of us simultaneously. Robes were provided in the room, so we just walked next door in our robes for our appointment. (The spa is under new management, and one of the two new owners -- previously of Auberge du Soleil -- greeted us and made us feel very welcome.) This is not a luxury spa, but is clean, bright, nicely staffed, and met our needs. The EuroSpa is two short blocks off of Lincoln, the main road through Calistoga for shopping and dining. It's very walkable, but if you must drive, there is ample parking in the downtown area. The hotel manager, Bill, is helpful, warm and funny. In addition to helping me re-book our reservations after unexpectedly having to postpone our trip in April, he suggested the suite arrangement for the four of us as well as a spa package that included the one-hour masages. All told, we each paid approximately $200 for two nights lodging AND the massage (plus breakfast each morning). He immediately fixed an airconditioning 'problem' (pilot error on our part), gave us coupons for some of the Napa wineries, tips on where to eat, and made a dinner reservation for us. Thanks, Bill. While time didn't allow us to explore north of Calistoga, we did visit several wineries south of there, including Cakebread (delightful in all ways), Ehlers (charming), Rutherford (nice, but would only go if you're visiting Auberge du Soleil), Mondavi (A+ for the scenery but the unfriendly gentleman overseeing our tasting experience Sunday morning was a bummer) and V. Sattui (super crowded, almost frenzied feel to the place on the Sunday we stopped by), plus visits to Auberge du Soleil for lunch (beautiful, expensive food, incredible service and gorgeous views) and the Culinary Institute of America at Greystone for shopping (just the Greystone building alone is worth a stop).

We finally settled on the Eurospa Inn & went with one of their larger rooms. The hotel is a block off the main Calistoga strip and is set up with cottages in a horseshoe shape around the parking lot. Our room had a king-sized bed in the living room and a small extra bedroom with a queen-sized bed. The bathroom had both a shower and a big jacuzzi bath tub. It had a cable tv, a small fridge and a small fireplace, along with a little table & chairs. The complimentary robes & pool towels they provided were also great.

When one thinks of \"EuroSpa\" (whatever that might me!) Motel 6 does not come to mind. All of the rooms (of which there are maybe 10 or so) face the middle parking lot. None of them even have windows facing the hills or anything other than a big slab of pavement and cars. The spa was nothing to write home about. The pool was extremely uninviting. The room was dark, with pretty bad lighting. However, that being said, the people were very nice. My massage was great (my wife's was pretty bad, apparently).

The place is in a neighborhood setting and backs up to vineyards. While it has a bit of a mini-motel court feel, everything is freshly painted, decked and clean. There's an outdoor breakfast and socializing area that boasts a wood stove for chilly mornings where a nice continental breakfast is served. This area is also a hub for afternoon \"snacks\" (cookies, savory snacks and sparkling cider). While our double room really had no view, it was very large with a wood burning stove, an entryway sitting alcove, TV, wetbar and a big bathroom with shower and a luxury whirlpool bathtub that could truly accommodate two full grown adults.
