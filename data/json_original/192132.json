I booked our room at the Gainsborough Hotel through Late Rooms for \u00c2\u00a389. I was quite happy with this, especially considering it was meant to be a four star hotel... And then I read the reviews! Well, after staying for only one night (on a Saturday), I can safely say that most of my fears were unfounded, and our stay was pleasant, barring a strange wake up call. Reception was well decorated and we felt very under-dressed in jeans and t-shirts! We were greeted by a friendly woman at the counter who gave me the appropriate paperwork before the manager came and finished checking us in. I have read many things about staff speaking sub-par English, and while it wasn't perfect, I could easily understand what they were saying and so check-in went smoothly. The first lady to greet us showed us to our room which was number 23 in the basement. I was a bit frightened by the prospect of a basement room, after the reviews I had read; however, we were pleasantly surprised. The room was well decorated, and besides a little peeled wallpaper by the window and some stains on the bathroom floor, it wasn't anything like the horror stories painted by the reviews I had read. The room was situated with its windows facing up into the street. Besides a few loud groups of people who passed while we were resting, the noise level was tolerable. The strangest thing about our stay happened in the night. I was woken up at around 3:30 in the morning by my husband, who was in a bit of a panic after a loud alarm had woken him up. I had heard it in my dreams and didn't think much of it; however, my husband was deeply disturbed for at least an hour, thinking there might have been a fire or something similar. I should also add that it was about this time that we heard loud music begin to play, as has been mentioned before in many reviews. Perhaps it was because of how close to the street we were, but the music was no where near loud enough to disturb us and so we eventually fell back to sleep. It is a very convenient location, with the National History Museum within a two minute walk of the hotel. If you can book through a discount travel agent, then I'd recommend it for a convenient alternative to the more expensive hotels around. I would say that for the price we paid at such short notice, we received our money's worth; however, I would definitely go with caution as I'm sure not everyone will be as lucky as we were.", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201creview Gainsborough hotel very poor\u201d", "Author": "shane b", "ReviewID": "UR118139626", "Content": "this is not a luxury boutique hotel.

The service on check in was good - there was another guest at the desk as we arrived so were shown to some seats and within a few minutes were checking in. Went up to our triple room (1 double and 2 singles) which was clean and well presented. The room was a nice size, and could be partitioned off into two separate bedrooms which was useful. The only thing that was lacking in the room itself was tea and coffee making facilities, but there was room service so that really wasn't a problem. Aside from this, the only actual issue we had was that the shower wasn't all that good, it did work - just wasn't ideal. As mentioned in a previous review, there is a nightclub close to the hotel, and yes, there was some noise from it, but to be frank it really wasn't enough to keep any of us awake - light sleepers included. Probably worth bearing in mind that we stayed on a Saturday night, I'm guessing the club wouldn't be open every night in the week. We knew we'd be returning to the hotel late, so were concerned about the distance between the hotel and the nearest tube (South Kensington). It was literally 5 minutes walk, not a problem at all. The breakfast in the morning was great, either full English or Continental. All your usual juices, cereals, rolls, crossiants, fruit etc etc. I think the breakfast was available until 11.00am. Checked out of The Gainsborough at around 11.00am and left our luggage behind reception until 7.00pm that night - was great and so convenient as we didn't want to have to carry our bags around the capital all day!! Thought it may be useful to add this to the review: To get to the hotel from the tube station, head up Harrington Road, and Queensberry Place is the second road on the right (turn at the French bookshop) - the hotel itself is about half way along, also on the right.

There is a club DIRECTLY underneath the hotel. If you are going to be there over the weekend bring ear plugs. We had the pleasure of experiencing this club until 4am on New Year's Eve.

Secondly, you have to go into a discount hotel in London knowing what to expect, e.g. tiny rooms and limited amenities. That said, the staff was friendly and courteous across the board. I was unhappy with other reviews stating that English was not the native language of the staff. That had absolutely no bearing and every single member of the staff extended courteous greetings from check-in to check-out. I stayed in room 401, a single overlooking the French school. There was a bit of noise from the other rooms, that you will find in any converted Eduardian hotel. I had to go to both Holborn and Olympia, so the hotel was ideally located 5 minute walk from South Kensington station. For tourists, the V&A and Natural History museums are only a few minutes walk. Other reviews noted the noise from the disco. I was there Sun-Thur nights so I can't comment on that. I confess to staying at the airport on Fri night just in case noise was a problem. The bathroom was bigger than some other rroms I have had, and there was no problem with hot water (albeit one morning where I had to leave at 4 am to catch an early flight. The plumbing is old and takes a long time to get the pipes heated). The room was a bit chilly, but there was a perfectly adequate electric heater in the room. My only small issue was that the bed was a bit beaten and slightly sagging in the middle. But I have had much worse.

They had booked the hotel via a less discriminating website on the basis that it was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153short walk\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the Royal Albert Hall. The obligatory Eastern European receptionist informed me that despite the booking reference I had been given and a copy of the email including the credit card booking, I would have to pay for the room myself. Given the hour and the fact that I had to prepare for dinner, in typically English fashion I surrendered my credit card for the sake of convenience. So to the room, 108, which had previously been a room but was now an abbreviated room. I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blame the current proprietors for this architectural vandalism because it was once the fashion to take huge Georgian town houses and turn them into hotels by chucking up a few dividing walls. Suffice to say that the largest dimension in room 108 is from floor to ceiling. The room is a bit dingy too being illuminated by a chandelier with six, energy saving, 5 watt bulbs. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit like a winter skyline at dusk, objects in different shades of grey. The window faces the street and features French doors opening inwards allowing access to a narrow balcony, shared with other rooms. The balcony is not safe and the hardware on the windows is insecure meaning anyone with access to the other rooms could easily get into 108 too. Another safety issue is the use of trailing sockets for the TV and lighting. There were two full gangs next to the TV, which surely can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been passed by a fire inspector? The en-suite bathroom occupied a large corner of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153semi-room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but was cleverly designed in such a way that there was no shelf space for wash bags. The mixer-tap shower is best used \u00e2\u20ac\u0153off peak\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd unless you are of a Scandinavian persuasion and enjoy alternative scalding and freezing. Also, while you are standing in the bath taking a shower you can appreciate the local culture because there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty in the soap dish and on the tiles. I am 6\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 1\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and not exactly a fluke of nature but the abbreviated room also had an abbreviated bed. Only by discarding the many pillows and cushions could I lie down there to discover that the bed, though on the firm side, was fantastic. Yep, I could have slept like a baby in that bed if it hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been for the bloke in the room above erecting a shed though I accept that he might have just been walking to the loo across the somewhat irregular wooden floors in the Gainsborough. Before Dinner, I met with a friend and upon asking at the Reception where the bar was, the Receptionist pointed to the corner of the Reception where there was a shelf and a fridge. Think Vera Duckworth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bar in her house on Coronation Street. A member of staff was summoned to administer to our needs and we were shown the drinks list. Virtually none of the wine or other drinks was available so we opted for what we could see - a Vodka & Tonic and a bottle of Stella Artois. My friend had the last of the Vodka. Standing on the shelf, sorry \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bar\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, was a half empty jug of Iced Tea (Paradoxically NOT on the drinks list) and someone had removed three lemon slices and placed it on a side plate. When my friend was asked if she wanted ice and lemon, the chap took the tongs, took the ice from the ice bucket and then used the tongs to pick up a slice of lemon from beside the iced tea. I did a double take thinking maybe it was the lemon for the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bar\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. My friend hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t said anything so neither did I but when we both sat down we realized we had both clocked it and had a good laugh at our \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fawlty Towers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd moment. You couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make it up. In conclusion, as others have said, the location of the Gainsborough is excellent for South Kensington and it is on a quiet street. Fact is, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the worst hotel I have stayed in but when you factor in the high room rate, the small dingy room and the absence of any apparent customer care why would you want to stay here?", "Date": "July 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cHorrible Experience\u201d", "Author": "hennessiee", "ReviewID": "UR13999730", "Content": "This hotel was terrible.

They offered us complimentary hot drinks (tea) even before asking for our names. Perky and friendly butlers helped us carry our suitcases into our rooms. They mobbed my youngest daughter and played with her a little whilst we were sipping on our teas. Breakfast was likewise superb. The food was well-presented and varied. I even had to ask the recipe of herbed butter as it was so lovely to spread on a hot toast. The hotel did not offer any meal except breakfast but there was a 24-hour room service to compensate that and the entire South Kensington area is surrounded by all sorts of restaurant anyway so eating out was not an issue with us.
