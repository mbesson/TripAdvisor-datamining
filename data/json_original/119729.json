I was in town visiting friends. Since the residences in SD are super tiny I just wanted my own place to shower and sleep. Check in was easy. The guy at the front desk was very nice. I pulled up to my room to find a truck full of guys sitting outside smoking and drinking, who were staying in the room next door to mine, I promptly went back to the front desk and asked for another room which was no problem, however it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that far away from the first room. If I had been traveling with my boyfriend we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have made it 5 minutes in this place. My room was the second most run down hotel room I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever stayed at. As soon as I walked in and put my stuff down I was on the phone trying to meet up with my friends ASAP. I also stayed out as late as possible so I would be too tired to care what I was coming back too. The bed was fine but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m glad I brought extra pillows. The location is great as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close to everything! I felt perfectly safe. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not a person who cares about d\u00c3\u00a9cor or other miniscule flaws; however, I do care about patches of black mold spores covering the bathroom ceiling, particularly when that ceiling is only about 6 feet tall. For some reason the ceiling in the shower is substantially shorter than the rest of the bathroom. My bf who is 6\u00e2\u20ac\u21224\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have fit in there. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m 5\u00e2\u20ac\u21226\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the water hit me at my belly button I had to get on my knees to wash my hair. I also would have to shut the water off mid shower to let the tub drain. Also, if you are staying by yourself don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t close the bathroom door all the way when you take a shower because the door tends to swell shut and you might get stuck in there for a little while :-/ I was also bit by ants while using the restroom. On my first morning I was awoken at 6:30 am to what I thought was an earthquake. The building was cracking, having lived in SD for 3 years I know what it sounds like, however, it turned out just to be the people above me. You can hear every footstep, when the shower comes on, when the dresser doors open, when the front door closes, and when housekeeping is vacuuming. My bf has worked at a hotel front desk for years and when a hotel is half empty, like this one was, he never puts people on top of each other or right next to each other, why \u00e2\u20ac\u201c because of all the complaints. I do not understand the logic behind cramming everyone next to each other for no apparent reason it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extremely inconsiderate. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m on vacation I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to have to wake up when my neighbors wake up. The second morning I woke up to the same scenario but then about 8 am my air conditioner started making a horrible noise. It sounded like someone was in the vent banging on it with a hammer. I shut it off for an hour and tried again but it was still making the noise, and then waited another hour but no such luck. So I called the front desk and asked if I could change rooms, preferably upstairs. This was no problem someone ran over and brought me a key to a room upstairs within minutes. They even offered to help me with my bags (FYI there is no elevator). When I got to the new room it was like I was at a totally different hotel. It was in far better shape than the one downstairs. The shower was clean and the tub drained quickly, but this could be due to the fact that the water coming out of the shower head in this room only came out like a slow drip. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re talking zero water pressure. Although I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to worry about people pounding around on the ceiling, I had the most obnoxious neighbors on both sides of me. The one to the left kept their front door open with the TV blaring all evening. When the door was shut, they came in and out every 15 minutes to smoke. I could hear every word of every conversation on both sides of me. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wake up to the sounds of the building cracking my third morning just the sounds of vacuum cleaners. When housekeeping is in your neighbors room it sounds like they are in your room. The air conditioner started making the same noise as before around 9 am. So in conclusion, if you end up staying here and have any problems the staff will work with you to solve them, but how many times do you want to do that? If they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cram their guests together when they had the space to scatter them, they would get at least 1 extra star probably even 2 because I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have had half the problems that I did. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re hard of hearing and like to wake up at the crack of dawn then this is the place for you. If however you have the hearing of a dog and like to sleep in until there is at least double digits on the clock then I suggest you go elsewhere.

The pool which is supposedly located in the palm tree filled courtyard is actually situated nicely between a large area of parking lot and the nearest highway. You may be a little late to the pool if you are busy sleeping in on the hard beds. I realize that this may be hard to do though, if you bed is shaking at 7 am in the morning because of the jackhammers at the large construction site next door, or if the hotel maintenance decides that trimming the bushes at 8 am is a good idea as well. Top this off with unresponsive staff who would not bring us toilet paper because they didn't want to leave the office at the hour of 11 pm and the on-site American style restaraunt that cost us just over $30.00 for 4 of us to have scrambled eggs and toast! I would highly recommend that you find another location for your vacation. If perhaps the other prices are too much for you, which is understandable, then I heard that Florida is a nice place to go!", "Date": "July 24, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWould never stay here again\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2149360", "Content": "I would never stay here again.
