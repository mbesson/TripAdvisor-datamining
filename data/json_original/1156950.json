The rooms were nice in general, very clean and tidy. I stayed in a smoking room on a smoking floor because one of the high schoolers was allergic and had to switch with me, but it wasn't too bad. The stove tops work decent (but you typically have to turn them down lower than you would think), the fridge was great, and the beds were pretty comfortable. This place was pretty full, and so it was pretty noisy with some unwieldy high school groups and some drunk construction workers. If you can't handle smoke, stay out of the top floor.

I saw some people waiting at the desk, for awhile, but then left out of frustration. The maintenance guy looked really ragged with his stained Suburban Extended Stay shirt.

This hotel is one of the best. Again my stay was one month. The rooms and buildings are extremely clean and well kept. The service is great. Anytime I needed my room cleaned it was cleaned. The area is very nice with sushi, thai, american, mexican restaurants within 1 mile. A gym within 2-3 miles that is free for guests. There are 2 malls and a movie theatre with 3-4 miles as well. A trader joes and grocery store within 3 miles. Everything you need or want.

Overall I enjoyed my stay though I did expect a little more being that the hotel is a Choice Hotels Platinum award winner. If you have never stayed at a Suburban before then this is Choice Hotels budget, extended stay type lodging similar to a Candlewood or Towneplace Suites. Its pretty much a no frills place and the rooms have full kitchens complete with full sized fridge, microwave, 2 burner cook top and dishwasher. The room itself and the bathrooms are smallish but not completely claustrophobic, though you could start bouncing off the walls if your there for more then a couple of weeks I'd imagine. The one thing that really stinks with these hotels in the lighting, the rooms are dark and dreary almost like a cave,why they didn't put better lighting in the design of these hotels, especially considering they get a lot of business travelers, I'll never understand. This is the second Suburban I've stayed at and while not as nice as the first one it was still pretty solid and a good value. The main issues I had were: A: Housekeeping, the housekeeping was subpar, my bathroom had a lot of pubic hair that had not been cleaned up. B: Ants, we couldn't leave any food sitting open on the counter, table, etc or it would be covered in ants in no time. C: Internet speed, the hotel has wired and wireless Internet and while it worked pretty decent the speeds themselves were lousy and incapable of streaming video. The Suburban in Lenxa, KS gives you like 10 Mbps downloads this hotel you get maybe .50 Mbps at best which is pretty awful. You also have to consider this hotel gets very full during the week so that's a lot of people sharing the measly bandwidth. D: Noise, the walls are thin and I was between a howling dog in one room and in the other room was a a guy who was coughing, hacking and spitting 24/7, I found the dogs howling to be more tolerable. Another minor issue I had was with check in. Be prepared to be asked a LOT of questions, why your in town, what company your with, what you do, etc, etc the questions in my opinion went way beyond just small talk and were more like an interrogation of sorts. When your tired after a long day of driving all you want to do is check in and not get hammered with a battery of questions. Other then that my stay was pretty good and at less then $60 a night I thought it was a good deal as well. I loved the hotel location, its at a pretty busy exit with lots of businesses within a close distance. Would I stay there again? Yes, but I might check the price of the Candlewood Suites next door first and if it was a better value I'd probably stay there instead. The Suburban gets very full during the week with construction workers and parking can be a problem but the Candlewood seemed to have plenty of parking available. In fact if you check in late you might find yourself having to park at the Candlewood anyway as there will be no spots available. Ultimately this is a solid hotel but certainly no Platinum Award winner in my opinion.", "Date": "July 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fishers, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cNew hotel great for multi-week stay situations\u201d", "Author": "mabradford14", "ReviewID": "UR45493721", "Content": "I recently sold my home and needed a place for 2-3 weeks until the new home I purchased was ready.

Very helpful and friendly staff. Great empty lots nearby to walk and play with your pet if you have one. You know what you are getting- a one room studio equipped with everything you need except a stove; it's convenient to Castleton shopping and dining.
