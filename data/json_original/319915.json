He took us up to the room, showed us around and showed me how the safe worked. We thanked him and he left. There was a welcome pack there for us A/C was going etc, very very nice indeed. We were located on the 23rd floor with great views of the city.The property was superbly presented with plenty of fresh towels, etc. Free breakfast was inclusive, not a big selection, but enough to get you on the go for the day.The staff were very helpful and very friendly and were more than happy to go out of their way to help.There was a taxi stand just outside the door with Orchard road just a 2 minute walk, Somerset MRT about 5/10 min walk. Great property and great Location!", "Date": "Oct 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR562025974", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "spe18z"}, {"Content": "Very disapointing and over priced! I expected much better from a chain that advertise on being the top of the top for the business travelers!The price is definitely on the top: 8000S$ (5000USD) for a 2BR. Unfortunately the rest is a let down:- Cheap furnitures,- Cheap linen,- 2nd bedroom with only a single bed- Some cockroaches in the kitchen with a strong musty smell,- Under standard appliances (small TV, noisy ref).- Very common breakfast (cheap cereals, scrambled eggs, bread, tea  coffee, that's all).- Small swimming pool, etc.The worst is that despite the hefty price it's not all included and some basics come as add-on:- Internet is not free (100S$/month and only 512Kbs bandwidth),- Cable TV doesn't include some basic channels (eg nothing for the kids),- Utilities is included only up to 250S$/month. And with 33\u63b3C electricity for aircon will easily get you above it.So all together, I've been very disappointed and will avoid Somerset in the future!", "Date": "Apr 23, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR447550674", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "TravelerInAsia"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d319915-r12128133-Somerset_Grand_Cairnhill-Singapore.html", "HotelID": "319915", "Price": "$440"}}
