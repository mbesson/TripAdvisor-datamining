{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Close to rail station We stayed at this hotel a week ago. We had room no. 26. which was a huge room with a balcony but very dark room. We entered at night and I wanted to leave just then. One of the 3 lights with very voltage bulbs was not working. I pointed this out but they never took care of that. The hotel staff is helpful but there were a few who did not understand english very well. Breakfast i thought was below average. Rolls, cheese, ham, yogurt, canned fruit. Rolls did not seem fresh. Coffee was good. There was no decor in the room. very oldish. I passed some of the other rooms and the flooring and walls seemed much better. the view from the balcony was the building next door. The hotel very close to train station, so very conveient, if you want to travel outside of Florence. If you want to enjoy florence then stay next to the bridge, everything is pretty much there. However Florence is small and you can walk to your destination. There are more hotels close by to the train station. The bathroom was nice and new.Would not stay here again.", "Date": "Oct 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR989107316", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "manras"}, {"Content": "lovely       hotel entrance", "Date": "Oct 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR568859926", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "hapagirl_italy"}, {"Content": "Okay for the price, but ... This is a budget hotel located near the train station and bus depot. I stayed here during the height of tourist season and appreciated the well-priced, clean room and the decent breakfast. My room faced an interior air shaft. At first, I was sorry not to have a view. But on the other hand, I had no street noise. The room was tiny, but clean. The bathroom could pose a problem for some, as the slate floor gets very slippery. Too few towels were provided.Most of the staff was pleasant and polite - except for the infamous breakfast lady with whom several in my group had run-ins. As for me, she ran after me to the elevator yelling that I was not supposed to take more than one paper napkin. (I had taken five.)We were suspicious when the hotel staff recommended the restaurant next door (The Two Gs), wondering if it was perhaps run by the owner's brother-in-law. It turned out to serve wonderful, authentic food.", "Date": "Jul 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR197691669", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "fishbone96"}, {"Content": "Be careful about the noise We had to change the room because of the street noise. The first room we got was really small, noisy and ugly. Every single wall (and ceiling) was green painted... The second one was much better and we could sleep quite well. The breakfast was just OK, nothing special. The hotel is very near the train station and we could find some very good and not expensive restaurants nearby. I do recommend a trattoria called Enzo  Piero, don't leave Florence without eating their panna cotta!!!! It's simply the best!!!!!!", "Date": "Jun 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR278324914", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Youngcouple2007"}, {"Content": "too bad to be true! My company booked a single room and when I arrived to the hotel they first gave me a a very small and really noisy room (ground floor).Then I complained and they gave me an also small and smelly one! Two blankets so old and dirty that I could not believe how is it possible. When I complaned about the smell they said that the problem is that people smoke in the rooms. But that's not the type of smell that I am talking about... But even if that was the problem it is definately not my problem.Then, the electric power: They have no plugs adapted to laptops (despite the fact that they have wifi...), so I complained. They finnally gave me an adapter... At least a problem solved!The hotel was renovated and it is central. But I would not recommend it.

Water pressure was great and it was clean. Our room was next to the lift, and the 1st night was pretty noisy but seemed to be ok after that. Staff were friendly and helpful.
