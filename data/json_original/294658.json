The rooms we had were nice - having seen other reports we were worried about them being dated, but certainly on the executive floors they were clean and as expected for this standard of hotel. The bathrooms were small and had no separate shower but were acceptable with nice toiletries, the same we had in the Conrad Singapore on our last stay. The executive lounge was well stocked and again the staff were pleasant, it had a nice terrace you could sit out on with great views which made it extra special. Breakfast on the 14th floor was good and had a varied selection with all of it being good quality. This too had a terrace which was nice to sit out on and start the day.

Installations are a bit dated, shower only works full power, american style. Toilet flush on the other hand tries to save water, meaning you may have to press it several times... Another issue: you definitely hear it if your neighbor takes a shower. Economy internet, included in my corporate rate, has a data limit! Be careful when composing a long email on a webmail server - all typing might be lost if you hit the limit while you work on it. The system just kicks you out. When will these big chains understand that web access is as important as running water for today's travelers? Reminds me of the old days, in cheap rooms in exotic places, where you throw a coin into a slot for hot water. If you shower too long, you wash you soap off with cold water (at least you can still wash it off). Conrad Istanbul is on a hill - you better be a good walker or you need to take a cab for everything. Next ATM, grocery store, coffee shop is about 10 min walk downhill and not very nice to walk.

The hotel is okay in terms of its facilities and I don't have any major complaints. However, it is too expensive for the level of service I received and for the facilities in the hotel. I stayed on the 7th floor in a city-facing room, which was fine because I was not expecting to overlook the Bosphorus or anything like that. However, the room has obviously not been updated for a long time. It was certainly clean and comfortable, but not at the level of other hotels I have stayed in around the world--at least at that price level. What was more odd was the service level. For instance, I checked my bags with the concierge and when I came to pick them up, I was asked to \"go pick them up yourself\". Not a problem, of course, except that my bags were in the storage room and the gentleman who had to get them out was in a bad mood for some reason and was extremely curt in his interactions.

I can understand that maybe there was a rush of some sort, but I have never faced such a situation before in any breakfast buffet. The choice was also sort of limited, although food was of good quality (as was the room service). I guess the hotel might want to complete what seems to be ongoing renovations (from other reviews).

One important thing to know is that breakfast is served on the 14th floor in what is usually a bar, but the views from there are also lovely, and it is not nearly as crowded as the big breakfast room on the ground floor, or the club lounge either. As other reviewers have noted, however, the bedrooms at least on the 8th floor, were \"tired looking.\" Mine room also had the peeling wallpaper, the chipped paint, the stained carpet, and the mildewed tile grout. It was also annoying that the shower was the American-style fixed on the wall and not removable. At least it was a non-smoking room. There were nice amenities and fantastic towels, thick and large. The fitness area was large and had many machines (could have used better ventilation perhaps). I also appreciated the iron and ironing board and the good light in the bathroom.

By the way, talking about the hotel staff. I would really like to say thank you to Nihat Kilic, the concierge. There was no better person to solve all our problems and answer all our questions than Nihat. He is very intelligent, with excellent manners, sharp dressed man. Everything we asked for was done within a second! What I liked was for example if we asked what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the best place to have dinner in, he not only listed the restaurants, he immediately showed them on the map, gave precise directions on how to get there and called the restaurant to reserve a table. What I want to say is that he kind of anticipates guests\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 wishes, he thinks three steps ahead! I remembered his name because he really-really impressed me and I wanted to thank him. During breakfast all the waiters are very attentive, you never have to wait while they suggest coffee or tea, they appear as soon as you sit down. Oh, and the breakfast is splendid! The choice is fantastic, everything is fresh and tasty. When you come to breakfast, you choose the table and while you are choosing your meal, the table is set up. The room. Our room was on the 6th floor. It was big, light and tidy. Tea, coffee were always refilled, cups washed, new vanity kits, soaps, shampoos were given on a daily basis. I did not hear any noise from the street when windows were closed, sound proofing is really good! What I loved was music in the elevator, it always made me smile. I also tried the swimming pool. The same moment you come to the pool, the lifeguard appears and gives you a big-big towel to use for the sun louger. The only disadvantage is that the hotel is not very close to main tourist attractions, but I loved that I could walk to the embankment and have dinner in any of the restaurants with a great view and then come back to the hotel and enjoy a cocktail in the summit bar, which has a fantastic view and warm green blankets to keep you warm at night. I also tried the internet caf\u00c3\u00a9 on the 15th floor. You can sit there and there is a choice of snacks there as well, so you can take anything and eat while checking your email or searching the web.

On the down side, the hotel is inconveniently located some distance away from Sultanahmet, Ortakoy and Taksim (and traffic is dreadful, so even short journeys take a long time); wifi is charged at an eye watering 50 lira a day; and bar prices are exorbitant. But perhaps that comes with the territory in a luxury brand hotel. But when things don't work so well, it's a different story. Our luggage had been lost by Turkish Airlines on arrival and they promised to have it delvered by 10 am the next day. We asked over and over again throughout the day. The concierge did call Turkish Airlines and got no helpful response, and the bag hadn't turned up in the hotel's luggage room. Eventually, by late afternoon, we had had to buy replacement clothes, etc and were starting to get frantic as we were leaving to go on tour the next day. The concierge just told us that it takes time to deliver things in Islanbul because of the traffic. Eventually, after an hour of standing at the concierge desk, the concierge left his desk (somewhat begrudgingly) to look for our bags. A few minutes later he returned from the basement with our cases. Goodness knows how long they had been there - perhaps all day. If so, it would have saved us from wasting a precious day of sightseeing and saved us from a lot of anguish. After our tour, we and a couple of other guests had been allocated rooms with twin beds despite our request for double bed rooms. We were upgraded to a suite room with a balcony, which was nice. The other couple were less fortunate and got a room with only an internal window looking over the lobby. And potential visitors will also want to be aware that the hotel hosts many tour groups and conventions. That means lots of people milling around; a noisy lobby and pressure on the lifts. In our return after our tour the hotel was hosting 500 guests wearing identical purple t-shirts. Most of these guests seemed to pass their time riding in the lifts between random floors, making it impossible for other guests to fit in the lifts.

Having enjoyed the Conrad experience elsewhere we hoped this would be a good end to our break but it was far from it and our stay at the Conrad turned out to be much inferior to our time at the Hilton Istanbul where we hadbeen based immediately before moving here. This is strange beacuse I thought Conrad was supposed to be a step up from Hilton bu,t in Istanbul at least, it seems that the profiles of each property are reversed. When we arrived at the Conrad we were checked in by a self-important staff member who really couldn't be bothered. She threw us a piece of paper explaining that the Club Lounge was closed for repairs and provided us with no other information about the hotel at all. We made our way to the room which was on the 15th Floor. It was small and the bathroom, which was really really small, smelled of stagnant water. The furnishings were dated and poorly maintained - the base of the bed was frayed and the whole room just looked tired. With the ClubLounge closed we stopped by the Summit Lounge on the 14th floor which, we were informed by the note we'd been given at check-in, was where the Club Lounge was relocated during the refurbishment works. Here we encountered two very offhand staff - we asked if we were in the right place for the Club Lounge and they just gestured to a table laid out with a few drinks and snacks and then got on with serving the Summit Bar customers who shared the space. We felt very unwelcome and as if we were just an inconvenience to the staff here. This was a shame because the Summit Bar and its Terrace has the best view of Istanbul we encountered during our time in this excellent City. When we checked in to our room at 3pm we had noticed very loud music playing directly outside the hotel. We assumed this would be short-lived and ignored it. After dinner we got back to our room to find a note from management to all guests warning of unrelated road and bridge closures in the City, but no mention of the mucic which was now playing even louder and, given that you couldn't speak easily on the phone as a result, was certain to spell a disturbed night's sleep for us. I called the Help Desk to log this politely and was told very brusquely that someone would get back to me once they had investigated. After 30 minutes I had heard nothing more so called again at which point the agent answered and then immediately disconnected me. I called a third time and before I could speak was told angrily by the agent that the duty manager was still investigating and would call back. A full hour after I'd first reported the problem the duty manager called to explain that he had just discovered that we were being disturbed by a music festival at the neighbouring University and that it should stop by midnight. The fact that this had seemingly taken the hotel by surprise, particularly given that the noise had been playing continuously for the previuos seven hours at least, was disappointing. The Duty Manager then arranged for a key for a different room on the other side of the hotel to be brought to us but by now it was almost midnight and we just gave up and sat out the final round of music noise in our existing room. Next morning came breakfast in the main restaurant - great food and hardworking staff who remained cheerful despite a crazy workload. The restaurant was totally overwhelmed by the numbers of guests and you just felt like you wanted to eat and escape the stress fast. There were several bus groups staying - which perhaps made things worse? If you plan to sight-see the Conrad's location is not great. It is not near the tram or metro so you need to travel by taxi which we found very slow given the heavy city traffic. As we left we approached the Concierge for help with taxi arrangements to the airport and she was as offhand as so many of the other staff we encountered during our stay. We checked out and of course the agent did not check we'd enjoyed our stay - but by now we had no expectations of such customer service basics and really were just relieved to be out. On the basis of our experience this last weekend I sadly conclude that this Conrad has none of the upscale credentials that its brand name suggests and that are shared by other properties in the Group. The in-room coffee machines here are good, the bathroom soaps and shampoos etc appealing, and the views form the Summit Bar breathtaking but those things aside, balanced as I'm often told I am(!), I'm afraid I can't think of a single other good thing to say in favour of the Conrad Istanbul.", "Date": "April 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wimberley, Texas", "Title": "\u201cWhere to relax in a bustling town\u201d", "Author": "llr43", "ReviewID": "UR105320717", "Content": "We finished our Morroco, Paris, Turkey trip with two nights at the Conrad Hotel to relax and unwind.

During our stay, the 14th floor was used for breakfast. The hotel is somewhat isolated but we walked down to the docks then to Dolmabahce Palace; but the lines on Sunday were forbiddingly long. We took a taxi to the bustling streets around Taksim, then back to the hotel, both short trips. We had excellent meals in the Meze 2nd - floor restaurant and the Monet ground-floor restaurant, particularly the lamb, and thought both meals uncommonly good for hotel restaurants. Prices were comparable to good restaurants in town. Our only fault with the hotel was being unable to reach the concierge over two days by phone prior to our stay to arrange for car service to and from the hotel.

On arrival at Ataturk Airport, Ali Ekber Bakir of istanbulairporttransfer was there to greet us and get us to the Conrad, then two days later, on time for our 3:15 a.m. pickup for the early flight home, so transportation worked out. The hotel is in a fine neighborhood for walking and across the street from the hotel is a park with sidewalks, benches, and some children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 equipment.

The hotel was pretty ordinary for a 5 star property. The room was small and there was no view. The skirting boards were scuffed and the room smelled of smoke, even though it was supposed to be a non-smoking room. The shower was over the bath, with a nylon shower curtain! The bed was very comfortable, though, with excellent linen. Breakfast on our first morning was in the Conrad's better restaurant, and was excellent, as was the service. However, when we returned to Istanbul towards the end of our tour, our breakfast on each morning was in a different location down near the hotel's Business Centre (perhaps reserved for tour groups), the food was inferior, and the service was poor. The Conrad's location is very handy to the Besiktas Ferry Terminal, from which one can catch ferries to many locations, and to small supermarkets and an internet cafe across from the very busy main road through the small park in front of the hotel. We had room service one night (soup and mezze) and were pleasantly surprised at the excellent quality of the reasonably priced food. A warning though - wine is outrageously priced at the Conrad. You can purchase Turkish wine of reasonable quality at the small supermarkets across the road. Is the Conrad hotel value for money? Absolutely not! We moved to the Sirkeci Konak Hotel for four nights after the completion of our tour.

I complained and recieved a (far better) room with a nice balcony overlooking the water. I do believe that was because I am a gold hhonors member. The room was large enough and had everything you would would find in all the other 4 star hotels. The bathroom was a huge let down. It was extremely small and I think that a 4 or 5 star hotel and especially Conrad should not have old bathrooms with shower curtains and showers in baths. The taps were old and hanging loose. The biggest irritation however came from the bathrooms of fellow guests: when one of the neighbours was taking a bath or a shower that created a lot of noise. My neighbour took baths late at night and you could literally hear the water flowing in the bath. It kept me awake until late at night. In the early morning several other guests took baths/showers which again woke me up very early. It resulted in bad sleep and irritation. It is probably the pipes that are extremely old or something, it wass very frustrating. The lounges on top are nice, but not more special then any regular Asian Hilton hotel. I have been in Conrad Singapore and Hong Kong and these are much nicer. Even the regular Hilton hotels are better in Asia compared to Conrad Istanbul. The views are stunning I must admit. Probably the best view in Istanbul. Don't think the hotel is not nice, it is still a good choice, although very far from tourist attractions.

The following day, they had organized my transfer to the suite, following reservations department; on the 7th floor again, The suite had the \"contractual\" view and size but was in bad need for renovation; I quickly went down to reception and asked for another room; I was again immediately given satisfaction and transfered to one of the nicest suites I have been to.

This stay was in August 2009. Approximately a week. We also visited Gallipolli and did the usual City tours and walking trips. We were a tad apprehensive about Istanbul to start with. We had no real idea of what to expect - but imagined something like Athens. This is probably correct. A very cosmopolitan city, where everyone is accepted for who they are. Turks are a proud race - who love their city. They are not Arabs - a mistake many make (and this in no way is meant as an insult to Arabs) . One of the first things we did was buy an acbil each (for travel on every convenience - bus, tram, ferry etc - and VERY cheap). We saw the spice markets, the museums, the religious buildings, the waterways etc - and would love to go back. Istanbul was perhaps the highlight of our trip. Which I still find unbelieveable ! The hotel is a little out of the main area - but very easy to get around. Returning from the spice markets on one day we took the tram (airconditioned and modern) half way (end of the line), then the bus (not as new - but fun) - and were dropped off at our front door. Much to the amusement of others on board (we gathered those in this Hotel didn't normally travel this way). This - in itself is an experience ! It was also easy to walk down the hill to the dock - and take a ferry into the other parts of the town. It is fun to try both methods. And nothing is that far. You can also plan a trip up the Bosphorus or the horn by ferry - very cheap - and use the acbil. The planning is half the fun - and staff at the Hotel can help. The hotel is extremely safe - everyone from Presidents to Prime Ministers have stayed there. It is almost perfect. Good staff, a friendly environment, and plenty to do (eg the pool). I noticed that \"Insight\" use it for some of their tours. It is very \"Anglo/American\" in many ways - but a pleasure to stay at. The views from the top floors are awesome. A tip - don't be frightened to sit at an outdoor \"cafe\" and enjoy the local coffee (perhaps with raki/ouzo) and an apple tea and just watch the passing parade. Also - use the local transport. Cabs are available - but not as much fun. The hotel helped make the trip the success it was. Excellent rooms, food, layout.

And I mean all the staff. What ever the management are doing there, they have got it right.

Down in the business centre it's cheaper if you only need a few minutes on their computers. Super cheap internet cafes over in the shopping area. The cost of telephone calls from your room can be exhorbitant. Suitably large plasma TV with lots of channels in about four languages. Unfortunately the image quality was particularly poor. The ensuite had most things but a power point for the hair dryer. The shower/bath plumbing is rather complicated (no intructions). The glass shower screen is too narrow as the floor gets wet. And there is no safety grab-rail at the shower/bath. The toilet is an old American model and takes up more floor space than need be these days.

Stunning way just to sit and watch the ships. The 15th floor executive lounge and 14th floor bar have the same amazing view. Restaurants were quite good, breakfast was included with our rate and there was a nice selection. Laundry is another very expensive item, but two items that I sent out happened to need mending and they did the mending at no additional cost which was greatly appreciated. The room designers knew what they were doing, the curtains are on separate tracks that overlap, meaning you don't get that annoying stab of light in the early morning, big kudos on that.

There are quite a selection of little shops across the road and some good kebap and fish places at the bottom of the hill (400m or so away). There's a public basketball court out front and a private tennis court as well as indoor / outdoor swimming pool. There's a nice little park with some neat exercise equipment that seemed to get a lot of use. All in all a very good experience. You're buying location and the service.

Based on the TripAdvisor reviews, we chose to upgrade to a Bosphorus view room, which I agree, was a good choice, especially since it wasn't much more. We arrived late on a Thursday night. The hotel has a lot of security, like hotels in the MIddle East, where all cabs are checked before coming near the hotel and you and your luggage go through a metal detector/screening. I felt safe though, so no issues with this. We were initially okay with the fact that we were 'upgraded' to a business room, while the desk clerk told us that they had pushed 2 beds together as we had requested one bed when we made our reservation. We thought this would be okay, especially since it was an upgrade, but as you'll see from the photo, it was just a bit odd. They did tell us that we could move rooms the next day but as we had big bags since this was the first leg of a long trip, and we were only staying 3 nights, we thought it wasn't worth the hassle. The business room didn't offer any 'upgraded' amenities and the closet was really small, big enough for one business person probably. Typical Hilton room, nice enough, but rather bland, no personality. The view was great though and we loved the little window sill/seat area as well. You can't open the windows too far, but my husband was able to get a few photos. The breakfast buffet was slightly above average, but there was a huge variety of options and generally things were kept hot, even when we arrived late. Each day we were able to find enough to eat that we only needed a small snack before dinner. Service in this area was pretty good. The hotel is located approximately 30 minutes from the airport. I had heard horror stories about cabs in Istanbul overcharging, but our meter was accurate and was even less than I had expected (about 35 lira/\u00e2\u201a\u00ac17). After exploring the city over the next 2 days, I would not recommend this hotel for its location. While it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manageable and the hotel does offer amazing views over the river, it was a hassle to get to most of the sights. It would likely be about \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15 to take a cab into Sultanahmet, where most of the sights are, we only did that once when going to dinner. The other times we walked approximately a mile and a half to the last tram station. Then it was a 15 minute ride to the sights. The first time it was a bit difficult to figure out the payment system as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not in English and the machines only accept coins, but once we had change, this was a very inexpensive and easy way to get into town. Taking a cab from this last tram station back to the hotel was a steal at approximately \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3, and saving at least 20 minutes of walking, part of it up a big hill to the hotel. While there is a busy street just a 5 minute walk from the hotel, none of the shops and restaurants would be of interest to a tourist, except perhaps for a quick snack. A cab was necessary to go out to dinner. The hotel itself is grand and opulent and the public areas are well-done. I especially liked the roof-top terrace bar which offered great views of the river. They had a unique drink and bar menu and while pricey, the drinks and steak sandwich I had were both good. While open-air, the roof could be closed off by glass, but also had heat lamps and the waiters offered blankets as well. There was a DJ there both nights we went as well. We found the concierge to be awful. I worked with several guys there and each offered just the basic info, almost rehearsed, no additional tips or insider information. Most disappointingly, one night we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to go all the way into Sultanahmet for dinner so we asked the concierge for a recommendation for a traditional Turkish restaurant nearby, they wrote down a name for us. It was pouring rain outside so we asked for an umbrella and they said they were all gone. We then got a cab in front of the hotel, the bellman telling the driver the restaurant name, then there was an exchange in Turkish back and forth and we were off. After driving around for almost 30 minutes (it was clear our driver had no idea where he was going) and after speaking up several times, although he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speak English, he finally understood enough to stop and ask for directions. My husband finally spotted the sign for the place and we realized that it was not right off the street but a good walk back towards the river. So we had to run through the rain only to stumble into a very fancy restaurant (all the waiters were in tuxedos) and immediately turn around as we saw we were seriously underdressed. We later learned that this restaurant was not even 2km from our hotel, so after the long and expensive cab ride, no umbrella, the horrible recommendation from the concierge as we were very casually dressed and the poor information from the bellman to the cab driver, this was a huge disappointment of a night. The next morning we spoke to the manager to share our experience so hopefully they could improve the situation. He was a bit defensive but overall professional and handled the situation well by leaving a long note in our room as well as some treats. They also arranged a complimentary transfer to the airport -- which because of traffic got us there just 25 minutes before our flight left, but we still made it! -- so overall we were happy that they addressed the situation and tried to make up for the inconvenience. My recommendation would be to be careful with the concierge here (which i usually am at any hotel) and service-wise, it's not on par with other 5-stars. Travel tip: Definitely recommend a Bosphorus cruise, but when you get on the boat, go on the left side. We sat on the right and while we thought that we would see everything as the boat obviously turns around, the boat goes really close to shore, so only if you're on the left side of the boat (which after leaving port turns to be the right side), you're really far from shore as opposed to being able to see everything on shore close up on the other side. It fills up and it's hard to move around as it's really narrow on the sides.", "Date": "April 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "California, USA", "Title": "\u201cVery good hotel, expensive, close to port, far from airport\u201d", "Author": "RoadWarrior71", "ReviewID": "UR61877904", "Content": "Overall, the Conrad Istanbul is a very nice modern hotel. It's close to the center of the city and within an easy walk of the port. Security is tight with metal detectors at the entrance but I notice this is true for pretty much all commercial buildings and hotels in Istanbul. My only major gripe is that they don't include free wifi access. When you pay 240euros a night, I don't like it when they try to get a little more. But they did throw in a very nice breakfast buffet and the room was roomy, comfortable, and quiet. I liked their fitness center with a swimming pool and hot tub although the water in the hot tub wasn't hot. I found that the best way to get around Istanbul is by ferry. Traffic can be horrible - my taxi in from the airport at 6pm took about 1h 15m. But you can take ferries across the Bosphorus Straits (separating European Istanbul from Asian Istanbul) for about $1 each way. You can also take a ferry from close to the Conrad to the Old Town (Haggia Sophia, Blue Mosque, and Topkapi Palace). If you're brave enough to rent a car, some ferries also take cars over. I highly recommend a visit to the Haggia Sophia. It was built as a church in 527AD, converted to a mosque by the Ottamans some time around the 11th century AD and it's now a museum. Awe inspiring building and architecture but take a guide or guide book with you since no audio tours are available. Of course, it was also featured in the James Bond movie - \"From Russia with Love\" My next recommendation would be the Topkapi Palace. You can easily spend several hours here so set aside at least half a day to do it justice. The cistern by the Haggia Sophia is another worthwhile attraction. It was one of six cisterns built by the Romans in what was then Constantinople. Other than the engineering feat of moving water from miles away using nothing but gravity, it also features columns that were used in pagan temples that were torn down when the Roman Empire converted to Christianity.

There was a steep walk from the hotel down to the street, but there were a number of small markets, fast food restaurants (including KFC, Pizza Hut and McDonalds) and Starbucks nearby. The hotel had a concierge desk which booked tours as well as a desk where you could exchange Euros and USD (including travelers checks) for Turkish Lira. The gift shop on the second floor was very small but had some nice souvenirs. The staff was professional. While I was there, I had an issue with a taxi driver near the Archeology Museum who cheated me out of $140 USD.

The location of the hotel is contrary to what some have written, really well placed, unless you limit your Istanbul visit to Sultanahmet, which would be unfortunate, as Istanbul has so much more to offer that the Blue Mosque (which, incidentally, is a must-see). You can be at the Besiktas port, or other small ports within 15 mins, or take a taxi, inexpensive wherever you go, take the Funicular up to Taksim, or the tramway, all within 15 mins. The room was an excective room, and apart from the violet walls in the bathroom (unusual choice) it was really beautiful. Every day, Conrad brought us new things for our room, free water etc, newspapers etc, so the staff pay great attention to detail. The breakfast was great on the exec floor, but this is especially because of the beautiful view. The surrounding area includes Dolmebahce palace and Besiktas stadium, boat trips and also Ortakoy, recommended to us by the hotel staff, which is a fantastic square with the most romantic view of the bridge (rivals the eiffel tower when lit up at night!) and great trendy restaurants. In Istanbul, you have to appreciate the diversity to enjoy it to the full, so hanging out with the young & trendy is as much part of Istanbul today as being in the old town. So for me, Conrad is the perfect place to stay, and if you go in summertime, the outdoor pool is a dream. Some people have referred to the high costs of the Conrad, but if you get a good deal on the website, you can enjoy an exceptional hotel for a great deal.

Carpet in both the rooms and the corridors were grubby and showed their age. Room and corridors on the Executive Floors have been refurbished, however, but you'll be paying a lot more to stay on those floors. On the positive side, the beds were very comfortable, enhanced by very soft and silky sheets. An LCD TV is the only nod to modernity.

The majority of rooms either face the small park/playground at the front of the hotel, or the surrounding neighbourhood. For a significant surcharge, one can upgrade to a room with a view of the spectacular Bosphorus Straits. The buffet breakfast in the main restaurant is adequate, but certainly not up to the over-the-top standards set by Asian establishments. The scrambled eggs appeared to have been made from a powdered formula, and tasted strange, hence I stuck to the hard-boiled eggs. On the whole, staff should be trained to smile a little more, be it at Reception or the restaurant. The Conrad is situated uphill in the residential quarter of Besiktas, which I was told was a very posh area, although it didn't look particularly upscale.

The roof top lounge is sophisticated, laid back, with amazing views of the Bosphorus and the Asian side. The location of the hotel in the neighbourhood of Besiktas is not convenient to the main sites in Sultanahmet but I did find a way around this without spending a fortune on taxis (about 15TL). You can take a taxi (about 5-6TL) to Kabatas tram station (this is where Dolmabahce Palace is also located) which has the excellent tram line to take you right into Sultahnamet (about a 15 minute ride - 1.40TL fare one way), as well, there is the Metro/subway station and funicular to Taksim at this terminal. Someone else told me about taking the shared buses from near the port area (about 5-7 min walk from the hotel) that goes straight to Taksim for 1.40 TL. I thought I also saw these mini-buses waiting right at the bottom of the street where the hotel is located (verify with the hotel concierge). The hotel is also only a 10 min taxi ride (about 6-7 TL) to the lively neighbourhood of Ortakoy. So while, the hotel is not in the most convenient location, it is considered partly in the suburbs of Istanbul and you are mingling with the locals.

It is not just the cost (which isn't a lot, although taxis may start to add up) but it is the time. Traffic can be bad and you can be stuck there with everybody else.

Almost every other cab in town will change his meter to night rate (2x) , not use the meter and ask for an exhorbant amount when it 's time to pay, perform a slight of hand when your paying them and insist you didn't give them what you KNOW you paid them - or all three!)

My helpful employer had initially placed me in a pleasant but standard 5 star hotel also conveniently located in Istanbul. In a world class city that offers an amazing range of hotel choices, I decided to move hotels when my family came to join me for the last weeks of my work assignment. I report that the Conrad Istanbul, part of the Hilton family of hotels, far exceeded any expectations, not only for its physical beauty and breathtaking vistas overlooking the Bospherous, but most of all for the very high quality and graceful personal presence of its hard-working employees at all levels of the hotel. My family (including the teenagers who are not easily impressed) especially appreciated the personalized attention offered to us by the exemplary sales and concierage services of Conrad Istanbul, but it is also true that every employee, from the friendly fitness room staff (in the lower lobby) to the very enjoyable hostesses/hosts & waiters in the restaurant/lounges in the lobby and the 14-15th floors, to the door and bell men and all the less-seen staff who managed our rooms all displayed a personal pleasantness that is not simply the outcome of a general public relations training but reflects the high quality of the individuals employed by Conrad Istanbul and their attitudes toward the true meanings of hospitality. We appreciated our visit to Conrad Istanbul more than we can say, and we recommend that visitors consider its very safe and beautifully-situated location in Besiktas district during your next visit to multiply layered magnificence that is Istanbul. (Walk out the hotel door to the bottom of Barberos, 5 minutes down hill, and take a sea-ferry across the shimmering strait to the Asian side of this great city, parallell to the continent spanning Bospherous Bridge, & look back over your shoulder and see the rise-up of your hotel, the Conrad Istanbul...)Tesekkur Ederim, thank you very much to Conrad, I hope we will meet again.", "Date": "July 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Abu Dhabi", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "towercrane", "ReviewID": "UR17635502", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the hotel for a getaway break not long ago.

Jean-Sebastian Kling, the manager of the hotel, has done an excellent job of making this hotel a great place to stay for business or pleasure. In addition, the Guest Services Manager, Oslan, is worth her weight in gold. Service and cleanliness were excellent throughout the hotel. We slept like babies in the comfortable King-size bed. What an incredible city and what an incredible country! We toured Ephesus before flying from Izmir to Istanbul. After visiting the ruins at Athens and Delphi (Greece), we were astounded by the large land area excavated at Ephesus (Turkey). I would rank Istanbul equal to London or Rome in terms of historic areas and tourist interest - and while not quite equal to Paris in overall impression, the incredible location at the Sea of Marmara and the Bosphorus makes Istanbul superior in terms of natural beauty to most other cities we have visited in Europe and Asia. I have attached a photo that I received as a courtesy from Manager Mr. Kling, after meeting him at the Summit Bar. It was taken from the Summit's terrace.

While there was nothing dramatic or poorly done in the hotel, it doesn't have the features that I have come to expect at the top Hilton hotels.

I stayed in a newer room on the 10th floor which was modest in size but not uncomfortably small. The bathrooms are acceptable but certainly not exceptional. The tub is standard as opposed to the large soaking tubs that are found in their other properties. There is no WiFi in the hotel and only the newer rooms have the wired broadband access. Connection speed was slow and unacceptable for video conferencing. It didn't support VPN connections but I'm uncertain whether this is a Hilton issue. The TV was in the 19-22\" size which again is modest for this class of hotel.
