The door doesn't even go all the way up to the ceiling! Therefore, there is no sound privacy. The shower faucet is placed such that when you use it absolutely EVERYTHING in the washroom will get drenched in water. The washroom is just that small. Everything else is fine. Beds, TV, cleanliness is all great. A great bonus is free wifi internet and free local phone calls! Overall this is hotel is VERY good value if you don't mind it cramped a bit.

The receptionist were not directly friendly but it seems they are really stressed by the daily work apart from guests checking in/checking out and my check in procedure was efficient though without any trouble. The hotel guests consist of many mainlaind Chinese from different part of China, I guess this hotel standard suits the middle class mainland Chinese tourists well. The single bed room was OK and it is not that small stated from some people here, I had a lot more space than only a suitcase, the desk is not spacious but enough to work with a laptop computer. The toilet was relatively bad (this was expected) since the whole toilet is the dedicated shower spot so you will stand in front of the toilet chair when the action begins. From the window it is the back street of Nathan road with some high-rises but its very quiet at the night (I stayed on the 7th floor).

Casa is, by far, the cheapest with the most convenient location I could find online. We paid in full for 3 nights upon check in and the curency was converted on the spot when my Malaysia issued credit card was swiped. For the first time, in using credit card at foreign country, I was getting such a disadvantageous exchange rate. To be fair, I don't know which party (hotel or HK bank or my bank) was to blamed. As for our standard double room, it was very small, comparable to Tune Hotel London that I stayed last summer. It took a little practice to figure out how to shut the bathroom door with me inside and how to wash my long hair in it. My tips? Remove the dustbin and extra towels from the toilet for more space. On first morning, we were woken up by noisy neighbour and their children running and shouting along the corridor. Luckily they checked out on that day. Cleanliness was overall ok and I did not get any bed bugs bite. The cleaner is helpful and friendly. I was very satisfied with the location of Casa Hotel. Yau Ma Tei MTR station entrance is just a few steps away and there's a lot of bus stops nearby, including the stop for Airport shuttle bus. We walked to the busiest shopping streets (Fa Yuen, Sai Yeong Choi & Tung Choi streets) every night and Langham is not that far if one is willing to walk. Finding food is never a problem here. One thing you might want to know that, Portland street is right behind the hotel. There are a lot of eateries here but also many prostitutes standing at the street. However, they did not pose any problem to us and basically the place is quite safe even for a single lady to walk (as long as she dressed decently). Upon checked out, they were very willing to store our luggage while we went out for more shopping. I know a lot of hotels provide this service, but Casa actually helped us to store luggage in a proper storage room, instead of just leaving them at the lobby/reception area.

Fed up we went down again and told him to change our room to our request( in fact before our departure I had email to them about our needs) and he still tried to ask us to upgrade.

I stayed in Casa Hotel for 2 nights recently. The rooms were way too small, and Casa Hotel charged the full fees even though one intends to cancel the room. So, it was too late for me to change to another hotel because of the huge sum I have paid for Casa. I know of another much better hotel in HK Island charging only 1 night of room rate if the cancellation is made after surpassing the 48-hour cancellation timeframe. Since Casa Hotel charged the full rate, I expected a better service and quality of the hotel, but alas, I was greeted with a pathetically small room with dirty walls and ceiling. We even had to change the room due to the 1st room had a leaking bathroom, causing the adjacent walls and carpet floor to be wet. In all the rooms that I had been to (I booked 3 standard double rooms for my family & friends), the bathrooms consisted of frosted glass partitions, which meant your room partner could actually see the outline of your body (although not clearly) while you took a shower! Furthermore, the bathroom door was not totally covered up, leaving a gap at the top of the glass door where the toilet odour could leak into the rest of the room. The whole bathroom would be wet after one completed his/her shower, since the area was too small with no proper partitions between the wet and dry areas. There was no fridge in the room, no dressing mirror on top of the work table (only a full-length mirror was available near the bedroom door), no proper coffee/tea cups (only glasses were available) and definitely no spoons/stirrers as well. There were also insufficient storage spaces for the guests. The lifts were small and each time 1 lift could only squeeze in about 6 people. If you have luggages, then there will be even fewer people that can squeeze into the lift. The only good thing about this hotel is the accessibility to the Yau Ma Tei MTR station (only about 15 or 20 walking steps away from the hotel!) and the street-shopping areas like Temple Street, Ladies Street, Sai Yeung Choi Street etc. around the Mongkok area. I would not recommend this hotel to any traveler seeking value for money.

You will not be able to fit in the toilet to go to the toilet properly; if you are bigger than the average asian, you will not fit in the bathroom/toilet area at all! No one can fit in the shower to have a shower. If you turn on the shower head, you will get everything wet, including the toilet and wash basin as it is all in the same area. After raising our concerns with the hotel admin staff, they said that this is the standard and provided us with the option to upgrade to a larger room which costs 100 - 300 HK more. From visual inspection of the premium room, the bathroom/toilet area is slightly larger, but still not adequate to fit us in for a proper shower (maybe a very unhealthy skinny short person, but not an average person). Having said all this, the hotel staff was very respectful and did not disagree with us about the bathroom being small. They were helpful by showing us the larger rooms to see if we would like to upgrade. We booked the Casa hotel through wotif.com. After contacting wotif.com with our concerns, then calling wotif.com on the HK toll free number, the wotif.com admin staff was very helpful and assisted us with cancelling our booking with the hotel straight away. The wotif.com admin staff confirmed with us that they would not take any cancellation fees, as we have already stayed our first night, and also agreed to stay out our 2nd night (since Casa was going to charge us for 2 nights stay).

No doubt this hotel's location is excellent, being just 1 minute from the MTR and within walking distance to Mongkok, where lots of shopping is.

The lot of us were prepared for small toilets but upon checking in to our room, we still got a rude shock. We initially booked for the standard room, and for this room type, the bathing area is non-existent. The toilet has just got enough space for the wash basin and the toilet boil - so if you wanted to shower, you have to do so IN FRONT of the wash basin (the area where you would stand when you wanted to wash your face), and shower over the basin and the toilet bowl. This means that everything in the toilet would be wet after you bath. We eventually decided to do an upgrade to the deluxue room (at extra charge) - the bathroom was just slightly better with a small area you could shower next to the wash basin. However, there was no shower curtain so everything you put on the ledge above the wash basin would still get wet (as in, really wet). I would say this hotel is still stayable if you are really just looking for a place to sleep after a day and nothing else, but if I had a choice, I would choose other hotels that I now know in that area for around the same price.

We had a double room (416) and single room (413) on fourth floor. The rooms were compact - space for bed, toilet/shower, small wardrobe, small desk and bedside table. We managed to fit our two luggage cases (standing up). The back of the hotel backs on to temple street market and the residential flats (see photo). Room 413 had the view of a high rise tower block undergoing works. They were conducting works nearby from about 8am each day. All rooms have a kettle, hair dryer, TV and air con unit. Iron can be provided on request. Beds are smaller than UK ones and harder but we found this quite comfortable. The shower/toilet unit was the biggest down side. When you shower everything will get wet. As there is no separating wall this also means that the room smells a bit damp. Glass is opaque so you can see the outline of the person in the shower/toilet. Generally the room was clean and was cleaned on daily basis so you get new towels and stuff. Mini toiletories are provided but we used out own. No soap/hand wash so we had to buy our own. The shower was good and powerful but there is no hot water in the basin tap. Reception is located on the first floor and the cafe on the second floor. Two (small) lifts serve the hotel. You will have to provide a 300 HK dollar deposit (refunded on checking out). You can leave yur luggage with reception even after you have checked out (which is what we did as our flight was 11pm). There is no safe facilities at the hotel but it is secure and there is usually a porter at ground floor entrance most of the time. There is a small money exchange counter on ground floor entrance but rates generally within HK were not so good so I would advise that you change money in UK. Plus my credit card company gave me a better exchange rate (even taking into the 2% handling charge) so I brought bigger items on my card rather than using cash. Most places will take credit card but not the markets and smaller shop units in big shopping centres (such as computer centres in Sum Sui Po and Mong Kok) would charge a fee or give you a higger price if not paying with cash. The best thing about the hotel was the location. Yau Ma Dai station is literally around the corner (2 mins away) and you can get the green and red lines on MTR from this station. Hotel is on Nathan Road which runs all the way down to Tsim Sha Yui. There is a 7 eleven two stores away and a bigger supermarket type shop (BLT) about 3 mins away (across the road). A number of buses run on Natahn Road, including a shuttle bus to and from the airport (A21) costing 33 HK dollars one way. Temple market is at the back of the hotel and Mong Kok is a 5-10 minute walk away, which was great for doing some serious shopping then coming back to the hotel for a nap/rest before heading out again. There are cafes and restaurants galore nearby. Nathan Road is also littered with gold/watches/jewellery stores. There is also free wi fi internet acces at the hotel which was a huge bonus as most hotels we looked at would have charged (a premium rate) for this. Overall this hotel suited our purpose - cheap but in an ideal location.

This becomes worse as u realise that the flat screen tv is fixed to the wall and your sleeping with your head literally 30cm away (albeit split by the paper wall) from the blazing tv audio.

They not only helped us with directions, but also came to our aid when we called them at 2AM to report a mysterious knock at our door. What separates this hotel from a hostel is the decor. It's almost as small as a hostel, so if you were thinking of staying here, you may want to consider a hostel.", "Date": "April 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wellington, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, small rooms, good for the price...\u201d", "Author": "APRS", "ReviewID": "UR54340581", "Content": "Hong Kong is expensive to get to from New Zealand and accommodation is the same there.

We upgraded to the next size on a special detail and it was well worth it, more room and bigger ensuite! Good staff and no issues. No restaurant in this Hotel but one next door, show your room card for a 10% discount! 7/11 Store next door as well - cheap beer prices! Good air con, and free wireless internet. This hotel is the best location on Kowloon and would stay there again without question. Recommend you upgrade to a better room if possible on arrival, was only NZD$10.00 extra a night.

If you are a light sleeper bring earplugs tho as walls are thin and you may get woken up when neighbor closes his door. Room is rather small and would not recommend this hotel to you if you are claustrophobic. The bathroom is small , standing room shower with frosted glass walls so lack of privacy if you are staying with friend. I chose it only becos of location and price.

In particular the bathroom is tiny. We had to shower pretty much right on the toilet. But for a bargain price of under $50 AUD per person (including free WIFI), we could not complain. Check in was efficient and staff were helpful, and we were able to store our luggage on the day we checked out for a few hours too. Best thing about this hotel is absolutely the close proximity to the Yau Ma Tei MTR. Step out of the hotel, turn right and in about 30 seconds you are there at Exit C. There is a 7-Eleven to the right of the hotel and plenty of options to choose to eat with snacks and restaurants a-plenty in the area. Temple Street Night Market is only a few minutes away by foot. Despite being on busy Nathan Rd, the rooms were quiet and sleep was not an issue. Only negative would be our friends room which had a small window so limited natural light and their room smelt like wet towels and they couldn't get rid of the smell. Lifts are tiny and so can be difficult to grab one down in the morning during peak times. So all in all I would stay here again if I was on a budget, but otherwise pay a bit extra for a bit of extra room if you need it.

This was a commercial building and turned into hotel, its about 2 yrs old. The lobby is located on level 1, and the staff was ok (could be more friendly). When we checked in, staff told us if we could upgrade to deluxe room if we found the standard room too small...i eventually did, cos when i opened my room door the twin bed were in front of me, no where else to walk and no where to put suitcase. the toilet was even more ridiculously small, 1mtre square, there was no tub, so you shower between the toilet and the basin. So the deluxe room is a better option, with more shower space and more roomy. The hotels only have two lifts, so during the day it takes a while before the lifts come...and each lift capacity was only 6 and 8 people. One of my biggest concern during this stay was the noise outside, as its located on nathan road, the bus and traffic was non stop day and night, even on the top floor, level 14, i could still hear the traffic and i had a lot of trouble getting to sleep. Despite all that, location was great, 1min walk to mtr and 7-11 right next door, heaps of places to eat, i recommend the congee restuarant and the chicken shop which is next door to it. The hotel restaurant served local snacks and i was surprised it was quite good too. The post office is about 5mins walk, this is quite important for me, as i always have to post things back due to my excessive shopping spree Although the MTR is 1min away, Mongkok is about 15mins walk, i walked back and forth about 3 times, and you dont feel like its 15mins cos as you walk there are heaps of shops, so if you end up too late in Mongkok you can always walk back to the Hotel.", "Date": "November 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cMy room was so tiny.\u201d", "Author": "NYTim", "ReviewID": "UR47124457", "Content": "Casa Hotel is located in Kowloon next to a subway station.
