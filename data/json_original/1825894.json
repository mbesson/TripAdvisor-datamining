It is a 2 star hotel and as you arrive you see why, the building is old and the breakfast area is small and with no decoration at all...BUT! as you enter your room you are surprise by a well decorated, clean and spacious room with comfortable beds and goos size bathroom. The AC worked perfect, the TV and the safe. What a value in a city where you feel you are being over charge on everything. It is quite easy to reach once you arrive to Venice with the information on it's location. BEWARE! We ran into a \"kind\" Viennese who offer to show us the way when we were 3 blocks from the hotel, once there I got ready to tip him and as I did he ask a whole lot more euros. This led to an argument that tainted the mood of arriving to one of the most beautiful cities in the world. I will return to this hotel again and again.", "Date": "October 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cA lovely little hotel in a quiet location.\u201d", "Author": "Misterwolf57", "ReviewID": "UR118832344", "Content": "Hotel Al Malcanton is an easy walk from the station and if you follow their instructions, it is not hard to find.

No worries here, this hotel is quiet, cozy and well managed. It is actually two hotels one above the other managed by the same group. The attention to detail and comfort of our room was really evident after coming from a hotel in Rome that was a bit disappointing. I can also see how it would be hard to find but prior to our arrival we received an email with step by step directions and a pdf. map. Peter the owner quickly became a trusted friend doling out advice and humour. The european style breakfast was ample warm and fresh each morning. Wi-fi is included and simple to access. Clean well decorated and fairly spacious for Europe. Modern fixtures and Murano glass light fixtures. Thank you Peter !", "Date": "April 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cThe accomodations are excellent and staff is great!\u201d", "Author": "amlynn5", "ReviewID": "UR71907739", "Content": "This hotel is really great. I stayed here with my family for 5 nights and it was a pleasant, Venetian experience. I arrived earlier than my family so they stored my luggage and I could take on the sites. I was able to get into the room right on time and rest for a bit. Each morning, the hotel serves a continental breakfast with warm croissants and made to order coffee or tea. It is a nice leisurely way to begin your day! The rooms themselves are huge and extremely clean. We stayed in a triple room which had one king sized bed and then a single bed. The beds were very comfortable. The bathroom was very clean and easy to use. They also provided soap and shampoo for our use and enough towels for 3 people. The staff each day cleaned the room, made the bed and ordered our towels. The highlight of this hotel is when I left I managed to leave my jewelry in the room. I didn't realize it, and thought I lost in route back to the USA. On the recommendation from my family I emailed the hotel to see by chance if I left it. They responded that after really searching they found it! It was a miracle to me! So, they sent it to me, FREE of charge back to the USA. I was so impressed with their concern and consideration of mailing it to me. I highly recommend this hotel to travelers in Venice. It is extremely, reasonably priced. The location is very convenient to the train station and bus station. It is also convenient to all the sites. We found it very easy to walk to and from. It is also on a quiet street, so even though you are on the ground level you don't have any noises. Their website is great and gives you a good view of the rooms and the breakfast.
