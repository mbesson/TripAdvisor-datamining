The good: clean and modern rooms, cotton sheets, comfortable beds, great location, great bar on the roof, access to many beach clubs, nice little mini bar, breakfast often included, not expensive hotel, professional and friendly front desk service. Lots of positives. The not so good: on 5th avenue. Noisy in the front rooms and there is a lounge and bar on the roof. You sort of can't get away from the noise. People coming down from the bar are usually quite noisy (between midnight and 1 AM). Turn the aircon on max to drown out the noise. There are issues with the wifi: if you are on Apple (phones, pads, etc.) you might not be able to log in (grrrrr). The front desk does have a computer and printer, but not connected to each other (grrrrr). Had to go to an internet cafe! This time was a bit too noisy and the wifi issue got to me. I had to go to Starbucks or other restaurants to get wifi. I would still recommend this hotel and I will go back. I had been there two years ago and they have made improvements.

Was a bit nervous, as there were not any traveller photos to look at, but what you see on the hotel website is actually what you get in this case. Really can't beat the location; on the corner of 5th and 8th, right in the middle of all the action, and barely one block from the beach. Our room was more than adequete, and had a huge window overlooking 5th Avenue. The bed was really quite nice; my husband says it was more comfortable than our own bed at home! Alot of thought has obviously been put into furnishing this hotel-kind of a relaxed/modern look, very nice. The lounge on the roof was nice, with a little tile pool to dip your feet in and comfortable lounges. Nice to relax with a drink and either look out toward the water or down at the people on 5th. Have to admit, I was very concerned about the possibility of a noisy, party-like atmosphere, but the only noise we ever heard were the sounds of some high-heels on the stairs going to the lounge on the roof a few times-and who can control that?? Didn't really bother us, and I'm a pretty light sleeper. The bathroom is very small, but very nice-vessel sinks, waterfall showerhead, etc. The shower itself is almost the size of the rest of the bathroom, so no worries there. The shower floor is actually teak slats spaced 1/4 inch apart, so the literally goes down the drain- thought that was a nice touch. The front desk has beach towels available, and they hold your room key while you're out as well, so no worries about losing your key. Really can't say enough about the staff-very friendly and helpful.
