I had a bad feeling about this place and if I hadn\u2019t arrived late that evening at around 11pm, I would have gone elsewhere. On seeing my room, I realised that my fears had been justified! I was shocked and disappointed to discover that my Double Studio apartment was actually a tiny room with some kitchen appliance built into a wardrobe. To make things worse, the TV and phone did not work at all and there was a horrible stench of sewage coming into the room. Despite raising my issues with the receptionist/ manager, nothing was done to resolve the situation since they had already been paid for the entire stay. I was promised that I would be moved to another room but on the next day the manager did not seem to care and no action was taken. I repeat, DO NOT STAY HERE!

Do not sign up for an extended stay (more than three days per the hotel rules). We wanted to leave after 8 days of our 13 day stay, but we had paid for the full stay in advance, and the clerk pointed out the policy posted on the wall in the lobby: no refunds for extended stay. Pay a day at a time if you insist on staying here. There were plenty of open rooms. 2. Even for a discount rate in London, this one is not worth the money. Our room was 10 x 10 feet at most. The bed took up the bulk of the floor space. Upon entry, the room smelt of sewer fumes. The kitchenette took up the rest ... at least it worked. 3. The quality of the room renovation was poor. Paint job was sloppy. The furniture was real cheap and worn. 4. The tiling on the bathroom walls were cracked, and the shower handle fell off. Two of the lights did not work. The halls were noisy because of the wood floors. Other guests were noisy. The windows did not in the least keep out any of the street noise. Bring your earplugs! 5.

This was because the heating was unable to be turned off. the room was on the Earls Court road, so our choice was either road noise or heat stroke. There was no TV remote - as apparently the previous occupier had run off with it!. So we were advised to climb on a chair to reach the TV controls on top of the wall mounted TV. The shower was amazing - no idea you could get that many cracks in tiles and the novelty toilet seat [it was not attached so kept falling off] was fun too. But I think the highlight of our stay was the bed collapsing at 3 am. It is a cheap bed with removable wooden struts under the mattress - which when you moved - came out. Needless to say I asked for the manager - who apparently does not actually exist - so I was given a phone number to call the day after I left. As of course you have to pre pay - the attitude of the 'management' appeared to be ' we have your money, so we dont care how good /bad your stay was' Interesting experience and if you want an urban endurance course experience or are possessed with a masochistic streak - this is certainly the place for you.

Furious, we demanded that they honour our original booking back at Earls Court. We was told that we could stay in another place across the road, but had to pay another \u00a3125.00 more! Refusing to pay the extra we asked to speak to the Management. Amazingly we was told that the Manager was in a meeting (5pm on a SATURDAY NIGHT) and would not speak to us! So we got our suitcases and walked back to Earls Court to speak to the Management in Person. We was met by a Receptionist who initially wouldn't get the Manager but eventually someone can out to us, got some keys and showed us two rooms (amazing as we was told that they were fully booked). Not one word of sorry for the terrible experience we had suffered. We stayed the night as we could got find an alternative for the evening at such short notice. Be warned that the building is dangerous, exposed electrical wires and inadequate fire precautions. Terrible, terrrible place. In a nutshell - The scam is to pretend Hotel is fully booked, show you a filthy alternative, try to squeeze more money from you by showing you somewhere clean but for double the original price quoted.

Upon check-in we were requested to pay the full amount of our stay in advance (quite unusual, travelled around the world never experienced such terms and conditions, hah); without the full advance payment we were denied to see our room (or any rooms for that matter) and to our query were told this is their Company Policy. It may start to shine on you at this point already that such precondition is part of their PAY or get 'stuck' scheme as the website agent already reserved \u0141100 on my bank account to secure our online booking. Hey, the studio apartments are about 2x2.5 meters, so it's either you stand or lie in bed - no running around, and my son has a single bed the size of these ridiculous 'doubles' :))) Later in the evening after our ungracious check-in (remind you: after the full advance payment of 4 nights!) we ran into some sanitary and health problems (broken tiles, broken shower plexy glass, broken metal hangers in the shower room, mildew, etc) which we immediately reported at the reception and asked for another room. We were offered an 'upgrade' at \u014180 surcharge and shown a decent (but still miniscule) room which we denied claiming we booked a superior room in the booking system where there no 'luxury room' options - only rooms at fixed prices. Next morning after a refreshing sleep in the 'mini double bed' (140x190 dubbed a double?) massaged by broken springs in the matress we were greeted by the happy bedbugs. I didn't miss out the chance to give one little guy 15 minutes fame on camera prior to final termination. This really had us going and we were ready to move out immediately. We offered the receptionist an amicable solution with them granting us a refund and us leaving in peace (i.e. forgetting all the nuances of our stay and not following-up on the story). We were confronted with ignorance and absolute denial by an obnoxious receptionist (the same one who claimed their company policy is to show our room only upon full payment). I asked to talk to the manager and was told she is not on the premises, I also was denied any contact to the property manager/owner (name or contact telephone number). Hey, she was the invisible woman with no mobile number in the 21st century! We checked-out nevertheless and agreed to come back at 1.00 PM to meet the manager and discuss the issue. We returned at 1.00 PM - of course no manager was around - and were told that the manager will not be on the premises that day. We were again denied any assistance and contact to the hotel management. At this point asking for a full refund and/or invoice we were denied both by the receptionist. As we checked into another hotel by then (of course not into a free room) I made an official complaint at the police as we were not given any invoice OR refund - I was there with my pants down - who knows what lies could have followed if we don't record the issue. Further to this - following some helpful legal advise - I have made an official complaint at the Health Department of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. These were needed for the records to avoid any future lies by the Hotel. Eventually we got an invoice from the hotel 2 days after (!) after our check-out only with the direct assistance and presence of a helpful Borough policeman. No refund was paid by Dylan Earls Court, meaning we are short of GBP 360, not to mention all the stress and ordeal as you can imagine. I tag this situation DAYLIGHT ROBBERY and strongly urge you anyone to steer clear of this 'Hotel'.

Here is my overview: 1. The booking process was fairly easy at the website. THE WARNING: The site owners mention that this is NOT their website. It supposedly belongs to some company called Adverstising On Line (AOL). Hence changes to the reservation cannot be made onsite - any changes made are not honoured. In short, even though the website carries their brand, they do not honour their commitment 2. Check In : Fairly smooth process. You have to pay the entire amount up front. Read the contract carfully!!! 3. Rooms : I had got the standard double room. The photographs on the site are not at all representative of the room. The room is dilapidated and is smaller than you could imagine. The linen is old. There are broken appliances lying in the room. Another point - Wi-FI is not included in the room rate, though there is no mention of a charge on the website. One look at the room and a smell of the place and I wanted to check out. 4. Customer Service : I confirmed with the desk when i could check out from the site without a penalty. The contract signed says that anything over three days is a long term stay. However, the gentleman at the reception assured me that i could check out after 48 hours without a penalty. I made alternate bookings based on this. However, when i went to check out, the hotel manager refused to honour that commitment. They said the employee was new and there was no refund for the two extra days (that were committed to me) since it was mentioned in the sign-in contract. Further, since i did not book directly with them(there is no webiste for this), they could not change the reservation. In short, they have stolen GBP 150 from me as a result of this. Please avoid this location - the management is dishonest. 5. Location : The property is well located on Warwick road in Earl's court and a short walk from Kensington High Street. Be warned, however, that it is on a busy street and you will hear traffic all night and all day. 6. Other : There is a penalty of GBP 50 for not returning the key - be very careful about this if you are still adventurous and decide to stay at this site. This is an absurd charge and something you need to be cognizant of.

The room we were given was no more than a box. The curtain was so short it didn't reach to the bottom of the window, so what did they do to solve the problem?? Well they unpicked the hem to make it longer, however this still did not work. Why did they not replace it? The builders outside could see us getting changed and showered! The kitchette consisted on a very small cupboard with a microwave, kettle, hotplate and sink. This very small space was a massive fire hassard! There was a sign explaining how to use a fire blanket but no sign of a fire blanket or extinguisher in sight!! The bath had the taps at one end and the plug/overflow pipe at the other. Exactly how was I supposed to take a bath?? Impossible!! The Bath panel was made of plywood. The door into the bathroom was broken (see picture) so you had to watch each other on the toilet and in the bathroom!

The 'bathroom' door wouldn't even open fully as the bed was in the way, the 'kicthen' was a cupboard with a sink and microwave in it. The bathroom was the smallest bathroom i've ever seen, i'd say if you were above average weight you wouldn't be able to turn around in the bathroom, or the shower, I struggled at 9stone! My partner and I had to brush our teeth one at a time as we both couldn't fit in. There was a gaping hole in the shower wall, no window and very dark. The hairdryer was an ancient brown plastic box mounted to the wall which wasn't even connected to the tube which blew out pathetic air. The room was ridiculously hot but the sash window didn't stay open so we had to prop it open with a wicker basket. When getting ready we had to leave the main door open just to let some air in. Nowhere to store anything, we had to do things one at a time as there just wasn't the room. Overall, the room was tiny and I can't believe we spent the \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 on it, but I suppose that's London. They were renovating further down the building and i'm assuming the part we stayed in, where reception is, is yet to be done. Also, i know they always advertise their best rooms and pics on websites, but this is totally false advertising at it's best. The only positive thing is the location, about a minute walk from Earls Court tube which is on the Picadilly line for the City.

If you ask me, these are greedy, unconscienable money suckers that take advantage of clueless tourists/out of towners that really when they get here, because of their limited time, resources and knowledge about the area, are likely not to be able to do too much about their treatment.

Thinking there had been a simple clerical error we attempted to find the source of the problem and get another room. Well...this is where simple bad communication and customer service became Fawlty Towers level ineptitude and bufoonery. We were informed that no other rooms were available and that, anyway, the hotel reserved the right to provide rooms for guests that were different from those booked and confirmed. When we tried to argue the point they just held the line that, despite confirming a twin room for us, they were perfectly within their rights to swap it for another without telling us if they wanted to do that. We checked out on the spot and were lucky enough to find a genuinely good hotel round the corner - one that provided a generous suite and superb breakfast (which we wouldn't have gotten at the York) for only \u00a315 more than we had paid at the York.

We were a bit disappointed that it was more expensive than our first choice AND breakfast was not included, but not wanting to go to another altogether unfamiliar part of London, we took it anyway. The first impression was quite good: a nice, clean reception, professional-looking, though it soon became quite clear that one of the receptionists was new. Checkin went quite slow, also because her English wasn't all that clear, but you know, new job, we've all been there. And anyway, we were on holiday, so it's not like we were in a rush. The lift was not working, so we had to climb the stairs to our room on the second floor, where we encountered our first obstacle: the keycard didn't work. Well, it did eventually, but only after about 5,000 tries. We were a tad annoyed about that, but we let it go. Don't want to start complaining after 5 minutes of being here. The room, on first glance, looked okay. Very small, but being budget travellers, we're sort of used to that. We did notice on closer inspection that the plastic cover had fallen off the fire alarm, and that the front of the bath had come off exposing the wooden board behind. All the curtains were closed when we came in, and it being a rare sunny day in January, Di decided to open them and look out. Big mistake. As soon as she gave the curtain a pull, the rail came off the ceiling! The room being quite high, and we being quite short, we couldn't put it back up, so we told the receptionist \"the curtain has fallen down\" and she promised to have someone in to fix it for us. However, when we came back that evening after a visit to the theatre, it was to find that only the fire alarm had been fixed, but the curtain was still crumpled on the carpet as when we left. Clearly someone had been in, and I wonder how they could possibly have missed that. Anyway, it being quite late, we decided to leave it for the moment, even though our window turned out to be right in front of a street light so that we didn't sleep much. On our first morning in this hotel we woke up stiff and cold, because the blankets were really quite thin. When trying to make tea in the little kitchenette, we soon figured out that there was no power to the socket where we were supposed to plug the kettle in. We put the kettle on the nightstand and plugged it in there, where it did work. Also, we had to test the little cups of milk in the fridge in a glass of water first, as some were past their sell-by date. When we came back from a brilliant day in London, we found our curtain still on the floor, even though the maid had been in and must have noticed it as well. When Di wanted to go for a shower it turned out that our used (and still wet!) towels had simply been picked up off the floor and folded up again! So, yeah, not much good to be said about this place. The staff are very friendly even though they don't actually solve your problems, and try to be helpful with questions about London transport and so on. But if you want (more) value for your money, we do suggest trying your luck elsewhere. There are a lot more of these kinds of hotels in London that are cheaper and do offer you breakfast, and may even have rooms that don't fall apart.

Hotel is not worthy of one star!", "Date": "September 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scheveningen, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cHandicapped\u201d", "Author": "Boardgamer", "ReviewID": "UR8740737", "Content": "Every year in the last week of January we, my wife and I, visit the Toy Fair in London, being a family board games collector the annual Toy Fair at ExCel is a must. A couple of years we found out that my wife suffers from Multiple Sclerosis and has problems with her balance. She now uses a so called \u201crollator\u201d i.e. a walking aid on wheels, not a wheelchair. For our purpose we were looking for a hotel suitable for handicapped people. To store the medication for my wife the hotel had to have a private fridge as well. In the available Dutch brochures the only one we found was York Hotel. The hotel is situated in our favourite area, Earl\u2019s Court, shops, restaurants and the busstops nearby. (I mention busstops specificly, despite the fact that Earl\u2019s Court Underground Station is wheelchair-friendly - I checked it personnally - and as long as not every Underground Station is wheelchair-friendly, we\u2019ll use the busses. After all, what we do have is time, but this aside). We stayed there from January 24th untill January 28th 2006. The first hurdle a handicapped person faces is the hotel entrance. Always stairs, 4, 5 or more steps to get to the entrance doors. The entrance of York Hotel is excellent. The distance from the fence to the hotel entrance is about 4 yards. The distance is covered by platforms, every platform is large, what\u2019s more, large enough for a wheelchair. Every next platform is raised about 5 inches, so getting into the hotel is a piece of cake. The only minus point is that the platforms are very smooth, they could be slippery when they are wet. One has to be cautious. The receptionists we spoke to were all very kind and helpful, and so was the other staff. We were given room no. 15, ground level. A large room divided in two parts; a bathroom and a \u201cliving\u201d room. At first glance the room is suitable for handicapped people, but looking at it with a critical eye you see a lot of shortcomings, as if it\u2019s done in a slapdash way; Yes, there is a spacious bathroom, a very good shower and a toilet especially equipped for handicapped people. No complaints on this front. On the other hand, the drain cover is about an inch below the shower floor, this is dangerous. When you by accident step on the edge of the draincover you easily can lose your balance and fall. Yes, the bathroom is provided with a red emergency cord, but when you slip and fall in the bathroom and you can\u2019t stand up again you won\u2019t be able to reach the emergency cord: it\u2019s situated in the wrong place, and it\u2019s too short. It should not hang down from a wall, but cover all the walls in a horizontal way about a foot from the floor. We notified the staff about the shortcomings but nothing was done about it. The \u201clivingroom\u201d itself is not very large. Rather small actually. Bed on one side, wardrobe and kitchenette on the opposite side and a very small path in between. The fridge in the kichenette met our requirements. There is just enough room left to store your luggage (including our rollator). There is no room available underneath the bed to store luggage. This space is taken by a massive wooden box. The bed is too small for two people to be comfortable. The small path is not level with the floor. Halfway it\u2019s a little elevated. When you are not aware of this you might fall. There is no room to fall forward or backwards, only sideways. You\u2019ll get stuck between the massive wooden box underneath the bed and the wardrobe/kitchenette/fridge unit. To get up again you must be a contorsionist. In this room a handicapped person cannot be left alone! You will find a flat screen TV on the wall. A deposit must be paid in advance for the remote control. Only a few channels could be found. We informed the management about this, but nothing was done about it. (Where did I read all this before?) A ventilator completes the furniture. The breakfast restaurant is situated in the basement. An elevator takes you there. Standard is a simple continental breakfast, extra charge for a full English breakfast. We had fried and/or scrambled eggs, sausages daily, and toast, jam, milk, orange juice, coffee and/or tea as much as we liked. A full stomach to start the day. Reading the latest reviews from the beginning of 2007 I am afraid that nothing has been changed to the better. York Hotel is not mentioned anymore in the Dutch 2007/2008 winter brochures. My travelagent and I are searching the internet for an other hotel that meets our requirements, but no luck so far.

We are both tall people - the mattress was on the floor in a room where you could not swing a cat let alone put two suitcases in. Our curtain had cigarette burns in it; the bathroom (is that what they called it??) was a tiny basin and shower that you had to move the shower screen to use the toilet. The toilet was dirty. The room had not been vacuumed (nor any other day) and it smelt. As for borrowing an iron and ironing board - charged to borrow both! (As if anyone could steal them - would be good going through Customs with an iron and ironing board). The breakfast is not how they advertise \"big breakfast room area..\" - lucky if could get ten people in there. Very basic. The internet at reception - charged to use and then find that it shuts you down before you can send! Reception personnel either sat playing on the computer or smoking outside. Never heard the phone ring once. As I was typing on the charged internet - I heard many people complaining at reception about various things. They just did not care. If I had not paid in full for three days we would have left. Very unhelpful with directions, very rude and could not care less attitude. The worst place my husband and I have stayed. Great location - that's it. Plenty of other really nice establishments in the area bit further down the road near all the restaurants, shops etc. Other people we met at breakfast also said would never recommend or stay again.

We had to turn the water off every 30 seconds to let the water work it's way down the drain lest we flooded the room).
