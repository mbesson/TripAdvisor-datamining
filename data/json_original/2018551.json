As for the bad points, which justify my 3 stars (in fact, i was choosing between 2 and 3): 1) too close to the train station, can be very noisy (day and night); 2) had to wait for an hour to check-in (i arrived at 4:00pm)- \"the room is not ready yet\"; 3) got a non-smoking room despite the request for a smoking room when booking; 4) cleaning was average- tables and floors were left dirty sometimes, irregular replacement of complimentary tea and coffee, bath supplies, minibar items; lack of bath supplies (no shampoo); had to wait for an hour for the room service once, when asked for complimentary tea (i got back at 9pm once and found out the cleaning lady didnt bring tea again); 5) no door in the shower- water flows to the floor; 6) safe deposit box in the room wasn't opening properly: it never opened on the first try! you have to press buttons with pressure, so it opens on the second try. If not- it's temporarily blocked for 15 minutes! 7) unstable wi-fi connection (room 511) 8) staff could be more friendly, some staff speaks english VERY BAD- with a strong spanish accent. 9) double bed is just two single beds put together 10) no one helps with luggage 11) charged my credit card with a full amount at the moment of booking 12) at the check-out i was told to pay about 20 euros for the service i didn't use, but the receptionist could say what it was. So i just pay for the minibar items ive taken and refused to pay for this undefinable service. 12) cleaning ladies can wake you up at 9 am, entering the room without knocking.

The hotel is new (opened in 2011) and it's just one minute far from Friedrichstrasse S-Bahn, U-Bahn and regional Trains, which means you are basically connected to every single place of the city including the direct train to Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport. Trains are almost invisible for the customers because the building is perfectly isolated from noise. The services of the hotel are great: a swimming pool at the 8th floor, sauna and gym provides you everything you need for relax. The cafeteria and lobby bar is good enough and the breakfast is excellent. Another pros of location: you're really close to the Museum Island, the Unter den Linden, the Reichstag and the Brandenburg Gate. This is definitely a great hotel. I insist, in my opinion the hotel offers 4* services and 4* price. So it's a good value option. The staff speaks good english and german. There're many spanish trainees thus Spanish speakers could find it a positive point to consider. Additional info: Berlin is not a tradition shopping-city (boutiques and so on) but there're some stores in the same Friedrichstrasse and the Unter den Linden. Supermarkets: There's one excellent supermarket at the Friedrichstrasse, once you leave the hotel's alley on the right. Another option is to buy at the supermarket just you get out of the S-Bahnhof of Friedrichstrasse, inside the station.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buckeburg, Germany", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location\u201d", "Author": "Mandy M", "ReviewID": "UR127712026", "Content": "Just recently returned from a short family break in Berlin.

Only met hotel staff on checking in and out, but pleasant and friendly. We did not eat in the restaurant due to the rather high price, but found several breakfast bars within the station (particularly Le Crobag!) and good restaurants both towards the river--Fritz a favourite for German food) and underneath the railway arched along Georgestrasse.

Location in Berlin is the most important thing in your visit.Eurostars has the BEST location you can imagine.First outside the hotel and in a 2 MINUTE walk there are U and S Bahn (aka subway and train) that lead to the most central places in Berlin.Two stops from Alexanderplatz ,three stops from Halleshes Tor which is the station where you can take the U1 to Charlottenbourgh and east berlin across east side gallery.If you dont want the subway Eurostars is a ten minute walk to the MUSEUM ISLAND(including 5 museums and two of the best museums of the world the Pergamon museum and the east cultures museum), a ten minute walk to Checkpoint Charlie, a ten minute walk to the Brandeburg gate,Parliament and Tiergarten park and also a fifteen minute walk to Alexanderplatz which includes the TV tower and some churches to see.So some say the location of the hotel is great.I say its the greatest that can be.And in Berlin this is the most important thing. Regarding the hotel itself.Its a great building with very beautiful design inside.The staff of the hotel is very kind and helpfull.They can book some tickets for you(ask for a booking to the TV tower).The rooms are big enough and very clean with everyday cleaning and a bathroom with villeroy-boch and bathtub included. Regarding price.We booked for 5 nights for 580 euros breakfast included.Thats a normal price for a new and clean hotel.Keep in mind that there is FREE WIFI with good speeds when in other hotels(etc Hilton ) is almost 20euros a day.So the price is seriously good for a big city with lots of tourists.

Although if the side jets were used on the shower, they flooded over the walk-in-shower onto bathroom floor. More towels needed. This is nit-picking. Buffet breakfast was included for us and the choice gave you everything. One day eggs were cold and served coffee a bit strong/bitter but there are coffee machines andhot water urns, tea pots and many kinds of tea to choose from. The gym is small, but how many excercise bikes does one need?! Pool is cold. The lobby bar is small but the staff compensate with their friendliness and good service.

The only reason I held back, and gave it an overall 4 stars is that we did not get to sample either the restaurant or the leisure facilities. The location was superb. Right beside the train station at Frederikstrasse, which is intersected by several lines. The shops along this street are also fantastic and we were within a few minutes walking distance of Unter den Linten. The hotel was spotlessly clean and everything looked fresh and new as if it was only open a week! The staff were very friendly and helpful. Our bed was very comfortable and large with lovely soft linen. The shower was good and the range of toiletries left for us was very good, even including a comb and a shoe buff. We were in one of the rooms on the 5th floor overlooking the train lines. With the windows closed it was nice and quiet, and we were not disturbed when we were sleeping which initially I had been a little concerned about. The air conditioning was easy to work in our room (and it worked well) which was very important given that we had to keep the window closed. The safe was large enough to accommodate a laptop, and easy to use. There was tea/coffee making facilities in the room, which was great for getting us started in the morning, given that we did not have breakfast included in our room rate. The bathroom was beautifully tiled, and I also loved the wooden effect floors, which were so much nicer than some of the grubby carpets you see in hotels that are even just a few years old. We had some wine at the bar in the evening (a little pricey at 6 euro for a small glass) but it was very nice, and we were very impressed with the friendly and attentive barman who looked after us. There were two computers available in the lobby for guests to use, and we had free Wifi in our room also. (Wifi reception was not so great in the room, but downstairs my husband was able to use his iPhone all the time). I couldn't say a single thing against this hotel and I would highly recommend it for anyone wanting to find their way around Berlin on a first visit, as being so close to the station made life very easy. I would like to have sampled the food there, but for brunch we ate at the little cafe just beside the hotel, at the entrance to the train station. We bought a bottle of water, a roll with ham and cheese and a pizza slice, and it was just over 6 euro! Great value and very tasty. Finding the hotel was made easy by the directions left by a previous reviewer, and just to reiterate, the hotel is found by crossing under the railway bridge opposite Mc Donalds, and walking down the lane to the side of Block House restaurant. Without those instructions I think we might have found it a little hard to find.

Our expectations were therefore high when we booked a double room at Eurostars Berlin (5 stars). The hotel is new and elegant and is very favourably situated in central Berlin, but a bit tucked away in a narrow alley although close to Friedrichstrasse and Friedrichstrasse railway- S- and U-Bahn-station. The room was OK and the breakfast opulent and meeting most demands one should think. Our first disappointment came after having checked in: There was already luggage in the room we got and clothes on the bed. Our immediate thought was that the previous guests had had to leave in a hurry and might have forgotten some of their things in the room. I therefore rushed down to the reception to inform them of this possibility. Then they found out that \u201cour\u201d room was in fact already occupied! Very embarrassing! A good thing though the occupants didn\u2019t arrive as long as we were in their room! Yes, we got another room, but a rather modest excuse. The receptionist gave us the impression that such things happen! But this was not all. The breakfast was between 6.30 and 11, which means that the cleaners normally would wait until about 11 before wanting to clean the room. Here they knocked on the door at 10 wanting to know if we wanted to have our room cleaned. Of course we did, but not if that meant that we had to leave the room immediately, which it obviously meant. Normally the hotel personnel is discrete and wait until they know a room is empty before starting to clean it. Another day we came back to our room at 5 p.m. to have a nap, which has been possible in all other hotels we have stayed in. We noticed that our room was not cleaned and shortly after the maid came and wanted to do her job \u2013 at 5 p.m.!? We also have to say we were not overwhelmed with excitement over a shower that is so modern that one needs a technical course to operate it.

At midnight when we had returned to our room and had some difficulty setting the room thermostat to a desirable temperature , the staff even offered to change us to another room if the temperature was not to our satisfaction within a short period. This is what I call excellent service. We would most certainly recommend this hotel as a great location and for it's excellent value and friendly stall. Thank you and well done to all.

Twin (two beds pushed together) was very comfortable, bath room with bathtub/shower combined was very clean and spacious. By the way, there is speaker fixed in bath room so that you can enjoy the music or listen to TV news or others, a phone set provided as well. The breakfast was excellent, it's buffet style,there were many variety kinds included hot, cold, fruits, salad, soft drinks of course many kinds of coffee. The staff in front desk speak Spanish as main language (I supose) because they talked to their colleagues not in German but Spanish as normal. We requested a twin room when we checked in, because they provided double room ( a big bed with one blanket), we took quite a while to get through due to English is not good enough for them to communicate nor German my husband speaks German. The higher floor is right choice, bcz from 1st to 5th(?)floor some rooms are facing inner lobby, the window just can open very very limited and not fresh air from out sight. It still remans polish chemical smell in the room.( #216 was allocated but we refused, and requested to change another room).

Unfortunately the hotel shows many signs of not yet being ready for its official opening. A number of other reviewers have made comments about issues such as how hard it is to locate the hotel from street level. We can only agree wholeheartedly about this. It wasn't until I'd walked half a block along Freidrichstrasse and happened to look back that I happened to glimpse the Hotel Eurostars name on a building above the s-bahn line. The hotel has no frontage at all onto Freidrichstrasse, despite it's address. We also found that the revolving doors failed to do so for much of our stay. Staff support for guests was not what one would expect from a supposedly 5 star property. We found that room cleaning didn't extend to replacing dirty glasses and mugs with clean ones, nor replacing toiletries or tea and coffee facilities, despite a request to the \"customer service\" line for this. Breakfast on our second morning at the hotel was a shambles. During the time we were attempting to enjoy our breakfast the buffet was out of milk (hot or cold), the empty scrambled eggs container wasn't refilled, both coffee machines ran out of supplies, as did several of the juices. It seems that there wasn't anybody actually responsible for telling the numerous waiting staff what needed to be done. The hotel does have some great possibilities with its excellent location adjacent to the Freidrichstrasse s-bahn and u-bahn stations, but much needs to be done before they can legitimately charge guests the rates available given the shortcomings that urgently need to be addressed by management.", "Date": "May 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tel Aviv, Israel", "Title": "\u201c3 Stars Hotel at best...\u201d", "Author": "CustomerFromIsrael", "ReviewID": "UR106304158", "Content": "First of all, The hotel is very hard to find by car or by walking, there are no signs and we couldn't find the address and neither could the dozens of locals we asked for help.

The rooms are very nice but are made of wood and it seems you can hear all your neighbours steps and moves and even when people are walking outside the corridor you hear them very loudly. Suprisingly the you can't hear the train outside so that's a plus. The breakfast is boring and has no variation, we spent 8 nights in the hotel and they served the exact things each time and it wasn't much. Also, the breakfast room is small considering the amount of guests and it is always crowded. Service is Mediocre at best and it seems most employees are Spanish and speak only spanish and a litlle german (Very bad english). Room Service is overpriced and meals are small and not satisfying.

Many of Berlin's attractions are within walking distance. Unfortunately, this is the end of my positive feedback. The hotel was opened only two weeks before my stay, so much was still not running smoothly and in no way corresponds to the advertised 5 stars. It started when I was trying to enter the hotel, with the automatic revolving door not working. At the reception, it seems only native Spaniards are working (the hotel is part of a Spanish chain - all the labels in the hotel are also written in Spanish, in addition to German and English), whose German skills certainly need some improvement, at least if it goes beyond simple vocabulary. That may also be the reason for the lack of courtesy. The check-in was rather slow and inefficient. Since my reservation was not listed in the computer, the employee disappeared in the back office for 10 minutes and left me waiting - without a word of apology for the waiting time. The rooms are nice and stylish, but too conservative for my taste. As the hotel was fully booked, they put me in a room accessible for the handicapped, with a bathroom that simply must be described as bad design. The sink was small and had almost no storage space and no towel holder next to it. The towels were hanging in the shower, so they already got wet during showering. The worst is the shower itself, which is not completely separated from the rest of the bathroom - between the door and glass wall was an opening of approx. 50 cm through which the water from the horizontal massage jets of the shower panel flooded the entire bathroom. The second major problem was the cleanliness. The surfaces of the room's furniture were covered with dust and lint, with piles of it under the bed. Also the carpet on the corridor was covered with lint. Apparently the hotel has not been cleaned properly since it\u2019s opening. The daily room cleaning was limited to making beds and changing towels. They did not dust, clean the floor or the bathroom or empty the trash. Other shortcomings: In the gym there were no towels and disinfectant to remove the sweat of the previous user. The room was too hot - without a chance to drink a glass of water. The lockers in the spa area were all locked although only a few guests were present. Therefore, towels and personal items had to be put on the floor or taken along in the pool or the sauna. Quite OK (though not exceptional) was the breakfast. However, the breakfast room is designed much too small, so it can get pretty loud and crowded when the hotel is fully occupied. Overall, I can only hope that many of the shortcomings are due to start-up problems and are eliminated over time. Besides the good location, you can currently find many better alternatives in Berlin, also in the 4 star category.", "Date": "April 26, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Eurostars Berlin Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d2018551-Reviews-Eurostars_Berlin_Hotel-Berlin.html", "Price": "$131 - $288*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Friedrichstrasse 99</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10117</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "2018551", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/7d/8a/7d8a87f72dba9744979523440a6ca08d2large.jpg"}}
