The Marriott at the airport looks really nice, but the prices reflect that. Aloft is the W Hotel chain's budget brand and it's the first time I had stayed in one. This place was clean, modern, stylish, and quite comfortable. The room was well laid out with a really nice bathroom and dressing area. The sleeping area had a nice large TV, big windows, only one little desk and chair but that's ok for a quick stay. I guess the ONLY annoyance was that the bright light of the Sheraton hotel sign nearby glowed into our room, but the window shades blocked that out. The lobby bar looked nice, and there's a take-out cafe where we got breakfast - the bagel sandwich was delicious. A shuttle between the terminal and the hotel runs every fifteen minutes and only takes about 5 minutes to make the trip.

Room was clean, modern, and with a comfortable bed. Bathroom is modern. Sliding floor to ceiling mirror is the door which separates the toillet / shower stall from the rest of the bathroom. No bathtub. Fine by me. I take showers. Great sound insulation. I didn't hear any planes. The one area it does falter is the lack of a restaurant. It's got this 24/7 self-serve style snack bar. They serve a hot breakfast there, but I can't comment on it. Didn't eat there. If taking the shuttle to the hotel, then you're kind of stuck with this only dining option.

Pros: -Gorgeous lobby and bar area, very trendy with calming tones. -Staff very friendly and welcoming. Fast check-in. -Chic rooms with simple European design, sure to please those with a modern taste. -Everything was clean. -Nice LG 37\" LCD TV with ~50 channels (no HD), including commercial-free movie channel 60. -Great soundproofing of windows, planes are a modest hum even on the top (5th) floor. Would only disturb the highly-sensitive sleeper who should be using earplugs anyway. -Blinds black out the room 100%, light will never interrupt your sleep here. -Nice in-room lighting system. -Free internet and Ipod/camera hookups to TV. -In-room safe. -Bed is a bit firmer than most, but relatively comfortable. -Close to airport/AMT train system to downtown Montreal. The infrequent yet efficient AMT takes 20 minutes, 4 stops total, goes directly to the Bell Centre and costs $4.25 each way (pay for zone 1). -All rooms include a quiet stainless steel mini-fridge. -Contrary to prior feedback, the silent vintage alarm clock made no ticking noise. -Wonderful shower with stylish tiling (pressure a bit weak for water conservation) and logical pump system for shampoo/douche to reduce waste. Plush towels. -Indoor pool/fitness and and public area was very well-maintained. -Express check-out. Cons: -Biggest issue: soundproofing of entry door to hallway/adjoining rooms. 1\" gap at bottom of door doesn't help. With the hotel only 30% full, still woke at 4.20am to a loud conversation and repeated door slams from a room two doors down. Problem is augmented by the acoustics of the room with cement ceiling/walls. -Thermostat not very reliable. Was 16 upon entry, upon setting to 20, it wouldn't turn on. Had to set to 23 to get it going and the room was blazing hot within 30 minutes. Reset back to 20 and woke up cold with a sore throat, as it evidently shut off for the night. -Bar was closed by 11pm, even on the weekend. -Beds and sink are very low, impractical for anyone over 5'10\". -Two pillows provided on king bed are large, spongy and cylinder-shaped. Very uncomfortable, as they prop your head up to a 90-degree angle, hard on the neck. The two normal thin rectangular pillows were hidden above the curtain in the bathroom area. -Only in-room chair is the low-back work desk chair with minimal tilt-back, thus no relaxing recline chair for the evening (could have one on far side of the room). -In-room coffee packets are tiny and bland. -Walls are devoid of any artwork. One colorful print would really help. -Bill under door upon check-out was 90% in French, though I could figure out it has express check-out if you agree with all charges, including $10/day parking. Not directly their fault, but note: -Tons of construction in the area, the misaligned roads and poor signage make it awkward to get to even with a GPS.

When I traveled to Montreal recently, I was excited to stay at the new W concept - Aloft - which seems like a cheaper version of the W experience. Yes. and No. Bliss amenities are nice. Beds are comfortable enough, and the general atmosphere of the lobby is good. But here's the downside - the \"loft\" concept means lots of hard surfaces and high ceilings - resulting in a loud hotel room that honestly feels more like a combination dorm room/cheap Ikea knockoff. Service is reasonable, but unlike other hotels of the same ilk, offers a very limited menu. The hotel also does not have a business center, which posed a bit of a problem when I needed to print out a presentation (the woman at the front desk offered to print it for me if I emailed it to her, but the size of my presentation did not allow for it). And the springlike pillows (and general hotel noise) ensured a poor night's sleep. So, for the general Aloft concept - I'm not a fan. I could probably get beyond that if this specific hotel was exceptional in service or cleanliness, but the wear and tear of this place was surprising, given the age of the hotel. My room had stained and torn carpets, walls full of dings and dents, torn furniture and the housekeepers' hair on the counters.

The rooms would definitely be described as oversized with generous bathrooms. The showers were just what you need on a short business trip and its worth mentioning it was a full stand up, not a tub.

The fridge, free water and complimentary magazines were nice touches that showed they wanted you to feel at home. Down at the bar, it was definitely more of a lounge. There is a long bar you can sit at thats very inviting with a backlit shelf area making for a very chic ambiance. But there is also a large number of tables, couches, sectionals and chairs so you can relax however you want! They have a small menu of finger foods that hit the spot with a few cocktails! The attention to detail on the drinks was also truly impressive. The bartender (Karen, I believe) got to know us on a first name basis and she truly rivaled bartenders at even the most upscale bars I've visited in Montreal. I just ordered a cosmo, and have to say its the best I've had. For a drink so common, its hard to make one stand out! Just outside the bar was a patio area that even looked inviting in the evening. That was also connected to a well equipped gym and a beautiful pool. Around the pool was all wood finishing and it smelled much more natural than the usual chlorine smell that greets you. Another reminder that they want you to truly feel at home. For a departure from your typical hotel, I would highly recommend the Aloft.

This time we had a king room. The room is efficient, and the bed was very comfortable. The room was basically the same as the double room I had at the aLoft in Phoenix. It has what I call \"Ikea-esque\" furniture, and that is fine with me. Open shelves, everything is built in, LOTS of outlets and none are behind furniture. It also has a cube fridge. The bathroom has a sliding door to seperate the sink area from the shower/toilet area, and has a cool frosted full-length window between the shower and the bedroom area. The frosted window does allow some vision into the shower, so I would be sure I was staying there with a close friend! In a double bed room, the shower window is smaller, so the \"visual ability\" is less. It is nice to have the light going into the shower/bathroom. The biggest difference between the double room and the king room is that the king room is just generally smaller. In some hotels, a king room is the same size as a duble, with more space around the bed and maybe a chair or something, but in the aLoft, the king room is just smaller. In the double, the bathroom vanity was very long and spacious and in the living area the couch and desk area is longer. In the king, the vanity and closet area are an OK size, just not as big as in the double.

We found the most reliable method was to cut through the lot of the adjacent Wyndham coming off the airport access road. The Aloft was a one night stay for me, two for my colleague. We had a car so were free to get meals where we liked (Schwartz's Deli and Bar-B-Barn respectively). The Canteen near the check in desk is quite limited in selection while premium in pricing. Please refer to the posted pictures as they tell most of the story. The property feels new with very European styling. I haven't traveled too, too, extensively but I was reminded of Euro-chic styled hotels I've stayed in in Germany and Austria. This was especially true of the shower with it's Gel soap and Shampoo dispensers in place of a bath soap bar and little bottle of Shampoo. The room was compact but efficient so that I didn't really feel cramped at all. The flat screen TV on the wall opposite the bed was huge, 42-inch(?) and had digital capability. However, only the in-house channels were digital, broadcast channels were all Analog - too bad. The bed was interesting, it was King width but seemed regular length. Not a problem for me, but taller guests may miss that extra 6-8 inches that are normally part of a Queen or King size bed. Check out the retro-styled Big Ben bedside alarm clock, for me it showed attention to detail in implementing the concept. One of the more interesting/unique features of the room was a 'black box' on the desk with room for you iPod/iPad/portable media device and DVI/VGA/Composite Video inputs. I never got to try this out but presume that it was connected to the Flat Screen TV. Again, see the accompanying photos. For those of you used to conventional closets, the shallow recess behind a curtain might take getting used to. For me, it's also consistent with the Euro efficiency styling of the room. Actually, I kind of missed the slot near the door where the key card usually needs to be placed to get the room lights on. One grumble about the room, the desk lighting is terrible. It's nice to be able to look out the window when at the desk but in order to work with a laptop the curtain must be pulled down almost all the way, and the desk lamp turned on. It ended up making the workspace a bit of a dark cave. Finally, in passing, I took photos of the pool and exercise room. I'm sorry that I didn't get to use the fitness equipment or the pool as both seemed inviting. I spent a couple of moments in the Courtyard and wished that I had a bit more time to enjoy that space too.

We also requested a cot, but were told that they were not available because the clientele of the hotel is more business-oriented. I asked, jokingly, if it would then be more advisable to bring my secretary than my children, and was told that it was. The decor and the amenities in the room all speak to this being a man's hotel, from the flat-screen television to the \"fake closet\" as my daughter called it, to the lack of a restaurant (only an overpriced grab-and-go section with lots of peppers in the food in the lobby) but an impressive bar. The beds were stiff and large, and the covers were difficult to maneuver. The decor in the room was, well, odd - for example, a purposefully plasticky retro alarm clock and colorblocked blinds; fake plush panels behind the bed of cork, and, in one room, cow fur; a prominent recycling bin but only a pithy, small garbage bin in the bathroom. Despite how unflattering the above may be, it's not a bad hotel. It's just not for families.

The rooms were clean, the staff was very friendly, and the decor is nice. But they try so hard to be \"funky, hip and cool\" that they lose the ability to be practical. Some examples for you. They place the face cloths in the sink area, and the hand towels in the shower area. Then, once I fetch a hand towel, I have no place to hang it up in the sink area. It ends up lying on the counter beside the sink. The \"closet\" to hang up your clothes consists of a 10 inch bar at a 45 degree angle and little knobs down the bar to catch the hangars. It looks nice and takes up very little room, but try using it! It's impossible to manage the cloths on this bar. And finally, you're going to shake your head at me for this, but you know how all hotels give you a pad of paper and a pen to write with? Well here they still give you the paper, but instead of a pen they give you a pencil. Yah, a pencil. Try writting a postcard with a pencil and then mailing it. All these things are meant to be inline with the brand, but I didn't care for it. Plus, there was a problem with the bill (1 night stay with no incidentals, and they make a mistake). It was taken care of, but it was just another frustration I had to deal with 5 minutes before the shuttle leaves. Oh, and that's another thing. The shuttle. If you stay here, DO NOT stand at the \"hotel shuttle\" post outside the airport. They don't stop here (after 20 minutes of waiting I figured it out). They stop at post #2 called \"Parking and Via Rail\" and arrive about every 15 minutes or so. There is a free phone beside the baggage claim to the hotel. There is coffee in your room, but only enough to make 1 cup of regular coffee, or one cup of decaf. You may have to share. And one last thing, do your research for food. Their selection is very limited and quite expensive. We ended up eating at the airport on arrival and departure days. Sorry so negative here when the other posts are so possitive.

BLISS bath amenities. Wall mounted TV (only english channel is CNN). There is a nice indoor pool and courtyard with contemporary furniture. The biggest downfall to this hotel was location. It's SUPER convenient to the airport, but a disaster for everything else. You CANNOT walk ANYWHERE since it is pretty much locked in by freeway ramps. No restaurants to walk to....I had to order pizza. You can take their shuttle to a crappy mall with a supermarket and some decent food (I ate at Thai Express) and to the VIA Rail station. The bus into Montreal city leaves from an adjacent station next to VIA Rail. MAKE SURE YOU KNOW HOW TO FIND AND USE THE BUS!!!! I CAN NOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH!!!

Pros: -good value for money -new with modern design -free internet usage (wireless), 2 terminals available in the lobby -quiet despite being next to the airport -large flat TV in the room -bright shower with good water pressure and consistent water temperature -good service upon check-in Cons: -no cups in the room, just foam cups -AC was on the loud side -parking at $10 (was not aware of this at time of booking) -I was not offered an official receipt at time of checkout (I prepaid online) -can easily hear our neighbors partying -would be nice to have an extra chair in the room (there was only 1 at the desk) For those who want to sleep pass 8.30am, remember to stay out your DND sign out. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as I would be checking out at 9.30 and therefore had the maid knocking on the door starting at 8.30am and every 20 mins thereafter. Even though my list of cons is as long as my list of pros, I will be back again because it really is a nice hotel with very good price.", "Date": "August 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rochester Hills, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cPerfect stay in Montreal!\u201d", "Author": "dal-n-lana", "ReviewID": "UR17643909", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the aloft for 3 nights. We were very impressed with the aloft. It is brand new and has a contemporary feel. Since it's new, it's very clean and that means a lot to us. We booked at SPG.com and got a Starpicks rate @ $89 per night since we booked just days before arriving. Four star hotels in the city were going for $170+, so being outside the city for $89 was well worth the savings. We would drive into the city in the morning and stay until night. If you require to be \"in-and-out\" of your room throughout the day, I wouldn't recommend staying outside the city. The lobby is very welcoming and does not have the overwhelming \"club\" feel of a W hotel, but it is chic and modern. The room is a loft style, duh, and the layout is very optimal with high ceilings. Other details include a comfortable bed, 42 inch flat screen, free wireless internet, iron, and Bliss bathroom products. Being close to the airport did not significantly increase airplane noise. However, hallway noise can heard easily, so hopefully you don't have loud neighbors. The toilet/shower has a door separating it from the mirror/sink. But the sink is open to room, actually behind the bed. So it can be noisy for someone that is sleeping when another is using the bathroom. The hotel does not have many frills like butler service, mini bar, 5* restaurant, but you might not need that anyway, so you shouldn't pay for it. It does have a pool, outdoor deck, pool table, and offers free car wash. They give you a bucket with soapy water and a sponge and you can wash your own car. We arrived by car from the west. If you're driving, check Google Maps or call the hotel for directions before you go. The airport is big and the streets can be confusing. The drive to the city center is about 15-25 minutes depending on traffic. There is not a good option for public transportation from the hotel to the city. You'll have to take a taxi to a bus station, then a bus to a metro. That trip could take you 45-60 minutes and cost $10 for the taxi and $2.75 per person each way for the bus/metro. We found good parking on Berri street under the new library. It costs $10 for 24 hours and $7 for 24 hours on weekends. Parking in the business area is about $20 for 24 hours. The walk from Berri to the old town is just 10 minutes and to the business/shopping area just 20 minutes. The other advantage to having the car is that you can drive around the city and experience things at your own pace. With our 3 day stay, we drove to Quebec City for one day and had enough time to see highlights of both cities. In summary, the hotel was awesome. The location was okay, but worth it for the price.

The idea seems to be to offer a lower cost version of the W hotels but what you end up with is a hipper Four Points by Sheraton. The hotel is indeed very stylish, from the lobby to the rooms and bathrooms. The rooms were dead quiet despite being right by the airport and the blackout shades for the windows worked great. There were several things, though, that didn't quiet gel. The bed itself is rather firm, the sheets were scratchy and the pillows were not feather. There is a great flatscreen TV and a place to plug in your iPod, but no radio or even a CD player. When I called the lobby and asked how I could go about hearing some music they suggested purchasing a music channel via the TV. There is a bar but no restaurant on site, just sandwiches from the self-service center. You can go across the parking lot to the Hilton, though, and eat there. If they think through some more of the practical needs of a traveler and focus less on the style, the concept could be successful.", "Date": "July 5, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Aloft Montreal Airport", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g155032-d1027281-Reviews-Aloft_Montreal_Airport-Montreal_Quebec.html", "Price": "$124 - $180*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">500 McMillan Blvd</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Montreal</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">Quebec</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">H9P0A2</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Canada</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1027281", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/85/95/85952267027acd24d8cfabbb65ceb0af7large.jpg"}}
