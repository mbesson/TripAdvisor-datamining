I chose HI Express for miles, location, and price. From the hotel, you cannot take a standard shuttle fair not he Toronto Express shuttle. This is a little annoying because they charge extra for a \"connector\" service. On the return, I just walked to Sheraton Center and took the shuttle from there for a little discount. Probably not a good option with a lot of luggage, though. The service of the hotel was quite good. I had a good check-in experience and they actually called a few minutes after I arrived in my room to make sure there were no problems. They put me on the top floor and although the window is small, there is actually a decent view of some of the city skyline. Breakfast was fine as for a business style hotel. They have a pancake machine, which is interesting. I did not try it, but it looked like fun. Standard yogurt, bread, mass produced eggs, and bacon/sausage available. My sleep was fine. I did not notice any noise problems and the bed was comfortable. There is a nice desk and couch as well for working from the room if necessary. The free internet works fine. I had a problem with the bath stopper, which didn't work when I had some back pain. I called down and they tried to fix it, but couldn't so they gave me a new room. They were very good about fixing the problem by providing a different room. After changing rooms, I fixed two other problems. My TV was also messed up (not providing good quality or all the stations), and the fan was making too much noise. My advice - if you have a problem with the room, be sure to tell them and get a new room. In general, the hotel could use with an update to the TV and some minor repairs in the rooms and other areas. Even the elevator buttons were falling off. Problems: - The location is not the best. I was actually surprised because I thought it was a good spot, but it seems a few blocks away from major shopping/dining areas. I actually felt a little uncomfortable at night because there were not a lot of people around and most of the neighborhood looked closed. A few places were open for eating, but it seemed a bit limited. For those new to Toronto, it might be good to walk around in the daylight to get your bearings before venturing out for a place to eat at night. This may be due to my own bias, coming from Japan, where I never feel uncomfortable and there are people everywhere in the cities. It could be perfectly safe, and my cultural bias makes it more uncomfortable for me. - No refrigerator in the room. This is something I dislike. - No safe in the room. I have seen how cleaning staff leave all the rooms wide open during their cleaning schedules in most hotels. I do not trust that someone can just walk in and take stuff. I like to have a safe in the room. I used the safe in the lobby, but they required a $50 deposit in case of a lost key ($100 lost key charge). It is also a small safe box, so you cannot store larger items like computer products. Overall, the hotel experience was adequate, but nothing I would get excited about for future visits. I would probably try to find someplace else to stay for a similar price if it were possible. Unfortunately, I am not sure that it is possible. So, for this price, maybe this is the best you can get.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxfordshire, England", "Title": "\u201cDelighted!\u201d", "Author": "malhen", "ReviewID": "UR126390305", "Content": "We were looking for an affordable, clean and well-run hotel near the centre of Toronto, with breakfast!

We were put up at the Holiday Inn Express on Lombard Street in downtown Toronto, and while I didn't have high expectations for the HIE, I was pleasantly surprised. The location is absolutely ideal. We were within easy walking distance of countless shops, restaurants, and bars, and thanks to the $20/day parking (a steal in a major city), we had easy access to our rental car to reach more out-of-the-way locations. The room is basic and clean. The bed is more comfortable than I anticipated, and the view was great from our 12th floor room. It would be nice if the windows had light-blocking curtains rather than double sheers, but that's simply being nitpicky. It certainly didn't ruin our trip! The free wi-fi is a great hotel perk, though it can be quite slow, noted particularly when trying to video chat with family back home. The bathroom is spacious and clean, the tub larger than a standard, the towels softer than many other hotels I've stayed in. The free breakfast is great, especially if you're looking to cut corners and save. There's absolutely no need to pay for breakfast elsewhere when the HIE serves eggs, breakfast meat, pancakes, muffins, bagels, toast, fruit, cereal, juices, teas, coffees, milk, and more. We had a hearty breakfast and didn't even need lunch - we just had an early dinner around 4:30 and were quite content. There's some hallway noise and street noise, but nothing that was enough to keep us awake or be terribly disturbing. Our stay was wonderful, and my husband was happy to have a cozy little place to call home during his business trip.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Key West, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat night in Toronto\u201d", "Author": "mboyle", "ReviewID": "UR125543407", "Content": "I booked three rooms at htis hotel.

King or Queen Subway stations not too far away but mostly just walked around the city. There was a wait upon check-in as the hotel staff were doing there best to accommodate different hotel guests, but after that everything was fine.

The food was basic but very adequate and there was a good range of choice including cereals, breads, pancakes, fruit, yoghurts and cooked food as well.

The room had free wifi access which was very useful to me, but if you don't have a laptop there is a computer in reception you can use. When I checked out the reception guy said I owed $3.99 for the bottle of water in my room, which I hadn't opened and which was still in the bathroom. I told him I hadn't used the water and he just said, \"okay then, no problem\" and that was that! I thought this was a bit strange, and wondered what was going on there, but nothing major.

After getting the elevator up to my room, there was no mini-bar or even a free bottle of water (this seems to be standard in hotels when you are playing close to $200/night). So, I called the front desk to see if I could order a pizza to be delivered. I called the front desk 4 times in 60 minutes and no one answered. It was before midnight and also one of the busiest weekends in Toronto, so I was surprised there was no one manning the desk, even tho it was late. The TV was from the 80's, huge and didn't have great reception. Also, the elevators were broken, so I had to walk 16 flights down to the lobby with no real apology or explanation from the front desk.

Now for the downsides: there is nothing \"luxurious\" about this hotel (but as I said it's clean), the A/C and heating systems don't have a thermostat (you have to turn it on and off manually...which stinks when you're hot/cold in the middle of the night), no fridge in the room (not a deal breaker, but something I've come to expect). Back to the location: There are lots of great bars/restaurants on Front street (2-3 blocks away, walk down Jarvis St to get there). There is an \"interesting\" bar on the first floor called \"Laide\". It's definately worth going to with your spouse/partner because of its \"uniquely adult\" theme, but I wouldn't take any business associates there. As I mentioned, the nearest subway station is Queen/Yonge (about 3-4 blocks away), which will get you to the airport or to various sightseeing spots for $2.50 each way. Eaton center is also at Queen/Yonge which is a great shopping mall and connects to the PATH, a 20+ mile underground tunnel system you can take to get to places like CN tower (very nice when it's cold out). We didn't have any problems with the hotel staff. They didn't seem to know the area that well, but they were friendly and tried to help us when they could.

Easy to find and get to. Located in a safe neighborhood, close to the St. Lawrence market. A small courtyard is in front of this hotel, and a convenience store and gas station across the street. St James Park is right next door, and the church bells can be heard ringing on Sunday morning. The park is a very pleasant one to walk by. Parking could be difficult on a busy Saturday night. We arrived after a nightmarish 13 hour drive, to discover that the parking garage was full. The front desk did direct where parking could be found - down the street at a public lot or further down at another hotel. Clearly they did note my distress at the thought of even telling my husband we'd have to drive even further just to park. Luckily, the garage attendant did stop at the desk at that moment and let the staff know that two more spaces had become available. We accepted one with sincere gratitude. Parking was $20 a night, which we have found is on average with other hotels in the city and other major cities. The room was a decent size. It could have used a bit more counter room in the bathroom, but overall adequate. The closet/TV/drawer combination is interesting - the only negative was the closet was dark, and the light above it wasn't quite positioned correctly so you could see inside. Beds were excellent. Carpet in the hallway did have a big stain on it on our floor but otherwise the place was well kept. Laundry can be found right next to the the front desk area. You'll need to get tokens from the front desk as opposed to using your own coins. Its just a single washer/dryer stackable so plan accordingly. Nice counter for folding laundry. Breakfast is one of the biggest conveniences in staying at this hotel. You'll find many hotels don't necessarily have a place to eat and you'll have to find a Second Cup or Tim Hortons's every morning. The breakfast area was apparently not part of the original design. We were glad we looked it over the night before. You'll see the one side with all of the food along one wall that juts in and out, and tables across. Then if you take note - there is another room on the side of the elevators that appears larger - which has a coffee station and tables. This was our preferred location to eat breakfast - less crowded. The food was good, hot and well replenished. The two coffee stations made a big difference getting breakfast out quickly. The hot cinnamon rolls are always the best part. Reasonably close to King or Queen stations on Yonge. We chose this location to be near the Mill Street Brewery and it was an reasonable walk to the Distillery District, with great choices in dining.

The boat tour around the island (well actually only to one bit of the island) is okay a nice view of Toronto from out there.

Also, within walking distance was the Central Train Station for Amtrak and VIA Rail Canada and the huge Eaton Shopping Center. I stayed in room 601.

I booked 3 rooms and asked for them all to be near eachother since there was a group of 12 of us going down. I called and cancelled the 3rd room because it was no longer needed. I asked to get the price for the other 2 rooms and all of a sudden the price was about $30 more per room then I was quoted when I originally booked. Okay, no big deal, I guess the first girl forgot to tell me that parking was $25 and every extra person was $10... No biggy, at least I still had 2 rooms booked. So when we arrived at the hotel I went to check in the 2 rooms (this was at about 7pm) and I was told that I only had one reserved. I was furious. I was told that when I called and cancelled the one room that I actually cancelled 2 rooms. I was also told that it MUST have been a mistake on my end. I let them know that I had all my confirmation numbers and everything. They found me another room (as if they were doing me some kind of favour). The rooms were only 6 floors away from eachother, but again no biggy right? We were also informed that upon checking in that there was no parking left and they we would have to park down the street. I was told that check-in was at 3pm and that is why there was not parking... OKAY. We parked down the street, it turned out to be cheaper then parking at the hotel anyways. The rooms were clean and comfortable. They were both very small but for the price one can't complain. The proximity to the club district was perfect. You are close to shopping and everything, which is great for cabbing and walking. Over all, I would book here again for the simple fact that it is cheap and close to everything. My only advice would be to make sure you print out all you confirmation numbers and take them with you. (especailly on busy weekends like Caribana, I was lucky they found me a room at all, or actually they were lucky!! lol) Dont bother parking at the hotel, you can save $10 if you walk a block.", "Date": "August 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Devon", "Title": "\u201cMixed feelings\u201d", "Author": "seashellseeker", "ReviewID": "UR8068803", "Content": "We stayed here for two nights, as our previous hotel (Novotel) was booked up for the Gay Pride event.

We booked two rooms each with one Queen and small sofa. Our rooms were very large. We had plenty of room. For the price ($117 Canadian per night + taxes) this was a great find. I did notice some floors were being renovated so perhaps that is why the previous poster had a bad room. The continental breakfast was very good considering it was included in the room price. It was very busy both Saturday and Sunday morning. Choices included cinanmon buns, boiled eggs, white and brown toast, muffins, bagels, cereal, bananas, apples and oranges, coffee, milk (skim and 2%) and orange and apple juice. We ate breakfast there both mornings. We found the neighbourhood very safe. There is a salvation army one block over as well as a youth hostel but we did not see any vagrants loitering and we walked to and from the Keg Restaurant on Friday night (returned about 10:30pm) and felt very safe. There is a 24 hour Dominion store (grocery store) about a 3 minute walk from the hotel as well as a Second Cup and other small restaurants. The Laurence market and farmer's market is about a 7 minute walk from the hotel. You could walk to the Eaton's centre or the CN Tower but it might be a bit of a hike. We cabbed to and from the CN tower and it cost $8.00 each way. We parked in the garage ($11 Canadian per day) and it didn't seem dirty but I wasn't really looking. The hotel staff were helpful although I would not buy anything in the little convenience store in the lobby - too expensive. Walk down the street to the grocery store. One thing - if you are a light sleeper the bells in the church nearby start ringing around 6:30am and that can be a bit annoying. Overall we were very happy with this hotel. I think you will find it difficult to find anything else in the same price range, same fairly central location, and same level of cleanliness. It is certainly not the Sheraton but unless you gamble with hotwire you probably won't get the Sheraton for $117 per night.
