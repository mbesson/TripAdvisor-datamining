My Husband and I needed an affordable place to stay while visiting the Seattle area. Pulled up to the curb, easy for unloading. The lobby was retro, with lovely furniture, and the desk gal was friendly and super sweet. We checked out a couple rooms, and decided to upgrade, which was not a problem. The nice down comforters and folded stuffed animal towels made the place even nicer. We had dinner in the lounge, and it was fabulous. They even have juke box and pool tables. Starbucks in right down the street, and we visited the public market, which was two blocks away. I would highly recommend this hotel, especially if you want to be near the Public Market and City Center. Everything was in walking distance. Parking wasn't a problem either. They have a deal with a garage within walking distance. So we took advantage of that for our two night stay.

I wanted a hotel that I could get to easily by rail from the airport, and the Moore fit the bill. The rooms are spacious and very clean. Our room had a bit of a view of Pikes Market and the waterfront. The front desk is extremely helpful, Robert and Tracy were awesome! They helped with bus schedules, restaurant recommendations, and loads of general Seattle information. The room was a bit chilly, but the front desk was quick to offer extra blankets, so we were very comfortable. Even though the rooms do not have a small refrigerator, I bought some cheese at Pikes that the staff was kind enough to store for a couple of days in their refrigerator :-) We were not interested in a hotel with a fitness center or big restaurant, so the Moore was a great option for saving a bit on the room rate so we could enjoy more activities. I would definitely recommend it to my friends and I will stay there again.

My advice:don't do it people, just don't. Go for a brand name hotel, and pay a little more. That way, if something goes horribly wrong, you may have a shot at getting some kind of resolution. This is a true story, swear to God: my husband went to wipe himself off with a towel-twice while taking a shower and both of the towels had fe..s on them. Yes, fe..s. He flipped out and took the towels to the front desk. The manager was not there, and upon checking out, I explained to the girl at the front desk that not only was this appalling, but dangerous. Particularly to my one month old baby. I also told her, that I did not feel like I should pay for our stay there. I did pay though (Dumb. In retrospect, I should not have), because I just thought I would settle this with the manager later. My thought was the manager would listen to what happened to us, and act appropriately. That didn't happen. I emailed \"Mike\", the manager, then followed up with a phone call. He basically called m a liar, said that \"never in my career have I ever heard of something like this\", to which I replied, \"Well I haven't heard of anything like this either in all my years of traveling, but this really did happen.\" He then proceeded to give me the third degree about where the towels were located, when this happened blah blah, etc. It was very apparent that he felt that this was some creative attempt on my family's part to get a refund. God, what a jerk. I am POed all over again just writing this. I asked for a refund, he said no, then I told him that I would need to file a complaint with the BBB. He then said, \"Go ahead! I don't care, you can threaten me all you want!\" Uh, no Mike this isn't personal, just horrendous customer service. Like, on very level imaginable. Whatever. I told him, fine.

That is very convenient. The parking issue is a royal pain in the butt and I thought there must be internet or something in the lobby because it always seemed full in the morning (no internet elsewhere its just an old building) but discovered Sunday morning everyone was sitting around because the parking garage didn't open until 9am. Glad I didn't have to be anywhere! Booked months in advance and was in for a rude surprise then we checked out and they tried to charge significantly more than the agreed price. There is another place nearby with significantly more to offer for much less but I dig \"historic\". I don't dig surprises. Eventually the manager made good but it was after I got home. The restaurant next door turned the music up LOUD one night as if to tell my group GET OUT as soon as we sat down. That was fine, there's an Irish pub on the back side of the block (not the douchey one down by the market place) that had excellent food at excellent prices and the nicest staff we've ever encountered in downtown Seattle. If the other place hadn't chased us off we'd never have found the good place. The Moore doesn't even know what the word amenity means. What you get is a very clean room with a small TV and in our case a great view. There is nothing else, no fridge, coffee or microwave. The cleaning staff is terrific (cleaned our room twice one day which was funny and sweet). It was November so it was cold. There is no A/C and we don't think the heat ever came on in the 3 days we were there. Waking up at the crack of dawn and searching for breakfast was quite the adventure. The coffee shop next door (adjacent to the lobby) is terrific. The new owners are great. It kept the cloying damp at bay and prevented me from melting down when I discovered our car was being held hostage after we'd moved all our stuff downstairs and given up the room key.

I telephoned the hotel in a panic, and a staff member jumped in his car and tracked me down at the pier, jogged up to me with a cheerful smile and my parka in hand, and tried to refuse the money I offered him in compensation for his time, trouble, and expense.

The real insanity started at about 1am when a couple of men started arguing loudly and began threatening each other. They then began to fight in an obvious physical brawl that carried out into the hall, complete with screaming girlfriends and death threats the sounds of a bottles breaking in the room while the brawl continued out in the hall. The fight eventually de-escalated but now the drunks decided to 'talk about it' out in the hall in front of our door. The people who were still in the room decided to put on gangster rap music full blast until approx. 6 am before it stopped. My wife and I did not sleep a wink the whole night and the next morning when we approached the girl behind the desk and explain to her why we not be returning the next night - or ever for that matter - she said she is used to dealing with drunks in the halls and really enjoys yelling at them when that sort of thing happens there. The insinuation was obvious - this type of activity is not uncommon at this hotel. THIS PLACE IS A DUMP AND A DRUNKEN FLOPHOUSE!!

Right off, we had a car, so parking might have been an issue, but we always parked after 9 at night and were gone before 8 am, so on street parking was free. Otherwise there was a $12 all day parking lot very close by. We were traveling with my sister and her daughter. They were staying at the plush Sheraton for a conference. Since we were not going to be in the room alot, we didn't want to pay the $360 per night that the Sheraton was asking. Hence, we booked a room at The Moore. After dropping off my sister and her daughter at the Sheraton and seeing their plush room, coming to the Moore was shocking. It is an older type hotel - like something you'd find in an older section of Europe. when we checked in at 10:30 p.m., the lobby was dimly lit, but I did notice beautiful furniture and artwork. Also, there was a disco next door of some sort with loud music. I was just beside myself. Then we took the elevator up to the top floor for our room - again, when I switched on the lite I was grimacing. It was your very basic room. I quickly realized that it was \"dim\" because they were using CFL lightbulbs (good for them!), so it quickly got much brighter. The first night I didn't know what to expect, but we were there for four nights so I was going to make the best of it. It quickly grew on us and by the end of our stay, I downright liked it. The walls were tastefully painted, it was clean, although old. The bathroom was very clean and spacious. It had a great view out the window. It was not hot or stuffy. The exterior hallways had nice artwork and were clean. And every night when we came back to our room, we couldn't wait to see what new animal shape the maid had created out of our towels and left them artfully on our very comfy bed. Yes, maid service! My sister didn't even get that at the Sheraton!. So, even though a bit shocking start, we really liked this hotel, the location was fabulous (although it is in a so-so neighborhood, so caution is in order), parking was easy and everything turned out fine.

The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about restaurants, shopping, and must-see attractions in Seattle. Location was ideal. Everything I wanted to see was in walking distance. For example, it is just a few blocks from Pike Place Market. However, down the block from the hotel was a drug rehab-salvation-army-type shelter place, where support groups met.

The front desk person told us that it came on automatically at a certain time but it never came on at all for us. The sheets were thin and barely large enough for the bed so they slid off the corners all night. There was a closet but not one hanger to be found. The elevator was so small that if you had luggage you had to wait until there was no one else using it in order to have enough room to bring up your things.

The rooms are bare and old, yes, but very clean. The cleaning staff even makes towel animals like they do on cruise ships - a small but thoughtful gesture for a minimally staffed hotel. My only \"complaint\" is that the bathroom is VERY small, which wasn't a problem for me but if you're claustrophobic I would not stay here. Things I didn't know before staying there: the hotel offers free Wi-Fi in the lobby though it's not advertised so you should ask the receptionist. In addition, it is a historic hotel and is next to The Moore Theater. Both of which were featured in a little walking food tour we did, so be sure to check out the theater, I hear it's beautiful on the inside! Bottom line: If you don't care too much about hotel amenities and are just traveling to explore the city, then the Moore provides a perfect place to sleep and have easy access to downtown Seattle.

We stayed a couple nights over the summer and found it to be okay, if not great. Our room seemed reasonably clean, but the furnishings and facilties are clearly old. By old, I don't mean 1980's old - the hotel was built in 1907. That said, we had reasonable expecations and we were comfortable enough. The view of the Space Needle from the fire escape was also pretty amazing. Whether you enjoy the Moore or not depends mostly on you. If you're used to cheap places with a backpacker / hostel feel, you'll fit right in at the Moore. If you generally choose the Hyatt, you should probably avoid it. I would also avoid the Moore if I were extremely safety-conscious. This is not the building I would want to be sleeping in during an earthquake or a fire. Our biggest inconvenience was parking. We were in town for a couple weeks and had a car and a lot of stuff. We ended up paying a fairly hefty rate to stay at a skeevy parking garage down the street. By the time we wrestled the luggage up and down a (very dodgy) parking garage stairwell a few times, I started to suspect we might have been better off staying somewhere else. Bottom line, if you're travelling light and cheap and want a good downtown location, the Moore is probably a good choice. If you have a car to park, or a lot of luggage, or you tend to like newer places, get on Priceline or Hotwire and check out their deals on chain hotels.

Parking is hard to come by anywhere down town in Seattle, so the Moore is no exception. Plan on paying for parking; use the parkade across the street. It gets locked up at night, and since crime is a big issue in down town Seattle it will just give you that little extra piece of mind that your car is locked away. Parking will cost you $20.00 per day in the parkade. Lobby: Once you step inside, you are greeted with a marbled reception like area. Friendly staff to check you in promptly and help with any questions or concerns. The building has a very outdated elevator, something that is par for the course considering the age of the building. The hallways (corridors) are extremely wide. Something you just do not see, it was refreshing. Rooms: There are two types of rooms available in this hotel.

Even though it's next to a theatre, The Moore Theatre, I'm not sure if there are actually performances. I checked it out, and the box office seemed perpetually closed. One caution though.

You can walk around all of downtown from this location. We heard of this place from Trip Advisor and it ranked high as a budget hotel. At over $100 + per night in December, wasn't precisley a budget hotel. We chose a room/suite that had kitchenette and it was room 705. Initially, we had 605 but becasue there had been smokers inthere before us, they were in the midst of fumigating the room.

Lots of space to store stuff. TV was small and had a lousy remote but again wasn't why we were there. We didn't go (but heard lots about it) was a restaurant/lounge called the Nite Life. Apparently good food and awesome drinks, the Long island Ice tea is supposed to be spectacular and they never heard of a too strong drink. We went to a few local restaurants, El Malecon, Mama's Kitchen (awesome Marg's and Elvis Presley burrito plate!!) and Ivar's Seafood buffet. Elliots looked good but the 2.5 hour wait turned us off.

I am not a super picky traveller and only really require rather basic amenities while traveling. Upon entering the Moore, one can tell it is a rather old hotel and building. The scariest thing about the hotel is its elevator, which if you have a fear of elevators, it will be brought even further to light when going up this elevator. It's creaky, small and just old but scary because of it. The room itself was nicer than I expected. It was a typical budget hotel room, with comfy beds, a nice view and a tv set. The bathroom could use a renovation and had some mildew around the shower's edges. Additionally, the shower stalls drain was extremely slow, causing some water to overflow from the shower stall and onto the bathroom floor. (Hence, probably the reason there was mildew around the shower base.) A nice touch was that the towels were all folded into shapes to create a very lovely presentation. Even the toilet paper roll was folded into a seashell shape. Overall, the stay was nice and even though we had a room that face 2nd Street, there wasn't much traffic noise at all. Additionally, there was a show at the Moore Theatre the night we stayed. However, that show seemed to end by 11 PM and even when it was occuring, there wasn't much discernable noise coming from it to our room. All that said, I was able to soundly sleep at the Moore. The hotel has great character and charm and once you get past the scary elevator, you realize just how many people have walked and stayed in these rooms.

However it was very difficult to regulate the hot water and I got scorched a couple times. The initial staff that we dealt with when checking in were very pleasant but the night clerk, Bill, is a total jerk. One of our pillows was exceptionally flat and when we came in from dinner and a show approximately 10:30pm, I asked for an additional pillow and another bath towel. Bill rolled his eyes and acted like I had asked him to jog around the block twice in his undies. As Bill complained and slammed things around in a storage area behind the desk, I told him, \"Nevermind -- I'll make due.\" He responded with a snarky, \"Yeah, I'm just going through the motions here.\" In other words, he was just pretending to look for a pillow.

The only way one could be disappointed with this place is by having unrealistic expectations. I made my reservation directly through the hotel website, choosing the $52 \"European\" queen/single adult, which turned out to be Room 711 facing the water. I checked in on Saturday afternoon, after 2:30. The room itself, the sink and the linens were all perfectly clean in appearance, feel, and smell. The tap water tasted fine, although I let it run for a while before filling my glass since it's an old building. The decor is not worth mentioning but just to be complete here it is; hodgepodge cheap motel style, which by definition is unattractive, but it wasn't remarkably ugly. There were 3 sets of towels, 4 cups and 4 bars of soap. There's no clock, but you can ask for a wakeup call, or use the TV to keep track of time (reception wasn't great on all channels, but the news & weather were fine). The toilet across the hall was a little concrete cell, but it was clean. The full bathroom right around the corner was roomy, clean, and dry. I didn't use the sink because I had one in my room, but I had no problem getting plenty of hot water for my shower. The water pressure could have been stronger, but it was adequate. I never had to wait for the toilet or the shower, nor did I have people waiting after me to use them. There were some rowdy neighbors late Saturday night, which I expected, but I'm an easy sleeper so it didn't bother me. There was some street/city noise from outside, but nothing extraordinary if you've ever lived in an urban setting. My time in the room was spent either getting ready to go out or to sleep... I wasn't around to experience noise from the theater downstairs, so I can't comment on that. The homeless are very direct in downtown Seattle, but they're also quite \"professional\" so it's not that big a deal. My impression was that they were just exercising their right to ask me for money and in turn, they respected my right to say no. I really enjoyed my stay because it was no fuss, no frills, and no ugly surprises, so I could concentrate on other things.

My \"kitchenette\" could hardly be considered functional. There was a little stove, fridge, and sink. Entire contents of kitchen utensils: one pot, one pan, one spatula, place settings for 3 people. Yes, that's it. I needed to buy a knife for my fruit in the morning. I didn't come to Seattle to cook in my hotel, but the kitchenette may as well not have been there, for its usefulness. (It was even hard to make tea, believe it or not!! And I'm pretty good at improvising with less-than-perfect culinary situations.) 2. Controlling the heating in the room is not entirely up to you, you have to fiddle with the radiators (sometimes rather hot) and then balance what is coming out of them with the cool air coming into your open windows. 3. Bring your own clock, there's none in the room. 4. But there is a decent hair dryer. 5. The lower floor rooms might be noisy because of the theater. My impression, walking up the stairs of the hotel during a concert, was that the noise seemed a bit bad for the first two floors and much better by the fourth.

As you might imagine it is very expensive to stay downtown Seattle. In fact the West Coast has a much higher cost-of-living than Milwaukee. We checked out chain hotels, discount travel sites, and bed-and-breakfasts \u2014 but ultimately it was a travel guide (Frommer\u2019s 2005) that suggested The Moore Hotel. It\u2019s 2 blocks from the Public Market and sits on a main street (2nd ave) 1 mile from the train station. It\u2019s 3 blocks southeast to the West Lake bus tunnel and there are literally dozens of cafes / clubs / and shops in every direction. We walked from the Amtrak station to the Hotel with our luggage when we arrived; and we walked from the Hotel to the bus station when we left - ideally situated for use of public transportation. We opted for the $55/night room which has no bathroom (\u2019european style\u2019). This was half the rate we found even at most \u2018discount\u2019 chains. The bathroom was about 10\u2032 from our room and we had our own key - so even though it was not a \u2018private\u2019 bathroom, it was never inconvenient. The picture on the Moore website is not one of the european style rooms - ours was much smaller. The hotel was built around the turn of the [20th] century so there\u2019s a lot of historic details that make it an exciting place to stay - tall ceilings, lots of windows, exposed woodwork, wide hallways. And most (if not all) of the 7 story hotel has been refurbished with new carpeting, fresh paint and retiled floors. In fact, the room we were in had brand new lamps, bed and TV. There is also a phone in each room (dial \u20189\u2032 to get out) and basic cable. The only negative observations about our room were that the sink (all rooms have sinks) had no hot water pressure and Harmonie thought there should have been a full-length mirror and there was no clock. We were on the 7th floor - room 711 to be exact - and were afforded a great view of the Puget Sound and downtown Seattle. I\u2019ll upload some movies when I have some extra time so you can get a feel for the layout. I would highly, highly recommend staying here if you\u2019re ever in Seattle - and ask specifically for room 711 as some of rooms are in-facing (there\u2019s a kind of a \u2018courtyard\u2019 space running up the center of the hotel so that in-facing rooms can open to the fresh air\u2026 but it\u2019s not a pretty view) and some of the south-facing rooms are on an alley. There is also 1 public-use internet terminal and wireless access in the lobby. The workers were very helpful with suggestions and they provide a big rack of literature for tourist-y things-to-do. The clientele seems quite mixed, with a lot of younger / international travelers as well as some older. I didn\u2019t see any families. There is no pool or arcade, but there is an adjoining lounge/bar and theatre (which was, unfortunately, playing \u2018Annie\u2019 while we were there) which gets touring bands every now-and-then. Also there\u2019s no breakfast or coffee. There is also an elevator for those that don\u2019t like walking up seven flights of old-timey stairs.

Oh, and did I mention that you can catch the #194 bus for $1.25 just 1.5 blocks away and get to the airport faster than in a taxi? To update last year's comments: 1) The hotel is now completely non-smoking. 2) Free wireless in the lobby, and a computer with free internet access for those without laptops. 3) This year I had room 500 - larger and brighter than the room I had previously. The bathroom even had stained glass windows (not real, but hey). Enough hot water to keep me happy. Tv reception still sucked but I didn't watch it except to check the weather. I'm not in Seattle to watch tv. 2) The hotel staff is always polite, warm, friendly and so full of knowledge that they should write their own guidebook. They must get asked the same boring questions over and over again, and yet I witnessed them answer them again and again, very nicely, with as much info as they could think of. I don't know if I'd have the same patience. Examples: My flight out of Seattle didn't depart until 9 pm. They let me stay an hour later beyond the check out time, no charge, and held my luggage until I came back at 5:30 pm (in NYC, they charged $4 / per piece to hold it). Robert remembered me from last year, and as I was picking up my luggage, he went online, checked the bus schedule for me WITHOUT ME ASKING HIM TO and let me know, \"The bus is coming in 6 minutes!

There are three things about the Moore Hotel that make it a hotel I highly recommend - the character, the location and the value. The Moore is one of Seattle's more historic hotels with the charm of a bed and breakfast. Though an older building, it does not lack in comfort or amenities. Rooms are extremely generous in size. They easily accommodate two queen beds and the 12 foot ceilings allow large windows and wonderful views of the historic neighborhood. The finishes have been recently remodeled and the rooms are comfortable and clean. The hotel staff is personable, polite and accommodating. They make you feel like you are spending a weekend in their home, rather than in a hotel in a major city. A small lobby with marble floors and cozy sitting area for internet access lends to the bed and breakfast atmosphere. The hotel is located two blocks up from Pikes Place Market and two blocks north of the central shopping district. Its in an ideal location for easy walking to high end shopping or laid back cafes, boutiques and restaurants. There is plenty of parking in nearby garages or lots. The free downtown bus stops nearby and we felt very safe walking after dark from baseball games. And finally the value. The rates are unbeatable in a downtown location. You can spend two and three times as much in a nearby national chain hotel. That says it all. The Moore is a great choice for a comfortable, economical stay in the heart of downtown Seattle.

He was apologetic and claimed this was the first he'd heard of bed bugs in the Moore. We were booked to stay a third night, but were planning on going elsewhere. Mike said he'd help us out with the bill and find us another room so we decided to stay. The third night we came back at around 2ish. The night guy assigned us a new room on the 5th floor. We dragged everything to the new room, inspected the beds, unpacked, returned the other key and went back upstairs to finally go to sleep. As I pulled down the covers to go to bed I saw another bed bug crawling along the sheets. This time when we killed it it exploded with blood so it had obviously made a meal out of someone.

You enter a small lobby with a few chairs to comfortably sit in, and one person working at the desk. A 2nd person is usually in the office next to the desk. Check out when parking is free on the streets before you pay 10 dollars for about 10 hours of parking in the lots. I think we could have saved 10 dollars if we read the signs. They are extremely nice and helpful. I can not say enough about how much I enjoyed them. You then take an elevator to your floor.

Very old. The walls have been painted over in a very dark color, along with almost black colored carpeting in a wide hallway.

You leave the key at the front desk when you leave if others might need it to get in. We stayed in a 2 queen bed room. There were 4 of us. The bed was comfortable enough. The decor was 1944 bland. There was no place to put anything down in the bathroom, like a counter. The toilet was so close to the wall on its left that your butt hit the wall if you sat down. You had to sit more to the right. The flusher hit the wall, so they cut a hole in the wall to be able to flush the toilet. The shower was fine. Fat people could not use the facility here. Not in my room. There is no screen in the window and no air conditioning. We left the window open all night (birds could have flown in as there were many), and traffic noise went on. I had no problem sleeping, but others could not stand the sound of traffic. I was exhausted and crashed with no problem. Staying near Pikes Market means you are in the run down part of town. I would prefer to stay in a nicer section. I did not realize how scary it could be.You are literally a 5 minute walk from the Market, and a block or 2 further to the waterfront. It is all downhill, so remember you need to walk back up again. During the day it was ok. We walked past a lot of scary people. I would not go out at night. I did get up earlier than the rest of the group, and since I had no place to watch tv without disturbing them, I went downstairs. They told me there was a McDonalds that opens at 630am. I walked there. about 3 blocks.I met all the drunks in recovery while I bought my coffee. Starbucks opens at 7. I brought the coffee back to the hotel and sat in the lobby, comfortably reading until about 930 when others got up. Seattle seems to be the most expensive city in the country. I don't think you will be murdered if you stay here, but I think I would prefer to stay at the airport the next time I overnight for a cruise. Or in a nicer neighborhood. If you walk in the opposite direction from your hotel you come to a really nice (expensive) section with Nordstroms, and all sorts of expensive fancy stores. A nice area.

The neighborhood is a little gritty, but we never felt unsafe at any time. It is a highly trafficked area, so you're seldom wandering about by yourself. Once inside the room, it's a pretty bare bones setup, but everything was super clean, functional, we had a fantastic view of the water, and the building is constructed like a prison (thick plaster walls), so we never heard a peep from our neighbors. The close proximity to just about everything is amazing - we walked to Pioneer Square (~25 minutes), Safeco Park (~35 minutes), Pike Place Market (less than 5 minutes), and took a quick bus ride over to the Seattle Center. This place is central to everything you'll need to explore Seattle efficiently and thoroughly. If you're into fancypants-type accomodations and need a lot of catering to, this place is not for you. There are no clocks in the room, no pictures on the wall, you may/may not get a mirror in your room, but the place is well worth the money that you'll save, and the service that we received from everyone working there was 5-star. They definitely have a lifelong customer in my guy and myself. The Moore Hotel is located smack on the border of Belltown, which is loaded with great eats, great bars, and tons of twenty/thirty-something hispters. For food, check out Le Pichet, Dahlia Lounge, Mama's Mexican Kitchen, OHanas, and Caffe D'Arte for awesome coffee/teas (skip Starbucks/Tully's). For entertainment, the Virigina Inn is a nice place to grab a beer, while places like Lava Lounge, Shorty's Coney Island, and The Whiskey Bar are more chaotic, but still good fun. The Palace Kitchen is a great late-night option, and they serve free pistachios at the bar.", "Date": "August 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cQuirky and Friendly Place to Stay\u201d", "Author": "Musictraveller", "ReviewID": "UR5560470", "Content": "I was worried when I got there...it was an hour or two before check in, but the desk staff made it seem like they didn't have my registration.

I was a single traveler and took a room with bath for only $65/night. The same room for two people in it would have been ~$80/night.

It's between Pike Place and Belltown. The walk to each is about 3-5 minutes, if even that. TRANSPORTATION: From the airport buses (174 and 194), it's a 5-minute walk with luggage.

My spirit has been lifted. Our visit with Jayna was the best. It was raining when we landed at Sea-Tac, but by the time we loaded our luggage into the trunk of our rental car the sun was peaking through the clouds. The weather was cool, but when the wind blew it made the hair on your neck stand up. The Moore Hotel was nice. Our Room was on the 6th floor with a panoramic view of the Puget Sound. The room was clean and comfortable. If I could make a suggestion to the proprietor, it would be to put a small shelf in the bath room and a place to hang your robe behind the bathroom door would be nice. This hotel is in the heart of Downtown Seattle, a block east of Pike's Market Place and a block west of Nordstrom's. We spent a small fortune in parking, but all in all it was worth it. The Mariners swept the series with the San Francisco Giants. Barry Bonds hit a home run his first at bat. So did Ichiro. Day 2 Mike went to the ballgame with his brothers Randy and Steve for game two of a three game series. It was Gay Pride week in Seattle. Jayna and I exhibited our diversity and joined the festivities at the Fremont Street Fair. This is it's 35th year of celebrating the Summer Solstice. It was a large diverse group of warm bodies. Belly dancers, floats and naked men and women (sporting only body paint) danced through the streets raising awareness to the needs of low-income and the homeless community (the 6 foot tall stuffed penis got my attention). The fair is free but donations are accepted. Donations received directly fund Fremont Public Association (FPA). The fair was loaded with exhibits, art, crafts, musical entertainment and food. Jayna and I escaped the hot pavement and retreated to a Thai restaurant. I had the Cashew Chicken with vegetables and rice, YUM! Jayna had the Chicken Curry with noodles. Afterwards, we met Mike and his brothers at Ivars to say our goodbyes. Then Mike, Jayna and I took the ferry over to Bainbridge and headed towards Port Townsend. Day 3 Jayna's friend Shannon was a life saver! Our reservation at the Water Street Hotel (WSH) was nearly lost. But Shannon was able to retrieve our room key before 6pm. Thank you Shannon! The WSH is very old. It was built in 1889 by EH Fisher. The Hotel offers a beautiful view of the Puget Sound, Mount Baker, the Cascade, and Olympic Mountains. It is in the heart of Downtown PT Historic District and within walking distance to shops, and restaurants. The festive spirit of Gay Pride week followed us up to Port Townsend. The WSH is above the Water Street Brewing and Ale House. The Ale House offered a masquerade/costume party on Saturday evening. The music was so loud you could hear hear it three floors up. The patrons partied until the early morning hours. The featured entertainer was DJ Ramiro. For breakfast we went to the Landing Restaurant. Jayna suggested the Baked Blueberry French Toast stuffed with Cream Cheese. Oh my Gawd! I highly recommend this one. Afterwards we walked out onto a pier and watched as boats docked. Then walked through all the shops downtown. The shops are all quaint and tastefully done. My favorite, was \"Maestrale\". An eclectic collection of old and new. I found the cutest cobalt blue antique drawer pulls. ~Cute-Cute-Cute!~ That evening we ate dinner at the Fountain Caf\u00e9. We had dinner salads with Honey/yogurt dressing and Taylor Gold Pears. Our meal was the most flavorful blend of Italian cheeses, noodles and chicken. Most people call this Chicken Fettuccini. I say it was the best I've ever tasted. For dessert we shared a Cr\u00e8me Brule. Oh My Gawd! This is the best restaurant in the world. We had the best waitress, the atmosphere was delightful and the Art exhibit was colorful. Day 4 We checked out of the WSH, then went to visit Jayna's friend Joe. He is a Barista in uptown PT near Aldrich's Market. Joe makes a mean latte. Day trip with Jayna to Fort Warden and the beach. We hiked to a remote cliff face with a 500 foot drop. Scary! Then we took a long long walk along the beach. We laughed, talked and reminisced. It was a good day. We took Jayna back to her house and made the drive back to Seattle and then home. I miss her.

I booked a hotel in Seattle for the rest of the stay and just needed a hotel for the first night--which was difficult to find since all the hotels seemed to be booked on that night. So I found the Moore as a fluke through tripadvisor.com-- I did a search for hotels that were under $100 dollars a night in the downtown region and the Moore came up and ranked #15 of all seattle hotels. I read through the reviews and was a little nervous at first since some compared it to a hostel or sleazy motel. But I noticed those reviews were quite early and the most recent reviews were pretty favorable so I decided to book. Plus the night my friend and I arrived in Seattle we had to catch a show at the Crocodile Cafe--which was only 3 blocks away from the moore. When we got to the hotel, we observed how a couple in front of us were treated since there was a mix up with their reservation. apparently they reserved two queen beds with private bath, but since there was a glitch in the reservation system (that neglected to acknowlege that the two queen rooms were sold out) the person at the front desk offered the couple a room with 2 beds and a single that was connected together at a discounted price. When it became our turn to check in, he did the same for us except we got a room with 1 queen bed and 1 and twin bed. The person at the front desk was really nice and cordial. Now on to the actual hotel... The room was decently clean but no frills--lacked little amenities such as remote control. But I think the lobby had a free internet terminal and I saw a few people downstairs using wireless. Since the moore is located in the heart of Seattle's trendy Belltown neighborhood as soon as you step out of the moore, there's tons of bars and restaurants at your feet at night, and litlte trendy shops and salons to visit in the day.

Like the other reviewer, I walked to The Moore from the King Street Amtrak Station. Although walking isn't too bad, it is pretty far. I made the mistake of walking along 1st and then walking up Virginia which is an extremely steep hill. By the way, the hotel website is misleading. The picture that's shown is the Moore Theater which is not entrance for the hotel. The hotel is located on 2nd Ave in the middle of Stewart and Virginia. The sign for the entrance to the hotel is flat against the building so it's not visible while walking along the street. I reached the area at 11 at night and was totally confused on where the hotel was. Maybe I was just tired.

Save yourself the punishment on your knees by walking on 2nd Ave over to Pike Street to get to the market. If you want some good exercise, you can then walk uphill on Stewart to get back to the hotel. Also, I found that the majority of the market doesn't start opening up until 10am and then it takes them about 1/2 hour to setup. By 6pm, everything is pretty much closed.

Pike Street Market was just two blocks away, so you can get up early in the morning and head down to get a cup of coffee and watch everyone set up before the crowds arrive. Tully's and Starbucks one block away. I patronized the Starbucks in the morning for our coffee and cocoa and a few pastries.

As a single female traveler, I could walk around and feel relatively safe and the front desk kept a good eye on their lobby and the comings and goings of their patrons. Now, the neighborhood immediately outside the door looks even safer and more options are available for shoppers, diners, beer and cocktail seekers than ever before.

Walk to Pike Place in the morning, shopping at Pioneer Square in the afternoon, visit nearby Belltown at night. Walk everywhere. They'll hold your luggage for you either before your check-in time or after you've checked out but have a few hours to kill before catching your flight. Visiting the convention center - it's less than 10 minutes walk, grab coffee at the French Bakery at Pike's Place before you head into convention hell. Worst part - Parking - you have to pay, there are two lots on either side of the hotel or try the Bon/Macy's parking lot for something a bit cheaper. Oh, and they like to keep your key at the front desk - there is only ONE KEY available per room, so if you're sharing with someone but have different itineraries, make a habit of dropping the key off at the front desk. I would trust these people, I once left a drawerfull of clothes behind and they were kind enough to take care of them until I returned the next day, ashamed but extremely grateful.

I paid $286, including taxes, for four nights in a single room, and my friends paid $311 for a double. You can't beat that price for such a central location. The beds were very comfortable. Every day, the maid would pick up stuff of mine that was lying around and leave it neatly on the windowsill. My only complaint was with the bathrooms. I could not get my shower to deliver both hot water and good pressure, and the shower stall was extremely small. The toilet sometimes had to be flushed twice. Also, there was no plug for the bathroom sink, so I had to put a washcloth over the drain before putting my contacts in. My friends had one of the claw-foot tubs with shower curtain, and said they had no problems with the water. However, their toilet malfunctioned on our last day, and no one turned up to fix it. They were able to use the hall toilet, and the front desk offered to move them to another room, but they didn't want to bother and so just used the hall toilet.

After reading several great reviews about the Moore on tripadvisor, I decided that this might be the best place to stay in Seattle for a great price. I ended up spending $69 a night, which is a steal for downtown Seattle. However from the moment I pulled up I soon realized why it was so cheap. First of all, it is in the ghetto part of DT Seattle. There are only about 2 blocks which I would consider \"bad\", and The Moore is situated right there in the middle of the bad part of town. Second of all, we were taken back by the strong smell of pine sol when we entered our room. After leaving for the evening and returning to our room, we discovered why the pine sol scent was so strong----it was masking the smell of urine in our room!!! I believe that the cleaning people tried to get rid of the urine smell by bombarding our room with cleaning supplies. I tried to air out the room,but the noise from the street down below made it unbearable to get a good night's sleep. Last but not least, no one said anything to me when I booked the room that there would not be any parking. I understand that most hotels downtown have paid parking, but the Moore had nothing. I had two options: 1) Leave my car on the street in the middle of the ghetto(which even the front desk was a bad idea) or 2) pay a parking garage $40 a day. My suggestion to anyone considering the Moore: If you want the low price, stay outside of DT since you will have to pay for parking anyways, or break the bank and stay at a nicer place!

But I had never stayed in downtown Seattle before in the 25+ years I resided in Western Washington. So, on our most recent trip to see family, my husband and I decided to stay downtown for a night and take in the usual tourist sights. (Space Needle, Pike Place, Westlake and the Monorail, etc.) I had seen the coupon for 10% off the price of the Moore in the Visitor's packet I got earlier in the year and had wondered if it was a good place or not. Then I saw the reviews on here and though they were mostly great reviews, I still wondered....but decided to take a chance. Well, I am happy to say it was great! We had no trouble finding it off of I-5. It's uphill from the Pike Place Market, but most things are, so if you're walking wear some comfortable shoes. We walked everywhere and it was great. You really get to take in the feel of the city that way. Our room was on the 7th floor, excellent view of the water and the ferries! The staff was great, very helpful and courteous. The shower water pressure was good and the room smelled clean, not musty or dirty. It was nice that we could open the windows. I noticed a few people here said the noise was bad and the walls were thin but I did not notice a thing. I enjoyed hearing the noise of the city, we kept our windows open all night. But I think if you wanted your windows closed it would have been plenty quiet. We felt completely safe there. Our only complaint would be about the parking, not so much the price because we knew that we would have to pay, but the convenience. The open lot accross the street was not clearly labeled as to if you could park overnight? We opted to park in the locked garage next door to it, overnight. $15. Note that if you are leaving early in the morning as we were, they don't open their doors to let you get your car until 8 a.m. But this doesn't have much to do with the hotel - so I'm not holding it against them or this review.
