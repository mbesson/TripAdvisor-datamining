No sign of any mice but then we took notice of the signs and didn't take food into out room. Great location for access to Dam square/ red light district and other central locations. Always felt safe.

It has a really good location close to the Dam, and also it's quite cheap. The staff is also very friendly and good English-speaker, but these are all positive things about this Hostel. The rooms are overcrowded and not very clean, you have sleep with 5-7 people in a really small mixed room. Security is also very poor, there is no safety locker, you have to keep your belongings in your room, where people go in and out every time. Therefore it was not surprising, when during our sleep somebody has robbed us. If you have chosen this Hostel, You would mind your belongings, and stay in the Hostel as little as you can.

Now, the rest: When we made our reservation we discovered it was a weekend when all hotels in Amsterdam were already fully booked due to a technical conference of some sort in the city, and so we had to pay double their normal rate, which was fine because we agreed to it and knew exactly what we were doing. What wasn't fine, is that we booked a non-smoking double room, and once we paid our 10 euro key deposit and got up to our room, we discovered we got a twin room with an ashtray on the table and unbelievable cigarette stench in the air. We went down to reception, and were told that we can't be given a different room because everybody had already checked-in, but we can move the beds together if we want, and - wait for it - we can either smoke or not smoke in the room. That, by the way, was only after the receptionist tried to convince us that the smell probably came from one of the neighbouring rooms, which it most certainly didn't. When we voiced our disbelief at the answers we were given, she said we can also cancel the room and be refunded the money we paid, even though it was a non-refundable reservation (hence, the good part). I think it's probably a good opportunity to remind you now that we paid 235 euros for this room, and that this was a fully booked weekend in Amsterdam, when there was no way in hell we were going to get a room in another hotel, whereas the marvelously unwelcoming hotel Mevlana will surely find another couple to stick in that room in a matter of minutes. Anyhow, we decided not to stay there - thank god for relatives in Rotterdam - so we got back upstairs, dragged our luggage back downstairs to reception, and were told we won't be getting our 10 euros key deposit, because now they have to order the cleaning people again. This is, of course, quite a cheeky claim to make, as the reason they now have to call in the cleaning people again stems from their very own utter lack of respect towards paying customers, to say the least. They wouldn't budge on that, because as they see it - I obviously have to pay something for their mistake. So I guess it all comes down to our freaking 10 euros buying us - apart from the need to lug ourselves and our luggage all the way to Rotterdam - also the right to make this rant.
