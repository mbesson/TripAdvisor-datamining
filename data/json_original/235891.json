The location is great - immediately behind the Gritti Palace hotel and close to the water taxi stop (2 minutes walk from the Grand Canal) and approximately 5 minutes walk from the Airport water taxi stop at St. Marks square. Really close walking distance to everything that matters. The Palazzo is a mixture of timeshare and regular hotel with different room options. Our room was very spacious for Italy and espeically Venice, with a wonderfully large bedroom with quality linens, several enormous wardrobes, a large sitting room with 3 long sofas (1 of which converted into a sofa bed), a dining table and chairs and a very small kitchenette with a fridge, sink and 2 hotplates. There was no oven, microwave or diswasher and if you are on an exchange then you need to clean the kitchen yourself and leave it in the clean and tidy condition you found it in - I assume if you are a hotel guest then the cleaning is included - however no cleaning materials are provided so you would need to provide your own - was not an issue for us. There were plenty of plates, glasses and basic cooking items. There are a few grocery shops - see other reviews for where they are. We intended to self cater to keep costs down, but found that the tourist menus are good value (away from St. Marks) so ended up eating out. However be warned, everything in Venice is expensive - apart from the local wine which is excellent and you can buy 2 litres for 10 euros. The bathroom was reasonably spacious, sink, toilet, bidet and large jetted bathtub with shower over - all in marble with murano glass mirrors and accessories. Plentiful towels of very good quality - lots of hot water The unit is meant to sleep 5, for 2 it was very generous, for 4 or 5 it would be very snug - however the bathroom is separate from the main bedroom so there is an amount of privacy - but if 4/5 adults you would have to be very good friends as it could get a little crowded! Ideal for a couple of adults and 2 children. The hotel and the room were all immaculate and a credit to the housekeeping staff, and it is very evident that the staff take a lot of pride in their establishment. The reception staff were very helpful and friendly at all times - nothing too much trouble. We took advantage of a breakfast offer in the hotel and had breakfast in each day - if you are a timeshare guest then breakfast is chargable. It is a continential breakfast, and help yourself, but as much as you wanted with cereal, eggs, juice, milk, cheese, ham, yogurts, fresh fruit and an assortment of pastires, tea and coffee on demand - we found that this was quite substantial and kept us going for the day. It's quite basic but all well presented and fresh. The style of the hotel was traditional Venitian which is quite restrained - however there was lots of Murano glass and valuable wooden furniture and timeshare exchangers should be aware of the 700 euro deposit required at check in to cover any potential breakages of said items - in the room there were a couple of very valuable floor lamps, side lamps and mirrors and we were very concious of needing to take extra care! The deposit was taken with a credit card and returned at the end of the stay with no problem. This is the higest deposit we have ever paid during a timeshare exchange - but then it is Venice and the Murano glass is very expensive, espeically antique pieces like the ones they have in the hotel. It was very nice to have the antique pieces in the room - very different. Overall were were very pleased with out stay. Previously we have stayed at the Danieli and the room was as good as one of their standard rooms, the location better for us but without the wider benefits of the larger hotel and the stunning public rooms which the Danieli has. The hotel does have wi-fi and a guest PC - both of which are chargable for timeshare exchangers. Note that the hotel does not have any water views as it is on an internal square. The only minor critisim, is that unlike other reviewers, we did experience some noise whilst staying - the Gritti Palace next door is closed until 2013 and undergoing extensive rennovation and we did expereince some noise in the morning from the workmen - however the hotel is trying very hard to limit this where possible, but ask for more details if this is important to you. Had it not been for this factor I would have given my review 5 stars rather than 4. Did not really bother us as we are early risers and then were out and about all day and it is generally very quiet at night so a good night's sleep is avaiable. Venice is a quiet place generally - most folk go to bed early and most restaurants close around 10.30 - not the place if you are looking for late night parties.. Overall a great stay and would recommend this hotel for more of a traditional expereince. please email me if you want further details.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mayfield, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cDREAM COME TRUE\u201d", "Author": "plumbarius", "ReviewID": "UR123001425", "Content": "The hotel was absolutely charming, the old world charm really made you feel you were in and part of Venice.

It was such a great find in Venice!! Reason's we loved it: 1) It's so easy to get to. One stop off the Grand Canal Vaporetto and you're there. No complicated walks down Venice alleys. Also, minutes from St Marks Square so very accessible to everything. 2) Large room for Italy. Decent bed, clean, great closet space, and really nice big bathroom. We also got a nice patio deck that we sat on at night drinking wine. 3) Great customer service, and little perks. The staff were so friendly (way above what we experienced in other places), and helped us with everything. They also included Palazzo del Giglio slippers in the room, free wi-fi in the room, and brought up a complimentary bottle of champagne on the last night we were there. Additionally, when we checked out, they gave us a Bach CD, which we listened to as we drove all throughout Tuscany. Breakfast was the only draw back as it was really basic, but my husband still enjoyed it. They served fresh croissants with nutella and various spreads, as well as coffee and cappuccino. Overall, you really can't beat this hotel in Venice. It was also amazingly priced for the room and the location.

Let the hotel book the water taxi and the driver phones the desk and a porter is awaiting you at the Vaporetto stop that serves the area of S.M. Gigilio. Only Vaporetto No 1 stops there but it's the best route taking you to the Lido or the other way under the Rialto to the railway station.
