The hotel was pretty cheap and seemed in a fairly good location (on 10th Avenue, only 2 roads back from the beach) so I guess we shouldn't have been surprised that the room facilities were pretty basic. No TV, no iron, no kettle, no breakfast, awful tacky bathroom with missing lights, a rickety noisy old air-con (which at least worked, thank god), an air of mustiness and a tiny \"pool\" that was more a breeding ground for the mosquitoes infesting our room. On the positive side, the staff seemed fairly friendly, and at least it gave us an excuse to avoid going back to the room, and spending more time relaxing on the beach!

I will try to keep it as short as possible... let's just say, we learned some spanish while staying at Playa del Karma. Beechus (bugs), in our kama (bed), and Manchas (stains) on our Sabanas (sheets)! We stayed here towards the end of Dec. Peak season in PDC so most hotels were fully booked. As it was our first time in Mexico, we shrugged off the initial bites on day one, assuming they were from the pesky mosquitoes. But by midnight on Day 2, we realized we were literally being bitten alive by tiny bugs in our bed. Realizing we hadn't been bitten once during the day, but only at night, we inspected the sheets and discovered tiny bugs at the bottom of the mattress (which had a rip in it). After alerting the front desk the next morning, we were promised a new mattress and that things would get better. We decided to hope for the best and tried to enjoy the rest of our stay. Day 3 - with much trepidation, we head to bed. For a honeymooning couple, it's sad that the bed was the last place we wanted to be!! By 4am we were itching and scratching our poor ankles again, and this time we decided to take pictures of everything. From the ant nests on the walls, in the bathrooms and the bedroom, to the little white ants crawling all over the sink and the bedside tables!! We inspected the mattress, and as we had suspected, they hadn't changed it as promised, but simply flipped it so we would think it was a new one. The rip was still there. By day 4 - we were getting desperate. The Manager was never seen or heard from. We were promised another room, if/when it would become available. FINALLY we got one. A much nicer one, with no beechus. But this time, I had to inspect the sheets as we had become experts after reading bed bug forums on my hubby's iPhone at 5am!! *Yikes* tiny blood stains - indication of tiny bugs that have died there. Pulled the covers back further - and there was a MASSIVE yellow stain. I could keep going on and on, but finally we got the sheets changed and had our FIRST full night's rest. Luckily, the days were super and PDC did not disappoint in any other way. We were also able to find another hotel closeby (Mosquito Beach - ironic?) that we fell in love with and were able to book a last minute room on Expedia for the remainder of our stay. Looking back, all would have been well if we hadn't gotten Room 14! The hotel itself is in an awesome location. Close to Avenue 5 + local haunts and activities. It's been done really nicely, with lots of palm trees and greenery. There's a little pool, full of bugs floating in it, which adds more ambiance than encouragement to swim! Luckily they have free passes to use Mamitas, which we thought was fantastic (despite having to fight for beach chairs and umbrellas if you get down there past 10am) until we tried the Mosquito Beach club! Little did we know such luxury could exist just a block down the beach!!! *sigh* My mistake for booking a more rustic hotel, rather than a luxury one for our honeymoon. Everything would have been fine, had the Management actually been around to handle things. Poor Mario did his best. But it just wasn't good enough. The lady Manager was extremely rude and refused to believe us, until we showed her our documented proof in photos and videos we had taken over the past 4 days of hell. Despite all this, she took no responsibility and never apologized for ruining our vacation. Just barked at us asking - \"well what do you want?\" - like a discount could make things better. I was sad to have to leave on a sour note. We refused to pay for the nights we were in Rm 14 and luckily we had not prepaid on our first day because their credit card machine had been down. There;s no way she would have ever refunded us our money!! Believe me, this is shorter than everything else I would like to add, but I hope no one goes through what we did. It seems like all the other rooms were fine. Just make sure you don't prepay until you've seen the room & checked the sheets.

Let me begin with the positives: * The staff at Playa Del Karma are wonderful. I would like to give special thanks to Erick and Mario. They both went out of their way to be helpful and always kind. Thank you both very much. Honestly, I cannot praise the staff enough. * Second positive is the tropical courtyard - very nice. * Third positive was use of Mamitas Beach Club - very enjoyable each day we went. As far as the negatives, we were very disappointed in the rooms. I paid the higher price for a Karma Room expecting a nice, clean, and comfortable space. This was not the case. We were first placed in room 14. It was dark with very poor lighting. The room had a very musty smell and our greatest concern was that there was mold visible through the paint at the bottom of the bathroom floor as well as the bottom of one of the wall floors. After 2 nights in this room, we could no longer tolerate the musty smell and requested to be moved. Mario was very gracious in getting us moved to room 23. This room was certainly better than room 14; however, it simply was not what we had expected from the pictures on the website. Playa Del Karma certainly has a charm about it; however, I would recommend they look into the room concerns I have expressed.

It was our first trip to Playa Del Carmen, and I must say that this hotel proved to be an exceptional value. Being students, we were on a fairly tight budget and the price we payed through a package deal with flight on Expedia was very reasonable. We also opted for transportation to and from the airport through expedia ($40 per person roundtrip) and that worked out very well. The hotel itself has a unique charm to it with an open common area in the middle of the hotel that was perfect for relaxing with a book &/or cervesa, the rooms were very clean (daily), nice/large shower. The room had a fan which we used daily and an air conditioner which we never had to turn on. WiFi was strong as we were in a room towards the back and had no problem watching streamed movies. The staff was exceptional! Both of the hotel's primary attendants went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable and you could tell that they really cared about their guests and their hotel's reputation. Examples: We were going to do the Chichen Itza trip at $99 per person through the sightseeing companies (could be $22 using public transport - but no guide - which we wanted) - the hotel informed us of a deal they worked out to offer this same guided trip - with a buffet and extra stops at a cool Cenote (Underground river...bring your swim suit) and Valadolid (neat Mexican city) included in a $50 per person ticket....GREAT DEAL! Also, we decided last minute that we wanted to do a snorkeling trip - Stephania contacted the company to lock in our places and even walked us to the pick up location a few blocks away (we had to walk since we were late additions) to make sure we got on ok. Location is excellent - just a couple blocks and you are in the middle of the tourist area and four blocks to the beach. I prefer not to be right in the middle of the loud tourist area where bars/clubs are open really late. Convenience store (OXOX) on the next block towards the ocean where you can buy snacks & beach goodies (including a cooler).

The hotel is small - all it has is about 17 rooms, a small pool, a small breakfast area, and the lobby. The rooms are dark and very basic (it\u2019s just the bed/s, bathroom and a TV - some don't even have a TV). Don't expect any sort of view- the hotel is located far from the beach. It can get really hot (especially at the lobby), so make sure to keep your air conditioning on all day. The pool is extremely small and has lots of leaves, which makes it look a little dirty. Also, there's isn\u2019t really a nice area where you can sit by the pool and relax. The breakfast they offer is bread, orange juice, coffee, and cereal. There isn\u2019t anything else. Accordingly, it is very cheap and could be good if you are not very hungry. Otherwise, you can find nicer places where to have breakfast just a few blocks from the hotel. The real standout of Playa del Karma is the staff. They really were outstanding: Very polite and always willing to help. They truly will make you feel at home and very welcome. The hotel is also just 2 blocks from the area in Playa del Carmen where all the bars and restaurants and shops are located. so if you don\u2019t mind not being directly on the beach, the location is excellent. A few additional comments: - The wireless did not work during my entire stay. However, there's a computer at the lobby that you can use free of charge. - No hairdryers, ladies- so bring your own! - Stay away from the rooms with the hay roofs! My friends stayed in one and lizards would fall on their bed in the middle of the night! Also, they could hear animals moving on the roof -very uncomfortable. My room had a regular roof and I did not have any issues with animals or bugs, so please request to be moved to a room with a regular roof if you get one of the other ones! - There is a lid on the shower that keeps bugs from creeping inside the room. However, when you shower, please be sure to pull the lid out so the water can go inside! I heard of a couple's room that flooded because they forgot to do this! - I would never pay more than 80/night to stay at this hotel. If what you are looking for is just a bed to sleep on\u2026. if you are not planning on spending much time at the hotel\u2026 and if want to be close to Playa del Carmen town but don't want to spend a lot of money, then this is the place for you.

Perfectly adequate rates a 3 from me. The website makes out that this is a yoga/ holistic type place which, frankly, does not mean much to me, but to those who care, it is really not accurate. There was a yoga teacher one day we were there (I don't do yoga) and massages can be arranged as it true everywhere in Playa, a town not lacking in massage places. Rooms were cute and very clean, but the beds were terrible and sheets were coarse. I know Mexican beds, having spent a great deal of time throughout Mexico. These weren't the hard beds found in Mexican hotels of all categories. These were cheap, springy beds with Walmart sheets. Maybe 150 count. The beds affected my sleep, which is rare as I have slept in $5.00 hotels, in hammocks, on the ground and on roofs, and in Four Seasons. Staff is very nice, rooms are clean, location fine. Shower leaked. I would stay again, but it is just okay. Management could elevate the hotel just by getting better beds and sheets, and not having instant coffee with Coffeemate.

Our ground floor room was simple, and had a palapa roof [we wanted to be reminded of the old Mexico]. Not fancy. but comfortable. Very comfortable bed, lots of towels, constant hot water, small outside patio with chairs and hammock.

When we first embarked on this holiday we were hesitating, as my wife, and I have normally stay 4* without exception on all of our family holidays. It was only when struggling to decide on our hotel in Playa del Carmen that we stumbled upon Hotel Playa del Karma, and began reading the reviews. I searched over and over for the bad review and I found very, very few, all diligently answered by the manager who seems very much on top of things. I somehow knew that all these people leaving positive reviews couldn't be wrong so we decided to go for it and give it a try. Our first experience of \u201cLeon\u201d shear profesionalism and dedication to his guests came when we entered the property and were warmly welcomed by him. When you arrive at Playa del Karma, the very first thing you notice is the greenery of the beautiful tropical garden and the scenic pool (small one) that is ideal to refresh. The hotel itself is more like a ethnic boutique hotel (as they call it) than anything else, rustic and peculiar at the same time. Breakfast is served in their twin hotel Hacienda Paradise, very close and very charming too. We could even use their pool service if we wanted to and were treated as if we were guests of that hotel. After all they belong to the same company. There is no better way than a colorful buffet that included the unexpected to start our day full of activities. Cristian and Aurea at Karmatrails, the concierge service, are simply one of the kindest, warmest and most helpful people we have ever had the pleasure of meeting and they made our stay even recommending beautiful places and excursions . Thanks also go to Bepe who prepared beautiful cappuccinos and expreso just the way only Italians can do. Rooms are nice and colorful, maybe just a little dark but fully surrounded by this vegetation and curios birds singing in the morning. A real bravo to all of them.

I would definitely recommend for those looking for traditional, small and not a very big budget. Our room was about $70 plus taxes and well worth it.

The people were very friendly and helpful. The room was a nativo quadruple which while somewhat small, had a king size bed downstairs and a loft with a palapa roof which contained two single beds. The air conditioning worked great, although it was a little warmer up in the loft which has an open window with screen that competes with the AC. A few minor problems we encountered were figuring out three days before our trip that they are trying to cater to adults and not families. This is not stated on their website as far as I can tell, and they even had a location for number of children on the reservation form I filled out, but I later found another site that noted they were a gay friendly and adult couples hotel. So, after a last minute panic, they were nice enough to let us stay there with our children anyway. The room was pretty clean, but when I tried to put some of my sons stuff in a night stand drawer, there was a little bit of garbage including a condom wrapper. Could have done without that, but I guess that could happen at any hotel, just missed by the maid. Upon our return in the same room, it was gone. Also, there is a sewer gas problem. They have a cover in the shower drain that you need to keep in place. It was not there on our first arrival, so I'm guessing it is a rainy season thing, that happened in the intervening week. Probably a city wide problem this time of year would be my guess, and really was not a big issue, but I would have liked to have been told about it when we checked in. I consider the complaints to be generally minor, and would stay here again for the price, it was over all a good experience, and I would recommend it to someone looking for a nice budget motel.

The room had air conditioning, which was a welcome relief after hot days on the beach. It was also very clean and we didn't see any bugs. The one downside was the padding in the mattress--or lack thereof. It felt like sleeping on two bare box springs. I also wished there had been an actual closet instead of just a nook with room for a few hangers, but it wasn't a huge problem. Our room came stocked with a great selection of local fresh fruit (for free!). The hotel serves a basic complimentary breakfast (additional items are available for a fee). As for the service--it was excellent! Everyone on staff was extremely friendly and willing to help at any moment. The hotel arranged for our transfer to and from the airport, and had good suggestions on places to eat in the area. They also offer excursion packages to Mayan ruins and other attractions, but we were able to find somewhat cheaper deals through other companies. Our room came with complimentary passes to the Mamitas Beach Club, which I would definitely recommend. The club is a good walk from the hotel but it's worth the hike, because it sits on arguably the best strip of beach in Playa. The hotel also provided us with towels.

It is a few blocks away from Avenida 5 (the main drag with shops, restaurants and bars), so at first I was worried about being too far from the action. My worries were quelled, however, when after a loud night out on the town, we were able to retire quietly to Hotel Playa del Karma and relax peacefully. We booked a Karma room (#21) which features include a secure safe, coffee maker, a complimentary fruit bowl, the requisite mini-bar, AC and TV. The rooms look a tad bigger on the website, so we were glad to make good use of the huge porch in front of our room, which was furnished with a hammock, two chairs and a table as well as an adequate light for reading. The concierge was really helpful when it came to giving advice on what to do, what to see and transportation information. There was a modest continental breakfast each morning in the hotel's upstairs restaurant, where there was coffee (mexican and regular), hot water for tea, bread for toast, an assortment of cereals, sweet breads (like pound cake and a chocolately thing), butter, jam and juice. There also appeared to be a number of liquados, fresh juices and smoothies available for a cost. The hotel also features a leafy, lush courtyard with a small pool. The pool was big enough for a soak and a chat with friends, but is nothing you'd swim laps in. There was also a waterfall in the pool that ran occasionally. The sauna on the side of the pool looked interesting, but once we learned that it was actually a spa service and cost $75 usd to book it, it didn't seem quite so appealing. When we made our reservation for the Karma room, the hotel included free wi-fi and free passes for Mamita's beach club, both of which we found to be great perks. The hotel is a good jumping off point to several destinations. It is close to an ADO bus station and just a few minutes walk to the collectivos vans on Avenida 2 as well as the ferry station where you can catch the boat to Cozumel.

The hotel is on 15th, so 2 blocs from 5th street (pedestrian shopping street) and 3 blocks from the beach. our room had a mini fridge, fan, air conditioner but no TV (which was great for us) Depending on the room you are staying you might get a free ticket to mamitas beach club, ours didn't give one for free but the hotel sold tickets for 2 loungers and shade for a better price than at the beach itself. Since we went to mamitas only once (it's worth going) there was no reason to pay more for a room just to get the free tickets. Actually, the entrance to Mamitas is free.

This hotel is extremely clean. My husband and I had a king-sized bed and a bungalow that had two levels - the upstairs had an additional two beds! The style here is very unusual and cool. We liked to just hang out by the plunge pool and drink coffee/tea when we were tired of the beach. They also offer free breakfast in the morning and free internet which is nice. This hotel is very centrally located and an easy walk to beach, nightlife, etc. and most of the rooms have outdoor hammocks that you can use (ours did not because we had the larger \"house\"). The only weird thing I will say is our \"house\" was directly next to the kitchen and dining area, so in the morning it was basically like we were sleeping IN the kitchen. This wouldn't have been so bad except we chose to sleep with the windows open (all the rooms do have A/C but we didn't use ours) and so the smells/noises of breakfast were quite strong. Again, I don't want to say that the hotel is noisy (it is quite the opposite) but out of all the rooms in the hotel, ours is the only one that would have this problem because of where it was located, and I wouldn't have even noticed if we had been using our A/C. So you may want to request that you not have the room located next to the breakfast dining area/kitchen. It didn't bother me that much, but it was kind of weird. The other thing is, we had a little bit of a hard time finding this hotel (I don't know why, because it is very central as I said) and NONE of the locals had heard of it. Anyone on the street that we asked mistakenly thought we just kept saying \"Playa del Carmen\" wrong. So that was a bit frustrating. If you are going to be walking here (as we did) from the ferry port, make sure you have a good map or know where you are going because it seems like the locals aren't that familar with the name of this place.

The tile, bamboo and thatched roof was very cool and authentic - what I imagined a room in Mexico would be like. The entire staff was fantastic. Everyone was friendly and very helpful. When we decided to travel to Tulum for the day, we weighed several options and one of the managers of the hotel suggested we rent a van for the entire day. It was about $120 US and it was totally worth it. The driver took us to the ruins and then he took us to a very secluded beach that might have been one of the nicest beaches I have ever been to. (And I've traveled all over the world, Asia, Australia, Mediterranean, etc...) The hotel's restaurant upstairs was cute and once again, the staff were all very welcoming and gracious.

The Hotel's location was great. A close enough walk to the main pedestrian area (5th Ave) and we also ventured to Wal-Mart a few blocks away and stocked up on beer, snacks, etc. Our small min-fridge in the room was perfect.

And so want to go back to Playa Del Carmen! We had an excellent time. We stayed at Hotel Playa Del Karma. And what a great choice it was! We based the decision on the hotel's reviews and we were not dissappointed. The hotel: very intimate and cosy. Quiet (which is just what we needed after a day at the beach), but close to all the action of the lively 5th Avenue. The room: basic but clean and cool (AC in a good order). Big and very comfortable bed! I had the best sleep ever. The garden: excellent! You can hardly remember you are actually in a middle of a busy town. And what a lovely pool (love the evening lights!). The breakfast: simple, but tasty. You have to try the cinnamon coffee! For a little extra you can indulge in fantastic fruit pancakes or filling omelette or scrumbled eggs. The choice is actually bigger, but we tried those three and they were all delicious. The beach: beautiful! Mamitas Beach Club - superb. The best tuna sandwiches ever! Worth the 15min walk. Trips: we went to Chichen Itza. Although the drive was long (2hrs one way) and the transport uncomfortable - it was totally worth it! And last but not least: The service - professional, but relaxed. Very friendly staff always willing to help. Our special big 'Gracias' goes to Mario who is always ready with a good advice and very helpful at all times. A bit of a problem with communication at times (ie. we weren't told that Sunday breakfast is actually not in the hotel), but if happens - they know how to make it up for you. Thanks again for letting me keep the book! It definitely made the long flight quicker. Also: Try Tequila Barrel for food and Bar Fah at Siesta Fiesta Hotel for live music and drinks!

We were looking for a nice little hotel for the first few days of relaxation and Playa del Karma was exactly it. When we arrived my first impression was somewhat disappointing, as the hotel doesn't look that hot on the outside. Once you're in though, it feels like you are living in nature. Vegetation is wild! There are so many trees and flowers everywhere! The hotel location is pretty ok - not too far from the beach, very near 5th avenue, so everything important is within easy reach. The hotel offers two different types of accommodation: regular rooms or palapas (small huts). We went for the palapa. The room was very picturesque and we were welcomed with flowers and fruit. Towels were fashioned like swans, which we found very nice. The room was comfortable with basic furniture, and a nice little porch with a hammock to rest on. My only objection concerning the rooms is that they had this stale smell of mold, which wouldn't go away. The ceiling fan worked very well - the air conditioning was also operating but should definitely be upgraded to a newer model. Generally, the hotel grounds were peaceful and quiet. Breakfast buffet was pretty basic, but we knew that so no problem. There were also extra -plain decent -delicacies one could order from the menu for a surcharge. The personnel were all very friendly and helpful, and we felt really welcome. The pool is really small but it was refreshing enough for a quick dip before dinner. There were some dinner parties at the hotel (once a week), and we had the chance to have a fish dinner there which was really great. The food was excellent and we received extra nice treatment. The hotel offered some spa treatments which i found a little expensive. My husband and i decided we could spoil ourselves a bit so we tried them once - the therapists were very caring and nice, grounds were spotless, therapies on the other hand didn't have any real effect, which means that we could have the same on any 5th avenue parlour for half the price. The great advantage of this particular hotel was that it wasn't near any construction sites (new hotels were being built by the dozen at the time) so we were not disturbed at all.", "Date": "September 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cGreat time!!\u201d", "Author": "PaulenLindsey", "ReviewID": "UR19852374", "Content": "We finished our Yucatan-Guatamala tour with 3 nights at Playa del Karma and really enjoyed the friendly atmosphere!

Nothing you would aspect if you stand on the busy road in the front, but this accommodation is quiet and just 2 blocks from 5th Avenue. The continental breakfast on the patio is okay, and every morning you are tempted to order something extra from their delicious and healthy breakfast a la cartemenu. Try the fresh juices!!! The prices are reasonable. On Friday night you can join their 4 course dinner, prepared with love and an Italian touch.

Even a week later, the memory makes me smile. I will confess that upon checkin, I don't think I could have been much more tired, so I can't tell you much about that, except that due to my exhaustion I could hardly remember my Spanish but still had no trouble with checkin. Location On 15th avenue, between 12th and 14th streets. To get to the 'action' you would walk down 12th or 14th, cross 10th avenue and then get to 5th avenue--the main shopping/restaurant/bar/clubs spot. The beach is one block further east. It probably took us 3-5 minutes to get to 5th avenue. 5th avenue is pedestrian only, so no cars. Although technically you could park 'closer' (if spots are available), once you are at PDK, just walk. Parking Ok to park in \"white\" painted curbs. Not OK to park next to \"yellow\" painted curbs. It appears the rule is at least one wheel in \"white\" makes you in the clear, but we didn't chance it. There is room for perhaps 4 cars on 15th directly across from PDK. We were never so lucky. Take the next right onto 12th and there is parking on both sides of the street (church on your left, school on your right). We almost always found parking here. There was also parking on 14th, west of 15th avenue, about equidistant. Roads Avenues run North and South. Streets run East and West. Most topas were marked. Stoplights have the green light flash to warn you it's about to turn yellow. Yellows are extremely short. The Courtyard and atmosphere Going through the streetfront entrance room leads to a larger courtyard that you would imagine prior to walking in. The courtyard is full of vegetation and a smaller pool. Rooms are on all four sides of the courtyard, but I'm not sure if any guests are given the room above the front desk checkin. Our room was on the \"right\" side going in, which is a row of single story, palapa thatched roof units with a nice skylight that lets the daylight in, but no one can see in or out. [It's not a skylight that you can watch the clouds through]. In front of each of these palapa units hangs a hammock on your own porch, which I used each evening before dinner. A nice point is that each of the porches has a bamboo-looking fence on each side so when we had neighbors, we didn't have to have them staring at us. From inside the courtyard, even during the main traffic times, it was very quiet. We heard a couple different kinds of birds each morning and evening, and heard church bells each morning from the church catycorner across the street. We found it amusing that the church bells were neither a song nor any particular number of rings--but just ringing for a while. The Room Inside our room, there was a single chest of drawers, an L shaped table, and a dorm-room sized refrigerator filled with 'for sale' drinks and snacks. The room had a 'you-program-the-code' safe to store your valuables, and a 5 foot wide by roughly 12 foot long bathroom that had a walk-in shower (no door) at the end. Even though my wife and I are quite slender, the narrowness made shifting positions in the bathroom a little difficult. [Not that the 2 of us minded, but you couldn't be in a hurry]. It took some time to get hot water, but that's probably b/c our unit was basically in the middle of the line of palapa units, and it was never oh-so-long that I ever thought they ran out. They did not run out of hot water, and it was plenty hot. I could have been happier with a little more water pressure though. The bed was a King size (I think), and I loved it, my back was never sore. My wife thought it was too hard, but we both slept soundly. I saw a complaint on this site about the lighting being too dim. I'll agree it was \"dim\" compared to a US hotel room, but it was bright enough there would not be any shadows in the room when the lights were on, you could read if you wanted to, and no danger of running into anything. Perhaps the difference is we were in a single bed room....It was very quiet in the room/entire hotel at night. We slept a couple days with the windows open and the first sounds we heard in the morning were the church bells. No dogs barking, no late night parties (and no roosters, thankfully). Breakfast The rooms come with a continental breakfast consisting of: coffee, tea, water, juice, cereal in little boxes with milk, toast, and a little sweetbread (usually chocolate). We got the feeling they wanted us to purchase the reasonably priced for the locale breakfasts, which looked very good. I'm not much of a breakfast person, so I never had one. They quit asking after a few days. Maid Service Overall, I can only give them an excellent rating. They remade the bed each day, gave us new towels wrapped into some shape, replaced the small bottle of water, and wiped down the sink. Everything always looked clean. An added plus was the day someone-whose-name-will-go-unmentioned left the safe open, and the maid left the cash and passports alone. Thanks! I must say I have very good thoughts about that maid. Recommendations We asked the staff for food recommendations after trying to guess a place on our own the first night. After one night of following PDK's advice, we only went to their recommended choices the rest of the week. Most were fantastic, the rest were simply very good. We've never had such good eating at so many different places. All in all, we loved it.

You have spoiled me and other establishments could and should take lessons from you. You are doing a very demanding work and have to compose with all sorts of clients and situations but I have to say that you responded with an efficiency that makes me admire you. As for the dog who was suppose to be barking every night and waking up other reviewers it must of left town because I never heard it during the 12 nights I stayed there. As for the breakfast I had the opportunity to sample Beppo and Max cooking .Try the banana pancakes made by the very able and charming Max.
