I wonder how the Spanish rating system works, as the 4* hotel I stayed in Barcelona far surpassed this hotel. I would put this hotel as a low 3*. The rooms were small. Nasty stain on our carpet. Not much storage space (which was fine as we were only there for 4 nights, but any longer would have proved a problem). The false ceiling tiles jumped up everytime the door opened or closed, then dropped with a bang, we were told not to worry about that! The beds were comfortable. The shower was a troublesome to say the least, every which way you tried, you managed to douse the bathroom floor with gallons of water. Our towels were generally used for mopping the floor, as opposed to drying ourselves! Although in the middle of the City, the room was quiet and sleep came easily.

We got into the main train station and then took the Metro to the Santo Domingo stop. We were a little turned around at first so we actually wound up walking the Gran Via and after we figured out we needed to head in the other direction, we finally found the hotel. The first thing that stuck out was the large trash containers up front. There was construction debris in them and when I saw the plastic on the floor, I knew what we were in for. The price we got should have also been an indicator, but since I'm a morning person, I figured this wouldn't be a problem. It wound up being more of an issue for my buddy than me. When we checked in we asked about it and they told us what time we could expect noise, but it wound up being earlier. From what we saw, the changes were going in a good direction. The lobby was nice and contemporary in style. The person who checked us in was nice and professional. We wound up getting one of the newer rooms, so for the price we were happy. Even the new hallways were pretty cool. The room itself was nice and large with 2 twin size comfy beds, a large dresser/armoire/closet IKEA looking thing, desk with chair, and flat screen TV. The whole decor was in a contemporary style, even the bathroom, which was nice and large. The shower was pretty cool since it was a full body wall spray system. Our room was on the 3rd floor and faced the street, so the construction noise in the morning was noticeable. If not for that construction noise, I would have easily given this place a 'Very Good' rating.

The reception staff were extremely helpful & accomodating. We had 3 rooms, all of which were very small, which in itself was not a problem as we didnt go to Madrid to stay in the room all day. The main issue we had was with the bathroom. They had glass walls & a glass door (lightly frosted) - there was no way of closing the bathroom door properly, never mind locking it. We had to prop the shut with the waste paper basket. This could be really annoying- as our bathroom opened directly out to the bedroom, so you felt as if you could be seen while in the bathroom, where as our friends in the other rooms had their bathroom door opening out into the \"corridor\" part of their bedrooms. That said the bathroom was nearly as big as the bedroom , the shower as we had read in previous reviews flooded the floor before you even got into it. This was extremely annoying to say the least. We also felt that there could have been a mirror in the bedroom, but we had just the one in the bathroom. This hotel is clean & comfortable & we had no major complaints, however I would not reccomend it to friends purely on the bathroom issue, as I found it annoying. WE didnt book the breakfast package, so we cannot comment on it.

No porter around to help with luggage or take me to room which is never a good sign. Staff were ok, serious & pleasant not particularly chatty and always seemed busy. Room on 2nd floor at rear of hotel overlooking the construction site next door so no view. suprisingly, very quiet apart from occasional shouting amongst the builders. Did get a bit airless at times, so needed window open even though cold outside. The room initially felt small but soon got used to it. Cupboards were cheap and cramped, like something you'd buy from Ikea for a childs room. Not much space for my suit,shirts and stuff. Plasma TV but lacked variety of channels - no movies in English only CNN/Sky , yawn. The laptop in room is a great idea. Really impressed with that although it was full of pop ups, cookies and other nasty bugs (along with a very full pc history folder, the adult content of which I daren't mention!). A secure room safe which was very useful. Really needed tea/coffee making facilities in room! Bathroom - Good points: Modern, roomy, great shower that everyone mentions (water still floods out as shower has no door ) and always very clean. The lighting in the corridors is ridiculous, just like a night club (as some other reviewer said!) it's dark, purple, pretentious and impossible to see clearly, bet the Health & Safety Dept would have a fit if they saw it. Breakfast was a sad affair really. Located in a tiny area next to reception that looked like an afterthought. The offerings weren't that great - fruit, rolls, slices of meat but the luke warm scrambled eggs & fatty bacon were my usual, more from routine than appetite. At least you don't feel tempted to over eat and spend too long there. Didn't seem to be any room service? I live on room service on business trips so this was a big inconvenience for me. Can't eat out every night so ended up with sandwiches in room, no wonder I lost so much weight! The Business Centre - mmm, it's just a desk with a pc on it next to reception...not exactly a thriving, bustling hub of corporate activity. Maybe I missed it and it's on another floor? Hotel location was excellent as I needed the metro every day. Good for shops, cinemas, theatres etc and the street's not too noisy.

It's rather difficult to sleep with the smell of cleaning products. Secondly, the worst part of our stay with this hotel was the unfriendly staff, specifically the front desk. We requested a wake up call and confirmed it twice to ensure with the shift changes that our request was put in the system. The day of departure we did not get our wake up call!! This caused us to miss our international flight! When asked what happened to our wake up call, they simply replied that they received the busy signal indicating the phone was off the hook (completely untrue). They didn't even bother going up to our room to check or knock on our door which goes to show their indifference. If anyone requests a 4:00am wake up call and a taxi, this should be taken seriously.

Bathroom very comfortable, however with that glass-half door on the shower which seems to be so common in Spanish hotels - I've never learned how to navigate not soaking the floor, and I did that again (in particular when I tried the fab full-body shower). The bathroom is separated off by a smoked glass front wall - I guess one could have privacy issues if sharing a room - but it really is not transparent at all, barely translucent. I got an excellent rate of 99 euros booking online through a service - would definitely come here again. Breakfast was not included in price.

The bed was very comfortable and the full body shower was strong and warm! I speak a little Spanish and honestly the staff was super excited that I tried. The good news is that all of them spoke very good English so when my Spanish did fail me they could still help. As an example, one of the staff members (Jose I think) was able to book a reservation at the oldest restaurant in the world (Botin) with only a few hours notice. We still don't know how he did it because this place is always crowded. There were 2 computers with free internet that we used continuously and the food was good.

The hotel is small. The room had ultramodern decor and was immaculate (and we are quite fussy!). There was a laptop computer in the room with free internet access, a widescreen TV, free safe, 2 balconies coming off the room and a hydromassage shower which was fantastic. Some of the other reports I read say that the shower floods the bathroom - I think the hotel has tried to get around this problem by erecting a plastic sheet inside the shower cubicle. This did work but kept falling down which was a little annoying! Breakfast was not included in the rate but would have been 10 euros per person per day but we did not take this as there are so many little places close by to grab something to eat (in particular a churros y chocolate which must not be missed when in Madrid!).
