We booked a double room, as we came in we got a superior room. Nice big room at the ground floor in the garden, it looked the perfect room, but...... becouse of the nice weather the first evening there were a group of guests in the garden speaking, laughing and screaming very loud until deep in the night, bye bye night rest! Our room was also right next to the breakfast room so early in the morning around 6 o clock the staff was preparing breakfast, that was a lot of noise through the thin walls... so our first night was not so good. the following morning we asked another room who was quiet, that was no problem, there was only a double room available, but no problem for us if we could get a normal sleep! The room was clean and comfy and the rests of the nights we sleep very well. The breakfast was not included in our room and pretty expensive, 10 euro per person, one morning we eat breakfast in the hotel, despite the costs the food was good, loved the fresh pineapple! But... a one minute walk from the hotel (direction of the metro) there is a nice spot where you can buy your breakfast, fresh croissants, and a lot of choices in sandwiches, they were soooo nice, also cheap, 11 euro for 2 sandwiches and 2 fresh orange juice, take it to your room and enjoy breakfast at your balcony. The hotel is near the Blue metro line, 2 minutes walk, yes in the evening there are prostitues working across the street, and at the gas station, but they never bother you. The hotel has also a hotel bar/restaurant were they serve nice red wine!

Breakfast - we only took the breakfast once, eggs were cold, fruits were dry and canned, Orange juice tasted sour. avoid breakfast and go into some nice cafe. Peppy's bar near Bernini Station has awesome snacks, tea, coffee. We went there twice just for their vast selection of pastries :) Room Service- We ordered dinner on our first day, again a terrible mistake.

The Pulitzer is located 2 minutes walk from a metro station that takes you to the heart of Rome in 15 minutes. The metro costs 1 euro per trip, so not bad at all. The hotel is located in a very quiet middle class neighborhood, it is not a dangeraus place, but not very lively. We saw the prostitutes other reviers mentioned once at a gas station, but they minded their own business and kept at the back at the station waiting for their clientele. There were posters all over the street where you could see the local community was mobilizing to have them out of there, so there is a debate going on. They did not bother us at all. The hotel itself is very stylish, confortable, beds were great, air conditioner very good, sky with italian and international channels, bathroom was good too and the furniture itself is all new.

At the Colosseum we had a lovely snack and drink in a little bar called La Bigga which looked out onto the Colosseum and wasnt expensive. Be warned at the Colosseum there are men dressed as Gladiators getting you to take pics with them, but once you have done this they will ask for money.

For our stay in Rome, we were looking for a small designer hotel with a good value for money, so the Pulitzer was chosen on basis of solid reviews, fair price for superior double room with a breakfast (90 EUR/day) and nice on-line pics. Arrival from Rome rail station Termini to the hotel is easy: only 7 metro stations (1 EUR ticket) and takes about 15 minutes. And here is first \"but\": metro connection is excellent during the day, but it stops at 23.30 p.m. We thought that will not be a problem for us but beautiful centre of Rome kept us there until late at night - we were always worrying how we will get back to the hotel without relatively expensive taxi (20-25 EUR from the centre to the hotel). Traveler tip: if you are going in Rome as a tourist, pick accommodation in centre - you'll be able to enjoy Rome more. Rome is best explored on foot since the main attractions are on walking distance. Hotel lobby is very nice and stylish. Staff was also polite and they gave us all information we needed - they spoke English well. Room service&cleaning was also on high level. Air-condition was working perfectly so it was really refreshing to enter into the hotel on a hot August days. Our room was spacious but we were a little bit disappointed with it's condition: yes, it is well designed but it is damaged of use and needs renovation ASAP. Some furniture pieces were broken, wooden floor was in a not so nice condition (high-heel trails all over) and curtains could use a better cleaning. Bathroom on the other hand was very clean and modern so that is a big plus! Lot of shampoos and bathroom accessories made it extremely pleasant. Large and comfy bad made us sleep like angels after all day walks in Rome. Air-condition in room was working perfectly. Unfortunately, we did not get a private balcony as we asked during a booking so we had to share a terrace with other guests. Good thing is that other guests in Pulitzer seems to be nice people so that was not a problem. Also, we did not spend much time there because the view is bad - only 15-20 meters from some residential buildings. Better view is on a street side of the hotel - however, there is very busy 6-line road which means noise, smell, dust etc. Free wifi looks good on paper but in reality it did not work on my NOKIA smartphone. Receptionist told me it is due some technical reasons and that it works great with laptops. When I asked to use internet on hotel's laptops in cafeteria, he told me that it costs 6 EUR per hour. Minus! C'mon - in 21st. century they are charging for approach to internet. In my humble opinion it's a robbery because flat rate Internet and PCs are so cheap now-days that there is really no need to charge for that - it's like additional charging for electricity or water used in room. Some nice stuff again: the breakfast was excellent. So many choices including various fresh fruits, beautiful dining room and decorations, free newspapers, real orange juice (not the one mixed with water like in wannabe nice hotels), yummy food... we were really happy going on breakfast. And a couple of words on \"red light\" neighbourhood: on busy street in front of the hotel is a \"pick-up area\" for prostitutes, but only in evening. It is not delightful scenery if you are with family so that is a minus. However, hotel facilities are not involved or used for prostitute's activities and their presence did not affect to our stay in the hotel. Finally, I have to say I will not go back to the hotel Pulitzer in Rome: it is not because of hotel itself (hotel is actually really nice, only some improvement are needed) - but it is because it is not in a walking distance from city centre.

The metro in Rome is so crowded and the two lines only run to a certain time. So the only other choice to get to and from Pulitzer is by taxi. So yes, you will be spending the money you saved on the hotel room on taxi fares. Just not worth it.

We were invitied to a reception at the bar the first night we arrived. -Free WiFi. -5-8mins walk to the Marconi Metro (underground/tube) stationed, which is well linked to Termini and other popular tourist destinations (Vatican etc.) -Direct bus service into town - bus stop right in front of hotel. -Helpful front desk service and responsive room service. -15 paces from the hotel is a cafe serving up small eats and good coffee. -10-15 mins walk is a large grocery store (Carfour) and a neighbourhood eatery. -Not located in the mad tourist trap area - we chose this place specifically because of this - being walking distance to a Metro station meant we could get everywhere really quickly. -There are a lot of good neighbourhood eateries around the other Metro stations (before Marconi station stop), that serve up better food than the ones near the tourist draws, and way more affordable. -Though we checked out at 12pm, our flight was later in the day. We were able to leave our luggage in the reception office and do our last bit of sight seeing. Cons - It was November and about 22 deg celcius. We found it a little warm but was unable to use the air-conditioning. For some reason it had been turned off or not working. This was a minor inconvenience - we were able to open the windows and balcony doors to ventilate the room. I was a little apprehensive at first, when I read about street walkers turning up at the enterance of the hotel. We never saw any hovering around the hotel enterance, but we saw 2 or 3 standing by the road side - they weren't even on the kerb. Also the walkway between the tube station and hotel is fairly well lit. We didn't feel fearful walking back to the hotel in the evenings.

They put cardboard or something inside to catch the change coming out to steal it from you so just move to a machine that doesn't have swarms of gypsies around it!!

Hotel is very modern looking, Id say the website looks a lot nicer than its property itself. The hotel is well decorated, and it is around 1 min walk to the metro station. ( like 3 stations away from Pyramid station, where you can change there to take the train to the Fiumicino Airport). It is pretty close to the Colloseo as well. The hotel is a little bit out of the CENTER of the city. but its not far and its pretty convenient. Room size is good, but toilet is a bit small. We stayed there for 3 nights. The first night we arrived at 9 pm and there were no restaurants near by so we had to eat at the bar. Don't know whether it was late or the staff just had pure bad attitude. The service wasn't that friendly and the barman just gave me a ' oh look at me, im so tired after a long day of work just order!!!\" face. 2nd day: I put the \"please clean my room\" sign on my door, and when i came back to the hotel, it was turned the other way saying\" please do not disturb\". Housekeeping didn't clean my room and turned out we had no clean towels. Receptionists went to back office and found NO towels and had no keys to access the storage. At the end we had to go to the guest toilet and took all the 'hand towels' ( like 10 mini towels the size of an A4 paper) and used that to dry us up after shower. There were two receptionists, one was really helpful, trying to look and see how to help us, but the other one just told me' you shouldn't have put the sign on , they'll clean the room\" .Felt like i was the one to blame that housekeeping didnt' clean my room and the hotel does not have back up towels... Besides the towel and barman problem, everything was good. I reflected my towel problem with another receptionist when i checked out and he waived my spendings at the bar which was very nice of him. Afterall its not the hotels fault, i guess the housekeeping is hired from another company to do the cleaning and leaves in the afternoon.

This meant that we had to have the semi sheer curtains closed all of the time otherwise anyone passing by could have looked down into our room. Apart from this the room was adequate for our needs so we did not complain and try to change to another room. The booking did not include breakfast but we paid 50% more last time so we did not mind foregoing the breakfast, or the larger room. The bed was huge and whilst it was a little firm for me, a quick discussion with the member of staff on Reception resulted in an additional duvet being provided which I used as a mattress topper - perfect. We slept really well. The location of the hotel away from the city centre means that it was quiet with very little traffic noise during the night (but only 7 metro stops from Termini). The bathroom had a shower over the bath which had a shower head which could also be hand held; I dislike fixed shower heads. There is room in the minibar to chill a bottle of wine should you bring one back to the room but no tea and coffee making factilities unless you take your own kettle like we did.

First of all, the room isn't new as it seemed on web, the wooden floor is old and cracked everywhere in the room, and it was dusty, which gave me a very poor first impression while entering the room. Then it was about the lack of air-conditioning!! OMG, can you imagine paying over 120 Euro to stay in a hotel without air-con?? Luckily the weather is not burning right now, but to avoid the flies, we can't open windows/door of the terrace, which essentially means we are being forced to suffocate. Nonetheless the TV reception was so poor and the speed of internet was so slow too. When we called at reception to complain about the air-con, the gal said it has been broken down for the ENTIRE WEEK, and they can do nothing about that (not even to provide some free drinks at mini-bar to cool us down!), and they sounded that they are NOT going to do anyth to ease the situation or to at least pacify the guests. Worst enough, we have to turn the lights off inside our room to avoid being over-heated. Come on, such condition can be worst enough to compare with sleeping at hostels and those hotel paying much less. We would feel a lot better if we were being notified before we arrive or during our check-in, but NO, sounded like they try to cover this up not until the guests discover it themselves and then you are left with no choice but to tolerate such situation.

So~ when I am provided with that same excellent experience I am certain to give credit where it is due! This was my 2nd trip to Rome, this time traveling with a girlfriend. This hotel is not only beautiful & comfortable but also convenient. The metro stop is literally 2 blocks away. It took us 7 stops (10 min) to get to termini, 20 min to get to the Vatican. If coming from the airport, take a train to Pirimide and then hop on the metro from there. It is 5 Euros vs. 11 Euros for the Leonardo express and you will save yourself a lot of time and effort. I should also mention you are a 23 minutes (40 Euro) cab ride to Fuicimico. We arrived and were quickly checked in. A chilled bottle of procceso was awaiting us. We called down and asked for 2 more pillows and Wi-Fi access, no problem & Wi-Fi was free. Our room was plenty big for 2 gals with 2 LG suitcases and they even had 2 suitcase racks in the room. Bed was SUPER comfy, as were the sheets. The bath was modern and even had a REAL hairdryer for us gals to use. The concierge made all our dinner reservations for us ahead of time via email, helped with public transport, and never made us feel any less then truly welcome. After 4 nights we left for Turkey, but were returning before departing for home. We loved this hotel and its staff so much; we booked our last night here as well. The hotel gladly honored the SAME rate! If I HAD to point out something less than perfect. (I am stressing HAD) The breakfast was only ok. But I am nit picking here.

There's also a post box right on the way to the metro for all those Colliseum postcards! I never felt unsafe whatsoever during the three minute walk. The hotel is located at the Marconi stop of the B (blue) line. It's about 8 or so stops to Rome Termini and takes maybe 15 minutes or so. When exiting the metro station, turn left and walk about 800 feet. The hotel is on a corner on the left side of the street. Served from 7:30 until 10, the breakfast was the best we had out of all the hotels we stayed in. There were fresh orange, honeydew, orange, pineapple, and kiwi slices; sliced smoked turkey cold cuts and deli cheeses, eggs and bacon; rolls, breads, and croissants; a few different cereals and milk; whole fruit; small baguette sandwiches; a few different juices, coffee, and water; and nice jams and other condiments. The breakfast staff was pleasant and the decor, matching up with the rest of the hotel, was quite modern. They had some interesting modern music playing too, it was kind of techno-esque, but nothing was played loud enough to bother anyone. I didn't even notice it until halfway through my first breakfast. Most breakfasts included with hotel rooms in Italy seemed to be some breads, butter and jam, and coffee. This was the first and only that offered a heartier selection. The room was nicely decorated and we had a small balcony. The bathroom was above average for an Italian bathroom. Black tile with white fixtures. It had a full tub, which was a first, that had this odd half shower door on it. Other than a little water on the floor, it worked just fine. Good water pressure and all, nice detachable-type shower head. The toilet and bidet were rectangular but they worked the same as their oval counterparts. The bed was comfortable, a little more supple than some of the very firm (hard) mattresses in other hotels. Don't get me wrong, it couldn't ever be confused for saggy or too soft. Nice little minibar in the room with some five ounce glass bottle Coke and Sprite for four euros each. Everything in the hotel is pretty much brand new with a very modern decor. Interestingly enough, all pictures on one wall were put right next to each other in a big rectangle on the wall. It was very odd, but I ended up liking it.

The rooms are nice, well designed and we even had a large balcony which was nice. There was also a gym which we used every day and appreciated. Breakfast was quite good too. If you find yourself there at dinner time, the hotel restaurant was a ghost town, probably as a result of the prices, but there is a great little neighborhood place nearby, Il Pepperocino or something like that. Again, the walk to get there was a little dodgy, but once you got there is was great, just locals and very fun and full of energy with good food.

It cost about 30 Euros to get there by cab from Fiumicino, and be sure to print out the address, as it's new and many cab drivers don't yet know the name. The hotel only opened a few months ago, and it still looks and feels new, with a high standard of fixures and fittings. The lobby is nice, the staff extremely helpful. They took in courier deliveries for us and stored everything in their offices for our arrival. Check in was a touch slow, but was friendly. The lifts are nice and quite fast. Rooms are nice - they have single rooms at reasonable prices, helpful for business travellers - as well as double and twin rooms. Some of the rooms have nice balconies. Air con works well. Everything very clean. Breakfast good - self service and loads of choice. The meeting room that we booked was excellent - nicely furnished and a good size. The food was good, and staff were helpful about bringing more drinks etc. However - the kitchens are only open until 11pm, and after that it's impossible to get any more drinks or snacks, not even water - we ended up raiding our room minibars for coke, water and crisps when our meeting went on late. Only one area where they really need to improve - internet and business facilities. The internet is advertised as being fast - it's NOT. It's extremely slow, so you can barely access hotmail, never mind download files or access virtual desktops. And they don't have a business centre, so no photocopier, no printer, no paper, no envelopes, no CD-Rs, nothing - you'll need to take everything you need with you. During normal hours, staff were helpful with providing sellotape and paperclips, but that's about it. Although I really liked it as a hotel, I'm not sure I'd stay again - the metro stop is 10 mins walk away, so you can get into the city fairly easily (or 15 euros by cab), but you feel really off the beaten track here, so it may not be ideal for tourists. The nearest ATM is a half hour walk away, or in the city. And without good internet, it's not really ideal for business travellers.
