The staff were all very welcoming and the lobby area was gorgeous. The hotel is right in the heart of downtown Montreal so you're not far from major shopping and lots of restaurants. The room itself was amazing! The decor was great; modern for the most part. We loved the layout, especially the sliding doors that allowed for unrestricted view of the gorgeous bathroom. You can also opt to keep the doors shut for privacy. The bathroom....wow...the bathroom was beyond awesome. The tub was absolutely massive and there was a flatscreen tv for watching while you relax in a bubblebath. The shower is separate and very roomy. All the normal amenities were provided; bars of soap, shampoo, conditioner, bubble bath, towels, etc. There is a dimmer switch in the bathroom as well to provide a little romantic mood lighting if desired. The bed was very clean and super comfy. There was something not right about the pillows though. I'm not really sure what the deal is but they were not comfortable at all and I truly wish I brought my own with me. We didn't have any noise issues on that floor which was great. We had trouble with the thermostat, I couldn't get it to adjust at all. We checked out the pool area, which is very nicely done but didn't have our swimsuits so we didn't get to try it. I did notice that the water was warm, so while the pool isn't large enough for the kiddies to play, it's great for a relaxing soak I think. All in all, we had a stay minus the pillows.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Coquitlam", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Wendy B", "ReviewID": "UR127811006", "Content": "I recently stayed at Le St. Martin hotel in Montreal.

When we checked out, the person at the front desk asked us about our additional charges - breakfast at the restaurant and a pop from the mini fridge. We confirmed the breakfast but told her that we did not touch the fridge, and she nodded and proceeded to check us out. I thought it was all handled from here. However, a month later, my credit card statement shows a charge of $3something - for the pop is my guess. I think this is shows that there is a big flaw in their process: Do they really assume that we would pay for a meal but not admit that we had taken a pop from the mini fridge? And therefore feel justified to charge us anyways, without informing us and without checking if there might be another reason? I don't care about the $3sth that was charged to my credit card so I won't bother calling them but it has definitely soured my experience - who's to say they will not do this for other things? We have stayed many times at the St. Le-Martin in Laval and the service there is VERY different. We actually had a problem with one of the in-room movies when we stayed in February (same trip). They made the effort of informing us that their movie provider did not acknowledge a problem with the video sound and still wanted to charge, but that they would talk to them again to discuss it. But they cautioned us that a charge might appear. See the difference? My original review is below: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Great location (for the winter), great room, great weekend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Reviewed 21 February 2012 I tend to go to Montreal at least once a year and while in the summer I prefer to stay near Old Montreal, winter time is a different matter entirely. This time we choose to stay with the Le St-Martin Hotel since we've always had a lovely experience at the Laval one and found a great deal through SniqueAway. For anyone who wants to walk (even in the winter!) this is a great location - it's right next to the Peel metro station, steps away from the main underground shopping area (Simons, Centre Mont-Royal), a 10-min walking distance to the Fine Arts museum, Crescent Street, and Mont-Royal Park and a 20-minute walk to St Laurant & Sherbrooke. We stayed in the one of the Grand Lux rooms which was clean and comfortable. There seems to be a trend in boutique hotels these days to have a open concept - the bathroom (incl. big soaker tub) was separated from the sleeping area only by a few sliding wooden doors (blinds), so I would not recommend this room to share with friends or colleagues. Nice touches: two temperature controls (one in the bathroom, one for the sleeping area), LCD screen mounted over the bathtub (sadly, we did not have the time to try it out), turndown service, desk table that had two levels of brightness and could be turned on by touch. The fitness room was small and narrow but comfortable and did not feel too enclosed since one wall was all window (it overlooks a parking lot). Good fitness equipment although there is only one treadmill, one elliptical, one bike and one weight machine. We took a look at the outdoor pool but did not have a chance to try it out. Reception and service in the restaurant was good but not noteworthy.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cNot Bad..\u201d", "Author": "starseed21", "ReviewID": "UR126385885", "Content": "My mom, sister and I stayed here for a girls-weekend in February. Great location close to Simons and an entrance to the underground mall was right next door too! If you're into shopping this is probably a prime location to stay. The rooms were spacious and very chic. There was a window from the shower to the bedroom which was interesting. We had a good laugh at it as none of us travellers had seen this before. In my sister's words: This totally takes 'Peeping Tom' to a new level. It was funny. The beds weren't my favorite but at the same time I wouldn't complain. The decor was probably my favorite part. Who ever picked the interior I would gladly hire to do my own home haha. In the halls there were bowls with asian pear apples - such a nice touch I find. We didn't have any coffee pods in the room so we called down for them. Unfortunately for us they only brought us one. I feel that coffee is the least you can provide in a room so I wasn't overly impressed by this. Staff on the other hand could have stood to be a bit friendlier.. When asking for advice on what to do and where to go eat they didnt seem to have any hidden gems or anything great. I travel to Montreal for work so I've had the opportunity to poke around and find a few neat things that we went back to. I would have loved to make the connection and get an idea for booking my staff into this hotel but unfortunately with each person at the front this conversation was near impossible to establish.

There is not a lot of room around the bed but the room feels good. It has a modern, luxurious look everyone expect. Flat TV, ipod radio clock, power surge protected outlet on the desk.

I might become handy but you would need to know this if going with someone else. At night I found the place very noisy, it was not the elevators but constant ventilation or neighbors door shutting was annoying.

My wife and I are young couple (early 20s) who were staying at Le St-Martin for a weekend getaway for Valentine's Day. We stayed from a Friday night thru Sunday morning. I'll now break down the individual ratings I gave with what I hope to be helpful information in each category. Service: We arrived shortly after 9:00pm entered the lobby. After providing check-in information a bellhop retrieved our bags and escorted us to our room. I turned over the car-keys and he provided me with a valet ticket. So, the entire check-in/valet process may have taken all of 4 minutes- rather impressive, but again, it was 5 hours after typical check-in. During our stay, our room was only serviced once, but that was largely on us, as we spent the better part of the day Saturday just hanging out in the room. Back to the valet service- upon leaving for dinner on Saturday night and checking out Sunday morning, our car was retrieved in a speedy 2 minutes each time. Another thing- I'm not positive, but I suspect that the parking lot to the rear of the hotel is not the lot used for the valet. The reason I say this is because throughout the entire weekend, the temp never went above 20*F, but when the car was retrieved, the door handles, steering wheel and seats were all warm as if the car was being kept out of the elements in a covered garage somewhere. Value: Value was excellent, but I'll tell you why. I was able to book the Verriere (Superior) Suite for $180/night due to the last-minute nature of our trip. Booking this room through the property itself will run you $245/night on the same weekend. So then, the reason I only gave a \"Very Good\" rating for value was because a huge part of that was the savings I received through the travel site. Mini-bar was typical- $3 for a Coke, $6 for a beer, $7.50 for a nip of liquor. The valet service will run you $23 per night+tax+tips, which, unless you use it at least twice a day, seems a little steep to me, especially since you really don't have any other options for car-parking. Sleep Quality: I slept fantastically on the King-sized bed we had. Definitely not a cheap-hotel bed either, probably a Simmons or something. We had four pillows between the two of us, with two additional HUGE throw pillows and a nice down comforter. I've seen other reviewers have issues with street noise but we were on the 3rd floor and I didn't think it was that bad in the later hours. Keep in mind though, it was February and freezing cold out for our entire stay. Cleanliness: The room was spotless upon arrival and when cleaned on Saturday morning spotless again. I'll group re-supply into this category as well since the maids are responsible for that. The mini-bar wasn't restocked, which, for us wasn't really an issue but if you're the type of traveler who relies on it, take this into account. Either way, it comes fully loaded with 8 cans of soda, 3 beers, 8 nips of liquor, 3 bottles of wine 2 bottles of juice, a red bull and a bunch of chips and nuts and stuff so bleeding it dry would be a challenge. Location: This hotel is in what I consider to be a prime location. There's plenty of restaurants and shopping within short walking distance, even when it's only 10*F outside. For food, there's a Subway right across the street if you're looking for fast-food breakfast or lunch, and a couple Canadian chain joints 1 block to the southeast. The hotel is in Downtown so fine-dining is readily available as well, in pretty much every direction. Shopping is also very abundant in Downtown so if that's what you're in to, have at it. One cool tip I have for you is that if you head down Rue Metcalfe (down the hill to the right of the hotel entrance) you'll see a store called Simons on your left. Once you're in Simons, look around for an escalator that goes down a level. Take it down and you'll be in a massive underground network of shops and stores that stretches for around 4 blocks along Rue St. Catherine. As for the types of stores, think Levis and Old Navy rather than Louis Vuitton or Gucci. At the eastern most end, you have a positively enormous department store called Ailes. Best of all, it was warm underground. Rooms: I can really only speak for the Verriere Suite in terms of design and amenities, and this room has it all. The panoramic windows are an absolutely fantastic touch which make it hard to get out of bed in the morning. I should note though that the windows are adorned by Roman shades so they open and close but can not be put up or down. Even still, the view was very nice. Television is large, swivels, and has 25 channels (roughly 15 English/10 French). The bathroom has a VERY large soaking tub (no jets), another television(very cool) and a good-sized glass shower. Toiletries weren't name brand, but were still high-quality, including a \"glycerin soap bar\" which was a new and very enjoyable experience for me. The room came equipped with a Keurig machine which my wife thought was a fantastic amenity, although like the mini-bar items, the k-cups were never restocked so I would caution you to bring your own. Moving back into the bedroom, I want to be very clear about one amenity in this room- the fireplace. This was a huge draw for me when booking the room, but in reality, it's a little lackluster. For some reason, I was thinking it was a gas fireplace (in retrospect that would be a ridiculous liability for the hotel to assume), but it's actually an electric one that does not produce any heat. At any rate, it's not a tacky model and is a nice touch with the lights off and a view of the city. All in all, I can highly recommend this hotel based on location alone. Now, if the Verriere Suite is avaialable for less than $200/night, I would say it's an absolute no-brainer, and you will not be disappointed with the room.", "Date": "February 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cGreat Room!

Stayed two nights at the St-Martin. Room was lovely, having reserved the Classic King Foyer. Plenty of room, fireplace, clean. We were able to check into our room around noon which was helpful to get an early start to our day. Referrals for restaurants were excellent from the staff. We had a lovely breakfast Saturday morning but when we returned to the hotel after watching a game at the Bell Centre, we decided to stop for a drink in the restaurant, L'Aromate. We sat at the bar and ordered a drink. No music was playing until we sat down and then it was blaring. Others at the bar asked for the music to be lowered. The bartender agreed but within five minutes, some young man danced his way behind the bar to increase the volume and change the music (it was connected to the stereo on his iphone). This happened several times before my husband again asked for the volume to be lowered. There was no way we could have a conversation under those conditions. I don't mind loud music but if that's what I had wanted, we would have gone to a dance bar. This was a restaurant. Between this young man constantly changing songs, raising the level of music and glasses of champagne being smashed on the floor across from us, we stayed long enough to finish our drink. At least three other tables left around the same time. What seemed to be some sort of celebration in the restaurant took over the place, with servers drinking and dancing and completely ignoring the idea that this was a public restaurant with other patrons. In what seemed like a classy place, it quickly dropped to amateurish and rude. We complained to the bartender who basically threw up his hands in embarrassment. We complained to the front desk, who said it wasn't the first time they've received complaints about the restaurant. They did offer us coupons for a limited breakfast there the next day.

Nice extras like free bottled water and wi-fi, a free beverage and snack service in the evening- nice touch. But then there are the windows....I don't know if someone cut corners in construction (the Hotel is just over a year old) or what, but when we went to bed- so the room was quiet- you could hear EVERYTHING that was happening outside. It was as if the window was open- which it wasn't- they don't open! I have stayed in other Montreal hotels are equally busy streets- actually more busy streets- but never heard street noise in the room like this before- and we were on the 8th floor. I actually went to the window and you could feel air- and hear sound- streaming in along the bottom of the window. The cavity below the window also seemed hollow. This is also a walking route from the McGill student area to the downtown bars, so the street noise (esp. Fri & Sat) consists of frequent groups of screaming students from 11:00 PM to 4:00 AM, mixed in with sirens. Then the beeping of the delivery trucks start at 6 AM. Heck we could even hear dogs barking and people talking- from the sidewalk 8 stories below. 'm not sure, but something is definitely not right. Perhaps some spray foam and caulking could help? The only other disappointment was the exercise room- so small. The Crystal has them beat here (similar style, similar price).

Everything worth seeing seems to be within walking distance. It really was the perfect blend of boutique charm and the comfort of an upscale chain. Bathroom was roomy with double-vanity (marble counter!) and complete with Keurig cup coffeemaker-- nice touch. My only complaints would be that the bathrobes are somewhat rough, and the restaurant is way overpriced (we skipped it altogether, since Montreal is filled with more reasonable and diverse options). I also found it odd that the blackout curtains didn't extend across the length of our window, leaving a large gap in the center covered only with a sheer white drape. However, the light coming in didn't disrupt our sleep in the morning, so it worked out just fine.

It's about a block away from the nearest metro stop (Peel), although you probably don't need to take the subway to get to most attractions if you don't mind a bit of walking. It's about 5 blocks away from one of the main entrances into Parc du Mont Royal (at Rue Peel and Avenue des Pins Ouest), and it's a must visit on a nice day! Oh heck, that's not my only favorite thing about the hotel. I love their daily complimentary coffee brewer and bottled water refills - two things I need daily, their super firm yet fluffy pillows, and their workstation with desk top outlet (so you don't have to crawl under to plug/unplug). Standard room comes with a sizable shower stall, no bathtub, in case you're into that stuff... I could care less. Some previous reviews complained about the wifi. Let me just affirm that I haven't had any wifi connectivity issues during my entire stay here, and I used it daily. Wifi is consistent and relatively fast (although I didn't do any heavy downloading). It resets every 24hrs so you just need to reenter your room info to restart the cycle. The gym is on the 4th floor right by my room, which I never used. I took a peek and thought it was pretty small, but I really didn't have the need to run like a hamster on my vacay when I'm walking everywhere. The room service from the restaurant downstairs (L'Aromate) is prompt (but pricey as expected)! It took them 10-15min to deliver my food, and they were pretty tasty. The room cleaning service starts early. They'd be guaranteed to knock on my door by 9am if I didn't have a \"do not disturb\" sign out.

The pool is VERY SMALL, it's more off a jacuzzi with cold water and there is no possibility for suntanning. The reception staff is not friendly, but that's Montreal for you. The concierge staff was nice! Also the reservations manager was EXTREMELY RUDE and not accomodating on the phone and that really turned me off from going to the hotel initially. The breakfast was really good. The hotel is nice but overpriced, try to find a deal on it and then make it worth while.

It was glorious, the room (1409) was stunning with a huge bed that was so very comfy, large tv, mini bar and everything you could possibly need. The view of skyscrapers reflected in the building opposite was captivating. The bathroom was large and had both a two man bath tub and and a two man walk in shower, the bathroom itself opened up into the room which is a lovely idea. We both slept soundly as it was so quiet and comfortable. Room service was very prompt and all of the staff we encountered were friendly and very helpful. Sadly when we arrived back the next Saturday night (after spending a week in Quebec City) it was quite a different story. We had an early flight to Boston on the Sunday morning so decided that we'd stay here again and have a nice relax. We were given room 804, again the room itself was gorgeous and the bed and bathroom were exquisite but the noise was incredible. On the 14th floor we had been too high to hear anything but the eighth was awful!! The glazing on the windows was so thin that you may as well have been trying to sleep in the middle of the street. The main feature of the room was the window and the view but quite frankly the view was better on the 14th. The blinds on the window failed to shut out the light and the curtain only covered about a quarter of the backs of the blinds. I suppose it's called art but the room was totally light from dawn onwards so even if you had managed to nod off through the noise for a few hours you wouldn't have managed it for long. If you do choose to stay here refuse any room below the 12th Floor if you want any peace. Oh and I'd also make sure they haven't put any \"hen do\" parties on your floor too as they were also an isssue.", "Date": "July 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "new jersey", "Title": "\u201cwonderful newer hotel\u201d", "Author": "happyroadtravler", "ReviewID": "UR114886625", "Content": "This hotel was very convient to the downtown shopping area and some very good restaurants.

This hotel is located right downtown, so you would not come across many people who do not know English. It's conveniently located close to two metro stations, one is right across the street. Several shops and restaurants are also walking distance. My one criticism is the selection of room service. They offer breakfast and lunch/dinner options. However, the breakfast selection I felt was a little limited in that there are only about 7 or 8 choices all at the price of $17.95 plus tax and gratuity. Beverages are not included in the price, however there is a Krups coffee maker in the room. They offer you a caffeinated and decaffeinated option daily. If you'd like an additional cup, you must pay $1.50 or call room service for a $4.50 hot beverage, including tea! It would be great if they added more simple choices, such as a bagel or yogurt. There is an Eggspectation down the street I would recommend for breakfast instead. This is my main criticism. All in all, excellent hotel. Still under one year old and feels new. Great ambiance.

Despite mixed reviews on Trip Advisor, I succumbed to allure of staying at a brand new boutique hotel Montreal. However, I was really disappointed by the Hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s utter disregard for their hotel guests. I had several challenges (just thinking about this hotel makes me angry), but here are the major issues: NO Room Service I understand that it takes a while for any new hotel to run at full potential. However, I do not accept the complete disregard of customer service. I asked the Hotel restaurant if they were able to deliver my food order to my room (offered to pay extra), and if that was not possible, could they call me to pick up my order when ready. NO. If these options are not possible, the hotel should offer guests a free drink or appetizer while they wait to say \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsorry we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still going through some growing pains, but we appreciate your business, have a drink on us.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 NO Internet The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccomplimentary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 internet was so slow, consider it non-existent. Hotel management confirmed internet is an issue, and I must bear with it. So I asked where I could print my boarding pass, the answer was \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sorry we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a printer but you can print it at the airport. Well uh you have a printer behind the front desk, how about a little help since you lack a business centre and working internet? Taxi Stand Politcs Upon check out, I asked for a cab to the airport. The hotel porter took my luggage outside and strongly requested I wait inside. 20 min pass \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no cab - I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m now running late for my flight. I step outside and see a taxi stand right across the hotel! Upset, I grab my luggage and flag my own taxi. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the scoop: The hotel won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t flag local cabs unless the cab driver agrees pays a fee; and since the fee is so high, most cab drivers can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford it. Therefore the hotel has a relationship with a cab company that dispatches upon call. Thanks to Le St-Martin politics, I nearly missed my flight! Weed smokers Since the internet wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working, I thought I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d take the opportunity to lounge by the pool deck and catch up on some reading. Not happening. A bunch of guys were smoking weed out in the open . The stench was so bad had to immediated go inside. What type of secuiryt/property management is this? Really small pool I really loved the pictures of the outdoor pool on the website- looked very big and impressive. In reality it was the smallest hotel pool I've ever seen. So over $200 later, what did I get? a frustrating experience in a new hotel that obviously doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care about their guests. Will I stay here again? absolutely not.

However, we had a number of annoying experiences during our stay: - At check-in, they had cancelled our reservation and could not explain why except by saying that it was a mistake. Luckily, they were capable of back tracking and give us a room. - They greatly insisted that we take their parking service, as if there was no other choice. - The complimentary breakfast was ok. On the first morning, the service went well. On the second, it was absolut chaos with the maitre d speaking so loud you had the impression that we were at the New York stock exchange. It took about 40 minutes to be served with the croissants and the juice coming after the eggs. - The magnetic cards to access the elevators, the room, pool and fitness center were difficult to use which became very annoying. - We had to go to the front desk to get a towel for the pool. A 25$ deposit was required... and we were told to bring back the towel at the desk and could not leave it at the room. - At check out, they wanted to bill an additional $80 for a movie that we had not ordered (they recognized their mistake) and for $30 a night parking. At check in, we were told that the parking was $10 a night. The person at the desk said she could only make me a $14 a night rate... - Overall, the quality of the service is simply not up to par with a place that aspires to be a high end venue.

I highly doubt the room was that big, and I think the pics on the site make the rooms out to be nicer than expected. We paid a reduced rate with one night free, but I think this is all the room would be worth. I would not pay full price to stay there. Saying that though, I really liked the hotel for the price we paid. Our room was on the top floor in a corner and it was SILENT. We never heard a neighbor, never heard a maid cleaning, NOTHING. Our room was also very comfy, and we had one of the most comfy beds I have ever slept in at a hotel. I slept well all 5 nights we were there. The living room area was nice too for lounging, although I could not figure out the fireplace. The bathroom was super nice. There was a shower and a tub that was separate and gorgeous. We had two sinks (one of which was broke the first night we were there but fixed by the next day). We had three phones, wireless internet (which was actually kinda a slow connection, but worked for the most part). One thing that annoyed me is the maids kept cleaning and entering the room even with our do not disturb sign up. Three days they did this. One day, they tried to get in while we were naked and getting ready, which was super annoying. The front desk and concierge were super nice. Service was great (except the maid thing). The pool area was small, but very kewl on the rooftop. There was also nice outside seating area for drinks.

No business area as indicated on the website, it's only one computer (very slow internet). 1st room had no internet (lan or wireless).

Pool is noting but a lane, maybe 15 ft in length and 4 feet across? Basically you would not be able to swim, but nice to just lounge i guess. The work out room that over looks the pool (well u could see the edge of the pool if you press your face against the glass) was small and not very useful. Both the pool and fitness room over looks a ugly parking lot. I stayed 5 nights and 2 days received no housekeeping. My card de-magnetized 3 times I was there. Kept it in my pocket out of touch from credit cards and cell phones. I know it's a new hotel but with all this, there was no apolgies what so ever and no attempt to make things right. This is a very bad start to what could have been a good business hotel, but I will NOT return and will be taking my business elsewhere. Oh, and they only had 2 elevator which were extremely slow. Asked several time about a late checkout and each time was told I had to ask on the day I left. Normally it's 11am but was only able to get a 12pm checkout. Funny thing was the hotel was not fully booked. Had to keep my luggage @ reception. When I return to pick it up @ 5pm i check my old room. Of course housekeeping didn't even come as I left the \"please make up room\" sign stuck inbetween the door and it was still where I left it. The rooms were nice (since it just opened Jun 2010). You could nNOT connect your laptop to the TV as they disabled the controls for input. Fireplace was fake and did not generate any heat. Not a concern now but in the winter if you were expecting a gas fireplace you would be disappointed.
