We stayed for 5 nights. It was an all around great experience. The staff was all very friendly, the accomodations we excellent and the location can't be beat. With the hotel right on the North end of Duval Street where it meets the ocean almost anything in to see/do in Key west is a 10 minute walk away. The harbor is just to the east, Mallory Square to the west and most of Duval street is right there for you. My wife was 5 months pregnant so the short walks were VERY appreciated. They do offer free parking if you need to get anywhere far and have a car you neet to store while you are in town. We took everyone's advice and got a room facing the Gulf. Some of the rooms do border close to Duval/Front street which gets loud especially close to bar closing time so something facing the garden/pool in the center of the hotel or facing the harbor will be MUCH quieter. If you are someone who might still be in the bar at closing time it won't matter. We were there over college spring break time and some people on our floor started to get a little rowdy before heading out one night but hotel security shut that down around 11:00 and made sure they knew to take the party someplace else after getting back for the evening. I've been to some hotels where the staff is reluctant to get anyone upset so the quick action was appreciated. Other plusses: - Both my wife and I felt the breakfast at the cafe each morning was excellent. There was no need to go elsewhere unless you wanted something quick before heading to an activity for the day. - Housekeeping leaves a door hanger where you can mark when you will be out of the room so they know when to come in and clean up while you are gone. - The wine bar has live entertainment each evening which we found to be very good and wrapped up at the right time. Good for sitting out and relaxing at the end of the day. - The beach attendants to a nice job cleaning up the beach throughout the day so that it's always very orderly on their beach. No seaweed or empty glasses moving around. - Free towels and water at the beach and pool. Nice. Our only complaints: - While the breakfast was very delicious they need more waitstaff in the morning. Two waiters for around 20 tables in the morning just doesn't cut it. - The chairs for the beach and the pool are older and kind of uncomfortable. They could use an upgrade. Just a really nice well done experience from a hotel in a great location.", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland, OH", "Title": "\u201cA Sanctuary in the Heart of Key West\u201d", "Author": "DKLAG", "ReviewID": "UR126107187", "Content": "My wife and I, along with another couple just returned from Key West.

Having stayed at Ocean Key across the street before, we knew we liked the location at the end of Duvel Street, and thought we would try Pier House. We splurged on the dockside suite(room 807- first floor), as we really like just chilling on the deck, and watching the sunsets. The view was epic, you can see all the party boats cruise by at sunset, and watch all the action along the pier from your deck chair.The deck wrapped around 2 sides, with 2 loungers and 2 chairs and small table. Like another reviewer said, there is a large public area under these rooms, and there was a small crowd there for sunset. I would recommend getting a room on the second floor of the dockside building (6 rooms, 3 per floor) as it would be more private. The room itself was clean, very bright, if small. It was laid out in a way that the living room (with pull out) was in the front, with the bathroom between the living room and rear bedroom, in a sort of ' Jack and Jill' design. This room would work for 2 couples, or a family of 4. The property itself is quite lager, but laid out well, so it feels casual. There several buildings, connected by pathways and filled in with lush gardens a water features. The pool is small, but open 24 hours, and there is a small private beach. The beach is groomed every morning (seaweed cleaned up), there is towel and lounge chair service, and a raft anchored in the swimming area. The beach is sheltered from the bay, so would be ok for smaller kids (but no life guard). There are two bars on site; one very small, and full of locals, and another right by the beach. There is also a restaurant on site, that we ate at twice. The food was ok, nothing special. We were pleasant surprised with the Free Parking ( no valet service) and free, fast, Wi-FI. Overall, this is a great resort in a perfect location. If you are going to come all this way to Key West I would splurge on a dockside suite and bask in the best sunsets you will ever see.", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kevil Ky", "Title": "\u201cThe only place to stay in Key West\u201d", "Author": "Charles B", "ReviewID": "UR125845528", "Content": "Just back from 7 nights in Key West our annual trip for the last 6 years,we have always stayed at the Pier House the last few years in a Harbor View room you get what you pay for.

The room \"A Luxury King Spa Guest Room\" did not have a bath or a balcony as we'd been lead to believe it would. When I checked at the front desk about this was told very abruptly & rudely that we'd have to pay $100s more for this than we'd paid. We paid just under \u00c2\u00a32000 for 6 nights & thought this was not to be sneezed at as she suggested. She never did get back to us if a room with those items did become available. We then discovered that the toilet did not flush so had to ask for someone to repair it. In the middle of our first night there was loud shouting & running in the corridor, then the fire alarm went off 3 times. Everyone else on our floor were also up and asking what the problem was. I phoned down to reception to find out if this was a real alarm and was told curtly that this had been reported already and someone was dealing with it, I was then hung up on! The next morning we discovered that our hire car in the resorts private car park had a flat tyre. A coincidence? We had a view of part of the car park, complete with noisy drunks wandering through/past every night. Other complains are that on several occasions we had to ask to have our room serviced as it appeared to have been forgotten. Coffee for the machine in the room did not get replaced till we asked, also had to ask 3 times to have toilet tissue and shower caps replaced in the bathroom before getting any. We travel a lot and have never had such bad service & just general rudeness from front desk staff anywhere else. This was our 4th visit to Key West and have always had a warm welcome in other places we've stayed. This was also our 5th Wedding Anniversary holiday so extra disappointing for us to stay here.

Hot, loud, crowded. And that makes the crowd here all the more curious..lots of older couples in their khakis and hats looking a little surprised. Mixed in with young people carrying their drinks around in plastic cups and lost souls in scraggly beards asleep on benches. And there wasn't a cruise ship docked in town when we were there. I can't imagine how loud the town gets when that is a factor. But it is a town full of history and architecture that shouldn't be missed. I was torn between staying in a guesthouse in one of the old buildings around town and in staying in a resort on the water. I think we got the best of both worlds at the Pier House. The Pier House is the original resort in town and although it is clear it has been renovated it is still funkier than the chain properties on the ocean side of the town. The interior garden area is pretty, the little beach is nice (one side is topless, although I didn't see any topless bathing) and the beach bar and restaurant is very nice. The rooms in the Bayside and Dockside buildings have to be some one the nicest in town. The Lanai suites are cute facing the interior of the garden-not very private but space is at a premium in this little town and they laid them out well given what they have to work with. Sadly we had one of four rooms that overlooked the parking lot but when a water front room became available the next evening the staff moved us without complaint. The staff here is excellent-helpful, friendly. They absolutely are one of the reasons I gave this place such a high mark. It is right near Mallory Square but when you are in the resort you feel miles away. We did the whole Key West pub crawl thing (during which I'd advise that you NOT get one of the temporary tattoos-once they smudge they are not repairable and not even a bleach pen gets rid of them) and it was fun. But the drinks are strong and the crowd gets crazy at night. I imagine there are a thousand and one stories of mishaps and guilty mornings here. On our return trip (and there will be more than one) I would scour the historical points of interest, take a yoga class, have a treatment at The Pier House spa, go to the Gardens of Key West and see the aromatherapy lady there, have a few afternoon drinks at La Te Da, watch the sunset at the pier bar then settle in back at The Pier House before the night gets going for a remorse-free and tattoo-less Key West vacation.", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sanibel Island, Florida", "Title": "\u201cBeware of \"Traditional Rooms\" at the Pier House Resort\u201d", "Author": "Anne S", "ReviewID": "UR123748444", "Content": "My sister and I stayed one night at this resort and really enjoyed the hotel and it's location.

Yes, there were many people at the pool and on the beach, but it frankly didn't feel overly crowded. Be aware that Pier House is not a huge beach resort like one would find on a Caribbean island. It is a \"pocket\" beach resort integrated into Key West. We were impressed by the service at the resort. We had room service for breakfast a couple of times, and the food was good and prompt. The room was cleaned every day at the requested time. The concierge was very knowledgable about local activities and made parasailing reservations for us. We will always remember our time in the Beachcomber Suite.

We got off to a rocky start with them on a promised discount on room rates due to our wedding being over powerboat race weekend but it worked out for us. I would probably never spend that much on a hotel room again but under the circumstances I was happy I did it. The Dockside Suite was great - not huge but it featured a small living room which combined with the large balcony allowed us to entertain 10 - 15 guests at a time to watch the races etc. Excellent view of the powerboats which pass less than 100 feet from the balcony. We used the spa for a couples massage on an outdoor balcony upon arrival which I think will now be a must for return trips. I liked the Beach Bar, we had drinks a few times and had lunch their once. Food and room service is not overpriced as you may find at the chain resorts - we ordered in breakfast on our last day. Spent one afternoon at the beach which is about as good as you get in Key West (you don't go for the beach). Service for our wedding was excellent - everything was perfect, and the setting couldn't be beat. They held what was left of our wedding cake until the following night, then brought it to our room so we could enjoy it with some of our family the following night. Overall no hesitation to recommend for a wedding or vacation - we have reservations for a week next October.

Very conveniently located at the foot of the famous Duval Street and opposite notable Mallory Square. Gorgeous water views from the hotel's wraparound walkway that extends out over the water and also from the hotel's Harborview Cafe. The grounds are stunningly landscaped as tropical gardens surrounding the interior of the property, the swimming pool and a hot tub. Our well-appointed double-bed room opened onto a private, fenced in and landscaped patio that has several nice plantings. The beach is small but ample with plenty of room to swim in the Gulf of Mexico provided by a roped-off area. There are three bars: in the Beach Bar and Grille, the Wine Galley and a small Chart Room Bar that has around six seats and allows smoking. The open-air outdoor Beach Bar and Grill is nicely appointed with rustic wooden chairs and tables and an overhead to protect diners from the sun. We cannot review the food because we chose to eat elsewhere. There is a piano bar in the Wine Gallery with an entertainer Friday through Monday. Unfortunately, we missed the performer because we were there in the middle of the week. There is also a conference center, a Caribbean Spa and an Internet area that is just off the well appointed lobby. The resort also offers waterfront suites. Parking is complimentary and there is no resort fee. The Pier House is conveniently located to many of the staple attractions on Duval Street, a stone's throw from Mallory Square, and the Conch Tour Train stop is next door.

So we got in our Gallant and drove out to Front St (which if you stay on the harbor side is the only apparent way to get out) which was flooded but only looked to be a few inches covered... as soon as we got out onto Front St. water went over our car and we barely made it to the Conch Tour Train Station. When we called the front desk back for help they made is seem like we were stupid and it should have been obvious that we should not have left. Well seeing as how we are guests at your hotel and spending roughly $400/night on a room taking that kind of attitude should not be the first thing out of your mouth. The only person at the hotel that helped the situation was Bill he apologized for the staff and promised to correct their behavior... he also helped us out with a room that night seeing as how we were stuck on the island another day. However I would never go back to Pier House nor would I recommend it to friends or family!!", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cOverall, very nice...\u201d", "Author": "SumBeach_1", "ReviewID": "UR119534802", "Content": "Have been to Key West annually for about the last decade.

The resturaunts in the resort were very good, and we particularly enjoyed the Chart room. A few issues though the firsat was minor - the WIFI did not work during our whole stay. Not a big deal since this kept me out of touch with work which was probably a good thing. The second was major and will keep me from going back. On the sixth day of our stay I was awakened by a loud groaning, moaning series of noises from outside our patio doors at 5:30 am. When I looked outside I was amazed to see an overweight, middle aged couple having sex outside our room on the beach. I turned on the patio light, they didn't care. Opened and slammed the patio door, they didn't care. Amazingly this did not wake my girlfriend up, but I know from past experience that if I had used the phone - I would have woken her.

Growing up in the Midwest, being by the ocean is still a luxury for us and that was a major factor in selection of a hotel. Our most important criteria was a room with a balcony that would provide a beautiful view of the water. We also wanted to be in walking distance of the older part of Duval Street. The Dockside Suite we stayed in gave us all that. There was so much to enjoy in Key West but we hurried back to be on our balcony at sunset. The view was spectacular! Many of the hotel's rooms wouldn't have the view ours did and wouldn't provide the feeling of being on your own island. Our balcony was so clear, there didn't seem to be a barrier between us and the water. We were surprised to discover the Dockside Suites were not ground level. From the photographs on the website, it looked like we could go out on our deck and dangle our feet in the water. Instead, there is a restaurant and a gathering area on the first level. I'm very glad I read reviews here and talked with the hotel before booking the room or I'd have been disappointed. Going into the suite, the first room is the bedroom and it is a little small. It did have room for everything necessary and my sister said the bed was wonderful. The linens looked new and the whole suite was very clean. There was a TV and coffee maker across from the bed and several shelves close to the TV. There was a tiny refrigerator (about the size of a microwave) on one of the shelves. The room didn't have a microwave, which surprised me. The lights were brighter than a lot of hotel lights, which was a big plus. The bedroom doesn't have a view.at all. Just past the bedroom was the bathroom on the left and a large closet on the right that contained a safe. The bathroom was a little roomy and there was a small TV mounted on the wall. I would have appreciated the TV more if the bathroom had had a tub. It had a roomy shower with an area to sit. The water felt like there was a little too much water softener or something oily in it and the shower head wasn't really adjustable to make the spray harder. Because of that, it was hard to get soap rinsed off and not feel there was a film left on the skin and hair. The last room was the living area, with a sofa bed and several chairs, a TV and floor to ceiling windows making up half the wall on the end. Pulling back the curtains, we could see a gorgeous view of the water and the endless balcony the website talked about. I slept on the sofa bed and it was very uncomfortable. The mattress was thin and I could feel the metal bars. The balcony had a set of plastic mesh loungers and chairs with little tables similar to those you'd have by a pool. They were very comfortable and the mesh fabric was a help in the high temperatures. We had a wonderful view of both sunsets and sunrises from the balcony and loved hearing and watching the boats go by. The hotel has a small swimming area with sand to the right of our room but being on the top floor kept our room quiet. At night, the harbor lights for the other hotels and the piers were beautiful. We only ate at the hotel restaurant once and were disappointed. The service was slow, even though we were the only customers inside and there were few customers outside. Part of my order was missing, so I had to wait longer for that to be corrected. We finally decidedto take the rest upstairs. When we got upstairs, I found my main course was inedible. The manager did take that portion of the meal off our tab, but that was it. The hotel staff was very friendly and the requests we made for room location were honored with no problem. When checking out the bill was accurate, including the adjustment for my dinner. The hotel is located at the end of Duval Street, and the Key West Trolley is just a short walk away. The trolley is a good way to see Key West, as you can get on and off as much as you like. The drivers were very entertaining and full of info about Key West history. When we got trolley tickets, it was buy a day pass, get another day pass free. If the Key West Shuttle schedule fits yours and your plans don't require you to have a car, you might want to consider taking it if you're flying into Fort Lauderdale or Miami. Their service was great, with not many pick ups or drop offs between the airport and the city of Key West. Both drivers stopped about halfway to give people a short break and refuel. We were able to pick up some necessities, too, so that was helpful. We had a wonderful time and know we'll go back to Key West. We aren't certain we'll go back to Pier House, as room service breakfast and a comfortable second bed are more important to us than we realized. Having a tub is good, too, and that wasn't something we thought to ask about. I'm attaching photos of the suite, the balcony and the view. ( I will attach some of tthem now and some later after the review is accepted) It won't let me attach many to this review at once.

We checked on their site ahead of time and didn't see any restrictions for the pool, or their beach. No where do they post signs that show no outside coolers, or beverages. So of course we rolled in a cooler to the place with plenty of our own beverages. We were not bothered the first day and we ran up a 400.00 bar tab along with out own alcohol we had. Day 2 the security guy comes up with a massive attitude and told us that we had to move the cooler or leave the pool area. Now I am not upset about the part of taking the cooler out of the pool area...I understand that they need to make money to stay afloat but there is a nice way and a totally wrong way to deal with the situation. We told the security person that everyone there had coolers and we didn't know the hotel had a rule against them...so we moved the cooler away to the parking area and left it next to or car ( this was in sight of our pool chairs.) just out of spite we kept going to our cooler to grab beers filling up our plastic cups and walking back to the pool. the security guard went and took the cooler and locked it in his office. ( we witnessed him taking it) so we went to the front desk asked if they would return our 50.00 rolling cooler that security took. They called the security guard on duty he claimed he had no clue....this is not how you take care of people that are spending over 4500.00 a night in rooms and over 400.00 a day in a bar tab... To shorten he story as soon as this moron left for the day they found our cooler in his office and returned it to us. We purposely did not eat at the hotel after that ( 20 people each day for breakfast and no lunch at the pool) We did drink there at the pool but we did everything we could from that point on not to spend money there....loved the Hotel but the jest of this complaint is in the future they need to explain that customer service is an important part of customer satisfaction even by the security guy. We were rowdy having a great time...and were asked about the cooler 2 nights later at the beach by a much smarter guy....We were all drinking on the beach, swimming and having a good time. The night security guy walked up and asked us to please remove the cooler from the beach because of safety reasons. We could take it back to our room, store it in the hallway and he even asked if he could get us some plastic cups from behind the bar...

We were easily able to do this since the hotel is nicely tucked away from Duval, but close to everything it has to offer. We were able to take advantage of the amenities at the hotel itself before venturing out to see the rest of what Key West had to offer by spending time sitting out on our balcony, heading to the private beach, beach bar and grill, and spending nights at the pool. I love that the beach and pool are open 24/7 and provide drink service--Excellent pina coladas! The concierge was very helpful in finding us a wind and wine sunset sail and a snorkel trip to fit our needs and price goals. The hotel as a whole was VERY accomodating in providing the extra room ammenities that our friends and family purchased off the honeymoon we created with the help of the concierge via e-mail prior to the wedding. We asked them to spread out the delivery of some of these ammenities, and they did a fantastic job keeping us excted about what would be waiting for us in our room upon our return.

We both had been to Key West many times but never stayed in a hotel, only condos. This time, we decided to finally stay at the end of Duval Street and just enjoy ourselves. All I can say is next time we come to Key West , we WILL be staying once again at The Pier House!! Located right in the center of all the things to do, yet once on the grounds, everything seems so far away and it's peaceful and quiet. We stayed in a Traditional King room and it was very large and plenty of room. Nicely decorated and a large balcony as well. I had read a few \"bad\" reviews about the hotel but all I can say to those people is... WTF are you talking about? Rooms were very clean, entire grounds were manicured and beach/pool was well maintained. The cleaning staff deserves MUCH credit as our room was taken care of every day and we both were surprised with a turndown service each night. Chocolate hits the spot when you are coming in late from Duval Street. :) We were close to the marina (only a 10 minute walk) for our boat excursions and Mallory Square was also 5 minutes away. CVS is right across the street for anything you forgot or need. We got this thing called \"The Key West Bar Card\" - well worth the $20.00 and a lot of the bars that gave the 2 for 1 discounts were all within 2 blocks of the resort, two right across the street. There are even two bars at The Pier House that allow you use of the card as well. This even counts for the pool/beach waitress, as every day she was always there checking up on us in a timely manner and we got 4 drinks for the price of two with the cards. We also went to a lot of bars I'd never even thought of going to (until I bought the bar card) and we discovered some new hang outs just off Duval. Great time at all the bars. I can't express in words what a wonderful time we both had for our anniversary and The Pier House made it special for us.

One day we said we didn't need service, but the housekeeper made sure we had clean towels and told use if we changed our mind, just to let her know. The pool and beach area is small, but it really is all you need. My husband and I like the feel of a smaller hotel rather then a large resort. The bartender at the beach bar was very friendly as so was the waitresses on the beach. The food at the beach bar, in my opinion, is the best around for bar type food. The blacked Mai sandwich and Conch firtters are really good!! The drink menu is a little boring, but not a big deal, they have a full bar and can make anything. One of the days we were there, the power went out on the island, and it seemed like everyone at the hotel was either at the pool or beach, and the beach bar staff worked very hard and fast to make sure everyone was getting drinks. The hotel has a full spa, which I have been to every time I come, and have always enjoyed my services. But without a doubt, you simply can not beat the location of this hotel.

I couldn't understanding why the hotel didn't cool down the temperature of the water by adding cold water. The air temperature was 96 degrees and I'm sure the pool temperature was almost the same.

Megan the tour guide is amazing and this is hands down the most fun activity we have done in Key West. On to places to eat: Breakfast - Pepe's & Blue Heaven, Lunch - BO's Fish Wagon, Cocktails - Rum Bar @ The Speakeasy & of course the Chart Room, Dinner - Kelly's & Louie's Backyard (Lee or Todd can get a reservation for this one), and Desert - Better Than Sex is a desert bar and if you have a sweet tooth and miss this your crazy!

I wanted every possible amenity for a fairly short stay and they had it. As it got close, I noticed they were running specials that we qualified for. I had already put down a deposit, but they changed my reservation to a package that included breakfast and massages plus a little bit of a break on the rate. They didn't have to do that, but they did and I am eternally grateful. Our harborview room was great... not huge but spacious enough for 2. Our second floor balcony had a nice view with lots going on, but don't expect expansive panoramic views. I suppose we could have gotten a dockside suite for that or asked for a higher floor perhaps. Bed was comfy, sheets of reasonable quality and a decent flat screen for watching in-room movies. Bathroom was nice w/a spacious shower. Water pressure wasn't great, but certainly good enough. We had breakfast on the house every morning at the Harborview Cafe. The food here was excellent. Hotel dining is expensive. It could have easily run us $40 or $50/day just for breakfast so I was very pleased to have this included in our package. Besides the food, the view was also great. This routine was a truly outstanding part of our stay. The grounds were lush and beautifully landscaped. The small private beach was well-kept, as was the pool, though we didn't take advantage of either. The spa was professional and clean, staffed with wonderful people... no teeny boppers fresh out of massage school. I wish I had the time for a full spa day! Finally, there's the location, which cannot be beat. You're right at the end of Duval Street, next to Mallory Square and close to all the shops.

I have to say, before departing I read some reviews with negative comments, and after returning, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand how anyone could have a negative review of this hotel. I arrived around 6 pm on Monday and check-in was smooth and pleasant. I had booked my flights and hotel through Expedia.com and there was only one choice of room type available (basic). When I checked in I asked if I could get the best room in that price range and they gave me a nice room overlooking the center courtyard/garden with a king bed. It had easy access to the front desk, pool, restaurants, and the beach. They even had a security guard tote my bags up to the room for me. The piano bar was closed for remodeling, but everything else was in working order. The lush tropical vegetation made for a beautiful view from my balcony as well as while walking down the pathways. The air conditioning thermostat was easy to access to adjust the temperature as needed. The walk-in shower was lovely with the huge shower head suspended from the ceiling and it had a small seat. There were wonderful clean fluffy white towels in abundance. The room even had a large flat screen TV and a small refrigerator. And yes, there is a CVS Pharmacy across the street, very handy! The resort location is perfect. One block to Mallory Square, 1 \u00c2\u00bd blocks the other way to the Harbor/Wharf boardwalk, and easy access to the western end of Duval Street. There is also a boat tour operator right outside the property for glass bottom boat tours, sunset cruises and snorkeling trips. The only slightly negative comment I have is that the pool water temperature was HOT, not refreshing at all. I ate at the Harborview Caf\u00c3\u00a9 several times for breakfast and had snacks brought to me at the pool. Service was good, the food was great, and the view fantastic! The beach is smallish, but beaches in Key West are rare. They bring in sand from the Bahamas. The size of the beach was fine for the amount of people using it. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spend any time in the cigar bar (air-conditioned and enclosed), it was too smoky for me, but it seemed nice.

There had been previous reviews that commented on the noise heard outside their room. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear much while the air-conditioning fan was on, but I did hear an occasional door open or close. All in all, everything was clean, comfortable, and hospitable. I just can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see why the listed room prices are $600.00 per night. The Expedia price I paid was much more like I would expect.

We were immediately disappointed by the only somewhat helpful front desk staff. Although she was pleasant enough, she stated that we didn't have a choice of rooms as they were fully booked and just assigned us one even though we arrived before the designated check in time. Normally the earlier you arrive, the better choice of rooms you have. The bellman promptly escorted us to our assigned room which turned out to be a handicapped room. Our first thought was, why assign us this room when neither of us are handicapped? Wouldn't you want to keep this room vacant for a handicapped person? Aside from having special design features to assist the handicapped, the TV was not even placed in direct view of the bed, but was inconveniently place somewhat away from the bed and from the sitting area. We questioned the bellman about whether other rooms had the same set up and he said he really didn't know. Not very helpful. Additionally, although he was friendly enough, he was only able to marginally converse in English which just frustrated us that much more. When we called the front desk and told them they assigned us a handicapped room, the clerk seemed surprised and kept us on held for what seemed like an eternity and reassigned us to another room on the second floor. On the plus side, the new room had a far better layout, was clean, comfortable, and we were happy to have it. In the morning I looked at the coupon for the breakfast and it said that we could eat at the Harbourview Restaurant or in room. We decided to eat at the restaurant and were very pleasantly surprised. The food was very good and the portion sizes were ample. As an aside, the waiters we had for both days were foreign as well; they were very nice but were a little difficult to understand. It was great that the hotel had a little beach and a pool nearby as well. Although the beach is very small, it was still nice to have one on premises. I don't believe any of the other hotels in Old Town have one. The pool on the other hand was large enough but it was so hot we couldn't even stay in it so after the first day, we didn't even try it again. It felt like a hot tub; the water at the little beach was far more refreshing. So overall, we found the staff somewhat indifferent and in higher end hotels you expect a little more.

Great decision, this place is absolutely wonderfull. The staff are wonderful, helpful and very courteous. The beach is very nice although very small. I realize now that there are really not any nice or well taken care of beaches in Key West. I was satisfied with the beach at Pier House, more so after walking around the neighboring resorts and their \"beaches\". The resort is quiet and upscale, but once you go out the entry you are immediately on Duvall and everything there is within easy walking distance.

The beach area was gorgeous and swimming in the gulf was fantastic! My lanai room was nicely appointed and very close to the pool /beach. Food and drink are slightly high, but no moreso than other nice properties in the area. The negatives were: in spite of what they say, there is NO internet service in the rooms. The beach bar had access but once you went back to the room, it was gone. I asked many of the guests and we all experienced the same thing. The topless beach area is a nice amenity but it's surrounded by bushes (I'm guessing they were required to do this) which totally ruins the gulf view. The only other problem I had was my refirgerator was turned all the way down and there was no obvious way to adjust it. I called maintenance and they pulled the unti from the cabinet and turned it up - the control was in the back. Not a huge issue, just an annoyance.

I looked online and saw rates of $199 and $224 for our two weekend nights. Since this was MUCH less than Ocean Key I decided to investigate. I called the hotel with lots of questions and ended up booking a traditional king. I requested a balcony room on the 2nd floor. I was told that they were running a special and the rates were not normal rates (which I knew). When we arrived we were told we were upgraded to a 2nd floor balcony with a courtyard view (as opposed to a parking lot or wall view). Room: The room was great. Perfect for two. Clean, modern, island theme (nice green colors with tropical art) and the balcony was very, very private. It was so lushly landscaped that no one could see in and we could really not see much but the gardens/plants. The bathroom had a large enough walk in rain shower. A/C was touch screen and easy to operate. Housekeeping: Great. The entire hotel and grounds were immaculate. Staff: Non remarkable. Not great, but not bad either. Efficient. Pool/Beach area: Did not go to pool - but it looked clean and simple. Nothing fabulous. However, the small beach area was very nice. The sand was nice, chairs and towels at your service with a smile, the water is deep (not good for kids) and good for snorkeling near the rocks - we saw many tropical fish and crabs. The waves are quite big as the large boats go by. Again, NOT good for kids. We did not see any kids at hotel or on beach. We enjoyed the beach area alot. The hotel is very lushly landscaped with beautiful tropical flowers and a koi pond. Location: Superb. This is the best location in Key West. You don't want to stay at the other end of Duval. Pier House is in the best location - true walking distance to most. Dining: Good food and drinks but pricey. Worst part was our waiter. He was just not with it and seemed miserable. We also waited too long for our food. We didn't get a side item was asked for but when bill came we were charged for it. Waiter did not apologize just corrected the bill. The two major cons of our experience was the fact that sunlight blasted into our room at 6:30 Am from 'grates' in the ceiling above our bed. We couldn't do anything but put blankets over our heads to avoid the sunlight. AND, the balcony was unusable due to the fact that the AC blew hot air out and made the balcony well over 100 degrees. We could really only manage a few minutes on the balcony at a time due to the heat. Overall, we had a good experience at Pier House and would stay again for the same price. I would not pay over $300 to stay in the same room type. TIPS: Request balcony when booking traditional king room. Don't bring your kids here. Make sure your room has no chance of letting morning sun in!", "Date": "June 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cFabulous locations but Pier House is only OKAY!\u201d", "Author": "Sunryz710", "ReviewID": "UR31992469", "Content": "We stayed at the Pier House from May 23rd to May 27th. Pier house is in a fabulous location right on the water and Duvall street and overall clean. It is the small things that make a difference in a property where you just are WOWED and want to go back. The Pier House unfortunately is not very service oriented. Also, did not have amenities that it promised on its website. If you are not well traveled then stay here, you will find it a fine place to stay but go elsewhere if you are used to fine properties. Here are the things that we were disappointed with: 1. Upon check in, there was no orientation of the hotel. It was our first visit and there are 5 buildings. The front desk worker just handed me the key and said you are in room 288. I had to ask her what building it was located in and how to get there. She was puzzled and searched for a property map and first gave me wrong information. She then corrected herself and explained my room was upstairs in the main building. There was no explanation of where the pool was or where the restaurants/bars are located or anything, not even directions to the elevator. This is not the end of the world, but good hotels, give you an orientation when you are checking in. We eventually found the elevator which was un-airconditioned and smelly. We were both worried the room would be the same\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but once we found our way to the room our worries subsided. The room was nicely appointed and very clean. The only bad point to the room was the height of the sink in the bathroom. I am 5 ft tall and found it difficult to comfortably use the sink. It was really high.. I wonder how children brush their teeth and wash their hands in the sinks at this property. To give you a visual, I had to be on my tip toes and my chest was even with the surface and try to trajectory spit the toothpaste into the center of the sink\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 lol.. It was all good. Okay so Pier House advertises on their website that they offer wireless internet access as an amenity in their rooms. This was one of the reasons we booked the property. Unfortunately room 288 doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have internet access. Within 30 minutes of checking in, I called downstairs to see why I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t able to connect. I was told that I would have to go to the beach bar or beach to get access. This was a BIG deal to us because , I had to do some work while in town and it was very inconvenient. They didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offer to switch rooms or anything. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think this was acceptable since it was advertised on their website that there is wireless internet access as an amenity in the rooms. They should list it as some rooms have wireless internet connection not as a general statement referring to all of their rooms. 3rd gripe with the Pier House is that we set a wake up call for Monday morning. The front desk told me I was all set, but we never got the wake up call. Again, not acceptable for a quality hotel. Last but not least the safe in teh room was broken and not working. I know these are little things, but when you add them up, the little things are important. Overall we had a great time in Key West. I do not think we would ever chance the Pier House again especially since there is a Westin, Hyatt and Ocean Key all in equivalent locations. This property may be okay for you.. but we like more upscale properties with excellent service. By the way, I did express our disappointment when we checked out at the front desk.

We stayed at a Caribbean Spa room. It was spacious and newly renovated with flat-screen TV (one in the bathroom too), refrigerator, king size bed, wi-fi, plank floor and tasteful furnishings. We could hear a rooster crowing each day. Outside the French doors is a stone terrace with table and comfortable chairs, perfect for morning coffee, screened by tropical bushes and trees. Just enough morning sun filters through the vegetation. The babble of spilling water from the hot tub at the spa drowns out the minimal street noise. As with most things new and untried, there are some features that could be improved. The closet needs a light. The shower is modern and well-designed, but splashed water collects on the door sill and spills out under the half-inch gap below the shower door. Exit the shower and you step into a substantial puddle on the bathroom floor. (I notified the desk when I checked out. Meanwhile, I placed a towel on the floor before showering to soak up the spill.)

We had booked a standard room through Orbitz and so we were expecting the lower level with a less than desirable view. I asked the desk clerk if she could 'hook us up' with the best room for our rate and we were blown away by the accomodations and view of the gulf.

Dinner at Sarabeth's was very good (Sunday night fried chicken), dinner at Duffy's was good (we intended to eat at Seven Fish but did not realize you needed a reservation - ALWAYS call ahead for reservations at the nicer restaurants), and we splurged and enjoyed our final night's dinner at Lattitude's on Sunset Key (pricey, but well worth it because of the trip over to the island and the beautiful setting).

Was in Key West for 4 days but decided to stay here the first two as with many hotels, their prices went up on the weekend while the other hotel we chose to stay at on the Island (Casa Marina Resort - see another review) their weekend prices were much lower then weekday rates. When you first arrive, it almost seems like a motel like many of the western hotels. The parking is FREE which is a huge plus. The location is absolutely perfect for all the night life as it is literally at the very top of Duval Street, next to Mallory Square. The hotel has a very small beach (think the size of a postage stamp) that would be great for kids and kids alone. The pool look nice but we didn't utilize it. As other reviewers have said, when you first get there, it can be tricky to find your room as it is kind of a maze but once you get used to the layout, everything is very quick and easy. Take some time to actually walk around this resort as it is bigger then it looks and pretty to look at. The piers go out into the Gulf with a view of Sunset Key Island. If you tell the front desk you have a special occasion a head of time, they might just give you a free bottle of champagne (they did that to us). However, unless you have an ocean view (which I high recommend), your view will not be that great and you will feel like you are paying too much. I can't comment on the spa but it appeared that it probably would be pretty nice. Other then our view, the only other complaints that we really had was on the morning before we were set to leave, the first alarm started to malfunction and this went on for hours waking us up several times. No apologies given. Also, I understand that they \"technically\" have a beach, but they really shouldn't be advertising this due to its size and the view you get from it. The lobby could be nicer but who really stays in the lobby anyways. Be prepared, no elevators in the main building. Also, room service was very limited if any at all and the beach side bar never was open in the evening that we could see. The other bar was but only had a couple people in there so if you like to mingle, this isn't the best place to do it. Other then that, the hotel room was nice. Old but very modern at the same time and a decent size (not cramped). We had a balcony but it overlooked the hotel next door/parking lot and had a palm tree covering most of it (had to wade thru the leaves). The bathroom was very modern and nice. The staff seemed nice as well.

The resort is located at the end of Duval Street so it is right in the middle of Key West night life. I drove to Key West. There was plenty of parking at the resort and 24 hour security at the front gate. The staff was pleasant and helpful in providing me information about attractions. I ate breakfast once at the resort's restaurant and it was good... typical resort breakfast, typical prices. My room was clean and nicely decorated. It appeared recently renovated, and included a flat screen TV (cable TV w/HBO), very nice shower, big bed, refrigerator. A/C worked great and kept the room cool. There is an in-room safe which can accommodate a full size laptop, camera and other items easily. I couldn't get the internet to work, though I suspect staff would have helped me if I had asked. I used my AT&T wireless card instead. My room was a \"garden\" view room though it really looked out over the front courtyard (you could see some \"garden\" but it was mostly courtyard). Noise from the outside was not a problem, even though the opposing hotel's nightspot on the pier was close enough that I could hear the party from my deck. With the sliding door closed, I couldn't hear a thing. Noise between room walls was also not a problem. The noise from the room's door was a bit of a problem. The renovations to Pier House did not include sound proofing in the hallways and for whatever reason, sound really made it through the door to my room. I was only really bothered by this on Saturday night when several guest came back late and were a little loud, and on Sunday morning, when a guest dragged his or her rolling suitcase down the stairs at 6 AM. I think some sound proofing around the room doors would fix this and perhaps some sound proofing on the hallway floor and walls. That was really my only complaint with the whole stay. The hallways were a little \"mazey\" and it took me two days to figure out how to get from my room out the front of the resort without getting lost. Also, there wasn't an elevator that I could see, though staff has to be able to get cleaning carts up to the second/third floors, so there must be something. There are several very attractive \"rain forest\" walkways through the resort. The resort's private beach is small, but nice, with a pontoon to lay out on. From what I observed, boat wake may be a problem. I watched a boat race by the morning I had breakfast and it really generated some waves. Overall I enjoyed my stay. If you like being in the middle of everything, this is a great place to stay. There is a CVS open until midnight across the street. The majority of Key West night life is 1-5 blocks away as well as Mallory Square. If you are not interested in being in the \"thick of things\", you are better off staying a few blocks off of Duval Street or at the south end of Duval Street.", "Date": "December 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chambersburg PA", "Title": "\u201cHighly recommended\u201d", "Author": "grouptraveler8", "ReviewID": "UR22269443", "Content": "We stayed here with 3 other couples for three nights, our first time in Key West.

We had lunch in their beach front restaurant which served very nice food. We could not have enjoyed our stay more. We could walk to all the places we wanted to visit but there were reasonably priced taxis available when we wanted to go a little further away.

Since we do not spend a lot of time in the room, we could not see a reason to spend all that money. The bar is very pleasant, and pours a good drink. There is a small private beach, nice pool, grounds are well kept. We did not eat here on the advice of some locals we ran into at the bar, who said they were happy to drink here, but would never eat here. We made Pepe's on Caroline our breakfast spot, with great omlettes and wonderful atmosphere. Bed could be newer, matteress is a bit lumpy, but the room is just fine overall.

We always get the same room, a two bedroom suite which rents for $1300-$1600 a night. Obviously, we like this hotel: the location, the garden and beach, the peacefulness, and the view from the balcony. Unfortunately, we like this place almost in spite of itself. The quality has been inconsistent over the years, but we adjust to the laid-back Key West style. Our latest visit, however, was very disappointing. When we booked our trip 3 months' ago, we were told that new construction next to our suite would be finished except for minor interior trim work. When we arrived, we found an active construction site surrounding our room. The circular saw station next to our balcony was non-stop noisy, sawdust covered all the balcony furniture and blew around in the breeze. Deconstruction and nailing were incessant. Sometimes the workmen had to inch along our balcony rail to avoid falling off the torn up deck. The workmen were very nice and apologetic for the mess; I don't blame them for doing what they had to do. Hotel management was less concerned, however. If construction was in such a state, couldn't they have called and told us before we arrived? We are going again in 6 weeks for a vacation with our grown daughters. Questioning two managers, the front desk personnel, and guest relations manager about the construction status in 6 weeks only got a \"call us before you come\" response. Okay. One more time. The next time might be the last.

We arrived early and were greeted by smiling faces . I had requested an early check-in and I was not disappointed.We were allowed to check in by 11 a.m because the room had just been vacated.The front desk, in fact all of the employees that we had contact with were very helpful and friendly. We loved our Spa Room (623) on the second floor and across the street from the Rum Barrell. If you do not like a good band playing outside your window do not stay on this side of the Pier House,get a garden view or a harbor view,that is probably the quiet side. I had the French doors open and listened to the music until I could no longer stay awake. I walked across the smooth bamboo floors,closed the doors and fell into a very comfortable bed with crisp linen's and slept like a baby while the band played on. Some people have written the the jacuzzi tub is difficult to get into,well it is deep and you cannot step into it but if you sit on the edge,lift your leg's and turn yourself into the tub it shouldn't be a problem for anyone who does not have a severe handicap. The jacuzzi tub was just what we needed at the end of the day . The a/c was cool and efficient and a might be a little loud for some people, I know,how can you hear the a/c with the band and street sounds? Well with the French door's closed the street sounds are not that bad. A little more about the room....the bed had plenty of pillows. I always like some extra towels so I asked the housekeeping girls and was given towels without a hitch. The room was very clean and bare feet on that bamboo floor felt great. We had a great time and it was just what we were looking for with walking distance to most places. It was expensive ( 349+a night) and that was discounted I was told. I believe they wanted 379+ a night. We would definitely stay there again,of course it would be nice if it were a little less expensive .

The room was very close to all the offerings of the hotel. There were some sweet ants in the bathroom and on bedside table. We also found a worm in the bed one night. I did not complain because it is the tropics and we were on the ground floor, but the ants did kind of turn me off because we were paying over $400 a night. The pool was nice and refreshing. You can order food poolside and beachside from the pool bar and grill. The beach was nice however I didn't swim in the ocean or lay on the beach. Key West is not known for great beaches. We ate our New Year's Eve dinner at the Harborview Cafe and It was delicious. We had stone crab, salads and filets. The chef came around to every table to make sure the dinners were cooked well. The wine bar is nice too. They have music every night. Another bar at the hotel is called the Chart Room. It is a famous bar in the Keys. They have popcorn and happy hour which is fun. The showers were nice and tub was very deep which is good for soaking your feet after a long day of walking. We also ordered room service and it was delicious too.

It was our first trip to Key West. The hotel staff was warm and courteous when we arrived and our room was even ready! It was about 12:30 pm. The room was clean and pretty and we had a lovely view of the pool and beach area. My husband loved being able to use the gym in the morning. I went to the spa and indulged in several wonderful massages. The people at the spa were very welcoming and made me feel great each day that I went. All of the massage experts were great but I really loved Mimi because she had a very calming spirit about her and she was incredibly warm. She gave me the hot stone massage and the coma massage. I and my husband also enjoyed a massage by Michael who was also very good. The last day Michelle gave me a deep tissue that was the deepest I ever felt. My shoulders ached from it but it was a good ache. The Spa was my favorite part of the resort. The pool was clean every time we went swimming and there were waitresses taking drink orders by the pool. The bartenders were all women which I really liked because I felt comfortable going there and ordering a drink if I wanted one. The concierge was nice and helpful in planning for my husband to have a fishing trip one of the days. He loved it and said it was perfect. I only ate once at the hotel, it was lunch at the beach. I had a papaya shrimp salad. It was very nice but there are so many delicious restaurants in Key West that I had to try them. The location of the hotel is better than fabulous. We rented a moped to get around and it was great fun. But if you do not you can walk to many places. Alonzo's restaurant down the street has a great happy hour between 4-6. It's half price drinks and the left side of the menu which has lots of raw bar selections and the best white clam chili and onion rings. We went every single day. They also make the tastiest Mojitos. On our last day the hotel gave us an extra hour to check out because our flight did not leave until 4:00pm. All in all it was a very restful and fun trip with lots of therapeutic help from the spa. It was a perfect trip. BTW... The housekeeping staff was great too!

We also had a nice patio area with chairs which was tucked away and was a sun trap. The private hotel beach was excellent and although small wasn't busy while we were there and was nicer than the main public beach on the south of the island. It beat lying around a pool aswell. The bar/restaurant by the beach was good and the staff were attentive in taking drinks orders and providing beach loungers, tables and chairs. Although we didn't use the pool it looked good and had plenty of loungers around it aswell The location was excellent; right at the end of Duval street and at the lively end of the street at that. There are loads of restaurants and bars around the hotel. Also, Mallory park was only five mintues away where they have sunset festivals with street performers and drinks while watching the sun go down. This was well worth experiencing and wouldn't have known if someone hadn't mentioned it very close to the end of the holiday. The hotel reception were helpful from booking trips/laundry and also questions about Key West generally. This was a really nice friendly hotel and really made our holiday after checking out of the original hotel (Which is actually higher than the Pier house in the tripadvisor rankings).

After a horrendous vacation in the Dominican Republic, we booked this trip as a do-over so we could forget about that awful mistake. We were very pleased with the Pier House and hope to return again. BOOKING: The package we wanted was only available by booking with Pier House directly and it was an easy process. A few days after I made the reservation, I decided to upgrade to a spa room and it was not a problem. The Gourmet Getaway package is for four nights ($440 per night, plus $50 to upgrade to spa room), breakfast is included every morning along with two dinners at One Duval, their main restaurant. We also received about 15 drink coupons that were good for the various bars at the resort. CHECK IN: Very convenient and quick. We were in our room in about 5 minutes. There is ample parking and we were able to find a spot within a few feet of the spa building. ROOMS: If booking a spa room, ask for a ground floor room that faces the garden path in the back. These rooms have little French doors that open up on to small patios and you will be very close to the spa hot tub. We loved our room...we were just a few steps from the hot tub and were the only guests using it at night. Pier House staffers use the garden path, so they will stroll by every now and then. We weren't bothered by it. The spa rooms are very spacious and nicely decorated, but are starting to show their age. There were some small chunks missing from the Pergo floors (looked like someone had tried to move furniture on their own), the bathtub was chipped, and one of our sinks was cracked, but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leak. Overall, these are minor complaints and they did not interfere with our ability to enjoy the room. But, for nearly $500 per night, I can see how this would bother some people. Our room had a flat screen TV and a stereo system, so bring some CDs with you. You will need them because one of the bars near Pier House has this awful singer who goes until 11pm most nights. I thought about going over and giving this guy a giant tip so he would stop singing. Two cats fighting would sound better than this guy. I would suggest renting a mini fridge\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only $10 for the entire stay. You can stock it up with stuff from CVS across the street and one of the nearby liquor stores. SERVICE: We found the staff at Pier House friendly and helpful. All requests were honored quickly and without any hassle. Todd, the concierge, assisted us with bike rentals and arranged for us to take a sunset cruise on the Appledore, which we enjoyed. He was much more helpful than concierges I've encountered elsewhere. FOOD: Meals at Pier House can be expensive, so the package deal more than paid for itself. Breakfast would run about $30 - $40 and dinner would be around $120 -$130. Some of our favorite dishes were the crab cakes benedict, the omelets, the lobster pasta, the filet mignon, and the stuffed lobster. We thought the food was good. The menu is relatively basic and could use a little more creativity, but we were very happy with all of our meals. On the package deal, you can pretty much order anything on the menu, including specials. The only item we were told we could not order was the lobster and filet surf and turf that was a special one night. The service in the restaurants is friendly and attentive, but not intrusive. Tips are included with the meal package, but we tipped anyway. All of the servers initially tried to decline the tips, but we insisted. BEACH AND POOL: The beach is very small, but Pier House is one of the few places on the island that has its own beach. We preferred the pool, which was never overly crowded. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d sometimes have to wait an hour or two in a less than ideal location before some lounge chairs would open up in the sunny spots, but not a big deal. We still managed to get nicely browned. There is drink service by the pool if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re feeling lazy. Otherwise, you can get up and walk the 25 feet over to the bar. THE EMERGENCY: Unfortunately, on the morning of our third day, I got a call from back home about a serious family emergency. We had to leave almost immediately since we had driven down to Key West from New Jersey and needed to get home as soon as possible. The staff at Pier House was very understanding and compassionate. We spoke to the front desk and they assured us that even though their cancellation policy is seven days, they would refund us for our unused night. A few days later, I checked my credit card account online and sure enough, they had credited us the amount for the room. Pier House really came through for us. Just based on the kindness they showed us, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d definitely return. We had originally planned to take a leisurely ride home spending two nights in Savannah, two nights in Charleston, and a night in Virginia. The other hotels would not refund our money because of their cancellation policies. These other hotels told us that policies are policies and if they bent the rules for us, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have to bend them for all guests. Even though our trip was cut short and we missed our dinner at Little Palm Island, which we were really looking forward to, we loved our stay in Key West.

Although I appreciate her honesty and her willingness to help, I think that's pretty bad customer service. They need to offer a better discount than that considering the situation - honeymoon, not notifying us until now, not knowing where our room is in relation to the construction site, etc. Even if we are placed away from the site and are not too greatly affected when we're there, I will not book through this resort again and I will make sure to tell anyone who is considering Key West to do the same.

Before we booked it, I read numerous reviews on this and other sites. Some good, some not so good. I think what most travelers need to realize is that Key West is a unique place, with which comes a unique outlook/attitude from the locals. I'm hesitant to use the phrase 'party-central', but Key West, especially Duval Street is always busy, with loads of tourists enjoying the many bars, restaurants and attractions. The location of the Pier House is excellent - at the very beginning of Duval Street. Naturally, if you choose to stay in the middle of the action, you must also be prepared to hear a bit of the action from your room. It's rather difficult to get a real picture of the resort from their website, so I'll try to explain. The Pier House is a cluster of buildings, all opening on beautiful garden courtyard. The courtyard also contains a nice pool/hot tub. There are guest rooms in the \"Atrium\" building, which offers views on one side of the pool and atrium/garden area. The other side of the hall overlooks either the parking lot, or the front of the hotel (beyond the parking lot is Duval Street) - These are the rooms which others have commented as being noisy - they're also the cheaper rooms. The \"Conch\" building is adjacent to the atrium building and offers similar views. There's a newer building on the waterfront (I think it was called the beach house, but not sure of the name). This building has views of the water, or atrium, and is the most expensive of all. Trying to do our trip \"on the cheap\", we booked a standard room - Rm 187. The room was on the ground floor in the atrium building, and had a small patio on the garden, but was next to the hotel bar. Yes, the hallways are made of cementblocks, which doesn't give the best first impression, but you must also realize that due to the tropical design of the building, the hallways are not completely interior - although there are rooms on both sides of the halls, the end opens onto the outdoor courtyard - hence the outdoor-like materials used to construct the halls. The room itself was pleasant, the AC was rather noisy, bathroom small, but overall it was clean and comfortable, although I don't think I'd classify it as a 4-5 star. Other reviews have mentioned this room in particular as being especially noisy and generally not nice. Once again, if you choose to book the cheapest room in the hotel, you cannot expect to receive the room in the brochure or website. We were so tired from site seeing each night that we fell right to sleep, and weren't bothered by any noise. The staff was OK, but again, exhibiting that 'who cares' Key West attitude. I asked the front desk for an feather pillow at 10pm (the ones in the rooms are really hard and foam). I was told to check back in the morning!?!? \"But I'm not sleeping in the morning, I'm sleeping now\", I said. Still, no pillow - just check back in the morning?!?! There is security on site 24 hours, who keeps non-guests off of the private (topless) beach and pool. The pool/hot tub is open 24 hours, but be aware: it is closed every Wednesday from 10pm to 8am on Thursday morning for the weekly chemical treatment. (Something they don't tell you until you arrive!) Overall, I feel the Pier House is a good choice for anyone who wants to get out and walk around the city without the fuss of driving around (parking for one vehicle is included - parking is not easy to find in Key West). If you book a cheaper room, be prepared for something not quite as nice as the pics on the website, and something which may be a little on the noisy side. Regardless of the decor/location of your room, the pool and grounds are nice, hotel is generally clean, and a wonderful location.", "Date": "October 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "downriver mi.", "Title": "\u201cperfect 10 vacation\u201d", "Author": "kooz", "ReviewID": "UR6012656", "Content": "After 2 years without a vaction nothing but smiles help and clean fresh rooms everyday my wife and I are ready to book again and have told friends of an amazing time great job to all the staff MARK FROM MI.", "Date": "October 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, TX", "Title": "\u201cAbove Average\u201d", "Author": "MelinDallas", "ReviewID": "UR6002419", "Content": "My girlfriends and I stayed at the Pier House last October right before Hurricane Wilma headed over that way. Pluses: Location - It is right in the heart of where you need to be. Minutes from shopping, restaurants, bars, nightlife, etc. We never took a cab anywhere on island. It has a beach. Most hotels on this island do not have beaches as Key West really isn't known for it's beach space. The fact that they have this is nice, if it's what you want to do. The gardens are beautiful. It is landscaped very nicely and has a very luxurious and tropical feel. Staff. They were very friendly. Recommended some WONDERFUL restaurants. If you go to Key West, there is a sushi restaurant that is on one of the main streets that is the best sushi I have had in my life!!! Ask the guy at the front desk. Also, there's an italian restaurant called Antonio's - order the steak with the balsamic sauce. Incredible. I'm craving it! Minuses: The rooms weren't that updated. They had decent bathrooms and ammenities, but were not that attractive. The A/C unit kept leaking and it smelled pretty musty in the room the entire time. We asked maintenance to fix it, but they said it was normal condensation drip. Seemed like a lot to me. The carpet was soaked. Overall though, it was a good stay. I absolutely LOVE key west. Take the conch train tour, go to Sloppy Joe's after hours, take the tour of the island. We also took a day catamaran trip with water sports which was a lot of fun. If you're considering on whether to go to Key West or somewhere like Cancun/Mexico, you need to go to Key West. I've been to Mexico about 7 times. In Key West, it's not as expensive, you dont have to worry about the crime activity, everywhere is safe, and everyone speaks english.

Traditionally, we've stayed at the Ocean Key Resort (which is right across Duval Street from the Pier House). But, we've wanted to give the Pier House a try for the past few years. So we stayed there last week. The Pier House is perfectly located right on the water at the end of Duval Street, close to all of the Key West \"action\". We booked a harbor view room with had a big balcony overlooking the Gulf and a small balcony on the opposite side overlooking the pool with Duval Street in the distance. The room was fantastic. No complaints of any kind. There is some construction occuring right now, but that didn't interfere with our stay too much. My disappointments are associated with the staff. I am a very frequent traveller and am generally accostumed to standard levels of service. Keeping in mind that we were paying nearly $400 a night for our room, one expects that at least standard service levels should be in place. Now, I'm not hard to please. In fact, I am extremely easy going. Yet, the folks at the Pier House found a way to get on my nerves. We'll begin with check-in. By way of comparison, the Ocean Key Resort sends a bellperson to your room with you so as it will be easy to find, and they take the opportunity to show you where the pool is, tell you about any happenings, get you acquainted with the restaurants, etc. The person at the desk of the Pier House told us our room number and pointed out the door saying \"it's that way.\" The Pier House is comprised of several buildings, laid out in a \"village\", so room numbers are not as clear as in a single building hotel. After passing buildings with room numbers in the 800's and 100's and unsuccessfully finding ours, we returned to the lobby. This time, they found us a bellman (who didn't take our bags on a cart) and he led us to about what would be the halfway point to our room, pointed towards a building and said \"it's in there\" and then left. Again, we were on our own to figure out the numbering system. We spent another 10 minutes walking down hallways and around the building before we found it. Second disappointment was at breakfast the next morning. We ate at an outdoor patio restaurant that was plagued with pigeons. No problem, they just kind of hung around the tables, not too bothersome. However, one of the waiters thought it was fun to \"shoo\" them with a squirt bottle, causing them to fly away over diners heads. Even with some audible negative comments from other guests, he didn't take the hint and continued to spray away the pigeons which then became extremely annoying in their departures and returns. What he should have done is left them alone and attended to the tables he was completely ignoring in the mean time. Instead, we got food pitched at us and not a return visit until we were asked \"you done?\" Third disappointment came on check out day. Again, I travel all the time, I fly at least once or twice a month. Typically (everywhere from Ritz Carlton to Hampton Inn) I get the lobby concierge to print out a boarding pass for me in the morning. They are always cordial and are used to the request. Not so at the Pier House, I was instead directed to a \"pay per use\" internet kiosk in the lobby. \"That's what it's there for\" I was told. So, I walked across the street, saw the concierge who recognized me at the Ocean Key Resort, told him that I wasn't staying there this time, but asked if he could print out the pass for me. \"No problem\" was the response.

We were told work was only from 10-4 and would only last for one more day, when it was actually 8-6 and work was still going on days later after we left. It was so windy (high seas) this first week of October that we were stuck at the hotel beach listening to noisy construction, looking at construction men, and smelling balcony sealant the whole time we were there, and dealing with extremely rude and obnoxious, beach chair boys. Not at all the pleasant and relaxing Pier House that we remembered coming to over the years. The manager had said he would get back to me on Thursday after I had gone to him after the second beach chair man was so verbally rude, and he never did, and he was conveniently off Friday on checkout. The check out staff didn't apologize or even offer to have the manager call me . They must have new management and are going downhill. I recommend staying at the a larger hotels like the Ocean Key or Westin nearby where even if they are doing some construction you can get away from it easier , and offer much better customer service for the same rate !

The pool and spa were clean and a nice size. The best is where the Pier House is located it is right at the end of Duvall Street and you are in walking distance of everything. You have to check out the bar Sloppy Joes it's a fun place, good bands. If this is your first time going to Key West, Duvall Street is where all the action is. You can just walk from bar to bar drinking or store to store shopping. Don't forget to go to the Sunset Deck Bar at the Pier House for a drink and to watch the sunset, it's beautiful and romantic. I wouldn't suggest going to Mallory Square for the sunset unless you are looking for chaos which is what you will find there with all kinds of magicians and crazy performers and if a cruise ship comes in you won't see much of the sunset.

Due to some renovations we were upgraded to an ocean front room and the other family got a suite. We were both very happy. The front desk was wonderfully attentive and always helpful. The bed's were heavenly. Extremely comfortable and the air conditioning perfect. A small downside is the air conditioning exhaust is on the patio, making the 90 degree heat all that much hotter. We ate in at the pool restaurant twice and despite it being offseason and the restaurant empty, the food was very good. The french fries were excellent. The staff was very friendly and great with the kids. The beach area is quite small but there is a floating dock the kids enjoyed and it was all that we needed. One small downside is the lack of shade. However, since we were the only customer's at the bar/snack area she let us stay there since we could watch the kids from there. The only other shady area was the topless beach directly under the rooms and although no one was topless we didn't want to risk it. The pool was heavenly and not at all crowded.

I was worried about finding the right hotel and having beach access and the Pier House was perfect. My husband found the place from a Key West expert and we had it booked 9 months in advance. The pools were lovely and beach was small but nice. I was worried about the craziness of Fantasy Fest, since I really don't enjoy that stuff, but being at the Pier House made it nice. We got to attend the Pretenders in Paradise party/costume event, which was a whole different side to the event and very nice. The hotel was very specific about beach access and changes to the hotel property leading up to the event and tore down the stage very quickly after. We got to see the talent rehearse which was fun too and some of the celebrities that attended. I enjoyed having the hotel close to the parade route to see all the floats and people. It was neat to watch. My husband enjoyed venturing out to Duval Street to see the people and costumes at night - for the most part it was just people dressing up in costume and entertaining but there were some seedy people and lots of guys running around with lighted video cameras trying to get people on tape who were behaving badly. For me, I could watch for an hour or so, then it got boring. There was a street fair with vendors one afternoon as well that a lot of people seemed to enjoy. You are paying for privacy and beach access at this hotel. Most of the hotels at this time of year are geared toward the partiers and just have pools. This is probably one of the nicest hotels on the island with the best service available on the island. Remember this is a laid back place with a different pace. The hotel staff were friendly and offered lots of recommendations on places to eat and see. The beach is not big, but nice. I enjoyed having drinks and lunch (try the conch friitters) delivered to me at the beach every day, while there for five days. We took advantage of the fridge rental and stocked up on water, beer, mixers, and wine to enjoy without having to add to our bar bill. No one ever looked strangely at us. We enjoyed breakfast at the market place one morning, but mostly ventured out for other meals to local type places. I would love to go back and eat a 1 Duval Street at Sunset and Blue Moon, which we were unable to get into at that time. The property was close to everything, though we rented bikes for a few days to see more of the island. We enjoyed the Hemmingway House, Smathers Beach, the Lighthouse. We parked our car at the hotel and only moved it a couple times - this is a walking town. Also recommend going to see the view from one of the taller hotels to see the whole island. We loved the local artists and bought a lot of art from street vendors near the southernmost point. They are nice reminders of out time here. I loved the unique jewelry at the Emerald Lady, and hope to go back and get some pirate booty there some day. Our room was fine - on the first level of the garden near the pool. I was a little worried about security especially with all going on at the hotel and in town, but we had no problems. We wanted a King bed, but oly two doubles were available. The bedding could be upgraded at a place like this though. We had a nice terrace and the room was thoroghly cleaned daily.

The Pier House was very accommodating with that request and was able to help us. So on that note, the Pier House started off great in my book. We arrived to find a wonderful room. Its not the typical rectangle room, it was more of a square area which held the bed, tables, and lamps, with an extra area off the rectangle for the sink and shower. The sink was outside of the shower area which was nice because you don't have to worry about standing in a sauna after you showered. The shower area was a little small but your not living there so who cares. If you do stay there, request to be in the Atrium building in Room 294. You get a view of Duval St and a side view of the ocean and sunset. Its great!!! The room had wood laminate flooring, new looking tile in the bathroom area. The room had a lot of open space and you really didn't feel like you were in the standard hotel room. We didn't really watch much TV but they had a Flat Panel HD in the room. It was great. The bed was not hard and the sheets were very comfortable. Now, I mentioned we asked if they could accommodate us for 4 more days. They could not keep us in our original room, they mentioned we had to pay for an upgraded room to stay the other days. Now after this first room, I wondered what could an upgrade bring. Nothing.... Nothing.... but a standard hotel room with a side view of the ocean facing the marina. Also there was no balcony, where the balcony was they had enclosed an area with glass making a small sitting area. I felt like if I sat there I should pose like a Mannequin in a glass case. Little did I know, the Pier House has other plans for that small little area, you know for it be a like a greenhouse. We had to close the curtains between this stupid little balcony and the room just to keep the rest of the room cool. This room represents where not to stay in the Pier House, Beach Building in RM 224. In our first room we were 1 stair way from exiting the hotel. In our second room, we were one stair way, a 100 yard right turn and another 50 yard walk to the exit of the property. I asked the front desk, what's the upgrade??? I got a response that resembled we're full that's all that's left. I guess I should be happy I still had some where to stay but for an upgrade I should have at least been given some seeds and a watering can for my greenhouse. So be wary at this hotel if they say your going to have to pay for an upgrade. What that means is a farther walk out of the hotel from a room that resembles any normal hotel room but with a greenhouse for a balcony. Other than that little part of the hotel, Key West is great. Lots to do for 7 days but if you don't drink, those could be 7 long nights. So make sure you stay in the flat panel TV room!!! Also if you want to stay when things are really going on. Stay April 22 - April 29. This is when Key west celebrates it becoming the Conch Republic. You'll fast learn about this event when your down there. Also if you stay around that week, they will reenact the battle of Key west. You can pay to go on a boat and fling rotten tomatoes and eggs at the coast guard while they spray you with water. It sounds immature for an older crowd but its really fun if you just get in with the overall tradition of the event. Anyway its a great place with a lot to see and do. Take the Conch Train, it will show you lots of places to go on your own.

The pool area was above average and the beach is nice for Key west standards. The beach bar was pretty good there too and I started off my trip with a Pina Colada with a 151 floater, which was icing on the cake. The highlight of our stay was One Duval restaurant. Service was great even though there was a wedding dinner there. Snapper was the best I've ever had. Service was good, but not great at the hotel besides the restaurant. Tried to leave a wedding welcome gift and was told that I had to leave it on the day the guests arrived to guarantee its delivery. It was the only hotel that gave us this problem, which I found interesting.

The beach was nice and was private to the resort and although it was small, it was the best beach there was to offer in key west compared to the other hotels (we were nosey and checked them out). The beach staff gave out chairs and towels and raked it daily. The beach bar had good live music most of the time. The grounds and landscaping were well kept and pretty. Nothing was \"run-down\" or old. The prices we got for the Pier House were actually lower than most of the other hotels we looked into when booking and it was worth EVERY penny. There was not one bad thing to say about the Pier House. This was our first time in key west and this is the only resort we would ever consider WHEN we go back.

They have their own private beach which is VERY small, but adequate considering there is not much in the way of beaches down there! We loved it! The pool area and outdoor cafe were great. We often went for midnight swims on the beach and in the pool. We were only asked by a security guard to show him our room key to prove we were guests of the hotel. You are very near everything at this hotel - which was very nice. We parked our car in the lot the day we got there and didn't move it until we sadly had to leave. I've stayed at a bed and breakfast in key west before which I would recommend, but if you like something a little more \"resort\" like this is the place. I would prefer this over the hyatt they have down there too - the peir house has less of a hotel feeling. The carribean spa room was HUGE too. Our view wasn't the best. It was a parking lot, but mostly covered with foliage anyway. The room had a huge bathroom and a music system you could play throughout. We never turned the TV on the entire time we were there.

First of all we were in Key West this past week during spring break. We paid over $200 a night to stay in a standard room, which I think was attributed to it being spring break. Even though I booked last September, we were given room #190, right beside the lobby on the first floor. PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS ROOM. We could hear EVERYTHING, everyone coming in and leaving all during the night. The room itself was literally disgusting. There were water marks or mold on the ceiling and the walls. The bathroom was equally disgusting and had small bugs not only crawling on the floor, but also eating other dead bugs. They were charging $10 a week just to rent a refrigerator, and there were no machines on premises to buy a bottle of water unless you count the $7.00 Evian available to purchase in your room. Of course it was hot, unless you wanted to rent the refrigerator, which meant you would be essentially be drinking a $17 bottle of water. Thanks goodness there was a CVS across the steet! We even shared a balcony with the room next door, and after inspecting the sliding glass doors that adjoined the balcony I did not feel safe. We were on the bottom floor, I feel like anyone that got access to our balcony could have also gained access to the room if they so desired. Thank goodness there were two queen beds and we got our pick. One of them had a stain not only on the bedspread covering it, but the sheets were stained as well. The mattresses looked like something they salvaged from Goodwill and had definitely seen better days. After our first night we were getting ready to head out to explore Key West for the day when we happen to notice something on the pillow. It was a dead centipede! I have no idea how it got there, and quite frankly when paying as much as we did for a luxury resort, we shouldn't have to wonder such things. I can honestly say that the only good thing about this place was its location. It was nice to drink at the bars and then be able to walk home. The outside of the resort if you can call it that, is definitely deceiving. Bottom line is, the inside of the resort is pathetic. They have taken no measures to update the facilities, and have not gone out of their way to make the person staying there feel at home.

It was our second visit to the Pier House, the first being our honeymoon 18+ years earlier. We reserved a basic room and it was on the first floor, near the lobby. The only negative was our room's patio was right across from the Chart Room bar and adjacent to a main walkway, so there was some noise. We're not terribly bothered by noise and most nights we were bone tired so it wasn't a big deal. I could see fussy types being annoyed by this. If so, avoid room 187. All of Key West showed a lot of damage to trees and vegetation due to the recent hurricane season. Things at the PH looked surprisingly good, but some of the taller palm trees clearly took a beating. All the grounds were neatly maincured and well maintained. The pool and beach area were in good shape. The water temperature in the pool was perfect. The nearby jacuzzi was great too and was very relaxing after a hard day spent being a tourist. Waitresses are very attentive to both beach and pool patrons all day. One of the PH's best features is the location. It's just a few blocks from all of old town KW's main attractions. We had a car the first few days we were there and they have lots of free parking. I seem to recall that parking was more limited 18 years ago. The biggest knock against the PH is the price. It's nice but expensive. I don't expect budget prices, but I never saw any drink specials or anything remotely resembling a discount. A Coors Light ran $4.50, a mojito or margarita was $7.50 or $8.00 and the very tasty Key Lime colada a whopping $11.00. We're not heavy drinkers, but if you are it might be good to drink elsewhere. We did some other sidetrips while there. My wife did the sea lion swim at Theater of the Sea in Islamorada and we took a seaplane to the Dry Tortugas. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
