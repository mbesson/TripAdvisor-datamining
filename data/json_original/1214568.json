To explain\u2026. We went to view the hotel in February 2010 as a possible venue for our wedding reception. Contrary to many reviewers on here we actually really liked the d\u00e9cor and fell in love with the place. The then Food and Beverage Manager was an absolute delight and couldn't do enough to help us achieve what we hoped within our budget. We spent several months working with him to develop a menu and specification for the day, including all the little personal touches we dreamed of. Everything seemed perfect, so we went ahead and booked the date. Much correspondence followed to confirm all the details in writing, and all that remained was to pay the deposit, which he suggested holding back until our ceremony venue was confirmed, in case of a date change. We were a little concerned after a fire at Easter, and disappointed that the lounge was not redecorated as promised to the same luxurious finish. Still, everywhere else was the same and we remained very excited about our special day. Once our ceremony venue was confirmed, we immediately instructed No 11 to take our deposit and then we painstakingly hand made and sent out 180 invitations. We were initially a little alarmed when the Food and Beverage Manager, who we had been dealing with regularly for many, many months, suddenly left out of the blue, with only a few days notice. We were even more concerned to discover that our deposit had not actually been taken. However, we were relieved when his temporary replacement confirmed that he had given her everything we agreed in writing, which would of course would be honoured, and our deposit was to be taken immediately. A few days later we were contacted by the Manager, who proceeded to renege on almost everything we had agreed. Despite an extensive email trail with proof of authorisation of all the details of the booking, the hotel essentially broke contract and refused to honour most of it. The Manager\u2019s attitude was extraordinary and she was extremely rude and patronising. We immediately arranged a meeting with her to try and sort out the situation. It soon became clear that she was related to the owner, had no concept of customer service and next to no experience of running any kind of event. She had decided to hold this difficult meeting in the public lounge in front of several other guests \u2013 presumably to make us feel very uncomfortable. She succeeded \u2013 it was very strange and terribly embarrassing for both us and the other hotel guests who overheard the entire conversation. Despite our efforts to understand her point of view and compromise so we could move forward, she adamantly refused to discuss anything other than a new, non-negotiable contract which was far-removed from our initial brief and financially unrealistic in view of the agreed budget. With communications broken down between us, and naturally feeling we could no longer be objective about the situation, my close friend, who is very experienced in these matters and lives in the local area, then visited the hotel to see if she could help in any way. She was told the Manager was in a meeting but my friend said she was happy to wait until she was finished. Having waited over an hour to see her, being constantly told that she would be a few minutes, she was finally informed that the Manager had left for the day. (Obviously via the back door to avoid passing my friend in the lobby.) At this point, we could only wonder just what the wedding would have been like if it had gone ahead under her instruction. With only 8 weeks to the wedding and Christmas in the middle too, the Manager gave us the choice of finding another c\u00a35K or walking away. We were left with no option but to go elsewhere; a very embarrassing situation in light of the fact we had sent out all the invitations a month before. I cannot begin to describe the stress, disappointment and fear we experienced and I still have nightmares about it even now. Thankfully, we did find another venue and our wedding was absolutely beautiful. However, this was no thanks to No 11. My advice is that this is a shoddy, over-priced, poorly run outfit with no concern for customer service or reputation. Our biggest lesson and strongest regret is that we didn\u2019t listen to the countless negative reviews on this site beforehand. We're still considering legal action as we are informed we have a very strong case - the only reason we haven\u2019t yet gone ahead is that don't want to mar the memory of our (eventual) dream wedding that we very nearly didn't get!", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cReally disappointed\u201d", "Author": "fitness1972", "ReviewID": "UR115623418", "Content": "I stay in many 5* apartments and hotesl in London and thought I would try this hotel.

The staff seem totally disconcerned and indifferent as to whether we were there or not which I found disguisting. The only saving grace was the manager on duty was up when I dragged my bones downstairs at 7am to the gym as failed to sleep well and I told her how unhappy we were. It didn't seem to go in so I walked off in the end, then when I came back up she was still there and she was very apologetic with me and has asked me to come back complimentary which I will do, if only to hope the whole experience improves greatly.

A few of the rooms have been renovated (the more expensive ones) but the majority are worn and very disappointing.

It used to be the best around. The staff in the dining room area spent most of the time standing around complaining about their poor work conditions.

The whole purpose of staying in such an expensive hotel was to have a relaxing and luxurious time for a special occasion (my husbands 40th). It's very cosy, we loved the decor and our room (no 006) was very comfortable and VERY peaceful considering it was on the ground floor, and in central London. The room was described as a suite but was really just a reasonable sized room with a large enough table to eat a meal at, and a with very luxurious marble bathroom. The hotel advertises its spa facilities, but these are booked with outside therapists. We had booked a massage and reflexology treatment to finish off our day out and set the mood for a relaxing evening. The therapists arrived at the hotel dead on the time we had booked and we went down to the basement treatment rooms. My treatment room was fine but my husband said his was very basic with no music. Neither of the therapists were qualified to do reflexology so that was a big disappointment as it is my favourite spa treatment so I had to settle for a massage, not wanting to make a fuss and spoil the mood. The treatments were perfectly adequate but it was a real shame that I couldn't have the treatment I had booked. We ordered breakfast in our room the next morning. First of all they had forgotten our newspaper, then when they brought the breakfast, had forgotten the fruit salad, and they brought about 20 slices of toast and only one tiny square of butter. Our final bugbear was that they had valet-parked our car for us when we arrived but when we checked out we were told no-one was available to collect our car and we had to walk to the car park (a totally separate, NCP-type carpark) which was a few minutes walk away. The total bill, for one night, breakfast, no evening meal but just one club sandwich, bottle of champagne, two spa treatments and car parking came to \u00c2\u00a3800. And of course there was an extra charge on our bill for the breakfast which should not have been there, as it was included in our room tariff. This has happened to us in every posh hotel we have ever stayed in. My advice is - check the bill!
