{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good value This place offers good value. It is not five stars (probably 3.5). You can commute easily to different spots in Beijing for a reasonnable price. I had a one bedroom (studio type) which was fine.Not knowing any chinese can be a problem in this part of town. Even the best english speaking member of the staff could not understand what I was saying when asking if they had a business center so I could print something with my laptop. i don't think the staff in the reataurants of the area speak any english, not even at KFC. This is not a problem for me but potential clients should know this.The rooms are cleaned every day. The towels are a bit thin.The main advantage is that the price is right for this location at a tad less than 400RMB ($50) but you need to haggle a little - again - a few words of chinese will help. There is a supermarket downstairs as well as a 7-11 and various restaurants (Chinese).Finding a taxi during rush hours can be a challenge. I had to join a friend one morning and at 7h30am it took me 30 minutes to hail one not busy!", "Date": "Oct 18, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR231326378", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "JPDeM"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d652631-r10106560-Free_Town_Apartment_Hotel_of_Beijing-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "652631", "Price": "$62"}}
