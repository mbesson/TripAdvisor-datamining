Just got back from Miami and I had a great time. Okay the hotel is old and a little run down, but for the price you are steps away from a beautiful quiet beach. So what if the rooms are not the hilton all we needed was a bed, everything you need is walking distance. The people in Sunset Isle are the nicest and most helpful. We are from Kissimmee 3 hours north the people here could take a lesson from the people there. We will go back and we will stay at The Golden Nugget.

This is the worst hotel in the US!! If you go to this hotel expect all of the following:* no personnel to check you in before 10 am or after 11:30 pm. (You will have to wait until the next morning)* to pay $10 for you room's key (we did not get our money back, even though they called it deposit)* A receptionist who does not speak english*A room with not telephone, iron, coffee maker, etc* The AC was too old to work appropriately. You will have to wake up in the middle of the night to turn it off, if you do not want to be frozen in the morning.*The remote control did not work.*The sheets were filthy, they had yellow and brown stains.*My sister's room had a strong smell, from some kind of pesticide.* The bathroom was full of fungus*The smoke detector was without batteries.*The sink was being hold in place by a cane*The door was hard to open and almost impossible to lock.The only good thing about this place (called hotel) is its location.If you decide to go anyways, take sheets and towels with you. We did not do it and terefore we ended up buying them at Walmart. Believe me! It could ruin your vacations, you need to rest on a matress where you can sleep without rolling over your husband, and if you get sick like some of us did the difference in the price you are going to spend it on medical costs.

This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. We arived at 9:30 AM and we found out that they reception desk was opened only from 10 AM to 12AM.

So we wanted to use the TV, but the remote control was not working!!! The room was awful. The bathroom did not have space for the toilet paper, so it was on the floor.

When we first got to the hotel there was no staff at the front desk. There was a phone number for us to call but no phone. We had to use our cell phone to call and the woman at the other end said she would be there in 10 minutes. She pulled up about 30 minutes later arms full of shopping bags. We received a key for the first room and the woman complained to us that we probably won't give her a deposit for the key because we booked through Orbitz. We got into the room after a struggle with the key. Doors would not lock properly and the room was absolutely disgusting. The sheets were filthy and the room stunk! We complained at the front desk that we wanted our money back but we were informed that since we did not book directly with them that we had to call Orbitz. We called Orbitz and were told that if the manager would allow us a refund that we would get one. Apparently the manager is never on sight, so needless to say we did not get a refund. We did, however, get a different room. The room was an improvement over the previous but the sheets were still filthy. We complained again and watched the cleaning crew as they put fresh sheets on the beds. All of this happened within the first two hours of our trip to Miami.

Our room was clean and quiet and the staff friendly and more than eager to address our needs. The manager gladly offered us another room because the first room we had needed a lot of work even though we were only there for three nights. He explained that nothing had been done to the place because they were unsure if it would be sold and torn down. Now, that their future is secure, he said, improvements are on the way. The location is perfect; steps to the beach, a variety of stores and restaurants across the street, and public transit at the front door. It is definately not a Hilton or a Sheraton but for the price, well worth it.

Well we didnt want South Beach...we wanted a more quiet place and Sunny Isles was perfect...his attitude was not. He claimed that the yellow and black stains on our sheets were bleech stains...well Ive never seen a golden yellow bleech stain before. NASTY!!!!! This manager is a disgrace to all hotell managers and he showed this by yelling at not only us but at two guests that were just checking in. He doesnt care about your stay if you have any problems with reservation or room he will just tell you to take it up with the travel agency and does not offer to help at all. He pretty much told us that he could care less because he has new people coming. Well this is a --- hotell and you dont get what you pay for.
