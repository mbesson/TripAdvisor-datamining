{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Wonderful Hotel A great hotel within a businesscomplex on the 33-38th floor with wonderful views over Tokyo skyline, next to Sumida river. Large reception at ground floor with excellent service. The two elevators goes directly to the floors between 33 and 38th floor. There are a lot of shops on the ground floor close to the hotel. The rooms are large by Tokyo standard. I also received a english newspaper every morning to my room with no extra charge. The roms are very very clean with everything you need. I stayed on the 34th floor and had a spectacular view of southeast Tokyo. There are also a superb lounge in the center of the hotel at the 32-38th floor.

We even saw Mt Fuji on 2 mornings in April from our bedroom window. When arriving with suitcases try getting off at the southern part of Tsukiji subway as there is a lift.The northern exit (Near Denny's) is closer to the hotel though there are a lot of stairs. I was concerned about hard beds due to previous reviews. Yes the beds are firm and even though I like a soft bed it wasn't too bad and we slept well. Internet in lobby 100yen for 10min.

This hotel is right on the Sumida River, with great views from the room as well as the restaurant.

Arriving at the Tokyo station on the Narita Express is the simple part. We decided that after a long flight we will not try to master Tokyo's subway system that day and took a taxi to the hotel (1300 yen). The hotel is in a building along with offices and a hospital (St. Luke's). This is a little confusing until you see the sign for the hotel. Staff were polite and limited in their English skills. An earlier reviewer mentioned that the hotel decor is a bit eighties, which is absolutely true. However, the view that awaits the guest from the room is beautiful. Rooms were clean. Massage chair a nice touch (although being tall and not japanese sized the massage can be interesting).The hotel seems to be popular with Japanese visitors as well as Westerners. Food: there are several restaurants within the building, also a Mc Donald's and a 7-11 store.Location: 3-4 blocks from the Tsukiji Station. 15-20 min. walk to Ginza (going straight from the hotel entrance). 25-30 min. walk to Tokyo Station (without luggage).I would definitely stay there again.

The New Hankyu was excellent most areas. We arrived early, and they would not let us check in early, but we managed to store our bags. Once we checked in, we found the place excellent. Location was superb. We could walk to Ginza in about 15 minutes. We walked to the imperial palace in about 20-25 minutes. It was close to the train stations, and location overall was excellent. The room was very very large for Japanses hotels. The service was always excellent. The bed was hard as a rock, but ok for us. The massaging chair was nice, but would have been of more use if I found the instructions on the first day of our stay, not the last. To get there from the airport catch the limo bus to TCAT terminal (2900 yen each). Then catch a taxi to the building. This will cost abouut 1200 yen. Things to do. Check out the fish markets, or Ginza. Catch a subway to akihabara. Catch a short train trip to Tokyo Disneyland. Walk around Tokyo.

The view that greeted me when I got in the room was unbelievable and made the whole thing seem like excellent value for money.

Also I had two pillows, one very hard, one very soft so no complaints there.Went to the bar one evening (you know - looking for Scarlett Johanson!) and couldnt get in as was full, but had a quick look out the window and discovered it had exactly the same view as my room - but a couple of floors down so it didnt matter at all.Only criticism is that the hotel feels a bit 80's still, but that is a minor complaint at this price, with that view and the excellent position.Highly recommended.", "Date": "Dec 28, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR908410701", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "JimmyHuntspill"}, {"Content": "Comfortable, but bad mattress               More photos", "Date": "Nov 5, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR803374658", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Very comfortable, large room, great view We greatly enjoyed our stay at the New Hankyu Tokyo for our first three nights in Japan.
