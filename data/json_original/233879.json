Rooms include a hot plate, microwave, tea kettle and some even have a balcony. There's an actual laundry room in the basement where you wash/iron your own clothes. Not bad for an extended stay. If you're traveling with a child or an extra person, request a room with a pull-out couch so you don't have to pay the extra 40 Euros per night for a rollaway bed. Otherwise, the couch is an option but it's pretty uncomfortable. We racked up a bill for 320 Euros for 8 days(adds up fast!) just for the bed...However Adina hotel (up the street) has nice rooms (same type) except smaller -I prefer to say more intimate but equally nice, clean, and a bit more convenient -washer/dryer in your room- either way 60sqm vs 43...you decide! Adina cost 580 Euros for the week, while Mandala was roughly 800 in addition to the expensive rollaway bed! Back to Mandala--There's an exercise room and sauna/quiet room on the top (8th) floor where you can catch a nice sunset while sipping tea. Sauna is VERY clean by the way...I didn't have breakfast there - No need when I can cook my own but it might be something to do on your last day just for the view - I think got the same view drinking tea without the paid breakfast! BTW, there are two grorcery stores very close(Kaisers and Ullrich). 15 minutes walk further is Friedrichstrasse station, there's an Edeka in there but it gets crowded. I didn't drive but I know there's limited underground parking. Internet is great and free. As for negatives---The pillows are lousy! You can fold them in fours and still feel like your head rests on nothing. The rollaway bed which I already mentioned and be careful so they don't try to charge you for anything extra like they did me - pistachios. Mini bar is not free, neither is the chocolate but walk 2 minutes to Fassbender and Rausch for chocolates---You won't regret it!", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockholm", "Title": "\u201cA perfect located apartment hotel in Mitte Berlin\u201d", "Author": "Molokoo", "ReviewID": "UR127259789", "Content": "I have stayed there a total of four times during 2009-2010 and have enjoyed every stay.

We had a separate bedroom, with a sliding (pocket) door to the living room (shut at night but open during the day), a kitchen and a luxurious bathroom with an enormous tub. Excellent toiletries. The draperies worked beautifully to darken the room at night, and the floor-to-ceiling windows opened both at the top and side to give great ventilation. For everything we received, the price was reasonable (150 Euros/night). The bed (kingsize) was perfect -- not overly firm and not too soft and the bedding was high quality. Windows overlooked a street combining older buildings with carved facades and modern architecture. The room was quiet; we heard no noise from neighbors or from the street. Breakfast was outstanding -- a fantastic selection of meats, cheeses, pastries, great yogurts with muesli, eggs, even outstanding coffee and cappuccino -- and in a beautiful room with a view of the rooftops in the area. We commented on the pastries since they were so extraordinarily good, unlike the typical fare, and found out that they get them fresh every morning from one of the best bakeries in town. That commitment to quality showed in every aspect. Newspapers in several languages, including the International Herald Tribune, were available in the breakfast room. The location in the Mitte can't be beat: a 2-minute walk to the Gendarmenmarkt with two beautiful churches and the concert hall and outdoor cafes (and almost constant live music by groups outside these cafes), and 1/2 block to the underground. The hotel is located in a business/retail section, which is a bit surprising, but so close to the cafes and restaurants of the Gendarmenmarkt area (which clearly attracts both locals and tourists) that it feels very homey. You can walk almost everywhere if you have good shoes, even to the beautiful and artsy Prenzlauerberg (about 3 miles, or an hour on foot). The Mandala Suites a concierge, but the staff on the first floor are extremely helpful. (We bought full-day metro passes from them directly, which was very useful.) We didn't check to see if room service was available, but with cafes and restaurants everywhere, and the amazing breakfasts, you won't want it. They have a small fitness area with a sauna which looks quite nice (we peeked in) but we didn't use it. Wifi (very good signal) was available at a reasonable price if you purchase a whole week, and somewhat less reasonable at a daily rate. This would be the one thing I would encourage the management to reconsider. I've stayed in dozens of great hotels in Europe, India, Japan, So. America, the U.S. and this is one of my favorites. Berlin is an amazing cosmopolitan city, and this is the best place to stay in our opinion. We loved this hotel and plan to return. One tip -- we highly recommend visiting the Stasi Prison (Hohensch\u00f6nhausen Memorial Center) on the outskirts of Berlin.

I was needing this kind of room for six nights (July 4 - 9, 2010) while visiting Berlin and Germany for the very first time just prior to a visit I was making to Finland to visit special friends of mine there. The Mandala Suites was perfect for me and was the ideal location that I needed and was looking for. Located approx. three blocks south of Unter den Linden, the main east-west thoroughfare through central Berlin (formerly East Berlin, the Mandala Suites is located on energetic and cosmopotlitan Friedrichstrasse, which is overflowing with contemporary restaurants, shops, etc. It is also conveniently located to the U-bahn or subway system. Taxis make frequent and regular stops in the vicinity as well, which I needed and took advantage of on a number of occasions, though I walked Berlin most of the time and/or participated in guided \"themed\" walking tours of Berlin on 4 of the 6 days during my visit. The only two things I would say were a negative or a slight negative were the following: 1) Though the buffet breakfast that the hotel offers on the 7th or 8th floor was excellent and very convenient (I ate breakfast there each morning during my stay), it was 18 Euros per breakfast, which I thought was a bit expensive and over the top. I did not realize that breakfast was 18 Euros / breakfast until the moment I was checking out of the hotel. I have only myself to blame for this, because I should have asked them in advance how much breakfast cost.....I normally ask these kinds of questions in advance, but due to travel overload and too much to think about and to do after arriving in Berlin, I simply never got around to asking this most important question. I certainly will not repeat this mistake in the future, no matter where I travel or stay. However, the service was excellent, the view of the city from the restaurant was wonderful, I enjoyed reading the complimentary English language newspaper that was available to me and to others, so all in all, I took advantage of all that was offered me and was glad that I did once I found out the cost of the breakfast. 2) Even though the bathroom in my suite was large, very clean, brighly lit and well appointed, I have to say that the tub itself was very dangerous and was / is a problem just waiting to happen to someone. It was very slippery inside the tub and when I went to get in and out of the tub each morning, I had to do so with extreme care and caution for fear of slipping and falling down. There definitely should be some kind of safey mat on the floor of the tub to prevent people from potentially falling and seriously hurting themselves. I am certain that I am not the first person who has ever noticed and/or mentioned this. The flooring in the bathroom is all smooth polished tile that becomes very slippery once it becomes wet. I had to always place a towel just outside my tub to make sure I landed on a secure surface when getting out of the tub each morning. The Mandala Suites management most definitely needs to reexamine its current design plans for its bathrooms, as they are a serious problem just waiting to happen to someone.", "Date": "July 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "athens", "Title": "\u201cWonderful stay in a snowy Berlin\u201d", "Author": "dk1174", "ReviewID": "UR70625874", "Content": "I spent 5 days at a suite at Mandala suites during February 2010. 5 very very relaxing days in such a cozy and charming environment.

I loved the decor of the public spaces (restaurant, hallways, gym), but the rooms themselves, while very large suites, are very boring in their decor, sort of stilted and classic I guess you would say. This is very different from the Mandala Hotel, though the Suites are a good bit less expensive. The breakfast room has a great view onto the city and the staff are quite helpful and nice. A limited number of bikes are available to guests free of charge, which is a great touch, just reserve early or they will be gone.

We have deeply appreciated the possibility of going in and out of the hotel without passing for reception because that allow you to have the illusion of living the city.

The staff helped us with everything we need. We had only a small problem. The third day, the fridge was spoilt and despite we remarked it in reception, it wasn't repaired. Another negative point is that the breakfast, although it was abundant, seemed us too expensive (18\u20ac). I also think that a hotel of this category should have free wifi in the rooms for their customers, and not only one Internet free point in the lounge that it's opened only during the breakfast.

There are two Mandalas (a Hotel and Suites) which may be confused from the Mandala web site. This is the Suites and not the design Hotel (which also consists of suites) in the nearby Potsdamer Platz. On to the review... The location is superb. A block from the beautiful Gendarmenmarkt, near to many restaurants, and on the Friedrichstrasse shopping street, the Suites are located about 1/2 mile from the Museums Insel and the bulk of the sights in the historical quarters. The U-bahn runs just underneath providing fast, easy access to the farther reaches of the city. The style and feel of the Mitte in the eastern half is quite different from that of the western half. We loved it. We booked a Management Suite (their smallest) for a very fair price. It had a whopping 68 square meters; a combined living/sleeping room; a separate, equipped kitchen; a large, sparkling bathroom with big towels; and a balcony. No rooms with twin beds are available, so it may not be suitable for travel with a business associate. The decor was bland with bamboo furniture, but they hung nice old photos, and everything was kept clean. The arrangement is like an apartment complex. The front desk is in a separate area of the building, so one has ample privacy when coming and going. N.B. The staff is only on duty until the evening hours on weekdays and late afternoon on weekends, so take this into consideration if you must check in late or if you require advice, assistance, etc. The helpful staff will arrange most amenities for their guests: personal shoppers, baby sitting, rental cars, massage, flowers, etc. Free washing machines, loaner bikes, and laptop/DVD's are also available. DSL and wireless internet are 10 euros per day. The rooms have air-conditioning and safes (not laptop-sized). On the top floor, the breakfast room is drenched with light. If you don't get breakfast included in your rate, it is 18 euros. Eggs can be cooked to order, and there are over 100 tiny dishes of things to sample. But the content is still the German-style breakfast with meats, cheeses, and breads. In the future, I will request a room on a higher floor. There was almost no cell phone coverage from two different companies; and being on the first floor, I could hear the subway trains rumble through underneath every 4 minutes, vibrating the room like a didgeridoo.

The rooms are starting at 40 sqm up to more than 80 sqm - all with kitchen. No extremly stylish furniture - discreet elegance might a proper description. Comfortable beds, ok--ish bathrooms. No extravaganza. Wireless and LAN costs 10 \u20ac a day. The six day access is for 30 \u20ac - easly calculation what is the better choice. Connectivity inbound is ok, outbond can be a catastrophy, if you are not only checking your emails on the internet but work with an application such as Outlook, Lotus Notes etc. Room orientation varies pretty much - some are towards the glass attrium, which is a really calm place, others have windows and balconies to Friedrichstrasse (noisy) or attached streets (rel. noisy as well). Breakfast room on the 8th floor has very modern interieur, but - far too less tables. It can easly happen to you that you have to sit on the couch and wait for several minutes to get a table - unpleaseant, when you have time pressure.

It was nice that they had left the couch untouched and added an extra bed - so we could still sit and enjoy the sitting area), both rooms had a TV and a CD player in the living room; - 1 fully equipped kitchen open into the living room (incl microwave, fridge, dishwasher and everything you need to eat/cook) ; - 1 bathroom with separate toilet; plus - a huge empty hall (a bit of a waste of space in our view - would have been better planned if used for a bigger bathroom... or some sitting furniture) with a walk-in closet. The suite also has a small balcony overlooking a courtyard, not very pretty but the court is certainly extremely quiet and much calmer than the busy Friedrichsstrasse on the other side. I believe most ,if not all, rooms overlook the courtyard. Breakfast was nice served in a very modern lounge on the top floor with nice views.
