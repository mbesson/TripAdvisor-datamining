This hotel is surrounding with high-end shops like Tods in the right side and Furla in front of it. I love every alley in this area.

I was so very pleased with La Lumiere.. after seeing few pleasant reveiws on trip advisor I was initially hesitant, but this hotel turned out to be one of the best hotels that I exerienced during my 3 week sojourn through Europe. Lu Lumiere set a wonderful tone and high standard in all important travel areas. Location, Staff, Room Comfort, Staff and Cost 1)Location.. the hotel is literally a stone's through to The Piazza di Spagna, wonderful shops of all sorts from Gucci and Prada to local neighborhood shops where you can have a great gelato or buy local wines and othe goods. 2) The staff was amazing especially Letizia. They staff was always pleasant and extremely helpful. Within a day of booking my hotel they sent me a welcome email and began corresponding regularly with me regarding my trip and potential needs. They arranged a driver from the airport who although my flight was nearly 4 hours late.. was patiently there waiting with a personalized name placard when I arrived. When I saw the Coliseum I gasped! It was so amazing to actually see it and the driver who recognized my response pulled off and offered to take a picture with me in front. I will always treasure this first picture which began my experience in Rome! I left my translator book in the car and the driver returned 2 hours later to return it to me! The hotel itself provided me with excellent point to point directions to my business site locations and to every other venue that I desired to explore.. all of which were in walking distance of the hotel. If you are up for it, there is no venue that you cannot either walk or easily train to. The rooms are in the traditional Itlaian style and very welll kept. The rooms are clean and the breakfast area is very lovely atop the buiding. My linens were comfortable and crispy. The Jacuzzi shower was a plus at the end of the long day.. and the room was spacious enough and very relaxing. I believe the room was worth every euro and would stay there again, especially in the room with the small terrace, which was great for relaxing after a long day in Rome.

Overall, I think there is hope for this hotel given its location and fairly well-appointed rooms, but some personnel and policy changes are needed to make guests feel more at home.", "Date": "December 10, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful stay\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1401451", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at La Lumiere in March of 2003. Not only did we find the hotel beautifully decorated and very clean, but found the staff to be especially helpful with directions, suggestions and arrangements for departure to the airport. It's location is absoulutley perfect for ease of access to many different areas of Rome for sightseeing but also for night time dining and strolls. We did hear some street noise as a low hum (like white noise) but when we're in Italy we consider it part of the experience. Nonetheless we were able to sleep there for three nights so well so that each day we walked the whole of Rome and never took a taxi, bus or metro anywhere we went. We would highly recommend it!", "Date": "October 22, 2003"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "La Lumiere di Piazza di Spagna", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d275769-Reviews-La_Lumiere_di_Piazza_di_Spagna-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$171 - $341*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">via Belsiana, 72</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00187</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "275769", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/91/6d/916db3be547a5457fb63bdf2038c0c7d14large.jpg"}}
