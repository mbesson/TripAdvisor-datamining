Hotel is pretty basic but good value for money. I traveled alone. Got a room with a double bed without an extra charge. Staff was helpful when I had questions how to get around Istanbul and how to get to the racetrack. I got free pick-up from the airport. If I had booked 5 days, I would get a free drop-off to the airport. I managed to go back to the airport by using metro (10 minute walk from the hotel). Rooms are a bit small. This wasn't a problem for me as I was single. I could imagine it would be crowded if I was traveling with someone and staying in the same room. Walls are a bit thin. This wasn't a big problem except for one night when my Japanese neighbors decided to have loud conversation at 1am. Few knocks on the wall solved this. Breakfast was nice, although I'm not that picky when it comes to food. Location is fine. The hotel is 5min walk and the 2 or 3 stops by tram from historical sites. Taksim area is a bit further away, but easily reachable by public transport and/or walk. Valens Aqueduct is nearby. Also a couple of Mosques. If I ever go to Istanbul again, I would probably try to be closer to Taksim square if possible. I found myself going to Taksim area more often than not because of good choice of cheap restaurants and cafes. There are restaurants and cafes close to Maya, but I found them a bit overpriced. To summarize: I doubt I would find a better hotel for the money I paid. There are certainly hotels better located, with better rooms and service, but they cost more. Maya hotel is a good compromise between all these factors.", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cClean and Basic\u201d", "Author": "casspb", "ReviewID": "UR109263405", "Content": "We stayed here as part of a package while in Istanbul for the F1 Grand Prix. It is a basic 3 star hotel may be old, but is clean. Staff were lovely even though English is not readily spoken. Breakfast provided is an European breakfast so do not expect bacon & eggs. You will get cheese, bread, salad etc though there was usually 1 hot dish. We didn't find the walk to the Bazaar too long, probably about 15 -20 minutes. It is also close to several restaurants and taxis are plentiful.

I think the hotel was also run buy Russians. All the staff was friendly but could not speak English. There were lots of shops selling fur jackets next to the hotel. And a taxi rank point 1 minute away. The room faced the main road but was quite; the AC unit worked well and was definitely required. A small old empty fridge was also present in the room. Good for storing drinks & water or milk. The television also worked but did not see any English channels. There was a large breakfast buffet selection, and the staff was very friendly & helpful. There was hot water for the shower and the bathroom functioned fine, I think the colors of the rooms let the place down everything was green. If you are looking for basic, clean hotel where you just want to sleep & have breakfast & explore Istanbul then this is fine. If you are going to spend a lot of time in the hotel then I suggest somewhere else.", "Date": "February 20, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Maya Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d295170-Reviews-Maya_Hotel-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$70 - $100*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">5 Fevziye Caddesi</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Sehzadebasi</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Istanbul</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">34470</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Turkey</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "295170", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/7f/a4/7fa47df727f58533284e2c41f29af5ba1large.jpg"}}
