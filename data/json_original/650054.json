Woke up to 2 employees screaming in our beautiful view of the parking area in the middle of the motel. There is a sound that can only be described as a thunderous roar as someone walks by the room (on your floor or above). 22 dollar/nt \"free\" parking that is valet only, unless you arrive late at night, then you park yourself and still get to pay 22 dollars. The place has great curb appeal but once you leave the lobby its quite different than what you would expect. Very contemporary feel in the lobby, very Motel 6 when you get out of the elevator and into the room. On the upside, the employees are fantastic, the location is great.

The hotel building is indeed old, and the rooms felt like renovated and dressed up old rooms, but they did quite a good job on it. The King deluxe with the balcony had new toilet and bathtub and felt very fresh, bed was super comfortable with thick mattress, had refrigerator and microwave, there was some ocean view on the side of the balcony. The double queen room was large, had old toilet and on-floor-shower, but definately no mold and was clean. Mattresses were super thick. TVs were flatscreens and bright in both rooms. All locks and doors worked fine. The only thing we didn't like was The glass door restaurant which is kind of a separate business obviously popular with public, so we let them have it the way it is. Its not just overpriced, its uneatable. There's plenty alternative places to eat in the area. The other thing I liked was how quiet it was being a block away from India street. Rooms were cleaned as expected, service was not annoying. We had quite a pleasant experience. Vallet parking is 22 dollars though. Parking on the street is possible, not on Saturday or Friday night, and you have to pay at the meter anyway.

There is a Days INN up the street that I loved, even that is an avg of half this hotels price. THE ROOMS AVERAGE like 150. Shower looked like it was made by a 3 year old in the arts and crafts room.

I had seen bad reviews on http://tripadvisor.com but I brushed it off hoping that my experience would be different. The hotel from the outside looks good and the lobby area is clean and modern, but I can't say the same for the rooms, very, very disappointing!! From what i saw on the outside compared to the room was a disaster! I got a standard room with one queen bed and the room is TINY! My bedroom alone is bigger than the room! There was barely any room to fit my twin sized air mattress, and the room definitely needs renovation ..from the furniture, to the T.V, to the bathroom. I'm not claustrophobic, but staying in that room made me uncomfortable because there was no actually walking space and everything was so close to each other.

Dumb remarks like \"don't stay here, the manager wasn't nice to us\" are not helpful. So I wasn't sure what we'd think. So after two nights at the Porto Vista, here's my own two cents/recommendations : 1. The location is great. I wouldn't want to be right on India street for noise reasons. The airplanes come close, but as soon as we closed our balcony door it was quiet. We let them pick us up at the airport and waited to rent a car while we did city stuff--so parking not a problem. 2. Beds are super comfortable. After walking around the city and Balboa Park we slept like logs. 3. Great to have a fun place for an end of the day cocktail--great view a bonus (Glass Door). 4. Spring for a larger room. It's still small but you'll be able to walk around. 5. Daytime management seems with-it, night-time staff not as much. But they did give us some towels and coffee when we found housekeeping had forgotten to clean our room(!) 6. It's not fancy. If you want fancy or you are really high maintenance, you'll have to spend more money! But it's comfortable and good for folks like us who don't care for cookie-cutter Holiday Inn places.

Located right in the Little Italy district, we were able to park here and walk throughout the shops, parks, and restaurants with ease! The decor of the lobby and lounge/restaurant are really cool, and the rooms are well done. It is an older hotel building, so our room was a bit small, but for the 2 of us (plus our dog - it is Dog-Friendly, which was a HUGE plus for us!) it was all we needed to crash in while out and about. Regarding the room, the furnishings were nice! Artistic wall, flat screen & new furniture. It was small, and our room must have been close to some pipes, because we definitely could hear running water when someone else was using the shower. This was the bit that was annoying - the building is older, so the walls are not as sound insulated as some other places. In fact, one day we got back to the room for a break in the early afternoon and we could here construction (renovation?) that was happening on the ground floor (we were on the 3rd). Part of that is the courtyard openings of the hotel, so it was open to the parking, etc. on the ground floor. Service was good - and they made it easy for a dog to stay with you. The hotel is suited to allow dogs without it being a disturbance to others and easy to navigate the hallways/lobby. Little Italy itself is very dog-friendly, so this was a nice way to vacation. (A flat fee for the dog regardless of how many nights you stay!) There is a park (not dog-park) just to the East of the hotel, so easy to take the dog to do its duty. Little Italy had dog pick up bags all over the place, making it a great stay! I'll review the restaurant - The Glass Door - separately but lets say its worth a trip to the hotel just for the view, and the food was good! Overall, it was a quality hotel...good value for a great location. Walking distance (5-10 min) even to the harbor, the whale watching tours, and USS Midway aircraft carrier.

They all had large windows that could be viewed in to, and each room had an air conditioner that stuck out of the wall next to the door. Even though the carpet was a little worn, the furniture in the room was nice. The bed was very plush and very comfortable, the armoire looked pretty new and was large, and the dresser was good. My only complaints about the furniture were that the television was outdated, and there was a desk right next to the dresser without a chair. So, it was unusable. Overall, the room was just too small for all the furnishings. The bathroom was adequate.

You can put the car away on Friday and not think about it again until late Sunday afternoon when you reluctantly leave. There are dozens of delicious and inviting restaurants within a five to six block radius. There is a row of unique boutiques packed with treasures to explore on Fir, right in front of the hotel. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an English pub, a craft cocktail spot, one of the oldest dive bars in all of San Diego, the beautiful stretch of waterfront for walks/runs, a firehouse museum, cafes with perfectly brewed espresso, gelato shops\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 you get the picture. The creators of Porto Vista know they have a gem of their own and have maximized it with the Glass Door restaurant. That gem is the view. This is my single favorite spot to watch sunset downtown; you are just high enough up to take it all in, feel the breeze, watch the boats, look down on the neighborhood as twilight washes over \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all while sipping your favorite glass of wine or cocktail. Well done PV, the neighbors say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Thank You\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Take heed though, this means you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to compete with the neighbors for seats and if you show up at 5:30 on Friday you will probably not get an outdoor seat. However, there is a huge upper balcony that guests can enjoy. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen pictures of weddings being held up there, so there is almost always room to spread out, even with a group of friends, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll just have to hold off on that glass of wine until you can go back to the bar. The hotel itself is cute in that boutique sort of way. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve definitely got a sense of style and are economic in the distribution of those touches. We got a room on the north side of the fourth floor, complete with balcony. They are spacious with a desk, wet bar, armoire, king bed and an arm chair. The bath was large enough for two to be in comfortably. The carpet, sheets, towels and sundries were what you would expect in a mid-range hotel (think Holiday Inn\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 just with style) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nothing fancy, but clean and suitable for a weekend get-away. Best of all, this is a pet-friendly property and very dog-friendly neighborhood (play park just a couple blocks away) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so your pet can have an exciting holiday with you! I was surprised that the hotel put such a focus on the modern design but left small, old-school tube televisions in the rooms. The front desk was abrupt in their guest communication style, but this may have been a one-off for us. There is a price to pay for this concoction of boutique style, reasonable price and neighborhood placement \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that is the party atmosphere and late-night noise that is common with the groups of younger guests that fill the hotel on weekends. It will bother some more than others, but to me it was a small sacrifice for the long list of positives.

The hotel had, for some unknown reason, overbooked and they didn't have any room and we were then told \"every hotel in San Diego is booked up for the entire weekend\". Not what you want to hear after a long flight...our body clocks were set to it still being the middle of the night. Next, three reception staff fanatically rang round all other hotels only to be told by one they had no rooms...this was all done in front of us! They then found somewhere in the University district of San Diego called the Lafayette. A quick phone call and they seemed to be signing us up without any consultation. I asked the star rating of the hotel to be told \"urm I don't know, let me check\". We were told it was three star the same and that they had a pool - used as a selling point..\"we don't have a pool and it's a historic building\". Did the receptionist/manager not clock that it was evening and we were staying for one night...hardly going to spend time sunning ourselves around the pool!! We had no other choice so accepted. Porto Vista agreed to refund our original money paid along with the price of the room at the Lafayette (or however you spell it). I suppose this was only fair in the circumstances but having booked our California trip in Janauary and were told on the confirmation email that we didnt have to reconfirm, we were left with a bitter taste in our mouths, Not what I expected from American service. the hotel we were sent to was clearly a different standard of hotel and looked shabby around the edges - although the staff in the Lafayette were faultless - much nicer than the Porto Vista. The receptionist as the new hotel seemed bemused by the actions of the Porto vista and told us they had been turfing people out for the last week. porto vista hadn't even rung the new hotel to confirm payment details...we were left with another task on a very weary night, All said and done, it was a badly handled situation and I have lost faith in this hotel and their staff. I would AVOID this hotel at all costs. I know the manager will read this review and highlight that they provided \"good service\". however, I believe there was more they could have done and they could have provided the service they agreed to when I paid in full for the room in January.

This will be our tenth year (2011). I always start looking ahead of time for good rates because this is a popular event and hotels go fast. On July 27, 2010, I found a good rate at the Porta Vista Hotel for 2011 event. My wife and I like the location and used to stay here when it was a Super 8. I remeber that we were a little hesitant about booking because it was nonrefundable, but we went ahead anyway. We booked directly through Porta Vista website and gave our credit card information. On June 23, 2011, I received an e-mail notification of \"Reservation Rate Changes\" and our total cost for staying doubled. I read on the Comic-Con FaceBook page that someone else had issues with their reservation. They stated that after calling and struggling with the Porta Vista, they canceled their reservation. My wife and I decided to cancel since we could not afford the doubled rate. When I called to cancel, I spoke with Anthony and informed him that we were canceling. After looking at our reservation, he hesitated and stated \"Because it was Comic Con\", there was a ten day cancelation policy. We called on day ten. He stated that he would cancel our reservation with no cancelation fees and that they would refund our credit card for the first night, which was charged on our \"Reservation Rate Change\". Why were our rates changed? If our credit card was charged on the \"Reservation Rate Change\", why was it never charged upon making the initial reservation on July 27th, 2010? Also, the \"Reservation Rate Change\" notification stated nothing about a ten day cancelation policy. It clearly states a 48 hour cancelation policy. I will be calling to speak with the manager as to why they did not honor their reservation. Luckily we had a second hotel booked. We almost canceled that the day before, but had forgotten.", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tulsa, Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cLoved it and hopefully we will make it back\u201d", "Author": "dragoon149", "ReviewID": "UR115107180", "Content": "Very nice staff and loved the location.

The price is fantastic for a basic hotel in a great neighborhood with lots to see and do. Given the great location, the price is about the only thing that makes me give three stars instead of two. We stayed in the Midway Suite, which is situated under the restaurant, and they drag the tables across the floor at 11pm and again at 7am. We called the front desk and they were unable to do anything about it. Also the sheets are incredibly itchy and the lack of a fitted bottom sheet makes the beds really uncomfortable. As a result, we chose not to sleep in the hotel, but drove home each night and returned in the morning. The parking fee has gone up to $18 - ouch! And the breakfast vouchers were a good deal when we stayed in February, providing you any entree on the menu. However, when we stayed in June, the voucher just gets you a two-egg breakfast. Similarly, when we signed up for the room block in February, they had a free shuttle to the airport, downtown and Balboa Park. When we arrived in June, shuttle is now $5 per person (cheaper to take a taxi if there are two of you!) and no shuttle to Balboa Park.

I really looked forward to my evening cigar and scotch while taking in the view of downtown, Little Italy, Coronado, the airport, and incoming planes. Rooms: Initially we were in a 'Comfy Queen' room at ground level next to the parking lot, storage, and utility areas. These rooms are small and dark. If we had stayed here the whole week, I would have given this about a 3/5 review instead of the 5/5. I'm not one to complain as you get what you pay for. But a couple of days into are stay, we woke up to dripping water. I ignored it thiking it was the shower. But it was actually a fast leak from the ceiling pouring down into the open toilet, which splashed everywhere on the floor. There was a flap of ceiling plaster that had popped open where the water was pouring from. The excellent customer service mentioned above is what led to a room change into a King-size on the top floor. Beds: In both rooms, the beds were extremely comfortable. I looked forward to sleeping every night. And we needed it after very full days of excursions, sight-seeing, shopping, and eating. Other: -I was surprised to see the work-out room. Nothing fancy, but enough to get my quick work-outs done in the evenings. -The free Wi-Fi service in the rooms is hugely appreciated. This permitted us to plan our days, map destinations, and book excursions. -I like what they've done with the style of the hotel. They've taken an old motel and turned it into something trendy.", "Date": "March 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Goodyear, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cVery pleased...Great location, very comfortable, clean.\u201d", "Author": "goodyearchic", "ReviewID": "UR100766512", "Content": "I was surprised at how quiet the rooms were since it is near the airport.

On Saturday (my first morning at the hotel), the cleaning lady knocked at my door around 9am and asked if I wanted my room serviced. I said no, as I had just woke up. She then asked me if I needed any shampoo/soap or whatever, I declined, and she left. But I didn't think that was it! My room wasn't cleaned at all for the day, since I guess they didn't bother to come back. Seriously - I don't know about other people, but 9am on a Saturday is pretty darn early to be asking someone if they want their room to be serviced. I assume housekeeping just wanted to finish their stuff early for the day or something, but it's pretty unacceptable the way this was done. Granted, it's really not a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but it just irked me that housekeeping would wake someone up early, and then not even bother to show up again. BUT - now that I've vented, there are some great things about this hotel (I swear): +Location: Right in the middle of \"Little Italy\", the location is pretty awesome for San Diego. Close to the waterfront, a 5 minute walk from the trolley (which will get you around town), and of course Little Italy is a pretty neat place in itself +Clean & spacious rooms: Other than the above, the room itself was very clean and well maintained. Clean bedding, very clean washroom and properly dusted/vacuumed. The rooms were very decent sized as well, especially the bathroom which was quite spacious +WiFi/other services: The wireless at the hotel was really strong; it seems like they have a separate network for each floor, which means a stronger signal for guests. In addition, the shuttle service was great as well - the guy who picked me up from the airport was super nice and friendly, and gave some great info/tips on San Diego. Definitely a good way to start off the trip. Unfortunately I didn't get to eat the Porto Vista, but everyone raves about their restaurant, so I think it's definitely worth checking out if you can. +Quiet: Some people mentioned that it was noisy due to the nearby airport. Personally, I didn't hear any excessive noise (and my window was open). A little tip would be to turn on the (very good) fan/AC to get some white noise while you sleep. Some other things to note: -Not a big deal, but the TV sets in the hotel room were really old and fuzzy - it seemed like I was going back in time when I turned on the TV. Granted, I probably only watched 30 minutes during my entire stay, but still something that should be updated ASAP (in my opinion) -The \"motel\" vibe: From the outside, the Porto Vista looks like a \"hotel\". But once you go up the elevator to your floor, you get more of a \"motel\" feel (you can check out my pics to see what I'm talking about). It's not really a big deal, and really had no impact on my stay either way, but just something to keep in mind. -The fifth floor: I stayed on the fifth floor, and it was pretty silent. However, I would point out that they seem to have a pretty large outdoor lounge/sitting area on the 5th floor, so if there's parties or whatever going on there at night, I would imagine it gets pretty loud. I'd suggest getting a room on another floor just in case. Apart from the annoyance with the housekeeping staff, this is a pretty good hotel to pick if you're in San Diego. Great location, nice staff (apart from housekeeping I guess), clean, quiet, and generally a good value (I got an amazing price on bookit.com - $55/night). This isn't a luxury hotel by any means - it's pretty no-frills, with basic amenities. But it does its job and gives you a comfortable place to rest while you're in town. Would definitely recommend this hotel to a friend, but let's just hope housekeeping is a little less \"annoying\" in the future.", "Date": "February 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cNice find\u201d", "Author": "calcoast75", "ReviewID": "UR95629555", "Content": "It's very close to the airport and it had a better price than the comparable hotels in the downtown area.

The second room was much cleaner and didn't smell like it was previously occupied by a chain smoker. The comforter looked new and the sheets smelled much cleaner.

From the looks of the website and the style of the hotel, I was pretty excited about my stay. It is located in a great part of town called Little Italy and it was very accessible to public transportation. I traveled late from LA to SD on a Monday and arrived at about 1 AM. The gentleman at the front desk was very helpful and directed me to my room. I did not book my own room, my company did, and was very grateful for that, until I entered my new space for the next 4 days. I was given a room on the 1st floor where the view out of my window was a parking lot. The room was tiny, the sitting chair was placed in front of the closet cabinet doors (because there was no where else to put it), and the light in my bathroom did not work. Too tired to complain, I went to sleep. The next morning, I let the front desk know about the light and they had fixed it by the time I returned in the afternoon. I spent 3 more nights in this single Queen room. My friend decided to come down and visit for the weekend, so I wanted to extend my stay in San Diego. I went and asked if there were any available rooms, possibly a King, for Friday night. Luckily, there was one available (even though there were 3 wedding parties arriving), and they kindly set me up. I walked back to my little cave and decided to walk right back out and ask if a King was available right then and how much more it was. I found out it was only $15 to upgrade and began my move up to the 5th floor (the highest level). I took the elevator and, as I exited, I caught the end of a beautiful SD sunset on the ocean. The King was nearly twice the size of the queen and I had a balcony with a partial view of the ocean. The next 2 night were soooo much better (although they do need to do an upgrade on their TVs....the one in the queen didn't even have a remote control!). If I had known the size and price difference between a Queen and a King, I would have upgraded to the bigger room sooner! My stay there, all in all, was still enjoyable.

She made some calls and we were handed a key and sent on our way. No explanation of anything or \"Have a nice stay.\" When we found our room after waiting at the elevator for 10 minutes we realized it wasn't the room we reserved. It looked like an upgrade to a suite as it was much larger, but that was the only thing it had going for it. The room was large, but the furniture was mismatched and old looking. The mini fridge under the counter didn't work. All it did was flicker its light and it didn't cool at all. The sink in the \"kitchenette\" wobbled as it wasn't installed properly. The TV was actually a flat screen but it was way too small for the large room. The room was painted a nasty yellow color with gross green carpet. Nothing like the cool blue rooms on the website. There were numbers written on the wall that looked like they tried to scrub off, but didn't care enough to repaint. The bathroom looked like it was remodeled by a child. The tile floor was uneven, the toilet was tightened down so it also wobbled. The sink vanity was crooked on the wall and none of it lined up with the mirror or light. The tilling around the tub was a hack job and the shower was so badly installed that they had to the fill the large cracks between the wall and the surround with caulking. The bed was comfortable but the sheets weren't fitted. They just took one sheet and laid it across the bed. None of the towels matched. Some looked like old used pool towels because they had a blue tint to them. I could have sworn the website mentioned a pool when I reserved but none was found. When we checked in we received tokens for free breakfast during our stay. This was nice since there aren't many breakfast restaurants around. We ate there three days and the food got perpetually better. This isn't much of an accomplishment considering how it started, The first day we ate at 9 and all the food was cold like it had been sitting out all morning. The next day my eggs were at least warm and by the third day it was all warm. The waitress that helped us two of the days was actually very good and friendly. If it hadn't been free I would have complained. The valet prices were a little high but I didn't mind the 14 dollars a day because the parking situation in Little Italy wasn't very good. The valets were some of the best employees at the place so I didn't mind too much. The location is good if you like Italian food. Which we do. The proximity to Little Italy was great. It was just a one block walk to dinner every night and the local cafe. Mimmos and Filippi's were wonderful restaurants. The location close to the harbor, zoo, and Sea World were also pluses as those were the main attractions we wanted to see. The main thing they need to work on is their customer service.

From an aerial view, the hotel is shaped like an open, square box with a separation wall down the middle, thus having two 'atriums' separated and surrounded by rooms on all sides. The lobby is attractive and the desk personnel were professional, personable and, to the extent allowed by the hotel's problems, very helpful. Two elevators are available - one extremely slow and noisy (doors needed lubricated), and the other remote and available only after climbing a flight of stairs (odd?). The hotel offered NO swimming pool, NO hottub, NO refrigerator, NO microwave, NOT even a pen or pad of paper. They took out the pool some time ago and replaced it with a meeting room that remained completely empty during our stay (no tables, no chairs, no anything). The hallways were covered with disgustingly stained carpet (except for the 5th floor concrete hallways) and lined with air conditioning units jutting out into the small hallway about 12 inches and many of these were rusting and in need of paint. The two 'atriums' did NOT overlook attractively landscaped courtyards but badly stained concrete parking areas. Parking was by valet only at a cost of $14 a day unless you wished to park on the busy street with various parking limitations. The Porto Vista is about 3 miles from the renowned San Diego Zoo and the primary reason we stayed here. There is a small rooftop viewing area that allows a nice view of the surroundings as well as the incoming and outgoing airport flights which fly overhead nearby. The beds are comfortable but squeaky, awakening sleepers in the room. The hutch and armoire dominate the small room, standing six feet tall and offering very little horizontal space and they dwarf the 21\" TV. The bathroom was adequate but the ceiling was peeling and rusty in places. Upon arrival, there was a large pool of water on the sink, perhaps from a leaking faucet, and the toilet required that the handle be held down until the full flushing process was complete. Lamps had switches on cords hanging behind furniture (difficult to see or use). The rooms were austere, completely lacking decoration other than the tasteless black-and-white whole wall depiction of a movie star. The room air-conditioner was effective and moderately quiet. Every footstep of the tenant above our room was heard. Cars honked their horns in the 'atrium' outside our door and the blasts echoed and reverberated loudly. Other than the small rooftop viewing area, the remainder of the rooftop was adorned with an open area lined with attractive seating, but all of this was behind a large padlocked gate unavailable to guests except at times undetermined and unmarked (no signs explaining when it was open). The 'Glass Door', the hotel bar overlooking \"Little Italy\" appeared to be nice and the happy hour and dinner menus were adequate. There was NO complimentary breakfast of any sort. I was informed that because I had phoned the hotel directly and made my own reservation, I did NOT 'qualify' for any such consideration. Huh? However, this was conveyed very politely and with an apology (what the management puts their staff through amazes me). Again, the staff were always gracious, what what they have to work with is appalling. Imagine in this day and age, a lodging establishment in a major city with NO pool, NO hottub, No refrigerator, NO microwave, NO complimentary breakfast. Other negatives were the seedy-looking hallways and atriums and bland rooms. We have stayed at hundreds of hotels include the Porto Vista as one of the BOTTOM TWO hotels we've experienced. The ONLY reasons this hotel rates even the one-star is because of location and a great staff. We overheard comments of other guests, especially on the elevator, saying that they felt 'trapped in this dump', because if they left, the 24-hour cancellation policy would require the loss of one night's room cost. We inderstood. In final review, other than the excellent staff and good location, this hotel is of VERY POOR quality and we would NEVER stay here again.

The hotel offered a free airport shuttle for pick up and drop off, breakfast, and complimentary internet. The staff were gracious and courteous at all times, and I was able to check in upon arrival at 9am--a full six hours before the designated check in time. Breakfast was amazing, it was practically gourmet food and included in the room rate. I had rosemary potato frittata and challah french toast, for example. The rooms were cute with the retro murals painted on them, and all the comforts were available such as hairdryers, iron, and multiple reading lamps. It was spotlessly cleaned each day as well. As for the disadvantages, the first would be location. The hotel was a long way away from downtown in my opinion, and not at all close the Gaslamp Quarter. A walk to the harbor boardwalk was a good 20 minutes, and even that had few attractions. There weren't many restaurants that offered food other than Italian food as this area was considered \"Little Italy\" so plan to use taxis often. The free shuttle to nearby attractions was a nice touch and probably saved me $50 in cab fare over the weekend. I took it to the zoo, convention center, and marina and the driver happily picked me up from those places as well. The only problem is, as mentioned above, there is very little near the hotel and many, many people attempt to use the one hotel shuttle which seats seven. If you don't book or reserve a seat the night before, it fills up quickly. And it's often running behind schedule. The day I went to the zoo I waited in the lobby for almost 2 hours for the shuttle because I kept being told that it was five minutes away repeatedly. Then I was told that since I'd waited so long I would be first dropped off, which also ended up being not the case as we dropped other passengers off at the marine base first. So all in all I wasted 2.5 hours in San Diego when a ten minute cab ride ($7) would have gotten me there alot faster. Consider the shuttle a perk--but don't rely on it. It was the only thing I heard complaints about from our crowd. Personally, if I was management I'd consider establishing a second shuttle. So the summary is, fabulous service, excellent breakfast, and comfortable beds and pillows all at half the price of the Gaslamp Quarter.", "Date": "August 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cHas potential but fails at the basics\u201d", "Author": "Nigel1127", "ReviewID": "UR74780574", "Content": "I was really looking forward to the Porto Vista. Their site made it seem like a great place. The problems started at check-in. It was busy, but one of the three front desk attendees was just going through paperwork and not assisting anyone. She was trained at the front desk job because she helped the guy that checked me in. So it's not like she couldn't have helped check folks in. I observed the other two to be rude to the people that they were checking in. Certainly no \"welcome - can I help you\" - lots of eye rolling. Very odd. So my first opinion wasn't great. When it was my turn, they printed out my info and the price on it was not the price that I'd gotten on their own website. I noted that in writing, showed the print-out email from THEM that I'd received, and spoke with another attendant and she said it was fixed. But the next day when I checked out, it was still wrong and another supervisor had to fix it. 5 hours after checking in, a pre-ordered item (offered on their own website) had not arrived in my room so I mentioned it when leaving for dinner. I had the print-out from the website and an email where I had corresponded with the hotel about the item. After trying to get me to do it, the front desk attendants finally said that they'd take care of it while I was out (my suggestion, not their offer to help). Upon returning to my room, it still wasn't there. Finally someone from the bar arrived with the wrong item, saying that they didn't know what I was talking about, asking me to pay double what I was quoted on their website for the wrong thing, and lots more eye-rolling. I think they must teach this at Porto Vista orientation because it runs rampant. The room was a king suite. It was a good size and the bed was very nice - slept well. But otherwise, it was pretty shabby actually - some new and some old stuff. Carpet was very shabby. The bathroom seemed nice at first glance but the toilet was wobbly, the soap dish spun around, and the shower control panel also was loose. Breakfast - very average. The toast was so hard the first time 'round that we banged it on the table when the waitress came by to show her it's rocklike features. Check out time is 11am. The maid knocked and entered at 10am thinking we were already gone. What??? Also, there was NOTHING in the room about the hotel. No info on the restaurant, what else was there, not even a pen. Communication is not the best apparently at the Porto Vista - between employees, between employees and the website, and between employees and their customers. Basically, just an odd stay. Maybe they'll get better, but for now, go elsewhere. I will say, that even though we had to pay $14 for the valet parking, the Valets WERE the most customer oriented of the bunch. They were friendly, fast, and knowledgeable about the area. We got concierge type info from them and NOT the front desk folks. All in all. It should have been MUCH better for the money. Their website seems to boast a much better place than it is. But I might be willing to accept a less than perfect building and furniture if the employees were a little more (no, they need to be MUCH more) customer oriented.", "Date": "August 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cLiars and Thieves\u201d", "Author": "dopo2010", "ReviewID": "UR74665433", "Content": "My party of 6 arrived with confirmation number in hand for 3 deluxe King w/balcony rooms. We had double-checked with the hotel 3 days earlier when we started out by car and the front desk confirmed our reservation. We arrived road weary the first night and were told that they had only one of the rooms we reserved, the other two being the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cozy queen.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \"Cozy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is an understatement. 2 suitcases and 2 men couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t walk around the room. One person would have to stay on the bed to let the other move to and from the bathroom. THERE IS A REASON THE ROOM PICTURE ON THE WEBSITE IS OF THE CORNER OF THE ROOM. We repeatedly asked for a manager and were told none were available in person or by telephone and concessions could not be made with out the approval of a manager. We were concerned that the last arriving couple was not going to be able to fit in such tight conditions as he was 6'4 and 270 and needed a king bed to be comfortable let alone fit his wife. Despite much pleading and complaining about how we had confirmed, we were told they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accommodate. We went to the car and searched another hotel nearby that had kings and went in to cancel the reservation and magically they had a room the third part of our party could have at no additional charge. If we could just be patient and accept the upgrade to a suite, all would be made good in the morning when a manager was available to discuss concessions. The next morning we were made to feel like we were granted the privilege of having our reservations honored but no apology was forthcoming for the terrible room that we had stayed in and for having to wake up extra early to have time to deal with the hotel management. Mr. Johnson, the front desk manager, told us that we would all be comp'd the parking expenditures for the poor customer service we had received and that the third couple would be \"allowed\" to stay in the suite for the remainder of the stay. During the stay the rooms were not well cleaned and refreshed, one room didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get toilet paper restocked and we had to call and get some brought to us. After 3 calls, an extra roll was donated from another room. The extra toilet paper was eventually delivered to the wrong room. The mirrors would fog from the shower and reveal pornographic images left by a previous guest; the refrigerators would not cool anything to below 57 degrees. You could not drink the complimentary coffee in the room because there were no cups in one room and only decaf another. The TV's were a different brand and size in each room, all circa 2000, no flat screens, no digital reception and the color tint function was broken in our room so we watched TV in blue and orange. Breakfast was included with the stay but if you slept past 8am there was no French toast, bacon or sausage. They bill themselves as a \"Hip Hotel near Sea World | Zoo\"...anyone paying attention to anything \"hip\" knows you better have bacon. This all culminated in a phone call from Mr. Johnson to my cell phone after leaving and 80 miles out of town telling us that it turns out since one of our party got the room they wanted, no one would be compensated for that first night and parking charges were added to two of our credit cards. DONT STAY HERE unless you want to pay good money for a renovated broken down motor lodge, right off the loud freeway, directly under the flight path of landing jets to the San Diego airport and the worst customer service.

It is a poorly renovated motor lodge. Cheesy wall-sized photos and colorful banners over the interior parking lot did not create that trendy retro vibe for me.

The night desk person did not have the capacity to make a decision without a manager but was able to find a different room for one of the couples after threatening to take our $1200 elsewhere. The next morning, one of the managers offered to our friend to comp all three room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parking fee at $14 a day for our inconvenience, an offer that we found acceptable. When we checked out, my wife was told that there were no pending charges on our credit card and that a receipt was not necessary. Fine. Later that day our friend received a phone call from the same manager stating that he had changed his mind and that since my wife and I had received the room we had reserved, he was going to charge us for parking after all. The charge showed up on my card today. I attempted to call the general manager but his voicemail box is full and not accepting messages. I have to wonder if it is full of complaints.

I booked through hotelclub.com, and received a pretty good rate for the week. So to begin: The Pros: 1. The hotel is in a great location. Little Italy is the best, the food and environment is great. It's close to the harbor and freeway access. It never took me more than 5 minutes to get anywhere from the freeway. It's close to downtown too, and SeaWorld isn't far either. The location is the best feature of this hotel. 2. The staff is very helpful. I never had a problem asking them for anything. I didn't even know I had breakfast vouchers, but they sure did tell me! The room was cleaned each day, and there was no worry about leaving things in the room. 3. The restaurant. The Glass Door, as it's called, was good. At least the breakfast was (we ate elsewhere during the day, since we were about). It wasn't your typical hotel breakfast of juice/coffee and pastries, it was two eggs, toast, potatoes, and choice of bacon or sausage. Which I thought was nice, since there aren't many places close by for breakfast. I'm sure lunch and dinner were just as good. 4. Did I mention the location? I don't think I'll stay anywhere else but in Little Italy in San Diego. The CONS: 1. The lobby and shared areas are nice. But the actual hallways and rooms have gone through a hasty remodel. If you're really picky, you might not like that. If you're spending a lot of time in your room, you might not like that. I noticed it and we didn't spend much time in the hotel, but I got over it. The room was clean, and that's what's really important. 2. The rooms amenities. We had the basic room (so I can only comment on that) and it didn't have a fridge or microwave. Disappointing considering the amount of food the Italian restaurants nearby like to serve. The tv was pretty old, probably as old as I am(22). The bed was very firm, even for me (i like a firm bed), and the pillows weren't very comfortable. The furniture is good, but the room is small so it can get tight. 3. Valet Parking. $14 a night. It's only a problem because it should be included or at least mentioned when looking for hotels. It's not as expensive as other hotels in downtown, but it is an extra fee that can add up. I didn't mind, because it is convenient, but I think It's a bit excessive since there aren't that many people at the hotel. I strongly believe that it should be included with the fare. Conclusion: I think that for a night, this isn't a bad hotel. If your planning to spend a while hear, I'd suggest not having a car because you really won't need it. You can walk nearly everywhere worth going, and if not the public transportation is very accessible. Would I recommend this hotel? I would if it's your first time in Little Italy and you don't have a car with you. You'd have to be an avid walker. If you want to spend more time here, some people would probably like their upscale rooms, but not me. I'm going to try another hotel in the area, that is just as close and still budget friendly. It's a good hotel, that could use some upgrades and changes that would probably make it a great hotel, i.e. a better tv, better pillows, and a reduced price valet parking.", "Date": "July 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prosser, Washington", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel in a great location.\u201d", "Author": "HR-Dana", "ReviewID": "UR70066794", "Content": "This was a fun hotel with a young energy vibe to it.

'knife and fork' i told him. english was his first language. it took him about 20 minutes to come back with anything. and that was after i had to ask for it AGAIN. i wanted to punch everyone there. pretty much the worst hotel experience i have ever had. but one positive, we were there because my husband was running in the rock n' roll marathon. the hotel is pretty close to the starting line. and they had bananas and fruit and coffee for the racers who were staying there. at 4:00 am. that was nice. but the ONLY nice thing.", "Date": "June 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "COSTA MESA", "Title": "\u201cDO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL\u201d", "Author": "MARYPOPPINS77", "ReviewID": "UR67300663", "Content": "I booked 2 nights for my parents at Porta Vista for a weekend in May 2010 for their Anniversary.

Here is what my parents said: We were apprehensive about parking our car at the hotel because most of the cars were double parked in really tight spots. The valet filled out a ticket noting that we did not have any damage when he originally parked it in valet. We did not use our car the entire weekend. When we checked out of the hotel, and the valet brought the car, we noticed scratches on the front of car and the paint was rubbed off. Before we got in the car, we immediately spoke with the front desk and waited for the General Manager who was not in. Before we left, we filed an incident report with the police. We called Greg, the General Manager seven times and left a message each time. He did not return our calls. We finally got a hold of him on the eighth try, and he said he had to talk to the owner.

High speed wireless internet is also free. The management did a pretty decent job making this feel like more than a motel and added character and charm where they could. Sleep quality is the area where this hotel gets points docked - if you listen hard you can hear the planes flying overhead (it's nearly under the SD Airport's flight path), although our room was fairly well sound proofed.

Location - the best thing about this hotel is the location, right on the doorstep of Little Italy with some great bars and restaurants nearby. I particularly recommend Mimmo's Italian Village, delicious food at great prices, and the inside is modelled to look like an Italian village! The hotel is only a 15-20 minute walk to the Gaslamp Quarter and Horton Plaza, and the area felt very safe at night. Room - When I first arrived at the hotel I was surprised to see that the majority of the rooms overlook a covered (but open air) courtyard in true motel style. The only window looked out into the corridor 'outside', but because the courtyard was covered (roof but no walls) there was hardly any natural light in the room. Because of this it felt slightly dingy, and the bathroom was particularly dark. Despite this the room was spacious, the shower was great, and the coffee making facilities were very much appreciated - please note that the coffee comes in it's own filter, like a big tea bag, so don't think you can't use it because there aren't any filter papers! I did like that the sink was in it's own unit outside the bathroom so that one person could use it while another was in the bathroom, and there was also a hairdryer. Facilities - The Glass Door restaurant and bar was great, it serves a variety of drinks and cocktails and has a fantastic view of the city, both during the night and day. We didn't eat there, but it seemed very popular with diners. We know there was a spa at the hotel, but we didn't have an information pack in our hotel with information about the location or opening times and we didn't get round to trying to find it. The wi-fi didn't work in our room, we had to go down to reception to use it. Staff - The staff were both excellent and miserable, depending who was on duty! Our room key didn't work on three separate occasions which was annoying, and the reception staff didn't seem surprised by this, as if it happens all the time. Local area - San Diego itself is amazing, and I would recommend it to anyone! I particularly enjoyed the Old Town Trolley Tour, which has a stop a 2 minute walk from the hotel, as it was a great way to see Old Town, Horton Plaza, Ferry Embacardo and Coronado all in one day. We weren't planning on going over to Coronado before we did the tour but I'm so glad we did - fantastic views both of the city from the Ferry Embacardo, and of the beach/sea from the bar on the terrace of the Hotel Del Coronado. Overall, this hotel is great if you're on a budget like we were, as the negatives are well worth the low price tag and fantastic views from the restaurant. If however you're looking for somewhere particularly elegant or romantic, then I'd look somewhere else.

Aside from being minutes from the San Diego International Airport, you can easily stroll 4-5 blocks west to the pier and see the many attractions or go one block west to the main strip of Little Italy where you will find pizza heaven @ Filippi's Pizza Grotto. The hotel offered free yoga classes on the roof deck - a very cool little area they host special events at when they're not using it as a yoga shack. The hotel also has a hip restaurant/bar with unbelievable views from the 5th floor balcony. Sunsets from the balcony are gorgeous. CON: Not quite finished room with cheap furnishings. Poorly designed bathroom with no counter space. Pay to park - albeit considerably less than surrounding hotels. And finally - my biggest issue was the sewer vents that are piped right next to the elevators, so every time you get on/off the elevator, you're greeted with the lovely smell of a sewer plant - YUCK!

My girlfriend and I decided to get away for one night, it was a last second decision. We booked a two-room suite with a balcony on their website. We were a little hesitant because of some of the negative reviews we read about, but we decided to give it a chance. We arrived on a Saturday morning and the person working valet was very welcoming, couldn't have been a nicer guy. We went to check-in but the person at the front desk had trouble finding my reservation. This was probably the only sour part of my whole experience. But since I travel a lot, I always bring my confirmation number with me. Once I gave him my the number, he was able to locate my reservation. The person at the front desk said that they have a suite ready for me but if I wanted to wait an hour, I could get a suite on a higher floor which means we'd have a better view of the city/harbor. My girlfriend and I were delighted by the option and agreed to wait. They overheard us talking about where to get lunch in the area and they quickly suggested their restaurant on the 4th floor called The Glass Door. We got there in time for brunch and the food was amazing. It was so good that we ended up going back to the restaurant later that evening for dinner!!! You have to check out the restaurant if you're ever staying at the hotel or in the area. It has great food, great staff, nicely poured drinks and a romatic view. The suite was a little smaller than I expected, but it was plenty of room for two people. The bed was comfortable, the room was clean, the lighting was perfect, the balcony view was great, bathroom was neat and everything just seemed great. One of the best things about Porto is it's location. My girlfriend and I never had to use our car while we were there. Everything we needed was within walking distance. Just right down the street is Little Italy where you can find great Italian food and shops. We went downtown and it only cost us an $8 cab ride. The bottom line is this... The Porto Vista Hotel is a great place to getaway with your boyfriend/girlfriend/husband/wife. It's in a quiet part of the city, but seriously close to a lot of great places. I really don't have any complaints with the hotel. The best gesture they made was pushing my check-out time to a later time TWICE. I called once the night before and they gave me a 12:00pm check-out time. I called again the next morning and asked for an even later time and they pushed it back to 1:00pm. That really said a lot about the staff and how much they're aiming to please their guests. Trust me, take it from me, someone who travels a lot. Most hotels will turn you down if you try suggesting a late check-out twice. I've even burned turned down before the first time I've asked at some places. This place is almost perfect. Only thing holding it back was the size of the suite and it did not have room service, but that's not going to prevent me from ever going back.

I stayed from March 5-8, 2009, and, although I specifically asked for a quiet room on two nights out of three I was awakened and kept awake by a radio the other side of a paper thin wall, left on by uncaring, oafish neighbors who weren't in the room - they'd left a hip-hop station on. (BTW, you'd better be into threesomes cause any \"business\" that might be being attended to in the next room will involve you, like it or not.) I called down to the desk in the wee hours of March 7, and the clerk came and dealt with it. Couldn't get back to sleep,. though, and the next day was ruined. The same thing happened the next night and all they could do about it was move me at 2:00 am from my room - or i could stay with the radio now blaring. (The couple was present in the next room, but apparently passed out and unresponsive.) This was penalizing me for being a good guest and rewarding the bad ones. Very, very poor indeed. Next day: completely ruined. The hotel restaurant is a joke, at least for lunch. On Saturday and Sunday, you can't get any lunch - even a sandwich - only brunch. And not very good brunch, but at quite high prices, at that. It is very small and the staff really doesn't know what service is. Parking by the way is also be a nightmare: it's first come, first served in the very cramped underground spaces. If your lucky enough to get a space, you'd better think a lot about moving your car, since you won't get one later. (Check your car afterword for dents.) Indeed, it appears that the watchword for the staff is \"friendliness\" and that's a good thing. However, being overly friendly is not enough. \"Friendly\" only goes so far to make the guest comfortable and happy - the basic aim of any hotel. The management should take a lesson from successful hotels, get its act together and get its staff to hotel school.

I couldn't find many reviews except recently renovated property, near Little Italy...We took our chances and were pleasantly surprised. The initial feel when you enter the Front Desk is very warm and welcoming, but you can tell it is an old motel that has been renovated. The rooms were \"cosy\" but clean, with nice bedding, fresh sheets and a nice yet small bathroom. The staff were extremely friendly, however, could probably do with a bit more local knowledge although they did have a helpful attitude, as long as you have the patience. Had plenty of free parking - always a plus, and was one street back from Little Italy's fantastic Italian Restaurants. About a 10 minute walk to the water, 20 mins to the Convention Centre but a very beautiful walk none the less so don't let this put you off. As we were there they were just trialling their restaurant for breakfast and lunch and later they were to open for dinner.

Read the review before mine....dated August 17th 2008; http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60750-d650054-Reviews-Porto_Vista_Hotel_Suites-San_Diego_California.html Now read my similar experience. This was the last leg of a 10 day vacation. We spent 2 days at a \"budget\" hotel in Tulare CA (while visiting Sequoia Natonial Park) and then 5 days in Anaheim @ the Sheraton. We were expecting 2 equally fun days in San Diego. All three of our hotel stays were booked on line. No problem at all until we made our way to Porto Vista hotel. This was our last stop on the vacation. It was 8-8-8 and our son turned 8 on this day. We decided to take him to San Diego to see the Air & Space Musuem and also the USS Midway. These people at this hotel seriously tried to put a damper on my son's day. We arrived early to find that our room was not ready yet. We decided to go do some laundry while waiting for our room. I asked where the nearest laundromat was and got a snobby \"IN DOWNTOWN\"??? response from the clerk. We left and found a laundromat (yes they have them DOWNTOWN) and returned a couple of hours later. Our room (just like the previous reviewers) was SMALL. I had a printout with me of our reservation. We had reserved a room for 5, with microwave, refrigerator and a roll out. They put us in a TINY room with 2 beds and NO PLACE to put the roll out. You could barely fit 5 people in this room. There was a desk and table but it was all so cramped. NO refrigerator, NO microwave. My husband went down to the desk and the clerk rudely informed him to \"check his reservations\" and told us that we hadn't reserved a microwave and refrigerator (flat out said it wasn't on our reservations) and that she could put us in a bigger room but charge us more. I was so mad! I called choicehotels customer service and they called the service desk. They basically told customer service another lie and said they put me in a \"upgraded, larger\" room and would be wiling to charge me the same. This made me even more mad. Here they were actually giving me the hotel room I had ordered under the guise of an \"upgrade\". Two men brought in a rollaway, and even being the \"larger\" room, it wouldn't fit. They had to move the table in front of the bathroom door (which blocked the cabinet to the refrigerator and micro and also partially blocked the bathroom door in addition to making the table unusable) and then once the table was moved that made room for the slide out UP AGAINST the a/c. The staff was snotty and arrogant. The hotel was a mess. The a/c's dripped on the carpet. They can't blame this on a remodel. There wasn't even soap in my room. There was some dumb shoe sponge and a shower cap, but no soap. They get a lot of activity here from the downtown party crowd. They cater to those that are there for the nightlife. Parking is insane, because the partygoers take all the hotel guests parking. They give you a parking permit for your car, yet they don't do anything about those that are parked there without a permit. I filed a formal complaint with choicehotels.com. This hotel was advertised as part of \"The Clarion Collection\". 6 days after our trip I received a call from a \"Grace\". She basically said the same thing she told the last guy. She blamed it on the website. She said that they had complained to choicehotels because there rooms were loaded wrong. If that's the case then why do their clerks treat the customer so bad when it turns out there is a SUPPOSED discrepency? She also went on to say that complaining about the website to choicehotels wouldn't do me any good because all the complaints go back to her. She went on to say they like to think of themselves as \"independent\" and seperate themselves from choicehotels intentionally and they are in the process of breaking away into another name...I believe she said ASCENT.....personally, staying here is a downhill experience, it should be called DESCENT. One more thing, she said the rollaways were new and they had noticed they were big (if that's the case they should have been prepared to place a customer that had ordered a rollaway into a room that would fit the) and that they used to use air mattresses and were thinking of going back to them. Once again, they cater to the party crowd. Now I know where the clerks get their snobby attitudes from.", "Date": "August 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riverside, CA", "Title": "\u201cWould Not Recommend\u201d", "Author": "PREPXPRESS", "ReviewID": "UR19057135", "Content": "This hotel is located in a great neighborhood and has very nice initial appearance.

I shopped around for hours for the best deal on a hotel. The day before we left, I decided on Porto Vista based on TripAdvisor reviews, the Clarion website, and other travel sites. I booked the room on the Clarion website. I paid about $140 a night inc. taxes. Websites were unclear regarding parking-some said it was free, some said there was a fee. I called the hotel to find out and was told it is currently free but limited. We arrived at the hotel, which is located north of downtown and just a few blocks from the USS Midway, and greeted by a very friendly staff. I was a little concerned about noise since we were about 2 short blocks east of the train tracks and just south of the airport. Our room was interesting. The far wall was a sliding glass door which was the bathroom door. Thankfully it was frosted glass but provided no privacy-not even on the toilet. It would have been fine for a husband and wife but not great for a family with teens. From what I could tell, there weren't many rooms like that. We were in 555 so judging by the arcitechture, the rooms on each floor below us were the same and possibly on the other side of the hotel as well. Sure they would have moved us if I complained but it wasn't a huge issue. The room ended up being very quite with only an occassional train during the night and planes in the early AM but it was light at night as there was no way to cover the sliding bathroom door and there was a window in the bathroom with no covering. The beds were firm and possibly the most comfortable beds we've slept on. Linens were excellent. The room was fairly clean...my only complaint was the track of the sliding door was sandy and the glass was only clean on the sliding portion. If housekeeping would shut that door while in the bathroom they could clean the track and the glass. It's something many house cleaners make even in their own homes!

Little Italy has beautiful architecture, very friendly people, and of course great food. There is a small neighborhood park right behind the hotel that is awesome. Very family friendly and priceless for our 2 year old. Every Saturday has a street market one block from the hotel--fresh paninis, bread, fruit, etc. Hotel: Still under construction, but nothing too major. Restaurant and jacuzzi are still not open. Construction noise during the day is not too bad, turn on the AC and you can barely hear it. Though my husband was more bothered by it than I was. Elevator: So slow we never used it in 4 days, though it is brand new. Construction workers utilized it so maybe that is why it was so slow. Lobby: Absolutely gorgeous. One small room with one computer for guest use, though I was told the internet wasn't working on it since there were so many people logged on to their wireless. Manager: Extremeley helpful and sincere. Upon check in we were given a room that didn't have a view of the harbor. I asked if there was something available with a view and was immediately given a suite with balcony and view of harbor and the hotel was completely booked. (We checked in around 3:30 pm) Rooms: Get one on the north or west side of the hotel and on the 3rd, 4th, or 5th floor. The west side might only have the more expensive suites, but our room was on the third floor, north side and had a balcony with a view of the harbor and the price was for a queen, 2 people. Since it faced north it also had a view of all of the airplanes landing--our 2 year old LOVED watching them and they are very frequent during the day and almost non existant during the night. The plane noise never bothered us. We were the first guests to stay in our particular room since it was completed so everything was brand new. Windows open for fresh air, refrigerator, wet bar. There were 2 tv's, one in the bedroom and one in the living room--not very many channels to choose from, but if you are in San Diego then chances are you won't be sitting in your room watching tv. Some noise from neighbors was heard, but nothing out of the ordinary for a hotel. Bath and Body Works soaps are very nice too. Note for families with young children--some windows have a low sill and open with only a screen that could easily be pushed out--very dangerous when you are 3-5 floors up. We kept those windows locked. Maid Service: Terrible. We didn't have any for 2 out of our 4 nights. We had to go to the front desk to get towels, etc. Luckily the front desk employees were always very nice and helpful. One day I was in the room and a few minutes after I put up the do not disturb sign I heard the maid cart pass our room. I opened the door and asked if they could just take the trash and give us towels and he said \"no, you had the card up\"....not the best customer service. Shuttle: Terrible. I read previous reviews saying it was great. Not our experience. There was a large convention while we were visiting so the shuttle was available only for them, not other guests. After the convention was over, we wanted a shuttle to the zoo but we were told that it left the hotel at 9 am---the zoo opens at 9 am and if you are not there early you will be waiting in a very long line. We asked if they could make an exception since the shuttle was just sitting there at 830, but nope--it leaves at 9. Funny, just the day before we saw the shuttle give a ride to 3 people to the zoo after they asked at 830. Parking: FREE. Unheard of in San Diego. Overall: Very helpful, nice employees at the front desk and very good manager. Great location. Very family friendly but don't stay here if you are looking for a \"sit by the pool\" type of vacation. The construction is finishing up and they are still ironing out glitches, but if we go back to San Diego, there is no question that this is where we will stay. Remember, get a room on the west or north side on the 3rd, 4th, or 5th floor--the closer to the west side, the better.", "Date": "June 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Crestline, CA", "Title": "\u201cHad a great stay!\u201d", "Author": "ajyacht", "ReviewID": "UR15680727", "Content": "Stayed there after reading a bad review on the first hotel I had booked.

We did not have a \"Comfortable two seat activity table or lounge chair with ottoman\", and neither did our aunt who was also staying at the hotel. She had a room on the 5th floor that was barely large enough for the single bed, but the bathroom was gigantic. Her room did not have a Microwave oven and compact refrigerator. What really sucked about my stay here was on the last day, we called for a luggage cart to be sent up so we could load our car. The hotel only has two very old and used carts that don't match. We were told they were being used by the housekeeping staff. No offer to have the maids bring one down so we could load our car up or have someone help us with all our bags. We were literally the only guests in the hotel except for our aunt, and the parking lot was full of vehicles from the construction crew so we couldn't even pull our truck up close to the elevator. I had to ask if they were going to have someone bring our bags down since they couldn't let us use a cart, and was put on hold for a few minutes while they scrambled around in the lobby. My room was overlooking them and I could see them all talking to each other. I really don't see why they didn't just do what any other hotel would do and let us use the stupid luggage cart. When I did get into the elevator I saw what they were being used for...one of the maids had a big box of Kleenex; she was putting boxes of tissues in all the rooms.

The shuttle van driver was just WONDERFUL, he was waiting for us at the airport and pointed out museums and the best places to eat in Little Italy. He also took us to the zoo and picked us up early when our two little ones were too tired to last any longer. He also ran us out to SeaWorld and after, dropped us off at Denny's to eat! Little Italy is great but not so much so if you have toddlers. We had our 23 month old son and our 3 year old daughter. I asked for a crib for my son and they tossed a pack and play into our room with no sheets. We had a double queen bed room and it was EXTREMELY small but BEAUTIFULLY decorated, and the beds are so comfortable! (we removed the pillow top from ours) The bathroom was so large we parked our huge double stroller in it! Even after my kids took a loooooooooong bath, then my husband a shower, I took a shower and the water stayed hot forever! The bathroom had a sliding glass door so you could pretty much see whatever somebody was doing in the bathroom. It was the type of glass where you can't see details on a person but left nothing to the imagination! The first night we just lay there covered in sweat. We had the a/c pumping on high and all the covers off the beds but it was terrible! Nobody would answer the phone at the super 8 front desk either! Maintenance fixed it the next day, the front desk people acted like they didn't care. The morning \"breakfast' is terrible, just coffee and juice with some stale pastries, no cereal or milk or fruit. All the rooms have refrigerators so if you want basic groceries, make a left out of the hotel and a right on Cedar to the 7-11. Our fridge held a six pack of Bud, gallon of milk, and 2 liter of coke comfortably. To get to Denny's make a right out of the hotel on Columbia St and left on Hawthorn, it's right near the water and there is also a chinese place next door. You could really get by without a car, I wanted the kids to see the beach so we paid the $20 each way cab fare to go out to Mission Beach. Really, it was the perfect couples place with so many bars and restaurants, but we never saw any kids but ours! When I say kids I mean anybody under the age of 25! There was a small park behind the hotel that my kids loved. Oh I should also mention planes fly by every 4-5 minutes and yes you CAN hear them in your room, so light sleepers beware. We brought a fan with us to run all night long. All in all, we were pleased, we paid $129 a night and booked directly through them. They have a lot of construction going on, the Super 8 that they are connected to is a DUMP. (see photo) you have to use Super 8's lobby to check in and get the so called \"breakfast\" Really though, for free shuttle service to and from the airport, zoo, and SeaWorld, plus a beautiful room with a comfy bed you probably can't get a better deal in San Diego. I probably won't stay here again, just because I'd liked to be close to the water. I spent 2 days straight researching hotels before we left and this one worked out all right.
