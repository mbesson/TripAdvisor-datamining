Second, the website implied that internet was free in guest rooms but the only place for free internet was in a lounge, which of course necessitated going down to the lounge which was usually crowded with people loudly skype-ing far-away friends.

The Bad; Location of the hotel is out in the middle of nowhere and I mean NOWHERE, nothing around and it is too far to walk to anywhere of significance.

The Ugly; the room bed/mattress is perhaps the worst I have ever slept on in my life, the hotel is not well insulated and is quite noisy.

The staff at the reception was very friendly and although it was busy they had time to answer our questions patiently. Our hotel rooms was a bit small, but clean as well as the bathroom, however the latter was a bit out dated. Furthermore we could not open the windows (security reasons) and the view was not that great. The biggest problem we had was that the air-conditioning was turned on extremely high, so it was very cold during the night, even we turned of the airco. The breakfast was good with a high variety of bread, meat, fresh fruit and coffee/tea. Also the system that they reserve a certain amount of money on you credit card for food and drinks works really well.

One of the best things, was that as there are so few hotels or in fact other buildings in this area yet, all the taxis we hired to get back from town knew the hotel and where to find it.

These are amenities of much more expensive accommodations. The staff is friendly and very responsive to the minor issues I had at check in. Here's where it gets odd.... \"Please be aware that food from outside is not allowed in the hotel...\" REALLY?!?!?! This rule is actually in the Guest Directory and strictly adhered to by the front desk staff who are watching as you enter the building. Odder still... an empty mini bar that you pre pay in advance to fill with convenient \"packages\" starting at 25 Dhs for the Healthy Pack (fruit basket) to the 130 Dhs Gourmet Pack (2 bottles of wine, 2 candy bars, 2 packs of chips. Here's where it gets bad... the room... nothing special, just a room. Bed, desk, table, tv, water pot, trash can. There is NO carpeting in the room, you get cold tiles from the bathroom to the bed and everyplace in between. There is a 1/4 inch gap under the door causing you to HEAR EVERY conversation, foot step, cough, door open and close along with everything else that's going on outside. You may as well have the door open. Carpeting would help with that some in absorbing the noise also taking the echo and chill out of the room. The bed linen and bath towels could be of a higher quality. I purchased my own as the ones in the room didn't look really clean. There are better places to stay for roughly the same price. Do your research before committing to this hotel. While the hotel itself is above average, the quality of the room isn't at any price. Note to management: carpeting, a flat screen tv with premium cable, and better bed linen and bath towels would turn this establishment into an isolated gem!", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fairfax, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cMy favorite hotel in Dubai\u201d", "Author": "Chigwell-85", "ReviewID": "UR119731513", "Content": "This is my favorite hotel in Dubai. It gives one a sense of space, both in and out. I loved sitting on my balcony with a glass of wine, gazing at the desert. I loved the space of my room with its separate dressing area and wall of closets. The clientele, at least the times I have stayed at the Arabian Park, are mainly business travelers like me. But there are also groups of young athletic types who are starting out on adventures. The three levels of dining work well; one can have a casual burger or sandwich in the cafe by the pool, a gourmet meal in the dining room, or pick up sandwiches, salads, and deserts from the newsagent. I think this hotel would be good for children, as they would pretty much have it to themselves all day, with the business people out on business and the young adventurers out adventure-ing. The pool is never crowded, and that staff are among the friendliest I have known; always ready to help and advise, never intruding. Service is excellent, check in and check out were very fast, and the hotel and its rooms are spotless. If you stay here, spend the [very little] extra for a superior room. I have not seen the standard rooms, although I heard from my colleagues that they are good. The superior rooms are great! The Arabian Park is very affordable. It is nice enough to be a vacation treat, but it leaves one with money left over for all that shopping one has to do. Speaking of which \u2013 ask the hotel about a trip to the Blue Souk in Shahjah. It\u2019s about 30 minutes by taxi, and it\u2019s more fun than you\u2019ll find in the Dubai malls. Yes, the hotel is out of town. But there are always taxis out front, and it's a quick, inexpensive trip into the city. Wafi Mall is about 5 minutes away. I work in Dubai once a year on business and have stayed in several hotels.

The rear rooms overlook a vast empty space, part of which seems to be a building site and no doubt the whole area will be built upon eventually. The rear room which we were given on our second visit was also a little noisy with service vehicles, including waste water tankers, coming and going. The room we were given the first time, overlooking the outside swimming pool had a more pleasant aspect. The rooms were quite basic, but modern and perfectly acceptable.The hotel does offer a free shuttle service to the airport, which is good and also to the Wafi shopping centre, the beach etc. The shuttle times are limited however and in between a taxi is necessary. Be aware that the hotel taxis parked outside the hotel are more than twice as expensive as the local metered taxis. We were charged 26.50 UAE dirhams to the nearest metro station by the hotel taxi, but only 11.50 UAE dirhams coming back by a metered taxi. On our first stay the hot breakfast food selection was cold and not particularly nice. Breakfast was better on our second stay. It was warm but limited in choice. Egg wise, only scrambled is on display, but on our last morning we noticed the waiter bringing an omelette to a customer. Although there is no visible 'egg station', it seems that you can probably ask for boiled or fried eggs, but it would be a good idea for the hotel to advise customers of this.

Arabian Park Hotel ticked all the boxes! I stayed here solo over Easter break and while, yes, it is kinda in the middle of nowhere, it is not bad, as if you hop in the public taxis, it's fine. It's close to the airport too, which is handy. The hotel offers a free shuttle service to and from the hotel - though, the schedule on their website is SO out of date. I had to catch a taxi to the hotel when I first arrived and was told to get in a Pink Ladies cab - which worked out a bit more expensive (around 40-45 dirhams). The shuttle also offers services to a local shopping Mall (called Wafi) - the times are not great (average two hour wait), which isn't bad, but the mall is SO quiet!!! it is like a ghost town! I just went there and used the hotel vouchers to get 30% off the eateries at wafi. But if you didn't want to wait for the shuttle, there are taxis and the hotel is round the corner so wouldn't cost much I'd imagine. Check in was OK, front desk were friendly, but a bit slow in sorting out the paperwork. But they were really busy with lots of people checking in, so it's understandable. I stayed in the executive rooms - they were nice - it didn't look like the photos I saw, but it was fine. It was clean. The pool area is good too, the pool itself is small but it does the job. They have a few sun loungers and the life guards were always friendly and helpful. The hotel isn't far from Dubai Mall - when I caught a taxi from the mall to the hotel it was only about 20 dirhams. I visited Jumeriah Beach on the Monday - heading down there using the hotel shuttle (it is a bit of a trek so I'd definitely take the shuttle) - but note, the beach on Monday's is for women and children only, but men can still catch the shuttle down there. After the beach I had a late lunch at Burj al Arab - getting back to the hotel by catching the train/tube from Mall of Emirates to Dubai Mall (then taxi from the Dubai Mall to the hotel). The hotel staff were generally very friendly and helpful. As a solo traveller I was nervous about going to Dubai by myself, but it was fine! The hotel offered excursions and I signed up to a few and it was a blast!! I went on the day trip to Abu Dhabi - which was good, the price was great, but the places you visit were so so. But at least I can say I've been! I also did the evening desert trip - included sand bashing and dinner, belly dancing at the Desert Gate, a henna lady etc. This trip was also quite reasonable too! On the way back from Hong Kong, I decided to book again at the Arabian Park, just because of the convenience, price and because of my first positive stay there - I knew where everything was, how to get around and what to expect. I stayed here in May 2011 for a further two nights before returning to the UK. The prices are very reasonable, would be even better if shared, but because I travelled on my own it was OK - definitely worth booking an executive room because it includes internet access in the room, free canap\u00e9s every night you stay (although, it's not much, but a nice treat), you also get free drinks (6pm-7pm) and you also get your breakfast and a welcome fruit basket!!

We had done a lot of research before we travelled and was familiar with its location to all the main attractions that a tourist must visit during their stay. Although in a relatatively quiet area of the city it is close enough to all the hotspots and the cheap taxi fares to and from these destinations made it cost effective rather than staying in a more expensive, centrally based hotel. When we arrived we were not disappointed in our decision. Hotel was close to the airport but not TOO close and we were greeted with a warm friendly welcome by the reception staff. We checked into our room for the stay and it had everything we required to make our base to explore Dubai. Beds were clean, ample wardrobe space, t.v and in room tea making facilities made it homely and the view from our room out to the Burj Khalifa in the distance was a welcoming site. Didn't have to worry about transportation, hotel offered a shuttle bus service to various locations on a regular basis and if not serviced by this a taxi was never far away. We travelled to the nearby Wafi Mall and used discount vouchers offered by the hotel in various dining outlets. (Arabian Park hotel is part of the Wafi group so it transpires!) Burj Khalifa and the Dubai Mall was only 10 minutes away together with the plethora of five star hotels which line the Shiek Zayed road. At the end of the day back to the hotel for a sundowner and a splash in the pool, perfect! After making the most of our trip we left our hotel totally satisfied and content with our choice. The staff were really friendly and from our own experiences we can honestly say that for anyone who wants to visit this wonderful city and not spend a bundle on accommodation, this hotel fits the bill. We intend to return next year and do some Wadi Bashing and travel up to the mountains which we have heard are well worth the trip.

I travel to Dubai on business regularly and am due back from the U.K in the next couple of days. In all I stayed at this hotel around 8 times so I feel I can give a honest appraisal judged on all my previous trips collectively. I keep returning to the Arabian Park because it has everything I need, plus more. It's location is perfect for travelling to and from Deira, Wafi City, the International Airport, Jumeira Beach and the iconic Burj Khalifa. Whether its shopping or beaches you want you'll find it all within a short taxi ride. The hotel itself has a cosy bar with ever smiling staff and a separate restuarant offering buffet breakfast, lunch and an evening meal. Quality of food is excellent and service is efficient and courteous. I still to date cannot fault it and I eat/drink there often! A Fitness room is available for those who wish to keep trim and a dunk in the large outdoor swimming pool (great for kids) can be the ideal way to finish a hard day's work/ sightseeing! Rooms are equally satisfying, extremely comfortable beds with plenty of wardrobe space for the long stay traveller. Bathrooms are a fair size with powerful showers to wash under. Hairdryers are standard, together with coffee/tea making facilities, mini fridge and a security safe. In- Room T.V has a variety of local and international channels to choose from, something for everyone can be found by flicking through the remote controls. Also a big plus point, each floor also has a central lobby area which has low tables, comfortable seating and a large plasma screen t.v for the time you want to watch that particular programme in widescreen without venturing too far!! In summary, anyone who is considering going to Dubai for a holiday or for business should seriously consider staying at this hotel. It represents excellent value for money which is welcome and proves you don't have to spend a fortune to get everything you want in this fascinating city.

Yes it is slightly out of the centre but in Dubai you are never close to everything. I stayed here for 4 nights as I needed a cheapish break in the sun. The hotel is not far from the airport, approx 40 dirhams including tip. But the airport taxis charge 20 dirhams even before you go anywhere so that shows you how close it is. The hotel does do a good shuttle service to the airport but it does not pick up from terminal 3 (only 1) although it does drop off there. Hopefully that may change in the future. The hotel was pretty busy but after a couple of hours wait by the pool I was checked in well before the 2pm check in time which was great. My room was very clean and adequate for myself and it had a nice view of the Dubai skyline. I slept really well as the bed was comfy (better than home) There is a lounge area on each floor with free newspapers and a large tv which is really nice and gives a good feel about the place. The free shuttle bus to the beach leaves at 8.30am and 1pm returning at 1.30pm and 5.30pm. It takes about 10-15 mins depending on traffic. I got a taxi back one day and it cost 28 dirhams which is nothing really for a great day at the Jumeriah Beach Park. There are frequent free shuttle buses to the Wafi Mall which is a really nice place and makes a change from the Dubai and Emirates Mall. On check in at the hotel I was given some vouchers for discounts off various places to eat at Wafi and they do come in useful and reduce your bill somewhat. There is also a Carrefour Express just outside the mall where you can stock up on snacks and drinks as although there is a 24 hour snack bar/deli at the hotel there are no shops nearby. I did visit the Dubai Mall (again) and got the hotel taxi which does cost more. But at 25 dirhams to arrive in a posh car it was well worth it and a normal taxi back it cost 15 dirhams plus a tip. So you are quite near to the Dubai mall if you don't fancy the Wafi. I didn't eat at the hotel but the food looked nice and wasn't too expensive and the bar had sport/football on when I passed through so it was a nice place to have a drink and catch up on the results (if you like sport that is). Or you can sit outside by the pool instead which was very relaxing. The hotel was very clean and the staff were very nice and not forced as you sometimes find at other hotels. The only downside was that the pool does not get much sun in the day, only a couple of hours in the morning. But not everyone likes the sun baking on them so for the sun worshippers like me the beach park was not too far away to relax by the sea. Sorry if I have gone on a bit but I was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. I have stayed in a couple of 5* hotels before in Dubai but I couldn't afford to do it again this year so I opted for this hotel and I will most certainly stay there again. If you want to be pampered and chocolates put on your pillow at night then this will not be for you.

I barely had enough room to place my laptop on the table because of the tv and other items. Felt really cramped. The hotel is also really far from Jumeirah (about 30 minutes and 50 Dirhams for the taxi) and about 15-20 minutes from the Dubai Mall (taxi was about 15-20 Dirhams). That was a little inconvenient for me and the hotel charges you 75 Dirhams a day for internet service in your room. The money I thought I was saving was quickly spent on taxis and internet. The tv in your room only gets very basic cable with about 20 channels only 4 of which I actually watched. They do not give out newspapers for each room every morning either.

With that in mind, I went thinking that I should not expect too much. Fortunately, I was very pleasantly surprised. Whilst the outside of the hotel looks a little drab, inside everything appears new. My room was clean and comfortable and had everything I required, tea and coffee included. Very pleasant lounge / tv rooms on every floor ( there is tv in the room also) and service was generally very good. The restaurant food was also of a good standard. This hotel is slightly out of Dubai central, but they do provide a free shuttle bus to Wafi Mall, Jumeirah and Dubai Mall (Burj Khalifa). Also free airport shuttle is available but on a timetable, so if your flight schedule doesn't coincide a taxi is required, which costs around DHS 25 (about \u00a35). As most of my trips to Dubai are short, I would definitely look at staying here again. Because of its location I am not sure if I would stay for more than a couple of days.

Depending on which side your room/balcony faces you might get some great day/night views of the Dubai cityscape. Cleanliness and service were always top notch. My requests for ice (since the mini bar wasn't really providing much refrigeration) from room service were always provided with a smile, and free of charge. One small issue in the bathrooms is the lack of curtain or full size splash guard. The whole bathroom tends to get soaked after a shower. I appreciated the complimentary in-room tea and coffee. However, free internet (in this day and age) really should be a standard service (it wasn't here!) The location of the hotel can be a bit frustrating. Although not far from most destinations in the city, it is slightly isolated. This isn't an issue if you have a car, and taxis are most of the time available at the door. However, your cab driver might find it a tad difficult to get there the first time.

My choice was between here and the Golden Sands Hotel apartments and I kind of wish I had stayed at Golden Sands. I would recommend something else for tourists. I was visiting Dubai on a 5 day break from studying abroad in South Africa so my main purpose was tourism/sight seeing that kind of thing. This is definitely a hotel that caters to the business traveler who can charge all his meals to the company credit card. I didn't buy a single item of food at the hotel despite them having a deli and restaurant because the prices were just rediculous. Roughly $10 US for a pre-made sandwich? I'll pass. They also have a 'no food from outside' policy but I just brought in granola bars in stuff in my backpack to eat for breakfast. The shuttles were nice, but the ones to and from Dubai Museum and Jumeirah beach only run once or twice a day respectively which kind of limits your itinerary if you wanna use that. The hotel itself isn't really in Bur Dubai, its right outside in Jadaf. It was about a ten minute trip into central Bur Dubai depending on traffic and taking the nice modern public bus to the Khalid bin Waleed Metro station was a pretty convenient way to access the city without splurging for cabs every time. Metro closes around 10:30 though so if your planning to go out at night you'll have to get a cab, but they are pretty cheap by western standards. However, when the green metro line opens up in the next year or so this place is going to be really convenient to access the metro. You can see them building the station about a five minute walk away and that will make getting most places you'd want to see in the city pretty easy. The hotel staff were generally friendly, but not really that helpful. The concierge was the absolute worst, he wasn't friendly and frankly he just struck me as really incompetant. They only had city maps in arabic so I asked him to mark down some things for me so I could find them myself and wouldn't do it. He just told me to wait until the next day to take the shuttle to the Dubai museum and then just ask the driver. Thanks for not doing your job. I also booked a desert safari tour on my own and he got kind of pissed off at me that I didn't do it through him (probably because he didn't get a commission that way) and told me that because I didn't do it through him the tour wouldnt come and that I should just go back to my room. The tour people came in the next five minutes. Overall the guy was just unhelpful, incompetant, and kind of rude. Gym was pretty small and half of the one multi function nautilus machine was broken. Internet was pretty expensive. Overall this place I'd think is good for business travelers just in town for a few days as it's in a quiet location and the rooms are comfortable and good for sleeping.

The rooms are a nice size always tidy and well kept and clean it may be basic but has Tv , Fridge and a safe and plenty of space for storage for cloth and suitcases .

The lesiure centre is a small gym thats ok and a sun area with a mid size pool and due to the design of the hotel is a small issue , as the sun moves during the day you can play chase the sun untill around midday then its gone . It then comes back around 4 pm but at the top end of the sun area and that when you everyone in one corner getting the last rays of the day :) Overall if you can find a better 3 star hotel at this price and staff to match then please tell me , plus is only 10 mins from the airport without planes flying over all the time . As i said it does what it says on tin or it's website at the right price for Dubai if you want to pay thought the nose then do so , because how much time do you spend at a hotel if its not on a beach or forgot have a deal to use a very nice 5 star beach hotel for around \u00a340 a day so good deal if you want it .

All in all a reasonable hotel for the price.", "Date": "January 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "india", "Title": "\u201camazin memories of arabian park hotel\u201d", "Author": "titlee", "ReviewID": "UR11981369", "Content": "i stayed here for a month becoz i'd come with office work. amazin environment.

As a whole my impressions are good, it deserves definitely more than 3 stars. Positive points: Firstly, after a tiring long flight the early check-in was greatly appreciated. Rooms are modernly decorated and clean, although not too spacious, not nice area to sit and relax, however not a big problem. A good positive point is the coffee and tea drinks and the daily mineral water supply. Everything is new which is positive point too. Breakfast was very good, not so much variety but it was tasty. Service was very good, staff polite and helpful. Taxis always available from the own taxi park or city taxis dropping clients. There are shuttle buses to airport, beach and nearby mall. Some negative points or recommendations for improvements: Hotel is a little bit isolated, all construction area around but at least not far from city center. Rooms are a little bit cold, even the first room i was placed got freezing me and it took too much time to the staff to discover the room a/c was not working properly and was only cooling. Anyway, i was moved to another room with normal temperature and properly working a/c. The windows of the standard rooms do not open at all, thanx god the air cleaning system was working efficiently. More frequent shuttle bus to beach, and shuttle buses to other malls and city center will make hotel guests more satisfied too.", "Date": "December 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Istanbul", "Title": "\u201cOne of the best\u201d", "Author": "Frappa69", "ReviewID": "UR11879341", "Content": "I am Italian and I came with my wife and my baby (10 month) by tour.

The location is terrible! Ok they have buses to the local shopping centre but if you want a beach it's a long way and only 2 buses to get there each day. As for pool it's constantly in the shade. So if you want to get a glow of gold you'll need to look elsewhere. Decent breakfast, the bar seems smokey shady and no atmosphere. The rooms are really solid - modern but a little souless. We booked a double and got a twin..not the end of the world but it started off badly.

Everyone there was very friendly not matter how busy they were. Here were the negatives: 1. Bus shuttle: didn't show up for either my wife or I. We arrive at different times and were at the right place and the right times but no shuttle? We placed a complaint to the staff. 2. Location: the hotel is far away from the Creek and the famous beach-Jerimiahah ( sp?) The hotel did have some positives: great breakfast buffet, as well as sports bar and deli. Again very friendly staff, good weight room and pool. Mediocre room. Overall had an Ikea like furniture feel. Tips on Dubai: Stay close to the Creek or the beach. Take a desert Safari with any of the numerous companies. Take a hot air balloon ride over the Hata mountains.

It is small compared to many in Dubai and in the middle of nowhere. However it turned out I had no need to worry. The rooms were lovely, though a bit on the small side, the staff extremely pleasant and the free buffet breakfast in the restaurant was extensive. The hotel compensates for being nowhere in particular by providing shuttle bus services every 1 and a half hours to the nearest mall (Wafi and also gives you a 20% discount card for the shops and restaurants there) and this ran until 2am so was perfect for our nights out. There's also regualr shuttle buses to the airport and the beach - all complimentary of course.
