This was our 2nd visit to the city and opted for a slightly out of town hotel - one with amazing views of the city. We were a little nervous about traveling between hotel and the city, but this was not a problem. Although the hotel no longer runs a free shuttle, there is a cheap (2.60euros each way) bus that runs from right outside the hotel. This departs at 20 minute intervals and the journey takes about 20 minutes to plaza catalunya.

I was perfectly aware of this and I know Barcelona pretty well. A lot of people enjoy the location and the view. I had an early walk in the morning to go to visit the Sagrat Cor church and it was perfect. Now the hotel itself. I checked in around 4pm and the receptionist gave me a tour of the hotel. My room (410) had a city view (4th floor and a small balcony). Room was OK but will not consider it as Deluxe. One tip: the beautiful deluxe rooms surrounded with big windows featured on the hotel website are located on the second floor. I'm a Leading Hotel Member and get a welcome gift and a one-category room upgrade (subject to availability) amongst other privileges. I found on the desk a card on a mineral bottle. I opened it and it was a welcome card from the General Manager wishing me a pleasant stay and \"I have the pleasure to present you this bottle of extra virgin oil from our region as an exclusive gift\"... At the beginning I thought it was a joke as there was no olive oil but a bottle of water. Therefore when they deliver my luggage I made the remark and the girl indicated to me that they would bring the bottle of olive oil\u2026 I found that this way of doing this was something strange for a Leading especially when they have my flight details and time of arrival so. Anyway, I took a shower (shower head was had white limestone trace\u2026 and I have to carry out the soap and the shower gel from the sink to the shower\u2026 normally in other hotels of such category they put soap and shower gel in the shower or on the bathtub) Anyway, I only stayed in my room about 1 hour as I was meeting some friends downtown. When I came back at 3am in the morning: No turndown service My wet towels were still there (the towels in the bathroom have not been changed) I had used a glass to take some medicine and it was still on the desk However the olive oil gift has been delivered. My question is: how come the person who came did not notice there was a dirty glass. However, the unbelievable surprise was the mini bar. Attached is a picture!!! Frankly speaking I don't know where they pick up this mini bar but this is just unacceptable for a co-called luxury hotel. Wi-Fi never worked though I mentioned this to the reception as soon as I arrived but nobody really cared. They asked me if I had duly selected the network... I mentioned it again when checking out and I was told, \"It seems that we have a problem our technician is checking\". Breakfast was more than ordinary: the ham and the chorizo were so dried. I really don't know when they have been cut. Bacon was over cooked and the scrambled eggs did not look at all like this. I always enjoy breakfast in Spain as they have a specialty \"Chocolate a la taza\" which is a thick and delicious chocolate. I ordered one and got a kind of ordinary Ovomaltine chocolate. In conclusion the service in this hotel is not up to a Leading Hotel. The only positive thing was the price: 120 Euros a night. But considering that you'll need to take a cab (20 Euros one way) you may reconsider your choice if you really want a top-notch experience.", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent\u201d", "Author": "S R", "ReviewID": "UR125384755", "Content": "I\u00b4ve chosen this place to ask my girlfriend to marry me.

The room (106) was large with a private terrace overlooking the pool and the fantastic views to Barcelona. The bathroom was large as well, with a huge shower and separate bath.

That did not work either. Very unusual way of treating a customer. We decided to have lunch there at their lovely restaurant with truly spectacular views of Barcelona.

We paid 89 euros per night (& booked directly with hotel) and booked a mountain view room 503. The luxury room and facilities totally exceeded our expectations. The swimming pool and jaccuzzi were divine after a day exploring the city. On arrival we were given a glass of fizzy and a tour of the hotel. Our room was large and the bed was comfy and huge. From our window we could see a old style fun fair which was not in operation, I believe it only runs in the main season. It is important to say that the hotel over looks Barcelona and is not central to all of the sights. However you can get the train from catalunya square to the end of the line and then the 111 Tibi bus, which stops virtually outside the hotel. Just ask at the tourist info at catalunya square. We chose a taxi for 15-20 euro as it is a lot quicker and as long as you figure this into the price of your holiday it's so much easier. The staff at hotel are very knowledgeable re transport and getting around the city. A guest at the hotel recommended a restaurant for authentic paella: 7 portes or 7 doors in English ; this was outstanding and not usual yellow rice and prawns, gorgeous. It was 22 euros each so not cheap but worth it. This restaurant is located at the port past the Marina. Just ask it's been around for many years. The old town and the port were my favourite places and a stroll from catalunya ( main square) down la rambles takes you past the old city where the cathedral is and directly to the port.. About a mile. The underground is clean and easy, just purchase 2 euro ticket from the machine to travel anywhere in the city. We loved our stay but the hotel made it for us even though it's in tibidabo outside the city. The peace is amazing. The food outstanding and the best sangria I had during my stay.

The pool and spa area were very enticing and the only downside was the temperature of the outside pool at that time of year - a little chilly but we had fun in our nice and hot jacuzzi upstairs.

The hotel is a short way out of Barcelona itself and the only way to get there and in to Barcelona by public transport is either by taxi or by bus, funicular and train.

There is apparently a shuttle bus from the hotel in to Barcelona but this only runs in the summertime. The other downside is the food. We had buffet breakfast with our package and it was amazing - fruit, cereals, meats and cheese, croissants. there is a restaurant at the hotel for food in the evening and also a bar that serves food. The prices are quite high and unfortunately I can't say if the food was worth it as I am vegetarian - the one vegetarian option on either menu was patatas bravas at the bar. Because of the location, there's no where else to go for food (apart from a cafe by the amusement park) so we brought food in Barcelona itself all the time.

Two weddings on the Friday and the Saturday perhaps also diverted management's attention from the regular guests; and it is always risky when a hotel is running two businesses at the same time!", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barcelona, Spain", "Title": "\u201cPick another Hotel\u201d", "Author": "redfish100", "ReviewID": "UR115400699", "Content": "The hotel has a beautiful view, but that is all.

When we arrived that night, there was a Fashion Show going on. Caught off guard with all the people and excitement buzzing around the front of the hotel, we were told that we can attend the event and eat/drink for free! Our trip started off with a bang. The taxi took about 60 Euro for 4 of us with 7 bags to get to La Florida. - They added additional charges for more bags. Lets start off with the \"likes\" : The Staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel is much smaller than the big chain hotels so they can offer more of their time to the guests. As you arrive they greet each visitor with Cava - very similar to Champagne . The view is great! It really allows you to have a sense of direction of the city before and after you go sightseeing. The rooms were spacious with very nice and big bathrooms. The breakfast is buffet style but they offer quick breakfast near the pool, which is cheaper. we used the quick breakfast every morning and found it very good. It was foggy most mornings when we were there, but still had a good view of the city for the majority of the day. The facility is just as nice as the pictures. The pools are amazing, they also offer a hot tub and the pool bathrooms include steam room and sauna! Now for the \"dislikes\" We had 2 rooms. one with a mountain view - the cheapest room and one with a ocean view. our ocean view had basically the same view as the mountain view. the next day we complained because we were paying more and it wasn't worth it. So they finally moved us to the real ocean view room and it was remarkable. WAY NICER! they were hesitant to switch us to the better room, which is the only reason we didn't love this hotel. So i recommend if buying an ocean view room to ask for the rooms completely facing the ocean. not on the side of the building. or stay on the mountain view towards the front of the hotel. Also, our tv wouldnt allow either of the rooms to order movies because we were already \"checked out\" on the first night. They fixed this the next morning. All in all, we really enjoyed this hotel and would stay here again. I would recommend it to anyone for the view. We took the shuttle into town every day, and took a taxi (19-25 euro) back to the hotel at night. If you want to be close to the city, this is not the place for you. If you want to relax away from the noise and have a romantic stay, this is the place for you at an affordable price. Or if you don't mind staying in town for long periods of time to prevent going up and down the mountain.You cant beat it. I will add a picture of the first \"semi ocean view\" and the \"real ocean view\" sorry i took these really early before the fog was gone.

We came with a baby, who got his own wooden bed, with lovely embrodiert cover; a 5 star bed for a little prince :) The hotel is located in a national park, Collserola, with possibilities of walking and biking.

(we acyually checked with a thermometer, to see if we could take the baby in) -the duvet in the room did not have a proper cover, but rather sheets that were folded over it, so in the morning i found myselfe sleeping on a uncovered duvet. -the staff was really friendly and helpful, but a bit slow, and it seemed that there were lack of people taking charge. -the breakfast was nice, and one could enjoy it on the fantastic patio with a view of the city. Champagne breakfast available. But there were no vegetables at all, witch was a bit dissapointing for salad lovers. In general we really enjoyed our stay, and i can recomend it.

GHLF is a true 5-star property. Service and setting are top-notch. The bed was perhaps the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept on and the bedding, towels, robes, etc. were of the highest quality. Explore the hotel's website; this will show you exactly what you'll be getting for your money. And point of fact, you really do get more than your money's worth here; perhaps because the hotel is not in Barcelona city proper the bang for the buck ratio is extremely high. The irony is, it's the fact that the hotel is \"outside\" the city - above it in fact - which probably accounts for the great deals available. (Just as a guide, pre-booking will get you a rate of 140-euro a night or even less; with my package deal through Sceptre Tours I paid far less than even that!) Our fifth floor room lacked a balcony, but come with three rather than the usual two near floor to ceiling windows. It was quite a large room, especially when considering the marble bathroom had separate rooms for 1) the sink tube, 2) toilet/bidet, and 3) shower. The shower itself offered an adjustable double rainfall-head fixture and while we didn't use the tub, it also offered a shower hose option. Aside from the phenomenal view of Tibidabo Amusement Park and the Temple de Sagrat Cor out our window, each room is equipped with a large wall mounted flat screen TV offering a few channels in English. Each room has a mini-bar fridge with room enough to add your own goodies should you decide to save a few bucks by stocking up on \"snacks.\" GHLF is a spa hotel, but beyond the various professional treatments, the hotel offers all their guests use of the large, heated indoor/outdoor pool and indoor hot tub as well as the locker rooms which off both \"wet\" and \"dry\" saunas and both waterfall and multi-jet massaging showers. We flew home on the afternoon of December 11th, but prior to checking out of the hotel, I was swimming outside that morning! (The setting of the outdoor pool/sunbathing/dining area is simply stunning... overlooking both the entire city of Barcelona and beyond it the Mediterranean Sea.) We had a wonderful lunch at the hotel one day - at the main restaurant (L'Orangerie) and while not light on the pocketbook, the experience is well worth the cost for the romantic \"foodie\" memory. (Again... the service as well as quality of the food was outstanding.) We had snacks and cocktails on evening at the hotel lobby bar (Barca - the idolized local football team was staying at our hotel that night!) one evening and I've gotta say... again... bang for the buck we couldn't complain!) Oh... and something I found especially neat - something that put a smile on my face each night - was that come nightfall, from anywhere in the city you can point to the \"star\" represented by the stunningly lit up Temple de Sagrat Cor at the top of Mount Tibidabo (the spot from which legend states Lucifer took Jesus to survey the world the devil would give him dominion over if only he would grant Satan his allegiance) and tell folks... \"yep... see that light up there... that's where my hotel is!\" So... downside: The only downside - to some - is that GHLF is \"apart\" from Barcelona in terms of exploring the city and the surrounding regional area. Bottom line, you're going to be taking taxis at least part of the time (definitely late at night) at between 11-15 euros a ride. That said, compared to the cost of having a rental car in Barcelona (hotel parking charges, city parking charges... the rental charge itself) we're talking chump change. Plus... the taxi ride \"home\" each night is kinda relaxing... at least we found it to be so. Here's what I'm gonna do folks - I'm gonna map it out for you! Here's the deal: In the summer months all the public transportation options to get up there are open. \"Off season\" your options are more limited. Basically, here's the way to get from \"town\" to the top of Tibidabo where the amusement park, cathedral, and most spectacular views of Barcelona and the Mediterranean can be found: Find your nearest metro stop. Check out the system-wide map. Look for the the FGC S1 and/or S2 lines and if they're not available directly from the metro stop you're at, take the most convenient (other) metro line which will get you to the FGC S1 and/or S2 line. With me so far...??? Basically what's complicated is that while the Barcelona transit system is integrated, its component systems are labeled individually. More on this later... Anyway... continuing... Once you can hop on the FGC S1 or S2 train take this train in the direction of the Peu del Funicula stop and get off there. Get off the train... follow the signs for and proceed to the Funicular - specifically the Vallvidrera Funicular. I know what you're saying... you're saying: \"Bill, what the heck is a funicular...?!?!\" Allow me to explain... A funicular is a cliff railway, a cable railway in which a cable attached to a pair of tram-like vehicles on rails moves them up and down a steep slope; the ascending and descending vehicles counterbalance each other. A funicular is not a cable car. A funicular is not a tram. A funicular is not a subway car. A funicular is... er... a mode of transportation in and of itself. So... anyway... hop on the funicular (which is located at the top of the same structure which serves as the metro stop - it's all the same building; you're never leaving the building!) which will take you up the mountain to Vallvidrera Superior. O.K. Allow me to make this easy for you. The funicular goes up and down. Period. There are no intermediate stops. The lower stop is Vallvidrera \"Minor\" (though they don't label it as such; rather, it simply coincides with the \"Peu del Funicula\" metro stop) while the upper stop is Vallvidrera Superior. (*ROLLING MY EYES*) It is confusing, folks. And to add to the confusion, there are actually two distinct and separate funicular lines both heading up Tibidabo mountain - located some distance apart geographically - with the other funicular line reached via a different FGC line (L7) and involving taking what's known as \"the Blue Tram,\" which runs between the metro station \"Ave. Tibidabo\" and the other funicular! This, however, is the route that's only open regularly during the summer months and other peak times. Just FYI! Oh... and when the amusement park is open... there's also an express bus known as the T-2 which runs between center city's Placa Catalunya metro station and... er... a bus stop adjacent to Gran Hotel La Florida. (Again... the key determining factor on whether this bus exists is whether the park is open or closed; open means bus, closed means no bus.) O.K., now where were we? Oh, yeah... we've now made it up to Vallvidrera Superior via the open and running all year-round Peu del funicular. Exit the funicular. Walk out the funicular station doors and emerge facing the street. Turn to your right - to the cross street; the main avenue - and you'll see a red bus stop sign marked \"Barre Bus 111.\" The Barre 111 bus (a \"local\" minibus) makes its stop there at 20 minute intervals and it will take you on a five minute drive further up the mountain - directly to the amusement park (or alternately to the Gran Hotel La Florida). Got all that...?!?! Seriously... here's all you've gotta know: Off-season, to get from anywhere in Barcelona city proper to the top of Tibidabo and back, you simply need a single metro ticket or a single ride's worth of of a multi-ride ticket. Your ticket will be read by the entry/exit turnstiles you'll pass going on the metro to the funicular to the bus as one uninterrupted ride. The entire trip should take you no more than 40 minutes from city to mountain summit or reverse. FOLKS... if you've made a reservation at GHLF and have never stayed there are are unfamiliar with Barcelona transit, print out the above \"directions\" and bring them to the hotel with you. From the airport it's a 38-euro cab ride to the hotel. Why so much when on the map - as the crow flies - the hotel is only 5 or 6 klicks from the airport and Barcelona taxis are reasonably priced? Simple; because you're not driving as the crow flies! The same applies to the taxi fares from the end of the metro line proper up to the hotel. You're driving up a mountain - not flying in a straight line. Regardless of whether your catching a cab from the FGC F1/F2 line last stop or or the L7 stop, you're still looking at a 10-12 minute taxi ride from the bottom of the mountain to the top of the mountain. Anyway... armed with a print-out of the \"directions\" I've just laid out, you'll be able to get your concierge at the hotel to lay out your various options on a map and further explain to you how the timing and seasonal availability (or non-availability) of public transport works. I know it sounds like a lot, but once you get the hang of it by doing it, it's actually a breeze! Bottom line: The pros far outweigh the cons of staying at Gran Hotel La Florida. I highly recommend this hotel! * Oh! And to wrap up the \"directions\" part of this review, here's another recommendation: You're first full (or near full) day in Barcelona... get a two-day tourist bus pass and on the first day use the tourist bus as a means of \"quick\" initial sightseeing and getting your basic bearings while on the second day utilize the \"hop on, hop off\" feature to really explore Barcelona. The two-day pass is just a few euros more than a single day pass and believe me, combining what your own research has shown you about the city (guidebooks and such) with what the hotel concierge can tell you combined with the tourist bus routes... that will set you up perfectly for getting the most out of your trip to Barcelona. ** Oh... and last but not least... for city metro travel... just get T-10 (ten rides; passes can be shared between multiple users) passes as needed for 7.95 euros a pass. My wife and I averaged going through less than one T-10 pass per day.", "Date": "December 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cEverything was perfect.\u201d", "Author": "blathers", "ReviewID": "UR89315711", "Content": "Very nice place, great views, a real part of dream, good staff and beautiful facilities.

Most of the whining seems to come from people who don't like to spend money on travel. This is a five star hotel, not a two star hotel. Things cost more here plain and simple. If you get a deal on the room through Jetsetter don't expect that those levels of savings will magically transfer elsewhere (good grief!). It's also not smack dab in the center of Barcelona. Don't mark them down for picking a location you didn't think through. The good is beyond good: The service here is attentive and the staff remember who you are, and what your preferences are. It's not American style where they come by and check on you ever 5 minutes which is sometimes rough on Americans. If you're on vacation this should be kind of nice once you get used to it. The food is prepared by people who care about quality of ingredients and taste. Delicious. The location is spectacular. The views are a visual treat as is the property itself. The bar outside is wonderful, the pool and spa are top notch, and L'Organerie is delightful as it comes, and the sommelier is simply brilliant. If you're worried about the shuttle reserve it in advance by calling them. It won't be a problem. The hotel is outside of town and, yes, a cab is going to cost you \u20ac20-30. The last shuttle is at 7:45 at night which is very early by Barcelona standards (the earliest seating at l'Organgerie is 8:30pm). One night we were about 5 mins late for the last shuttle and they waited for us. Well done there. There's also the 111 Barri bus that will take you right outside if you prefer public transport. Apparently take the bus to a cable car which then takes you to the metro and into Barcelona! Things that need improvement: The facial in the spa was wonderful, the massage was average at best. There are no proper massage tables, just a skinny recliner with a hole to poke your face through when you flip over. My arms kept falling off as I would relax. I asked for deep tissue and didn't really get that, neither did my companion. Clearly these very nice people are aestheticians first with a bit of massage training. It was far from horrible but just get a facial and skip the massage. While you can email the front desk replies are a bit spotty. I tried to reserve the shuttle in advance via email and schedule a pick up from the airport (\u20ac80 which is about double the price of a cab but it is a lovely chauffeured high end car). In the end I had to call on the day before departure to make these things happen via phone as a couple of emails went unanswered.

While we didn't have the views of the sea-side terraces (which we could enjoy from the pool anyway) we did get the sun - from breakfast to dinner. Once the pool area lost the sun we'd go back to the room and sit on our loungers until 8.30. No noise at all from the car park or road. It was worth getting the terrace as the restaurant (which is amazing) is basically silver service and night 2 we just wanted to relax (not having wine refilled 1 sip at a time) so ordered room service. Then we decided to get room service breakfast which was a lot nicer than the buffet. I would definitely recommend this as the hotel to finish your barcelona stay - you're too far away to really access the city easily (20\u20ac), but it's great to do the touristy thing then get out of the craziness and seriously relax somewhere special. Never heard a peep from the adventure park next door (although surprised it was there, literally next to the hotel on the hill).

Even a phone call to the hotel didn't do the trick. Finally, my travel agency got the information i needed. This was the first international trip where i arrived in the morning and I didn't have a room ready for me upon check-in. I arrived at the hotel around 1115am and I didn't get to my room until almost 2:30pm. We were told to lounge by the pool for about an hour which turned into several. No complimentary drinks or food once we left reception either. The view of Barcelona from the pool is breathtaking, but the moment is continually interrupted by the screams from people enjoying the thrill rides at the amusement park next door. This is so absurd you have to laugh as people seem to be screaming right over your head. We booked a Terrace Room with a mountain view. From our room there was no mountain view....our Terrace Room overlooked the hotel entrance. Moving was pointless because we were told the hotel was full. We also discovered the door to the adjoining room was unlocked and we could walk into the room next door. Someone from the hotel had to lock the doors. While there was no mountain view from the terrace room we could see bushes, the hotel entrance and the street (see pictures). There was a small architecturally designed waterfall which did a nice job of drowning out the sound of cars and the street, After we were shown to our room, our hostess told us we needed to book the shuttle if we planned to use it to go into the city. The shuttle only runs 4 or 5 times a day, and we found it impossible to book seats. Expect a 20 euro cab ride each way to/from the city centre. Our first morning, several staff members knocked on our door..we discovered our second night that there are do not disturb signs available -- we just didn't have one in our room and we didn't realize we had to ask. We were suppose to stay 5 nights, but the logistics to get to the city, the screams from the amusement park, and the parking lot view were just too much. We checked out after two nights. After checkout, upon reviewing my amex statement, i noticed the hotel charged me for our last day spa use even though we had a 80 euro credit and the spa should have been free. We were also charged for round trip limo even though we only used the limo to get to the hotel from the airport. For a five-star, boutique hotel this place was very disappointing.

We have to agree by saying the views from the hotel are fabulous. Also, our room was very nice - two windows with great views. Hotel is generally very impressive, although a little jaded in parts - e.g. the spa which needs a good coat of paint (mould around the upper window frames - wooden floors which were badly scratched). Yes, the shuttle bus only holds six and is often booked. We found our way round on public transport - first - a bus outside the hotel down to the next village - then take the funicular railway down to the metro - then the metro into the centre (got that!). We quite enjoyed this, but we are mobile and enjoy this sort of thing. However,, the last funicular is at 9.00 pm, so no late nights. The last hotel mini bus also returns at 8.45 pm. This means you must get a taxi, which is approx. 20 euros one way. We did this on the last night, but it would have been costly every night. We didn't have breakfast - we bought our own croissants and fruit from a supermarket in Barcelona centre - no shops or cafes near the hotel - apart from the theme park cafe which wasn't very nice. Breakfast in your room is 32 euros each - coffee is 7 euros per cup. On the last day we stayed around the pool, but felt frustrated because of the cost of the food. It was 21 euros each for a burger - similar prices for sandwiches (this is how we came to walk up to the theme park cafe which was very poor and was only half open). The whole food problem meant that we had to eat our own 'imported' breakfast., get down to the town centre for lunch and then stay there all day - have our evening meal and then do the return - metro, funicular, bus journey. For anyone less mobile I think this would be a problem and would be very tiring. It also means you can't go back midday to change. We knew the hotel was out of town, but it's not 15 minutes away as they state - it was closer to 30 minutes on the mini bus and the public transport route is complicated - which no-one tells you. Our main frustration was due to the fact that we weren't prepared to pay the prices they charge for food. Don't get me wrong, we have been lucky enough to stay in some fabulous hotels in our time - and we're not mean - but we really felt as if they saw us literally as a 'captive' audience.

All reviews about the view are absolutely correct. The hotel's location overlooking Barcelona is spectacular and a wonderful place to have a drink or dinner overlooking the city. But, the location is also a very costly problem. The hotel advertises that is has a free shuttle. However, the shuttle was not available at reasonable times, because it is a van and holds only 4-5 people. It was fully booked at all day times and does not run in the mid-afternoon at all. So, we ended up with a 20 - 30 Euro cab ride each way to and from anything we wanted to do in the city. It's about a 30 minute trip. The room we had was large and had a wonderful view of the sea. However, the television did not work, and it took more than 1 hour to fix it. The maid did not leave soap for the shower and there were no face cloths. The worst part was when I got in the shower, the entire shower apparatus came crashing out of the wall and fell on the floor! The room obviously had not been maintained. Because of the location of the hotel, I had emailed them three days before our arrival asking if they had a car and driver that could pick us up at the cruise terminal. I asked the price and how we would find the driver - with a sign? at a certain location? I never received an email back. No information or quote on the price. I assumed they did not provide the service. So I never confirmed a car and driver with them. When we arrived at the cruise terminal in Barcelona, we disembarked, walked out and got in a cab. There was noone there with a sign with our name or a car and driver for us. When we arrived at the hotel, we mentioned this and the desk clerk said, \"But I sent a driver - I emailed you.\" I said we had never heard from them and never confirmed the pickup as we did not know the cost.\" He said, \" I took it on myself to book the car for you. You must pay for it.\" We said we would not pay as we had not confirmed the pickup and had not gotten a ride. We took a 35 Euro cab instead. He absolutely refused to remove the 90 euro charge from our bill. We will dispute this with our credit card company. In addition, we had booked a package that included buffet breakfast. Because we had to leave before the restaurant opened, the desk clerk said he would have a continental breakfast sent up to our room instead. We thought this a nice gesture. When the breakfast arrived - coffee, juice, pastries - the room service person handed us a bill for 56 Euros. We said breakfast was included - she said, \"not in your room.\" We didn't eat a bite but took the bill down to the front desk. It took 20 minutes to get this straightened out. We had ordered a cab for our departure to the airport. Because it took more than 20 minutes to get the bill straightened out (and yes it still included the car and driver cost), the cab starting fee had climbed to 10 Euros before we even left. The hotel was quite empty. I understand why. There are other great hotels in Barcelona. I recommend staying in one of them.

Also, the rooms didn't have kettles which was a shame as we'd brought tea bags with us (typical british!!). However, we just rang room service every day and they brought up a jug of boiling water. My advice - take a travel kettle! Overall, this was the best hotel i've ever stayed in on a city break. Taxi fares are about 20 euros into the town centre but the hotel runs a free shuttle service down into the city centre which was very convenient and reliable (it's a mercedes people carrier, not a mini bus as the name suggests!)

It is about a 25 euro taxi drive in the centre of Barcelona and although the hotel does have a bus shuttle service, it was always booked when we wanted it, even by calling a couple of days in advance plus, there seemed some significant gaps in the times they departed/returned. There also seems to be a bus (T2) that goes by the hotel from the city centre, so that might be worth looking at, although we didn't try it.

However, you can get coffee and pastries at the bar for a more reasonable 12 euros. As the hotel has 48 rooms, the loungers are at a premium and so unfortunately, you tend to have to resort to placing your towel on them early in the morning before breakfast. The food is OK, but pricey, compared to what is on offer in town. The best lunch was the burger! The salads have a lot of lettuce and not much else and the choice is limited.

Some were excellent, others were moody and seemed to be doing you a favour. Also, the pool bar closes at 1am, which is very early and I know they are probably worried about noise upsetting guests, but this is probably the earliest you'll get back to the hotel after a meal and so having some options for evening drinks is expected in a hotel of this quality. There did appear to be a nightclub downstairs, but it wasn't open while we were there and not sure I wanted that anyway! Overall, a great hotel, which just needs a few tweaks to food, staff & facilities to make it truely excellent.", "Date": "August 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cFantastic hotel\u201d", "Author": "Jwesterk", "ReviewID": "UR36524222", "Content": "The booking service for my job put us in this hotel. At first, we were worried that it was so far away from downtown. However, when we arrived, we didn't want to leave! The service was great from the moment we arrived. We had forgotten to get euros at the airport and my colleague went inside to change some money to pay the taxi. A few minutes later, a lady from the front desk came running out and grabbed our bags and insisted we come in and the hotel would take care of the bill. She went and paid the taxi for us and said they would just add it to our bill. Then, they automatically upgraded us to views overlooking the city. It was just amazing when we went to our rooms. The rooms were absolutely spectacular. We had drinks at the poolside bar and just relaxed on that amazing terrace that overlooks the city. Tibidabo is next door but wasn't a distraction at all. We ate dinner later that night on the terrace and had the nightly barbeque. It is quite a wait as there are only five tables and they don't hurry you out at all. If you're an impatient person, you definitely won't like this but we again just enjoyed the view and wine from the bar. Once we were seated, we were the last customers for the barbeque and they gave us an extra plate and a half of the main entree for free since we had to wait so long. The next day when we had to check out, we waited until the very end because it was so relaxing. I will definitely recommend this to anyone and plan to come back on holiday with my husband.

We didn\u2019t realise it is right next door to a theme park which is screened by a fence but you can still hear screaming kids on the rollercoaster rides. The amusement park is also being extended and there were bulldozers tearing up the ground a few feet from where we were sitting which wasn\u2019t very relaxing. Sadly there were also roadworks on the other side of the hotel at the front, and our room overlooked the entrance so we were woken by diggers and workmen at 8.00am each morning - not very relaxing. But spotlessly clean, huge, comfy beds and perfectly serviceable rooms though without any UK TV - the hotel seems a bit dated in parts: lots of black slate everywhere and dim lighting. Overall the service was patchy and although the shuttle bus was excellent and saved us the huge cost of a taxi into Barcelona each day, you have to book quickly as there are only six seats on each trip and it gets very busy. The hotel is small and there is little outside space for sitting in the evening - it gets quite chilly at night so remember to take something warm to wear! It is also very pricey - we paid 28 euros for a continental breakfast and 15 euros for a gin and tonic which we felt was eye wateringly expensive - and we are used to the prices of hotels like the Anassa in Cyprus, which is truly a 5 star spa hotel.

I'm a world traveler and I've just started to use Tripadvisor for advice when choosing hotels or restaurants. So because so many reviews has helped me...I figured I'd give back! Okay, now on to the review... This hotel was perfectly situated in the clouds of Barcelona. I arrived a few hours early and my room was not quite ready, so the staff (who were very pleasant if I may add) held my luggage and provided me with a complimentary drink while I waited for my room. They gave me a tour of the facility and provided me with information about the hotel as well as the city. I had lunch out on the terrace, and by the time I finished, my room was all set. When I arrived to my room, I was baffled by the breath taking views from the balcony. The room was very clean, the bed was extremely comfortable and the shower and the bath was soothing. The room was so relaxing, that I did not even leave my room the first night...(please be aware that I was very eager to see the city, but the bed wouldn't allow me too)The room service was decent, although expensive. Breakfast for 1(small bowl of fruit, green tea, omelette, pineapple juice, oatmeal, and toast) $50 bucks...no exaggeration!! I also ordered dinner from room service and again it was decent, it was also very late coming up to my room. I ordered the ravioli and ended up having to eat it with no sauce because they brought up sauce with meat, and I specifically asked for a vegetarian sauce. I'm not the type to complain though...I just think it was a communication barrier, but overall, the room service agents were very nice as well as the housekeepers! I didn\u2019t get a chance to take advantage of the pool and spa. Because I was only in Barcelona for a couple days, but I'm sure it was relaxing. I also didn\u2019t utilize the free shuttle, service into the city, because they had specific times when they left and returned to the hotel, so I opted to use the taxi services, so I could go as I pleased (its about 20-25 Euro one way). Some people complained about the drive to and from the city, and about how far the hotel was from everything. I beg to differ...the drive wasn\u2019t bad, it would take me 15-20 minutes to get to the city center, and the taxi ride was pleasant. Taxi drivers were friendly and very conversational. I speak only a little Spanish, but I can understand the language very well, so we had some interesting conversations. Overall, if you\u2019re looking to be in the midst of the hustle and bustle, don\u2019t stay at this hotel. But if you\u2019re trying to relax in a hotel thats situated on top of a hill that boasts beautiful views of the city of Barcelona and want to be treated like a king or queen, I recommend you stay here. Some valuable information: I noticed that I was the only single at this hotel. One might feel out of place if you\u2019re there alone, but again, if you\u2019re like me, and you just want to enjoy life and be treated like royalty, checking in alone will not make you feel out of place.

The service was good overall, the room and bathroom were both beautiful and very comfortable, and he pool area (both indoor and outdoor) is truly superb. That being said, I found that the hotel never got things 100% right. It never pushed its offering to reach true 5 star level: the rooms, despite being very nicely designed, are already showing signs of wear (parquet scratched, holes in the lamp shades, temperature of the water in the shower can be temperamental, some light bulbs not working properly). The same goes for service: it was always polite, but not always friendly or genuine. While I had a very nice time overall, I still cannot say that the hotel has any \"wow\" factor or that you feel particularly \"looked after and pampered\". It seems to me almost as if the hotel staff politely provides the \"minimum required\", but does not really go out of the way to make your stay truly memorable. The location is good for those wanting to have some down time and relax by the pool. For those looking to max out their visiting time in Barcelona, it would probably be better to stay in the city itself. The hotel has a free shuttle at regular intervals, but 1) the timing is not always convenient 2) it takes about 30 minutes to get to/from the city 3) the last shuttle back is at 7:45 p.m. 4) it is nice to be able to come back to hotel in the middle of the day to rest up for a little while, or drop your shopping bags. You could not really do that at La Florida because the hotel is just too far away. 5) the shuttle only accommodates 6 guests, so in high season, you may not get on and would be forced to take a taxi Overall, a very good hotel, but still needs to improve a bit to be truly 5 star.", "Date": "December 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris, France", "Title": "\u201cLocation, location, location\u201d", "Author": "NPWParis", "ReviewID": "UR20804207", "Content": "As other reviewers note, this hotel has fabulous views over Barcelona.

The restaurant produces complicated food in tiny portions with amazingly little flavour for the amount of work that went into it, and at high prices. Service is charming but youthfully inefficient and though the \"service my room\" card hung on the door of my suite all day - on a busy landing, not hidden away in a corridor - the room was only actually serviced at 7 p.m. So, provided you can get a good rate, go for the views - but in that case, why not just go for lunch?

Finally, the restaurant service was poor and quite slow. The second morning, after paying 56 euros for a continental breakfast, we ordered some poached eggs. After 45 minutes we asked our waiter for the eggs again, and she literally said its not my problem, its the kitchen. My wife that worked at the Four Seasons for 5 years tells me that this would have been a suspension or firing of the waitperson. We did get our eggs after 1 hour.

I booked this hotel as a special graduation gift for me and my 18-year-old niece. We were also joined by my friend. The three of us stayed in the charming roof terrace suite, featuring a private sun deck, views of the mountains and sea, and a wonderful bathroom. The rate was $966 Euros per night, per the rates quoted on the site. Things that delighted us: The room was wonderful and exactly as described on the website--large, modern, beautiful. Breathtaking views from the deck. Best ammenities ever--robes, slippers, chocolates, stereo system, L'Occitaine bath products. Free access to WIFI. We liked the semi-remote location on the hill overlooking the city. We had just spent a week in the center of Madrid and it was nice to have several days up in the hills. The staff was gracious, helpful and goodlooking. The young staff was very international with--we spoke to staffers from Spain, Mexico, Germany, Brazil, Venezuela, the United States, and Portugal. Communication was very easy. The shuttle to-and-from the city from the hotel was very convenient. It gave us the freedom we wanted and security that we could get back without hassle. The buffet breakfast was terrific, with a wide variety of fruits, breads, meats, fish, and sweets. Great service in a nice sunny atmosphere. Nice spa treatments--book ahead of time by at least a day if you can so that the hotel may get the right type of spa specialist for you. The pool area bar was wonderful during the day and evening. We sunned, swam, rested, drank and ate there several hours per day. In some ways we wasted the sun-deck in our room. We liked the atmosphere of the pool bar. Things that could have been better: The hotel is very intimate, which means you are really aware of the other people around you. During our stay there were two groups of business people staying at the hotel--a young group of Brits and a group of French representatives from the Dodge motor company. Whenever these groups came to breakfast or the pool bar their phones were ringing or they were powering up computers. This was slightly annoying because they changed the entire atmosphere of the restaurant or bar--seeing them made me think of work, when I was trying to relax on my vacation and not deal with phones and computers. On the day we were leaving, the hotel announced that they were closing the the pool bar area that night for a special event for the Dodge people. I'm glad we were leaving because that would have been annoying. There is no other place to hang out if the pool area is closed.

Sadly the theme park next door, which we were well aware of and thoroughly enjoyed with our son, was a tad noisy. At first the screams of enjoyment were amusing but a whole day of it did get tiresome. Having said that it was only at the weekend and it did all stop at 8pm and didn't start till about midday. The other issue we personally suffered with was a wedding being held in the hotel. The price we paid for having a superb view and terrace was that we were right above the wedding venue. The thud from the music was bad enough ( and this went on till gone 3am) but also the noise from drunken guests who regularly wandered past our room to get to theirs. I'm sure elsewhere in the hotel this was not a big problem but it was for us. So be warned, as delightful as the few rooms are with their terraces, on a Saturday night it is probably better to be elsewhere in the hotel. The other problem we suffered was the inability to get a table in the restaurant. To cut a long story short don't assume anything, book a table before you arrive.

We ended up moving rooms in the end, but ideally I would not want to have done this at 2am! Other issue was when I was having a massage. Normally you get assigned a special massage bed where you can put your head in a specially designed rest. Unfortunately this was not to be so whilst your having a nice relaxing massage, your head is twisted which is not the most comfortable experience for an hour.

La Florida is a great hotel, no doubt about that but they do let their standards slip from time to time and I did witness levels of service that I would usually associate with 3 star hotels. The staff in the bar and restaurant were new and they were badly trained, in general the hotel seemed understaffed and I did witness other guests getting extremely frustrated with the speed of service at the pool bar. Luckily I did not experience this myself as I developed a rapour with the barmen from day one!

You are paying a serious premium for the pleasure of eating and drinking in what must be one of the coolest properties in Europe! We absolutely adored the property- it really is classy and there is a calm chilled out ambience to the place that is hard to imagine. We actually only ended up going out twice in the whole week as we were so relaxed we could not be bothered moving! The pool/spa area is great- very quiet. The thermal suite is poor however- they went for a black interior in the steam rooms and it is not ageing well- it looks dirty even though it is not. This black interior was in keeping wih the general design of the spa but I think the designers got this badly wrong! A more traditional marbel interior would look far better- I have been in dozens of steam rooms in spa's across the world and this one rates at the very bottom! That said everything else is excellent in the Spa, but unfortunately as in other depts. of the hotel they do on ocassion let the standards slip and thats a pity.

But in detail: On the good side were - a prompt doorman service, luggage transfer, personal check-in with a glass of champagne, - guidance to the room with nice introduction to the hotel facilities and history, - upgrade to room no. 501 with Barcelona view and a spacious bath with impressive shower stall, tub and separate toilet, - personal welcome card in room (in my native language), a complimentary bottle of water, fruits and a welcome gift (\"Zen candle stick\"), - very nice and clean spa with indoor-/outdoor pool, - cozy atmosphere in the whole hotel and plenty of staff, - restaurant L'Orangerie with good value for money (solid six course tasting menu for 64,20 Euro), - turn down with additional bottles of complimentary water, - free internet access and many copies of international papers in the lobby. On the other hand there were some negative aspects: - the hotel is located in the nowhere of Barcelona, a complimentary shuttle service runs a few times a day but all seats for all shuttles during my stay were already booked when I checked in (at about 3 pm - the maximum capacity are six seats per shuttle only!), - one finally has to use taxis when going to downtown Barcelona what takes first about 15 minutes until a taxi arrives and furthermore costs about 30 to 40 Euro for a return trip to the city center in total (the taxi drivers bill the arrival as well so you start with an amount of 5 to 6 Euro), - there was no clock in the room - not even in the TV or telephone display - and the staff wasn't able to organize any watch or alarm clock during my stay (I had this unusual experience one night before at Casa Fuster Hotel, they finally provided a clock but failed in other things), - there was no shoehorn or any shoe cleaning item in the room and a shoe shine wasn't done overnight (although I placed my shoes outside the door at about 11pm), - annoying minibar pricing: a Coke (0,2 l) costs 8,56 Euro (!) and you won't find any other shops or foodstores in the neighbourhood, - there was no DVD player available, not even on request, - there was plenty of young staff, very friendly but inefficient (e.g. no help with the clock, not even a response/ the headwaiter at L'Orangerie first showed a half board card which wasn't valid for me, came back with the regular card and after request with a tasting menu offer but didn't know what was included in the tasting menu/ the cutlery wasn't replaced as there were no towells replaced in the spa although there were up to four employees around...)

After reading the reviews I expected La Florida to be a very nice 5* hotel, but it exceeded any expectation I could ever have had. 5* doesn't really hit the mark. From the moment we arrived, the service was impeccable. We arrived late at 11.30pm, pulled up outside reception, and got greeted, with our car keys being taken away, and the car being whisked off to be parked. We got seated in the little private reception area, and they opened a fresh bottle of Cava for us (this is normal for evening arrivals, no special occasion). Check in was smooth, and we had a tour of the hotel before being presented with our 4th floor sea view room, which was on the corner of the building which meant we had 2 balconies facing different sides of the hotel. This hotel is aimed at adults, who like to relax, and who like nice interiors. The rooms are tastefully furnished, and there's a wide choice of rooms available. The swimming pool is a beautiful stainless steel infinity pool which overlooks Barcelona. Unlike a lot of 5* hotels where the bar music extends to a cheesy pianist, La Florida has a low key resident DJ in the bar on Friday & Saturday night (think this may only be in the summer), who played relaxing chilled out tunes all night, similar to chilled Hed Kandi. The dress code in the evening was whatever you wanted to wear. I saw women in slinky long dresses, as well as women in shorts and flip flops. You can either sit at the bar, or at the table seats overlooking the terrace and the lights of Barcelona, or laze around on the sofas (literally laze horizontal) . This hotel felt like a home from home, where anything goes, and you feel like you can really relax if you want to. The food was nice, but fairly expensive for Barcelona. The service was slower than I'd normally expect, even for food that's cooked from scratch, but that's the only negative point that I would have with the hotel (and it's not a big negative, it just stood out from the rest of the hotel which was spot on). We chilled out in the steam rooms, which were very hot! They have a seperate female/male spa section with a hot steam room each, and a dry hot (steam?) room with soothing lights and sounds. You can also reach an inter-connecting shared male/female steam room from both the male and female facilities. The spa has lots of showers and L'occitaine products to shower and moisturise (these are also the standard products in the bathrooms of the hotel) . This is perfect if you check out of the hotel at 12.00 and your flight doesn't go until the evening as you still get full use of the hotel facilities. The gym is small, but fairly well equipped, with the emphasis being on the treadmills (in my experience, the most used equipment in a hotel gym). There are bowls of apples in the gym, reception, and other public areas, so plenty of healthy snacks to munch on throughout the day. They also place caraffes of water with fresh mint or fresh lemon in the public areas so you can help yourself to drinks whenever you want. All in all, there was nothing that we wanted for at this hotel. It is a superior 5* hotel, with facilities that made you feel that you were truly being looked after without the stuffiness of a lot of 5* hotels. We were lucky to pick up a sea view suite at 180 euro a night on a special offer. From looking around, the normal price is a lot more. Whatever the price, this place is worth splashing out on.

Check in was a delight as we sat at a table with our front desk person who made sure we had drinks as we went over the details ,.He then brought us to our room while the bellman brought our bags- very classy. In fact service was exemplary and most attentive throughout our stay. The room at the start was huge on the second floor with floor to ceiling windows with a magnificant sweeping view of Barcelona. The bed was a super comfortable King size. The bathroom was similarly huge with double sinksand a separate bath and shower . The pool was spectacular , located both inside and outside and heated just right for a pleasant swim. There was a multi tiered seating area beneath the pool with all seats facing the panoramic view.(One word of caution-if you arrive at the pool too late most seats are already taken sort of like some of the Caribean resorts we have visited so plan ahead a bit to get a seat) Breakfast was delicious with tons of cheese, bread and meats and the setting most romantic outside overlooking Barcelona. We generealy relaxed poolside for a couple of hours before heading into Barcelona by the free Hotel shuttle. The shuttle did tend to fill up so again if you can plan , you should make a reservation in advance. We usually just took a taxi back whenever we wanted to at around 15 Euros. We decided to return for the second portion of our trip because after exploring Barcelona for most of the day into the early evening we wanted to relax at our oasis. Barcelona is a great city but it is loud and crowded and we just wanted to escape at night . If we were only staying a couple of nights perhaps it would have been better to stay in the center of town , but with a more relaxing 5 days we enjoyed our relaxation time at La Florida and still had plenty of time to visit all the sights.

I said to the General Manager that I just wanted to leave but she informed me we could but would be charged the full room rate, despite the hotel being half full. The hotel is looking a wee bit tired as well-managed to escape after one night and landed up in Hotel Majestic... much better thank you.", "Date": "June 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cyprus", "Title": "\u201cDo not go alone .\u201d", "Author": "okyalos", "ReviewID": "UR7417973", "Content": "I have been there on a business trip.

Please take into notice, that there is nothing(restaurant, mini market), lets say at least 10 km from the hotel. The food is around 70 euro per person, which is somehow expensive.

Seriously! Let me put it to you this way... it is the ONLY hotel that overlooks all of Barcelona. It is romantic and classy, yet modern- has breathtaking views, and they have thought of everything so that you don't have to. Sure it is a trek from city center, costing roughly \u20ac14 for a one way trip... however, if you have the money to spend, and you are looking for something that will take your breath away, then I assure you, La Florida IS the place to be. The hotel itself is beyond amazing. It is 5 stars- and yet it doesn't have that big, overwhelming feel of a five-star hotel. Second, it is unbelievably classy in every sense of the word. Whoever came up with this design - the concept of having a hotel such as this on the top of a mountain overlooking all of Barcelona, and whoever decorated the place, definitely deserve an award. The architecture is top-knotch. Make sure that you reserve a room with a sea view because then you can see all of Barcelona. Also try to get a room with a terrace. Believe me, you WON'T be disappointed. While everyone else is riding the blue tram to get to this height and experience this view for a few hours- you will have it all day and all night long. The indoor/outdoor pool is the kind that kids dream of... you can start off inside, in a HUGE relaxing granite sanctuary and then swim under a glass wall and boom, you are outside! The other great thing is this pool is heated so you can use it in the summer or the winter. And the best thing? It is open until midnight. Some of the best moments I had at this hotel were when I went swimming at 11pm in the freezing cold. I swam outside under the stars and looked over the edge of the pool to see the lights of Barcelona below while the steam rose up and reminded me that it was only 42\u00b0 outside! Even if you do get cold (which you will if you stay in the outdoor area long enough), there is a very, very warm hot tub waiting for you indoors on the other side of the pool. In the summer there is also an indoor/outdoor pool bar that sells refreshments and sunscreens. Aside from the pool, you also have a state-of-the-art gym with a television and lots of cardio machines... also saunas, and a spa where you can have body treatments, facials, nails and hair done. The outdoor pool area also has an enormous sun deck, so you shouldn't have a problem finding a lounge chair for sunbathng. The restaurant, L'Orangerie is also to die for-- just make sure you make reservations as soon as possible (I would recommend when you make the reservation to the hotel). Of course, they do eat later here in Spain so if you are looking for an 8:00 dinner- you might be the only ones eating- so it shouldn't be a problem. Another added amenity, that we didn't even know about until we arrived, is that the Tibidabo amusement park is right next door to the hotel. Don't worry, this isn't a Six Flags or a Disney World enormous amusement park... rather a classy and discreet park that was built on the side of Tibidabo mountain back in the early 1900's. Most of the rides are gentle and not scary at all. They are (what avid amusement park goers would say), rides for \"beginners\". It is a great place for young kids... or really for anyone just looking to experience some relaxed fun on \"fair-type\" rides. However, I will say that because this park was built on the side of a mountain, there is an added feel of excitement on some of the rides... after all, you feel like you are at the height of an airplane when you can't see the ground beneath you! Make sure that you pay the actual entrance fee (\u20ac22)-- don't just buy the tickets (\u20ac11)... the tickets only allow you to use the rides right at the entrance, on the first level, so you will be missing more than 3/4 of the park (the park works its way DOWN the mountain on 6 different levels). In the end, Gran Hotel La Florida is the perfect escape. To be honest, I wouldn't recommend the hotel for anyone who is only in Barcelona for a couple of days and who want to see as much as they can... but if you are there for 5 or more days, I would suggest staying in city center for the first three days (Omm or Hotel Majestic) and getting your sight-seeing out of the way (the tour buses are a great way to get a quick overview)... then move to La Florida to get in your relaxation. In the end, it will probably be the best part of your trip!", "Date": "April 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful location\u201d", "Author": "NinaMontreal", "ReviewID": "UR6731678", "Content": "This is a beautifully desined boutique hotel on top of a hill overlooking Barcellona.

Five minutes later, you arrive at the hotel. An alternative is the complementary hotel shuttle, about 7 times a day to the intersection of the Diagonal and the Gracia, but reservation is necessary.

My first mistake was to book a hotel so far away from the centre (silly me) and the second was to book a place so hugely over priced! I had a lovely room with a nice view of the city, a beautiful bathroom and very nice toiletries. A huge plasma TV which seemed to want to fall off the wall! The whole place was lovely, but too far away. We used the free shuttle bus to get into town, but it finished too early for it to be of use to us in the evening. All in all, we spent at least \u20ac40 per day in taxis including the free shuttle service. At the weekend, it was near impossible to get a seat at the times we wanted, and the return journeys were always full, so book ahead if you want to secure a seat. In the evening we had drinks in the bar, the service was better than I had read much to my relief BUT the prices were frightening! On the first night we ate at the restaurant, the starters were lovely, but the mains was too fussy and too many flavours \u2013 the meal costs us over \u20ac280 for 2 people, no desserts, but 2 expensive riojas (\u20ac125). Needless to say, we didn\u2019t eat there again as it was not worth the money. This hotel is suited to couples who want to get away as the whole place is stunning, with views from the pool and bar \u2013 which incidentally is closed after Sept, so we were very disappointed. The rooms are beautiful and well kitted out with very high ceilings. I loved the place, baulked at the prices and got criticised by my husband for the amount of money and distance we had to go to get decent tapas and some night life!

There were plenty of staff to bring drinks. The only delay seemed to be with food which did take a reasonably long time to arrive but was great when it did. Dinner in the resturant was excellent and not overly priced for the quality. The wine list is long and varied. One of the highlights apart from a massage from Tommy was the Sunday brunch.
