I don't know how the place was before, but the renovations are quite nice. It's better than my previous experiences at Fairfield Inn. Pros: 1) Nice, modern lobby (though simple): Fireplace, seating, free cookies, coffee, ice water. Simple \"market\" of convenience store food and toiletry staples 2) A better continental breakfast: I had low expectations since it's continental breakfast, but they had apples, oranges, bananas, bagels, english muffins, hard boiled eggs, waffle batter and iron, cereals, granola, yogurt, coffee, juices, microwaveable Jimmy Dean breakfast sandwiches, corn dogs (??) and an assortment of spreads\u2014jelly, peanut butter, honey, cream cheese, etc. 3) Clean rooms with modern decor: Admittedly it's all done in my favorite color, green, but the rooms like very modern with simple lines, the beds were comfy, nice bathroom, etc. 4) Free wifi. You have to \"sign in\" but it's free for your entire stay. 5) Nice free toiletries--Pantene shampoo and conditioner, vaseline intensive care lotion, and they replenished it daily. Other notes: It's in the middle of retail/restaurant chain hell, which is great or not great depending on your point of view. There's a Target and a Wal-Mart very close by. We stayed here because it was easy access to head back East; it's a good 20 min from Beale Street. Cons: 1) Chintzy towels. Honestly it didn't fit with what they seemed to be doing overall with the place. 2) The one elevator seemed slow and was crazy hot; there were easily accessible stairs, though, and it's only 3 floors. All in all, it was a nice hotel for the money we paid and I was happy with the experience.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Plattsburgh, New York", "Title": "\u201cCannot believe they are booking anyone here!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "lindadee", "ReviewID": "UR119305990", "Content": "Do not......no matter what sort of 'bargain' rate you get, book here.

This was our second hotel we stayed at and it was a good choice. It is so hard to find hotels when you are not from that area and unsure of where the good neighborhoods are. Upon reading reviews of other hotels downtown Nashville, we decided to stay here. It wasn't a long drive to Graceland, Sun Studios, or Beale Street, but it also inst right next door. Basically We were scared to stay downtown and the short drive was worth it to me. The hotel staff is so nice here. They had Ice Water and Coffee in the lobby and of course they offer breakfast in the morning which helps cut down on some of our expenses. There is a Steak and Shake in the same parking lot as the hotel which stays open late, so that was kind of a bonus!

The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed very clean, but this hotel must have been built on a very low budget. Conversations and other guests' televisions could be heard through the walls. We also heard 6 consecutive \"creeks\" every time somebody walked on the floor above us, which was very frequently, once a minute at least, even after we went to bed at 1am. It kept me awake. Every time there was a knock on a door in our hallway, it sounded just like our door was being knocked on; the walls were that thin. I had a few disappointments regarding breakfast. First of all, there is only one waffle maker. You have to stand in line and wait for each person to make their waffle(s). I made my waffle and then got a cup to get some apple juice, which was out. I found the lady in charge of breakfast and kindly let her know it was out. She went off to get more apple juice and came back and tried for 6+ minutes to connect the spout, and she was putting the container in there backwards in comparison to the other juice containers. I tried to point that out, but she didn't listen. I settled for water and went back to my room. My waffle was stone cold by the time I ate it, because of waiting for her. I went back down there a few minutes later to see if the apple juice was available yet, only to find out that she had put grapefruit juice in there instead where the apple juice should have been. The next morning, I tried the apple juice again, hoping that the problem had been fixed, but nothing came out at all, so I settled for water the second morning as well. Not a bad hotel for the price, considering the indoor pool and hot tub, which was very nice, but too many minor annoyances to want to go back.", "Date": "November 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cOK Place to stay\u201d", "Author": "Shmarla", "ReviewID": "UR73136215", "Content": "We stayed here one night on our way from Texas to Viriginia.

For leisure travelers, you're a bit of a hike from such tourist attractions as Beale Street and Graceland. Still manageable, but not exactly \"handy\". Allow 20-30 minutes during non-rush hour times. However, a huge plus for business and leisure travellers alike is the proximity to a wide variety of shopping venues and the loads of dining options nearby.
