Having stayed in a number of different London Travelodge's (some were not great!) I was not sure what to expect. However this was the BEST travelodge I have ever stayed in in London. It was very clean, tidy and the room was excellent. The room was a decent size bearing in mind it was just for me and on the first floor. The bathroom was spotless and the shower, etc all worked perfectly. The bed was very comfortable. No complaints at all. The hotel is very close to Euston Station so as you might expect there was some noise outside from the buses, etc that passed by, however this didnt affect my stay at all. The beauty of being so close to Euston Station meant that travel to and from this hotel is easy peasy. The location near to the Euston Road means that its ideal for anyone wanting to visit the British Library and other local amenities.

Was it clean? Yes Breakfast? Basic, but really nice bacon, well cooked. Anything else? Not really. I gave up on Travelodge a few years ago in despair at the meagre nature of the offering. I accepted this hotel (work booked it for me) because I'd heard that they'd been upgrading and I assumed that with all the competition, e.g. Premier Inn, that they would have upped their game. How wrong I was. My room was a spartan box. I'm struggling even to describe it. How do you describe nothingness? It gave the impression of a place where they are accustomed to having things stolen so that the default position is to strip everything back to the barest of essentials. A bed but no bedside tables. No proper furniture to speak of, just planks screwed into the wall to make a narrow shelf under the mirror which had to serve as dressing table and shelf, the usual open box with a hanging rail ~ and that was it! The towels were thin and meagre. There was no mat to step out on to from the shower. A two inch sliver of soap was the entire provision in the bathroom. Oh yes, there was a little telly, but I had to lie on my side on the bed to be able to see it. My blind did not block out the light, and the noise from the street was a significant irritant. There were holes ~ yes, holes! two of them ~ in my thin duvet cover. I do hate to whinge, but this was not my best stay in the area. If all you want is close proximity to London Euston station, you might actually consider staying here. It wouldn't entice me. There is a better option just around the other side of the station at MIC. If I'd been on one of their \u00c2\u00a319 deals I'd have considered that I probably got what I'd paid for. But at \u00c2\u00a392 I think they could do better, much better.

It was very handy for groceries for our packed lunches - a Sainsburys and M&S at the station - and there was a great little family friendly pub next door serving food all day. During our stay the weather was extremely hot and it was a disappointment to discover that the air conditioning unit in our room was not working, so we had to leave the window open on both nights to keep cool. As a result ,the noise from the street below was quite loud although it might have been worse if we hadn't have been on the third floor - especially the delivery lorry to the pub right below our window at 8am ! Apart from that, the room was clean, fresh and well stocked wth tea & coffee making facilities, clean towels and bedding and adequately refreshed on our second day. We've used Travelodges before and knew to expect basic but clean accommodation. That's what we got. We did not meet any reception desk staff because we booked online and used the automated check-in.

Check-in - very efficient and easy to use self-service, and the member of staff on duty to assist was very friendly and helpful. No problems.

The bathroom was basic but nicely decorated, with little in the way of extras but the shower was good and there were plenty of towels. The doube-glazing is very efficient at drowning out any potental noise from the very busy Euston Road just outside. There were a few thoughtful touches too - the weather was particularly hot and sticky that day and management had provided a fan in the room to assist the air conditioning! Breakfast - a buffet-style self-service affair that is very efficiently run. There is plenty of variety on display, and both the hot and cold food items were replenished regularly. Plenty of staff meant that there were no long waits for tables to be cleared and cleaned. The breakfast room manager was very on-the-ball and ensured that everything ran smoothly.

The overall strategy is clear - cost reduce everything in sight so that the core offering - a clean, and pleasant roof over your head is at a competitive price. And it is getting harder and harder to find a sub \u00c2\u00a3100 room in a big name chain in this part of London anyway now that the Eurostar comes into St. Pancras - and as Premier Inn seems to be going further upmarket - their Euston branch across the road is now seldom under \u00c2\u00a3110 a night now no matter when you try to book it seems. That just be my bad luck, so don't quote me on that figure! I paid \u00c2\u00a379 per night for three nights and this was the flexible rate - which is still cancel-able with no penalty. You can go cheaper if you go for the Saver, non-refundable, pay upfront rate, but on this occasion it only represented a \u00c2\u00a315 saving and really wasn't worth the risk. Location wise you cannot fault it - literally next door to Euston railway station, and a short 5 minute walk from St Pancras/King's Cross. Camden Town is a 15 minute walk away, and you can get a Tube to pretty much anywhere from Euston anyway. The real advantage it has is that it is one block back from the busy Euston Road, so noise isn't as big a problem as those hotels (the Premier Inn Euston for example) that are right on it. With regard to the room/experience itself - if easyJet or Ryanair did hotels, this would be what they'd look like! So there is no bath, just a shower. There are no complimentary toiletries (save for a tiny carbolic-like bar of soap) You get plastic cups instead of glass tumblers. El Cheapo tea and coffee. The decor is incredibly white and soulless. You have to ask for a second set of towels as they are not given to you automatically. There isn't even a phone to the concierge - which means you have to use your mobile to go via the Travelodge switchboard to phone the hotel from the outside. Wi-fi is chargeable. The bar only sells bottled beverages (at the time of writing they are going a good promotion on Peroni beer - 2 for \u00c2\u00a35 - useful given London pub prices!!). You are also encouraged to use the self-check in machine at the door - which for some reason allocated me a disabled room that I didn't ask for - I had to instead go through two members of staff before I found one that was willing to change it for a standard double. Quite frankly the bar/dining area (down in the basement) is tiny - so I'd imagine that they positively expect most guests not to go for the buffet breakfast, which says a lot for the likely quality of it. But I might be wrong of course.....I can recommend a good greasy spoon cafe on Eversholt Street about 3 minutes walk away! Overall then - a good hotel for the price paid. Yes, there were niggles - but it is perfect for those wanting to go cheap, but not risk getting your fingers burnt with one of the smaller independents in the area or one of those utterly dreadful tourist hotels around the Russell Square area (read my review on The President to see what I mean....). As I say, there is the Premier Inn across the road or the ibis Euston which I'd choose over this place if it was a like for like comparison on price.

He just needed to see the e mail confirmation, and within seconds, I was given a key for a room on the ground floor - a real bonus as I'm a senior citizen and can't walk fast with a travel bag. The room was huge, and I liked the open plan idea... it means there's less chance of leaving essentials behind in drawers. Plenty of tea and coffee supplies, and a great location. As I'd arrived in the middle of all the snow and am not good on my feet, I needed to get a taxi from the door rather than find one outside.

Maybe all the \"unhelpful, grumpy\" staff had been given time off for Christmas, but there was nothing wrong with the staff at all during my stay. The shower in the morning was a little too good, I could have stayed there longer but had to remember to be \"green\" and be as quick as I could. The one drawback.... the air conditioning was turned on full blast - I didn't actually realise this could be turned off until I got back from my concert later that evening - and there was no central heating as there is in other Travelodges, only a fan heater, which had to be plugged in. Though it gave off a decent heat, it meant sitting/standing near it to get warm. Fix the heating, Travelodge management, and you'll have a customer for a long time to come.

Yes, it's convenient for the staion but that is about the only positive I can think of. I arrived and tried to use the automated check in machines ... didn't work. Lady on reception just laughed and said they never work. She told me \"we have a problem with our heating\" ... yeah a quite major problem it turns out - No heating at all. Quite the understatement. Not fully understanding the state of affairs I took up her offer of an extra duvet, rather than being moved to Kings Cross as I was nervous of being in a different part of London than planned. So off I went to my room having been told the extra duvet was on its way. On the way to the room I passed an apparently kicked in portion of plaster board which made me wonder about the place. The room when entered, was ICY cold - not just a little chilly. There was wind coming in from the window despite it being apparently closed. I wish I'd had a thermometer with me, but it seriously felt as cold in the room as it had outside - bear in mind this is in the middle of this really cold spell in the UK (December 6th 2010). I attempted a bit of the old British spirit of coping and laughing in the face of discomfort, and wrapped myself in the duvet, contemplating what to do. I thought perhaps I could cope when the other duvet arrived. But no, after 20 minutes I went to reception to ask about the duvet - I was told it will be there in a minute ... another 30 minutes ... where is my duvet? This time they said he's upstairs he'll be down in a minute ... and when I said but didn't you say that 1/2 an hour ago they protested \"really, he'll be there now\". Yet another 30 minutes and finally what happens? Someone barges into my room ... looks shocked and apologises. He'd been told (only just if you believe him and not reception) to come and TAKE the duvet from my room to give it to a guest in a DIFFERENT room!! At this point, I got rather cross (to put it mildly), packed up what little I had unpacked in the igloo-like room, and stomped off to reception. I can think of one more positive thing about this hotel apart from the location and that is that I didn't have to argue much before they called me a taxi to Kings Cross Travelodge. By now it was midnight. So off I went with a rather surly taxi driver (not black cab) to Kings Cross. Kings Cross Travelodge is not perfect by any means (broken lights, grubby etc) but it had warmth and a bed, so thank goodness for that. They also provided a taxi back to the Euston hotel so I could get my bearings ... but that was only because I demanded it. To summarise, I would DEFINITELY not recommend anyone stay in the Euston Travelodge - they have no heating, don't warn you before you travel and don't properly explain the situation. The hotel is freezing and grubby and not well cared for. This totally spoilt my trip to London. Please avoid this hotel, and avoid my mistake of thinking a chain of budget hotels might not be luxurious but at least they'd have warm beds.

During this time, a refusal to ring the manager and constant attempts to serve other guests while not resolving our fairly major issue was especially annoying. We were told that we had to pay for the rooms a second time before we could check-in. After finally caving in and paying again, we heard other guests saying the heating was off in the hotel. We asked if this was correct ad the clerk confirmed that it was. We also asked for heaters but were informed that they did not have any. This seemed slightly worrying in london's worst winter for over 20 years and below freezing temperatures outside. We took to our twice paid for rooms and shivered the whole night through. In the morning, the breakfast staff threw our 2 day lunch passes in the bin and immediately threw pineapple on top of them, despite there still being another day when we needed them. He smirked when told of this. We reported the cold issue to reception again and were promised that the heating would be fixed soon. We left for the day and felt slightly warmer in the London snow than we had in the rooms the night before. When we returned 7 hours later, the heating wasn't fixed but we were promised portable heaters. We again went out and when we returned to go to turn in for the night, half of our rooms had heaters, the others were like large refrigerators. We again asked for additional heaters or some alternative and were told they would send a repair man. When he arrived, he removed a fuse, replaced it and said it should be ok now. It wasn't and when I reported it again, I was told the repair man had gone now and they couldn't do anything to help.

We stayed in this so called helpful Travel Lodge for four nights this month (Sep) and I was sick of hearing the staff say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sorry about that\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Travel Lodge, just like any other Hotel, is interested in one thing, and one thing only, profit no matter what. I thought you could not get blood out of a stone, but I am sure Travel Lodge knows how. The stay We arrived about one hour before the booking in time. We were told if we book in early we would have to pay an extra \u00c2\u00a310. At first I said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no way\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we will sit here till the booking time of 3pm. Then I realised there was no seating or waiting area, and we could not walk round as we have luggage, so we had to pay the extra \u00c2\u00a310, this was charged even though the room was ready. That was the start. Day Two We went down for the continental breakfast that was \u00c2\u00a35.25 each. We paid then looked at what we could choose. There was empty baskets one basket with left over fruit and brown bread and serials. I asked what should be in the empty baskets and was told that chioce had all gone, I asked then for white bread, again I was told it had all gone. I then asked why I was left with left over\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and not the same choice as everyone else, I was told because others have had too much. I then asked why they took my money knowing there was nothing left they said \"sorry about that\" and I asked for my money back. I was then told they can not give refunds in cash only on a card. When I said I have just paid in cash I was told it does not make any difference. \"Sorry about that\" Day three; We got back from a day out to find our clean towels, or should have been, we opened one out to find a great big brown stain, I will leave that to your own imagination. We herd that saying again \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sorry about that\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The last night. We were in bed when we herd someone trying to get in to the room, I shouted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153what do you want\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ten minutes after the same thing, so I got out of bed opened the door to find no one around. I got back in bed and ten minutes someone tried to get in again. This time I jumped out of bed and opened the door and found two of the staff trying to get in with a key card. When I asked what was the reason I was told according to their system we should have checked out and the room should be vacant, then again came \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sorry about that\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd On our departure we handed in the key card and was asked if all was well so we explained and guess what we were told? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sorry about that\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Even the room we stayed in was hell. The noise was out of this world, the worst you could imagine. The blind would not cover the window to stop people looking in. When the blind was down people could see through the gap straight in to your bed. The toilet seat was loose. I was going to complain, but I just could not risk being told again \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sorry about that\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So in my opinion when you stay at this lodge you do so at your own risk. I have compared this lodge with a homeless person and the aggravation they get. A homeless person could have dirty towels, just like the lodge. A homeless person tries to sleep in the street with lots of noise, just like the lodge. A homeless person will eat scraps for breakfast, just like the lodge. A homeless person will be expected to move on, just like the lodge. The only difference is that the homeless person got for free what we paid a lot of money for. People who say they had a satisfactory stay here are either satisfied with anything or were very, very lucky.

We arrived early evening and used the automatic check in to get our key, this didnt work so then waited for someone to come to reception desk. A girl eventually came and dumped a key on the desk then went off again, so we guessed the location of our room ourselves. Our room was fine for the price we paid we werent expecting great luxury. The room was in the basement and rather muggy so we put the air con on and went out for tea. On return from dinner we got back to the room and it was stifling! The air con, reading 18 degrees was pumping out very hot air. My husband went and managed to find a maintenance chap who agreed that it wasnt safe to sleep in there with two young children so told my husband to report to reception to get a new room. At reception the girl on the desk was extremely unfriendly. When my husband explained the problem she asked why we had put the air con on in the first place (it was summer?) and then just suggested we open the small window. Now bearing in mind we were at traffic level in the heart of london I wasnt keen on this and didnt believe it would make a difference seeing as how the room was scorching. Eventually the girl gave us new rooms as they had run out of family rooms (although the hotel was deadly quiet). So we spent the first night of our family trip with my huysband in one room with our eldest and me in another room with our youngest, with no phones in the room to talk to each other or reception and no tv remote in my room, it wasnt the most amazing night ive had. We didnt appreciate having to lug our luggage and two very sleepy girls around the hotel at way past their bedtime. On our 2nd night they moved us again, this time into a family room with working air con, and aside from the many people on the buses that passed outside being right next to our window (and so either had a very dark room with curtaain perm shut or felt like we were on display at the zoo) the room was fine.

This was a room not on the groundfloor and not facing the street. We had a great nights sleep, yes the view is crap.. but what do you expect? This is not Devon or Cornwall.. and since we asked for a quiet room we basicaly had a view of a \"closed off yard\".. then again I didn't go to london to look out my window, just wanted a good nights sleep come the end of the day, and that's EXACTLY what we got.

And when you think that Euston station is only 4 stops from Embankment (london eye, london bridge and opposite big ben, houses of paliment etc...) it didn't take us more than 10mins to get there on the Northern Line (no changes needed) tube map: http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/standard-tube-map.pdf A GREAT TIP!! Since you have to check-out by 12noon, most people like us will want to explore london for the best part of the day, the last thing you want to do is lugg your bags around... well if you go into Euston station, head towards Boots on the far left (near train station 18) there is a drop off luggage service, you only pay \u00c2\u00a38 per bag for 24hours. We used this service and it was a life line and made our visit to london much more enjoyable. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel so can not comment on this, but with London being london.. we never tend to do so as we prefer to eat at our own comfort without being restricted/confined to eating times or places. If anyone has further questions, feel free to drop me a message. We'll be going back here next time :) Cheers Matt P.S. We went and saw GREASE @ Picadilly Theatre.. WOW WOW WOW.. go and see it is all I can say and it will blow you away. Highly recommended, and again.. it was only 3 stops away (with 1 tube change).. you can't get better than that", "Date": "June 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Harrogate", "Title": "\u201cSparse, no hair dryer in room.

The bedside lights were mobile and gave enough light. There was a good blind on the window, which faced onto other buildings not the busy streets.

I can only assume that the payment was actually for an upgrade to a room that had already been serviced! I do not understand why they would clean an empty room first when they know other rooms are booked. Unless they bank on tired travellers, often with luggage, just paying the upgrade so that they can check in! If this is simply an early check in charge when rooms are already serviced then that is SIMPLY DISGUSTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We came back at 3 and checked in... There were no major issued but I cannot say they were either prompt or that pleasant. Our room was modern, bright and clean enough... although there was a maltezer under the desk that had clearly not been hovered. The bathroom (shower ONLY) was small but adequate and again seemed clean. They only left us 1 towel even though the room was booked for 2 and there was not hand towel either. There was also only a few sheets of toilet roll left which meant we had to go down to ask for MORE! Check out was quick as payment is taken on arrival but I was slightly annoyed that both members of staff on reception were using their mobile phones and carried on when they saw us waiting instead of stopping to serve us!

The hotel is right on the doorstep for Euston, and for Kings Cross the hotel is less than 1 mile away, or 5 mins in a taxi. Euston also has a series of bus stops right outside the hotel and the train station, which can take you anywhere in London you want to go to. Euston also has a tube stop taking you right across the city. Now onto the hotel. From the outside it looks like a standard Travelodge. As it is quite a new building the oustide looks tidy and clean. The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. Nothing is too much trouble for them, the hotel check in takes a few moments and there are lifts to the rooms for disabled guests. There is a cafe in the lower ground level which serves food/drink. We had a family room, which was easily big enough for 2 adults and 2 children. The rooms are nice and clean, very modern decor and flatscreen TV (Although we didn't use it much). The rooms also have air conditioning. The rooms were cleaned every day with fresh towels and linen. The hotel represents excellent value for money, especially on some of the deals that you can get by booking in advance. We use hotels as a place to park ourselves, we don't tend to spend a lot of time in them. For that end, Travelodge rooms are perfect.

Wonderful ensuite, spotlessly clean, with shower over the bath, giving the best of both worlds. Plenty of ice-white fluffy towels. Bed extremely comfortable with immaculate, smooth, white linen. The room was very spacious, I guess about 18ft by 12ft. All that's in it is a 5ft (king size) bed and a seven-foot long sofa, hanging space, shelves, one chair. An air-conditioning unit on the wall has remote control. Everything looked new, in excellent condition. In reception there are three vending machines selling ice creams, cold drinks (a can of Coke is 90p so it's not extortionate) and snacks like pot meals, chocolate bars, crisps, also toothbrushes, headache pills and shower gel. Next to these are two internet terminals. The staff were very helpful when a machine went wrong. If you enjoy a bustling city location this is the perfect place to stay. Our 2nd floor room faced the bus stops in front of Euston and although that means traffic all night the double glazing kept out the noise. There are however a lot of police sirens that can be heard, though they are muffled and so didn't keep us awake. You can get to just about anywhere in London using the many buses that stop right outside, or by Tube at Euston or Euston Square. The 91 bus is particularly useful as it takes you to Oxford Street, Covent Garden and Trafalgar Square.Buy an Oyster card and each journey no matter how far cost you only \u00c2\u00a31. A huge fry up breakfast at the authentically-shabby Double Six cafe (turn right outside hotel, two minutes' walk) is an amazing \u00c2\u00a33.10. It's well-patronised by cabbies and bus and train crew, and if it's full there is another a few doors away. The 66 is open 6.30am to 10pm and serve a substantial plate of dinner for \u00c2\u00a35. Almost opposite is a Marks and Spencer, where you can also get a picnic meal to eat in the room. One evening we picked up hot spit-roast chicken and salad from the Sainsbury Local in Tottenham Court Road (bus 91). There are hot drink making facilities in the room and the staff replenish the tea, coffee, sugar and milk daily. Final morning at 6am we were woken from a deep sleep by the terrifying screeching of the fire alarm -- so loud it made me feel shaky and nauseous. Luckily it was a false alarm but the staff could not switch it off and they did not conduct the drill properly. By 7am we were in the Double-Six eating our breakfast. We paid \u00c2\u00a3100 for four nights (different rates each night) between two people --- it's silly money, really, quite unbelievable: \u00c2\u00a312.50 per night each! I am baffled why anyone would want to stay anywhere else unless they have so much money they don't mind wasting it, or unless they intend to waste their city break sitting in their room. Or maybe they cannot live one day without a trouser press or gym? Why pay more to stay at a smelly hostel, cramped B & B or a grubby hotel with a bathroom in the corridor shared with the great unwashed?

On checkout I confirmed with reception staff that the alarm only sounds in the hallways. Other hotel chains I have stayed at the alarm sounds in the rooms as well. All rooms do have their own fire smoke detector in but this did not even indicate by its flashing lights the hotel alarm was going off. This became obvious by the small amount of stayers mustered in reception. The shower tray was slippy so if you are unsteady on your feet beware. Their is a safe handle but that is it. The flat screen TV has a good selection and includes Film4 and CBEEBIES.

We had to ask for towels,pillows,tea coffee etc and were made to feel uncomfortable each time asking for these, the television remote control took 2 days to arrive even though we were promised it would be 5mins each time we asked, and when it did eventually arrive it didnt work. we received the same attitude from the receptionist, and overall poor service from reception whilst checking out, and will never use this particular branch again.", "Date": "November 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Wales", "Title": "\u201cCheap and cheerful\u201d", "Author": "BeckyLSouthWales", "ReviewID": "UR21426624", "Content": "My two sisters and I stayed in this travel lodge for one night whilst we were visiting London to watch Dirty Dancing in the West End.

It was full for this visit and so i opted for this one as location is virtually identical. It was a weird experience from the off. i arrived at about 8.15 pm and couldn't find anyone to book me in, after about 3 or 4 minutes someone turned up and said that as he was the barman he couldn't take bookings. Eventually someone (the hotel manager?) turned up and we proceeded to jhave a starnge converstaion about what I couldn't have or couldn't do. Can i get a meal? No, we only have a bar. Could I have a wake up call? No, we don't do them. Couldn't you just programme the phone? No, there are no phones. Basically don't expect very much in the ways of basics, never mind extras which at \u00c2\u00a3105 a night was a bit poor I thought. The corridor to my room wouldn't really allow for 2 people to pass with ease and the bedrooms are small. I had a window out onto....another window of some sort which was about 2 feet away (ground floor room). It was clean and very white, it felt like being in an antiseptic bubble. To be fair to the hotel (having explored it's website a bit more), it sells itself as a no frills hotel, however it had less frills than I expected. Breakfast was OK but I had to part with an extra fiver. my recommendation is to head for the Premier Travel Inn across Euston Road if you have the opportunity.", "Date": "October 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nottingham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, great stay, great hotel!\u201d", "Author": "NottinghamLisa", "ReviewID": "UR20827625", "Content": "My friend and I booked a family room back in January of this year, well in advance for our October stay to see a west end show. We got the super saver rate of \u00c2\u00a329 for a family room and actually booked and paid before the hotel had finished being built/renovated. The sign on the front desk when we arrived said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153RATE - \u00c2\u00a3105\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We felt very happy indeed with our \u00c2\u00a315 each bargain! Let me first start by saying that the hotel is a mere two minutes from Euston station/underground and about five minutes from Euston Sq underground. Very convenient indeed and you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to haul your luggage very far. The surrounding area is clean and pleasant \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the hotel is on the opposite corner from a lovely park. Check in was very quick and hassle free. A young gentleman called Kaleem (if I remember rightly), checked us in and was very helpful. We were allocated room 324 and told that the lift on the right was the one which went up to our floor. In the reception area you will find a snack machine (crisps, chocolate, cookies etc as well as toiletries), a drinks machine (Coke, water, etc) and an ice cream machine (Mmmmm, little Ben & Jerry tubs as well as Magnums etc) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all reasonably priced! There is also a coffee machine there. We went up to our room and found we had been allocated one at the front of the hotel. It was very big for London standards and was a little less basic than the Travelodges I have been to before. For a start, there were plenty of towels, sheets, pillows and tea and coffee making things so no need to ask for any additional. They do kit the room out fully to accommodate the 4 guests it can sleep. Everything else was present and correct \u00e2\u20ac\u201c flat screen wall mounted TV, kettle & 4 cups, an area to hang clothes and store shoes/bags etc, a chair and desk with wall mirror that lit up, and the usual Travelodge bed with the headboard that consists of small inbuilt shelves and bendy, adjustable lights as well as controls to the main lights. Being at the front of the hotel and on a very busy road, outside noise was fully expected and inescapable. But my friend and I took earplugs and it was no problem whatsoever. I gave my friend the double bed and tuned the sofa bed into a single bed for me \u00e2\u20ac\u201c using the two other quilts to make it smug and comfy and it worked a treat! Very restful nights sleep indeed for both of us. The bathroom was fab \u00e2\u20ac\u201c everything is still very new so it was shiny, clean and spacious. You get your one tiny bar of complimentary soap so remember to take your own stuff. The water was always hot, the shower pressure good for washing off a busy day out in the city. Breakfast was in the caf\u00c3\u00a9/bar on the lower ground floor. For \u00c2\u00a35.25 my friend and I ate toast, cereal, muffins, croissants\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..drank tea, apple juice and ice cool water. We took our time and watched the news as we had breakfast and we got our monies worth!! The girl working downstairs was lovely and helpful \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just the like rest of the staff, including the guy who checked us out who made sure we had enjoyed our stay and were happy with it. I just want to stress \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this is a Travelodge. Their hotels are based on being basic but clean accommodation and having a comfortable bed and a decent bathroom. All of which is present and correct at Travelodge Euston. Reading some of the negative reviews on here I am not quite sure what people expect as most Travelodges are pretty much the same country wide? All in all, a great stay at a great price in a great area. If you know what to expect there is no reason why you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the very best out of this hotel and take advantage of their advance super saver deals. A few tips for travellers booking to stay for West End shows on The Strand : hop on the underground at Euston and get the central (black) line to Charing cross. From there you have a 5 minute (if that!) walk to the Strand and the Adelphi theatre, the Vaudeville, Savoy etc. There are a bunch of lovely theatre restaurants nearby. We ate at The Salieri which was \u00c2\u00a320 each for main course, desert and coffee and including 12.5% service charge and a decent tip. Great value, fantastic atmosphere and lovely, friendly waiters and owner.

I had booked a family room as originally there were three of us travelling although one person later dropped out. I was very apprehensive after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor but in fact it was fine. Upon arrival I asked for a quiet room at the back on a high floor and was told that all the family rooms are either in the front of the hotel or in the basement. We opted for the basement although, having seen comments about it here, I was rather nervous. Reception staff were pleasant and one woman in particular, who seemed to be in charge, was very anxious that we should be happy with the room and went to inspect it herself before we were given it. The room was a good size, looking out on to a little path which I think is private and part of the hotel property and an apartment building opposite. It had a bed and sofa bed (although my daughter said this was a little on the hard side), flat screen TV, coffee/tea, kettle, etc. and a decent bathroom. It was quiet, with only the occasional very distant siren or rumbling of a train disturbing the peace. As far as I can see, the main difference between this hotel room and a more upmarket one is the lack of mini bar, cable TV and telephone (none of which are particularly important to me) and the furnishings being more basic than in, say, a 4 star. Everything was clean and fresh, the room was cleaned every morning and fresh towels and coffee, etc. were provided. All staff members with whom we had any contact were friendly and polite. This is clearly a budget option - but a very pleasant one. Would I stay again? Yes, if I could get the Saver rate.
