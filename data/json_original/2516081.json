We had a king sized bed which came with three very small pillows.

We decided not to rent a car for the week, partly because of the $20 daily parking fee at the hotel and partly because we would not be doing any extracirricular activities. Due to construction in the lobby, the normal in and out of the hotel was somewhat inconvenient. Check-in was a makeshift lobby just off the garage. Then you walk down one flight of stairs to another \"lobby\" where you catch the elevator to your floor. The staff was extremely helpful to us - each time my wife and I arrived or departed, they sent a driver with a golf cart to the lower lobby to bring us to the upper lobby. They also provided a wheelchair so my wife could more easily get from the elevator to our room. Since we had opted not to rent a car, we needed a taxi to the hospital each day for three days. The hotel staff referred us to a limo service (Turbo Limos - Mr. Harry Kim)that took us back and forth for less than the cost of a taxi (confimed, as we did use a taxi once). Harry also drove us to the airport to go home for a lower price than we had paid another limo the day we arrived. I highly recommend the limo service. The location is good as far as being on a main artery. If you don't have your own transportation, it is not so hot for stuff nearby (i.e. restaurants).

The rooms were quite roomy (by Asian standards) but the bathroom was a little small - however, the room amenities were top-notch, very clean, well decorated (and I think the rooms had just been renovated - if they weren't, then the hotel really has a very very good maintenance team!) The Marriott have a digital entertainment system that has pretty much everything to keep you occupied for at least 4 weeks inside the hotel - so check out their PPV movies, music and more if you plan to be in your rooms to chill out/relax (business travelers take note!). There was a small but adequate gym on the breakfast level (located on the terrace) - please make sure to bring your own bottled water if you want to drink while working out. No multi-weights machine but there is a cross/step trainer, treadmill and sitting bike machine and free weights. Breakfast was not included in our room rate - but it was also very substantial. Breakfast buffet offering (with a wonderful little automated waffle maker) gave you \"eggs-made-your-way\" option so a great way to start your long touring day schedule! In hotel ministore is really for \"can't-be-fussed-to-leave-property-to-buy-beer-and-snacks\" situation. Do come prepared. Overall a wonderful property with very friendly, efficient staff all-around!
