Our room was large, spotless, and very nicely furnished. The air conditioning system is controlled in the room directly, and provided a welcome respite from the heat and humidity of Istanbul. Breakfasts at the Homes Suites are a joy. There are plenty of choices for everyone, including a selection of Turkish olives, meats, cheeses, and breads. More typical European fare is also available including eggs, toast, and cereals. The breakfast room is open and light, and is staffed by people who will greet you with a big smile and an eager willingness to help you discover some of Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taste treats. The hotel staff deserves special mention. Everyone at the front desk is knowledgeable and very helpful not only in arranging tours and airport transfers, but in recommending restaurants and making the necessary restaurant reservations. Whenever we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d leave the hotel by taxi, either Saleh or Murat (two exceptionally nice guys!) would first talk with the taxi driver, explain where we were off to, and to confirm the approximate taxi fare. Really wonderful service! The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reservations manager, Mr. Mustafa Kavak, deserves our special thanks as well. Not only did he ensure that our reservations were properly handled, as were our airport transfers, Mustafa always greeted us with a smile and took a genuine interest in what we were seeing, where we were eating, and just how much we were enjoying his lovely country. Thank you, Mustafa! Lastly, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d also like to mention the hotels maids.

The staffs including Zeinab, Orhan, Goli, Saleh, Farok and all others were amazingly friendly and helpful. This was my second visit to Istanbul after more than 30 years. From what I remember from my first visit, I wasn't impressed at all. The city had changed to the extent beyond anything I was expecting. But I am glad to say that what has made me so impressed this time is hugely owed to the pleasantness and hospitality of the staff of the hotel. It is a small hotel with 20 rooms, a tiny lobby and a small restaurant adjacent to the lobby. But everything is in good proportion. The breakfast was very good with a very good variety of very good quality food. Not all the rooms benefited from the stunning view that our suite did. The suite we'd occupied had a bedroom with a very comfortable twin bed and a living room with two single sofa beds. The living room was a bit compact for two beds. It had a sliding patio window opening into a massive balcony. A bit too big for such a small suite. They could\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve dragged the window a meter or two further into the balcony to make a much bigger room though I could imagine the appreciation of the hotel's summer guests when watching spectacular sunrise and sunset at Bosphor from that balcony. The bathroom had a very well-functioning shower and a Jacuzzi bath tub. The linens and towels were of good quality. Each room had its own flat TV. A free safe was available in the living room. Due to the size of both rooms, there was no dressing table in either of them. There was one big mirror in the living room. The bedroom could have done with a small mirror on the wall. The fitness facilities and sauna and the Turkish bath downstairs were impeccably clean.
