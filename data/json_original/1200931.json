We popped into the Madison bar which was a bit soulless and the service was pretty poor though again it was cheap so acceptable. We tried the Latin bar for an early evening drink but it was dead.

Local landline phones are free while for international calls they request to purchase a calling card of 40AED.

This was recommended to me for its location and low price. As always I checked the reviews on TA prior to booking and there was mixed reviews but its unbelievably low price could not be beaten at the time. I managed to find a rate of \u00a327 GBP per night including breakfast! It is a basic hotel in that it does not have any gym or pool facilities but the standard of the rooms and the hotel itself was the same, if not better, than many 4 star hotels I have stayed in the UK. The hotel and rooms are very clean and well maintained. I often saw managers or senior staff carrying out inspections around the hotel. The Reception staff are friendly and polite and check-in and check-out went smoothly. Free wi-fi in the lounge, cafes and restaurants is a bonus. Wifi is chargeable in rooms and is expensive. Easier and cheaper to pop to the lounge. The cafe is 24 hours which is good for getting a drink or snack or using the computers and internet for free (time limited). I booked a double room for single occupancy. The room was spacious and is exactly as the pictures you see online. The bed was big and comfy (I like a firm mattress) and there was even a small fridge in the cupboard which was great for keeping drinks cool. There are vending machines on each floor selling snacks and drinks. The only slight con if I was to give one was that the bathroom was small and there was no bath. The shower only had half a glass screen and no shower curtain so the floor could get pretty wet. The trick is to try and keep the aim of the shower towards the inside walls! A multi-purpose wash (hand/hair/shower gel) is installed by the sink and in the shower which is usually not expected of 2/3 star hotels. The only thing that was missing was tea/coffee making facilities so I did missing having a cup of tea in the mornings or a hot drink before bed. There was a good selection for breakfast of cereals, fruit, hot breakfast foods, drinks and teas/coffees. Exceeded my expectations for this hotel. I never tried any of the food from the other restaurants or cafe as I always went out. The location is good if you have a car or prepared to take taxis which are very cheap. The hotel is kind of located in the middle of no where but is close enough proximity to main areas. There is not much in its immediate area. The nearest metro station is 'Sharaf DG' and about 5-10 min walk but it is not an easy walk especially in 35+ heat. It involves walking along the main road and crossing two roundabouts with no obvious pedestrian crossings. Taxis are very cheap so I would suggest taking a taxi to your location or to the metro stations: Sharaf DG or Mall of Emirates (5 mins drive). Note, the beach is not 'accross the road' as any maps may lead you to assume! Approx distances/costs by taxi: Jumeirah public beach and beach park = 20 mins (30 Dhs) Mall of Emirates = less than 5 mins (10 Dhs) Dubai Marina = 15 mins (25 Dhs) Dubai Mall/Burj Khalifa/Downtown = 30 mins Airport = 20 mins (40 Dhs) (Taxis from the aiport to the hotel are aprox 80 Dhs) Warning re hotel taxis: There 'hotel taxis' located immediately outside the hotel with nice white cars. The men are very quick to approach you and pursuade you to take their taxi for a fixed price but be warned, they charge double the usual fee of a standard taxi! There are always standard taxis outside the hotel (to the left of the entrance) so just say no thank you and walk away. FYI: Taxi to the Mall of Emirates takes less than 5 mins and costs 10 Dhs which is also the minimum fare (hotel taxi charge 20 Dhs). Always wave down a taxi, never call and book one as this is much more costly. The hotel is fairly new so many taxi drivers may not know where it is. There is an Ibis hotel by the Mall of Emirates so you could be taken there instead. Here are directions to the hotel: Drive to Al barsha on Sheikh Zayed Road, take the exit at Mall of Emirates (Jebel Ali/Abu Dhabi), continue along side Sheikh Zayed Road (SZR) but take the 'Service road' which is a two-lane, two-way road that runs alongside SZR. Continue on this road crossing two roundabouts until you see the hotel on the left hand side. Look for the opening in the barrier and enter onto the hotel grounds (desert). If you miss the turning off SZR or do not take the 'Service Road' you will have to stay on the main road and go all the way around and back to the Mall of Emirates as you can not turn off from SZR! Note many taxi drivers are new to the country so do not know much of Dubai. Even having an address can be useless! Always carry a map and if possible, the telephone number of your destination should you need to call to get directions for the taxi driver. Overall I was very impressed with this hotel considering the mixed reviews on TA and it exceeded my expectations. I had a very pleasant stay and would certainly return again.", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nottingham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cnice staff\u201d", "Author": "broadbase", "ReviewID": "UR119854420", "Content": "Stayed in the hotel in the middle of feb this year.
