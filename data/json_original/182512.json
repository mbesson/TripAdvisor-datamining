My expectations were at the low end of the spectrum, especially since I'd gotten a 50/night USD rate off of Kayak. Have to admit I prejudged the place as a pit and it felt confirmed when I drove up. Actually it was a wrong first impression. Sure the building looked not so new. My checkin was very pleasant and even with my cheap rate was given a room on the 6th out of 7 floors. I fully expected the room do be a dump, but for the price, I could deal with it. Well again, I was surprised. Room 628 with 2 double beds wasn't bad. No drooping wallpaper, nothing ratty, was not bad. I took plenty of pictures do document what I saw. What negatives about the room I did discover were the heater fan was a little noisy on start (it quieted down quickly enough), There was a tiny amount of mold in the caulking of the soap dish in the shower, and the TV remote batteries were dead. Location seemed to be just fine. It wasn't downtown, but it didn't take me very long to drive it. My destination also included Burnaby and it was only 15 or so min there. It was kind of a handy location overall. There was an ATM in the lobby to get cash, and there were several places to eat nearby as well. They did serve the typical continental breakfast which was about as good as anyone else. I did try the place called Reno's and for a cheap meal and breakfast all day, wasn't so bad, not fancy by any means. The room was quiet, with decent beds. No bedbugs whatsoever. Room was clean and I even spoke to the friendly maid. I did hear the Karoke a bit in the evening, but with the room fan on I didn't even notice. I had come prepared with earplugs, but never used them. Shower had decent pressure, plenty of towels and the usual bathroom supplies. With the curtains drawn room was plenty dark. Never saw people lingering around the hotel other than those waiting at a bus stop. In fact the first night there, it snowed and at 2am, there were people playing in the snow on the street. TV had plenty of chanels and the wireless (which you renew each day using a code from the front desk) worked just fine for looking things up and checking messages. I didn't do any real downloads, but for my needs it was fine. Any interactions I had with the staff were friendly and pleasant. I think people have given this place a bit of a bum wrap.

After a word with duty manager she tried to sort the safe out but gave up and gave me three keys for other rooms on the same floor. We found a room with a working safe and clean bedding and moved all our stuff over. We heard a few complaints from other guests, rooms not being cleaned, safes not working. One old gentleman told me that as he had no credit card the manager said rudely \" You will give $100 \" , \"What did you say\" the guest asked, the manager repeated his demand, \"And you will say please\" said the guest. \"I don't need you to teach me manners and if you don't like it get out\" The guest backed down and gave him the money. We asked for a taxi to be booked to go to the airport \"$30 plus $15 for the luggage I was told by the Manager , when challenged about the luggage charge he backed down, we heard of another couple being charged $50 in an unmetered taxi booked by the hotel The area surrounding the hotel isn't great but we didn't encounter any problems ourselves. Due to advise from others we stayed close by at night. The Salt and Pepper Grill was great for breakfasts and evening dinner, the fish and chips are great. The hotel bar was handy for a drink without going out at night I couldn't find anything at all that I liked about the Howard Johnson Plaza, and will book my own accomodation in future", "Date": "May 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "believeme", "Title": "\u201cWhat are they thinking?\u201d", "Author": "believeme123", "ReviewID": "UR10027641", "Content": "\ufeffWhen I arrived at this hotel, I thought, \"Wow, this is not exactly what I thought it was!\" I will say the staff is friendly except for an issue we had with two staff members, but the hotel its self is dingy. Looks like to me they slapped a bit of decorating in places to make it look nice online but once you arrive you feel you need to take a shower as soon as you step in the door. The floors were not clean. Huge dust bunnies in the corners. Nasty finger prints all over the windows and doors. From what it looked like to me, someone had gotten sick outside by the front doors and no one cleaned it up. I didn't want to stay but if I left I would be charged any ways due to the 48-hr cancellation clause. On a plus side we were treated wonderfully by a gentleman at the desk. He made my daughter laugh which was great in my books. I don't think it would be smart to put his name on here but he was a man with dark hair/ touch of gray and a mustache. Thank You Sir for you kindness. As far as the two gentlemen we were not happy with. I think maybe this hotel should do some rethinking about whom they hire. One man was hitting on my daughter. I wanted to loose it on him. Yes she is beautiful and yes she looks older then she actually is but being only 14 years of age is not the only problem I had with this so called gentleman. I heard him make a comment along the lines of what he would love to do to my daughter and then he spoke in his own tongue and I cringe to think what he said. We are use to men hitting on her. What angers me the most is this man from what I was told by one of the staff members is that this man runs the front desk. He shouldn't be doing these kind of things in a family oriented environment. If he wants to be a pervert maybe he should find another job. He was very lucky my husband was not with us. I was too scared to leave my daughter alone at any time during our stay at this hotel. The other thing that upset me is late one night I had gone to get some ice and while I was walking back to our room I saw the security guard getting off the elevator groping a woman in the hallway as they entered a room, I\u2019m not sure if he saw me and if he did he didn\u2019t seem to notice. Needless to say we did not stay our last night. I left feeling dirty and discussed by this outrageous display of filth. I feel no matter how nice this hotel can look and how spotless it can be, there is no amount of money in this world that would convince me to stay there again. I really feel for the hard-working staff at this hotel. Working under and with nasty men such as these must be really hard on them.

My family (husband and 2 sons 10 & 12 and myself) booked 2 nights stay on the hotel website. We thought its a Howard Johnson, must have some standards to keep. Oblviously not. We arrived late in the evening, and found security at the door. The noise from the bar in the lobby made it very difficult to check in, as we had to shout over the kareoke. Very strange comings and goings all around. We were given our key for our double room. We just manage to squeeze the four of us and 2 suitcases into the elevator, and went up to room 723. On the door the sign above the room number said \"office\". Thought a bit strange, but in we go. The room was 1 small room, knocked through to another, room 724. Looking around we thought it seemed dirty, and my husband went to open the window, which was filthy. The beds I noticed were fold outs from the wall, and behind the \"mattress\" I could see alot of dirt in the gap to the wall. I thought about bed bugs, and decided to check out the bed. I lifted the sheets to find not a mattress, but a foamy, the kind you would use for camping. When I lifted this,...this was the worst part..... I found a deep red blood stain, aprroximatley 2 feet in diameter, soaked into the underside of the foamy! When further looking at the bed base, it seemed that whatever happened there, the bed had been folded back into the wall while the blood was still wet, as it had ran down the bed base, while upright. To think that whatever happened here caused so much blood loss was disturbing enough, but to think that the hotel would not even change the piece of foam or even clean the blood stained frame, I find appaulling! After many words with the manager, mainly him tring to put us in seperate single rooms, then 1 single room with a cot (not sure who he expected to sleep on that) We where moved to another double room, which was ment for someone else that had not yet shown up. No doubt they ended up in 723/4. This room was on the 3rd floor, and was a smoking room. We don't smoke, it stunk. The beds were not even 3/4 beds, no hairdryer, no fridge, no peace from the intersection outside our window. We had left the hotel that night too look else where, but with it being the long weekend, we could not find a room for that night. We had stayed at the Best Western Uptown, which is on the same block, once before which was very nice, and we would recommend it to anyone. But it too was full. Needless to say we checked out the next morning, and stayed at a wonderfully clean hotel elsewhere. I wish I had thought to take photos, all I can say is it was a long upsetting night for my entire family.", "Date": "July 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cBrand New Remodeled\u201d", "Author": "thanitha", "ReviewID": "UR7870983", "Content": "We stayed during Memorial day weekend.

I was not charged with surprise fees nor did they change the rates on me, which was good. The only advise I'd give them is that they recarpet their floors since there's a slightly funky smell emanating from their corridors; no funky smell on the rooms though. Some people say the neighborhood is bad and I don't know where they get that! They probably live in Beverly Hills or something. The neighborhood was pretty clean and safe and downtown was only 2 transfers away: take Bus 19 towards Stanley Park get off on Transfer & Main, then take SkyTrain Westbound and get off at Granville Station.

The location was near where our relatives lived in Vancouver, thus chose this hotel. The hotel from the outside is nothing fabulous, but certainly not dungy. Inside, the front foyer nicely decorated. Our room had 2 double beds and it was quite tight for movement for 3 people. The rooms were clean and kept nicely through our stay of 5 days. One disadvantage was that it boasted an outdoor pool in the telephone book ad...no pool. Another thing is they boasted a free breakfast. Well, as we werent told when we checked in if we get free breakfast, we didnt think much of it. The next morning we were on our way out of the hotel and saw a FREE BREAKFAST sign. Oh, we thought, good for the next day. The next morning, went down to the restaurant for free breakfast, was told we needed a voucher from our hotel package, that the restaurant was under new management. Fine, we went to the front desk to obtain one. The front desk personnel indicated it was for new check-ins as of that day, but since we'd checked in the day before, we were eligible and gave us vouchers. The continental breakfast was good, and they had hot items for purchase as well. The next morning, went down again to the front desk, to obtain vouchers for breakfast, we were told they stopped that promo (as the front desk clerk slid the book of vouchers to the side). So we went down and had a hot breakfast and paid for it. It was good and very reasonably priced. We continued to check every morning, were not given anymore vouchers, but still saw vouchers being given out so we werent sure if we not on the A-list for vouchers or how a person was being given them.
