We didn't realize that Hilton Grand Vacations does not operate the same as Hilton in that regard, and we were told that no complimentary upgrades to a better suite could be accommodated (just higher floor). Upon asking what the price would be to upgrade from the Jr Suite to the 1 bedroom suite, we were given one price, which we said no to, then within 5 minutes, the woman checking us in said she would go ahead and give it to us at half price. At that point we took it, but I felt like we shouldn't have had to \"price haggle\" an upgrade - especially being Diamond status with Hilton. That being said, the upgrade was very worth it and we were glad to pay for it. Huge suite with separate bedroom and separated shower/toilet/dressing area in the bathroom. Extensive ceiling to floor amazing views of Vegas with electronic window shades - one of which (in living room area) doubled as a movie screen. The decor was very contemporary (black and red predominant), with an L shaped leather couch doubling as a queen bed. (Our daughter slept there). Full kitchen is always great to have but there no regular coffee for the coffee pot, only decaf, but the front desk quickly sent some up when we notified them. The bedroom had a nice sized jacuzzi which we were looking forward to using. Upon turning on the jets there was a large amount of black \"crud\" in the tub rendering it unusable so I had to drain it. I went downstairs to explain and told them to please have housekeeping clean the jets so we could use it that night, and she apologized, assuring us it would be taken care of. Same issue that night - it was very disappointing. There were a few issues that we felt could not be remedied. One was the room temperature. At night, it was absolutely freezing in the living room (where daughter slept) and burning up beyond belief in our room. The next night we opened up our door and it seemed to be a little better, but then we really missed having privacy at night due to the temperature abnormalities. The second issue is the pool. This is by no means a representation of what most pools in Vegas look like (or Hilton pools, in general), whatsoever - extremely small in comparison. The bigger problem is that those staying at Elara no longer can go to the north pool (more resort-like) of Planet Hollywood if the smaller pool is crowded since it's Hilton now, and that was a huge problem because people were out in droves saving chairs starting early in the morning. There simply were not enough of them and I saw many frustrated guests. What was more frustrating was overhearing people staying at other resorts but \"tagging\" along with friends who were staying at Elara and using the chairs and pool all day. Last complaint is that our daughter (19 years-old) didn't have her key with her to come up to the room where we were (we were on separate flights and didn't arrive together), so security called upstairs to confirm she was with us and then sent her up. There was one other time this happened and a different security guard insisted one of us came down to \"claim\" her (I think those were words verbatim) even though she asked if he could just call up to the room like last time. He said \"Nope, hotel policy\" more than once. This was, of course, embarrassing for her and my husband had to go all the way down to get her (elevators were slow due to busy check-in time) Best part of this hotel is location, the room size itself, the valet and cab stand downstairs (very friendly, prompt & knowledgeable) and the fact that it adjoins to the Miracle Mile shops and Planet Hollywood's casino (there is none at Elara). There's also a nice happy hour in the lobby bar (there's only 1) from 4-7p with reasonable drink specials ($5 wells) & friendly bartenders. Although this was a less-than-steller property and frankly, not worthy of the Hilton brand yet, we will most likely stay here again in the future, only because of location and our loyalty to Hilton. Our hope is that as time goes on, Hilton will be able to fix these glitches from the property ownership change from Planet Hollywood - they just became HGV/Elara on March 1st.", "Date": "April 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aalborg, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, great location.\u201d", "Author": "Mhjort", "ReviewID": "UR129110033", "Content": "We spent 4 night at the Elera and were pretty pleased with it.

Instead of like an airline where they take people from both lines, they left the people in the non-hilton line to wait with no hope of getting checked in. There was quite a bit of actual yelling and rebellion from this line against the floor manager who was clueless...and eventually realized he had to let people from both lines through. Every service was second rate...definitely not up to Hilton standards. Staff was unaware of what facilities they had...wireless network signup didn't work, had to sit on the line with their tech support to walk them through that they probably had to reboot their router... Staff was unfriendly. Checkout was painful. Points didn't post to Hilton (apparently they are barely associated with Hilton).

Also great because there isn't a casino in the actual hotel so it is smoke-free and quiet.

It was booked when the property was the PH Towers, and didn't really think that the switch to HGVC status would be a problem...especially since we are HGVC owners. Oh, so wrong. We are easy-going travelers, have worked in the service industry, and understand that some things just happen. It started when I tried to call the hotel, seeking information about cabana reservations and pricing. In Vegas, of course, reservations can been needed well in advance. After leaving one message, speaking to two separate people, and still not getting an answer on how to proceed with reservations, or any info about pricing, I finally gave up. I called the property itself to see if there were any benefits to being an HGVC owner, and was transferred to a central reservations line, where I sat on hold for a few minutes, only to be transferred again and be told there was nothing. We arrived early on Friday morning, and expected to run into a full hotel...needing to wait for a room to open up. We were with a group and were staying in a two-bedroom suite. As expected, no room ready yet, but they told us to check back in a couple of hours. We went to breakfast, walked around a bit, and called the hotel to check on a status update. I was told by the front desk that they could not tell us over the phone whether or not a room is ready...really? I've stayed at many hotels on the strip that offer to call you when your room is ready. Are we just supposed to keep walking around between 7am and 4pm, walking back every few hours to check-in? The woman at the front desk then told me that it was first-come, first served, based on who was there as the rooms became available. Again...come on! Even though we tried to check in at 7am, if we weren't there at 11am when a room became available, it would go to the next person?? We were able to check in around noon, although we were only able to use half of the room...the one bedroom and common area, as the second bedroom hadn't been cleaned yet. When we were able to go in, the second room had only been partially cleaned. All of the towels were left on the floor, and the trash was still in the room. In the main bathroom, the shower head was broken and only pointed straight down, so anyone taller than 5' 5\" would have to duck and crouch under. We had guests sleeping in each bed, as well as the pull out sofa (which was AWFUL!). There were no extra pillows or bedding for the pull out, so we called housekeeping, and were told they would be brought up. Thirty minutes later, nothing had come, so I called to check and was told it would be at least another 30 minutes. Still nothing...so we left, and when we came back, nothing had been brought up. Called again, and were told that the hotel was \"out of bedding.\" We had to call three times on Saturday to finally get bedding and pillows. Then there is the security guarding the elevators...which is more understandable after reading some of the reviews. I would rather be safe than sorry, but after being having absolutely no leniency for our group, then seeing the guard let someone up early Saturday morning without a card, the consistency is annoying. The pool was nice, but you cannot get access to the pool deck (or outside at all) until 10am. No enjoying coffee outside in the morning, no lounging by the pool before it is 95 degrees. After run on the strip, we tried to go out and the security guard very firmly announced that there was no access until 10am because there is no lifeguard. Again...first property on the strip I've encountered that. Long review and rant, and many of these things wouldn't bother me if it had just been one thing, but it was one thing after another, and the hotel staff's total lack of customer service was appalling. p.s. there is no room service or restaurant in the hotel. no coffee in the morning.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix", "Title": "\u201cNice location not quite yet a Hilton\u201d", "Author": "Zeke78", "ReviewID": "UR128463473", "Content": "If traveling by cab make sure they know it's the old PH towers.

We arrived at the Elara (after driving from LA in our rental car) - we drove to the entrance to unload our bags only to be told we could not stop there to do so unless we were valet parking - we didnt want to do this as we needed to get the car to Hertz Paris Hotel. We explained this to the valet who directed us to the third floor to unload bags and then told us to take the car to Hertz on the eighth floor. My husband let me and my children (and our seven bags) out on the third to check in whilst he returned the car. I was directed by staff to hotel reception though all the Miracle Mile shop and the middle of the casino (it was a VERY long walk), got in the queue to check in only to be told we were in the wrong area and were then directed back through the same way we had come - note there was no offer of help or any sort of trollys available. The Elara hotel entance just looks like another shop on the Miracle Mile (the actual reception area is hidden behind a wall not obvious until you walk well within the entrance) - there were no signs anyway saying it was a hotel let alone its name. My husband finally found us around half an hour later and said there was definately no Hertz area on the floor. We were offered an upgrade to a penthouse suite for a reasonable sum so took it up - turned out to be a great choice as was very luxurious (even if a little tacky in its furnishings). Lack of staff knowledge and signage turned out to be a problem again in our three day stay. We were booked on a Pink Jeep tour of Grand Canyon and were to be picked up from hotel at 6.30am - staff directed us to wrong entrance way - Pink Jeep tours sat at one area whilst we sat at other - lucky for us we had a very experienced guide who decided, before giving up on us completly, to try the back area where we were before we left altogether.

The Elara Hilton Grand Vacations Hotel became my choice at Las Vegas only after a second glance to what was on offer, as I am not too keen about Holywood Planet locations. To make a long story short: The Elara proved me wrong. Coming into the hotel late after a very long journey over from Europe the first good news was the friendliness of the staff. A observation that was confirmed many more times during my stay. Just great. On top of it as a Hilton Honors member I got an upgrade without any extra cost to a small apartment, looking towards the Paris Hotel and the Venetian. The only sad thing was that kitchen equipment like pots and pans as well as slicing boards and cutting knifes had to be requested from housekeeping. This did not cause too much trouble and so it was an easy fix to the problem. As a HH member I was also entitled of internet access free of charge. Another positive surprise, because usually at least a silver or golden status in the Hilton Honors program me is required to get this. The daily rate for Internet access was supposed to be 9.95$ and a weeks pass at 39.95$. In between also a 3-day pass is available for 17.85$. From the lobby you have direct access to the outdoor pool (open 9-18 daily, depending on weather conditions) and to the planet hollywood mall, which offers not only shopping but also a good choice of restaurants and to the planet hollywood casino. Overall a good choice to stay close to the strip without being at the front line of it. The only thing being a bt strange was the choice of the furniture colors.

We booked our stay at what was initially Planet Hollywood Westgate Towers only to discover that Hilton had acquired the property a couple of weeks before our stay. The room was great, however when we arrived we were told that the pool was closed for the whole time during our Monday to Friday stay at the hotel. In addition some rooms (not ours) received a note stating that the entire 2nd floor (where the lobby and access to the Miracle Mile shops and the Strip) would be closed for 24 hours. We were assured that \"friendly staff\" would be present to help us navigate our way around. This unfortunately was not the case. Thursday morning we were told to get off on the 3rd floor go to a 2nd elevator which would take us to the 1st floor which was essentially the parking garage in the basement. We did this and had no clue where we were or how to get to the strip from there. When we asked a staff member from the hotel why we couldn't get off at the 2nd floor lobby (as I had read in one of the notes we were supposed to have received) he stated \"I'm not sure but I think you may be able to get off on the 2nd floor (lobby) after all. He told us to wait right there (in the parking garage) and he would go find out and get back to us. Well we waited for 20 minutes and he never came back. We found another staff member and I tried explaining the situation and our disappointment to him and his response was \"Just what do you want from me ma'am\"! I said I wanted good customer service and directions. He told us in very general and confusing terms go up this way, turn there, etc. I then asked for directions in terms of left and right. This is when he became very rude. He said \"I am no longer talking to you\", turned towards my husband and said \"I will only talk to him\"! I asked to speak to a manager and he refused saying he was a manager. I myself am a business owner and cannot imagine ever treating a client in this mannner.

Billed as being on the strip it is indeed true that the entrance to the Planet Hollywood complex within which the Hilton is housed is on the strip but there is no mention of the hike to the strip entrance/exit from the Hilton which is right at the back of this massive complex.

They had an invite only/ VIP party in the lobby that day and it was a bit inconvenient for guests, but these things happen. The wristband policy which another guest mentioned on their review was not in force during our stay (1st apr to 11 apr). Maybe they've scrapped that idea. If you stay at suites, you have to expect batchelor(ette) parties. They happen. We personally were not bothered by any however. Rooms are spacious and very modern. No problems at all for us, except the housekeeping could have been a higher standard. The shades (controlled on wall) could be stopped at any level by pressing the button at desired height. Bed was extremely comfortable. I did have to call housekeeping for extra linen for our kids in the sofa bed in the living area right enough. Great projector onto the shades, for a home cinema experience. Pool is lovely with very nice loungers and not too crowded compared to some other strip hotel pools.

I would have given it a 4 out of 5. This year is way different! To start off with, we get to our room on the 39th floor, and I notice right away that our bathroom door leading in to the living room and our bathroom door leading to the master bedroom have loose handles and there are no way to lock them. Informed the front desk right away. Never got fixed. Also our alarm clock was busted, the television in the bathroom did not work, and there was a hole in the carpet. With what I pay for maintenance fees you would think this stuff would be fixed! Then on Tuesday morning we were making plans to hit the pool when our friends called us (they are owners too) to tell us that they got a letter saying that the pool is closed on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday for a party they are having on Thursday! Are you kidding me? 1. I got no letter telling me this information. 2. I am an owner. and 3. did they not know this in advance enough that they could have let me know before even came to Vegas? My kids love swimming more than any other part of our vacation. Sure they gave us an alternitave. We could walk through the mall and the casino and use Planet Hollywoods pool, but I am a dang OWNER! I should have the use of MY pool! Also. We use the pull out sofa bed for the kids. There are no linens in the room for that bed so we had to call to get some, then when the maid serviced our room on Wednesday she took all the linens for that bed and did not replace them. I just don't get it! On Friday night the room directly across the hall from me had a bachelor party so there was no chance for a quiet night, and I understand that that stuff comes with the territory, but the stench of smoking that I had to deal with that night and the next morning way disgusting in a no smoking facility.

We've stayed at the PH Towers Westgate before, and LOVED it - so when we were able to get a great deal a few months ago we excitedly booked there again. A few weeks prior to our trip, I noticed (while checking Tripadvisor reviews, ironically enough) that the hotel was now called Elara and that it was now a Hilton hotel. I phoned right away to ensure that nothing would change with our reservation - the person I spoke with assured me that it wouldn't, and that everything would be the same as it was when it was a Westgate property. It wasn't. Well, the building itself was exactly the same - the ONLY physical changes since it's become a Hilton is the exterior signage and the removal of the little 'PH Towers' pillows on the bed. Nothing has been overhauled - even though in many places it's necessary - and there are still several places where 'PH Towers' still exists i.e. the gift shop bags, the sign inside each room door.....Even though the pool was in fabulous shape, we weren't allowed to USE it because of a 'grand-opening celebration' (we're not exactly sure what there is to celebrate in a situation where a hotel hasn't been revamped or improved in any way). We found this out from a letter stuck in our door the morning after our arrival, instead of from an actual person when we checked in, which is incredibly poor customer service - and a really bad start for a company trying to keep previous customers after a take-over. We were told that we could use the Planet Hollywood pool instead, but if you're familiar with the strip you know that it's a bit of a trek (a 13-minute walk - we timed it) to get from PH Towers to the Planet Hollywood pool - a complete pain in the a$s if you already have a perfectly fabulous pool in your own hotel. Then, on the night of the grand-opening celebration, all of the hotel guests were deviated from the usual lobby route to another floor/other elevators if they wanted to get anywhere, which was also an imposition when you're on vacation and want things to be smooth and relaxing. One other interesting piece is that when we checked in, the front desk employee took the $20 I gave him for an upgrade, yet didn't upgrade us. We had the same room we had booked in the first place! (so why didn't he just tell me that he couldn't help us out, and let me keep the $20?) WE WILL NEVER STAY AT ELARA AGAIN.

Stay away!!!\u201d", "Author": "jvevil", "ReviewID": "UR127149866", "Content": "Wow....Where do I start. First I'd like to add a little credibility to my review by stating I've stayed at over ten Las Vegas hotels (all strip hotels minus the HR) and never once have I experienced such terrible service and ridiculous policies. I'm also a timeshare owner (thank god it's not Hilton) and have stayed at other vacation ownership properties. I strongly urge anyone considering a stay here to book elsewhere. Let me start with day one. When you arrive at Elara via cab you will be dropped off at the cabstand which is on level one. You'll have to take an elevator or escalator to level two while carrying your luggage. If a room is not available you will have to carry all your luggage back downstairs to the cabstand area where the bellhop will take your luggage. What's up with this? No bell desk on the same level as the lobby? If the previous developer screwed this up the least they could do is provide bellhops in the lobby area with luggage carts. This would be an easy remedy if Elara had a competent management team that cared about their guests. We finally made it to our rooms later that day and unpacked. We were changing our clothes when a maid entered our room. She walked half way down the hall and realized we were in the room. She never made it all the way into the room and she apologized as she was leaving. An honest mistake but c'mon people. Did you not know this room was occupied? It's not like it was an early check in. The room wasn't anything special. Sure it was larger than an average hotel room but big deal if you have to deal with incompetent hotel staff. Some negatives about the room: one of the bathroom door locks did not work, the freezer was completely frosted over, telephone in the bedroom did not work, one tall glass missing, no full length mirror, no coffee pot (c'mon, a vacation ownership property with no coffee maker?), and the blinds were a bit annoying. They had the cool factor since they could be opened and closed with the touch of a button but there was no inbetween setting. They either had to be fully opened or fully closed. I understand these aren't deal breakers but wanted to point them out to future guests. During our first night we were awakened on three separate occasions by our telephone ringing. We would answer it but nobody would be on the other end. It made for a wonderful first night of sleep. The biggest complaint I have is with their wristband policy. Yes you read that right. Wristbands!!! They implemented the most ridiculous policy during our stay. We were returning to our room the second day when the security guard at the elevator told us we would have to get a wrist band before going to our room. Our jaws dropped. Are you serious Hilton? You expect grown adults to wear a wrist band in Vegas? I can understand a wristband policy for clubs and pools and all inclusive resorts but to get to my hotel room in Las Vegas? Do you think people want to be wearing a wrist band while dressed up and eating out at nice restaurants? Do you think people want to be wearing a wrist band in all their Las Vegas pictures? Do you think people want to sleep with wristbands on? This policy needs to go away NOW!! If you had competent managers you would have never started this policy. I understand you sometimes have guests inviting non-hotel guests over for parties but you deal with these issues on an individual basis. You do not implement a blanket policy for all your guests when it is such a ridiculous policy. My wife and I were so angry we would have checked out if we didn't only have one night remaining. BTW, they have to physically put the wrist band on your wrist and you cannot take it off since they will only issue one extra band to the main guest on the reservations. BTW, the line for the wristbands was about fifty people deep. They wanted every guest to stand in a long line to get wristbands. I can't tell you how many angry people we met in the hotel after this policy was implemented. I can tell there were a lot of complaints because the entire hotel staffs attitude changed overnight. They all became rude. I don't think the staff wanted anything to do with this policy but had no choice in enforcing it. BTW, the security guards at the elevator were also rude while trying to enforce this policy. It was just a very bad idea from the beginning and I can't believe anybody in the hospitality business would even think up such an asinine policy. I called the front desk to ask for a manager so we could discuss the policy but one wasn't available and my message was never returned. I also asked for a manager at the front desk but once again they weren't available. How convenient. I had high hopes for this hotel but it failed us on every level. We will never be staying at Elara again and we will go out of our way to inform future guests and property owners of Hiltons poor service. We will never stay at any Hilton owned properties and hope Hilton gets their act together for the sake of their vacation owners.

I had booked a deal on the old PH Towers website: pay for a Studio Suite (standard room) and get a free upgrade to a 1 BR Suite. At present, the Hilton website has a similar deal, but the upgrade is only to a Junior Suite. I was a little worried that my reservation would get mixed up due to the PH -> Hilton switchover, but luckily those fears were unfounded. Arrival I arrived in a rental car, and there was free parking adjacent to the lobby. As you enter from the bottom floor, you take an escalator up to the 2nd floor which is where the lobby is. The hotel has a sleek/modern decor (compared to some of the more \"luxury\" decors at Venetian/Wynn). Check-in was easy and we were able to get our rooms at 1pm even though check-in was at 4pm. Rooms - 10/10 We had two separate 1 BR Suites; one on the 19th and one on the 20th. Both had nice views; one faced south towards the pool area and the MGM Grand, and the other faced north towards Paris, PH, and Ballys. The rooms were GREAT. Spacious living room and kitchen area, complete with a big leather couch, full sized fridge, and a table with seating for six with a flat screen TV on the wall over the table. The living room had floor to ceiling windows, another flat screen on the wall, and shades that came down at the push of a button. The real kicker was the HD projector mounted on the wall that used the shades as the screen. In essence you had your very own mini theater right in the room! We watched various sports games on this screen, and it's something I've never seen in any other hotel room. The bedroom was also spacious, with another flat screen TV, ample closet space, and a mini jacuzzi in the room. Finally, the bathroom had two sinks, a separate toilet area, and a shower stall. The bathroom was connected to both the living room and the bedroom, although there were two doors. There was even a washer/dryer in the bathroom under the sink. The rooms were large enough to easily accommodate 4 people, although we only fit 3 and 2 in the rooms. Facilities: 8/10 There was a gym which members of our party used (I did not); they mentioned it was sufficient, but lacked things that you would find at a larger fitness facility (such as an ab machine). The pool area was nice, but not as \"fun\" as other Vegas pools I've visited. They also had a bar out near the pool area which I didn't try. The lobby bar was also pretty nice, and I caught glimpses of a few sports games as I walked to other parts of the hotel. Location: 9/10 The hotel is adjacent to the Miracle Mile shops, which is an assortment of clothing and food stores between the Elara and the Planet Hollywood Casino. We had lunch in the complex a couple of times and it was pretty convenient. The Planet Hollywood casino is about a 6 min walk through the indoor mall. The hotel itself is across the street from the Cosmopolitan, although it's a bit tough to get there directly due to the Strip crossings (you have to go up escalators, then walk across, then down). It's easier to walk north towards Ballys and cross the street there. Other thoughts The listed checkout time is 10am. As a Hilton Honors Gold member, I expected to be able to check out a little later, especially since we checked out midweek when there's less demand. However, it was a bit of a struggle to get the checkout moved; we were asked to call the front desk at 7am, which would have defeated the purpose. Eventually we did get the checkout moved, even though it took a little back and forth. There was a hotel worker by the elevators checking room keys. It was kind of annoying at first but I guess they want to keep the rooms safe. Summary: I would highly recommend this hotel for a younger crowd (Spring Break / Bachelor / Bachelorette / Bday party. It's in a pretty central location and good for a younger crowd. Fun times and I would consider it next time I'm in LV", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cVegas in the Springtime\u201d", "Author": "Janice V", "ReviewID": "UR126039407", "Content": "My boyfriend had bought into the Planet Hollywood Towers before they opened in 2010. This is the first opportunity we had to go and found out just before we left that the property was now managed by Hilton. Arrived on Friday at 11 and told to come back at 3:30 as there were special floors for the owners and nothing was ready yet on those floors. We went over to the Planet Hollywood casino and had a quick lunch at PF Changs and when we got back there were lines, separate for Hilton Honors club holders, they went pretty quickly and when we got up to the desk they were very helpful and gave us lots of information on what was going on with the change. He has a one bedroom suite and studio suite connected and we booked the entire unit thinking some friends might join us but didn't at the last minute so we had the whole place to ourselves. Wow, when we got to the rooms,they were spectacular! Full kitchen with a sit down table for four when you come into the one bedroom. A great view out of floor to ceiling windows with a leather sectional that you can watch one of the many flat screen televisions that are everywhere or choose to put down the shade that doubles a projection screen (15'x10') in the living room. The bedroom is spacious and has a large jacuzzi tub next to the bed as well as separate stalls for the shower and toilet. Also a floor to ceiling window for great views from anywhere in the room. There is a small washer/dryer built into the vanity in the bathroom for underwear or small items (if you can figure out how to use it) also the standard hair dryer and magnifing mirror mounted to the wall near the sink. The studio had a kitchenette with a small refrigerator and microwave when you walk in, large closet with safe same floor to ceiling windows with view, very spacious bathroom with separate toilet stall and a jacuzzi tub and shower combo. In both rooms there was a blender and toaster in the kitchen as well as stocked cabinets with anything you could need to cook in the rooms. It was decadent but nice to have both units to spread out in. Very deco/Hollywood vibe furnishings and artwork but comfortable and great mattresses but terrible foam pillows. The pool area was open and the pool is heated but we didn't have time to enjoy it this trip. Overall, great location, accommodations and service. The down side was a very young, hard partying group when we were there (the larger suites are perfect if you want to have parties or are staying as a group) so the halls are full of noise all night long. We were told that there are special floors for owners that have special amenities (like the fully equipped kitchens) so ask what is included if you are a \"transient\" as they call anyone who is not part of the timeshare staying there.

I guess I didn't do as much research as I should have but I assumed that a condo would have a bedroom. I booked through a third party and didn't realize that a studio condo was an option. I had just saw the one and two bedroom condo floor plans. Just incase anyone else has any confusion on what a studio condo is, it is a hotel room with a few plates and bowls, a tiny fridge and a dishwasher. The location of the PH towers is ok. It is a little further south than I like but I like to be next to O'shea's and Casino Royal where I can play some table games with lower minimums. The food is was pretty good. It was a little chilly for the pool but one day it was in the 70's and seemed like it could be a good time in a few months. I did learn that you can't use the Planet Hollywoods pool if staying at the PH towers since they are two seperate entities.

We were able to check our bags at the bellhop and venture around the strip waiting to check in. I arrived back to the front desk around 2PM and approached the same girl at the check in, she was polite and remembered me from earlier that day.

As she looked I handed her my ID and credit card with a $20 in-between. Without saying anything she took the 20 and pocketed it. After a few more minutes she asked if the 2 bedroom penthouse would be okay! Getting off the elevator we had a long way to walk because our room was at the very end of the hall. After opening the double doors to the penthouse we were greeted to an amazing view from the floor to ceiling windows in the living room. Both master and the 2nd bedroom were huge and offered plenty of space for 6-8 people. The master was situated on the corner of the building and offered floor to ceiling windows on 2 walls. The bathroom had an amazing Jacuzzi sitting right on the windows over looking the strip. This room was so nice it made it hard to leave (not bad for under $200 a night). We called for our bags when we walked in the room, they were delivered within 10 minutes. Maid service was also very good, they came every day and even asked every time I saw them in the hallway if they could get anything for us.

Liked - projection TV, music stations through TV - dishwasher - buttons for privacy, cleaning service - double bathroom sinks - spacious living area - modern lighting and decor throughout - security checking for room cards by elevators Didn't like - no bathroom fan; black toilet - sofabed mattress is basic quality - no pots/pans (although no pots/pans was identified in the PH Twrs website) - cabbie taking us for a ride (via hiways) $25 before tip from LAS - all the salespeople approaching you when you walk through the mall March 1 2012, this property became \"Elara, a Hilton Grand Vacations Hotel\".", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201c2 Bedroom suite\u201d", "Author": "KYM123", "ReviewID": "UR125535257", "Content": "The view in this room it pricelss! They have a projector that drops down as curtains, a full kitchen, a washer & drying, & a jacuzzi. The room was large with an L shaped couch. The down side: small closets, room & bathrooms need more lighting, & the biggest downside we had: there was no spatula & only 1 pot & pan. This was our biggest downside because we had a lot of people in this room & 1 pot & pan was not cutting it to cook for everyone. The no spatula thing might be small, but you can't really cook eggs without one. The sink in the kitchen also didn't have a grinder, so you had to pick everything out so it doesn't clogged. I've stayed at the signature MGM & their kitchens have EVERYTHING you need & more! They have these large bowls so you can service large dishes & more than ONE pot & ONE PAN. They have free valet too & great customer service! The best part, all for about the same price! They're right across the street from PH towers too! So really, there's no down side to the signature MGM! Also, when booking the 2 bedroom, we wanted to book an additional room to connect, but we were told that we cannot book 3 bedrooms suites. We can only ask for it when we check in. Kind of weird! I would know I work for a hotel in San Diego. Especially weird because the 2 bedroom we got had connecting doors to not just for 1 more additional room,but for 2! So we could have had a 4 bedroom suite! So overall, the room was nice & beautiful, but when I compare to where I've stayed before (Signtaure MGM), it just doesn't compare!", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, CO", "Title": "\u201cA Travel Writer's Opinion - Huge Rooms, Limited Amenities\u201d", "Author": "TravelbyLori", "ReviewID": "UR125516997", "Content": "The Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino has followed the lead of many luxury resorts on the Las Vegas Strip by adopting an adjoining sister hotel. Unlike others, however, the hotel includes residential timeshare condos and was built in partnership with Westgate Resorts. This marriage has resulted in the only timeshare-slash-hotel in the world directly linked to a luxury hotel and casino. What does this mean for you? If you have your eye on a Vegas vacation, it means choosing ph Towers Westgate guarantees you will have the space of a condo with convenient access to a lively casino and all that Vegas visitors expect from that particular experience \u2013 the restaurants, shops, spa and shows. If you are considering a timeshare in Sin City, it means much closer proximity to the action than was previously available. Because ph Towers is a condotel, every room is a suite. I have stayed in many suites, some that I feel took a lot of liberty with the \u201csuite\u201d definition (i.e. the existence of a two-person couch at the foot of the bed and a mini-fridge in the closet does not make the room a suite) and some that truly have a residential feel to them. This hotel falls into the latter category with suites that could be lived in, even on a permanent basis. In fact, I have never stayed in a Vegas hotel with larger standard rooms. I always pay particularly close attention to room design. To me, a room needs to be beautiful, functional and have homey comforts in order to impress me. Ph Towers\u2019 d\u00e9cor is, fittingly for the Las Vegas locale, ultra modern. Rooms are decorated in tuxedo black, lipstick red and bright white in a particular style of beauty best described as glamorous. One-bedroom and two-bedroom suites have a full-size and fully-equipped kitchen with a table that seats six. Roominess aside, stand-outs for this property are the projection screen theater in the living area and the hot tub next to the bed. Another plus good enough to mention are the mirrors. They are everywhere. The hotel compensates for the areas in which it lacks by giving their owners and guests complete access to the amenities of Planet Hollywood. For example, although the hotel has a beautiful and sunny pool and cabana area, guests looking for a spa treatment need to visit Planet Hollywood. For guests who crave casual shopping, the Miracle Mile shops are ultimately well-positioned practically in the lobby. To give you an idea of shop proximity, while taking a self-guided tour of the main level of the hotel, I found myself suddenly (and happily) in the middle of the mall. Ph Towers Westgate is making its mark on the Vegas luxury hotel market because of its unique features. I recommend it for travelers who want room to spare without giving up casino action. Its glitz and reasonable pricing also make it extra appealing to a younger crowd. My husband and I have a YouTube channel of luxury hotel video reviews. Visit YouTube.com/TravelbyLori.

Unfortunatly that wasn't the case for us. It was my 21st birthday and it took 2 hrs to check in with only 2 people on the reception. Once we finally checked in we were given the wrong room and when I explained to the staff that was not what I booked they were unfriendly and unhelpful telling me there were no rooms avaible as to what I had booked. So not only did I not get the room I had booked I was 2 hrs late for my dinner reservations due to the long wait at reception then it took an extra 40min for my luggage to be brought to my room. The room was clean and nice ill give them the credit for that but my disappointment was topped off with the fact we were double charged for Internet and again were faced with unhelpful staff.", "Date": "March 2, 2012"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Elara, a Hilton Grand Vacations Hotel - Center Strip", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g45963-d1639337-Reviews-Elara_a_Hilton_Grand_Vacations_Hotel_Center_Strip-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html", "Price": "$111 - $245*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">80 E.
