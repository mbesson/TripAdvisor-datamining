Once shown to my room I was greeted by a strong musty smell that was quite overwhelming. None of the windows opened and the view was just awful... The beds were also in a terrible state and wasnt comfortable at all. While we was there we had our own towel taken from our suitcase, I guess this could be a mistake as it was a plane white one, but it was expensive and when we mentioned it to the staff they couldn't care less.. the spa is only 10 euro, but only consists of 1 little steam room and 1 sauna. If you want a massage you have to pay at least 100 euro's!.. There inst anything positive I can say about this place.. Oh yeh, close to the train station..

Also there is no parking available and if you park on the street you could it towed or ticketed. The good news is that when I called the desk first thing in the morning they more than accomodated me, they very quickly provided us with a new better room (at the same price) and very quiet, offered us use of the spa, and sent someone to our room to transfer our baggage to the new room. The location is right on the river and the restaurant next to the hotel is great, 2 nights we sat on the patio over looking the river and had drinks or dinner. You can see the Friedrickstrause station from the hotel which was very convient and everyone was really nice.

Rooms vary according to budget, we took a basic double which was reasonably clean and comfortable and what we felt was a realistic enough price. The spa attached to the hotel offers a favourable guest rate of ten euro for use of the sauna, steam and relaxation room. All towels, slippers etc are provided and this represents an excellent value chill out before a night on the tiles.

This hotel has in fact two in one. I experienced both because I spent the first night in one part (I was alone on a business trip) and two other nights in the second one (my girlfriend joined me for the week-end). The room I spent my first had nothing exceptional, and if my evaluation was based on this only experience, it would not have been very good. But, my evaluation is based on the two nights we spent on the second part of the hotel. An expensive (over 200 euros per night at the time) but wonderful experience. Worth the price. We had one of the rooms with a bronze bath tube, and a panoramic view over the Spree (the room had floor to ceiling windows through which one can see without being seen from the outside). The major drawback was the cleanliness of the windows (Ok but not immaculate). One also have to appreciate the decoration: a bit peculiar (I assume the style is not to be taken litteraly).", "Date": "August 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buckinghamshire", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, quirky hotel\u201d", "Author": "Buckinghamshireman", "ReviewID": "UR5026839", "Content": "I stayed here one night on business, having had the room booked for me by my German colleagues. The other reviews on this site are pretty accurate. The location is great, right on the river side, but the hotel itself is rather quirky.

The curtains were old and plastic and everything had been painted with amateurish art deco flourishes. However, it was clean and I was happy staying there. As a note to any football fans, it is minutes away from a red light district, but as a note to families, I didn't see any of these ladies at all, when I walked down the same street looking for lunch during the daytime.

When up on the second floor you had to once again use the key to unlock a second door in order to enter a narrow corridor with a very low ceiling. Very strange. The decor in the room was old and spartan, faded oranges and yellows, beds without head boards, plastic-like side lockers and a radio attached to the wall that seemed to be 25+ years old.
