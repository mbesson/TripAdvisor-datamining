The hotel is a great value if you factor in the size of the suites, the quality of the finishes, and the breakfast. We've never stayed during the week, but they offer light meals which are posted on the refrigerator in the room. Rooms have granite countertops, dishwashers, microwaves and all the utensils you need. We were able to check in early when we arrived, and we appreciate the noon checkout, as it seems more and more that 11 is the checkout time. Breakfast always has at least 3 hot items, and the staff make it feel more like a restaurant than a cheap continental breakfast hotel. Very impressed with the pool and whirlpool. The location is bit strange as it's kind of tucked in to the parking lot of the much larger Hilton Garden Inn.

They could not consistently deliver hot water to my bathroom and shower. On one morning, I could not get anything better than lukewarm water. The following morning the situation was worse. I complained to the front desk, and a maintenance man was sent to the room. His diagnosis was too many people were taking showers at the same time. (Most of the guests, including me, were attending a conference, and we were all beginning the day at the same time.) I've been to many conventions and conferences in my life, and I have never before encountered a hot water issue in a convention hotel. I didn't even get an apology for my cold showers.

Our eight-year-old enjoys a hotel pool immensely. It's like giving her an extra Christmas gift. The room is very clean. The king bed is comfortable, the bathroom spotless, and there is a full kitchen with full sized fridge, microwave, cooktop, dishwasher, and sink. The fold-out couch was a perfect spot for our daughter. The free breakfast is very good quality. It's a large variety of good food. Lots of fresh fruit and healthy options as well as eggs and sausage and a waffle bar. Good coffee. No Truvia, but there is Splenda - a key consideration when I travel. I hate having to supply and carry around my own sweeteners. The staff is very friendly. I had no trouble securing a later check out, and maintenance was very responsive when I requested extra towels. The pool area is well maintained and attractive. The only drawbacks are very minor ones. They are not, in my opinion, enough of a big deal to detract from my 5 rating. The wifi is much slower in the rooms than in the lobby. When you're working from your hotel room, this is a consideration. The second minor drawback is the amount of chlorine this pool uses. Our visit may have corresponded with freshly shocking the pool, but the smell of chlorine was a bit strong. I bought a pre-paid deal through Homewood Suites website and got the room for $78 a night. I felt this was an excellent value for the quality of the room, the convenience to my family's homes, and the quality of the breakfast.

They had rooms blocked at this hotel and at the I-Hotel. I opted for this one because it had continental breakfast and I'm so glad I did...and for more reasons than just the breakfast! First off, the lobby is nice and clean and the frontdesk staff greeted me the second I walked in the door. My check in was quick and efficient. This might not seem like a big deal, but I've stayed at plenty of hotels where it seems you are the first person to have EVER checked-in because it takes them so long. People checking in at hotels are usually weary travelers who do not want to wait forever to get into their room, so I really appreciated that. Second, the room was incredibly spacious and very clean (as were all common areas). There is a kitchenette which was nice because we could keep leftovers AND a microwave to reheat! Heaven! Third, there is a Gumby's pizza next door, 'nuff said Fourth, and this is the real humdinger, the breakfast was NOT what I consider a continental breakfast. It was a delicious hot meal AND they changed the offering (new selection) the second day of our stay! They had scrambled eggs with chives & cheese with sausage patties on the first day (Sat) and scrambled eggs with bacon on the next. Furthermore, they have all kinds of other treats; boxed cereal, yogurt, oatmeal, cream of wheat, pastries, a large selection of teas (Tazo brand at that), and fresh fruit salad. Last, I just want to mention a couple of the extras that really sealed the deal for me. They have free wi-fi, neutrogena hygiene products, and you can go down to the front desk and pick a DVD from their selection (not huge, but with recent releases and truly something for everyone) that you can take to your room to view....ALL FREE. Plus, I saw a sign in the elevator that said \"Join us in the lobby for complimentary dinner and drinks M-Th\". Now it's getting almost comical. Now I've stayed at some very nice hotels, so it isn't like one of the Clampett's is at the helm right now. I've seen the luxuries and footed the bill and I have to say that I was easily just as comfortable here. Besides, I still find it mind boggling that fancy hotels always charge for internet.

Rooms: Spacious. Includes full-sized fridge, microwave, stovetop, sink...wonderful. Climate control is easy to maneuver. Room temp always perfect. Windows could open a few inches to get fresh air. Bathroom: Great shower! Neutrogena products. Complimentary Breakfast: assorted hot and cold items. Definitely better than average. Nice-sized dining room with different-sized tables. Several TVs w/news or cartoons:-) I wish I didn't have any negatives to report, but I do have 2 things: 1) Custodial services for public areas did not keep up with hallways. I always saw dishes, plates, glasses along guest floor hallways...the same dishes, etc for hours and hours. Trash cans outside and in the breakfast area did not get emptied often enough. 2) Parking was a challenge. This hotel is next door to the Hilton Garden Inn and Conference Center. That property hosted several wedding receptions during our stay, making parking very difficult in the evenings. I will definitely return to this hotel again. I rarely find myself so comfortable at a hotel, and this one was fantastic. And, I can't close my review without complimenting the friendly staff: front desk, breakfast staff, housekeeping. All were wonderful.", "Date": "June 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orland Park, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cI do believe that I have a new FAVORITE hotel!\u201d", "Author": "ChicagoLawyerGuy", "ReviewID": "UR32793339", "Content": "Extremely awesome!!! I think that the designers of this hotel did an excellent job! All the materials used are so well put together - impressive! The bed, comforter and pillows are as nice as it gets - bar none!

The lobby and breakfast areas are beautiful and large. The hot breakfast is very nice and there is plenty of room to enjoy your breakfast without being on top of your neighbor! My kids said the pool has a bit much chlorine but they enjoyed it anyway. Everything is wonderfully clean and all the workers has smiles and were very pleasant! Can you tell I enjoyed my stay? Staying at this Homewood Suites is one of the real treats in Champaign. Oh yeah, down the street and around the corner is an old fashioned ice cream custard place called Jarlings.

We're a family of 4 on a military move from Alaska to Florida. Our military rate was $109 before taxes, and it once again felt criminally low for what you get here. The hotel's location isn't very convenient to the Interstate if you're just passing through, but it's practically on the UofI campus and it's very close to downtown. There are plenty of nearby eateries, but it's a Homewood, so you don't really need them! We stayed on a Monday night and it was chicken fajitas. They were delicious and the kids gobbled them up. There was desert, salad, rice, a taco bar, and of course free beer and wine. This location didn't ration the booze and was self service. Breakfast was also great with hot and cold selections, great coffee service, and all kinds of baked goods. The pool and hot tub were spacious, clean, and nice and included a shower area. The kids were loud but no one could hear it outside the pool area. The fitness center was big enough for 5+ people to use simultaneously. The business center has 2 computers with printers. Our room, a one bedroom, was great. The king bed was comfortable with nice sheets and covers. The pillows were soft and numerous. The TVs were nice LG flat panels with good cable and no \"hotel menu\" stuff. You can rent new DVDs at the front desk or there are a bunch you can borrow from the business center. The bathroom (which is in the bedroom side of the suite) was standard Homewood (very nice) as was the kitchen. The door between the bedroom and living room was heavy and made both sides feel private. This hotel in a college town was hosting some summer seminar classes as well as a fire fighter's training session. For how young and fun the clientele looked, it was an extremely quiet evening. The hallways are quiet and the rooms are quiet. I really wish we weren't in such a hurry through town. I give Homewood Champaign my highest recommendation! If you haven't ever stayed at a Homewood, start here!", "Date": "June 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn, NY", "Title": "\u201cIt's wonderful!\u201d", "Author": "megan73", "ReviewID": "UR29055393", "Content": "I really enjoyed my stay here.

What's nice about this hotel is from check in to check out everything and everyone was WONDERFUL! There is no reason to have to leave the hotel once you arrive after work. They even give you a DVD player in your room. I have to say this is The Best Hotel I've ever stayed at for Work!!!!! You will not go wrong here.

The front desk staff told us not to buy any and went back to the kitchen and brought us up a pint of milk on the house. When we got up to the room it was clean, new, and spacious. The hotel was built in April of 07. The king bed was very comfortable and the couch had a pullout bed for my boys. Fully equipped kitchen complete with a dishwasher. The hotel was quite empty the night we stayed, it was very quiet. The hotel sits on the main street, lots of restaurants; we went to dinner at Fridays about a block down the road. Both TV'S in the room were flat screen and 37 inches. The indoor pool was great for the kids after a day of driving; however the hot tub does not have bubbles, how strange.

When we arrived just after midnight, the desk clerk seemed annoyed at our arrival and was perfunctory at best in checking us in, spewing out pool and breakfast times by rote, making no eye contact, not asking if we needed help, etc. We went to the complimentary breakfast service 45 minutes before the scheduled closing, and there was no coffee, hot water, pastry, orange juice, or bacon. After finally getting a clerk's attention, they managed to bring out some coffee and water, but nothing else, despite specific requests.
