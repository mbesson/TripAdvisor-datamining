The building itself is rather unremarkable from the outside, but very ornate inside with plenty of polished wood & brass, marble and chandeliers. The 'superior' rooms are well decorated with a balcony, but of an average size; beds are a good size and reasonably comfortable. Each room has a large flat screen TV, and (a very expensive) minibar. Two things that are lacking are tea/cofee making facilities in the room, and any means of ironing - the hotel does not supply an iron, so bring your own! The breakfast is very good with an extensive choice. We did not eat in the hotel restaurant as it was quite expensive, quite empty and not the kind of place that children will have appreciated. From May onwards, there is also a grill restaurant that is open which might provide more casual dining. There are quite a few restaurants nearby, within 10 minutes walking distance: both Casa Mia & Taverna Rossini can be highly recommended. The spa is excellent with a large pool and was a great place for everyone to relax after a hard day's sightseeing. Caps are required for the pool and can be purchased for \u20ac5. The outdoor pool is also open from May onwards. It is possible to walk to via veneto in about 20 minutes and to the Spanish Steps in 30 minutes. The hotel does provide a shuttle service to these locations, but you have to make your own way back. You can catch the number 19 tram nearby and it will take you to direct to St Peter's and the Vatican. The number 3 bus (also from a nearby stop) will take you to the Colliseum and Roman Forum, although the route is fairly circuitous! Tickets are \u20ac1 each (children under 1 m height are free) and need to bought from a newstand (closest is via veneto) and then validated on the bus/tram. The hotel airport transfer is expensive; taxis are a bit cheaper, but the best option is to pre-book online with Rome Cabs who provide an excellent and reasonably priced service. This is (I believe) the only hotel in central Rome with a pool, and its quite location next to the park makes it an excellent (albeit, expensive) choice if travelling with children.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cNot Bad, Not Great\u201d", "Author": "continuitygirl", "ReviewID": "UR127947988", "Content": "We stayed here for business recently, the hotel was very nice if a little old fashioned, but it did feel like it was in the middle of nowhere as you either had to get taxis or walk for about 20 minutes to get anywhere.

Upon arrival to the hotel the appearance of the building was less than five star, but we had been expecting this after reading other tripadvisor reviews. Once we pulled up to the grand entrance we were impressed. This was clearly a five star lobby. We had also organised an E class Mercedes Benz to transfer us from the airport at a cost of 72 euros. This was organized via an email address given to me by a fellow tripadvisor member. This service was good because taxis cost 60 euros and we could have booked a transfer through the travel agent for a much higher cost per person. So we thought it better to arrive in style. At the airport the driver was waiting for us with a sign in my name (I had requested it to say Mr and Mrs ... but it just said our surname. My new wife was slightly disappointed at this). We were given a room on the forth floor (we had paid extra for a deluxe double), it met our expectations and we had been given a room with a fantastic view to St Peter's Cathedral and out over the Villa Borghese Park. The room did smell of stale smoke on arrival but to be fair we hadn't requested a smoking or non-smoking room as we hadn't realised you could get rooms that allowed smoking. We just got used to the smell and didn't notice it after the first day. The bed was a twin pushed together and we had requested a double but as the view from the room was so nice we didn't want to risk getting an inferior room if we complained. The bed was nice and big and comfortable. The sheets were luxurious. The TV was great with a wide selection of movies etc. We paid $25 euro's for 24 hour unlimited access to programmes which was great when we just fancied a break from walking around. The mini bar was extortionate but we never used it. Instead we purchased water and alcohol from the many refreshment stands in the park and took them back to the room where there was space for them in the mini bar fridge. No one ever removed them and we had no extra charges on our bill. We considered eating in the hotel restaurant for ease but decided against it only due to the fact we'd probably be the only people eating in there. We didn't fancy a restaurant all to ourselves. The menu did sound good, a little pricey but no different to some of the other restaurants we visited in Rome. We had a drink at the bar one night which was nice to sit in the plush surroundings, a peroni cost $7 and a pina colada $14, it was expensive but worth it. The hotel is most definitely geared up for the business traveller rather than the tourist, and certainly doesn't provide any little extra touches for a couple on honeymoon. We did realise this though before booking due to other reviews placed. It was a little disappointing but we went for the hotel mainly because of the spa and its antique Italian style d\u00e9cor. The breakfast, which was included in our room rate had an extensive choice of items, from cooked meats, cold meats, cheese, smoked salmon to pastries, cakes, cereals, donuts and yoghurt's, not to mention the fresh fruit selection and variety of drinks on offer including prosecco which yes we did indulge in, seeing as it was our honeymoon! The Prince Spa was amazing. We used it as often as we could. We had to fill in a form on our first visit and we gave our room number each time we used it but had no more forms to fill in on each visit. We knew from reviews about having to wear a swimming cap so we brought some with us and we were fine to wear these. The spa staff were happy to provide you with a robe and flip flops or for you to bring them from the room. The male sauna area was closed for maintenance work during our stay but this meant that men could use the female facilities, this worked out perfectly for us as we could stay together. The relaxation area was lovely to lie in after a swim and sauna and you are provided with mint tea or water. It was a little colder than we'd have liked in this area. There was a real flame effect fire on the wall in this room but I'm not sure if it worked or just gave the appearance of being warm. We enjoyed sitting in here with a book after a spa session. We didn't use the gym or the I-Food lounge. We considered having a treatment but they were quite expensive as to be expected. It was enough to use the spa facilities. The location was a 25/30 minute walk into the centre of Rome. The first time we walked it it did seem a long way but once we got used to it it was nothing and it is a lovely and romantic park to stroll through. There are bikes, golf carts and go carts available to hire in the park for a reasonable cost, we just ran out of time to do this. In the park is the Zoo which we did visit. It was $13 each per adult. It was worth a visit and the animals seemed happy and well cared for (we are always a bit dubious about Zoo's). Once you reach the edge of the park you suddenly find yourself overlooking Rome, it is a breathtaking view! If you turn left you'll reach the Spanish steps, take a right and you'll end up at the People's Piazza. We ate in a variety of places including the Hi Res restaurant at Hotel Valadier just off Piazza del Popolo. It is a modern restaurant with stunning views over the rooftops of Rome, well worth a visit for a special evening. It's at the pricier end but good food and wine menu's.

Therefore some bits have more character than others. Rooms: Not massive, we had a twin room but the beds were close together - I prefer a twin room to have a bedside cabinet (at least) between the beds. The most disappointing thing about the room was the balcony which had no furniture on it. Beds: The bed was a bit hard for both my friend and I. I'm not usually that fussy, but this one was a bit too hard. Location: The walk into the centre during the day is a lovely walk, you walk through the Villa Borguese Park, then come out at the top of the Spanish steps or into Plaza dei Pompei if you prefer. It takes about 20-30 minutes but it is a lovely walk. However, at night, not quite the same, the park is closed and the walk along the roadway is not pleasant, definitely time for a taxi. The Spa: I would still come back to this hotel because of the Spa. Hardly any hotels in Rome have indoor pools, this hotel has a large (20-25 metre) indoor pool. Beside the pool is a spa circuit (the water is warmer in the spa circuit. Then through a small opening from the pool is the Sauna and Steam room areas. These are split into male and female. The pool has good opening hours so easy to get a swim in before breakfast and late in the evening. Entry to the pool is free if you are staying at the hotel. Spa Beauty Treatments: We had mixed success. I had a lovely reflexology treatment and a good massage but my friend was disappointed with her hot stone massage. The treatments are VERY expensive so look out for morning sessions when they offer 20% off the price. Catacombs: There are some great catacombs circa 25 minutes walk from the hotel (in the opposite direction to the main centre) The catacombs of Priscilla, 00199 - via Salaria, 430 - tel. & fax 06 86 20 62 72 (closed on Mondays)", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow", "Title": "\u201cGood base for a city trip but primarily a business hotel\u201d", "Author": "looooosey", "ReviewID": "UR126605612", "Content": "Just returned from a four night trip to Rome.

Stepping inside though it has been beautifully decorated in an opulent style throughout. The staff were helpful and efficient and our room was just as described, good size and lovely decor. Have to say that the breakfast every day was fantastic, everything you could want and even a glass of prosecco if you wish. The hotel is a 15 min walk into the city itself but as you are walking through the beautiful Borghese gardens this is nothing but a pleasure.We did not have time to use the spa unfortunately as after a long day of sightseeing by the time we got back to the hotel we were ready just to crawl into bed.

A vodka diet coke and a vodka tonic was 32 euro. The minibar is also quite pricey. I think a vodka was 13.5 euros. I think the spa is owned or run by a separate company. They were very strict on who comes in and out. Everyday they checked who we were, room number, sign for this, sign for that, etc. which to be honest got a little irritating. The treatments are good and the spa facilities are excellent. Try the emotional showers and the jacuzzis. You have to wear a swim cap in the pool or they will charge you 6 euros for one. The gym is excellent but the food at the little cafe was poor. Food in the restaurant was ok, the portions were very good and of course, as with all bars and restaurants in Rome, it came with lots of little extras. There are taxis outside the hotel day and night. The Via del Corso shopping area is about 12 euros away. This area is well worth a visit.

Big balcony, modern bath, comfortable beds, nice bath products, plush towels and great air conditioning (a must for Rome in the summer). Maid service was twice daily. The outdoor and indoor pools are fantastic -- by far in my opinion the best draw to this place. However, as others have mentioned the outdoor pool closes at 6pm which is way too early and partially negates one of the major plusses of this hotel. The hotel grounds are very quiet and it has a club-like exclusive feel. This is, as others have mentioned, where the trade off comes it. It is quite a distance from the major attractions of Rome. Cabs are not always stationed out front, which means waiting a few minutes for one and they can become expensive back and forth to the center of Rome say twice a day. The staff is professional, but somewhat indifferent and they dont really go out of thier way to help you find the best way back and forth from your sightseeing. In fact there are no maps, guides, etc in the lobby (you need to ask at the desk) and they dont give the best directions as to how to get somewhere, although some of that is likely a language barrier. It is possible to walk to the area of the Spanish Steps but its not a quick walk. Also, there are really no shops, cafes, etc within quick walking distance of the Parco...which means you need to really plan well and have your Caffe, Gelato, Vino, Snacks, etc while still in the center of Rome before getting into a taxi, or else you will be stuck with one of the Parco's big negtives -- food and drink is limited and very expensive.

Hotel is very inviting and comfortable with an especially nice lobby area fully of couches and little sitting areas where you can meet friends or relax. Guest room was also very comfortable and well outfitted, with attractive and modern bath. Decor was a bit \"heavy,\" and fussy, with velvet drapes and lots of fabric, fringe, etc., but the effect -- especially in the lobby -- was to project warmth and coziness. Only real complaints on room are that the sheets were scratchy and bed was kind of hard compared to what you'd find in, say, a nice Hampton Inn. But this didn't detract overly. Internet access, as usual, is an extra cost -- about $10 euros a day, and only usable on one device at a time (you have to buy multiple iterations of $10 euro sessions for more than one device). I cannot understand why nice hotels cannot provide free wifi like the cheapest Motel 6 does nowadays. The hotel amenities were lovely. Outdoor pool is in an enclosed garden type area and is big, clean, and attractive, with lots of lounge chairs and umbrellas around. Only drawback (and this is big if you are traveling with children and touring during the day) is that it closes at 6:00pm. This seemed a frequent situation in our travels in Italy, and is a shame because the best swimming time in my view (and that of my son) is 6-9pm when it's not as hot and the risk of sunburn is much less. New indoor \"Prince\" spa was GORGEOUS. Big, warm pool in a darkish room lit by indirect blue-tinged lighting, and even warmer, huge 'hot tub\" type areas with four or five different massaging mechanisms (chairs that bubble, cascades that massage your shoulders, foot massage areas that you stand in, and a back massage area). Top it off with both hot and cold walking pools that invigorate your leg circulation. Truly lovely and was free for guest use (or at least this was the case the way our reservations were set up via the tour company, Tauck Bridges). There are also various steam rooms and services like massage that we didn't take advantage of. But this was the most beautiful hotel spa area I've ever visited. Food: breakfast buffet lavish and delicious. Many options, including yummy fresh fruits, enjoyed by both 12-year-olds and adults. Only large drawback of this hotel from a tourist's standpoint is that it isn't really in walking distance from much of anything except the Bourghese park and museum. To get to major Rome shopping districts, restaurants, or sights like Trevi Fountain, Piazza de Navona, Pantheon, etc., you are going to have to take a taxi to the tune of about $10 euros each way. This was quite disappointing and made things somewhat challenging for these first-time visitors to Rome. Once you've been there a few days, you figure out that you can walk through the park to Spanish steps and other areas -- but it's a pretty long way. On the plus side, the hotel is in a quiet neighborhood near various embassies and residences, so there is little traffic or street noise.

The purpose of our stay was to relax in and around the hotel and enjoy the spa. My advice to anyone considering this hotel would be to inspect the room you are assigned as soon as you enter. We stayed the first two nights in a standard room overlooking the pool with a balcony. Exceptionally nice view and very comfortable room. 100% 5 star luxury. Unfortunately, there was a leak in our tub, which flooded the bathroom twice (the hotel had told us they fixed the leak each time). For our third night we were switched to a junior suite, which was a nice gesture by the hotel. Unfortunately, the toilet in the suite barely flushed, and our last morning in the hotel there was barely any hot water. We had to take cold showers. We asked that the toilet be repaired but the plumber never showed up. On a more positive note, the spa was amazing and the outdoor swimming pool was beautiful. The spa also has an incredible indoor swiming pool complex. We regularly ate in the hotel and found the dinner restaurant to be excellent and the lunch and bar food much less so (and way too overpriced). Overall, I have given the hotel a 3 out 5 because for the price charged my girlfriend should have been able to take a bath without flooding the bathroom, the toilet should flush and there should be warm water consistently. Also, just a note that the suite did not have a balcony. Stick with the standard rooms. I would not recommend this hotel if your aim is touring as it is very out of the way and more for large groups or for couples who want some quiet time. The staff was always very very helpful. The manager did offer me a discount on my bill because of all of the basic room issues though it amounted to less than $100. Pretty meager considering the several thousand dollars we spent.

It's charming and very Italian. I wouldn't order cappuccino for 6 euro at the restaurant bar unless you are desperate to have caffeine fix right away...but other than that, you can find most things you want around the surrounding area. It's settled on the edge of Villa Borghese residential and diplomatic community. I got cappuccino in the park for about a euro. The Prince Spa is probably what sets this hotel apart from everyone else. It is probably the best spa in Rome. This is my first review I have written on Tripadvisor. I had to say something because this hotel did not get the best reviews in the past. Maybe because they didn't have the spa...and maybe because this hotel is not your typical 5 star hotel. The staff is polite, calm, and elegant. I enjoyed working with Cosimo at the front desk. If you smile and try to communicate to the staff with respect, they will bend over backwards for you. This is not your hot spot hotels. There are no frills in the staff mannerism. If you need something like adapter for your phone charger, they will do their best to find it for you. Just ask politely and calmly. The hotel is moderately priced. Because I packaged it with my plane ticket, I was able to get the hotel for less than $200 per night with tax. That is much less than any 5 star hotel on Veneto. I'd recommend this hotel to those people who want a good night sleep away from the chaos and tourists. If you are into sports, outdoors, and walking, pick this hotel. You get to swim at an incredible indoor pool, workout at the state of the arts gym, run through the most beautiful park in Rome, and walk around the most prestigious neighborhood. Walking through Rome is the best way to see the city. The highlight of this trip was Galleria Borghese next to the hotel. The Cranach exhibit was incredible and the hotel concierge made the reservation for me. There is no glitz and glamor here. If you want that...you will be disappointed. For glitz and show...go to one of the 5 star on Veneto and pay double or triple per night. This hotel is understated, reserved, and quiet.

But I have rarely if ever stayed at a 'proper' 5 star hotel where it is cheap because 5 star should mean great rooms, great service, great food and great facilities - which do not come cheap. Our stay was for 3 nights at \u20ac240 per night and we had several bottled beers, a couple of jars of nuts a coke some water and a bottle of wine from the minibar - total about \u20ac45. We also had breakfast on just one day at \u20ac15 each and a several drinks each night and our total extras bill was only \u20ac200 which I was comfortable with. So having got the cost issue out of the way I can say that we did n ot eat in at all so I can't speak about the food nor did we use the spa - but it looked superb. The room was fine the facilities (TV, balcony etc) good and although the bathroom was a little cramped the toiletries were excellent and it had it all - shower (2 heads) bath, bidet, toilet shaving/make up mirror, lights around the main mirror and so on. Robes and slippers included. The hotel is baroque with very fancy lounges, cornices, mirrors, statues, glass and drapes and the concierges were courteous and spoke great English. We took taxis twice a day to the sights such as the Vatican, Colosseum etc in the morning and then into town to eat and drink in the evening. The hotel is an oasis of peace and calm after the chaos of central Rome and sightseeing in 30 degrees heat. The pool and bar/snack bar is beautiful, never crowded and never populated by leery businessmen - more like the wives topping up their tans while hubby did the deals. Towels and comfy sunbeds a plenty and shades available everywhere. I had no complaints. I was expecting a significant upgrade as agreed with an Amex scheme and also through my travel agent but there were simply no rooms available so tough luck on us. It in no way spoilt our stay and I want to go back for a leisurely week in Rome now we have toured the major sights. Personally I think the hotel and staff had just the right amount of informality and formality, I enjoyed chatting to the barman late at night and the concierges were most helpful. The doormen were perfectly happy to call taxis for guests and never held out their hand for tips. Taxis took no longer than 3 minutes to arrive and varied in cost between \u20ac8 and \u20ac17 depending on how far they came to get you and what time on which day (late Sunday is most costly!) A thoroughly enjoyable stay. The weekend was expensive only because we taxied everywhere (to and from Ciampino airport is \u20ac55 each way) and took guided tours of the Vatican and Colosseum to avoid the 3-hour queues - the tours were about \u20ac50 each and lasted 3-4 hours with qualified and knowledgable guides.

It is a comfortable walk to the centre of Rome through the park , it is quite a small city and the better known visits , Trevi Fountains , Coliseum and Forum , Vittoriano , Spanish Steps etc are a short walkable distance ,if you were slighlty more energetic the Vatican is not far. My 83 year old father with a dodgy knee and damaged foot managed a walk to the centre and back on a hot day . You can walk out of the hotel veer right and then after about 40 yards left at the traffic lights and pick up a bus (tickets need to be purchased in advance from Tabacchi for most buses , although some are carrying machines that take Euro coins , not on routes to this hotel that I found) . There is also the tram system slightly further along the same road but this is a suburban based system that eventually ends up in the centre , you also have to change to get into the centre and seems frequent only at rush hour this far out. Bus numbers to catch are 52 (goes to a small sqaure near Trevi fountains and Vittoriana , 910 goes to train and bus termini in centre , use this for Coliseum etc and I think it was 227 all on same stop. Taxis , if you call a white taxi to the hotel , the doorman will call it for you , they will start the clock as they are called , they often show tarrif 2 when they arrive , ask them to change it to tarrifa uno , just point and say those words you will have the rest of the journey at the correct rate , you may be inclined not to tip them because they have already charged you too much by setting the wrong rate before they get to you. A taxi journey to the railway station (Termini ) is also the bus Termini and will cost about 12 Euro without bags , if you want to pick up a taxi in town the Termini is obvioulsy a good place to ensure no extra charges, about 15 euro with bags and three people. The Hotel is good , you have to remeber you are in a Capital city of the world , services and drinks and food will cost you more , whoever moaned breakfast was 17 odd euro for coffee and croisant , forgot to tell you that was for breakfast in the room . If you are daft enough to book room only you are going to pay highly for meals, but lets face it this is one of the cheapest five stars in Rome just because its set slightly out of the centre in the Emabassy area , so relatively is good value. Take the half board option , the breakfast is magnificent , with so much food you will never be stuck for choice , the fruit is freshly sliced with huge variety , bacon , eggs etc , meats , smoked salmon, sparkling wine ( not a bad one either) , yoghurts , cakes , cereal , fruit juices , bottled water , endless , as was the coffee , tea etc. You can exchange evening meal for lunch if you wish , the set menu for the evening meal does not change , it is fine for a week but beyond that would be a struggle if it does not completely change , only there for a week so I do not know if that happens. To eat in the hotel at night without half board is going to cost you from 24 Euros for dessert , about 35 for main and depending on your inclination one or two starters at about 20 euro, and I emphasise from. The food was good , particularly like the beef in balsamic vinegar , generous portion of fillet sliced , the pork one night was excellent and I should have returned it the next time I had it as it was not of a similar standard, pasta was good , it is not classic Italian food though. Excellent wine list , I judge lists by sampling nearly the cheapest wine to see if it is well chosen, in this case about 30 euro and it was very good , you could spend up to the price of a small car if you wished, even when I wanted just a glass of red they fetched a new bottle , opened it , offered it for tatsing and that is all I had , one large glass for which I was only charged 4 euro and it was very acceptable , not so sure they did not make a mistake on the charge. You always got a glass of free fizz when you were seated plus canapes , endless types of bread an olive oils as required , and very attentive service and attention to detail . Eating at the pool was more expensive than going inside to the bar and there was a slightly wider choice at the pool. Pool is excellent , pool staff will find you beds , lay out towels etc , if you wish. No charges for beds or towels as is the way in some Italian hotels. Decor is much more traditional than modern , oddly the photographs make it look very over the top , but it is better in reality than the pictures , someone described it as Liberace meets Louis XIV , if you like nothing but minimalist modern decor this is not for you. The Spa is not ready yet , but they seem to be spending a lot of money on it . Irons are not provided or allowed in rooms , fire regulations, so if you want laundry and pressing you are going to pay . The front desk is well staffed and they are very helpful and courteous , I suspect it can often be the way you ask that may determine the response you get , but I found them unfailingly polite. As an example I asked them about one missing robe for our room and two for the children plus a flat battery in one of the safes , with fifteen minutes everything was rectified ; one incorrect item on the final bill , which was simply down to my poor Italian , it was swiftly rectified and I left a very satsified customer . Just one pet moan, why do people think it is acceptable to turn up to a restaurant in the evening in shorts or tracksuit bottoms , I am sure they wouldn't like the staff to be dressed as such , I believe it is discourteous .

The Terravision bus cost 8 euros return and after finding the location of the hotel on Google Maps we used it to give us walking directions from the bus station to the hotel. We're both 50 years old but reasonably fit and it took us less than half an hour with our wheely suitcases to walk to the hotel, so no problem and no hassle. When we got to the hotel it was absolutely lovely, with king-size beds freshly turned down every night, a big marble bathroom and a lovely private balcony overlooking the park (and we were only in one of their standard rooms). We had breakfast on the balcony every morning (free remember) and then strolled through the park every day to get to all the main attractions. If you're prepared to walk for half an hour to get to the centre, then this is a delightful place to be. After a long day, we would come back and swim in the pool, sunbathe for a bit and then stroll back into town to choose from one of the many restaurants. Aside from entry fees, the evening meals were our only big expense, but you can get a good meal for two with a bottle of wine for around 40 euros.

We raised our issues with your front of house manager whom tried his best to mitigate the issues, however we felt it prudent to raise the issues with the senior management & expect compensating by our due departure at 6.00am We record our findings as follows; 1. The Spa was not available although advertised on the internet & this was the prime reason we booked this hotel. BEWARE the Spa is not available. 2. The internet in the room or hotel is not free and in a Five Star Hotel it should be. 3. The hotel does not provide an iron or ironing board and therefore forces the guests to use the hotel launry service which is ridiculously over proced. Absolutley disgusting. 4 Items of pressing came to 58 Euro. 4. In order to contact any member of staff for the 'rip off' laundry service it takes no less than '15 minutes' to contact either the front desk, conceirge or house keeping. Awful service. 5. On the first night the fire alam was ringing all night (why?) 6. On the second to last night the whole hotel was without water supply (why?) 7. The service at the pool is a disgrace. The only girl who works is 'Nico' the rest are lazy and ignorant. The food is not garnished and sauces etc are not provided. Service of a 1 star hotel and 24 Euro for 2 x cheese toasties is outragous. 8. The room service food is awful. Tastes like tinned food on a plate & not that of a Five Star hotel. 9. The room was not cleaned properly nor were enough toilet rolls provided throughout the stay. 10. The hotel conceirge booked expensive taxis rather than standard taxis. Note the meter starts on the taxi when the taxi is called and could be upto 10 euro starting price by the time you get in the car. A joke. The items above will be documented on Trip Advisor & other internet sites as the service recieved at the hotel was so bad. The hotel is a disgrace.

We had heard that hotels in the city tended to be noisy, so we were careful to book one that was reportedly quiet. This one was so quiet, so cool, so dark (with its luxe velvet draperies) that we slept for 15 hours our first night (those overnight flights can be brutal, but even by those standards this was pretty outlandish.) The hotel is situated on the edge of the Villa Borghese -- the Central Park of Rome -- and the neighborhood is like the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Embassies, grand estates, etc. All that is fine, but it meant trying to find a little cafe or any other amenities in the neighborhood was a bit of a challenge. We did happen on a lovely street fair on Sunday, while looking for an open tabachi that would sell us bus tickets. We quickly discovered the #52 and #910 buses, which go into town, so during the day, that's a good option for cheap transportation, and you can walk to the Via Veneto in about 15 minutes. But the location is definitely out of the mainstream, so if that's important to you, you may want to look elsewhere. Taxis from centro storico cost about $10. That aside, the hotel itself was gorgeous in a grand style kind of way. Evidently, it's the fave spot for diplomats and even played host to the Beatles in their heyday. The staff is helpful, although the concierge can be a little imperious -- if you're not Madeleine Albright, I guess --- even though two of them boast keys from Les Clefs d\"Or. The pool is spectacular -- think the Hotel Bel Air comes to Rome. A real plus during hot summer mid-afternoons -- and a rarity in an urban hotel. The place has a big conference center, but there's no free wi-fi evidently there's free wifi in the Villa Borghese, but we didn't try it out). There are little rooms where you can connect for about one euro for 3 minutes.

I selected Parco after a TON of reading - my other considerations included all the Westin properties, the Sheraton and the Intercontinential to name a few...plus several smaller up-scale hotels. I opted for Parco mostly due to price, free breakfast, and the larger feel of the hotel (pool, dining room, lounge area). I was very concerned about \"location\" as many people indicated that the location was a negative. The reality --- EVERYONE was impressed and exceptionally satisfied! I'll start with location - my family LOVED the location. The park, which is directly across the street, is a great place to run or walk...or, as my mom experienced...to simply sit and watch the local flavor. You can actually walk thru the park to the heart of Rome. The walking time is about 25 minutes to the Spanish steps moving at a \"city\" walking speed. For those who did not wish to walk - the cab ride is $7 Euro and very easy to catch in both directions. The Parco is located in a quiet and peaceful setting. IT is relaxing to come back to a quiet hotel after a long day in Rome and just relax. Parco offered that each evening. The pool is lovely. The grounds are really very nice. Gelato, expresso, dining are all within 3-7 minutes of strolling. I was VERY happy to be located at this hotel. No complaints at all on location! The rooms - we all had basic \"Superior\" rooms (5 in total). 2 were actually upgraded to Deluxe which offers a park view. ALL the rooms had a balcony and a table with 2 chairs. All rooms had air conditioning which worked very well. Bathrooms were large by Europe standards and well apointed. The rooms vert very clean, well kept, and had a nice Roman charm. I saw nothing \"run down\" -- everything was impecable. Also --- all of our rooms (Floors 5 and 2) were very quiet. I am used to sleeping with ear plugs and found the rooms so quiet that I kept them out! Staff -- some people have noted that the staff is hit or miss. I found EVERYONE to be professional, kind and helpful. They also allowed us to all check in at 11:00 which was great after a long flight. Bar - great selections with outside seating. The inside lobby is lovely. Perfect place to relax at the end of a busy day. Breakfast - very nice in a wonderfully white dining room. Great bonus to have the breakfast! Price - we reserved in January for an end-of-May stay and locked in a rate of 210 Euro inlcuding breakfast and all taxes and fees. No other hotel that I researched could come close. With such a large group, the price really mattered --- so this was a real deal! I have to end by saying that I am very picky when it comes to my accomidations. When traveling without the extended family I always go high end - Ritz, Four Seasons, etc. I always thought of Parco as a family \"compromise\" and a place that I would not return to on my own. After this stay - I would seriously consider ONLY staying that Parco. I was really surprised by the rooms, the location and the staff. One tip -- Parco is a member of iPrefer. Register yourself as a member if you opt to stay here as it may get you an upgrade! Last note -- I thought the spa would be open when we arrived -- it was not!

We didn't chose it and didn't pay, so I can't comment on value for money. The outside belies the lovely decor inside! Personally I really loved the interior of the hotel. It was decorated in the theme of an Italian palace and the art work was all reproductions of all the art you see in the museums and galleries of rome. Much more character than a Hyatt, where you could be anywhere! Would I decorate my bedroom this way, no, but hey when in Rome..... We were upgraded to a suit. I liked the room and the lovely wall of cupboards down our entrance hall. The bathroom was okay. Small with no direct ventilation and the basin/vanity area had no room for your toiletries. The shower was very sensitive, and was over the bath. I liked the heated towel rail and the thick white towels. The suite was done in 2 rooms. One bedroom, one lounge. I did not at all like the decor of the lounge (old green courdroy lounge suite with tassels more reminiscent of an old British pub than Italian Palace) I also didn't like the separate rooms. Had we been travelling with kids, then great, a room for them. But for a couple the space was redundant. Now if they had broken the joining wall down - HUGE potential for a magnificent room! Each room had separate temperature control, although neither worked- the rooms were over heated, and after asking at reception to have it looked at (and it STILL didn't work) we opted to switch it off. The room had lovely thick blackout curtains and was quiet. It had a small balcony, which we didn't use, but could leave the doors open for fresh air. On the upside, let me say that the breakfast (continental) offered by the hotel was DIVINE and the best I have had in Europe! On the down side: Firstly the service. All of the hotel staff (mostly male staff) were terribly cool - and not as in funky, but as in eye rollingly sick of tourists. In the 4 nights we spent at the hotel the only friendly person we encountered was the chamber maid! Secondly, our dinner. We ate one set meal at the hotel, with the conference. It was absolutely awful and by far the worst meal of the trip (and that includes one pretty bad airplane meal!) Thirdly, the location is quite out of the way! Yes, it is a lovely walk through the park to the Spanish steps, but is a good 40 minutes! If you have a lot of sightseeing to do, plan on taking taxis (as the metro is further than spanish steps). Although the pool only opened 1 May, it did look lovely - and in the hot Roman Summer would be wonderful to lie around - if you had a very easy schedule!

We booked a junior suite and a double room for the kids. We got a very warm and friendly reception, and they gave us two lovely rooms adjacent to each other with an interconnecting door. They were on the sixth floor overlooking the park (I think the seventh, top, floor is a bit more special!), both with big balconies for a city hotel. The views were stunning -across the park, over the tops of the trees, to St. Peters. Both rooms were really plush, a bit footballer's wives - which is fine by me. A few frayed edges here and there, but overall very very nice rooms. The restaurant was pretty good, but not fantastic. We stayed half board and discovered that all the half board guests, or perhaps the English ones, are all seated in a separate part of the restaurant. Don't know why, and I can't say it made any difference to us. I would say though that if we hadn't have been half board we probably would only have eaten there once, it's about 30 euros per course minimum and wine ranges from about 35 euros to the price of a small car. As it happened, we ate there twice. The first evening the service was absolutely faultless, prompt food - all four at the same time, friendly and courteous waiting staff all over us, a sommelier who was only too happy to give his time and opinions. We had a great evening. The second time we ate was a bit of a different experience, but it was Easter Sunday, so perhaps the regular staff weren't working. It was very disorganised, the staff were off hand, and the food wasn't great. In other words it was everything that the first night wasn't. This is the only reason I gave 4 for service. In the evenings the beds were turned down, curtains closed, lights down and slippers by the bed. However, the walls aren't that thick, and we could hear most of what went on in the corridoor, not to mention in the couple's room next door. Our showers were quite small, and (minor gripe) didn't have a light in. We discovered a towel in the toilet and a couple of toilet rolls lying around one afternoon when we came back, and a part of the shower door was hanging off, and then disappeared. Hardly the end of the world, and I didn't feel the need to complain, just not quite what you'd expect. Oh, and it's very close to the \"BioPark\", I think it's called, which seems to be some sort of mini zoo. This means that when you open your balcony door you can hear elephants and monkeys and birds screeching. Didn't bother us at all, it's a lot better than traffic - which we heard virtually none of. All in alI I think you get what you pay for, and it is a very nice place. It just felt like it was never quite what you'd expect it to be, almost but not quite. This hotel is cheaper than all the other 5 star hotels in Rome that I looked at. We once stayed in the Regina Baglioni, which is more expensive - and to my mind justifiably so.

So if you plan to be a major tourist and see lots then definitely dont stay here.

As such, I stayed in several five-star hotels (others to the North) and inspected a number of others including some of the grande dames in Rome such as the Hassler, the Splendide (sister property to this one), the Eden, the Majestic, etc. In my view, Parco dei Principi holds up very well to these other luxury properties. Let me address the location issue first. Instead of viewing this as an out of the way location, I actually view the hotel as sitting in an oasis in an otherwise very busy city. The hotel certainly is not located in the center, but the very upscale residential area that it is in is quite peaceful. The view from our rooms over the Villa Borghese to the dome of St. Peter's was memorable. The peace and quiet is a marked contract to what one might encounter walking out of the front door of the Hassler (where one is greeted with a throng of tourists at the top of the Spanish Steps). There are no other hotels in the immediate area, which I prefer. Compare this to the Via Veneto, which is one hotel after the other and a very touristy area (albeit, upscale). Parco dei Principi does offer a free shuttle to the Via Veneto from 10-7 (starting at 9 would be nicer!) and indeed it is a 20 minute walk to Trinite dei Monti at the top of the Spanish Steps. The park is quiet nice. We took about 5 cabs from the center and it was always 10 Euros or less and quick. The exterior of the property is contemporary and a bit ugly. The interior is completely in the classical style. The lobby is quite large and we found the reception staff and the concierge to be quite helpful (realizing that Italians can be rather vague with directions!). The breakfast buffet, included in our rate, was great and one can sit on the ground floor terrace overlooking the gardens and some sort of ruins/old wall. The peace and quiet of this spot was quite enjoyable. Our room was quite nice..no issue with climate control, size, or anything else. I might wish for a bit more color in the decor as it was dominated by gold and green, but that's really a minor comment. The pool was about to open and is quite nice as it is set in the hotel's large garden. The fitness center is much larger than what I saw in any other five-star hotel. Other than emabassies and other residences, there is little to speak of in terms of retail in the area. There are a couple ATMs within 2-3 blocks, which was helpful. On the last night, we actually wanted a local restaurant. We were referred to Casa Mia, an informal Osteria-type spot which actually was one of our finest meals in Rome. While the view was quiet nice, the view from the Eden, the Hassler and the Splendide was better, but one will pay for that. Net, net: I definitely believe this is a five-star property (to counter a couple posts I read). Even if you are only in Rome for 1 night, the cab ride to the center really is quite short and certainly won't break the bank and you will be rewarded with peace and quiet.", "Date": "May 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Acireale, Italy", "Title": "\u201cGood location but not worth the cost.

My wife (at that time, my fiance) and I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights in November of 2006 on the way back to Sicily from the US. Found a good price on a travel website and we were content considering that it was a 5 star in Rome. The hotel is elegant in a certain way but definitely could use some type of renovation. I can certainly understand the desire to keep a classical feel to the place, but there is classical done well and then classical that is just old, and some features of the hotel - especially the rooms - were just old (i.e. furniture). The pool was out of use being November, so I guess we missed out on one of the best parts of the hotel (considering other reviews). The breakfast buffet was included in the price and was adequate but nothing impressive; certainly not indicative of a 5 star hotel. I gave this hotel an overall rating of 3 stars but was debating whether to give it 2. The service was subpar for anywhere and especially for a 5 star place (I know that I continue to harp upon the 5 star rating, but if you pay for 5 stars, you expect 5 stars and you paragon to hotels of similar ratings, right?). There was one young man there from Sardegna who was extremely kind and considerate but some of the others seemed like they were doing you a favor if they provided you with assistance. I am certainly not the typical naive American traveler (I live in Italy, am married to an Italian, speak fluent Italian, etc.), but you wouldn't have been able to tell from the treatment. There was one man in particular behind the front desk who was extremely rude (foreign name; was not Italian). I recall on one occasion that I had just worked out in their small gym and was sweating a little as I crossed through the lobby to go back to my room (there was no shower or changing facility in the gym), and this guy began to criticize me for doing this. I made sure to get in his face about it and he quickly backed down (I am 6'4\" and weight 230 of muscle), but the audacity to even address me about this was ridiculous. Even the recommendations from some of the staff for dinner and that kind of stuff was less than adequate (with the exception of one evening).

Previous reviews on the hotel are both fair and accurate. The mundane exterior of the hotel hides inner opulence in the public areas and to some extent in the bedrooms. We found the conceige service slightly indifferent with no-one really willing to go out of their way more than they had to. Our hotel bedroom was large, very comfortable with excellent air conditioning. Though the bathroom had a bath with shower over and was otherwise well equipped it was pretty pokey in size measuring no more than 6ft x 12ft. Our advice would be to ask for a bedroom overlooking the swimming pool/garden which offers views across Borghese Gardens towards the Vatican and was in sunshire throughout the day. We were notified by the travel company pre arrival that the indoor pool and spa were closed from August to November but as is often the case basically had to go with it! We were however more concerned on arrival to find the hotel shuttle bus had been suspended given comments by others about the 20 minute walk into the city and potential incurring of taxi fares. Again it was very matter of fact - the hotel shuttle isnt working as the driver is on holiday so tough. The town was a 20-25 minute trudge each way to get into the town and with August temperatures of 30c + you were basically lathered with persperation before you even got into the town centre. It may be the time of the year and temperatures but the Borghese Gardens didnt live up to expectation - basically acres of woodland with threadbare grass and huge amounts of graffitti and damage. The park was frequented by more police than tourists probably due to a recent initiative (reported in Sunday Telegraph 10/08/08) to stamp out crime by vagrant communites following a recent murder. Breakfast in the hotel was fairly average with little variety and included standard fare of cold meats/cheeses/fresh fruit salad/fresh fruit. The only hot fare available was scrambled eggs and bacon pre prepared in large metal tureens. Regrettably as we were on half board we were disappointed and surprised that the evening meal menu remained static throughout our stay. Whilst there were options for starter, main course and dessert it soon became pretty repetitive though the quantity and quality was very good. If you are there for only one or two nights or try it as an alternative to eating outside the hotel it would be pretty good albeit quite expensive. Each evening we were given complimentary flutes of Cava to start the meal, and complimentary glasses of dessert wine to end the meal, additionally the waiters provided olive oil from different italian regions to savour with your bread which was a really nice touch especially for someone like us on only their second visit to Italy. In closing quite a good hotel especially if you want a pool and to be away from the chaos of the city in a relatively quite suburb. But be prepared to either hike into town or pay for a taxi if the shuttle isnt running. As far as Rome is concerned I would highly recommend it though be aware of the high temperatures and humidity in August. The Vatican is a must. We travelled from the city centre via Metro (one euro each way) and found the trains very easy to use, quick and clean although as you would expect quite congested at peak times. Separately we took an open top red bus tour having used similar in Paris, but found the Rome version no-where near as good. Though it tours the sights it does so at speed presenting no photo opportunities. We found some difficulty in trying to co-ordinate the audio guide with the sites that you were looking at and more importantly found that once we had got off at a stop we had to walk some 20 minutes to a less popular tourist sites to get back on as they were all full. The red bus clearly feels no obligation to get you back on a bus once they have taken your money and it was only at the 3rd attempt that we got on a bus. Finally for any cat lovers - you MUST visit the cat sanctuary at Torre Argentine situated on the corner of Via Florida and Via Arenula. Free admission between noon and 6pm where you will see the fantastic work of Silvia Viviani and her supporters in caring for the homeless cats of Rome.

My room with a balcony had a view over the pines of the Borghese Gardens across to St Peter's, with spectacular sunsets. The first drawback to the cooler, cleaner, quieter location is that you have a 20 minute walk through Gardens to get to the top of the Via Veneto or the top of the Spanish Steps - but not at night, when a taxi or public transport (easy to use in Rome) is necessary. The other drawback is the lack of dining alternatives close by.

It would be a help if the hotel could stock bus tickets. Otherwise, it was a pleasant 20 minute stroll through the park.

It was large, with a balcony with a great view and a large hand-painted mural on the wall. The food in the restaurant was largely forgettable, and the fitness center was something they should be ashamed of. First, it was about a three minute walk through the cold air from the lobby to get there, which didn't make much difference, since the temperature inside was about 40 degrees Fahrenheit -- they didn't have any heating. The equipment was the worst I've seen anywhere -- the treadmill was so cheap it didn't operate off of electricity. The concierges were the highlight. They looked and acted like ruggedly handsome, middle-aged politicians or movie stars. One bragged that he could get a private jet, ready to go anywhere in the world, in less than an hour. But when it came to getting a ticket to a museum or giving advice as to where to get an electronics part he wasn't much good for anything. He did however provide us with two tickets at 600 Euros each to the New Years festivities at the hotel. These were obtained with great difficulty, after a two day waiting period and after other guests cancelled, because of the great demand for the event. There was to be an orchestra, a 6 course meal, and a fireworks display. Well, it looked like they only had about 30 guests show up for the New Years Spectacular, but room for about 2X that. And the orchestra turned out to be a guy on an electronic organ singing Volare. The highlight of the evening was when my overly uptight, extremely polite girlfriend got drunk and spilled her champagne all over the $3000 dress of a grande Italian dame who was not very pleased to say the least. We ended the evening on our balcony, as fireworks went off throughout the city until about 5:00 AM. There was smoke in the air all night long and it seemed like we were in a war zone.

The food at the pool bar was pleasant but very expensive and the food in the hotel was ok if a little disappointing. It was nonetheless a very nice end to our holiday and we would definitely think of returning. Do make sure that you get a room facing the back of the hotel and preferably towards the centre as the street bins at the side of the hotel are emptied very early in the morning which can be very disturbing.", "Date": "August 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yorkshire", "Title": "\u201cFantastic hotel!\u201d", "Author": "F0rdster", "ReviewID": "UR8121222", "Content": "We stayed 5 nights for our 10th wedding anniversary in June and pushed the boat out by booking a senior suite. When we arrived at 11:00 am) the room was not ready. The reception were very apologetic but I said not too worry as I wouldn't expect the room to be ready at that time. We left out bags and went for a walk around the lovely Borhese gardens which are just behind the hotel. When we returned later in the afternoon the room was ready and we were shown to it. The room was actually a junior suite and not the senior that I had booked so I queried this. The manager explained that the junior suite had a better view (it was at the back of the hotel and looked out over the Borghese gardens to St. Peters). I asked to see the senior suite and this was at the side of the hotel on a lower floor with a not very good view so I decided to take the junior. The senior and junior suites are about the same size, the only difference is that the living room is separate in the senior suites rather than just through an arch in the junior suites so I'd go for the view every time. The room was fantastic with a balcony with a stunning view, a living area, dressing room, sleeping area with huge bed and a gorgeous marble bathroom (actually more like 2 rooms as the shower and double handbasins were in one room which led to another room that contained the bath, toiled and bidet). We also had a lovely oil painting the full length of the wall in the living area The pictures on the hotel website are 100% accurate, the hotel really does look like that and I'd even guess that we had the junior suite that they photographed! We had booked to stay half-board and so ate in the restaurant every evening. We only had to give our name and room number the 1st night and from that point on all the staff recognised us and showed us to our table and knew what we were drinking. They were all very friendly and the service was excellent. The menu is a little limited (no good for vegetarians) but there was enough choice. At the start of the week the food was superb but towards the end it wasn't quite as good so I suspect it was a different chef (the presentation was also not as well done). Breakfast was very good with plenty of choice - scrambled eggs, bacon, cereal, pastries, fruit, yoghurt, etc. Again the service was excellent and the staff would usually remember your tea/coffee order if they had served you previously. As people have said the hotel is a little further from the centre but I believe they run a shuttle bus to the Via Veneto and Spanish Steps. As we like to walk we didn't use this, instead walking through the Borghese Gardens to the Via Veneto and then into the centre. Upon returning home my wife realised she had lost her necklace. I e-mailed the hotel concierge to see if it had been left in the room but didn't expect that it would be found. I received a very prompt reply informing me that they had indeed found it and they put it in the post for me (free of charge!) and we received it back a few days later. I can't recommend this hotel highly enough. The service is excellent and the staff very friendly. I was worried that it would be \"stuck up\" but they treat you like family.", "Date": "July 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Carrickfergus, Northern Ireland", "Title": "\u201cFantastic rooms, bit out from the center\u201d", "Author": "Something-Different!", "ReviewID": "UR8065384", "Content": "This hotel was chosen specifically as it was a special birthday present for my mother.The hotel arranged transportation from the airport for us in a standard Merc. I was pricey at about \u00a360 one way but worth it. The reception staff I found to be courteous, if a little aloof. Our bags were transfers immediately to our room. Upon entering our room you had a long hall way that had a bathroom entrance to one side at at the end what would be the living room. As there were 3 of us sharing, the living room was made into a bedroom with a not too uncomfortable pull down bed.It also had tv, writing desk own minibar etc. I door lead to the main bedroom which was a very good size and had its own entrance to the bathroom. It had full built in wardrobes, tv, another minibar and a king size bed. As we were at the side of the hotel we unfortunately did not have a view over to St Peters (which the rooms at the back do - request this when making your booking). Breakfast was more than adequate, with full range of pastries, cereals, fruits as well as cooked items such as sausage etc. As we had booked the hotel on a half-board basis we ate in their restaurant for 2 nights of our stay (the rest of the time in various restaurants on the Piazza Navarone). The waiting staff were excellent, and although it was not a full al la carte menu, the choice was very good, well presented and very good to eat. The swimming pool was excellent, and also very private. Full marks to the cocktail waiter who even made up his own cocktail for us. All in all, we had a very pleasant stay in this hotel. I would however point our that it is quite some distance from the Via Veneto although it is walkable.

Booked directly with the hotel. When I arrived they had no reservation for me.. wonderful. With this omen I should have said ok and moved to the Via Veneto. 2. Arrived by car (Ferrari). Ignorant doorman only interested in getting hold of my car keys and parking the car. Luggage(expensive) Pulled from the car at an allarming rate and dumped in reception. Other lighter items like camera case, DVD cam pulled from car and dumped on roof of car. So unproffessional. Doorman repromanded and told that if the car roof was scratched I WOULD HOLD HIM responsible. He never spoke to me or my partner again for the next 5 days. 3.Concierge mixed up 3 out of 4 restaurant reservations. I was very specific and even gave him the telephone numbers and address of where I wanted reservations to be made. He was only intrested in \"pushing\" the trattorias he knew( which wern't very many as he lived outside of Rome!!) 4.Pool quite nice but water was hotter than a bath. 5.During my stay there were hordes of Tour bus trips staying. The pool was overrun with screaming (mostly American) teens. I thought I was in summer camp..not what you expect in a..remember...5 Star Lux (and Im quoting their blurb) hotel. 6.Breakfast a disgrace..do not pay extra for it. 7.Hotel restaurant overpriced with very mediocre food. 8.Sat for 20 minutes at the poolside restaurant with 4 staff in attendance waiting to be served let alone greeted on arrival.After nothing happened I went to reception..demanded to see the Hotel Manager and Restaurant Manager. After telling them exactly what I thought of the service in the hotel..guess what. Apot of flowers was ent to the room.......wonderful. I could go on and on but I can not be bothered..if you have any taste at all I would avoid this place. The decor is grand but the service and everything else is woeful. If you are wondering why I booked in the first place. I have stayed at its sister hotel The Splendide Royal which was wonderful but was fully booked for my dates.Just how a 5star should be.

We had our doubts regarding the distance to all the attractions, but it really wasn't any problem. We walked every morning through the beautiful park Villa Borghese - 10 minute walk to Via del Corso. At night we didn't want to walk through the park, so we just got a taxi (between 5 - 8\u20ac from Piazza di Spagna) The breakfast was quite good compared to what you normally get in Italy - a nice, large buffet. I guess we were not the only one to discover this hotel - the first morning we met a lot of policemen in front of the hotel and realized that the players of Manchester United stayed at this hotel after their meeting with Roma in Champions League. Next time we visit Rome, I think we would look for a hotel that is closer to the attractions!
