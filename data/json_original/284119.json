The weather was unseasonally hot (20 - 25dgs C) and I was surprised that the hotel allowed the AC to be on. (there is local governance that AC/Heating can only be on at certain times of year, and AC isn't due to be on til May/June time - it wasn't on in another hotel I moved to in Cannaregio during this trip) The AC unit in my room worked really well, and was a blessing due to the hot weather. Again, everything in my room was lovely. I booked a single but got a very comfortable double. Exceptionally clean, bed very comfy, and nothing worn at all; most stuff and the bathroom looked new. I had a mini fridge in my room, which again was excellent and two windows which looked out onto the little courtyard off reception. I would sit out there in the sun with a book and a cold drink when I came back during the day for a quick rest due to the heat. Lovely!! The towels, like some other hotels I've stayed in, are the thin,white \"tea towel\" type, but they do the job. I'd read the reviews here before my visit, so was aware of what to expect. The location of this hotel is really excellent. Less than a minute walk from San Marco San Zaccaria vap stop, no bridges to cross (although there is a flight of stairs to reach reception, after that there is a lift to the rooms) All staff, especially the ladies who cleaned the rooms, were lovely and very friendly. Reception staff booked me an evening performance at Teatro san Gallo with no problems at all. If your breakfast isn't included in your room rate, then I'd give it a miss, as it was a simple croissant and bread roll with jam, however, the grapefruit and orange juice were fresh! I decided to stay here this trip as I sometimes like to be close to Piazza San Marco as in the evenings, I love to have a Sgroppino at Quadri's and sometimes appreciate after a busy day, having just a short stroll back to my hotel.", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Zurich, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cWorse than you think!

I booked it right after purchasing my Easyjet tickets, I suppose they have a deal going on but in any case this little hotel turned out to be a total gem: 1. Total value for money! We paid less than 100 euros (total) for 2 nights in a double ensuite room. The room was spacious, very clean and because we were on the second floor, our window opened to the rooftops of Venice with the tip of the famous St Marco bell tower visible over them. Below our windows was one of the narrow alleyways of Venice - if you left them open you could listen to the bustle outside and enchanting chatter in Italian by shopkeepers and restaurant owners. Note though, that our offer did not include breakfast, but we were offered the option for 5 euros per person if we so opted. Personally I think it's best to head out and enjoy expresso and a pastry at one of the small coffee places along any of the canals. 2. The room was tidy, clean, and charming. Equipped with all the necessities - a TV, safe, mini-fridge, dressing table, lovely double bed with intricately wired head board. Had two large windows which let in the sun quite a bit in the afternoon (we stayed on the second floor). Hairdryer's not the best though but for the price I think it's amazing already. Basic bar soap and gel shampoo provided, best to bring your own than to rely on it. The only tiny downside was a missing kettle, although you could easily buy hot water downstairs for 5 cents per cup. 3. LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION. If you want to fully enjoy Venice and be drawn into its allure, I think it is crucial to stay on the main island itself. Hotel Antigo Trovatore is even better - it is literally 2 canals/alleys away from St Marco and takes 2 minutes to get there - and along the way you will pass by the lovely Bridge of Sighs. Also easily accessible by water bus (stop: San Zaccaria) if you get lost somewhere in Venice and manage to get hold of a water bus stop. One big plus of staying at the hotel is that you get to catch the early rays hit St Marco square before any of the other hoards of tourists arrive. It is also extremely romantic to wander along the water front which takes 1 minute to arrive at from the hotel. Definitely the best location to indulge in the beauty and charm of Venice. All in all, extremely recommended - because of its amazing location, wonderful value and lovely interior I think my holiday to Venice has been one of the best ever. Absolutely love it, and would recommend to anyone looking for somewhere to stay in Venice.

We had read so much about how expensive Venice is, so when we got an incredibly good deal in this hotel, our expectations were very low. But we were pleasantly surprised. A little tricky to find at first, because it was our first time in Venice, but very central, just by Piazza San Marco. The joy of walking in through the airconditioned entrance! The hotel is clean, roomy and basic, and so was our room. No frills, but good standard, with the very important aircondition. There is an enclosed terrace, where we sat in the evening, enjoying wine we had bought on tap during the day. (Not very classy buying it in PET bottles haha, but very tasty and cheap.) The breakfast was basic, verging on poor. I would definitely stay here again if I got the same sort of deal- we paid 85 euro a night for a double room, breakfast included! I have to add that Venice itself was a positive surprise, I had heard so much about it being expensive, smelly and crammed with tourists. There was no smell at all. Transport is expensive, but buy a travelpass for the boats first thing when you arrive, it makes it easier. (We had 1 1/2 days free travel left on our passes when we were leaving, so we gave them to an arriving couple.) Anyway- you can walk most places, Venice is small, and this is the best way to experience it. There are free maps in the trainstation tourist office- very useful! Don't miss taking the boat over to the island Lido, where there is a long sandy public beach. The water is ment to be dirty, but I don't know how true that is. Venice is full of tourists, but if you just choose the sidestreets it is surprisingly quiet. Food and drink in restaurants is expensive and not great- but the small supermarkets and wine shops are good and cheap! We asked in the hotel for our nearest supermarket, and we bought our water and snacks there cheaply.

The rooms are clean and big(ish) with excellent air conditioning units. For the price you pay you get more than your moneys worth. The only drawback it the flight of stairs at the front leading into the hotel its quite big, so elderly people or people with disabilities may have difficulty accessing the hotel. The breakfasts were good, good selection of breads criossants yoghurts etc. A variety of juices and tea and coffee are avaible also. The big attraction of this hotel has to be the location right in the heart of venice next to the main square, piazza san marco. it takes you less than 5 minutes to walk to san marco from the front door of the hotel. from our balcony in the hotel you could see the campanile (bell tower) and the back of the basilica. When i go back to venice i will definately stay in this hotel Hotel antigo trovatore is fantastic!", "Date": "January 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Western Australia", "Title": "\u201cLocation, location - Antigo Trovatore, Venice\u201d", "Author": "PerthTripper", "ReviewID": "UR4246896", "Content": "Location is everything, and this place is probably the best-located hotel in Venice. The room was small and basic, but very clean and comfortable. It was airconditioned, which was good as there is a fair bit of noise from local cafes. Closing the windows kept out the noise. The staff were very friendly and helpful. As mentioned in other reviews, it is a long steep flight of stairs to the reception, and the lift doesn't stop at every floor. If you are elderly or disabled, that is a major consideration, but for most people it's just a minor niggle. With that proviso, we'd have no hesitation recommending this fine little hotel.", "Date": "December 16, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, England.", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value Hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3803251", "Content": "My husband, daughter and I have just returned back from Venice after staying 4 nights at the 2* Hotel Antigo Trovatore. Usually, we stay in 4*/5* accommodation as we think after working hard all year we want to stay somewhere nice, however, our stay at the hotel was great. Obviously I was apprehensive prior to arriving but I would really recommend the hotel without hesitation. We stayed in room 11 on the 1st floor with 2 windows overlooking the courtyard below. The room itself was simple but had everything we needed and was big enough for all of us. The room also had air-conditioning which was essential in late July. The bathroom was small with shower, toilet, sink & bidet but once again very clean. Towels were provided but as a previous reviewer commented they do resemble a cotton tablecloth (very thin) however they do get you dry! Breakfast was a simple affair of breads with a selection of jam, pate etc, yogurts, fruit juice, coffee, tea, hot chocolate etc. Again, a simple affair but this is a 2* hotel and I have had worse breakfasts in higher rated hotels. The reception staff were great and very helpful. We asked about places to go and Jessica on reception mapped out an itinerary for us which turned out to be really great and was full of useful tips. The major plus about this hotel is the location. You are literally 2 minutes from St Marks Square. The ferry stop (S.Zaccaria) is literally at the end of the street on the Grand Canal. Here you can get a boat to Murano and then on to Burano and Torcello (all recommended). You can also catch a boat to Venice Lido from here which is highly recommended as it has a completely different feel to Venice in that there are great beaches and the whole place is far more relaxed. I suggest you buy a 1, 3 or 7 day pass as they represent good value for money. Also, when you arrive at Marco Polo airport most people get the Alilaguna boat to the centre of Venice. We did this and it dropped us off at the Marco Polo stop which is a 5 minute walk to the hotel (very close) so for ease of travel I would definitely recommend using this service. To sum up I would really recommend the Hotel Antigo Trovatore. We booked through hotelclub.com and paid \u00c2\u00a3322.00 for 4 nights accommodation on a special deal for 3 adults. I think for this price the hotel represented excellent value for money. It is a basic hotel but very clean and with an enviable location (you can see the 5* Danielli Hotel through the front windows of the hotel and the bridge of sighs is in the next street). Venice is an expensive place so if you can find somewhere comfortable like this it just means you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got more money to spend enjoying yourself.", "Date": "August 24, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canberra, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and service\u201d", "Author": "HappyWanderer55", "ReviewID": "UR3473321", "Content": "My family of three adults stayed in a triple room for 2 nights.
