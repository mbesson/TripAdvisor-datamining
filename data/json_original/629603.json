This is a quiet location with plenty of near by shops and restaurants.The locals seem very desperate for tourism since the tsnamui but who can blame them you kind of get followed on the beach by people offering massages.The beach is a good 5 min walk away and is full of locals bathing and socialising- it is a nice sight! They come over and chat frequently!The hotel rooms are lovely, large beds and nice clean bathrooms, equipped with air con and satilitte tv. The balcony's are small but have nice seats to relax in the calm area.The pool is very private with a sunken bar- not many sun loungers though.
