Now, on to the serious problems. Cleanliness: the hallway outside my door was not vacuumed for the 4 days I stayed at the hotel. I know because there was trash of varying sizes -- from very small (pieces of paper and lint) to much larger (several entire tissues wadded up and containing God-knows-what) -- strewn across the hall. Additionally, the trash can outside the elevator on my floor was filled to overflowing and never once emptied during my 4-day stay. Inside the room, a long, dark hair was found within the bed sheets (clearly not mine, as I am bald); and more hair was found inside the tub. The elevator had a relatively large puddle of red soda-like liquid that stayed there as long as I was a guest. State of repair: in a word, the hotel's physical shape is deplorable. To properly close, the door to my room had to be either pushed from the outside to close or pulled from the inside. In either case, the deadbolt did not work as it did not align with the latchplate on the door jamb: that's a bit unnerving. Over the threshold leading into the bathroom there is a thin metal plate that, when stepped on, caused a loud pop. The bathroom door had some kind of trim work running down the length of both sides of the door; however, this trim was curling up at the bottom on both sides. The decorative caps that cover the bolts holding the grip bars in the bathtub would not stay in place and instead continually slid down to the bottom. The trash cans in the breakfast area, which had foot pedals that ostensibly opened the lid, did not work, thus requiring the user to bend down and manually lift the trash lid. The glass front door of the hotel never closes entirely, staying about 8\" open instead. In general: a friend of mine who was staying in another room on a different floor checked out a day early because he saw \"a critter\" scurry across his floor. It takes quite a bit to skeeve me out, but the Best Western Envy managed to do it. The name of the hotel makes me question what anone would envy about someone staying there.

The Hilton was far too expensive so I did my best to find a reasonably priced hotel that wasn't too far a walk away (we did not have a car during this trip.) The Best Western at Envy (BW) showed what turned out to be a very accurate 13 minute walk from the Hilton, stadium and inner harbor. The BW is a small hotel with small rooms. This has never bothered me at any hotel I've stayed in but if you're looking for a lot of space, be aware of that. The staff was polite and helpful and checkin was quick. Love the room keys - you just waved it in front of a panel on the door to unlock. Beware though - there is a small $3 charge for not returning them at the end of your visit. We had a desk, closet, small dresser -- all the typical furnishings of a hotel room. What surprised me was the mini fridge and coffee maker. Both were used on a daily basis! The sink and hairdryer were outside the bathroom -- something I always appreciate -- and we had a large flat screen TV on the wall with a nice selection of channels. Housekeeping came by everyday and we always returned to a tidy room. The breakfast was another surprise. I usually think of a continental breakfast as a smattering of bagels and some coffee. However, we were offered coffee, tea, orange juice, apple juice, yogurt, mini bagels, mini donuts, toast, english muffins, milk, three kinds of cereal, sausage patties and eggs. I was able to have a protein heavy vegetarian breakfast every morning without spending a penny! Even the dining area was pleasant. Loved the free wifi! There is a bus stop directly outside (sometimes leads to a huge crowd right outdoors) and Walgreens and a coffee shopt are right across the street. So - the downside: only one that I can think of and that was the bathroom. The door was a recycled room door (complete with a defunct keycard lock) and was difficult to latch closed. It also creaked and was situated about a metal panel that emitted a loud \"clunk\" when accidentally stepped on.... troublesome when you're sharing a room and trying not to wake the other person when getting up to shower or use the bathroom. But the bathroom door was just one small hangup at an otherwise lovely and affordable hotel; we both very much enjoyed the stay and I would certainly consider staying on a future visit!", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, New Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cgreat deal\u201d", "Author": "henry882", "ReviewID": "UR123299862", "Content": "I stay at the hotel for one night.

When I read all the negative reviews, I figured I would still have an open mind, and that I generally give everyone the benefit of the doubt. That said, spend the extra money and stay somewhere else. There is no parking, and this description isn't very clear about it. The rooms are not clean. A previous guest (let's hope if was the one before me) left some food in the fridge and as a result, the entire room smelled. I politely asked the front desk to arrange for housekeeping to tackle it the next day, was told it would happen but it never did (over a several night stay). Finally, I bought some febreeze and cleaned it myself. Never heard a vacuum running. Fit and finish is what you would expect at the price. There is an odd metal piece of flooring near the bathroom which dents in and out when you walk on it. The rooms are very small, and the air conditioning is lackluster. The elevator was out of order for a good portion of my stay, which can get old when you are on the 6th floor. I see lots of concerns about the neighborhood on here. There are almost always people hanging out in front of the hotel, but they never bothered me or made me feel endangered. The bigger issue for me was that it wasn't really as close to what I came for (Inner harbor, ballgame) as the maps had led me to believe. The staff was never rude, but they always seemed like there was somewhere else they wanted to be (you get what you pay for to a point, but \"not rude\" and \"friendly\" are two completely different things). The front desk is really there to check you in and out, don't expect much else. Nobody books a room at a Best Western expecting the Ritz Carlton.

I walked into this tiny lobby where the night clerk greeted me - by name - apparently I was the only person with reservations who had not checked in yet.

We decided to take a cab to the show because we weren't comfortable walking in this neighborhood so late at night. We got a good night sleep. I was disappointed with the breakfast. It looked like they had the set up for a Deluxe Continental, but there were only breads, a few pieces of fruit and enough cereal for maybe 2 bowls. I think it just wasn't stocked. We were delayed in checking out because they still hadn't straightened out the issue with the Travel Card. The desk clerk seemed inclined to just give it back to me and let me deal with it later. She finally figured it out and we were able to pay the balance and check out. The hotel is nice it's too bad it's not in a better location.", "Date": "January 6, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "BEST WESTERN Plus Envy Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60811-d1950129-Reviews-BEST_WESTERN_Plus_Envy_Hotel-Baltimore_Maryland.html", "Price": "$114 - $193*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">22 E Fayette Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Baltimore</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">MD</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">21202-6422</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1950129", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/2c/df/2cdfb4fc95651e3dfcf2fc670290a9db2large.jpg"}}
