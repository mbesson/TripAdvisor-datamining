It's ideally situated for transport, and just a short walk from the Latin Quarter. Indeed, it's only a 30 minute walk to Notre Dame Cathedral. Although it will take longer if you stroll through the Rue de Mouffetard and it's myriad of cobbled streets and eccentric bars and shops - which is a fundamental reason for being there in the first place. So what's the problem? Why have I given a poor rating? That's because I am rating the Hotel, not the area (which is charming) and the hotel is a smoke and mirrors affair. The staff are surly and distant.There is no \"warmth\" in this establishment. The rooms which are lauded as \"standard\" are basic, and very small. Visitors to mainland Europe can expect small rooms, but this hotel exploits the premise. I booked a double room only to discover that I had two single beds shoved together, and there was barely enough space to accommodate two hand carries. My wife and I travelled light on a short break and we had no large suitcases. So consider this if you have them. There is an elevator, which excuses the employees from assisting you with your luggage, but that is a minor point. There is no shower curtain in the bathroom, as stated by some previous reviewers, but I really didn't know how important this was. The force of the shower is significant, and no matter how you position it whilst standing in the bath, the water goes everywhere. This creates a very wet floor, and to compensate it is necessary to place towels to absorb it, otherwise you will literally be splashing around just to brush your teeth and use the toilet. They have a sign on the bathroom wall which says (roughly translated) that in the interest of the environment, please be sparing with water, conserve your towels, and if you want to change them, leave them in the bath! So why don't they have shower curtains or screens? They must go through a lot of towels. In two days we went through eight, but only because we had to use them to walk on! The rooms have the old large radiators which cannot be individually controlled so the room gets very hot, but fortunately the windows open to alleviate it. I tried fiddling with the thermostat but it was a lost cause. There is only one power point in the room, so bring an extension cable if you have devices that need charging - for example, batteries, phones, laptops. The hotel gives free internet access, but they will take a copy of your passport before giving access codes and passwords. Don't ask me why - by this time I was past caring! There's a tiny flat screen tv situated just under the ceiling at an awkward angle, and has a volume limit barely audible - but that's presumably to ensure that the neighbours don't hear each other - by the way, I forgot to mention the walls are paper thin! The tv remote had not been cleaned, and it wasn't something you would want to handle for very long. The ceiling was cracked, there were unusual bubble formations on it, and all told it was the pits. There was a table but the chair could not extend from it because there was no room - well that's because they tried to make a double room out of a single! So I went to reception and complained and was told I should speak to the manager. The manager wasn't there - and I wasn't surprised. So don't be fooled by the pictures, this is a shocking and poor hotel and there must be far better ones to spend your money with. They do a decent continental breakfast, but you wouldn't expect anything less in Paris. Croissants, yogurt, cereal, ham, etc - but you can get all that and more around any street corner.

There is a grocery store open from 9a.m. until 10p.m. a few doors down, and the Gobelins metro is a few short blocks away (5 minute walk max). Also, the line to Versaille is just a 10-15 minute walk. Several cafe's, restaurant's and Bakeries all within a few minute walk. Overall I would certainly recommend this hotel. It's not in the heart of the city, but it is in a great, clean, working class neighboorhood.", "Date": "June 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cQuiet escape in a real part of Paris\u201d", "Author": "ruvb", "ReviewID": "UR113112999", "Content": "This was our first time in Paris, and we were a bit apprehensive about staying in such a residential area (just because we weren't 100% sure on how it would be getting around and such). However, we were pleasantly surprised at how much we enjoyed coming back to the Logis Grand Hotel des Gobelins every evening. The metro stop was fairly close, and there are countless great restaurants and bakeries along Saint Marcel and Rue Gobelins. We loved the view of adorable Parisian apartment buildings through our window - we were on the top floor of the hotel so it was definitely the best. The area is busy around the restaurants, but quiet and very conducive to a good sleep. Breakfast was more than the standard Parisian breakfast (based on what friends had told us it generally is) - the croissants and mini-baguettes were delicious, and the yoghurt, fruits, and jams were nice, too. Staff were all helpful, from the front desk down to the cleaning. Our room was clean, bright, comfortable, and a good size for the two of us. The only issues we had were, like with most other reviewers, with the lack of shower coverage (so it was a little inconvenient to wipe down the floor after every shower) and with having to leave the keys at the front desk before leaving the hotel. They never asked us for ID when we came to pick up our key upon our return, so as North Americans used to more security measures it was a bit worrisome (but I guess in the 13ieme they don't have these kinds of problems?). Another comment about the area is that there is nowhere to exchange money around there, so ensure you do it before arrival or look out for an exchange bureau in the touristy areas (i.e. Rue du Rivoli). Finally, we really appreciated the nicer smells of the area as compared to much of tourist Paris. I will take bakeries and restaurant food wafting around over goodness knows what that we smelled in the parks and subways any day!", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Truro, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201csuch a great place to stay, you know your in Paris.\u201d", "Author": "kel_and_one", "ReviewID": "UR103672907", "Content": "Fantastic stay, with my mum celebrating mothers day and my birthday.

The hotel is about 300metres from the metro which will take you straight to the Louvre if that's your thing - otherwise change at Chatelet for anywhere else. My wife insists that I mention the magical atmosphere of the Rue Moufetard in the evenings. Service - charmingly French and helpful. Room service will not touch your room unless you put a card on the door which is fine by me! Rooms - I have stayed in plenty of hotels across Europe and for a city centre these are good. Small by American standards but quite usable. Ours had a bath / shower combo which was great and there was a room safe for valuables. The door key deadlocks the room so you turn it twice clockwise - seems some of our Colonial cousins have a problem with this! Leaving the key at reception means you don't lose it so, hey, that's a good thing. There is only air con on the top floor so this is a place best visited in autumn through to spring - the rooms are triple glazed and so quiet and warm in winter. Breakfast - A good French breakfast! For a start you get croissants and believe me not a lot of French hotels provide those. The bread is fresh, there are meats, cheeses, yoghurts, fruit, juices and cereals - you can really fill up for a good start to the day - and of course the coffee has the kick of a mule, unlike the dishwater served in some American hotels. definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a short (romantic) break.", "Date": "February 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hornchurch", "Title": "\u201cRomantic typically french hotel\u201d", "Author": "Cher2011", "ReviewID": "UR91140269", "Content": "My boyfriend took me to Paris for my 20th birthday was a lovely surprise, hotel was very quaint and so very French, room although quite small looked like a scene from an old french film with lovely windows opening out onto the quiet street and a brilliant view of Paris (even the eiffel tower can be seen).

Okay, first off, we arrived at this hotel pretty tired. The rooms still require an actual old fashioned key to unlock the door and the struggle to unlock the door was aggravated my wrist twisting it this way and that. When we came down we were rudely informed that the key stays there and that is always the way it's done in France. Basically the guy said, \"This is France\". I felt unsophisticated and stupid by this remark. I almost wanted to retort, Gee really? I thought we were in Germany. Anyway, the first day when housekeeping cleaned our room, she took the fan (there is no air conditioning) and all our towels. The receptionist at night seemed indifferent and acted as if we were being pests. But it was unusually warm in Paris and the rooms were stuffy and unventilated. It was a horrid mess. So, now we couldn't shower and couldn't cool down. Also, I was trying to get a bottle of water for my friend whom was sick and queasy from the trip in the overly warm room...of course paying for the extra bottle and I had to wait while the guy chatted away at the Front desk on a personal call. I took some French so I understood some of his conversation. I hated my stay there. My best day and I was giddy at it, was when we took the train back to London. I don't care about the small rooms but the rudeness of the staff gave me a bad feeling and now I have to think twice of whether I will ever go back to Paris again.

BEST shower in Europe! Glass-enclosed, so no water on floor, but marvelously hot water combined with incredible shower pressure: WAY beyond what I've come to expect.

We resorted to kneeling in the bath when showering to minimise the deluge. We don't know if this is the same in other bathrooms.

Advertised as a 3 star hotel and this is about right I would said. We had booked a standard room and I have to say I was a little disappointed with the room when we arrived. The decor was not great, it didn't feel totally clean. As many have said there was no shower curtain so water got everywhere in the bathroom. Also there was a lack of storage space in the room for clothes. I hate living out of a suitcase and have to unpack everything so we had to be quite creative with where we stored everything. After two nights in this room we were about to head out for the door and were dropping our keys off at reception when we were told that the wardrobe in our room was to be replaced (obviously they were aware of the lack of storage problem!) today. Would we like to move to a room that is exactly the same? There was no apology for the inconvenience of suddenly having to go back upstairs and pack up all our things. After it became clear that this wasn't a request we could turn down we hesitated just the right amount of time for them to also offer us an upgrade to a superior room. To be honest, I would have expected this straight away. So we moved. This was a much better room. Much more space. Nicer bathroom, more storage, better decor. I don't know how much more expensive this room was but I would rate this room as a 3.5 star room whereas the first was about 2.5. If you can I would recommend booking a superior room, it felt much more comfortable. Again, just a fan. No air con but it wasn't that hot anyway. Breakfasts were fine. After a week we were a bit bored of them but I've certainly had much much worse. Front desk were friendly. Location was great. The metro had direct links to the Louvre, Notre Dame (to name just two) and everywhere else was just one change away.

The room was quiet with a lovely traditional window overlooking the boulevard.The regular sirens from the police vehicles can become irritating but that is a general Paris thing not specific to this area. In fact at the weekend, it is fairly quiet. The staff are very pleasant and friendly. Breakfast is in a small room , not the choice of a large hotel but perfectly adequate. The hotel is in a non touristy location but not too far from a few metro stations and the batobus stop at Jardins des Plants. There are not many local restaurants but the (mentioned elsewhere) Au Bon Coin complete with checked tablecloths, is a must, very good food and nice staff who will explain the menu if you dont understand it all. Very French and we walked in on a sing song complete with accordion player which seemed private but never were we made to feel anything other than welcome and at home. There is a pleasant bar on the corner of the Rue des Gobelins, and also a very good Italian nearby (need to get there before 7.30pm or you will be in a queue). The food is good here but quite expensive, nearer to London prices. Beer is 7-8 euros a pint generally and wine can cost more than at home! The exchange rate doesn't help of course. Paris is as beautiful as ever but a lot of restaurants are touristy and seem cheap but the food is poor compared to UK standards and service very rushed to the point of pushing you out the door as fast as possible. The days of sitting outside a cafe watching the world go by seem to be over in the centre of the city which is a shame.

The room we had on the fifth floor overlooking the main steet was very nice, double bed and a small single tucked in the corner, good views out over the Paris rooftops and a glimpse of the Eiffel tower between the buildings opposite. very quiet at night, with double glazed windows and heavy drapes. the bathroom very clean and roomy +separate toilet. The breakfast room is a complete joke, about 15 of us crammed in a room lined up with our little dishes and plates, then after you squeeze your way back to the table you have to do it all again to fill your coffee cup, forget it ! walk down the hill to the main intersection at Blvd St Marcel and on the right is a beautiful boulangerie. The latin qtr is about a ten minute stroll, you can walk down to the Siene in about twenty five minutes, and the same time will get you via blvd Port Royal to Montparnasse. The Parisien people really were delightful, offering advice to us if we were perusing bus /metro timetables, and even if we began the query in French they would if they could switch to English, or direct us with smiles and gestures in French. Altogether a fantastic experience, one that i know we will repeat in the near future. I would certainly use Les Gobelins again, apart from the breakfast room it has a lot of plus points. The area around it is very safe, and relatively quiet after the hustle and bustle of the main tourist spots it was nice to get back to the area at night and relax in one of the bars/ retaurants, and prices a lot lower than the touristy spots too.

Staff were friendly and efficient, and breakfast was good value although with the many cafes/patisseries around I'd recommend going out. Location is on the edge of the Latin Quarter/St Germain, and is an ideal base to explore the 'real' Paris away from the tourist traps around the main sites. Metro stop 'Le Gobelins' is 5-10 mins walk to take you anywhere you want to go in Paris. There are many cafes, restaurants, bars in this area so perfect for people watching.

We had 5 nights at Le Grand Hotel des Gobelins-our first time in France.

Our room was large enough to comfortably fit a queen sized bed and a single bed.The bathroom was modern and super clean with a powerful shower. And after a big day wandering the exquisite Parisian streets it was such a treat to soak in a big bathtub! Despite staying in a front room of this hotel, it was incredibly quiet at night. Breakfast was delicious- plenty of variety. The reception staff were particularly charming and informative. As for location: a local supermarket is just a few shops down. The closest metro station is just a quick 5min walk away and it was wonderful for the three of us to be soaking up the sights, sounds and tastes of the Rue Mouffetard within just a 10 minute walk from the hotel.

I was traveling alone and the neighborhood is very safe, clean, and attractive. I was pleased that the hotel's own website was set-up to accept reservations. Without having to go through a third-party, I felt more confidence in my reservation confirmation, which was emailed to me within 6 hours of my making the reservation on-line. The room rate was phenomenal - 85 euros a night for a room with a double bed. My room was small (if you want a large room, plan to stay at a 4 or 5 star hotel and pay plenty), but it was clean and very serviceable. The bathroom was also small but private, with a stand-up shower, great water pressure and an adjustable sliding shower head (I'm rather short so this was very nice). I had room #35, a corner room with two windows. Even with the busy street below one of my windows, it was peaceful at night. True, the hotel is not near big touristy attractions, but it is near some very quaint neighborhoods. The Les Gobelins metro stop is just down the block and can get you across town very easily. As others have mentioned, there is a Champion food store (a more American type grocery store) just a few doors away from the hotel. La Mouff - a fabulous market street is a quick walk north on Avenue Gobelins. The staff was very helpful. The gentleman who works during the day speaks excellent English and is extremely helpful. One of the night workers was less fluent in English and didn't appear too helpful, but other than that the staff was great. I did not have the breakfast at the hotel. Honestly, it confuses me why anyone would. For a short stroll down the street or to the aforementioned La Mouff, there are patisseries, boulangeries, and cafes abounding. Also, don't expect to get any ice! Not just at the hotel, but anywhere.

The hotel: The hotel is very charming and even though there is a road directly in front of it, we found that we could not hear the traffic at all and that we had a very good nights sleep. The entrence hall is very nice and the rooms are of a good size for Paris. We found the bed very comfortable and the room very clean and tidy. The rooms are nicely decorated and the staff are very pleasent and helpful. Staff: Staff were very helpful and the guy at recption was always ready to help us out and made us feel very welcome. The rooms: We were very impressed with the rooms. They were very clean and we were not dissapointed in any way. There is a desk and chair as well as an LCD television and enough space to hang up coats / clothes. Television has a range of French and English channels. We wanted a good bathroom and this one was very good. With a nice bath that had great water flow and tiles that looked brand new, it was really clean. Bathroom came with lot's of towels, soap, shampoo. Well stocked. Also has a a hairdryer. The view from the windows will depend where you are. From tof the hotel willlet you see the Eiffeltower in the distance and the Pantheon. The rear windows give on to the inner courtyard. Location: This hotel is in a great location and there is a Metro station just at the end of the road. About 7 minutes walk. Although you can walk into central Paris, it is quite a way on foot and although you can do it, it isnt too easy if you have lot's of luggage with you. Just take a metro from just down the road. Eating out: You can have breakfast in the breakfast room although we decided to head out early and a few doors down the road (on the opposite side of the road) there is a lovely boulangerie where you can get fresh croicesants, bread, Chocolate cakes, etc....... A must if you are coming to stay in France. Just down the road (about 5 minutes walk) you will also find a \"Champion\" supermarket. Getting back at night: The hotel is open late and you can easily stay out late in Paris. Do remember that the Paris Metro will have it's last train around 1.30am. There is however a night bus that you can catch that goes very close to Les Gobelins and once you get off, the hotel is about 10 minutes walk. Useful for when you realise you need to get back and it is very late. We found the area quite safe. Overall impression: If you don't mind catching a tube into central Paris and a little walking then this hotel is the one for you. Very nice rooms and helpful staff, this was a very pleasent stay.", "Date": "February 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel\u201d", "Author": "LAKELK", "ReviewID": "UR5528116", "Content": "I stayed here for two weeks in July of 2006.
