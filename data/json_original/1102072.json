The location isn't very picturesque, but it's very convenient for meetings or activities downtown. The closest subway station is only a 10 minute walk from there. I found the service very efficient and friendly. I had a room with a queen bed on the 12th floor. It was on the small side, but very modern and clean. The bathroom was immaculate. The breakfast was fine though not extraordinary - a few muffins, juice boxes, coffee. I paid 139 CAD + taxes for 1 night, a decent price for such a hotel.

On the first night, the cops and fire trucks were going past the main road like 4-6 times until 11pm, then it stopped. Second night, road was quiet other than a few car horns here and there until about 9pm. Third night, not a peep. Now, I'm not sure if it was because we got lucky or if there's some sort of noise restriction on the main road during the night. - One morning the elevator was locked, no matter how many times we pressed the button, wouldn't work, so took the emergency exit. There are two exits, the first one we took, we couldn't open the door leading out to the lobby and now window on the door either. So, we went up to level 3 (level 2's door was locked) and used the other exit, this time it the door to the lobby was unlocked, so we got out, just concerns me a little bit that one emergency exit can be opened. - Valet parking is $23 - Our towels were bit weird, one was thicker than the other, so I always jostled with hubby to get the thicker one Tip: Also, the first night our aircon cycle in and out, because we set the temp at 20degC, we could not get a sleep at all. Our trick so that it's on all the time is to set the temperature at 16degC, the aircon will try to get the temp down to that but won't because it looks like it's set to maintain temp at 20degC, so it will stay on all the time Verdict: Love the hotel, love the location, hate the valet parking fee (but necessary), hate the noise. I'd probably come back if they give me a higher level room not facing the road.", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dalhousie, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value, Downtown Mtl.\u201d", "Author": "Derek L", "ReviewID": "UR125927405", "Content": "Great hotel, if you don't mind cozy little rooms.

We got a great deal on this hotel, so we didn't go in with high expectations. To our surprise it was one of our best experiences. The rooms have a very industrial modern look. The hotel is small and has a very intimate feel about it. It is nicely decorated in dark tones and wood, with large windows that give you a great view of Chinatown. It is very trendy without being pretentious. The staff was extremely friendly and spoke both English and French (seemed to be alot of vistors from Europe at the time we stayed and they too enjoyed their experience). We had a LOFT suite room right off the elevator on the 9th floor (didn't hear elevator at all). Had a living room area, wall unit, table and then the bed. It was well equipped (Hidden fridge, sink, microwave, real wine glasses, plates and cutlery \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which all came in handy for our takeout food we ate in our room. Coffee maker,(2) LCD TVs, and an alarm clock with an IPOD adaptor.) The bathroom was very nice (shower only \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no bathtub), the bed was very comfortable, and we had a great view. It had everything we needed and we loved hanging out in the room between activities. So close to Chinatown and Old Montreal. Only downside in the suites it would have been nice to have bathrobes and because we stayed in the winter, and the rooms have dark wood floors when we walked into room with our boots \u00e2\u20ac\u201c salt was left behind.

We called reception and they told us the technical support had gone home for the evening, but that we could switch rooms. We didn't really want to pack up everything and switch at midnight so we just stayed in our room.

I thought they did alot with the little space that they have. Check-in was fast and efficient, no problems at all. The room was clean, and comfortable. The only issue i had with the room was the shower. Its rectangular shaped, with the shower head on the long wall, meaning if you facing the shower, your back is almost against the wall.

When we first arrived though, all the spaces in front (20 min max, hotel guests only) were full (which was weird considering there was no one else checking in) so we had to drive in circles to wait for one to free up, and ended up parking illegally!

Each room has cable TV, a kitchenette with a microwave, fridge, coffee maker (horrible filtered coffee though, but coffee and muffins are available every morning downstairs almost makes up for it), and its own WIFI router, meaning you can get excellent Internet for free here without it being like free Internet in other hotels where it works so long as your laptop is in the lobby or near the room's door. The staff were friendly but a little detached at times, and we had some concerns given the \"seedy\" look of the area (the \"Quartier des spectacles\" is being heavily renovated, it seems) and the fact that the staff often don't seem to even acknowledge your existence as you enter the hotel later at night, but we didn't have a single problem. Bonus points must be awarded for the Couche-Tard (a 24-hour convenience store) located in the same building but on the rear. If you're looking for something more substantial, there's an IGA supermarket in a part of the underground city just west of here a couple of blocks too. Given Montreal's fantastic restaurants I don't know why you'd want to microwave something to eat in the room (we didn't). The hotel's location is perfect - Saint Laurant metro station is five minute's walk (about 10 minutes for Place-d'Armes metro if you prefer), rue Sainte-Catherine Ouest starts at half that distance, China Town starts just across the road (including the excellent Restaurant Beijing, again roughly five minute's walk), and the bus stop for the 747 bus to the airport is practically at the door-step. Take a look on Street-View! The hotel has clearly gone through (and is still going through) a large scale renovation from their old apartment-hotel formula (ignore the horrible looking photos on older reviews), as the rooms are very modern and ours was thoughtfully arranged to utilise the small space efficiently, and they're still working on a new restaurant for the hotel on the ground floor. We did have some minor hammer-drill noise at around 7am on two mornings during our stay (we were awake anyway), but otherwise the rooms really are very sound-proof. As with every hotel I've been to, the room's air-conditioner is too noisy to leave on for very long (and certainly not while sleeping), but the huge advantage here is that the windows can be opened! Other hotels could learn from this, and the fresh air was very welcome. Our room overlooked Boulevard Ren\u00c3\u00a9 L\u00c3\u00a9vesque so we had to close this at night to keep the noise out, but it was pretty quiet (the windows are double-glazed so it's a very minor din, as can be expected down-town). The sound proofing is very good, and we didn't hear a peep from neighbouring rooms (and we even saw lots of loud girls potentially on a hen-night arrive in two limousines, so we \"knew\" we'd have a rough night, and still we heard nothing). However, it doesn't allow for much airflow, and unfortunately our room was very dusty. The floors, tables, and even the chairs were very dusty, and the room had a distinct dry, dusty smell.

A light breakfast is provided in the lobby each morning, the WiFi is free and on top of this the Airport 747 Express Bus to downtown stops right beside the hotel ($8 - One way trip direct to airport, about 30mins).

The gym is small but provides the basic essentials. There are lots of meeting rooms here if you are planning a conference or event.

There were only two plastic seats and a small table in the room. no real chairs to relax in, no desk, a very low table with a missing leg serving as the only piece of furniture to store something on, a very small closet not full height, suitable for one person. No coat rack or at least some hooks at the entrance- that was really a big miss. The laminate flooring was cheap and squeaky, the only rug in the room was the one they use at the Mall entrance.The most idiotic thing was the location of the wall mounted TV, right in the small entry hallway, across the bathroom, 16ft away from the bed and the plastic chairs.

Having stayed at 75+ hotels since 2007, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Le 1\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is easily the worst on the list. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the lowdown: Pros: Right on the doorstep to Chinatown. Nice outdoor sitting area on the 5th floor. Some rooms (floors 10-12 on the south side) will have a decent view of Chinatown. Kitchenette was a nice idea; I appreciated the mini-fridge and large work table. Good shower pressure and hot water came within 15 seconds. Windows provide moderate soundproofing from the street. Cons: This is the noisiest hotel I have ever stayed at, and sadly, it could have all been avoided with some common sense from the hotel. There is massive construction going on throughout the 2nd floor. They are ripping the concrete apart and installing new concrete walls for new condos. It starts at 8AM sharp and continues until 7PM. Intense non-stop drilling sounds like someone is using a chainsaw in your room, even several floors above. For a moment I thought this was a practical joke. I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even hear the TV at full volume. Any normal hotel that values customer satisfaction would be closed for this level of construction. Given the degree of work ahead as of May 2010, I would expect the project to continue until at least late 2010, though likely well into 2011. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED: Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect much sleep anytime in 2010 at this place. Even with earplugs, I left with a sore back and a massive headache. With the big dig of Ste. Catherine, much of the traffic is re-routed to Rene Levesque, where all four lanes of the main street directly in front of the hotel are extremely busy all hours of the day; expect to hear a plethora of horns and sirens, especially if you are unlucky enough to be on the lower floors. I would advise the owner and staff to try sleeping in their hotel to get a sense for the misery their customers must face. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be fooled by the (misleading) curb appeal and renovated lobby; there is absolutely ZERO comfort here. In fact, virtually everything seems to be intentionally designed to make a person want to leave the moment they arrive! Requested a quiet room with a view of Chinatown on a slow day and was given the 4th floor. Check-in was very slow and has a bizarre room contract, which among other things states that no parking service is provided; you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on your own finding a spot, and given the sketchy area, you will be facing a hike in finding a safe place. The hotel is surrounded by an unsavory blend of shady beggars, hardened inner-city youth and vagrants who camp out 24/7. With all the dark alleys and red light district nearby, walking alone at night would not be recommended here. Absolutely no functionality or practicality in the rooms here. Room itself resembles a hospital; concrete walls and ceiling (some painted, some not, much of it chipped), cold tiled floors that have been dusted but not thoroughly cleaned in weeks, coupled with a vague, musty smell. Only one (!) towel provided. One large, lumpy pillow. Sheets are dated, paper-thin and falling apart. Bed cover looks to be 30 years old. No alarm clock. Poor lighting. One small bar of soap provided. No information on hotel services (which are minimal, though I did find the neat patio on the 5th floor and PCs/washers/dryers and a foosball table on the 6th), no channel guide, no maps or magazines of Montreal etc. Tiny 1980s 13\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd no-name TV in far corner is unwatchable from the bed; thus can only be seen from the one hard, uncomfortable plastic chair. Total new value of all in-room furniture would be around $75; with economies of scale, Le 1 would have paid much less. Oddly, each room has a full-sized dishwasher for the ONE spoon, fork, knife, cup and bowl provided. In 2010, how remarkably environmentally unfriendly, not to mention illogical. Given the profound lack of comfort, you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to eat in your room anyways. No iron. No drawers for clothes. Mold and cracking tiles in bathtub. Arrived to a boiling-hot room set at 24 degrees, but quickly learned why. Upon setting it to a normal 21 degrees, the room was absolutely freezing at night, rendering the unit completely ineffective. Impractical translucent light beige blinds allow in 90% of the light, meaning your room will be bright and heating up quickly at the crack of dawn, and all south beds are arranged such that they directly face the sun. No eatery in the hotel, and nothing within the block. This is as basic and no-frills as a hotel gets. Lobby is very tight; if anyone is checking in or out, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be dodging their bags to get to the one lone elevator that services 12 floors (notice the minimalist ONE of everything theme at Le 1?). Vibrant downtown nightlife is 15 blocks west, or a good 30-minute walk. At an average rate of $122, this is remarkably poor value for your money for what is essentially an uncomfortable hostel. I have a hard time figuring out why there are so many positive reviews here; from what I saw at Le 1, it would seem that many are backpacking/student/budget travelers with modest standards. My advice? Pay the extra $20-40 (yes, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all, and in some cases less) and stay at one of Montreal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s many beautiful 3-4 star hotels.", "Date": "August 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa", "Title": "\u201cA strange place - but a good experience\u201d", "Author": "OttawaAli", "ReviewID": "UR71050516", "Content": "Stayed overnight in a Studio room with a single bed as was attending the Just for Laughs Festival.

ROOMS Besides having to use a single bed for two people, the room was just right. It was very clean and we had an awesome view of the city (specifically Chinatown and the taller buildings near Old Montreal). The room had a mini kitchen (stove, microwave and fridge) with cutlery and pots/dishes which was very convenient for us since we wanted to save money by eating in. There is also a Mac's convenient store downstairs and an IGA grocery store half a block away where you can buy food also. There is a nice terrace on the 5th floor where you can smoke and simply hang out. With the beautiful weather this weekend, we were on there a lot having a smoke, a drink, and playing cards (since there are tables and chairs too). Note, there are only TWO elevators which can both be slow at times. If you are impatient when it comes to waiting for an elevator, suggest for a lower floor or at least floor 5 or 7 (trust me/// once you're there, you'll know why). BOOKING My boyfriend and I had booked a Studio A room with a single bed and thought we could request for a room with 2 single beds (to make it into a double bed). Unfortunately, we were unable to get a room with 2 single beds because the hotel was fully booked. My ADVICE is when you're booking online MAKE SURE you are aware of what kind of bed is given to you especially if you're not travelling alone! However we managed to stay in a room with the single bed, and for the price, we thought it was a good value. SERVICE The front desk staff were very accomodating, helpful, and friendly. I've stayed in many hotels (franchise ones too) and this concierge staff was probably the best I've ever encountered with. They were very understanding and considerate. You knew that they genuinely wanted to make your stay the most confortable and pleasant experience. They answered questions with care and tried their hardest to accomodate to any request we made. Their service went above and beyond e,specially for a 2 star hotel. LOCATION It is right across from Montreal's Chinatown and about a 10 min walk from the Old Port. It is on St. Laurent Ave which has a lot of strip clubs and bars/clubs around. It is very close to the busy streets such as St. Catherines and Crescent St. If you want to party and be close to the parties, this place is a good location for that. It is also close to tourist areas. THERE IS NO PARKING IN THE BUILDING. The closest and SAFEST parking is about half a block away in an underground which isn't free either. One warning about this location is that there are a lot of panhandlers that hang around this area, but they seemed harmless for the most part. OVERALL I would go back to this hotel if I planned to go to Montreal again because of the value, the very central location to downtown, and for the customer service.

As the title of my review says, the hotel is exactly as advertised on their website. It is a very basic, but also a very clean hotel. The room may have been small but I value cleanliness and this hotel delivered on that. I did my research before booking this place and I must say, other hotels in this price range were horribly outdated and unkept. Here are a few things that really stood out about this hotel: (1) Very clean and modern (2) Nice TV with channels in both English and French (3) Free high-speed internet connection (4) Good-size bathroom (5) Refrigerator inevery room (6) Comfortable bed (7) Large windows that open for fresh air (8) Short walk to Old Montreal and St. Catherine St (plenty of resturaunts and bars nearby) Here are a couple things that you may want to take into consideration before booking: (1) The room really is very small, so if you are considering spending a lot of time in the room relaxing, I would consider another place (2) Our room was on the 4th floor facing a park behind the hotel...while this was nice during the day, at night it was noisy with seedy people - druggies etc. Consider getting a room on an upper floor to ensure a quiet's night sleep (3) Because its such a great price, dont expect any other amenities that you might find at other hotels. Overall, if I were to come back to Montreal, I would stay here again. Also, just a note about the city itself...while the city is certainly steeped in history and clean...I must admit that I was taken-back by the amount of homeless people and druggies wondering around the streets. In the evening, it was not uncommon for me to literally see people shooting up right there in plain view on major streets. While I never felt threatened by them, it did deter from the overall charm of the city. Also, make sure you park your car in a secure parking lot...walking around each morning I noticed more than a few cars with broken-out windows. Lastly, families travelling up to Montreal with children should consider the fact that explicit sex-shops are all along St. Catherine St. Considering that many of the city's restaurants and shops are along this street, this may be a factor in planning your trip. If this is a concern for anyone, consider travelling the extra distance up to Old City Quebec -- you cant beat the experience!

However, directly behind the hotel is a shady little park with shady little characters. While most of the neighborhood is graffiti free, their artistic and creative efforts are directed at the walls surrounding the park. The park, on Boulevard Saint-Laurent is a neighborhood in transition. The first two blocks behind the hotel are a mixed bag of small sex shops in a mini-red light district, complete with the gawkers who frequent these locations. However, once you get past these two short blocks, Saint Laurent opens up to cafes, shops, creative art spaces and a more dynamic and eclectic community. The hotel is a converted storage building for the College of Montreal, and was renovated in to a hotel two years ago. The hotel is modern minimalist, however the modern minimalist approach doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear to be modern-durable, as the furniture already shows signs of wear.

And the ethernet cable didn't actually reach from the plug to the desk. The cable arrived, but for the air, I waited. And despite assurances that some one was coming, I waited. Even though I said that I would have to go out at a particular time, I waited more. I spoke to four different people, and finally when I showed up in the lobby with my bags packed, I was efficiently whisked to another room. The rooms themselves are very plain, small, functional ex-dorm type with chipped basic furniture, unplastered ceilings, and a bare bones kitchenette. They were basically clean (except for the fossilized grease on the kitchen knife). Cleaning during my stay was haphazard however. One day I didn't get any soap, so I used my own. The next day my (nice, clearly non-hotel) soap was thrown out, and replaced with little disposable ones. But that only happened when I called at 7 pm because, after a day out, my room still hadn't been made up, despite the \"please clean room\" sign on the door. Another detail: there is only one elevator per stairwell, which means that when some rude guest holds the doors, there is no ther way up. (I didn't feel like walking up 11 floors.)

Le 1 Rene Levesque was very clean, with nice, modern decor. The price was under $90 per night, and we \"splurged\" for the C suite. I would say it is probably worth it for the space. The room was clean and the linens and furniture were modern and new looking. The view out of our 11th floor room was very nice and the shades worked well at night. The AC was very adjustable and the room was nice and cool. All of the front desk gentlemen were friendly and helpful. There were no problems with our reservation or room. The location was central to so much. We walked to where the jazz fest was setting up, up St. Laurent to the nice restaurant strip, to Old Montreal and to the shopping area of St. Catharine. None of those took much more than 10 minutes each way. We even used the internet for free to look up things to do in the area, but brought our own ethernet cord because of another reviewers response. Here are the few and minor cons to this hotel: 1. Parking- there is no hotel parking. We parked our car at a meter right behind the hotel. It wasn't cheap, but it wasn't any more expensive than a garage. The next day, we moved our car one block over for free parking. There are lots nearby, but we're young and cheap and able to walk a few blocks. 2. Bathroom accessories: water pressure for a shower was pretty low. I mean, it was adequate, but it left something to be desired. The towels/washcloth/etc must've been the cheapest available. If you like nice, big towels, you might bring your own. The bath mat was paper, and there was no maid sent to clean our room... which we didn't mind because we only stayed 2 nights... but therefore we didn't get clean towels the next day. 3. Kitchenette- 2 place settings but no pans or cooking utensils. Originally the plan was to eat eggs for breakfast in the room to save money. We did use the little fridge to keep our coffee cream cool. 4. Location- though it was central and we felt comfortable walking the area, there is a sketchy little park right next door where there was some very obvious homelessness and drug activity. There was also some sex related shops that families might be uncomfortable walking by (not that you could see anything from the street..) The area was well patrolled by law enforcement and we never felt unsafe, even in the evening. If you are a solo traveler, you might feel more uneasy. There were other very small minor things that a 5 star hotel wouldn't have overlooked, such as: the TV was very far away from the bed, no headboard or footboard (I guess you could say it was the modern decor?) which made reading in bed more challenging, no people to carry your suitcase to your room, etc... though none of those things impacted our trip.
