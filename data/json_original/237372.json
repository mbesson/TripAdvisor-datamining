This location was great for shopping and surrounded by places to eat. The staff were very friendly and willing to answer any questions with a smile. When we checked in the women at the desk gave us a map and circled all the must see sites and explained how the water bus worked. The room was \"cozy\" but not the smallest room we've seen. The room was divided so my son was able to have his own space while my husband and I had our area. Have to say the shower was the smallest one I have ever seen!!! A basic breakfast of croissants, rolls, cream cheese, jams, OJ, and coffee was included. If I had any complaints was that the room we stayed in was a little noisy because it was against an ally that kinda projected the walkway noises. As one reviewer said \"cheap and cheerful!!\" One thing... there are stairs to climb to get to the reception desk. We stayed on the same floor as reception so I do not know if there were more stairs elsewhere. I did not notice an elevator.

The first two hotels looked prohibitively expensive and were booked out. About five minutes later I came to the Hotel Spagna, a nondescript looking building on the main street. Walking up the stairs I was greeted by a friendly chap at the reception desk.. he wouldn't tell me the price of the rooms as he insisted that I look at them first. As it turns out the rooms were exceptionally cheap, 50 euro for the night which equates to about $60-65 Australian dollars. This price also includes a very basic breakfast which consists of OJ, coffee and bread rolls and croissant with assorted jams. The rooms themselves were small, clean and basic, they kind of reminded from the 1960's era. I wasn't looking for anything amazing or fancy, just somewhere where I could store my suitcase securely and crash comfortably for the night after walking around Venice all day taking in the sights - Hotel Spagna fit the bill perfectly. As you have probably read in other reviews, the Hotel is situated conveniently about 5 minutes walk from the train station.. and Venice isn't that big anyways so from the hotel you can easily walk to all the major tourist attractions of the city. All in all a great little hotel - simple, clean, tidy, secure and represented great value for this traveller.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, England", "Title": "\u201cFantastic stay\u201d", "Author": "Coachburgess", "ReviewID": "UR123497342", "Content": "We were moved to this hotel at the last minute, as the other hotel we were due to stay in had closed.

Hotel Spagna remined me of some of the older botique hotels that still exist in NYC near Grammercy Park, but with fewer finishing touches. Wireless internet was an abomination and hotel wasn't much help with it because they farm it out to a third party. Rooms are clean, but a bit dated. Cable TV had two English speaking channels and thousands of channels overall. Check in and check out were a breeze.

As everyone else has said, this is five minutes walk from the station or 8 minutes from the car parks in the Piazzale Roma. From the station, take the door to the left as you walk out and you'll avoid the steps to the front. The only hurdle you'll have is getting bags to your room the property - there is no lift and reception and the first rooms on are floor 1 (one above ground). There are four stories, so pack light or bring someone strong and fit. Whilst the room was of a good size, and on the first floor, the room could really do with some updating and brighter colours. The grand walls covered in fabric are looking a little tired and if they were replaced with some brighter colours and a new carpet, the whole room would go up a notch. The lamps could do with an upgrade - and with energy saving bulbs, there's no excuse for dim hotel lights anymore. Bathroom was clean, functional and compact with a small shower. If you're XXL, you may find it hard to move around the shower. Breakfast is in a small room off the reception area - small being the word. You need to squeeze in with fellow guests and/or wait for a table. The breakfast waitress does not seem happy in her job, though we did see her smile once in three days..... maybe because we were leaving. No fresh fruit, cheese or meats with the cold breakfast: croissant filled with jam, rolls, butter and more preserves and tea/coffee/chocolate and orange juice. While you're there, go for a pizza at http://www.pizzeriaallanfora.com/ - it's just 10 minutes stroll over the canal through the back street on the other side, but well worth it. Check the other review on here for details. Boat Tips (ACTV Vaporetto). The fares for single boat trips are wallet shrinkingly expensive! Even buying a pass will cost you dear. So - work out when you want to use the boat and pack your trips into a 24/36/48 hour block. Remember, a 48 hour ticket bought late on Friday will still see you travelling most of Sunday - so buy what you need and exploit it. (If you are mobile, you can walk around most of Venice easily - you only need the boat for islands and the Lido and, maybe, a cruise up the Grand Canal). Boat rides do keep kids amused, though. If you want to be sure of a seat on many of the services you'll find that they originate at the Piazzale Roma, which is just a short walk from the Station, over the bridge. Take the walk and be among the first on, or, if you already have a pass, take a boat from the station and back-track!. During the day the ticket queues can also be shorter here - you can also buy tickets from some tobacconists. Route one is a great cruise down the Grand Canal back to the hotel - get on at the Lido if you want to be sure of a seat at the back.", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, clean, and quiet\u201d", "Author": "tripper17", "ReviewID": "UR115941839", "Content": "This hotel was very close to the water bus station, which we took from the airport in Venice.

Breakfast was OK; the usual Italian breads, jam, processed cheese, honey, coffee and juice.

What made it for us was the courtesy and helpfulness, shown to the many stranded guests by the staff, especially the daytime receptionists. Being central and close to the bus, rail, and water bus stops, an ideal location to explore Venice, without breaking the bank.

In the slightly cheaper area of Venice where meals/drinks cost less than in St. Marks Square! You walk everywhere in Venice so take your walking shoes! You can take the water taxis though which are fun! It's about 40mins walk from the hotel to St. Marks Square. The hotel is sweet with some rooms have a brand new bathroom suite. The staff were very helpful and friendly. Continental breakfast was included in the price, which was in a small room. But we only had to wait for a table one morning out of the 4 we stayed! I would definitely recommend this hotel, it's good on the budget in pleasent surroundings.

The good points are plentiful. The rooms are reasonably sized and nicely furnished. Cleanliness was very good. As there are no elevators, you and your luggage must climb at least one stair case, and as many as four if you are on the top floor. The downsides are minor, save that the air conditioning could barely keep up, and often couldn't. Ok, it was August, but that's no excuse. The room furnishings were outstanding; this hotel is a little bit worn, but still quite elegant. The staff may not be from Venice, but don't let their lack of tourist knowledge stop you-- they're also good multilingual hosts. The breakfast was good (ask for milk and cereal if you want it) and consisted of a croissant stuffed with sweet stuff (tasted like a croissant almandine) and coffee/tea with orange juice as well as rolls/cheese/butter/marmalades. The pot of coffee was appreciated and was delicious. The hotel staff speaks good English, but lives on the mainland and isnt very good in terms of tourist information. Overall, the hotel was better than many three star hotels we have stayed in in Italy and France.", "Date": "August 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Africa", "Title": "\u201cGood location at a decent price\u201d", "Author": "SallySA", "ReviewID": "UR32989810", "Content": "We booked this hotel through www.hotels.com and we were pleased to find this hotel easy to find from St Lucia station - literally 5 minutes walk.

Reviews indicated that the breakfast wasnt wonderful and if you're expecting bacon and eggs then you will be disappointed - if however you are fine with jam filled croissants, a small selection of packaged cereals, and bread with preserves then there is more than enough to satisfy a hungry tummy.

Breakfast was nothing special - just a coffee and a few bread rolls with jam and butter - but the fish tank in the breakfast room was a nice distraction :-) My only complaint was that my room was just off the main reception and breakfast room so was a little noisy first thing in the mornings.

A good supply of lights however ( they were needed) The bathroom size was ok but the shower was tiny ,about 2 foot square , and the shower riser rail was broken.However the room was clean.The main drawback was the bed ! Standard 3 ft single but HARD. I like a firm mattress but this was ridiculous.A rotten night's sleep and the aircon was either switched off or not working.Never found out which.
