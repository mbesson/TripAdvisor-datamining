The hotel had been recommended by a colleague and my company had a corporate rate agreed with the hotel. Firstly, the breakfast was excellent with a great choice coupled with an efficient service and it exceeded my expectations. The wifi in the hotel which is included in the price of the room was reliable and I successfully used FaceTime on my iPhone with no call breakups. However, the hotel room was not a 4*+ standard and I left feeling that the hotel hadn't got the basics right. My main problem was that the room was incredibly noisy and I could hear other hotel residents moving around until late at night which kept me awake. I could also hear running water at times even with the bathroom door closed which again was loud enough to significantly disturb. I really was not impressed that the bed had a plastic sheet which I would not expect from a hotel marketed as 4* in quality. The bathroom was also in a poor state of repair with a shower that cycled between scolding hot and freezing cold. Again not good for a so called 4 star hotel. On the last morning there was an unpleasant odour in the bathroom which again suggests poor plumbing. To summarise, the Atenea Aparthotel does very well with the value-add extras but falls way short of the required standard on the basics. I would say that this hotel is nearer to 2/3 star and I wouldn't recommend this hotel unless it is convenient to where you need to be.

The conference was at the Hilton (about 5 mins walk away) and the conference rate at the Hilton was a lot higher. Its in a good location (if you want to be in that part of town) and a perfectly good hotel - despite the reviews :~) Some points to note: The hotel provides a discount for the car parking facility next to the hotel. But it still cost me 22+ euros for the night (only had a car 1 night). The room was great but too hot and adjusting the temp didn't appear to make much difference. The water pressure was extremely high. Turn on the shower and the head promptly flies up (under the water pressure) and shoots water all over the towels at the end of the bath. 1st night I dried myself with a hand towel. It would be a minor thing to prevent this with a better quality shower head fitting and I can't understand why they don't. There were several wifi networks around. I found one which let me on free - no idea whether it was legit or not. The 2nd night I got back after a hard day at 8:00pm and found the room hadn't been made up. The soaking towels where where I'd left them in a pile under the sink. A call to reception sorted it. Breakfast buffet was adequate. A reasonable selection of cold meats and cheeses. The hot stuff look 'tired'. If it wasn't in the rate I'd have gone out as it costs 10 euros. Smoking: there were ash trays in the room but there was absolutely no trace of smoke and I have a very sensitive nose for smoke. The only time I notice anything was the last morning when there was a vague smell of smoke in the corridor. No iron or coffee making facilities in the room.

It was just a short walk to the stadium and it definately saved the hassle of trying to journey back into the city centre on public transport after the match - the queues for the metro after the match were huge. Although it is not in the city centre, it is only a couple of minutes walk to Les Corts metro - and most of the main attractions and the city centre itself were therefore only a short trip away - we certainly didn't feel out on a limb. The hotel was also about a minute away from a large El Corte Ingles store and the upmarket shops on the Diaganol. There was a good choice of restaurants on the Diaganol - we had lunch in one and it was packed out with Spanish people - always a good sign. The rooms in the hotel were large and spotlessly clean - slightly outdated, and more 3 star than 4 star, but perfectly ok. The bed was also huge and comfortable and there was a sofa and coffee table in the 'living area'. There was a huge breakfast buffet, although this did not seem to be topped up during service, so it ran out of things later on. We found the reception staff to be helpful and friendly.

Unfortunately, we were very disappointed with what we found, yes the hotel is very convenient to the metro, but that was about its only positive feature. The hotel is very dated and the curtains and carpets in the rooms could do with a bit of a scrub. Although the rooms had kitchens, unless you bring your own kitchen utensils with you this is not a major advantage. On the plus side the sheets were clean and we were provided with clean towels every day. The walls in the hotel are extremely thin, as well as becoming familiar with our neighbours' (above, below and beside) nocturnal habits, we could also smell smoke from other rooms. Breakfast was a bizarre affair, granted during our stay breakfast was served in a different location from the norm, but this did not excuse the complete lack of organisation. The room consisted of mainly large tables, seated for about 8 people, so we had to share with other groups. On the first morning we had to wait until bowls were washed to have cereal, on the third morning our cereal was soggy by the time we got spoons. The toaster did not work and the hot food was luke warm.

I think people should state how much they pay on here, not to brag, but because what you pay dictates what you expect and therefore how you review. The room was clean and a decent size, but don\u2019t expect an apartment, ours was more like a bed-sit, but this is not a criticism. Small kitchen, adequate bathroom, sofa, very large double bed, TV, everything you need. The other reviewers who criticize the lack of cutlery, crockery and pans etc just needed to ask at reception for whatever they needed as they were more then happy to have plates and cutlery sent up to our room. The food in the restaurant was ok. The gastronomic menu was fairly good value at around 23 euros each, nice tapas and then main and postres. The staff were very friendly with good english and the bar waitress makes great sangria. The location is 15 mins walk from Nou camp, which was good for us as we went to a match. It's also only a couple of minutes walk from Les Corts metro station. We were a little worried about safety on the metro but found it to be very good. ATMs near by too. The Mussols restaurant near by was nice enough, but other than that you probably need to get a taxi to eat out. All in all we really enjoyed our stay at the Atenea. The hotel was fantastic considering the amount I paid and would have been good even if it had cost more. Just a note on pick pockets in Barcelona: I carried a bag across both shoulders and kept it on my hip in front of me, and we had no problem.
