The view from the window was to the inner yard - means the view of the wall in front. . The breakfast was only available by room service. The advantage was the price we paid - was much less than other hotels nearby. Also we'd like to pay tribute to the staff - they tried to thier best in those circumstances.

After checking in at 3:00 we went up the elevator to a very old smelly hallway. we opened the door to our room and were a little disappointed at the cleanliness of the room. The carpet hadn't been changed in decades, the bathroom looked old and the doors were from circa New Amsterdam. My girlfriend and I decided that we would take a nap, then go downstairs to the front desk to ask for an upgrade to a nicer and cleaner room. The guy at the front was quite understanding. He gave us a key to another room which was ALSO dirty. We both agreed we would just stay in the room we were in already. As we were getting ready to go for dinner, my girlfriend yells, \"Aaron!! OMG!!.\" \"WHAT?? WHAT??\" \"There's a rat in our room!!!!\" I jumped up and looked under the bed and behold...a disgusting NYC rat was tucked up against the wall under the bed. We freaked out, ran downstairs and demanded a refund. The guy at the front desk had a couple maintenance people collect our belongings from the room and take them down to the lobby for us because there was no way in hell i was going back into the room. No questions asked, our money was refunded and the guy at the front desk was assisting us in finding other accommodations. Fortunately, we were able to find a MUCH nicer place..The Benjamin Hotel (where when we checked in and told the front desk our story, they upgraded us to a king bed suite).

We stayed in a hostel for the first 4 nights of our stay in NYC and because we didn't like the hostel we decided to move to a hotel instead. So with very short notice, we managed to book a room with the Buckingham the day after Christmas Day and a reasonably price (by NYC's standards). First impressions of the hotel was good. Thought the reception was a little 'dark', the staff were friendly and helpful. Our room was LARGE by NYC's standards - compared to our closet sized hostel room previous to staying at the Buckingham. The room and bathroom were clean. The only negative thing about the room was that I noticed it was quite cold as soon as we walked in. Seeing that we were right in winter and had just experienced a snowstorm (freezing outside!) I was quite adamant that the heating be good. We turned on the heater and it worked for the most part but I still felt like the room wasn't as warm as it should be. I called the front desk and they sent a portable heater to us which really helped warm the room. Once we got the portable heater, I was pretty happy and had no other complaints. The hotel's location is excellent! It is a one minute walk to the subway station. A 5 minute (or less) walk to Central Park and has lots of restaurants/cafes/pharmacies nearby. Very, very convenient.

We had a one bedroom suite as there was originally meant to be 3 of us travelling.

We basically wanted a hotel with a kicthen to cut our eating out costs down and there are very few of those around. Having already been \"burnt\" by trying to rent an apartment we found the Buckingham. The hotel is in such a good location. Central Park is just a few minutes walk, Time Square is about a 10 minute walk as is the Rockefeller Centre. It is on a busy main road so going back at night wasn't a problem although this did mean some traffic noise through the night but then again it's the price you pay for a good location. Just take ear plugs if you are a light sleeper. The room was large enough for 4 people to not be getting on top of each other. The furniture/decor is out dated but every thing was clean. The bathroom could do with an update but again it was clean and everything worked so no real complaints. The kitchen was adaquate for light meals and snacks which is pretty much all we wanted it for. Plenlty of closet space too. Enough for 2 girls clothes and christmas shopping anyway! The staff were very friendly and helpful. On hand to offer advice and to help out where needed. There is a very nice Italian restaurant next door, can't remember the name but the food was lovely and the price wasn't too bad either.

Otherwise you are likely not to be able to sleep. We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. The first room that we were given was big enough and it looked clean. However, the sink was clogged and the furniture was very old, which made the room dark and gloomy. On our reservation sheet, we required a room that is quiet and on the upper floors. However, there was construction on the street just in front of the hotel and they gave us a room on the forth floor that just looks upon the construction. We were not able to sleep at all that night!!! We came to NYC for three nights and spent one of those nights struggling to sleep and having a really bad night. The next day, we wanted to switch rooms. the staff responded very unfriendly, said that it wasn't their fault, they didn't know that there will be construction (it as there when we checked in in the afternoon), and they could only change our room if there is another room available. They didn't apologize or made any soothing comments. We left the hotel for the day and packed out stuff because they told us that they would move our stuff to the new room if one became available. Upon return, when we asked for our keys, they said they couldn't move us to the new room because we didn't pack our stuff. We told them that we did! They found out that they confused us with another room,which also wanted to change rooms (we were not alone, apparently they had noise complains too). They, again, did not apologize for this confusion! The new room was smaller, and the TV was not working. It was fortunately not looking to the street but this time it was looking at the middle space where all the air conditioning were located. We managed to sleep but with the help of the ear plugs. The only positive experience we had was that they accepted to store our baggage for a couple of hours in the reception after we checked out (which is a standard thing for the hotels to do anyways).

There was a view of the next building and some pipes down below that made a loud sound, it was horrible! So we went right back downstairs and I told the woman, Candice, about our lack of view and the pipes. I said it was our 5 year anniversary and we wanted something on a high floor. She not only changed our room, she upgraded us to a suite!!!! When we went to our room, 9G, our jaws hit the floor. There was a beautiful corner suite with a living room, a kitchen, and the bedroom was a king! We had reserved a queen, so this was a great upgrade. And the view was spectacular, we could see the hustle and bustle down below us. Not only that, after we had come back from our stroll in central park (which is a block away from the hotel, and so is the subway), there was a bottle of champagne on our table! Candice had gotten it for us for our 5 year anniversary, complements of the hotel! We were so shocked! Because of the quick and responsive time, and the \"not a problem\" attitude, and the need to make our stay extra special, I rate this hotel 5 stars and would go back again in an instant! Another great thing to know is that you can call the hotel for any kind of reservations for dinner in the city, and they will reserve it for you. Candice asked our price range and got us an italian restaurant named Fragolino's next to Times Square for that evening for us. And Another staff member later gave us instructions on how to get o the Museum of Modern Art.

Hubby was very impressed with the amount of space that we got and said \"Wow\" as we entered. Initially I was planning to use Priceline to try and find a hotel around $125 per night. But some people suggested that we find a \u2018cancelable back up\u2019 so I started researching and found this hotel having a special of buy 4 nights and get the 5th free. Their deluxe suites were listed at $147 per night and with the 5th night free that brought our stay to $117 per night (with taxes it was total of $145 per night). I researched other hotels, and it just made me like this hotel even more. It\u2019s not a new place, but it is very spacious. I\u2019m typing this in our living room that is as big as our bedroom. We also have a full kitchen and it\u2019s stocked with everything we need. The bathroom is sufficient, but it won\u2019t win awards for cleanliness. I guess that\u2019s where the age of the hotel shows up the most. And it has 2 closets and a walk in closet; we didn\u2019t even know what to do with all of that space. They used to be apartments before it was remodeled into a hotel. We had a corner room on the 14th floor, 14E. We could see Central Park from our bedroom window and had a view down 6th Avenue. We could hear street noise but it wasn\u2019t enough to wake me at night (I\u2019m a light sleeper). We traveled with our sound machine and I used earplugs the first few nights but realized I really didn\u2019t need them. Hubby slept like a log. And I don\u2019t know what New Yorkers call the subway lines but we were right next to the BDFV line, one block from the NQRW, and two blocks from ACE and 123. So anytime we needed to go anywhere we just hopped on the subway and were there within 15 minutes (25 minutes to Battery Park in rush hour). If you are looking for a great location and comfortable room with a kitchen this is a great hotel, we\u2019d definitely stay here again. I didn\u2019t have any complaints, everything worked well and all the staff were very helpful. Would have loved WiFi in our room, but if we needed to get on the internet we just went down to the lounge on the 2nd floor, we also used the business center to print out tickets and our boarding passes. One afternoon I heard someone singing from the room next to ours and wondered if it was someone preparing for their concert at Carnige Hall. Then another day I heard a piano. Turns out a woman lived there before they\u2019d changed it to a hotel and still lives there and she teaches music lessons. We loved the music theme to the hotel. So, now that you\u2019ve decided to stay here, here are some tips: Check out the coupons downstairs at the front desk. We went to Top of the Rock and then came back and looked at their coupons and realized there were coupons right there for $2 off that attraction and many more places. We got a great map from the front desk that we used all week. Duane Reade is just across the street for Walgreens/CVS type things A little 24/7 grocery store called Green Market is just around the corner on 6th towards Central Park. They had fruit, drinks, snacks, a lunch/dinner bar, frozen stuff, etc. We wandered into this store at night before we went to bed to grab some breakfasty stuff for the next morning. Grab some water bottles and put them in your fridge to save money on getting them from a vendor. Angelo\u2019s Coal Oven Pizza is about 3 doors down on the right if you are walking out of the hotel. We had a great dinner there one night for $37. It wasn\u2019t crowded so they sat us upstairs on their balcony and we had a great view of 57th street. Hubby had great chicken parm and I had a delicious lagsagna. We also ate at Caf\u00e9 Europa for $25 total and it would make an excellent breakfast place, thought pricey.

We were greeted at the door by a friendly, helpful staff member (Marvin) who helped us unload all of our luggage and took it up to our room which was a wonderful start to our New York adventure.

Sandra and other staff members gave us restaurant suggestions, parking information, and directions several times throughout our visit which really helped us.

We had two rooms (16H & 14C) and they were both perfect - lots of room to spread out and relax when we had the chance. We didn't do much cooking but having the refrigerator and microwave available for quick breakfasts was wonderful. The rooms are certainly not modern or \"glitzy\" but they are comfortable and clean which is what we wanted and the beds were the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in at a hotel.

In Manhattan terms, for a hotel of this quality, that is a steal. I'm an author who had three publishing appointments right on 57th Street. So for starters, the location was escellent. The location is also perfect for midtown, Lincoln Center, Central Park or the theater. I'm also an ex-NYer who has moved away, so I enjoy being able to walk everfywhere I need to go. The hotel's booking agent put me exactly where I wanted to be (high floor, the 14th, overlooking 57th) the room was very clean, well lit and comfortable. The kitchen was fully equipped, all utensils clean. Maid service was excellent, quick and efficient. Check in, check out were each completed within 5 minutes. Everyone I encountered on your front desk, day and night, was right on the ball, pleasant and able to answer any questions. When the airport van stopped on 6th instead of infront of the building when I was departing for JFK, the doorman was quick to help me with a large bag. The only tiny glitch, a coffee maker that didn't work (not the hotel's fault). I mentioned it and a replacement with there in minutes. This is an older building, but that, to most NYers, is an asset. The room I had was like an old fashioned studio apartment, in NY terms. There is bus service immediately nearby, subway also. The area is safe 24/7. Oh, yes. There's a 24/7 Duane Reade drug store across the street and an all night grocery around the corner on 6th Avenue.

There were two young children and two of our party had special dietary requirements, so we knew the suites with kitchenettes would suit our needs. I booked three rooms (for 5 / 3 / 3 ) that were all the same price ($379 plus tax per night). We were assigned 4G, 8K and 12K and gave out the keys at random. All three rooms were one-bedroom suites with kitchenettes; this is an apartment building that is being converted, apartment by apartment, into hotel rooms. All had been renovated to some degree, and two were typical one-bedroom city apartments with a smallish bath. One suite (4G) was much larger (about 800 sq.ft) and more luxurious (a relative term, certainly) with many windows on two sides, two large closets, larger bathroom, etc. Despite the differences in sizes, they were all the same cost (including tax, about $440 per night.) All the G rooms are the same size, FYI. The K rooms are smaller and laid out differently. The location was perfect for our itinerary. There was a nicely appointed, smallish lounge and business center on the second floor, and a wonderful laundry in the basement with six coin-op washers and dryers, $1.75 each. The dryers ran 60 minutes for that price. Also in the laundry room: two clean folding tables, drink and snack machines, and a small commercial icemaker. The housekeeping office was next door to the laundry. Although the hotel does not have a coffee shop or room service, the Green Cafe two doors up is everything one could want in a quick deli/diner. Two blocks over, the M&W had a complete selection of hot and cold prepared foods and not a bad beer/wine assortment for a grocery store. A Cafe Europa on the corner was a good place for a glass of wine or late meal. One of our rooms had a slow drain problem that was fixed within a few hours of being reported. None of the sofa beds was comfortable, and there was a waiting list for rollaway beds. The housekeeping was good, and the front desk staff was friendly and attentive. The hotel was very accessible to the theater district, Rockefeller Center, and Central Park. We had no trouble getting taxis at the corner of 57th and Sixth Avenue. I would like to address the subject of noise, as it seems such an issue with people writing unflattering reviews of this hotel. New York City is loud. If you are on the fourth floor---or even the 12th---you are going to hear city noise at night. It really doesn't have that much to do with the windows, either. People who have never been to NYC or have only stayed in a high-rise hotel are going to be surprised at how loud a lower floor can be. That does not reflect poorly on the Buckingham! It's even more odd, considering there is an all-night pharmacy across the street that sells very cheap ear plugs if one really couldn't sleep.... all I can gather is that people would rather complain about something that can't be changed than take steps to mitigate its effects. I would unreservedly recommend this hotel for people traveling with children, and because of the large sizes, for those who would rather have more space than more amenities.", "Date": "December 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fish Creek, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cBuckingham Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Stillpeople", "ReviewID": "UR11240500", "Content": "A spacious hotel in New York City!

Save your money and get some sleep. The Suckingham, as I now call it, is a converted apartment building. I've stayed in these kinds of places before, but this one was the worst. While the rooms are actually small apartments, I found mine to be completely horrendous -- moldy smelling, with complete with crappy, tacky furniture. The mattress was easily 10 years old and the frame was barely screwed into the headboard, so everytime I moved I squeaked like hell. These are fine features if you're trying not to get a good night's sleep. I was honestly afraid to put my feet directly on the 3\" thick shag carpeting after flashing on what might be found in this room with a black light. Add to this that I cut my toe -- yes, cut my toe -- on the parquet flooring, where nails were sticking up about 1/4 inch near the heating unit. Basically I was hoping to get the mold smell out by circulating some air in there. Silly me. As for the bathroom: I wouldn't take a shower in that room if you paid me. They also don't have a restaurant, or a bar, which is okay. If you're in Manhattan, you should go out. It does kind of suck that they don't even offer coffee in the lobby in the morning though. Speaking of the lobby, the thing is a giant echo chamber. A family with a little boy was there when I was checking in, and I couldn't hear the desk clerk over their conversation. And when the kid started crying (which I don't blame him for, having stayed at The Suckingham now myself), forget it. We would have had a better time hearing each other if we walked out onto 6th Avenue. And of course they screwed up my bill, and our travel department had to resend everything again -- twice. Are you surprised? I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and hope that things are different if you have a family who is on a budget, but I am loathe to say my company paid $300 for this dump.

The general decor was 'tired' throughout. the non stop muzac/jazz irritated almost as much as the intrusive honking of horns from the nearby intersection, heard reasonably clearly despite being on an upper floor thanks to the ill fitting windows. We had booked a 'suite' which included a kitchen - reasonably equipped, one double bed and one sofa bed. the living room and bedroom were OK and sized well for four. The en-suite toilet/bath/shower was cramped and definately in need of modernising. The joke of the whole stay was the sofa bed. When extended the foot of the bed sloped off to such an extent you have needed surgery to make contact with it whilst lying on the main part . The main section combined the thinest, most uncomfortable 'matress' i have ever felt along with undulations and contours that ensured anyone using it was forced to the centre of the bed. the combination of faults rendered sleep all but impossible, and made the hard floor seem most attractive. Exiting the hotel the next morning we suggested that the sofa bed was entirely inadequate and could something be done about it. Re-assured we went for a day out in New York. On returning at about 10 p.m we discovered that nothing had changed. A visit to the front desk revealed two desk clerks, neither of who could do anything as they were 'only front desk people' , the hotel was full and maintenance had gone home. When I suggested they raise the issue with someone who could do something I was informed the manager would be asleep - not really the right thing to say to someone about to endure a second sleep free night. The headclerk did agree that the sofa beds were entirely rubbish though, which was reassuring that it was not just me being picky. After informing them that I intended sleeping in the lobby as it would be more comfortable, providing I was unable to find an alternate hotel I went back to my room and started leafing through the yellow pages. About two minutes later a knock at the door and a (single) roller bed was pushed into the room. One of us still had to sleep on the (folded up) sofa and the situation was not improved through the remaining 3 days of our stay. I may have been rendered suddenly deaf but I did not hear any expression of regret or apology from any of the staff. On leaving the chap handling our bags was as good and helpful as on the way in.

The hotel room of course didn't match the ones pictured on the hotel website but the room was surprisingly spacious and very clean with little necessities like a working kitchen, CD/Radio, DVD/VCR player and two T.Vs. The staff was very nice. I must warn you not to sleep on the sofa bed. I believe it contains more springs than mattress.

We stayed in 16F. Weekend rate is slightly higher - $239-$259. Internet is pretty high - $12.00 a day for a device. However, business lounge on 2nd floor provides free wireless (albeit slow) You are almost across the street from Carnegie Hall Grocery store - is just 1 block west past 7th. A Whole Foods is in the basement of TimeWarner building in Columbia Circle. Great place to stock up and get your pre-cooked meals. Great mac-n-cheese for kids. Duane Reed - there is one across the street, 2 on 7th Starbucks - across the street Dry Cleaning/Laundry Service (charged by the pound) - there are 2 behind the hotel on 58th. Much cheaper than hotel's service. Deli - The Green Cafe - get your cheese slice and soda for under $5.00 Subway - there is a stop on 6th and 57th that takes you mid-town. 2 blocks takes you to Columbia Circle to catch the 1,2,3 to downtown. Moms/Dads - Central Park - Hecksher playground is just 3 blocks away (walking distance). An absolutely wonderful play area for toddlers and kids.

We booked the reservation through the hotel's website, convinced that we had found a great deal: a spacious suite in a convenient location for less than we'd historically paid in better-known places that, when occupied with people and suitcases, seemed to offer only cramped rooms-turned-obstacle-courses. We were not disappointed. I admit, however, I was initially taken aback when, a few days before arriving, I confirmed our reservation over the phone. The person I spoke with was quite rude, insisting that my confirmation number-- the only one I'd been given, and I had the email to prove it-- was incorrect. I'm pleased to report, though, that during our actual stay every employee we encountered was pleasant and helpful. On first impression, our suite looked a bit dated and dingy. But with each passing day, it felt more comfortable. This was due in no small part to an excellent housekeeping staff. Each morning, they cleaned and vacuumed thoroughly, and left ample supplies, including linens, shampoo/conditioner, soap, and dishwashing liquid and paper towels for the kitchenette. The hotel seemed to be occupied by a healthy mix of business travelers, families, and people we assumed to be professional musicians. We were pleasantly surprised by the unexpected amenities-- including free wireless Internet access in the lobby and in the nicely appointed second floor lounge, and a more-than-adequate fitness center and sauna. And of course the excellent location, close to Central Park, Times Square/theatres, and Fifth Avenue shopping-- didn't disappoint. Drawbacks: the pull-out sofa mattress was uncomfortable at best, our kitchen cabinets contained only a few plates/bowls, cups, etc., and the parquet floors were joltingly slippery. But the positives-- the generous space, the numerous closets, the divided rooms, the kitchen appliances, the world-class \"elevator music\" and the in-room CD player (and 2 TVs)-- far outweighed the negatives. I wholeheartedly recommend the Buckingham, especially for value-minded families who can appreciate the extra elbow room.

WIthout delay--I knew I would not be happy in 7E for 8 nights, I called the front desk to see if there were any alternatives. A man, rather than the woman who had initially checked us in, answered. Hearing my request for a nicer room, without pause, he told me 16G was available. 16G was spectacular! It was right on the corner of 6th and W57th with fabulous cityscape, long views out all our many windows :). It was much larger than 7E (which we would have been charged the same price), looked as nice as the website photos, and served our needs perfectly. Since we eat only one meal out (usually midday) when staying for a week, we stocked up the ample, apartment size kitchen with breakfast foods and evening snacks. We even used the oven to heat up our Andre's Bakery cabbage strudel. No problem with the heat and it was one of Janauary's colder weeks. The livingroom/diningroom was great to come back to unwind and make plans for the next day's excursion. The bed was comfortable.

I chose not to pay for the extra hookup in the room, but went down to the lounge on the second floor where there is free wireless ethernet connection.

The front desk staff was nothing but helpful from the moment we arrived until check-out. I had anticipated needing to schlep my own bags to the room and do without any concierge services. I was wrong. The staff was more than willing to answer all our questions about transportation and directions regarding the subway system.

The coffee maker left a lot to be desired though. It\u2019s a little four cup model and was woefully slow and made very weak coffee. The coffee is free of charge and restocked every day so what can you say. Thankfully, there\u2019s a Starbucks on every block surrounding the hotel. There were major street repairs going on throughout the city and unfortunately, right out in front of the hotel. Seeing as the repairs are made at night, it was very difficult to get a good night\u2019s sleep during our stay. Even when the construction noise ceased, the street traffic was hard to get used to. Who needs sleep while on vacation right?! The primary reason that I will return to this hotel in the future is the location. It\u2019s perfectly situated to many of the attractions in midtown Manhattan. We were able to walk to Rockefeller Plaza, Central Park, Times Square, and the many luxury shops on W. 57th.
