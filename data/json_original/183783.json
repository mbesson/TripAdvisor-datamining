The price for parking (C$12.00) was reasonable, compared to other hotels in the area. There were two minor issues that I had with the hotel: 1. It was difficult to park nearby when checking in. There were no signs to show where check-in was, and the parking to check-in could be better. I found a place near the taxi stand, but it wasn't the right location. If you're driving, the other location in front of the hotel is awkward since you will need to go around the block to park in the lot. 2. I asked not to receive a newspaper, which I didn't.

At last the elevator upgrade has been completed this year so they are MUCH better than last year, so at least no line ups. My big problem this time was the A/C in my room. You can't turn off the fans in the rooms which are noisy at best, so I generally set the temp to ambient so hopefully it doesn't keep blowing through the night, as it definitely disturbs sleep. This time, nothing I did made the a/c keep quiet and it was a big problem. My final night, for some reason the a/c was blowing ice cold air all night and it was freezing in my room. I like a cold room but that was like a fridge. I spent most of the night awake as it was so cold, and on complaining in the morning I was offered a breakfast, which to be honest I never eat there as the buffet is not great. The girl asked what she could do for me and did eventually credit the night when I suggested it. I thought it should have been offered a bit sooner but I did leave happier, albeit very tired due to lack of sleep. This was on the exec floor as well so I was disappointed. I have never found the air traffic a problem at all, and have always found the rooms to be quiet, except for the a/c! All in all, a very nice hotel, comfortable, good staff, although as I mentioned, the breakfast buffet is expensive and not very good value, although the choices are reasonable. I use the Tim Horton's across the road as a rule. The bar staff is great, and it is also nice to see that the bar menu has changed at last. Not before time. I really do think that the hotel all around needs a bit of an update, especially the a/c's in the rooms! The Japanese restaurant is very nice but expensive although not owned by the hotel. I use the sushi restaurant half a block away. It's really great. LOVE the cookies at check in!

The first staff member we saw at 15h00 admitted that the hotel was overbooked, and that if we had arrived a little later, we might have ended up with no rooms at all. After 2h30 we were scared to loose our food ( our cooler needed to be plugged in the wall) so we went back and after a lot of talking, we got two rooms, different from the ones we reserved in the first place and not on the same floor but at least we could plug our cooler. When we booked the room, we asked the hotel to reserve a fridge for us in one of the room, no fridge were available when we arrived. We met with a guy who was part of the \"overbooked\" people, and he had to carry his luggage all day long for 2 days, with no sleeping place since no other hotel was available either. He stated that he was sleeping in the fast food around the corner... - Forget room service if you're not ordering food. - Mastresses are very comfortable and is the only thing I really enjoyed.

Harry's was swamped due to all the folks with missed connections trying to eat at the same time, but the staff took it all in good spirits. In short, I would definitely consider this to be a viable option as far as hotels go in Toronto near the airport. However, there is one major and one minor factor that might prevent me from doing so. Major: needing to take the airport shuttle between the hotel and airport. The shuttle was full in the morning and some people had to wait for the next shuttle - this could cause an issue if you hadn't planned in advance for such a thing to happen. Minor: the airplanes were quite noisy even in the room - perhaps the window glass could be more soundproof?

I only ate at the Caf\u00c3\u00a9 and the Japanese restaurant but my colleagues mentioned the Italian restaurant was quite good as well.

I had a number of issues (none of which were the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fault) and he helped me with everything. I had forgotten my medication back home and Carl contacted my pharmacy and had them fax over my prescription to a Canadian pharmacy. He then arranged for a 4 day prescription to be filled and to have it delivered to the hotel! My luggage had also been lost by Delta (DELTA \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Expect Luggage To Arrive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.

He told me where I could get inexpensive temporary clothing and offered to set up a rental car. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never received this kind of service at a hotel or otherwise.

Generally speaking, every time I book a hotel under the Hilton Brand I know exactly what I'm getting.......not the case this time around. Now I like to consider myself fairly open minded, patient and down to earth but my stay here was awful. I started staying at Doubletrees wherever possible because they are hotels which usually have an upscale but comfortable environment (sometimes the full service Hilton's are a bit too sterile for me). There was absolutely nothing upscale or comfortable about this hotel. I arrived at the Toronto airport and I was picked up by the Hotel shuttle. The shuttle was on time, exactly where it said it would be and even though I didn't need it I was offered luggage assistance.......a great start! Upon arriving at the hotel I was incredibly disappointed. It was late afternoon and the first thing I saw while stepping off of the truck were the lobby windows, completely filthy.....hand prints, dust, dirt, everything you could think of. I'm not speaking of some build up in between cleanings, I'm speaking of windows which clearly hadn't been cleaned in months. As I entered the doors the first thing I saw to my left was a large powerbar/powercord with plugs in it for the lobby lamps...... also from the 80s or earlier? Awful brass lamps. Of course after these two things I noticed everything, dirty pink and green carpet everywhere and a truly eerie feeling.......absolutely nothing upscale at all. Keeping in mind this is all my first impression. I approached the desk, still with an open mind, and things got even worse. There was a dedicated line for Hilton Honors members so I made my way there. A really rude woman said 'You didn't see me waiting for you over there?' while pointing to a terminal a bit of the way down. She was full of attitude, rolled her eyes, didn't smile even once and even worse, focused mostly on her computer. As each hotel is different, usually the desk agent tells me my benefits as a Hilton member....I was told nothing at all except my membership was on file. I took my key, regretting being booked into the hotel, and made my way up to the executive floor (the 12th floor) to get to my room. I'm not sure how this was the 'executive' floor as it was musty, dirty, with old carpeting and hallways that resembled something out of a horror film. I opened the door to my room and for a BRIEF moment I was mildly calm. I thought 'ok this isn't so bad'......wrong again. Other than a flat screen television (with no option to order movies??????????) the room was terribly out-dated. Once again, dirty carpet, destroyed furniture, and old fixtures. My bathroom had peeling wallpaper, a dirty mirror and mold all over the grout.........and this is all to the naked eye! I called downstairs and told the front desk I was unhappy with my room and they told me 'Well sir, if you aren't happy on the executive floor that's our best'. I was exhausted from a long day at work without the energy to argue.....and with such disgust I simply let it go and quickly opened my laptop and booked the Hilton Garden Inn Toronto Airport (review to follow). I ordered something to eat because I truly thought, how can a burger and fries go wrong? WELL..............LET ME TELL YOU............Great burger! Perfect fries, well done just like I asked for....... and promptly delivered. When it comes to hotels it doesn't take much to keep me happy. All I need is a clean comfortable room and I don't even ask for the staff to be OVERLY friendly.......simply alert and helpful. This was hands down the worst Doubletree experience I've ever had and I will never........ever.......return to this hotel. On the plus side.....(yes there are a few)....... It's close to the airport. The food was great, the cookie I received when I arrived was exactly the same as every other Doubletree cookie I've had (perfect). The porter was funny and helpful and you could tell he would do anything for you. All in all.......I just don't think a good burger and a porter who smiles is what a hotel is all about.......", "Date": "April 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Erie, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cFast & neat.\u201d", "Author": "MikeP12", "ReviewID": "UR100557394", "Content": "Check in & check out were fast , guest services were always at the ready it seemed . housekeeping was fast & cheerful .", "Date": "March 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cA noisy 4 nights...\u201d", "Author": "jfsabs", "ReviewID": "UR99006668", "Content": "I stayed at the Doubletree for 4 nights.

I had to drive back and around and finally got parked (for $12/night). The bellboy proceeded to take my bags on the luggage cart, and was banging the cart around corners and hitting the houskeeping cart. Not appreciated! I got to my room on the 9th floor and it smelled smoky (even though I was on a nonsmoking floor). I called down to the lobby and switched rooms. The room itself was nice but sort of outdated. Nice big flatscreen tv, 2 queen beds and a nice view of the toronto congress centre (so bright at night). I went in the bathroom and found several long black hairs on the floor which I was very grossed out by (considering I have blonde hair so I know its not mine!). The concierge (Anthony I think) was very nice and helped me find a clip to close my curtains as there was a spot of light that kept shining in. Also gave me an extra cookie :) The planes are SO noisy and same with the traffic on Dixon road. I had a really tough time falling asleep...and as soon as I did, the planes would start again at 6:30 AM. You would think that a hotel by the airport would be a bit more soundproof. There is a nice fitness centre and a swimming pool. As I was going up the stairs to the slide, the steps were really grimey and dirty. I was regretting not wearing shoes on the steps! There are several restaurants in the hotel....also a bunch across the street (Tims, subway, milestones, kelseys) which was nice. There is free internet in your room (sometimes it was fast, sometimes it was slow). All in all, I would not stay here again unless I had to.

It was there so long, the crack was black: AKA: MOLD! ~Woke up in the middle of the night scratching - found a BUG IN MY BED (needless to say, I could not sleep that night, even after having torn my bed apart to ensure there were no others. Hardly able to stay awake during business the next day.) ~Bugs flying around the room the next day. Took pictures and showed front desk where I was accused of bringing into the room myself via luggage! When I stood up for myself, front desk staff backtracked and said he meant other guests. Nice deflection - not. Then tried to say they were fruit flies from food in my room. I did NOT have food in my room and he forgot I took a picture of the bugs. Showed to him again to prove they were some little flying beetle-type bugs. I finally got a new room and was told the old room was being fumigated.

Had a nasty headache and felt ill for two days after that. ~Shampoo in new room was a half empty bottle!! Ewww... used toiletries displayed as if new! DISGUSTING! ~Mold in the shower ~Dust so thick on the sprinkler head near the ceiling that a CHUNK of it fell on me as I walked by. ~Restaurant extremely overpriced and very small breakfast buffet selection.

At the Sheraton, the hotel was lovely, the food was just superb and our room was great.", "Date": "June 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Akron, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cYikes - Believe the Bad Reviews\u201d", "Author": "jooksing", "ReviewID": "UR64851131", "Content": "I have stayed at this hotel several times over the past few years.

Other than the rebranding by Hilton to become a Doubletree, there have not been enough changes to the property. It is tired and dated. I came to this hotel for a convention. Its location by the airport and shuttle access make it attractive for the event planners. Check-in was efficient and uneventful. I arrived with a co-worker at about 7:30 pm. I was given a room on the 5th floor at the end of the hall, so it was fairly quiet. I did not hear planes overhead as some other people have commented. The elevators did not all work the entire time of my stay. When they did work they were a bit on the flaky side. The room was large as was the bath. The TV was the old school CRT type, not a flat screen. I thought Doubletree was supposed to be a higher end or specialty hotel to distinguish its brand from other Hilton properties. The free wireless Internet access was appreciated and worked well. The room contained a desk and chair, wingback chair, glass top table and king sized bed. The bath had a decent sized countertop so I could place my toiletries and have room to spare. The commode handle had to be held down for a full flush to occur. The shower worked well, although the bath faucet shot water all over the side of the tub instead of into it. The closet was a double sliding door type. Oddly enough the door to the bath was also a slider. Lighting in the room was a little dark, even with all the lights illuminated. A pet peeve of mine is when there is no light for the closet. Guess what, no light for the closet in this room. The thermostat did a terrible job of heating and cooling the room as it was either way too hot or way too cold. My room was set to broil when I first entered it. I used the fitness center and found it to be the high point of the hotel. If memory serves there were three ellipticals, four or five treadmills, a stationary bike, free weights, exercise balls and several benches. The ellipticals and treadmills were higher quality units with the screens for TV viewing or statistics. Although the hotel has three restaurants and a bar, I avoided the restaurants. If the food in the restaurants was as good as the limited menu in Harry's and priced the same it would not have been worth the expense. I walked across the street to Kelsey's and Millstone instead. Millstone is much better than Kelsey's. I did not make the trek to the Montana steakhouse on the other side of the viaduct. I had heard from other hotel guests that the Japanese restaurant in the hotel was very good. The attached convention center was convenient but very small, and in my estimation undersized for our group's needs. The layout inclued dual stairways and a very narrow escalator to reach the upper level, all of which should be remodeled to increase floor space. Actually I wish they would just tear down that portion and redo the convention center completely but I doubt that it is likely that would ever happen. The last feature I will mention in this review is that the hotel has a significant amount of space devoted to retail. It is almost like there should be a casino where the convention center is, as it reminds me of that type of layout. The only thing missing is a lot of smoke. Fortunately Ontario has a smoking law! It seems odd to say this, with all the amenities this location has to offer that I would be so indifferent to this property. I would only stay at this hotel if I had to. I would rather stay at another location nearby, and will again consider that in future events planned for this location. The key is that you are basically in the middle of nowhere, aside from the two restaurants I mentioned that are across the street. The hotel knows that you are unlikely to venture outside in February.

We did this since the hotel was offering a very attractive package including one night stay plus parking for the duration of our vacation. The package was definitely priced very attractively.

There were two major problems we noticed within the first 30 minutes of our arrival. First, the people working the desk just seemed very unhappy and it was rather clear to us that they did not like working there. We live close to Toronto area, and we have stayed in a few Canadian hotels around here, I have never stayed in a property with this level of \"employee morale\" problem. This morale problem was even affecting the airport shuttle drivers. It was clear to us that at least one of the drivers we encountered was clearly unhappy about his predicament to be employed in that capacity. Also, it was unfortunate that the actual hotel part of the property was not the same vintage as the convention area. The rooms (on the executive floor) were rather small with lack of modern conveniences including the wall switch for lighting. The furnishings appeared to be from the late 70's/early 80's. The room was clean and tidy, but it showed the fact that everything in the room were very old. The mattress was not very comfortable to sleep on. Also, something in the room (maybe the heating unit?) was making this constant buzzing throughout the night. We did not very sleep well that night.

However, upon check-in, we were immediately told that there were no more double-bedded rooms left. We had an online prepaid reservation for a double-bedded room as well as an online confirmation from the hotel, so we were upset. The gentleman at the front desk, whom I believe was the hotel manager, did not apologize for having given away our room. In fact, he was rather abrupt with us and appeared to be attempting to get rid of us as quickly as possible. He had a heavy accent and was difficult to understand at times. He told us that there was a trade convention on that weekend, and everyone wanted a double-bedded room. He made it clear that we would have to take another room, but he would give us a free \u00e2\u20ac\u0153upgrade\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to a larger room, unless of course, we did not want it (this was said in a belligerent tone of voice). Since our reservation was non-cancelable and non-refundable, it was getting late, and we were tired, we agreed to take the other room. What choice did we have? When we got to the elevators to make our way up to our room, other hotel guests told us not to stick any part of our bodies in-between the elevator doors because the doors were not equipped with sensors. On the way up to our floor, I had to get out of the elevator to allow the person behind me to get out, and the doors abruptly closed behind me. The person that was supposed to get off at that floor was not able to get out before the doors closed, and of course, I was not able to get back in. I was separated from my family until another elevator came along, and that took a while because of how busy the hotel was that evening. Anyway, after finally making it up to our floor, we discovered that our room was located way down the corridor at the farthest possible point away from the elevators. This annoyed us because there were no trolleys available to help us move our luggage to our room (and we had a lot of luggage). Apparently, persons associated with the trade convention were already using all of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s available trolleys. When we finally arrived at our room and opened the door, we were very disappointed. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153upgraded\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room was only slightly larger than a standard room, and the lay-out was definitely not suitable for a family of four consisting of three adults and one child (our daughter is 21 yrs. old, and our son is 10 yrs. old). The room contained only a king size bed and a pull-out sofa bed. No one wanted to sleep on the sofa bed. In the end, my husband decided to share it with our son since he did not want the girls to be uncomfortable (very admirable!). Unfortunately, the springs were shot on the bed, making it very uncomfortable. Needless to say, he did not sleep well. He awoke several times throughout the night and finally gave up on sleeping altogether by 4:30 a.m. During our stay, we had several concerns besides the room type. The first pertained to the cleanliness of the room. The cushions on the sofa bed were lightly stained (perhaps from spilled soda pop), and when pulling out the sofa bed to sleep on, we discovered that no vacuuming had taken place under the sofa bed in a very long time. Also, we were expected to use the sheets that were already on the sofa bed, but since we could not ascertain how long it had been since someone had changed those sheets, we did not feel comfortable using them. Fortunately, a very kind gentleman that came to our room to make the bed decided that he was not happy with us using the current bedding either, and he left to get us some fresh bedding (thank goodness!). He was the nicest person that we dealt with during our stay at this hotel. On the morning of our departure, I wanted to make coffee, but there was only one disposable cup under the coffee maker (the coffee maker requires two cups since it makes two cups at a time), and that cup had a dead fruit fly in it. I contacted the front desk, and someone did come up to our room with two new cups right away. Another thing that we noticed was that the hotel was in need of some renovations. For example, the floor tiles in our bathroom were chipped. Also, we noticed that the floors in the corridors were not level (some areas were higher than others) which is a definite safety hazard. If one were not paying attention, one could easily trip and take a nasty fall. As for the carpets in the corridors, they looked fairly new, but they were buckling heavily, probably due to the unlevel flooring. As for the elevators, they are in need of repairs, especially if the sensors are not working. An additional concern for us was the service at this hotel. The gentleman who checked us in at the front desk was not very friendly. Also, he told us that someone would come to our room with extra bedding to make the sofa bed. No one appeared, so we called the front desk. After our phone call, an entire hour passed without anyone arriving at our room with the requested bedding. We called the front desk a second time, and finally, a gentleman arrived to make the bed. At this point, it was 10:00 p.m., and we were so tired that we just wanted to lie down. Finally, more of a disappointment than a concern was the fact that our room was not equipped with a mini refrigerator to store our drinks, nor was the bathroom equipped with an exhaust fan. Our room at the Doubletree in Niagara Falls (a wonderful property!) where we had just spent two nights had been equipped with both of these items, so we expected same at this Doubletree hotel. In the end, when we checked out from this hotel, we voiced many of our concerns to the young lady at the front desk, and although she was not unpleasant, she did not appear to care about our concerns either. She never apologized for the hotel and barely made eye contact with us. As for the unsuitable room that we were given, she told us that it is written in our online hotel confirmation that our preferences depend on hotel availability. To us, this completely defeats the entire purpose of making a reservation. If one cannot depend on the room type requested at the time one makes a reservation, what is the point in making a reservation at all? After returning home, I contacted guest services for the Doubletree hotel. The lady that I spoke with was very nice and a pleasure to deal with. She told me that visits at Doubletree hotels are 100% guaranteed, and she apologized profusely for our bad experience. I believe that she was sincere. In any event, she promised to contact the hotel directly to allow them an opportunity to deal with my complaints (and she did). She also told me that she wanted to do something to compensate us. Although my purpose in complaining was simply to bring about awareness rather than monetary gain, I thought that her offer of compensation was a nice gesture. She asked what I felt that my stay was worth (which I appreciated), and I told her that I would be happy with a 50% reduction. She thought that was fair, and she immediately credited my Visa. Had it not been for the exceptional service that I received from guest services, I would never have returned to this particular Doubletree property again. As things now stand, I will give it another try in the future, but I will give the hotel a little time to fix some of their problems before I return\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 As a final note in closing, I was told by this hotel that it is their goal to become the busiest convention centre hotel in Toronto. Although I believe that this goal is admirable, and I wish the hotel success in achieving it, I would strongly urge the hotel not to diminish the importance of families and single persons visiting the property because they are also an integral part of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6", "Date": "August 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cfine..cookies are a nice touch\u201d", "Author": "travellingangie", "ReviewID": "UR37705987", "Content": "We had visits with relatives in Toronto and found the airport location no trouble...they gave us a free upgrade at check in and it had this great view of the flights making their arrivals.

We had an issue every single time we needed to speak to the front desk staff (e.g. being told that we couldn't have 5 in a room when our reservation explicitely stated it was for 5). We were re-directed away from the lounge we paid to access obviously or apparently as there were insufficient staff to cover the volume of business (which should not have been a surprise to the hotel since they host the Anime North Convention the same time every year). The roll out couch was broken and uncomfortable for my sons. The tv was ancient and when we rented a movie, it came with a permanent set of static lines at the bottom. The elevators drove us mad. Two of them were out of service basically the whole time we were there meaning long waits (again this was during an annual convention) and indeed on check out day the elevators were so full that we walked down from the 10th floor and had to exit through the kitchen since the fire alarm was set on some of the doors exiting the stairwells.

I guess if it really bothered me I would have complained. Restaurants: Lots of restarants - we ate mostly at the main resaturant, the Orchid (I think it is called).

There were Italian/seafood, Japanese, Chinese, American, and a nice lobby bar as well. The Chinese restaurant (Grand Chinese Cuisine) had pricey, but excellent, dim sum. Grand Chinese didn't have as wide a range of offerings as places in HK or Vancouver, and it was quite a bit pricier here. But their shark fin dim sum soup, Shanghai steamed pork buns and shrimp rice noodles were just superb. I was hoping to use their indoor pool with two nice waterslides.

This was the case with the Doubletree, which we were staying in for the first time. I had been to this hotel several times in the past for conferences and thought that it looked reasonable enough to stay in. So I booked a King bed in a corner suite for our before-flight night. No problems with check-in, check-out or parking. But the entrance hall/carpet in our room was totally soaked with some fluid, which I assume was water since a storm had just passed through the area. The rest of the carpetting had a few rolls in it and we found some belongings from the previous occupant hanging on the back of the bathroom door (we wore shoes to get to the bathroom, to get across the soaked carpet). Normally, we would have notified the front desk and insist on being moved but it was 11:00 PM and we had to catch a shuttle at 6:00 AM so we just went to bed. Unfortunately, our room had a connecting door to the next room and I had to listen to our neighbour's TV for a few hours before drifting off - not the best night's sleep I've had. I can only assume from previous reviews and reccomendations from friends that our experience was an anomaly rather than the norm. Although the hotel room interiors are a bit dated, we did notice that airline flight crews were staying at the hotel and I assume that they would not normally stay in substandard rooms.

I then had to speak to the onsite manager and he gave several excuses which had no validity whatsoever, I debunked them all and he wouldn't listen to reason from myself or his employee. He was extremely rude, when I was trying to get him to refund what he overcharged, he just walked away from me. He said he could do nothing about it but he was simply lying. He could do something, he didn't want to. Completely unprofessional. Even though there is a phrase that the service industry goes by, the customer is never wrong, in this case, I was 100% right. This manager exhibited such unprofessional behaviour, even towards his own colleagues such as raising his voice and asking meaningless questions which drew some attention from those around. I was appalled by his actions, never did I see a smile from him. He ruined my stay there. I'm appalled he is a manager. Never in my life have I encountered someone with such a title.

I know this particular hotel is very strict with security, so I made arrangements ahead of time with a person in charge of booking sports teams.What I needed was somewhere for the adults to go when the kids had to be in bed for curfew. I knew they didn't provide free hospitality rooms, so I inquired about paying for a conference room or something comparable. The person I talked with was very helpful, and offered me a large suite, which he said would fit 30 people. He also said since I had got 2 teams from our area to book with them, he would give it to me at half price.I called to confirm the week before, he said it was all set. He did inform me that at 11 o'clock the radio had to be off and the noise level had to be down. This is totally reasonable. Well I collected money from all the parents from both teams to cover the cost. Thursday night we stayed in the room until around 1:30, then turned in. I also went to the front desk and requested blue boxes and large garbage bags, so that we could try to keep things clean ourselves. Well the second evening was quite a different story. Security showed up and the suite and 8 o'clock and said it was quit time now. When I questioned him on it and said I was told 11, he knew I was right and left. He then returned at 11 and said they had had noise complaints. When I told him we would keep it down, I was informed, that he had a contract that said the room had to be vacated at 11, and that only 2 people were allowed in the suite. First of all, I don't know any hotel that says a family of 4 cannot stay in suite. When I asked to see the contract he showed me, it stated 11 quit time only. He said the person who rented the room to me shouldn't have and he wasn't in until Monday, so we were to leave or he was calling the police. I had to ask all these parents that had chipped in money to now leave. The wonderful security gaurd in the meantime called the police. They came and were very understanding. I told them of the numerous lies this man tried to pull over on me. Of course they could not do anything, as it was the hotels responsibility. When I asked for a manager, I was told they never had one on duty. Hard to believe a hotel doesn't always have a manager on. We had also ordered pizza from the hotel. I was quoted a price for 22 pizzas. I collected the money from the parents, and waited. I was called back by this same security person to say the price was changed, and it was $60 more. I said, I was already quoted and prices and had collected for it. I said for the large amount of the order, we should have been getting a better deal anyway. They were charging us approxiametely $27 per pizza. He said he would send us less pizza then. When I told him to cancel the order, all of a sudden the price was back to the original. We waited for 2 hours. Then we never did get to finish them because we were kicked out of the suite and the key changed. I tried to take this up with the manager the following day, but the customer is always wrong was basically her moto. She informed me we would have to wait until Monday, when we were back home to get any answers. As you can guess, I called today, and nobody was available.

A regular breakfast a la cart, ends up costing more than that, which of course all but guarantees that most people will go for the buffet, even people like me who don't tend to eat a big breakfast. We did not eat lunches or dinners at the hotel, the prices were more than we wanted to pay. We did have excellent meals at several different restaurants in the area.
