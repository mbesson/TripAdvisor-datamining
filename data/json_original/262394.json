As we have stayed with you before we were expecting the same standard of room as last time. My son booked this room for the two of us as a 'thank you'. When I came to check in I explained my son had booked the room on the internet for us, only to be informed they needed to see his credit card which I thought was a bit harsh as my son was not with me. In the end I had to give a copy of my credit card to the receptionist so I could book in. On arrival at the room the walls looked like they'd been rubbed down with a greasy cloth. In the bathroom, when I pressed the pedal bin the lid flew off. I went to make a cup of tea and the only socket had a fridge, tv, digi box and telephone, all in one socket so I had to disconnect one so I could boil the kettle. I laid on the bed. The only way I can explain this having visited The London Dungeons I probably would have had a better night's sleep on the Rack!! On rising in the morning my partner decided to have a shower. Suddenly I heard a piercing scream, I jumped up to be told the shower only had boiling hot water which would not regulate. I tried the cold tap but to my surprise the cold tap was also the hot tap!!! My overall opinion of your hotel was a severe disappointment having stayed with you before. On departure 'we' paid for 'our' gift from my son. We usually have breakfast in hotels but after seeing the dirty substandard rooms which you let your customers see, I did not think breakfast would be a good idea. Thank you once again for an unforgettable stay and this will be my last ever stay at the Pasha Hotel.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cHamam Experience\u201d", "Author": "BBW1960", "ReviewID": "UR125704792", "Content": "My friend and I experienced the two hour hamam experience, which included a Turkish Bath, full body scrub and chocolate mask, all of which were excellent!

We chose pasha as the photos on the website look very luxurious and inviting, however, what a massive disappointment ! We took a taxi to the hotel and first impressions were not good. The hotel is squeezed in amongst shops and looked very strange, even the taxi driver laughed ! The hotel lobby was full of women, screaming children and buggies, so when we were informed that our room wasn't ready for another half an hour, we had to leave the hotel as there was no where to sit and wait. Instead, we headed to the only pub that we had seen in the run down area, which was across the road, where we sat with an old chap watching a film of the tv at full volume! After checking in we were led by the receptionist up 2 flights of very narrow, steep badly lit flights of stairs which had no rails to hold, talk about a health and safety hazard.when we reached the 2nd floor we were shown in to a dark dingy room which absolutely stank of cigarette smoke, and we were told by the receptionist feel free to smoke in here! As non smokers my husband and I didn't really like the idea that we would stink like an ashtray by the end of our stay. The room was hideous ! The carpet was filthy and stained, there was an area near the bathroom that had a loose piece of carpet covering bare floor which we constantly tripped over and had to replace, the wardrobe was falling apart, the window was broken and taped up, there were. Massive gaps around the only plug socket in the room, the door to the fridge did not shut and it stunk, the drain was clogged up so the shower tray filled with filthy water and overflowed, there was a broken drain in the middle of the bathroom floor which I cut my foot on and the mattress stunk and was so cheap and thin. This was honestly the worst hotel we have ever been in, and considering we opted for a more expensive hotel as we wanted a bit of luxury, it was also a massive dissappointment. The staff wrere friendly enough but not speaking very much English made it a bit hard to communicate. I really begrudged handing over hard earned money to stay in the hovel! And at \u00a380 a night, it is certainly not cheap. The hotel describes itself as compact, comfortable and classy! Ha more like dark, dingy, dirty, cheap, nasty and sleazy !!!!! Absolute joke, the area it's in is run down, dirty and there is absolutely no entertainment in the area (apart from the run down pub opposite). I would not pay \u00a320 a night for this hotel, it's an insult. Save your money and find a proper hotel!!!!!!!

I'm not sure why some reviews have said the front of the hotel looks like a shop or a restaurant. It was clearly labeled and looked nothing but professional from the outside. The receptionist was very helpful, asking where we had come from and what our plans were so she could guide us on how to best get to where we wanted to go. Was seeing a gig in Brixton and the buses (34 or 45) take you practically outside the venue in under 20 mins. The room outside was spotless, very smart. The bathroom was lovely with a walk in shower. We even had two cans of coke and some crisps waiting for us free of charge in our room! The air con was lovely as well as it was a hot night! The only improvements I could suggest is making it clearer on the website that there is no elevator.

The booking was made before we read the reviews. Given the negative publicity the hotel has received, we would not have stayed there if it wasn't for the need to be close to a conference venue. All that was mentioned is true and no doubt will influence others to look elsewhere for a hotel in the area. However, there are positives and with time I have little doubt the owner will make improvements to Pasha. The place is next to a railway line, but the owner tries as much as possible to offer the quieter rooms first. Rates are reasonable, considering the hotel is in London. We paid \u00c2\u00a370 for two. Breakfast at an extra charge of \u00c2\u00a35 never materialized, but we preferred to look for a cafe or coffee shop and make our own choices. The room was spotless, the TV worked, and the staff were very friendly. The hotel was on an excellent bus route to the South Bank and the city centre. My hope is that with support, the owner will focus on some of the details: better internal insulation and fresher passageways that absorb some of the scents from the sauna room. The bathroom facilities could do with improvements, the electrical wiring in the bedroom was rather makeshift and the beds need reading lamps. He has tried to create a small Turkish haven with some of the amenities - the sauna, the beautician's salon and the restaurant at the back of the hotel. This was a very brave decision, considering the location isn't upmarket London.

Hotel Pasha was around 10/15 mins bus ride from Brixton and the price for a superior double room (\u00c2\u00a390 + \u00c2\u00a310 for 2 breakfasts & \u00c2\u00a35 to park in the car park) was within our budget so it seemed the perfect choice. Having read a few of the reviews on this site I was slightly uncertain as to what we had let ourselves in for in terms of the actual hotel but if you know South London and Camberwell in particular you'll know that you're not getting the picture postcard side of London with regard to the area and the hotels location. The car park at the rear of the hotel doesn't really give you a great first impression (think Hill Street Blues) but once you're inside the hotel you soon forget about that. As stated in other reviews the hotel does indeed back onto railway lines and you actually pass under the railway arches (if you enter from the car park) in order to get to the front desk via the restuarant & function room. The front desk staff were very welcoming and friendly and we were shown to our room after filling out the obligatory form and provding proof of ID. Our room (312) did back directly onto the railway line and it was certainly very obvious when a train went past that it wasn't going to be something you could ignore if you were in the room for any length of time. We decided to bite the bullet and stay put based on the fact that we were going straight back out again and wouldn't be returning until after 11pm. To be fair I don't think any trains went past at all on Saturday morning so my concern about getting woken up by the first early morning train was unfounded. It may be a different case on a week day though.... I would say that perhaps only 6 of the hotels rooms are actually directly overlooking the railway lines and that if you weren't in one of those 6 rooms you probably would never know that they were there. I guess the staff would move you to another room (if available) without hesitation if you requested not be near the railway lines, it's probably worth checking with them when you book if you know it's going to cause you a problem. The room itself was totally acceptable, decent comfy bed with clean white linen and towels in the bathroom. It looks like the rooms were refurbed in the last couple of years in the contemporary IKEA showroom style, which was fine by us. Breakfast was a standard English affair, sausage, bacon, egg, tomato with tea or coffee. The coffee was very good but I'd expect that from a Turkish owned and run hotel. As I said earlier the staff were really helpful and friendly and they let us leave the car in the car park all day Saturday whilst we went into central London to do some shopping and sightseeing. The hotel is served very well by bus routes with stops just outside that will run you into central London in 20/25 mins. Despite the train lines that run behind the hotel there is no underground station within walking distance so you would really need to either use the buses or take taxi rides to get out and about.
