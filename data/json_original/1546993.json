The hotel lobby was always full of people suggesting it is a well used hotel, yet it never felt that way once you left the lobby. The only downside was that the lobby always smelt of cigarette smoke.

You could tell by the number of guests waiting in the lobby throughout the day and evening. This is basically a 3-star hotel which is relatively new and located in an increasingly popular and developing area behind the Mall of the Emirates. The rooms are adequately sized and come with the amenities one would expect for the hotel category plus a little more such as free wired internet access, fridge, coffee and tea making facilities in the room. As some earlier previews mentioned, it has a higher standard than Ibis for example, which is usually priced at the same level but feels less than 3-star in comparison. Another goodie is the free underground parking, a blessing if you have a car and to avoid the hot Dubai sun! The only major flaw worth commenting on is the shower design. It is virtually impossible to take a shower without soaking the bathroom floor, no matter what you do. The shower basin is shallow and the cabin itself is half-open with no curtain, so water splashes automatically and flows over the edges. The bathroom in the room I stayed in already showed severe moisture damage to the floor tiles, door frame and corners. This is a pity really because this flawed, non-functional design is bound to run this hotel down very quickly if not rectified soon and is likely to result in high maintenance costs and hence higher rates to maintain the standard. Opening the windows can become a noisy and dusty affair, since Al Barsha is currently undergoing a major construction boom and road works all around the hotel are in progress. As a result, the roads are congested during the day and sand is constantly in the air. This prevented me from switching off the very efficient A/C in the room to enjoy the naturally pleasant January breeze in Dubai. Walking to MoE takes about 7 minutes and reaching the metro station takes another 7-10 minutes inside the mall. Apart from the hotel restaurants which I didn't get the chance to try, there are a couple of good Arabic food joints (falafel, bakery) right opposite and next to the hotel if you want to grab a quick bite.", "Date": "January 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "The Netherlands.", "Title": "\u201cBasic hotel.\u201d", "Author": "Angelique_op_Reis.", "ReviewID": "UR122759396", "Content": "This was our second trip to Dubai since 2007 and this time we stayed six nights from December 28th until January 3rd in hotel Citymax Al Barsha. We choose this hotel because of its central location close to the Mall of the Emirates. Our flight from Amsterdam to DXB took 6 hours and 30 minutes and we arrived very early in the morning. The check in time in the hotel is officially after 2.00 pm, but after paying 180 AED we immediately got a room. We wonder why they make scans of the passports. It is forbidden in the Netherlands and we didn\u2019t find it necessary because we have booked a packaged deal via a travel agency! Room: We asked for separate beds and were given a twin bedded room on the 11th floor. The room was very basic, but clean. We heard no noise from the streets and it was very quiet. Facilities room: - TV (BBC World, Dubai One and RTV) Unfortunately no CNN World or BVN TV (channel for Dutch expats). - Open closet - Desk with chair - Chair - Coffee/tea maker with two mugs and two glasses - Fridge - Air conditioning Bathroom: - Shower - Four towels - Soap Business Corner: Next to the coffee shop are two computers which we can use through a voucher. This voucher costs AED 20 for 1 hour and is valid for 24 hours, AED 35 for 3 hours or AED 50 for 24 hours. I asked the receptionist if we can print some documents. She said that we had to send these documents to the reception fo@citymax.nl. Why should I send my documents to the reception? A socalled \u2018Business Corner\u2019 must have a printer, doesn\u2019t it? Strange! After checking the internet I saw that there was a printer selected, so I asked the receptionist again. Now it was possible to print my documents. The printer was installated at the coffee shop and each print costs 1 AED. Why didn\u2019t she say that before? Breakfast: The buffet is from 6.30 am until 10.30 am and was good. Sometimes it was very crowded so we had to wait a couple of times for a table. The personnel is very friendly and asked every time before closing time if we needed something else from the kitchen. International dinner buffet: The dinner is from 7.00 pm until 11.00pm and costs AED 55. We dined here two times and it was very good. Rooftop pool: The pool is located at the rooftop and is open from 07.00 am to 09.00 pm. From here we have a nice view at the hotel Burj al Arab and the Burj Khalifa. On New Years Eve we had a very nice view of the firework shows from both Burjes. Fire alarm test: On Monday 02nd of January there was a fire alarm test at 11.30 am. We got informed via a letter on Sunday. But, in the evening at 10.30 pm we were roughly woken up by a very loud noise. Was this an alarm? We called the reception, but we got no answer. Unfortunately we couldn\u2019t sleep anymore that evening, while we had to wake up at 03.15 am. Our transfer to the airport was at 04.30 am. Check out: It was just after 04.00 am when we checked out. The receptionist didn\u2019t ask \u201cHow was your stay\u201d, only \u201cHow can I help you\u201d? We paid the bill and she didn\u2019t give the change money immediately, but covered it with papers while she was working in the computer. I asked her what she was doing all the time and she told me that there was a problem with the system. Okay, but I want my money back. \u201cI gave you the money, she said\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d We showed her that she covered our money with papers. Okay, it\u2019s very early in the morning\u2026..

We stayed on a bed and breakfast basis and always found something to our tastes on the breakfast buffet and the pool is ideal for a chill out sunbathe after hitting the shops. The rooms were spotless and cleaned regularly. Fridge in the rooms to keep your drinks/suncreams cold so cant complain. We had a room quite high up and heard no noise from road or other guests.

The hotel is small and primarily a business hotel. On your checkin you get the taste of their inhospitable hospitality. The reception staff asks for a deposit (although you would have paid the entire room rent) else you will not be able to use the room service. When we said we will settle the bills when we use room service they refused on accepting cash. Maybe they don't trust their staff with cash. The saving grace was that every floor has vending machines so you can always but water, aerated drinks and packaged snacks round the clock. The rooms are small but neat. We took a double bed but they only have queen size beds so its not very comfortable. The toilets are also tiny but clean. They have a small roof top pool which is not very big if you are planning to swim for exercise. They do have a small gym at the same floor. They have a sports bar which is always empty & also a bar with live music which is good. However, again the staff is pathetic. It doesn't matter if you are a house guest or not they black guy outside is very rude and needs to leave the hospitality line soon else the owners will suffer big time. I'll be surprised if he hasn't been socked by someone till date. The servers inside the bar also don't seem to understand the concept of hospitality. Once you order they will not leave till you make the payment for the drinks again it doesn't matter if you are a house guest and they know your room no. Pathetic attitude and even if you plan to stay there do give their bars a miss, there are much better and hospitable options outside. In short :- Hotel Location - Good. Rooms - Clean but small. Room comfort - Good air-conditioning but queen size beds. Hotel Staff & management policies - Pathetic. Value for money - Good.

He had stayed there, the rest of us had not. We knew only that it was in a great location and it was cheap ($200 for a double room for 3 nights), so I personally was not expecting much. However, from arrival, I was very impressed with this hotel. There was a slight booking issue (they had given us rooms with double beds and were completely booked, so we had to wait 2 days to change it), but other than that the service was superb. As the other reviews say, the rooms are small. With two people in the room you have to work it like a puzzle to maneuver around. But, being in Dubai, we weren't expecting to spend much time in the room anyways. The beds were comfortable, the TV worked well, and the AC was cold. Decor was also aesthetically pleasing, contemporary and simple. The bathrooms matched the rooms-also small. The first room we were in had a bathtub that was only partially closed off, so some water got out when taking a shower. The second room was just the little shower basin, so the floor flooded a bit. Easily solved by putting down an extra towel. The Maxx bar was also a surprise. The clientele was diverse, not just hotel guests. There were some obvious regulars (awkwardly comfortable in their domain), and generally just a nice mix. The prices were good, they had some different deals each night.

Good impression ! Room: Clean neat room though not spacious rather it was small. Well appointed furniture with good colour combination. Bed size should have been broader. Bathroom too was clean and nice though small. TV: Not many channels just about 18 of them. There was no information on the telephone numbers of Reception, Housekeeping and others. Just the room-service number! I had to get these numbers from the room-service department.

Good view of Burj Khalifa and Burj al Arab and other skyline from here. Gym too is good. Buffet Breakfast: Good and balanced food variety. Would have been better if the menu saw changes. All the 5 days had almost the same menu. Just 2 dishes were different specifically the Indian dishes every day. I don\u2019t know about lunch and dinner as I ate outside.

On a Friday, Saturday night the lobby area can get a bit loud due to the Karaoke bar in the hotel but in our room we didn't hear a sound. The biggest draw back to this hotel was you had to pay for wireless internet. If you have your own ether-net cable then it was free in your room or else they were selling ether-net cable for ten dirhams. Overall the location and price make this an excellent hotel. We will definitely stay there again.", "Date": "June 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat location ,amazing staff but small rooms\u201d", "Author": "Cshellz2010", "ReviewID": "UR113468897", "Content": "The overall stay has been pleasant .

This was my first time to stay in a Budget hotel and specifically in Citymax Al-Barsha Hotel. It seriously surprised me with its amazing treatment and 5 star level staff. We were greeted on arrival with a very cheerful lady on the front desk that helped us check in. The hostess of the restaurant area is a very friendly and always smiling young lady. Seeing her each morning with her glowing smile is something you would look forward to. The breakfast was average, yet the service and the staff made the dining experience very special. We were offered water in our room only ONCE, which is a little disappointing. The lack of WiFi access in the rooms was also very inconvenient. We had to go down to the lobby every time we needed to send an email. The room was not cleaned unless we requested it cleaned by calling the room service. (yet when we did, a staff member would do it instantly) Citymax Hotel is one of the best hotels I've been to. I have been to some 5 star hotels which didn't offer as much as this hotel did and were not as professional and dedicated as this hotel's staff was. In addition to its amazing location, this hotel's Major's asset is its staff and professional treatment. I will most certainly be staying there in my future visits to Dubai and will be recommending it to all my friends.", "Date": "May 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cVery clean hotel with professional staff\u201d", "Author": "Cyrus2007", "ReviewID": "UR109506439", "Content": "It was very good experience to stay at Citymax hotel Al Barsha.

The hotel has a nice roof top pool and towels are provided free of charge and you can also hire towels to take to the beach (for a small fee & deposit) which saves having to pack them. There's also a gym which has everything you need for a workout - f you're that way inclined when you're on holiday !
