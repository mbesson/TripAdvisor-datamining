Our stay was wonderful from the time we checked in to the time we checked out. The check in was quick and easy. Our flight arrived in San Francisco at 10 am and by 1045 we were in our room. We had suite #486. It had 2 queen beds and a fold out couch. We had a great view of the bay. Our room came with a microwave and refrigerator. The beds were comfortable with plenty of pillows and the bathroom was perfectly sized. The hotel and our room is very clean and very well kept. I was also impressed with every staff member. They always greeted us with a smile and with a hello. One of the best parts of this hotel was the included hot breakfast. My son especially enjoyed the pancake maker! I did not drink the coffee available in the room since they had yummy fresh brewed coffee with half and half in the breakfast area. The other part we love about the hotel was the location. We could walk to Fisherman's wharf in less than 5 minutes. We were able to walk every where and the locations we couldn't walk to had easy access to Muni/Trolley/Cable Car transportation.

This was the first stop of our USA road trip. Firstly I would give this tip. If this is your 1st stop like it was ours. Don't bother collecting your hire car until you leave. This hotel charges around 50 dollars a night to park (the ONLY hotel we visited that charged). We easily got around San Francisco without using a car and Fishermans Wharf is in easy walking distance. We saved three days parking and car hire costs by changing our booking. We caught a taxi to Alamo when we left which cost us less than 10 dollars. The hotel is in a great location but that is about all I can say in favour of it. The rooms look very old fashioned. There is no view unless you like looking into other peoples windows. The breakfast is shambolic. There are not enough tables and the eating area is at the side of the reception area, there were people sitting in reception eating breakfast and plenty more who couldn't get a seat. There is no wifi in the bedrooms, you have to sit in the lobby. There were two computers for customers to use. There is no bar or restaurant in this hotel either.

Fisherman's wharf is a very crowded touristy place. But I feel like this hotel is overly crowded. The line for breakfast in the morning seriously went through two rooms. I would say it took 10 minutes to get through this line and by the time I did, many of the options were gone. All the bacon was gone at 9 a.m. and even though the breakfast went until 9:30, they said they were not bringing more out. I waited 10 minutes to get a bagel and some cereal. Then when I got through the line, there was literally nowhere to sit. In the morning every single table is taken, every piece of furniture. There are people literally sitting on the floor in a corner eating ... or standing up and eating. After the first day, I said forget it and bought breakfast outside of the hotel. There were groups of kids there as well ... I would suggest if you see large groups of middle school and high school age kids hanging all over the lobby, you should ask the front desk to put you on a floor away from them. They get loud. Also, in the mornings and at night, the elevators get packed and crowded. It takes several trips of people jamming into them to go to your room. And of course many of the European tourists don't exactly grasp the concept of waiting in an orderly line, so many rush into the elevator even if you have been waiting there before them. A lower floor would probably be better. The service here is poor as well. I asked for an extended check out time and they would not give me one, even though I am a top tier rewards member. I am supposed to get a 2 o'clock check out if I request it. Not so at this hotel. Also, I am entitled to a room upgrade, if available. Not only did they not have a room upgrade for me, they said that they did not have any king beds left when I checked in. When I told them I was sure that I requested one on the website, they told me they were sorry but the hotel was full. So I got a room with two small beds. I was dissapointed to hear that there was no wireless internet. There is a free wired internet access port in the room, but that means you will have to sit at the desk if you want to go online. Another annoying thing is that there aren't many cable stations at all. There around 11 channels. 3 are sports related and 2 are hotel/local area related, leaving around 6 stations to watch. The hotel is clean and in a great location, right on fisherman's wharf. Every other hotel chain has a hotel in this area. You can easily and safely walk to the wharf. At night there are lots of homeless people who sleep in the allies near the hotel. This might be a concern for people with kids. These people aren't aggressive for the most part, so I didn't feel threatened by them. However, fisherman's wharf isn't the nicest of places after 11 o'clock at night when the crowds are smaller. You can walk a few blocks to the wharf or In N Out Burger or lots of restaurants. I love the location of this hotel. The lobby and furnishings are nice. The hotel is new. Valet parking is $30 per night. Kind of a rip off considering the hotel has its own connected lot. So keep that in mind when booking ... you are spending $30 per night extra on parking. Pretty standard for Fisherman's Wharf. I think there may be a cheaper lot connected to Enterprise Rent a Car on Beach Street, a block away, which might be worth a check out. Overall, this is nice and clean and in a good location. However, I would much rather stay somewhere with wireless internet and less crowds.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "18sunflowers", "ReviewID": "UR128268332", "Content": "My husband and I stayed in this hotel in April, for the first few days of our honeymoon.

The room and common areas were clean. Decor is bright and fresh. Our room had a \"view\" toward the wharf, it overlooked a parking lot but was nice for the Fisherman's Wharf area, although we got a bit of traffic noise from the street below. Many of the rooms' windows face each other in a sort of courtyard that is just cement and stucco, so I preferred the noise over a view looking into another guest's room. The hotel is older and if you look under the surface of things you can tell, but our room had newer furniture, the beds were comfortable and the carpet was clean. Housekeeping seemed to do a good job. The free breakfast was fine, typical free breakfast food, and they had a make your own pancake machine that enthralled the kids and looked like an Easy-Bake oven...press a button and 2 pancakes come out the other end in 2 mins.

Walking distance to Alcatraz boat, Ghirardelli Sq., cable cars, Pier 39, and all major transportation.

We had a rental car, which can cost a lot to park in SF. Our room rate included parking. While researching hotels in the area, we found comparable hotel rooms for a little less money, however they charged $40-50/day for parking and did not include a free breakfast. The Holiday Inn Express ended up costing less when you added in the extras.

OTHER COMMENTS There was no additional hidden charges such as \u201cresort fees\u201d which is charged by most hotels. I paid about $150 a night for a three-night stay on Wed - Friday which I think was affordable when sharing among 4 people. No Free Parking \u2013 but we didn\u2019t drive so it was not a problem. Parking in SanFran is very expensive. Near the wharf it is $2 per half hour. There was free Wifi but the signal was not strong enough in the room. We had to go down to the lobby to use the Wifi. If you plan to get work done in your hotel room and require Wifi, then you will be dissapointed. LOCATION Five minute walk away from the main eating and shopping area at the wharf. A convenience store, Walgreens was also nearby. We could easily catch the cable car or tramp to Union Square or the Lombard Street, the world\u2019s most crookedest street. SURPRISES The town closes quite early. We went out for dinner at 8pm and most shops were already closed. OVERALL I paid US$150 per night and stayed on the 7th \u2013 10th Mar 2012.

The hotel as a whole was a perfect fit for us, it's close to everything you could want to see in San Fransisco. The hotel is clean, my kids loved the breakfasts in the morning. The one experience I personally had was of a paranormal nature, can't say that I used to actually believe in ghosts, but I do now. Our room was on the 3rd floor, the room was always hot during the day, I called maintenance for this issue, at night it was like a freezer in the room. My bed was closest to the window, along the opposite wall is the double mirrored closets, while laying in bed you have a clear view of the bathroom. The second night of our stay, I awoke at 2:30 am to see who I thought was my son, head bent sitting on the commode looking at his phone. the room is totally dark and when the i phones light is on, it kind of glows like a flashlight . I at first didn't think anything of it, 17 yr old teens use their phones at all hours. I went back to sleep, and at 3:00 woke up again, only this time I called his name, asking what was he still doing on his phone, the person that looked up at me wasn't my son. I slammed on the light next to my bed, only to find my two sons asleep in the bed next to me. I was struck numb and speechless, with the nightstand light on, I could tell that the person wasn't solid. I always thought that it would be fun to see a spirit, after my experience, I think a bit differently. I was so scared I couldn't leave my bed at all that night. We all had weird things happening with our phones, the lights in the room, after that 2nd night we slept with the door closed. We wanted to change rooms and used the air conditioning as an excuse, the hotel was fully booked. I then called the manager from my cell, to ask if there was any experiences like this on the 3rd floor. I was embarrassed and a bit freaked out. they said no but asked for me to please tell them what room I was in, I caved and told them our experience. They were very sympathetic and said that I was the first person that this happened to, they explained to me that the hotel is fairly new, and they didn't know of any deaths in room 315. I really struggled with the idea of sharing our experience, I know that I would've liked to know if someone else had these weird experiences.

A full breakfast was included (bacon, sausage, eggs, biscuits and gravy, hot cinnamon rolls, as well as pastries, fruit, coffee, tea, and juices). Quality of the food was consistently good. Wireless internet is available in the lobby free of charge; wired connections are available in-room free of charge. The room was clean, of reasonable size, and with new furnishings. The bathroom was not large, but was of adequate size and was spotless. Common areas are similarly clean, modern, and with new furniture. I would guess that the hotel has been built or renovated within the past two years. Staff were friendly and professional. One of the best features of the hotel, however, is simply its location. The hotel is located less than 10 minutes\u2019 walk from Fisherman\u2019s Wharf, Pier 39, the Alcatraz Ferry, Ghirardelli Square, both cablecar lines, and numerous tram and bus lines.

The air conditioning is noisy - so is the bathroom exhaust. The TV looked old in the age of flat screen televisions. No wireless internet in the room - just a wired one. You are out of luck with an iPad. But there is wireless in the lobby and a couple of free computers in the lobby. There is a touchscreen information facility near the computers but the touchscreen is dodgy. The room safe is key operated which is weird. No room fridge or minibar. The room did not have a view - you get a window facing other rooms. Breakfast is loaded with sugar. No healthy choices like oatmeal - brown bread was good quality though. Most hotels in California had oatmeal but this one did not. It can get very busy at breakfast - go early for a seat. Hotel is very clean and they are keen on composting everything. I found it strange as the breakfast was served in paper plates and cutlery was plastic. We booked a taxi the night before only to be told that there is no record of this when we had to go to the airport. Luckily it was early morning and there were taxis lining up outside the hotel. The Amtrak bus drop off point is close by and you can walk to hotel - looked safe at night. Just don't disturb the homeless on the streets. It gets a bit quiet at night. Anyway the charm of San Francisco made up for the hotel shortcmings. It is a beautiful city. We only had two full days but we saw so much of the city on foot. Don't miss the following whilst you are there: 1. Come to San Francisco by Amtrak - Amtrak train comes to oakland and their thruway bus (must be booked with the ticket) goes on the Oakland Bay bridge into San Francisco. The views from the bay bridge cannot be matched esp. at night. They will drop you at Fisherman's wharf where you can walk to the hotel. 2. Ghirardelli Square: You get great views of Golden Gate and Alcatraz from here. Very charming and a must walk from the hotel. 3. Fisherman's wharf: Not much to do here unless you like seafood. Walgreens is very close by for grocery, souvenirs etc (come out of hotel, turn right and then a right again). There is a McDonalds, Burger king, Chipotle etc. I'm a vegetarian - so ate at Gino's pizza and Chipotle. Boudin bakery is a must see for their wonderfully shaped breads. 4. Walk along the piers all the way to Ferry Building: A great walk and lively in the evenings. You'll find many people jogging and the views are fantastic. The night time view of financial district and bay bridge from Pier 14 is superb. 1 hour walk from the hotel at a slow pace. 5. Muir Woods, Sausalito & Golden Gate: Get a tour company to take you there from the hotel. Wonderful redwood and a charming town in Sausalito. They normally give you an hour at each place. Muir woods is always damp - take an umbrella and warm clothes. If you get motion sickness, sit in the front seat. The road is windy. 6. Alcatraz : We did not get time to do this but it is worth visiting. 7. Walk on Lombard Street all the way to crookedest street: It is a hilly walk - so wear good shoes. You also get great views of the city from Coit tower and Telegraph hill. 8: Ferry building: very nice charming place with views of the bridge. The shops sell some really good gourmet stuff. Yerba Buena garden was also very nice. The hotel receptionist will give you a map and I would say - just walk. You'll love the city and the views. Tip: Stay away from Tenderloin i.e don't wander off Geary and Market street (esp. at night).", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and price\u201d", "Author": "Michel1030", "ReviewID": "UR120789573", "Content": "We stayed here for 4 nights while visiting our daughter and were very happy.

We selected the Holiday Inn Express for location. We wanted something in Fishermans Wharf area for convenience in exploring this area and nearby Chinatown via cable car. We've travelled to San Fran as a couple in the past and used public transport and/or rental car to get around from hotels in less expensive areas. San Fran is *very* hilly for walking and hard to park and drive in. Some areas are unsafe for walking at night as well and it's easy to underestimate the length of excursions. With prior knowledge of this, and a toddler in tow we decided to simplify the trip by paying a little more to stay in a good location for exploring a select set of sights and leave the car parked. Do not confuse this hotel with the nearby Holiday Inn - they are two different properties. The difference with an Express is that they do not provide the full range of hotel services (eg. no pool, no concierge etc.) However, this doesn't mean it is chintzy. It is still an impressive property and has vallet parking, a free breakfast buffet (good, lots of selection) and small but nicely appointed rooms. The decor was nice - sort of a nautical theme. Everything was very clean and new looking. The cost for any hotel in the Fishermans wharf area is out to lunch and we wanted a reliable brand name hotel for safety and cleanliness with our toddler. We paid a sum that would be considered a fortune for some other places but from research I know to be quite modest for this location. Hence the Holiday Inn express surpassed expectations. I might try the regular Holiday Inn next time because our little boy loves to have a swim when we are no vacation.

We saved the worst 'til last. The room was o.k. a good size and comfortable enough, didn't like having the coffee maker (but at least there is one!) in the bathroom so re located it. Wish Holiday Inns could provide bathrobes as we all have to travel so light when flying. As we were on 3rd floor we felt we could have used the stairs instead of hanging around for the lift but couldn't find them! Having travelled for a while we appreciated the laundry, would have appreciated it a lot more if one had been located on site instead of in the basement of the sister hotel up the road. They could also provide a few laundy baskets in there. Make sure you've got plenty of quarters if you want to use it, the receptionist did help me out with change. We also appreciated the business centre for free printing off of boarding passes, but free wifi in guest rooms would be so useful. The breakfast is held in a dark lobby with nasty mustard coloured net curtains, which add to the gloom, at the rear of the ground floor. It was a complete scrum so we didn't bother, the Hollywood Diner 3 mins down the road does a really good breakfast for a reasonable price. This hotel seems to cater for coach parties which maybe why the hotel breakfast is so over subscribed. The location of the hotel is quite handy although Fisherman's Wharf seems a lot more seedy than we remembered. San Francisco clearly has a big homeless problem, more than we noticed in other cities, with many sad & broken down drunk or drug addled people begging and sleeping on the streets.

As for the room, it was tiny with a lovely view of the roof and air ducts. \u00a0The bathroom was also tiny, with a toilet so \"low-flo\" that it took 2 or 3 flushes (so much for water conservation). \u00a0The bed was adequate and the room was quiet. The free breakfast buffet was also a big disappointment. \u00a0The breakfast area is extremely small, considering the number of rooms the hotel has. \u00a0And the food was blah, at best. \u00a0Better to walk around the corner to Denney's and spend a few dollars than fight the crowds in the dining room for a rubber egg, overcooked bacon, and a stale bagel.

Fabulous location \u2013 you can walk to Fisherman\u2019s Wharf, Pier 39, Ghiradelli Square, Powell Street cable car, F-Line street cars. City tours such as Hop On/Hop Off and Duck Tours are right around the corner. If parking was included in the room price this hotel would be a great value; however, parking is outrageous - $50+/night ($45 + $5 tax), then add more for tipping the valet. Apparently others have found cheaper parking nearby but the lots we saw didn\u2019t allow overnight parking and/or didn\u2019t allow in/out parking. If I had to do it all over again I wouldn\u2019t rent a car until we were ready to leave the city. Our rental car sat in the expensive parking garage for 2 days because with all forms of public transportation readily available we just didn\u2019t need it. Our 4th floor king room was an average size with no view (we looked into another hotel room so we had to keep the drapes closed when we were in the room). Room was very clean and quiet. Internet connection was nice to have but very slow. Missed having the mini fridge you get in most HI Express hotels, especially since there\u2019s a Safeway and a Trader Joes around the corner. Staff is very polite and helpful; however, I had to ask them to stop calling my room between 9:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. each night to ask how I was enjoying my stay. Nice gesture but a bit late! Minor negatives: 1) This hotel appears to cater to large school groups from the USA and abroad. At times there were large groups of unaccompanied minors wandering the halls, rough-housing, messing around with the elevators (one elevator was broken on 2 different days during our stay), etc. It was just kids being kids, but it appeared that some older guests were intimated by the groups of teens roaming around on the floors/taking over the elevators. 2) The free breakfast was terrible (eggs were inedible, OJ was like water with orange food coloring, bread/bagels were stale, milk tasted sour, etc. and even my favorite HI Express cinnamon rolls were not great). There are plenty of small breakfast places near the hotel (we tried Hollywood Caf\u00e9 and Pat\u2019s Cafe) but they aren\u2019t cheap. One exception is Caf\u00e9 Puccini in the Italian District - great breakfast omelets, lots of food, and very reasonable prices. Wish we had found it on our first day and not our last!

I can recommend the sticky buns and the coffee though. This hotel was also always very noisy very early in the morning. People going past in the corridor sreaming at six or seven in the morning every morning is not a good thing.

The hotel is located right at the heart of Fisherman's Wharf, which is convenient for tourists who want to take advantage of bus tours and sightseeing. My friend and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. Check in is at 3pm but we arrived at 12:30pm. We were told to return at 3pm and our reservation was confirmed. We came back at 3:10pm and were advised that our room had been given away to a large group of young students that were here as a group. They offered us a king size bed and a free movie to compensate. After a bit of haggling, we got upgraded to a mini suite for the duration of our stay, which was just a slightly larger room with 2 beds, a pullout couch, a microwave and mini fridge. I can only imagine how small the regular rooms must be. Despite the mixup, the staff was extremely helpful and friendly and quickly got us settled. For those travelers that don't like being in a touristy area then this hotel is not for you. For those that don't mind, the location is perfect. It is a very short walk to Ghiardelli Square, the crookedest street, and the Alcatraz ferry pickup. Also, there is free hotel pickup for the bus tours that we selected. If you don't know where to eat, you can walk along the pier and decide from a range of different places to eat. Most of the restaurants have a seafood theme so be prepared for crab and clam chowder on most of the menus. The buses, street cars, and cable cars are also a short distance from the hotel so you can explore the rest of the city quite easily. The only negative thing I would say about the location is the large amount of homeless people that appeared to be mentally ill. Walking back to the hotel at night was a bit worrisome for two young women as the homeless people sleep on the sidewalk on the walk back to the hotel. One man even approached us on the pier, rambling about something. We ignored them and were fine but it is a bit unsettling. The negative thing about the hotel would be the slow internet connection. There is a business centre with two computers and we had to wait in line most of the time that we wanted to check our e-mails. once you get a computer, you will be waiting for a few minutes for each page to load which can get frustrating. I suggest bringing a laptop or device that can access the computers and check the internet from the comfort of your room. And the people who were complaining about the breakfast are obviously too picky. There was a pretty good spread of FREE food ranging from cinnamon rolls, cereal, eggs, bacon, sausage, bagels, breads, english muffins, biscuits, oatmeal, bananas, yogurt, milk, coffee, and juice. The eggs were a bit rubbery but the rest was good. You can't ask for more at a free breakfast. All in all, I would recommend this hotel. It's clean, the staff are friendly and helpful, and the location is perfect if you are a tourist.", "Date": "March 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "WI", "Title": "\u201cFun in San Francisco!\u201d", "Author": "iscream4life", "ReviewID": "UR100448031", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Holiday Inn Express for four nights.

There is cereal, tea, coffee, milk, yogurt, bagels, fresh bananas etc. You can't beat free! I didn't eat the meat and eggs but was able to fill up on the heathier options. The breakfast bar is open from 6-9am. We didn't have a problem with crowds. There is free wifi in the lobby and the rooms. Our room was small (a king size bed) and there was no view, but we didn't spend alot of time there anyway. The room was clean and there was a safe for our use. The bed was comfortable. We could hear the cable cars through the window but over all it was pretty quiet. I think we got a really good deal and the people at the desk were very nice and helpful. The area is safe and seems to pick up especially on weekends. There is a place called Knuckles to eat at accross the street but it is over priced and not that great. Overall it was a very positive experience. A word of caution, Fisherman's Wharf is very touristy and there are a alot of homeless people in that area. Many of them are mentally ill.

The parking was expensive, so we returned the rental car for the 3 nights we stayed in San Francisco and caught cabs everywhere (given that there is nowhere to park a car in downtown SF for less than $50 per day) and found it to be very convenient and economical compared to the more expensive or dodgy areas near Union Square (which is where we really wanted to be). The cab fare for four of us was cheaper than buying bus or cable car tickets, not to mention the convenience of hailing a cab at the exact time we wished to travel. The hotel rooms were modern and quiet and the breakfast was adequate if you like cereal,/yogurt,/fruit and toast/muffins/cinnamon scrolls, but we advise you to steer clear of the hot food - highly processed and unpalatable for anyone who cares about their diet.

Fisherman's Wharf is low rise (this is 4 floors) near junk shops, boat tours and Ghiradelli Square. Not exactly classy, but most folks will get here sometime during a trip. The Sea Lions are a draw, and the Alcatraz boat is a short walk away. Advantage to this area is that most of these places are newer or recently renovated. Holiday Inn Express is 10 years old, and beginnning to show just a little wear. Wallpaper is coming loose at seams, tub needs a little work, but probably better than average shape for San Francisco as a whole. The Hyatt across the street is probably the nicest of the bunch, but all are pretty similar. Here the pluses are the breakfast included in the morning. I would rate average to slightly above for this type property, with bananas and yogurt every morning, as well as warm cinnamon rolls. Also, there were plenty of table to handle the off-season quantity of folks, although that may change in the summer. The internet in the rooms is provided through a cable hooked to your computer. In this day and age this seems antiquated, and frequently you get a pop-up on your screen about the service which is quite annoying. However, it is free internet, which is not always the case in San Francisco. Others have complained about looking out into a courtyard with just other rooms. We had a view of the street to the north, and the bay beyond. Only problem here is that on the 4th floor you are nearly even with the street lights, as well as the neon signs of many businesses. We had a tattoo shop behind glaring at us all night, a light that could not be blocked out by the curtains. Just be careful what you wish for. Overall we were very pleased with the accommodations. The cable car was 2 blocks away. We rented a GoCar a block away that was an absolute blast. There is an Enterprise rental car office 2 blocks away that we rented a car for a day trip to Napa. Hotel does not have a restaurant, but Hyatt across the street has a wine bar and a sports bar that we made good use of. Room was very nice, people were nice.

It's blocks from Fisherman's Wharf and close to the convention I attended at Fort Mason Center. Overall, the room was pretty good value for the money and location. However, my main complaint is the very strange set up of the hotel. It is almost like three separate hotels. There are two buildings across the street from each other. The second building is subdivided again into two separate spaces that have different entrances and you can only get from one section to the other by going outside. Once I checked into the main building, I had to drag my luggage across the street and go to the second building. It was very confusing which entrance to use, and if you went to the wrong one you had to go outside again to go to the other section. If you are in the section with the Denny's (like I was) the 'front desk' there isn't open all the time. So you have to go to one of the other buildings to get service. I dropped my bag off with the bell hop when they were open, and when I came back to get my bag that desk was closed. I had to call one of the other front desks to get any help, and it took repeated calls and at least 30-40 minutes before a bell hop appeared to help me. I was trying to catch a shuttle bus to the airport and the added wait made it very close. Further, it was confusing at which of the three possible entrances the shuttle was going to appear. So I was constantly checking back and forth to make sure I didn't miss it and no one was there to guide me otherwise.

The maids do a great job. They do try to do the \"conserve on towels and changing linens by request\" thing but just ask and they will give u more towels etc. The bed was very very comfortable. We had a quiet room (i think it was 212) it was not on the street side which I could see those rooms might be noisey, but we did not hear a peep. Towels and linens extremely clean and fresh. Breakfast had alot of options (very fresh bannanas everyone was eating them). They have an in room safe - make sure you use it because when we came back from dinner our window was open as if someone had been in our room (ODD) and this was a good while after the maids had been there but nothing seemed to be missing just dont leave anything valuable out. The front desk is very helpful with directions/transportation. Muir Woods was a disappointment, just a forest with a path, we thought trees would be more grand. Segway tours were really fun, but try to do when its not too cold. We took a day tour(this was our bus tour) and they did not give you enough time they would say \"you got 6 mins\" so take a shorter tour and dont take the 8 hr tours (comprehensive tours) or you feel gyped. The guy never shut up I just wanted to run away from the tour group cause no one wanted to hear his personal views, boring - I felt sad I had wasted a day being rushed to death so they could fit everything in - Im sure the hop on and hop off would be better so you could do it at your own pace. We spent over $100 and it was a waste, better to take bus and take your time. Go to the View Lounge at top of Marriott and you will have an awesome views of city at night, little couches cool lounge but be prepared to spend a little money. Pizza $16 for itty bitty pizza and $6 for beer(u can dress casual) - stick to a couple of cokes and enjoy the killer view. For the ladies - this China Town is not the same as New York - dont expect to find all the fake purses - we only found one store with those and 2 in fishermans wharf and not the selection - We heard they were raided and theres not barely any of that anymore. The Palace/Exploratorium was very pretty with a beautiful lake in front of it. The Japanese Tea Garden was very cute too and some days are even free admission. This hotel is within walking to a beach too great views - come out of hotel take a right- then very first right- then at intersection take a left and keep walking a few blocks and bam you are right there with plenty to do. Get a \"Fishermans Wharf pass\" they are like $60 a person and you can choose like 4 things to do, it would of saved us a ton of money if we had known about it - you can a good selection to choose from - from tours to Go cars, to alcatraz etc -u will need to look up online where to get them cause there is a ton of tour places. Sausalito is a cute town wish i could of seen it more but was rushed to death so it was a blur to me on my tour. Union Square was hopping if you are into upscale shopping. My husband loved the chowder get it from the vendor right a Fishermans Wharf sign where you can just get a cup and he said it was great and it was half the price of it at some restaurants. We had a great time but remember you walk alot even if you do take the bus but the Wharf is flat so nothing to worry about there. The hotel will call for a taxi. If you want more of a retro/upscale restaurants go down towards the ferry buillding they have alot of yuppies down there and the places looked pretty cool right on the bay. Hotel will bring you a fridge if you request it - tell them its to store medication in and its free - if not u pay $20/day - u will need it - get drinks from walgreens right around the corner - at night you are tired as heck so u need to have some stored up. You can print your own boarding passes there too and they have a couple of computers to check your emails. We had a king size bed, which we prefer and the rooms was a decent size for us two. They have everything you need here and if you are feeling poor - In and Out burgers, Burger King and Macdonalds are just around the corner. For couples if you plan on dressing up alot there is a revolving restaurant we found out about at the top of the Hyatt, we did not go but heard it was nice. I think you will be happy with the location but whatever you do wear comfortable shoes and bring decent socks. They say dress in layers and they are so right. Almost all sweatshirts they sell are $15-$19 dollars they sell alot of windbreakers at the gift shops for $20. My husband got a major SF jacket for $20 wish we could of bought more fleece jackes and coats because they are so cheap but we couldnt fit them in luggage. Again people be comfortable the day really wears you out but you feel anxious to get up early cause there are so many fun things to see and do.

On booking in I asked if we had a twin room as I was with my Mum. We were booked into a double. Despite the busy day the receptionist could not have been nicer! She initially told us that they were full and that we could have a roll away bed. Then she commented that we were there for a week and should be better looked after and found us a twin room. The hotel is just a couple of minutes walk from Fishermans Wharf in one direction and the cable car turning table in another. The Market Street trolley goes from a block away taking you right up to the vicinity of Union Square. And that costs just $2 each. The room was fantastic. Immaculately clean, in good condition and with good facilities. Mum was pleased to get a good quality coffee from the machine in the bathroom. The shower was good and the beds extremely comfortable. Breakfast is part of the cost. Obviously not amazing and more of a buffet style. There is a hot breakfast with scrambled eggs and bacon. I personally found these rather hideous but everyone else seemed to eat them. Their cinnamon rolls were to die for though and there was plenty of choice for breakfast cereal. I was a little surprised that there was no Wifi in the rooms although this was available in the lobby. There is internet access in the rooms but via a cable so you would need a lap top.

She helped us out during our stay when we decided to move to a family suite and made the transition as smooth as possible.

The breakfast was pretty good, one day had more selections then the other, but still enough for everyone in the family to get filled up. We ate at Boudins (Fishermen's Wharf) and had some great meals upstairs. Downstairs is a cafe with some nice sandwiches and salads for something quick and cheap. If you walk down a couple of blocks towards Ghiradelli Square there is a Cold Stone, we had that for dessert most nights. We had been to San Francisco before and drove around but we wanted to hear more about the city so we went on a organized tour through Great Pacific. My husband and I and our 13 yr old really enjoyed this, we learned so much and our driver was great. He remembered everyone's names and answered all our questions, I think his name was Malcolm. I would highly recommend it. We also went on a free walking tour of Chinatown, I enjoyed it, but my kids got a little antsy. (It was very cold that morning) Volunteers lead walking tours all over San Francisco for free, just look around on the internet, they really know the city. The Pacific Heights mansion tour looked interesting but we didn't have the time. The family suite was very large and we loved the free internet.

Once they stop putting out fresh food your selection goes down FAST! I would suggest getting there before 8:30 if you want a good hearty breakfast.

The young lady at the desk, expecting a baby...I don't recall her name, was highly professional, extremely pleasant, quite honestly one of the nicest front desk encounters we've ever had...and we've stayed in many hotels in San Francisco.

Sufficent elevators, while the floors are decorated in a cruise ship atmosphere/motif with porthole style windows and railings. Quiet, spacious hallways. Our room, a king deluxe, was on an upper floor, facing inside. The room was small to fair in size, not as typically small as San Francisco hotel rooms can be, but I wouldn't have wanted the room to be any smaller. My only disappointment in the room was the inside facing view. The building is accordioned and therefore, we looked out onto another wall of the building, and a small narrow outside utility corridor. ...it was a tad claustrophobic, so we just ignored that aspect. Our room was well insulated, quiet, newly decorated, lovely bathroom...small granite counter, large floor space in the bathroom and dressing area, lovely towels. Small mirror, cruise ship motif, over the smallish granite counter and sink. Very nice linens. An added plus was a keyed safe in the room for our valuables. Smallish closet with mirrors. The usual amenities. Of course the value in the Holiday Inn Express is the morning breakfast. It was well stocked with surprisingly varied items...from cereal, fresh fruit and yogurt to hot entrees of french toast, scrambled eggs and sausage with numerous beverage choices...plenty of small tables with comfortable seating, even around the fireplace. Very pleasant. Free and readily available internet in a private alcove off the lobby, for research, web surfing, and airline boarding passes. The hotel is located one block from a Muni Stockton 30 bus stop at Columbus and half a block to Muni 47...the North Point and Van Ness line. A block or two from the cable cars, Fisherman's Wharf, and an easy walk to the Irsh Coffees at the Buena Vista. :) As well, close to Barnes and Noble, Safeway, and car rental agencies...

The hotel staff was very knowledgeable about what bus to take and/or how to best get to an area. The free breakfast consisted of eggs (scrambled or omelet style), sausage (links or patties), bread (bagels, english muffins, white, wheat), cereal, bananas, milk, yogurt, juices, coffee, and sweet rolls. The breakfast area does get crowded especially around the four toasters. Hey, it is a free breakfast! I didn't mind the wait. The only downside is the tv has a few channels.

There was a good selection to get your day started - juice, coffee, tea, milk, cereals, toast, bagels, yogurt, bananas, eggs (either scrambled or omlette which seemed to be prepacked and microwaved), bacon and/or sausage. The hotel was full on the weekend and the breakfast bar was quite busy at times. I felt the hotel did a great job of refilling things and we never had to wait long for anything. We always also managed to find a table for our group of 4. There were a couple of minor things we noted. While the hotel looked great, it is very basic and didn't have any nice little \"extras\". I thought it would have been nice to have coffee/tea service in the lobby area throughout the day, not just until 9:30 am - we've had this at other Holiday Inn Express hotels and basic type hotels such as Quality Inns, etc. Some aspects of service could have been a little better as well. I wanted to have a tea in my room early one evening. I had forgot to take a milk back up to the room in the morning - tea with powdered whitener just isn't that great. I had hoped that the front desk could get me a milk - the breakfast room was just a few steps away - but they were unable to help as their \"house man\" was not on duty. While I was waiting at the front desk an older man approached and indicated that they had just returned from their day out and their room hadn't been cleaned. The gentleman at the front desk indicated that he \"couldn't understand how that could happen, it had never happened before\". He asked the guest if he was sure he didn't leave his Do Not Disturb sign on the door. The guest replied he was sure he hadn't. The front desk clerk then proceeded to tell the gentlemant there was nothing he could for him as the cleaning staff were gone for the day and again, the house man was not in. The front desk clerk didn't offer anything to the guest for the inconvenience - he just restated he couldn't understand how that could happen. To me, surely someone could have gone up and emptied the garbages and at least gave them clean towels? Also, don't forget that parking is very expensive, as is pretty standard with wharf area hotels.

I wanted to fill the weekend with fun things to do since I have not been to California before. This stay started off by waiting to check in for 15 minutes while the person working the check in desk went through every possible thing to do in San Francisco with a couple. By the time she was done with them, the check in line was 4 people deep. I stay at numerous Holiday Inn's and I am a Priority Club Platinum member so I asked if they had any Platinum upgrades. The person behind the desk stated that they did have something available and that she would upgrade me. After we got that taken care of I asked her about the parking situation. They are extremely close to the Fisherman's Wharf I was figuring that they would have free parking for guests or at maximum $10-$20 charge. I find out that the only parking that they have available is valet parking that costs $41 plus applicable taxes that brings the total over $45!!! I asked the person behind the counter if there are any other options, and she stated that she used to tell people to go down the block because they were only $20. She continued to say that now the prices have gone up, and that they are no longer that cheap. No other follow up was done with me. She stated that they do not own the parking area, so that there were no breaks for Platinum members or anyone else for that matter. I over heard the poor lady next to me telling the other family that she was traveling with that the charge is $50 a day per car. They had 2 cars staying for 2 days. That is an extra $200!!! Afterward I did see that there is a $41 Valet Parking charge on their website after I dug around a little bit, and I would have figured that they would have other options than valet parking. I never do valet parking, so I figured that I would just park in the local ramp. Like I have stated I travel a lot for business, and nothing has caught me so off guard as paying 1/3 of the amount that I paid for a room in parking. I was unfamiliar with the area, and I did not feel comfortable driving around trying to find another place to park. To be fair there are numerous hotels around along with this one in this area, and I believe that they all charge close to this much for parking. After the whole parking shocker, I went up to the \"upgraded\" room. I had originally booked a normal room with a king bed. The \"upgraded\" room had 2 queen beds. Apparently the \"upgrade\" means that you get a microwave and an extra small sink. No refrigerator or anything else that would constitute \"upgrade\" in my book. I went back down to the desk and got my room back with the king bed. I figure that is pretty bad that after an upgrade you go back to the original room that you originally had. The room I had was extremely tiny, and the view out of the window was another room in the hotel. Overall decor in the hallways in the rooms was nice, but absolutely nothing over the top or even special for that matter. If you are thirsty go to the Walgreens up the road since bottled water and other beverages in the vending machine start at $3.00. I had to go down and exchange a towel since it was dirty. Only 2 bath towels were given in the room, so if there is more than one person that wants to take more than one shower you need to use wet towels. The bed makes a funny noise when I sit on it. I do not know what else to say about this, but I wanted to note it. They had wired internet in the room that I was in. I was able to find a wireless signal from this hotel and I called down to the desk to get the access code, and the person that answered stated wireless internet is not available in the rooms. I continued to tell her that it is asking for my Holiday Inn Express access code and she then proceeded to tell me what the pass code is. This just added to the frustration. Overall it really started off on the wrong foot realizing that I had to pay almost $50 just to park, and it really did not get any better. Due to the times I really wanted to stay fiscally responsible for my business trip, and this extra charge took me way over the acceptable costs for a hotel room. Now I am going to have to explain this situation to my supervisors and try and justify the extra charges. I am currently writing this review the night that I am staying at this hotel. I am taking time out of my trip on Friday night to warn people of what they may walk into with this hotel. There is no pool, but they allow you to use the pool from the adjacent Holiday Inn hotel. Like I have stated I travel a lot for business and I stay at Holiday Inn brand hotels 50+ times throughout the year. This one is absolutely the lowest value for the dollar that I have stayed in. The location is nice, but if you are planning on staying more than one night be aware you may be dishing out close to $100 for parking.

Our room was cleaned daily to a very high standard, it was extremely clean and the bathroom was probably one off the best I have experienced in a hotel. The towels were changed when ever you needed them. The bed linen was changed regularly and the bed must have been at least seven foot wide. For the first three days we didnt eat breakfast in the hotel allthough it was supplied free with our room.. But after spending over 30dollars for two outside the hotel, we decided to try the hotel breakfast. It was fine. It wasnt as overcrowded as I had previously read about on this forum. We always found a table, and the food was certainly good. My husband managed to get bacon or sausage with scrambled eggs or ommeletes every morning. The hotel is perfectly situated for fishermans wharf, to my mind one of the nicest areas of S.F. It is so close to the cable car turn-around. I would so recommend this hotel to anyone. We travelled on a package with Virgin, but I'm sure we could have got it cheaper if we had booked the flight and hotel indepenty. One place the Virgin reps really try to push is a diner called Denny's, I must say we tried it a couple off times, but would not recommend it, it seems to serve mainly junk food.

Can take back to room too. - Nice room, no problems with maid service/cleaniness etc. - all excellent. - Plenty of shuttle bus companies from SF airport to FW area - anywhere from $11 - $17 each way. Look for coupons on the hotel map flyers to book your return shuttle. - For souvenier shopping, I would suggest check out Chinatown FIRST, then stroll to Fisherman's Wharf. Generally, Chinatown is cheaper and has the same range. - For tours, I went with Gray Line through San Francisco Sightseeing Tours. I took the Muir Woods tour (with ferry back from Salsolito) and the Yosemite tour. Both very good. If I could only pick one, it would be Yosemite. - Book your Alcatraz tour through the offifical website - about $26 US. Really worth seeing and the audio tour is great. On the audio tour, skip following the official route and work your own way around - you can still listen and get the general idea and miss the crowds. - Take the walk from the hotel to the GG Bridge. Allow about an hour there and an hour back. Completely flat trail along the bay and then a stepped climb for the last part next to the bridge. You'll know it was worth it! - If you're vegetarian/vegan there are plenty of places to eat in SF - way more than other cities I've visited. - Cable car ride (must do!) is $5 regardless of trip length.

We were only at this location for 2 nights, and we did get a ground floor room. There was a little street noise, I would recommend asking for a higher room if this would bother you. The desk at our building was open almost all the time and the employees were very helpful. We had to fax some papers for our balloon ride and something was not working. She tried and tried. She would not give up, even called the company and finally got the papers faxed. We did not eat in the restaurant in the hotel, because we have a strict rule for not going to any type of chain restaurant while visiting other cities,. The location was perfect to visit the Fisherman's Wharf area. There is a most wonderful (5 stars out of 5) restaurant just down the block called Beach Street Grill.

You can walk to pretty much anywhere within 5 mintues, including Pier 39 and cable car turnarounds. It is on North Point Street, a fairly quite street from our experience. Our room overlooked the street, and we had absolutely no complaints about road noise, or noise from other rooms for that matter. We were on the 4th (top) floor, right at the end of the corridor, which must have helped keep noise levels down. With only 4 floors, there was never a long wait for the elevator.

As a Priority Club member, i have stayed in several 5-stars Intercontinental, Crowne Plaza and 4-stars Holiday Inn during my business and leisure trips thoughout Asia. This hotel is the first HI-Express i am staying in (not many HI-Express franchises in Asia), but since i am on a vacation and paying my own hotel bills, i don't mind and had no expectations whatsoever. I booked on the basis of the photos posted on the hote's website. When i arrived, i was pleasantly surprised by the clean and well kept condition of the place. It looks new and very well maintained, from the lobby to the elevators and to the rooms. Requested for a Alcatraz facing room and request was met. Great ! The room is fairly alright for 2 persons, and very typical of the Holiday Inns i have stayed throughout Asia. The shower/toilet was cleaned. The room provides free wired internet and Playstation console. I guess the concept of HI-Express is minimal service and facilities. So that way, they keep cost down and room rates affordable. I paid about US$90 per night and i would say its a great deal considering the clean and well maintained room, the free self serve continental breakfast and the free internet. If what u need is a good room and safe hotel to sleep in, this is it. If you like to lounge around the hotel in the day, require a swimming pool. fitness centre or a bar in the evening, try the Hyatt across the road or Sheraton around the corner. My wife and I were there for a vacation, so we returned to the room past 10pm and out the next day by 10am. So we are happy with the price and quality. Good location too. The last stop of the tram is a short walk away, and so is the pier where u can see the crab stalls. The free train ride to Union Sq is also just round the corner, and getting to ferry terminal to Alcatraz is a 8 minutes pleasant walk. Lots of food options around, from burgers to cafes. I enjoyed my 3 nights stay there.

I was able to see both Alcatraz Island and the Golden Gate Bridge from my room, so that was cool. I believe it was room 565. There is a Walgreen's drug store one block from the hotel so that made stocking up on water and forgotten items easy and affordable. We did not rent a car and took taxi's or public transportation. The taxi from the airport (SFO) was $50 including a nice tip. A taxi to union square is $10 from the hotel. About $15 to the downtown financial district. We love the garlic crab at the Crab House on pier 39. We ate there twice. We went to a Giants game at AT&T Park. We shopped at Union Square and Chinatown. All were fun. The Holiday Inn has 2 buildings. The one with the Denny's is about 1 block East of the Main Building. Both are well located to all the stuff in the area. We go to SF every couple of years and the Holiday Inn was comparable to the other chain hotels in FW. Some are a little closer to Pier 39 if that matters to you (5 minute walk instead of 10.)

We settled on the Holiday Inn Express after trolling through the many reviews on the different hotels in the Fisherman's Wharf area, and I'm happy to say it fit the bill exactly. If you're looking for a hotel with lots of history and character, don't come here. However, if all you need is a comfortable bed, a quiet room, a safe location and friendly service it's perfect. Previous reviews had also mentioned asking for a room facing the courtyard to minimise noise - I included this when making my internet booking, and our wish was granted, with our room also being on the top floor. Our flight from Australia was scheduled to arrive around 10.30am, but a quick call to the hotel a couple of days before confirmed they had a luggage room if we needed to kill a couple of hours before check-in. Imagine our surprise and pleasure when, on arriving at the hotel around midday, we were given our room straight away. The hotel has a free business centre near reception, with two PCs with internet access, plus a printer. There's also a breakfast area on the ground floor, with a free continental breakfast included in the price. It's not exactly gourmet, and our first experience there was a little overwhelming as a large school group were staying - enough said! However, the Hollywood Cafe a couple of doors down did a great lunchtime BLT, so I'd imagine their breakfast was pretty good too. There's a pretty good sports bar/restaurant right across the street, plus there's also a Safeway and a Walgreens a block or so east on North Point.

Stayed for four nights in room 483 and 485 (the fourth floor is the top floor so this is not a huge place). There was no view as you are sandwiched in between hotels and other buildings but we didn't come to sit in the room. We paid $62/night through hotwire.com on a rather last-minute trip and this was an extraordinary value for this normally $200+ night hotel. The hotel looks like it is brand new!! It is probably the cleanest, best maintained hotel we've stayed in and we've stayed in a lot, including upscale five star establishments! The furniture, furnishings, linens, beds ... everything ... top notch and in perfect working and very comfortable condition. The staff, including the maids, are all very friendly and helpful. The new hot breakfast is very good and saves a ton of $ on breakfast every morning. The only complaint - well, a couple complaints, is it isn't very hot. The hot items are lukewarm at best and the variety is the same every day. Some pancakes or waffles would be a nice touch as not everyone enjoys biscuits and gravy (a daily offering). The other complaint that really doesn't have as much to do with the hotel is the other guests - every morning we had pushy, rude people crowding in trying to cut in line, like a bunch of pigs waiting for food at the trough. The thing the hotel could do to mitigate this is re-think the way the breakfast is set up. Logistically it could be set up in a better way to avoid people crowding in. It is fantastic that they provide a hot breakfast, it is good and the gentlemen manning the breakfast ensure there is never anything empty, they do a very nice job. A nice touch are the two free computers they provide in the lobby for internet use. They are even hooked up to printers which was great to be able to print out city maps etc. They do get busy though and the waiting line can be long. The hotel location is perfect and so close to everything you'd want to do. We didn't have a car to worry about the exorbanant parking charges; we took the 'Go Lorries' airport shuttle both to/from the airport which worked out wonderfully. We walked everywhere or used the 3-day MUNI passes we purchased for $18 to ride the cable cars, streetcars and bus system all over SF. The passes were well worth the money.

We have never had to pay to park our car in a hotel we are guests in and found it a totally unreasonable charge. After our first night we found that we could park on the road on a meter from 7pm to 7am for free outside the front of the hotel and then moved the car into a $10 car park for the day.

The bed was amazingly comfortable - if only we could have sneaked it home in our cases. the free breakfast was wonderful. especially considering it was free. There was plenty of room to sit, plenty of food, and it was replenished through the morning (during the set hours) There were plenty of healthy options available too. It certainly set us up for the day, and nobody seemed to mind us taking fruit with us (for a mid-morning power snack!) . The staff were polite, helpful and willing to help when we needed assistance.

Around the corner there are many tourist shops selling everything a tourist could hope to buy. We also rented bikes for a day from a store here. The hotel is a fairly modern block, although the outside looks very Art Deco, and the room we had was reasonably spacious, clean and well decorated. A king size bed, TV, table and chair are in the main area. The bathroom has a bath, with shower, toilet, sink and hairdryer. A coffee pot is also provided. If it\u2019s important to you, make sure you request a room with an outside view as our room looked out onto an internal blank space although we had a view of the sky to see the weather (rooms with an outside view won\u2019t have much of a view anyway just onto the road). Our room was located on the 1st floor (2nd to North American readers) and, annoyingly, the only stairways we could find were all marked as being emergency exits only.

It's a relaxed hotel, and I felt far more comfortable staying at the Holiday Inn Express than I did at the Fairmont to be honest, and it's cleaner than the Fairmont too.

A closet safe, TV, table and chairs, coffee maker, thick towels, internet access, hair dryer and all the stuff that we have come to expect in most of the better hotels enhances our stay. We're off and running. Two easy blocks, slightly downhill to the Fisherman's Wharf. Strolling, observing, stopping for snacks. I even got pulled into a street performance. They needed a slightly overweight, big guy, to pick up the girl and stand on the performers chest as he laid in broken glass. My daughter was slightly embarrassed by the whole thing but my wife was cracking up. We ate well, spent a little more than normal in the tourist trap, but for the most part it was very good... My wife is partial to fish and crab.. and the wharf is a good place to find it The next day, after the continental breakfast, (which we all loved and felt was quite complete and generous) we decided to take the bus to the Union Square for shopping. $1.50 a head, with free transfer. We rode thru the Chinese area on the way. Many older ladies got on with their shopping bags and gossiped at breakneck speed. As we passed, I noticed the stores selling food were jammed. I felt transported to a crowded Asia. I quietly commented to my Asian wife that she will look right at home on this bus in a few years chatting with all the old ladies.. That comment was overheard by the lady sitting across from us who laughed out loud upon hearing it. We chatted with her and had some laughs. We had fun shopping in the stores. Macy's has 7 floors on each side of the street, 7 for men, 7 for women. That was pretty cool.. I bought my wife a nice gift. A reasonable $10 fare to take us taxi back to the hotel.. We rested, then strolled some more, all jacketed and ready for the cold San Francisco nights. We slept well that night and came home safely. The hotel served it's purpose more than adequately. The location, the full continental breakfast, and the cleanliness of the room stand out in my mind. The beds were sturdy and comfortable.. The staff was friendly and helpful. The only negative is those damn parking fees in SF, $35 a night plus tax. We could have saved about 7-10 dollars a night by parking off site and walking but it wasn't really worth it to me.

Seemed to have a good location, competitive price, and is fairly new. I found the best deal by pre-paying directly on the hotel website and even chose a mini-suite as it would be myself, my wife, and my two young boys so I wanted a little extra room. So, check-in went fine and the valet parking was great. $35 + tax per day with in/out priviliges. The hotel is decorated well and is very clean. The hallways are very wide and, overall, the 'feel' is very appealing. Once we found our room (4th floor overlooking the wharf) I was a bit disappointed. The mini-suite means that there is a fold-out couch sitting in the window area and an area is setup with sink, mini-fridge, microwave. I do admit that the kitchenette area was good to have, but the room itself was not much larger than a normal room. I was expecting a bit more I guess - oh well. Once we unpacked I noticed that the walls were VERY thin. I could hear the TV from the room next to us, water running from what seemed to be every bathroom, and the noise from people in the hall was overwhelming. This was a huge turn-off for us. I realize that you get noise when you are in a hotel but this was a bit extreme. The next morning we went down for the Continental Breakfast. This is definitely nice to have, although the quality of the food was not that great. You cannot expect too much for a Continental Breakfast so take these comments as just that, comments. Check-out went smoothly, we were able to extend our check-out until 2pm, which was good as we were tired and didn't need to leave for the airport until 2:00.

You do not need to rent a car because you have all the transportation around you needed at all times of the day and night. We also took numerous tours which picked us up in front of the hotel. If you decide to rent a car the rate per night at the hotel w/tax is approx. $42.00. The Holiday Inn Express is very clean and unusually large and soundproof. The beds should be upgraded because they have seen many years of abuse. We used our points and did not have to pay anything and were put in a mini suite which included a fridge and microwave. The view was of the Wharf from our room but being we were on the run the entire week it was a pleasure to come back and leave from that location. The breakfast could be better and maybe more of it being you have a lot of people from other countries who took advantage of filling bags for dessert - I blame this on all of San Francisco who charge ridiculous prices for all food especially breakfast. I was told Denny's around the corner charged for 3 people an average of $72.00. New York is much cheaper than this City. Also, the homeless are out of control every place you walk in the best of areas they are begging, trying to touch you and sleeping in the streets. In fact they are out of control and make it very uncomfortable because no police and very little security around. They are even outside of the hotels but I felt fine because I had my husband and 15 year old son with me. If I was alone it would not be enjoyable. When you stand on the line for the Trolley Cars they are grabbing on to you and begging. Every park, every landmark, every place there are tons and tons of them even sleeping on the Trolly's before they roll out in the AM. I was interested in taking one of the Trolley's and stepped on the bus because I thought one of them worked for the transit and almost got cornered by 4 of them until my husband came behind me. This City is NOT SAFE for single women. I think they need to stop protecting them and clean up San Francisco because it is a beautiful place to visit. Everyone we met felt the same way in fact one women from England went to the baseball Giant Game the same night we attended and 3 of these homeless men sat next to them and every time they moved the homeless followed them until one fell and split open his chin and was bleeding but refused help and paramedics left the scene. I called them bums and almost got my head chopped off by many of the tour guides that we took trips with. One place we stopped to take a picture I walked with my son ahead of my husband and he felt someone right behind him when he picked up the bag that we were carrying and thought it was me but instead had a homeless right in his face.

The street side rooms may have a view, but they are very noisy with traffic. Wasn't a huge deal as we use the room only for cleaning up and sleeping.

I've only stayed in a room with a street view once, with all other rooms facing interior courtyards. The good news is that these rooms are quiet, while the street view rooms have heavy traffic noice. The bad news is that there is no view in a city famous for great views. Holiday Inn Express offers the same breakfast at every property I've stayed at. It gets the job done, but don't expect anything fancy. Coffee, cold cereal, toaster waffles/english muffins, cinamon rolls, and an orange colored liquid that claims to be juice. If you are driving a car, be prepared to pay a $40 daily charge to park it at the hotel. High priced parking is pretty standard at all San Francisco hotels, but can be a shocker if you aren't prepared for it. Want a restaurant recommendation? Try Pompei's Grotto.

Firstly, this hotel has extremely hard beds even with the extra mattress pad that they provide. If there is one thing you do in San Francisco is a lot of walking and a good nights comfortable sleep is an important factor. When we crawled into bed the first night we noticed how hard the mattress was. I was trying to get comfortable and my arm rubbed over the blanket. To my dismay I felt crusty areas on the blanket as it rubbed against my arm. Without getting into specifics you can guess why the blanket had crusty stains on it and was not clean, it even had a few dirt marks on it too. We stripped the blanket off the bed and we saw that there was a spare blanket in the closet, so we used that one instead. The next day, we reported the dirty blanket to the front desk, along with our TV having a continous buzzing noise too. The gal at the front desk said she would have to talk to the manager about the situation. When I spoke to the manager, she said she told the maid to check the sheets and they were clean. I told her it was not the sheets, but the blanket. She had an odd reaction (sort of like disbelief) she said, \"this has never happened here before.\" To which I replied, \"we travel all over the world and believe me this has never happened to us either.\" The manager also mentioned that the blankets are not washed on the same wash cycle as the sheets. She said, she would investigate the blanket problem and adjust our room rate for that night. Which ended up being a few dollars off the nightly room rate. We were moved to another room. The new room was clean, there was no problem with the bedding. We asked for an extra mattress pad to be put on the bed, this made the bed more comfortable to sleep on. Had it not been for the two mattress pads on the bed, we would have found the bed too hard and uncomfortable to sleep on and would have checked out, to find another hotel with a more comfortable bed. The coffee maker in the room is on the bathroom counter right beside a high powered flushing toilet. This is not sanitary considering the splashes from the toilet so close by. We washed the coffee maker out with hot water and soap and moved it to the desk by the TV. I'm not sure why they are not placed there in the first place, as there is plenty of room on the desk beside the TV. The coffee supplied in your room is very weak. I think the coffee supplied is for 2 cups, not for 4 cups. If your making a full pot use both packages of coffee, then it will taste a lot better. The maid service was very efficient, although they start at 8:30am, so if you want to sleep in you should put the \"do not disturb\" sign on the door. Rush hour starts at 6:00am, so if you are a light sleeper and wake up to traffic, bus and cable car noise, ask for a room facing the courtyard. It has no view, but these rooms are quieter than the street side. There are two computers in the lobby that offer free internet, but a lot of times they are busy in the mornings. We found that the computers had better availability in the afternoons and evenings. The complementary continental breakfast is served from 6:30am to 9:30am. This consists of cold boiled eggs, bran muffins, chocolate muffins, apple muffins, croissants, white & brown bread, english muffins (toasters are available for toasting bread) butter and jam. Plain donuts, chocolate donuts, cinnamon buns, raisin bran cereal, cornflakes cereal, fruit loops cereal, (skim, 2%, homo milk) orange, apple, cranberry juice, coffee, tea, plus fresh fruit - apples, bananas & oranges. The breakfast lull is about around 7:30am to about 8:15am. It is much busier earlier and later. The hotel is conveniently located walking distance to Pier 39. Cable cars, street cars, bus stops are close by. The cab ride from the airport to the hotel costs about $42.00. The parking rate at the hotel is $35.00 per day. We decided to forego the rental car and parking fee. We did not regret this decision as the bus service is very efficient, we only waited 5 minutes for a bus on any given day including Sunday. 15 minutes at the most for a cable car or street car. At the end of the cable car stations in a booth you can purchase a one day Municipal Transit pass (Muni) good for all buses, cable cars and street cars for $11.00. A three day pass costs $18.00 and a 7 day pass costs $24.00. The passes are excellent value, as a one way cable car ride costs $5.00 and you can not hop on and off either. $5.00 for each ride period. There are two supermarkets located close to the hotel. Safeway and Trader Joe's. We found Trader Joes brand sparkling fruit juices able to hold their fizz the next day, as there is no fridge in your hotel room. The plus they taste good too. Walgreens and Cost Plus World market are near by also, but have a more limited food selections. Other retail shops/malls open @ 10:00am. We found that souveniers are cheaper closer to the hotel and China Town then at Pier 39. Ghiradelli square is under renovations until Spring 2007 and Fall 2007 so only about 1/4 of the shops are open there. The second last night of our trip, teenagers were partying with a loud boombox next door @ 2:00am.

We arrived from Las Vegas so at first were slightly disappointed (we had a suite in the Luxor and had been spoilt) but the hotel was perfect for what we wanted. The hotel boasts a central location, I would say Fishermans Wharf is the 'tourist' area with plenty of souvenir shops etc, also a lot of seafood restaurants to choose from as well as the usual, Rain Forest Cafe, McDonalds etc..... Check in was smooth, we were allocated a room on the front but the AC did not work so we asked to move and were placed at the back which was much better, no noise at all. Once settled in we were extremely pleased. Guests at the hotel can use the outdoor pool at the neighbouring Holiday Inn for free. We never got the chance! The breakfast was excellent, plenty of cereal, toast, muffins, doughnuts, fruit, tea, coffee, juice, all very fresh and plenty of it and this was available 6.30-9.30. The later you went down however the busier it was but still plenty of seats. The area is great for catching the cable car/bus and I would highly recommend this hotel. All hotels seemed the same standard in the area, there were the more exclusive hotels in the City Centre (Hilton, Mark Hopkins, Francis Drake, Marriott etc) but for what we needed it was perfect. San Francisco is a fab city and Alcatraz is a must but be sure to book in advance. We also found the all day cable car pass $11 each to be very worth while. Shopping is a must here and you can pick up some fantastic bargains, whatever you are into!! - the only disappointing thing was the GG park did not seem to be too accesible, and we were curious as to how as this seems to be quite a large area to visit, we hired some bikes and cycled to the GG bridge, very good value for money and lock and helmet supplied which meant you could have lunch, or have a look round the souvenir shops.

There are around a dozen large hotel-chain properties all situated within an area of a few blocks so whether you stay at the HI Express, Sheraton, Hyatt, etc etc you'll more or less be staying in the same area. The main drawback is that the location is two blocks back from the Wharf area and the immediate vicinity isn't exactly a pleasant one. Pier 39 is a great place for a stroll, grab a meal and browse the shops. The area around the Cannery, Ghiradelli Square & the Cable-Car turnaround is also nice. It's the few blocks in between these areas however that make the Wharf un-savoury. A concentration of very tacky souvenir stores and one-too-many colourful characters spoil the area although we still felt happy that we'd chose the Wharf as our base. We were originally planning a stay at the Westin on Union Square and whilst we saw that the hotel itself was very grand we weren't convinced that staying smack-bang in the centre of the city would have been a better option. Every one of the 4 days we spent in the city involved starting things off within ten minutes of our hotel - whether it be Alcatraz, a superb city tour or cycling over the GG Bridge. The major gripe we had with the area was how early everything closed on Pier 39. We expected to be able to browse the shops, etc after dinner each night but from 10pm onwards the whole area closes up and you're left with the choice of having a drink in one of the few restaurant bars or returning to your hotel. The hotel itself is very modern and spotlessly clean. Certainly no character and most of the rooms face into central courtyards but if it's a new hotel with good standards that you look for this hotel is ideal. The rooms weren't large but fine, especially for a city hotel and the shower, room temperature, furniture etc were all great, as was the buffet breakfast included in the price. All-in-all our 4 days in San Francisco were brilliant, taking in some memorable experiences. If you want a very clean, modern hotel and can get a good rate at the Holiday Inn Express I'd recommend staying here and using it as a base. NB - Some people mix up the adjacent Holiday Inn with the Express - the normal HI is a lot older and I'd definitely opt for the Express over it. We did like the look of the Sheraton however although all the hotels were similar in the area.", "Date": "July 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Evergreen, CO", "Title": "\u201cTypical Holiday Inn\u201d", "Author": "MHS8874", "ReviewID": "UR5488689", "Content": "We spend 5 days at the hotel.

The free breakfast in the morning was a big plus in the rate, except I've seen better selections at other Holiday Inn Express'we have stayed at. I didn't like the big bins of cereal.

We liked the hotel mainly because of the location, close to Fisherman's Wharf, cable cars, bus stops and shopping. The Hotel was very clean, modern, quiet at night and the continental breakfast was a great way to start the day. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We had booked 3 sightseeing tours with Super Sightseeing Tours and enjoyed them very much. Their office is less than 1/2 a block from the Hotel main entrance.

Nice bathroom, towels, lots of room. When we first got to our room, I asked a housekeeper for additional pillows and a blanket. He had it to us in less than 10 minutes! Many places we've stayed at take forever to get you these items, if they even have them. The only thing I would recommend here is new beds. They were small (full)....queens would be much nicer, and they were not very firm. Breakfast was included each morning which had been a deciding factor for us. One less meal to pay for in a pretty expensive town! It was very good, with lots of choices including hard boiled eggs, cereals, cinnamon rolls, etc.... Lobby and breakfast room was always full, but the staff kept up with refills and were very friendly. Such a treat to have a smiling face in the morning!! It was fun to be in the midst of so many other travelers each morning. In fact, we met up with someone from our hometown who just raved about the hotel also! Front desk staff was very helpful with questions and directions. No problems with checking in or out. We inquired about an upgrade to a suite and were told that none were available, but she quickly offered to supply us with a refrigerator or cot if needed. On another note, we would highly recommend the night tour of Alcatraz. It was awesome! Make sure to bring a warm jacket and if you go on the earlier of the 2 tours (6:20), you are allowed to stay later and take the last ferry back, giving you more time to take in the \"extras\" that are offered with only the night tours.
