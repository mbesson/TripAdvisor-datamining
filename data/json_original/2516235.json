There was a little cafe, even closer in a converted train car, that served exceptional lunches. The suites on the west side of the pool had been renovated and were OK inside.

But that also has advantages, because windows open and everything is handy. There are good lamps and the right amount of furniture. I like comfort and function above the ultra frou frou look. The kitchen is really useable also, but if one were staying longer, it might be nice to bring a blender or toaster. There are so many good restaurants, who wants to cook full meals? However, the ground floor rooms look out on a very nice patio area with picnic tables and grills. Many people barbeque here. They also have handy bike racks, but you have to bring your own bike. They can be rented on the main street. This is another great thing about the spa, it is one block from the main street of Calistoga and from a lovely bike path. The service could be better. I asked for late check-out of 12:00 and I called at 8:30 a.m. The desk person said all the late checkouts had been given out. ???? Calling the night before they say to call in the a.m. I noticed a huge number of people leaving early, so it seemed to me they are not being accommodating. Furthermore, the check in time is at 3 p.m. I wish we could get a law passed that specifies a hotel, spa or motel must give a customer 24 hours of time. As it stands, the check-in is at 3 and the check out is at 11:00. We went at the height of the season so expected to pay a good price, but this spa keeps raising their rates, so that it was really approaching $200 per night for 2 of us and a 12 year old. They have 3 pools and a large very hot pool that I never use. I like a pool around 90 degrees and only the kiddy pool is this temperature. Pools are 104, 100, and 80 respectively. The 80 degree pool is very comfortable when it is really hot, which it was in the afternoon. But for me in the a.m. and p.m. when the temperature outside dropped to maybe 60, the 80 degree pool is too cold. But the 100 degree pool is too hot to swim..

My husband burned his foot in the steam room and when he mentioned it to staff, they said \"Yeah, that's happened to a couple of people\". Well, if that's happened to more than one person, they should fix it, no? Dr. Wilkenson's across the street has a similar mud bath treatment and a much much better massage. The pools were very enjoyable but at times kind of crowded. Room service is marginal. They just do your bed and change the towels. They did not do our dishes (the few that there were) nor did they really clean the shower. The day we were leaving there was no hot water (although we did get a small discount for this). I think the best thing about this place are the pools and the fact that they are kid friendly.

Speaking of which, I though the rooms would be around $150 a night but because it was a holiday week (a few days before and New Year's eve), it turned out to be much more expensive. They really should advertise holiday prices on their website so that people know what they are going to pay. The total bill was a bit of a surprise and left a bad taste in my mouth.

People need to realize that what they call a \"spa\" - the scented everything, the soft lighting, the expensve \"custom\" products... those are just add-ons to the basics - mineral water, massage, mudbath... That's what you'll find here. Mineral water - three pools' worth (and a baby pool) - massage (very good ones), and mudbaths (don't come to Calistoga and not have a mudbath!). Staying here, you have all day access to all the pools, so you can nap and soak and nap and soak. Very nice. Rooms are pretty basic, but have TV and internet. Could use a few more pillows, and mattresses are pretty unspectacular - quite firm. Since the rooms are kitchenettes, you can also make your own breakfast and lunch and whatever and save a bundle. I've been coming to Calistoga and staying here a couple times a year for probably 20 years or more. I always schedule at least one mudbath and a massage. I have learned the best time is during the week, check in on a Monday and check out on a Thursday or Friday. Look around on a crowded weekend and you'll see every \"rule\" being violated, from \"no cell phones in pool area\" to \"no children under 14 in the hot pool\" to \"barbecues for hotel guests only\". So if you're coming to relax, don't come on a weekend. Too many doting parents ignoring their kids' obnoxious behaviors; people up late and having wine-soaked, maudlin discussions on the patios that waft into your open windows. During the week, esp. off season, it's mellow. After the public hours end (around 9p, I think), it's wonderful to go take some wine down to the pools and look at the stars. There's a great grocery across the street, and plenty of good restaurants on the main drag or nearby. Lots of Russians and other eastern europeans around during the week - which can be interesting, they're usually pretty nice and fun to talk with. Again, it's nothing fancy, offers the basics, a nice staff... you can visit day spas in town for more upscale products and atmosphere, but I think you're missing what Calistoga - beautiful, down-to-earth, funky, time-warped Calistoga - is all about.

I wanted to book an extra night after arriving and they were completely full so it didn't work but the staff were so unfriendly (if not almost hostile) or at the very least completely disinterested in helping me or offering suggestions for other lodging.

It is nice and quaint. Our tradition is Mother's Day and the plan for the day is the ladies have spa treatments and the guys and teens hang around the poolside. There are alot of families with small and teenagers. They bring coolers and own food or you can walk to the deli to get really good sandwiches etc but it's pricey. It's first come so groups do arrive about 1 hour prior to opening because they have a limit (maybe 50 dayuse). We have had the mudbath and mineral bath both with 1 hr massages. I like the mudbaths and didn't care for mineral baths (not a soaking bath type). All were nice and clean. Be prepared to go all natural. The attendants are kind and attentive. You don't want to wear a bathing suite in the mud baths-believe me it is more of a mess. The mud bath is warm/hot and soothing like a big scrub bath. Don't stress over it being clean. They clean it and wouldn't want anyone getting sick-it;s their business. I was happy 2 of the 3 past massages.. I guess you should make it clear with your theapist what type of massage you like. The prices are fair but to be able to have the rest of the family use the dayuse pools this is the trade off. Most of the resorts/facilities in town that have mineral pools (not all do) do not allow day use only. Each person has to have a spa treatment and or stay overnight in hotel. One thing is they stress or push the gratuity issue, towel attendant, mud bath, mineral bath everyone.I realize it is an added bonus but you already are paying a fair amount.

I agree generally with the reviews I see here, but I rate the place higher than most reviewers. Here's why: Yes, it lacks the glitzyness normally associated with Napa Valley lodgings. The decor, while not offensive, is nothing special. But I think that's the charm of the place--it's friendly and homey, not pretentious and snooty. Our room was very clean, with a nice kitchenette and a great, large shower in the bathroom (two shower heads). The rooms face the inner courtyard which is pocked with little alcoves containing picnic tables and barbecues. The combination of kitchenette inside and pools and barbecue outside provides a family-friendly oasis in the Napa Valley. Unlike other NV lodgings, you could stay here and save a lot on food by preparing many meals yourself. Many restaurants and a grocery store are steps away. Pools were great in the evening. All employees we encountered were friendly. One quirk: Even though it was chilly outside, the room got quite hot, and we had to run the air conditioner. No problem, really, but we felt funny running the A/C in the winter.
