Having read some of the previous reports I was a little concerned. However all we wanted was somewhere fairly reasonably priced close to the airport. We arrived at the hotel at 8am. Although check-in isn't until 2pm we were given our room by 9am. When we entered the room we thought there was some mistake. Seems we were upgraded to an 'Executive Suite' - not bad for \u00a360 a night.! We had a dining room/lounge and seperate bedroom with seating area and two bathrooms. It was a pity we weren't staying longer to make the most of it. The room was very clean. We were on the corner of the main Al Rigga Road and although you could hear some noise, it didn't keep us awake. We also didn't hear any aircraft noice apart from the odd helicopter. Coming from the middle of the countryside and not used to any noise, we didn't take bad with this at all. Breakfast was plentiful and tasted good. We only ate their one morning as we had booked into the Burj Al Arab for breakfast as a treat on the 2nd day - which cost more than our two night stay at this hotel! We met friends who were staying down on Jumeriah Beach and their hotel was lovely, very plush, although they paid the price for it. I think this was a great hotel for business and a short stopover in Dubai.

Ater a 15 minute wait while they made up the spare bed for our daughter the room was finally ready. Our booking did state that it was to be a triple room. On getting into to our room we found the only way to flush the toilet was we had to take the lid off the cistern and flush it this way. On waking the next morning we discovered there were only two towels for three of us. After 2 phone calls and a visit to the front desk we finally got an extra towel. But the saga does not end there. Every time they changed our dirty towels they only left us two. After 3 frustrating days they finally got it right the day before we left. We called and reported the toilet not working properly to the front desk and man arrived to fix it just as we left to go out. On arriving back we discovered the toilet still not work properly. I finally fixed the toilet myself. The hand rail in the shower was loose and the handle used to release the plug in the hand basin fell apart every time you used it. To us the bathroom seemed if it had been made with cheap products and showdy workmanship. On a positive side the room was clean and the staff in the Restaurants and at the breakfast buffet were very friendly. We did fill out the customer survey before leaving and made our feelings about the hotel room felt.

It's our first time in this part of the Persian Gulf. The free shuttle pickup at the airport was not there when we arrived so I had to call the hotel who sent one immediately. First impression of Hawthorn Deira was so-so, even thought of transfering if we found something better. The room was not yet ready but the front desk was nice enough to upgrade us to a junior suite. There was subway construction going on outside the hotel so it was not a pretty sight. Our junior suite on the 6th floor was spacious, clean, nice and very comfortable. There was a sitting area. The bathroom was modern and done in ceramic tiles throughout. There were plenty of cabinets. There was a big desk and the free internet provided was great. The window opened to the next building which was not a nice view but we didn't mind. The hallways are bright, nicely decorated, and clean. We slept right away as we were jetlagged. We took the Dubai Creek Dinner Cruise that evening and it was a great start to our fun vacation. The morning breakfasts were included and it was good with the usual stuff and an omellete bar. Breakfast menu was the same everyday. By the 2nd day, we tossed the idea of moving to another hotel because we found out that our hotel was really very good after all. The location is central and very accessible. There are plenty of restaurants and shopping a few blocks away. Once the subway construction gets done in the future, Al Rigga Road in front of the hotel, is a nice road to walk. We felt safe. The Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank is across the street from the hotel and I use the ATM there everyday. Everything in Dubai is expensive, forget being tax free, everything is not cheap. Hotel, shopping, gold, food, restaurants, tours, etc., prepare to pay more. Taxi is the only reasonable thing in Dubai. Aside from 22K gold jewelry, they have a lot of beautiful jewelry designs in diamonds & gemstones you'll find in the malls mostly. The gold souk had more gold jewelry. Again, not cheap. Unfortunately, Dubai prides itself on its tall buildings & malls but forget to emphasize the importance of their culture, heritage and history. Coming from the States, who wants to see another mall or tall building? They have the Dubai Museum but I felt that they should do more with this than anything else if they want to attract tourism. I can't believe that part of their city tour includes the malls. Duh! They have big malls but only a few worth visiting because they are different. They are Wafi Mall, Souk Madinat Jumeirah, Ibn Battuta Mall, and the Mall of the Emirates. You'll find the indoor skiing at the Mall of the Emirates. It was interesting but I imagined it to be bigger. We paid $145 for a buffet dinner just so we can enter the famed so-called 7-star Burj Al Arab Hotel in Jumeirah. It is not open to the public unless you are staying or dining there. It is all hype. The hotel is overrated. It is not all that. The lobby was not impressive and it was small. The hotels in Las Vegas are far better. The buffet was not even gourmet. Of course, we didn't see the rooms but I have a coffee table book of this hotel where they show the different rooms. The decor is too garish, loud & outdated for my taste. Oh well, we just had to find out for ourselves. So my advice, save your money. The Wild Wadi Water Park was very nice. Riding all-terrain vehicles in the sand was a lot of fun. The highlight of our trip was the trip to Abu Dhabi and the Desert Safari. Abu Dhabi is nicer than Dubai without the traffic problem. It is 77 miles southwest of Dubai and an easy ride passing thru Sheikh Zayed Road where all the tall buildings are being constructed in a row, catching a glimpse of the soon-to-be tallest building in the world, the Burj Dubai and stopping by at Marina City. Ooops, I think I just gave you my entire take on Dubai beyond Hawthorn Deira. I'm glad we came here, we learned a lot. It was a very good vacation and one we'll treasure.", "Date": "April 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dorset, England", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Stopover Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Annabel-Lee", "ReviewID": "UR6550337", "Content": "Stayed here for a two night stopover en route from Australia to UK, arriving at 3 am in late December.
