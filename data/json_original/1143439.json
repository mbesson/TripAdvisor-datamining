{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Beware BEDBUGS! I saw it in a travel book. 5 minutes from the airport - it sounded perfect for a quick sleep and shower after a late flight into Honolulu airport and before catching an early plane in the morning to Maui.The rooms are more like closets - there are no real doors, nor do the walls reach the ceiling. In the morning, i realized i had bites on my feet. By the evening, the bites had spread all over my body. Bed bug bites create intense itching and welts that don't go away for over a week. scars remain longer.Apparently only 50% of people react to the bites. My friend didn't, but i did.Not a great way to start a vacation!

Shower Tree Mini-Hotel is not really hotel. It is more like a flop house for $35 to $45 per night. Don't get me wrong ... If all you need is a bed and shower for one person this place will work. This hotel is only 3/4 mile from the airport in Honolulu and on the main bus route. The rooms are approximately 6 x 10 and have plywood walls. There is a twin bed tucked into an alcove in the wall and a night stand in each room. The rooms are clean. The bed was comfortable. They have a day room with a television. There is absolutely no tolerance for eating in the rooms or talking on your cell phone inside. The rules are strictly enforced. Bring a padlock with you if you plan on leaving the room to go elsewhere since there are no locks on the outside of the rooms. There is a hook-and-eye lock on the inside to lock yourself in the room.", "Date": "Aug 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR667086764", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "David_in_Cottonwood"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60982-d1143439-r23142929-Nimitz_Shower_Tree_Mini_Hotel-Honolulu_Oahu_Hawaii.html", "HotelID": "1143439", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
