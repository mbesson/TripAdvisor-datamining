Key turn-off was the cleanliness of the room: hair on the (dirty) rug, stains on the bed sheets, yellowish curtains...YUK. Staff was rather rude and un-helping, answering \"NO\" before even getting the questions right... Frankly speaking, this is not a nice business stay for the money. There are better (and cleaner!) options on Nathan Road.

Cheap compared to other hotels of the same \"quality range\". It's about 5-10 mins walk to the MTR station. For the price I was expecting a hostel-type of accommodation but I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the reception area and especially the room. It had a bathtub! The only bad thing was the bed. It was clean, but not comfortable. It was not soft and the pillows were kinda flat. My semi-double bed at the apartment felt bigger and more comfortable for the both of us. If the bed was more comfortable I would book here again in a heartbeat with my family, but I think I'll check out other hotels first. The receptionists and other people in the lobby were very very accommodating and most spoke great English.

The hotel is located in the north side of Kowloon, just south of Boundary Street. It is about a 5 minute walk to the Prince Edward MTR station. From there, you can go anywhere in HK or Kowloon. It is also close to Nathan Road which has tons of restaurants and shopping. Also within 5 minutes is the Fa Yuen Street market where you can pick up clothing, toys, accessories, and jewelry at low prices. Bargin if you can! Check-in and check-out were efficient. The staff are friendly, helpful, and speak English. Our room had 2 twin beds (hard by my standards, but OK). Rooms are small and there is not much room to walk around , but it had a TV, lounge chair and a bay window seat which was convenient to store 3 suitcases while still enjoying the view. The bathroom is basic and tiny and can only fit one person at a time. It smelled a bit musty, but it was clean. The soap dispenser in the shower did not work well and no shampoo bottles were in the bathroom. Towels are on the thin side, but overall - the room and bathroom worked for us and our stay was comfortable. There is a restaurant in the hotel, but we did not eat there. You also have to pay for internet use.

Location is EXCELLENT !! 5-7 min to MTR station. Restaurants nearby. Yes, it is in the middle of the road, but as mentioned before, it is conviently located and noise was NOT an issue. Room was nice, looks more like a \"hotel\" then a \"motel\", no \"run-down\" feeling at all though is \"3 star\". We only hope that the room is a little bit bigger, ours has a double (queen) bed, which we learned, next time, get a 2 separate beds bedroom to have more space to lay things out and move around.

I stayed at the Newton Kowloon four times in August-September, 2004. The hotel is located in the north of Mong Kok, close to the Prince Edward MTR station. This is definitely not a touristy area, but the nearby MTR station, 7-Elevens and dry cleaners covered all my bases. The hotel is somewhat old but very clean. The rates offered excellent value. Certain areas, such as the coffee shop, were being renovated toward the end of our stay so I cannot comment on them. The rooms were small but included the essentials: mini-fridge, a desk, in-room safe and coffee maker. The mirrors in the bathrooms are heated, which is great to get rid of the steam on them from the bath/shower. There was TV, but with no cable connection there were only three English-language TV stations and a handful of Cantonese and Mandarin stations. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. The front desk arranged safe-keeping of bags between stays and provided advice on nearby amenities (such as the cleaners). We had a view of the nearby soccer field and some mountains off in the distance each stay. I appreciated the view given the rather cramped quarters in most of the city. Overall, the Newton Hotel Kowloon is a great hotel for budget-conscious travellers.", "Date": "February 6, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Newton Hotel Kowloon", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d505682-Reviews-Newton_Hotel_Kowloon-Hong_Kong.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">No.66 Boundary Street, Mongkok, Kowloon</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Hong Kong</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">China</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "505682", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/1c/05/1c0591d87b9adefadb67f33efc8e14c31large.jpg"}}
