This hotel, as other reviewers have said, is a short walk to Circular Quay and Darling Harbour and a few strides to Wynyard Station, so the location is perfect. Add to that the fact that the price was almost half that of the other hotels in similar proximity and you really have a winning combination. But a well located cheap hotel doesn't always make for an enjoyable stay. However I'm pleased to report that the Travelodge Wynyard does not let you down on the other aspects either. The staff were all friendly and helpful, the rooms spacious and clean, a good sized bathroom with a fantastic shower, and, probably most importantly, a comfortable bed. Worth pointing out that my room was on a high floor (so high in fact that the lift didn't go all the way up there!) so I got none of the reported noise. We got 25% off the breakfast buffet bringing it down to $20. This is still quite expensive, but then you have to remember that you're in a hotel in major city and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the price you'd pay most places. In actual fact we enjoyed the breakfast - fruit, cereals, pancakes, juices, bacon etc. The coffee was quite good too. Sometimes it's worth paying an extra few $$ for the convenience of not having to go out for breakfast. Only one thing was a bit annoying. We booked on a Tuesday to take advantage of their Chooseday offers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the 2 for 1 breakfast being our target. When we came to claim it we were told that we were not eligible as we had booked using their Advance Purchase 30 rate. I've checked again on the website and can see nowhere where this is stated to be excluded. For this reason I mark the hotel down a point - I don't like to feel cheated.

Don't use the hotel internet, the McDonalds around the corner has free internet.

I didn't want to pay a fortune considering my arrival was 10pm and really only needed a bed, shower & breakfast and moving on the next morning. The train from airport is ideal as the Wynyard stop is right near the hotel so literally about 2 mins safe walk from the station. I booked through the hotels website and paid on arrival. However the desk clerk charged me the wrong amount, three dollars less and I told him. He immediately reversed the transaction and then charged me the correct amount. Unfortunately I had 2 transactions off my credit card which both came off immediately. I don't know why but the reversal did not show up straight away. It took 3 days which was really annoying as I had paid twice for the room. I called my bank and they said the transaction was pending. I should have said nothing and let him charge me the $3 less. A few hours after checking out and talking to my bank I went back to the hotel to discuss with them. The manager told me he'd look into it and call me. I never received a call from him. So if you stay here I suggest you take care with checking in transactions to prevent it happening to you. All of this aside the room was quite high up and the morning traffic noise was loud but not unbearable. I was wanting a fairly early morning anyway so wasn't bothered. There was a musty smell in the room from the air conditioning. It went away when a/c was turned off. Didn't matter to me for the short stay of only a few hours. The bathroom was small but modern & clean. The room was fairly modern, clean & well kept. Looked very much like what is on the hotels website. The wooden shutters were a bit stiff to work but we got there. I did hear the water running in shower & toilet in room next door. But it wasn't loud enough to be a disturbance. The breakfast in the morning was quite nice. The buffet not much different from other hotels but the coffee was great. For the $167 I paid which included breakfast I feel this is a place worth returning to. The location alone being in between the centre of city & circular quay with Darling harbour a 20 minute walk away, and close to train station makes it very handy. I've been to Sydney many times and mostly stayed the first night at the Menzies which is opposite the Travelodge. But the last few times I've stayed there its been very disappointing and at least $50 more per night than this hotel and not including breakfast. I would definitely stay here again.

Check in was chaotic and slow, with the small lobby overcrowded and harassed-looking staff unable to cope with the numbers of guests. When I was eventually served it was reasonably efficient, but the wait was far too long. My room on the 21st floor was clean and tidy, but generally quite cheaply furnished. There were a few modernisations to what is clearly a much older room. The bathroom was absolutely tiny - more of what you'd expect in Japan than Australia. The shower was in a tub with a high step, which may be an issue for older or less mobile guests. A couple of points rankled a bit; Firstly, the penny-pinching is obvious. There was one small cake of soap, a tiny shampoo and a tiny conditioner, all low quality. There was no free bottle of water. The TV was old and small, the newspapers in the lobby were not free. All minor things, but not what you are looking for in a hotel at this price bracket. Equally annoying was the obvious push to on-sell. At check in I was pushed to buy dinner and breakfast in the hotel, and this continued in the room. I've never seen a place that advertises its breakfast buffer with signage IN THE SHOWER before, but there you have it. Innovative or just plain intrusive? I'll let you be the judge. There were also maintenance issues. Until I turned the air conditioner all the way down to '5 degrees', it pumped out hot air, turning the room into a sauna. At 5 degrees, it was practically Antarctic. This really impacted sleep quality (I opted to shiver under the blankets rather than to sweat in the heat) and was simply not good enough. Bed quality and room furnishing were cheap, but in reasonable condition and comfortable enough. The 'king bed' is too singles pushed together.

This hotel, in my opinion, is not 4 star, maybe 3 or 3.5 star. So check in, get to 18th floor, hallways are dark and univiting, its like an old office building has be divided up into rooms, generally a very tired looking interior, get into room and generally it was OK, but for the money and other positive reviews is a bit rich. The bed linen was tatty and scuff marks visible, the bed was on big wheels and couldnt be locked in place to prevent bed from moving (even when sitting on it), the bathroom was not exactly the most clean, soap scum on black tray which the complimentary soap etc sits on, mould in tile grouts, the television reception was terrible, and a very old tired looking air conditioning system, and a window which could not be close fully as it was missing a screw to the fixture of the handle. Even the view from the 18th level is overlooking noisy air con units on the neighbouring buildings roof. Also, I notice in previous reviews that the walls did not block out all noise from other rooms - this is definately the case. Staff on front counter are nice enough but could crack a smile once in a while and could be more forthcoming in friendly conversation. The front entrance is where the designated smoking area is, so its a lovely thing to walk outside and first thing you are hit with is a waft of cigarette smoke. There is no where to pull up out the front if you are driving and need to drop someone off.

When we got to our room we had two singe beds with a small bedsite table in the midlle.( We have asked for a double bed when we booked) When we rang reception to ask why this hasn't been obliged we were told that because we booked over the internet and not directly through Travelodge website our request doesn't need to be acknowledged and that the hotel is full so there is no way we can change a room. I understand that you don't alway get all you requested especially if they are fully booked but there is a way to tell people!!!! The room was at the end o the corridor and was very small with tiny bathroom. New deco and refurbishment much needed. When we put the two single beds together we discoverd large amount of dust and the room clearly hasn't been hoovered properly. Bed was comfy but didn't feel or look very clean. Towels in the bathroom were very rough and definitely needed changing for new ones. Shower wasn't working properly and we had to hold the shower head (which was attached to the wall) as it wouldn't stay in place) No wifi availalbe in the room unless you are staying on 12th floor or higher (we were on 5th floor).

The room we got smelled damp, coming from the air conditioning unit that is located at waist height below the windows. It really is an unpleasant smell and filled the room. However when opening the window the noise from the busy street is loud. We had to change room as the smell was making me feel ill...the room we had faced Margaret Street, and we were moved to one that faced York Street - this was a massive improvement and we were happy enough there for our 4 night stay. The location is great, we walked everywhere...5-10 mins easy walk to Sydney harbour and Opera House and the area feels safe to walk around at night. On our return to Travelodge Wynyard (for our one night stay) we were booked into another room facing Margaret Street, which again, stunk! We moved again to one facing York Street which was fine! Try to ensure you get one facing York St and you should be fine! Although relatively expensive for a Travelodge everything is pricey in this area - must be because it seems safe, and central. It is definitely worth the money, especially because you don't have to rely on any public transport or taxis at all. We ate in the restaurant for 2 nights, they have different themed deals on each night e.g. steak night, pasta etc. The food was nice and good value. It is really close to the train station so you can walk with your bags - it's literally 1.5 blocks. We used the train to get to/from Sydney airport and it was great, well worth doing. We used the internet computers in the lobby quite a few times. It's about $2 for 20 mins...and some of the computers are very slow and crash.

I have to say that I have never stayed anywhere but a 5 star in the City, but i decided to stay here for the location. I'm glad i did. Location was brilliant - goes without saying, and close to my beloved Rocks area. The counter service and check in was fantastic.

I advised i could sit on the lounge and wait if need be until after lunch, but he checked me right in. I was VERY grateful as i was feeling quite faint after my solo flight to Sydney. He was a young Indian male, who was very pleasant throughout my 3 day stay there (unfortunately, I forget his name). The room was just what i needed - clean, quiet, warm, a comfy bed. This establishment may not have the bells and whistles of some 5 star hotels nearby, but it was perfect for my purposes. I stayed at the Swissotel a few months ago, and absolutely hated it. The worst experience i have ever had staying at a hotel. This place, being a 4 star, trumps it! The only slightly negative comment i would make would be the very limited late night room service menu. When i called to place an order, i was told i had missed the chef by 4 minutes (!), but that pizza could be arranged. Apart from that issue, i have nothing but praise. The breakfast downstairs was great. I had a craving for scrambled eggs, and it was perfect. If i hadn't been too embarrassed to do so, i would have gone back for seconds and thirds, i loved it that much (currently pregnant with twins and was craving eggs that morning)! My partner joined me on the second day. His only complaint was the car park space was somewhat cramped, and it was difficult driving out. But overall, i really enjoyed my experience here.

Although I do stay in a number of hotels around the place so I have a fair idea what is good value and what is not. I have stayed at this property 5 times over the last 12 months on business mostly 3 - 4 nights at a time and have just booked again for next week. Check in is usually busy when I get there. I have to wait most times but not for long as the check in counter is one of the most efficient I have seen at a Sydney hotel. Lifts are reasonable fast and never too crowded. I have never had to wait long and they don't take long to get even to the 20th floor. (Tip if you room service dinner - They put the daily specials on a sheet in the lift and you can order it through room service. I always check it out) Rooms are not huge but they are very well laid out and to me that is more important than a heap of space I will not need. I have only ever stayed in a standard room which has a Queen bed (very comfortable and not the zip together type), two tub chairs and a desk with chair, LCD TV (decent size too) and good lighting. The bathrooms are compact with shower over tub, basin and toilet all neatly packed in but still very usable. I'm a big guy and I have no trouble using the facilities. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never had any trouble with water pressure or temperature. Room Service has a good menu (along with the specials in the lift) and very prompt service. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never waited longer than half an hour for a meal. Only downside is no Breakfast Room Service. Restaurant is always clean and tidy. They are open early for breakfast and always have customers at night which is a good sign that the food is good. I mainly do room service dinner but the times that i have had dinner there I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fault the service or the food. At breakfast time there is a good selection of all the regular Buffet or Continental style items. Gym, they have one and they have equipment in it that I have seen people using. Looks like modern equipment. I should be able to tell you more but I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t used it. Checkout, See Check in. Same same. Location, Perhaps the best feature of this hotel is the location, about 1 minute slow walk to Wynyard station. (barely get wet in the rain) Major Supermarkets very close by, perhaps 2 minutes. Good Coffee shops and Restaurants in the immediate area. I have also noticed that even though you are in the city it is pretty quite outside between 10pm and 6am so i always get a good night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep. I have stayed here on holiday too and its a great location for everything the city has to offer. The Rocks, Circular Quay, Opera House and downtown shopping are all easy walking distance.

This review though is about 2 very different rooms. My friend and I had a very nice twin room overlooking York Street. Although not exceptionally large, it was light bright and very clean. All we needed. We did not see our Scottish friend's room until the second night and were frankly a little shocked.It was on the opposite side of the hotel and very dark. That we could have lived with, but the room stank of cigarette smoke (the hotel is supposed to be non smoking) even the bed linen smelled of smoke and there was what looked like a burn mark on one of the quilts and a stain on the other.All in all it looked very grubby. The room had an interconnecting door and the queen bed was 2 beds joined together. Not unusual I know but this had 2 seperate quilts on it so it didn't look like 1 bed, just 2 pushed together. We opened the window to try and get rid of the smell. The next day I spoke to the reception staff who said they would look into it and inform the duty manager,but nothing happened and my friend didn't want to complain further as she doesn't like to make a fuss. It was disappointing, though, as the rooms were poles apart and no one attempted to speak to us about it again. So would I recommend the Travel lodge?

Booked direct with Travelodge.com.au on a Tuesday and got a special rate of A4144 per night excluding breakfast. Compared to other hotels in the CBD this was a bargain. We caught the train from the international airport and arrived at the Wynyard Station within 25 minutes. The hotel is only a couple of hundred metres from the station exit which is extremely convenient when using public transport with luggage. Found the reception staff to be extremely friendly and helpful. I had booked a standard room at the cheapest rate and found we had been upgraded to a suite. Yay! Our room was on the second floor facing York St so it wasn't particularly quiet (I always travel with earplugs so the street noise didn't bother me). We had a queen size bed, a sofabed, kitchenette with mircrowave, fridge, sink and dining table and the room was much larger than the standard rooms. It would have been more than adequate if our family of four were staying here. Bathroom amenities were minimal (I'm a sucker for all those little bottles :-)) but it was clean and functional. Airconditioning was a little touchy but did the job adequately. We used the internet in the annex off the foyer which cost $2 for 15 minutes. There were loungers in here also for meeting with friends and a concierge during the day who was happy to advise on restaurants, shopping, transport etc. We ate breakfast at the hotel restaurant which was pricey for what was offered (but I knew that from previous reviews) but it suited us and it was more than adequate. The location was fantastic! We walked to the Rocks, Darling Harbour and Pitt St mall in minutes and when we needed to catch a bus to the Northern Beaches, the bus stop was across the street. Unless you must have the 5* service and facilities (and wish to pay for it) I would recommend this hotel and will definately stay here again. ** We also stayed at the Old Sydney Holiday Inn for 1 night at the end of our trip and I have posted a review.", "Date": "April 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.A.", "Title": "\u201cCentral location in middle of Sydney city; convenient walking to major sights; access to extensive public transport\u201d", "Author": "Chelydra", "ReviewID": "UR61381817", "Content": "Stay at this hotel for its central location in the middle of the city of Sydney, convenient walking to major sights and facilities, and access to extensive public transport taking you to other places of interest. Do not expect any sort of memorable view from your room, as the hotel is surrounded by other high-rise buildings. If you intend using public transport extensively for sightseeing, before you leave Sydney airport find out details about the various types and durations of TravelPass. We found the information counter at the end of the arrivals concourse often had a long queue. If you go downstairs where you buy train tickets, you can also obtain information from posters and from the ticket sellers. We found our TravelPass very useful, as it gave us unlimited access to regular trains, buses and ferries which covered everywhere that we wanted to go and saved us money in the process. Note that travelling to and from the airport terminals involved special fares (expensive given the short distances). Once you arrive at Wynyard underground station and pass through the exit from the platforms, leave by the escalators leading up to York St. At the top entrance, you will see a park facing you. Turn left and walk to Margaret Street. Cross over and continue about 50 feet. The Travelodge entrance will be to your left. About 10 feet to the right of the steps leading up to the reception counter you can find a recessed ramp for wheeling up your bags instead of having to lug them up the stairs. To the right of reception is the hotel restaurant and to the left a lounge area with computers providing Internet access. The lifts-elevators are to the left of reception and opposite the lounge area. Reception staff were polite and cooperative; social skills varied with the individual we encountered. Robert was especially pleasant, and Manuel of maintenance was responsive to our need for the replacement of a defective bedside lamp. Housekeeping on the 7th floor provided us with sugar when we ran out prematurely. When we stayed, use of Internet access using computers in the lounge area was $2 per 15 minutes. Use of an Internet connection in a room was $11 per hour, $22 per 24 hours, and $66 per week. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind a 10- to 15-minute walk, you can obtain free Internet access for 20-minute periods in the basement level of the Macquarie Street wing of the New South Wales State Public Library. Leave bags and accessories in free electronically operated lockers just outside the basement entrance. We found library staff pleasant, helpful and cooperative. The hotel has 22 stories. Each floor with accommodation has about 15 rooms with lifts at one end and the room numbers starting and finishing at this end. Quieter rooms are at the end of the corridor away from the lifts-elevators. Up to the 16th or 18th stories (depending on the room location along the corridor), the back rooms face a blank wall or the windows of an office building about 20-30 feet away. To have a view of sorts (mainly of other high-rise buildings), you will need a room facing York Street. At the time of our stay a desk clerk told us that rooms above the 12th floor cost more. On the 21st floor you can find a gym, shower and laundry room with two washers and two dryers (each $2 per load). Of acceptable size and with a table and two chairs plus a sofa, our room was adequate for sleeping and showering, and for leaving our luggage while we went out sightseeing. It also had a bar refrigerator with a small ice cube tray (the hotel did not have a public ice machine available), and tea- and coffee-making facilities. Beds were comfortable and the closet contained two extra pillows. There was good closet space with 12 hangers, a room safe and a bureau with two deep drawers. The air conditioning worked well, and you could darken the room during daytime if required. Phone calls from the room had an 80-cent connection fee added, including those considered toll free. One item of printed information in the room that we would have found useful would have been a list of all the services and facilities offered by the hotel and in its immediate vicinity. The windows had single glazing, so the noise of traffic and sirens clearly entered the room; however, it did not bother us particularly. Soundproofing between rooms was adequate \u00e2\u20ac\u201d only if other occupants restrained themselves, and did not yell conversations or bang furniture doors and drawers. We could hear the flow of water occurring in the shower of the adjoining rooms, but it was not particularly bothersome. We could hear voices from other guests in the corridor, as the door frames did not have a seal or buffers to dampen noise from doors banging or others talking. We had a problem with nighttime party-goers, but this was our bad luck. When the rowdy occupants of the next room turned up at 2:30 a.m. from a night out on the town, someone from staff at reception came up in person immediately and told them in no uncertain terms to quieten down or the hotel would evict them. Hooray! They and their cronies were not the only guests on the floor. In the middle of the small park between York Street and Carrington Street, you can see a dome. Under it is a Sydney bus office Transit Shop which has racks with bus timetables and routes. Ask at the inquiry window for free comprehensive network maps \u00e2\u20ac\u201d of which there are four \u00e2\u20ac\u201d one each for the northern, southern, eastern and western regions. We found them useful for getting to places not served by the train system. There is a small Coles supermarket at Wynyard and another at 388 George Street \u00e2\u20ac\u201d both listed as open till midnight every day, except Saturday (then till 10 p.m.). We used the Woolworth supermarket at the corner of Park and George streets across the road from Town Hall, also open till midnight most nights. If possible, avoid buying from small convenience stores. As almost everywhere, you will pay a lot extra for whatever you buy there. A good place to eat in Chinatown is in an inconspicuous food court at the top-left of Dixon street (lined with restaurants and touts). It has numerous counters with a range of vendors serving various Asian cuisines, freshly cooked at very reasonable prices. You can eat there for several days and always have something quite different.

On arrival at around 10am, we'd just undergone a long 9 hour overnight bus ride and couldn't wait to shower and sleep.. we were made to wait about 10 minutes at reception - which is a long time standing there while the staff were avoiding eye contact and flicking through files. Finally, when the receptionist did acknowledge us she simply told us the room will not be ready until 12pm. I commented that we'd been on an overnight bus ride and would like a shower, she suggested using the upstairs gym shower, and there should be towels up there - if not, we should go and FIND housekeeping OURSELVES for more towels!!! Skipped the shower, headed into the city to watch a movie and pass time - we got back at around 1pm, and were informed our room was STILL not ready and wouldn't be until at least 2pm - they did NOT offer any sort of complimentary tea, coffee or anything. Room ended up not being ready until 3pm, and not once did anyone apologise. The room was NOT 4-star quality.. it'd be lucky to be 3-stars. Tiny bathroom, no fan, tiny room, no microwave, no bowls, glasses or cutlery and little storage space - basically just a bed and TV. Rip off. We requested some bowls so we could eat our own breakfast in the room rather than spend $25 each a day on their breakfast - the rude receptionist informed us it would be a $5 charge for them just to BRING up the bowls. I said that was ridiculous, and he said I can get them myself then - RUDE and NOT 4-star service!! Adding onto that with the restaurant - extremely expensive - around $25-$35 for basic burgers, pasta and steaks. They did not replenish tea or coffee either, and staff told us if we wanted more, we had to find housekeeping ourselves for more. Internet access is a RIP OFF.. and very slow. To top it all off - on ordering more towels from a receptionist who barely spoke or understood English, they did not arrive after 20 minutes, so I called back, got another receptionist and they were up within 10 minutes.. still a long time to wait for towels. Staff were the rudest I've ever encountered and did not even farewell us nicely or thank us for our business.

I completely agree with another reviewer that this place should not be viewed as somewhere to stay-in for cozy evenings but as a handy and well-equipped base for making the most of visiting Sydney. If you want lazy days by a pool or long/fancy indoor dining, go elsewhere. The room was clean and had everything we required for a nice one week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stay: refrigerator, hair dryer, a pitcher that made hot water for coffee and tea, in-room safe, comfortable bed and a nicely functioning AC. We could easily walk to the Quay area, Opera House, Darling Harbour, anywhere within the CBD, and The Rocks. The Wynyard Train Station was within a stone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s throw of the property. It was a slightly longer but definitely doable walk to Chinatown, North Sydney, and Paddington.

Having been in a Travelodge (Melbourne) earlier in our tour I was pleasantly surprised to find the excellent experience we had there reflected at Sydney - for smart/practical accommodation in an ideal location handy for city sightseeing Travelodge are '2 for 2' ! ****** The only concern during my stay is potentially VERY serious. We experienced a long, block-wide (as I found out later) daytime power cut which halted EVERYTHING (incl lifts). Since I just happened to be back in my room at the time, I had to use the emergency stairs to go down the many floors (bells were ringing and I was not confident there was also a fire, perhaps causing the power-cut, so was keen to make an 'escape'), but was halted around floor 5 as the emergency lighting wasn't working at all on the stairs at that floor or below (so it was pitch black). WORSE STILL, the access door to that floor was LOCKED. I was able to to get to ground-level by going back up a floor, crossing-over and going down the other stairs but the ramifications of my experience are hopefully clear to all. I shudder to think what might have happened if there had been a fire during the night and a evacuation required. The manager on-call was rightfully concerned when I pointed out the problem, BUT I did not get the full confidence it was going to be investigated or rectified with any immediacy since the staff were more concerned about the on-going power-cut. I hope it was attended to and resolved soon after, but it shouldn't have been like that anyway..... ****** The hotel is a narrow high-rise located on the corner of a very busy street in the centre of the lively city of Sydney. The local area is dominated by corporate business, so the noise really centres on traffic which is mostly present during the day - if, like I was, you are in a higher room the intrusion of that noise is minimal at night. Since Sydney is a huge city you can never be located close to everything, but this Travelodge has the best compromise I think since an underground train station is barely 100yds away and the very attractive 'hub' of the massive ferry wharfs and Sydney Opera House/Harbour Bridge can be accessed by a 10 minute walk (or short train ride). There is a very well-stocked supermarket in the underground complex of the nearby train station, as well as several shops of various kinds at ground-level. The facilities and locale of this hotel mean it is really more like a motel, but that should not detract from the overall quality of what is there - it should not be viewed as somewhere to stay-in for cosy evenings but as a handy and well-equipped base for making the most of visiting Sydney. If you want lazy days by a pool or long/fancy indoor dining go elsewhere ! Having said that, the restaurant does evening meals and an extremely popular and good value lunch special (AU$14.50 incl a beer when I was there) on weekdays - ideal if you are returning in the middle of the day for a recharge before venturing out again. Overall, the hotel was fine with no significant negative points, with all the expected room facilities and cleanliness. There was an in-room safe, effective aircon and the bathroom had a bath (some hotel bathrooms don't !). Due to the surrounding high-rise buildings don't expect too much of a view from your room.... There are 3 lifts which, after 5 weeks on tour with several bad experiences, managed the distinction of all working properly and coping with demand - amazing ! The aforementioned dining area is at the front of the hotel on ground-level, looking out onto the road (so you can feel a bit like a zoo animal at feeding time); it is quite large and practical with the chefs accessible via the wide serving 'hatch' for thing such as eggs 'cooked-to-order' (something I like a lot) at breakfast, which was buffet-style with a reasonable choice of foodstuffs. I found the reception staff to be friendly and helpful and there were 2 quite well stocked information areas with leaflets for local attractions and tours as well as a small armchair area with TV 'waiting area' by reception. This is a smart, clean and tidy hotel for a stay in Sydney which offers a superb location for visiting the city. I have some serious reservations about the emergency facilities, but can only hope my experience was isolated and the problem resolved.", "Date": "May 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Woking, England", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "mumontour08", "ReviewID": "UR30909752", "Content": "This hotel is in an excellent location - very close to Wynyard Station, near Circular Quay, the Rocks, the bridge.

This was a standard sized room with a double bed, tea and coffee making suppies, a kettle and safe. The bonuses were an empty fridge (much more useful) and a TV which worked much better. The bathroom was done as a wet room with an excellent shower - my only grumble was that there was nowhere to put anything down apart from on the floor. I think this bathroom may have been intended for wheelchair access - anyway it was great. My room rate included continental breakfast for the first 4 days. The buffet was really nice - fresh fruit, lots of cereal, cheese, muffins, toast, drinks - and went well with the complimentary newspaper. I paid for breakfast one morning and it was $20. there was also hot food which looked appetising.

I was very impressed with their communications prior to my visit. My emails and questions were responded to within 24 hours and in a very customer friendly manner. My flight arrived at 6:30am and I was aware that official check in time would not be until 2pm which is typical of most hotels at which I've stayed. They did tell me that they expected the room to be ready by Noon if I wanted to check by with them at that time. They gave me a map and gave me a good orientation to things to see nearby and stored my luggage. I spent that morning looking around and then going to the Sydney Aquarium. and Wildlife Park...a must experience. The time passed quickly and I actually didn't get back to the hotel until almost 2 pm. If you buy a combined ticket to the Aquarium and Wildlife attractions, you get a discount and unlimited visits for 30 days. I did eat the full breakfast on my last day as it would be a very long 24 hours back home. It was excellent with a great selection. Whenever I went out in the morning for my activities, I glanced into the restaurant and found it very busy. I did eat two evening meals in it and they were quite good and reasonable with attentive table service. For those wanting just a light breakfast, Starbucks is just down the street on the corner. McDonalds is located on the next street over with more of a walk than to Starbucks. There is a Japanese restaurant next door and small cafes and delis within easy walking distance. I chose this hotel because I planned to be active and would just need a comfortable room to sleep and did not want to pay sky high exotic destination prices. My room was very clean and it was quiet. I have problems sleeping at times so any small noises can bother me. I heard very little during sleeping hours. The location is excellent as it is within walking distance of Darling Harbour, the Rocks, etc. It is also close to a train station. There is also the monorail, Explorer Bus and the Hop On, Hop Off bus for easy exploration when you get tired of walking. I even took a day tour to Canberra, the Australian captiol, which gave another insight into Australia and a contrast to Sydney but a wonderful city in its own right with its spectacular architecture, buildings, and national embassies. The staff was very good at alerting me to any messages left with activity companies, and they were very friendly. Some spent time in \"down\" moments discussing the local area as well as the states. Bottom line is that I have stayed in 4 star hotels with far less effective service and which were noisy. I absolutely was satisfied with my reception, my stay, accomodations, and assistance while there. If I return, I will definitely return to the Travelodge Wynyard.

The subway stops at both the international and domestic terminals of the airport. Take it to the Wynyard Station and exit on York Street. Look to your left; the hotel is on the very next block, about 100 meters away. (It took me, from the time my plane landed in Sydney to the time I arrived at the hotel, exactly one hour; that included the time during which I had to wait to get my bags as the carousel.) Rooms: My room was fairly large. The bed was comfortable, and there was a fair amount of storage space. I had a refrigerator but no microwave. The staff at the Travelodge is very courteous and more than willing to answer questions and provide assistance to patrons. Fun: The Travelodge is in the heart of Sydney. It is about a 10-minute walk from Circular Quay and Sydney Tower, and 20-25 minutes from the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Circular Quay where the Sydney Opera House is located; it is also where one can catch the harbor ferries. Food: There is a restaurant at the hotel. Breakfast runs $20 (Australian) for the continental buffet and $25 for the hot buffet. Dinner will cost about $17-25 per entr\u00c3\u00a9e. If you are on a tight budget or want to eat away from the hotel, there are numerous restaurants and bakeries nearby.

For those looking for a quick cup of coffee or snack, Starbuck\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is located across the street from the hotel. (Head toward Wynyard Station on York Street; you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss it.) Fitness: Sydney is an easy city to walk around. If you are looking for a gym, the hotel does have a fitness center, located on the 21st (top) floor. It has an elliptical machine, treadmill, bike, rowing machine, and dumbbells up to 10 kg. Internet: While there is internet access in the room, it is pricey. On the lobby floor are three computers that offer internet at the cost of $1 for 20 minutes time.

The room was really clean and had everything you needed. The bathroom, though small, was very stylish. They had certainly made very good use of a small room by using mirrors to make it feel bigger. The hotel itself is not amazing by any means - the staff were friendly but slightly inexperienced, however this was not an issue and we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any problems with the hotel or the staff. We were staying on a B&B basis and the breakfast wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t great.

It was slap bang in the middle of everything, the furthest we had to walk was about 15 minutes down to the Darling Harbour. The harbour bridge was about 5 minutes walk and the Opera House and Botanical Gardens about 10 minutes walk. It was also 3 minute walk to Wynyard Station so excellent if you are using public transport.

My room faced an office building, which was just several meters away. So it had absolutely no view. Strangely, there were no curtains on the window, just a wooden screen that you could slide. The TV was also in the room with a fairly small number of Australian channels. Wired broadband internet was also available in the room, however I cannot comment on it much since I haven't used it. I found housekeeping to be a bit spotty - e.g., one day I had 2 large towels, the next day just 1, the next day 2 again. Similarly, teabags were not always refilled.

The concierge/bell-man was not very impressive. He was very nice, but didn't have a lot of knowledge about the local attractions and restaurants.

From 30th June 2005 it became a Travelodge. ------ I booked a room very last minute (the night before) through a well known Aussie late deal website, and got a room for $99 (40 quid-ish) which is a v. good price for central Sydney on a Friday night. Although living in Sydney at the moment, my husband and I were heading to a gig near the Rocks which we knew would finish very late, so we thought we?d treat ourselves. I rang up the hotel after booking to ask a question on deposits and they were very helpful. (If you don?t want to leave a credit card number at reception on arrival, they ask for $100 cash which you get back on checkout) Anyway, I turned up after work Friday evening to check in, and there was some confusion as hubby had already checked in having snuck off work early (which I didn?t know about!). The girl at reception was extremely polite and friendly and didn?t seem to mind us being so daft. Apparently hubby had left his mobile at reception earlier, and they?d brought it up to straight away having rung to check it was him who?d left it there. We were given a large non-smoking room which overlooked the CBD. A bit traffic noisy but you can?t expect much else if you want a location in the city. As mentioned in previous reviews, the Travelodge (previously Corus up to the end of June 05) is just outside Wynyard station, and within 10 minutes walk of circular quay. It?s an excellent location for tourists. For non-hotel snacks, there?s a starbucks next door (and a krispy cr?me about a minute down York street if you want seriously sickly stuff) and the main shopping Streets (George and Pitt) run parallel. The central shopping area is about 5 minutes walk away. The room itself has obviously recently been overhauled. It?s a mixture of old (the bizarre wooden ?blinds? that you have to haul across the window, the peeling windowledge, and the old fridge) and the new ? all the fixtures and fittings (cupboards, desk, chairs, table, lamps, bedside tables, pictures) looked brand new. We had a double bed and a single bed in our room. The bed was very comfy with nice crisp sheets and there?s an extra pillow in the cupboard. The carpet was clean, although didn?t look brand new. You also get an ironing board and iron, and a safe. There are the usual coffee/tea making facilities. The fridge is useful, especially if you?re staying longer (there?s a small Coles supermarket in Wynyard station for supplies) The TV has foxtel, and there?s an internet connection if you need it. Overall I was very impressed with the room, certainly for the amount we paid. The bathroom was desperately shabby, although a letter on the desk explained they were in the process of renovating, so I expect they?ll get around to the bathrooms at some point. There was nothing at all wrong functionally and it was spotlessly clean, but the paint was peeling, the ceiling above the bath a bit mouldy, and the bath itself cracked. The shower head above the bath was bizarrely low, so that it touched my head (and I?m only 5,5) My husband had some trouble since he?s 6 ft tall. It was still perfectly adequate however, and the little touches made up for it. For instance there were loads of lovely fluffy white towels ? far more than we actually needed, and you?re given all the nick-nacks you?d expect and a couple more. I was particularly pleased that you got individual shampoo AND conditioner rather than that showergel/shampoo stuff. Plus body lotion, sewing kit, razor and gel, shoe shine, sanitary bag, shower cap, soap, box of tissues and extra loo rolls. The hairdryer was obviously old, but at least had some power in it, unlike some that sort of waft a soft breeze around your head. I can?t comment on room service or the restaurant facilities as we didn?t use them but I would hope its as efficient as reception were on check-in. I did note that they have a customer coin-op laundry which is great if you?re staying a few days since you don?t have to pay silly amounts to your smalls washed by the hotel staff. There?s a gym too apparently. They?re doing a ?winter warmer? dinner deal at the moment for $16 I think it was (I can?t tell you the details because we ate out ? sorry) The Travelodge is probably a 3.5 star hotel in my opinion ( I don?t know the actual rating because it varies depending on the site you visit). I am rating it highly because I found the staff to be extremely courteous, friendly and helpful, and I thought the standard of cleanliness very high. I've only knocked a mark off because the bathroom could have been better. I?ve stayed at 4 stars which are nowhere near as good, and at 3 stars which are way below this standard. I recommend it if you want a shopping trip followed by a night out in the Rocks (there are some lovely little outdoor restaurants) at a bargain price (the other hotels in this area are vastly more expensive) We were in 1301.", "Date": "August 16, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cLook elsewhere if looking for nice hotel at a value price\u201d", "Author": "Darren7676", "ReviewID": "UR3744805", "Content": "Hotel is full of coach tours, which unfortunately for them they won't know any better.
