The hotel personal kindly arrange a place in the other one not far a way. But the quality is less (IMHO). The second reservation was ok. But the room is missing: bathrobe, slippers, a bottle of free water, TV mostly in Spanish. The breakfast is unbelievable expansive (18 EURO + 8% TAX) for one. Around the conner in the restaurant you can pay for the same for 2 persons 13 Euro. Sometime there was a bad smell from the bath drain system.

The general appearance in the lobby is one of a modern, and sleek hotel, bu the cracks really do show when you get to your room. Ours was on the third floor, overlooking the main entrance street. The carpet had numerous unsightly and questionable stains and was like office carpet - with no underlay making it not relaxing to go barefoot on. The glass screen in the bathroom was broken, exposing a very sharp edge, and worse of all, the air con blew out a steady stream of warm air, which you couldn't turn off! The corridor outside out room has no ventilation whatsoever, making it a very muggy and uncomfortable wait for the elevator. The staff were friendly and courteous, and the hotel is located fantastically just off the Passieg de Gracia, about 7 mins walk from Placa Catalunya and the top of La Rambla.

The location was great really, away from all the hype and buzz of les Ramblas, but close enough that we could pretty much walk anywhere we wanted. We got on of the bus tours- the name escapes me, which was fantastic. We got on it a few minute walk away from the hotel. We went to Guelle Park on the tour which was brilliant and also went to the Nou Camp Stadium- amazing!!!We did have to queue for a while though so be prepared for that, and make sure to bring lots of water on the bus AND DRINK IT!.... I made the msitake of not drinking enough water and suffered majorly the next day after going out for a few drinks that night- not a good idea. We also got the train to waht we though was Stiges, but we actually got on the wrong train- the inspector was not impressed, but we didn't know. We ended up going to a different beach near Garraf which was lovely. On the food front, we went to the Hard Rock Cafe, good food and good service. We also found some smaller places on the other days which were also very nice. We went to see the European Athletics Chamionships which were great. We also took a lift across the city and up towards the stadium where the athletics were held- I wouldn't advice it if you're scared of heights. I'm not afraid but felt very shaky on this!! Very hot temperatures there when we were there, but definately a place I would go back to!Brilliant. The rooms in the hotels were great- air conditioning, black out blinds. The view wasn't great but we were barely there! The reception staff were always very helpful and we were able to leave ourr bags the final day as we weren't leaving until later that day.

The one thing I did not like was the bathtub which had a very small glass screen and having a shower meant water was going all over the bathroom floor but loved the fact bathrooms have a bidet!

I and 4 of my other friends were given rooms on the 8th floor , at first I thought - Great, until we had to take the separate lift - more like a service lift - only big enough for 2 people with luggage and very very slow! On reaching the 8th floor, the corridor was very hot (certainly not air conditioned) we made our way to our room and were dissapointed. The room was very tired and shabby, a total contrast to downstairs, it was also very small and cramped - even after I had asked in advance for a larger superior room as it was for 3 people. Nothing appeared to work, not even the brand new TV - perhaps that was why it was so new!! I even called down for someone to fix this but no-one ever arrived. The shower was rusting and had little power and some of the bath towels had seen better days. On another note 2 of my friends had a room on the 4th floor with balcony and said it was very modern and comfortable and they were very happy indeed. Overall for our needs, the hotel was perfect and had a great little street cafe that was a nice place for all of us to meet - a bottle of Cava for 12 euros and for the morning great coffee and pastries.

The location is within walking distance of many excellent eateries, public transportation, 3 of Gaudi's unique buildings, the famous La Rambla and some great shopping in the Eixample area. The hotel also offered an optional Continental breakfast which was a little pricey but with a good variety and generous refills of coffee.

I immediately called the front desk and within minutes a very apologetic young man came up and showed us three very nice options. What a difference!! In the end we accepted a lovely, sixth floor room at the front with a king bed, nice decor and large, beautiful bathroom. We were never disturbed by traffic noise while we were there: the hotel is at the top of the Ramblas in an up-market shopping district and is especially quiet during the week.

The room has a feel of cheapness to it that words can not describe. It seems that only minimum effort has been put in to just keep the room just livable. The carpet is stained and old, you can see the walls are cheaply plastered and painted in a rush, the furniture probably wasn't changed since the 80s. And the fact the room cleaning staff probably spend the minimum effort does not help the cause either. Our used glasses/mugs are left totally untouched and not replaced, the hot water jar we got from room service are still left behind.

The hotel is situated by a number of places of interest including Casa Batillo, stylish restaurants and bars. Passing traffic did make it a little bit difficult to sleep to begin with but it didnt last long. We did not eat at the restaurant but did have a drink in the downstairs bar before venturing out to the city. I had both a wonderful time and I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a fabulous place to stay and a romantic break - my partner actually proposed during our stay there!

The hotel itself is stylishly presented and in a perfect location right in the heart of the shopping district - literally a stones throw away from the beautiful Passeig de Gracia, a short walk to Las Ramblas, La Segrada Familia and the several Gaudi buildings in the surrounding area. The bad bits..... On arrival at the hotel beware of the lift situation. Previous reviews (which I was grateful for) had warned about the lift if you are staying on the 6th, 7th or 8th floors, and they were right! As we were staying on the 7th we had to take this particular lift and as a result had the most claustraphobic, frightening trip I have ever encountered to reach our floor. The lift was so small you could only fit one person plus luggage into it and it took an age to reach its destination. TIP: If you are staying on the 6th, 7th or 8th floors, take one of the nice big glass lifts (why do they only go to level 5?!?) to the 5th floor and then walk the two or three flights to the upper floors. Trust me its safer! Our experience of the Hotel Alexandra was also unfortunately overshadowed by noise. We complained after our first night that we had been disturbed by noise from two other rooms on our level (kids running up and down the corridor screaming and slamming doors at 1am, 2am etc) The staff apologised and said it wouldn't happen again. Unfortunately it did, the next night from the same rooms. At 3am when we had all had about as much as we could take I contacted reception who apologised but did nothing to resolve the situation and just said \"Well they are leaving soon anyway\". We were also checking out early (6am) and did so after having a second night of very little sleep. We informed the staff on checkout again of the noise issue and they just shrugged in their usual unfriendly way. They really didn't care. Next came the battle with the car park. If you are considering driving to Barcelona and leaving your car at the Hotel Alexandra - DON'T. Not because its not safe, but because its highly unlikely you will be able to get it back out again without needing a new clutch! The car park is extremely small (almost impossible to manoeuvre an estate car in) and has the most ridiculously narrow steep spiral exit / entrance ramp from both upper and lower levels which is also slippery so difficult for tyres to grip. You are only given approximately 2 minutes to exit this 'assault course' before the electronic security shutter at the top closes again and you are left suspended at an narrow angle on an extremely steep hill that even the most sturdy handbrakes would struggle with. (Someone then has to get out of the car without scraping their door off the wall and climb to the top of the ramp to re-open the shutter). Put it this way, If you think the lift sounds frightening, don't try the car park! It's such a shame that this hotel was a disappointment. It had the potential to be so good. It is extremely unusual for me to complain about a hotel or write a bad review but our experience there was so unforgettable that I feel it is only fair to warn other people. If you are looking for a hotel that's right in the heart of Barcelona, reasonably priced and you're not too bothered about noisy neighbours or unfriendly staff then maybe take a chance and stay here (just don't bring the car). Equally, if it's decent quality service and a good night's sleep that you're after, perhaps it is best stay elsewhere. Whatever you decide to do, make sure you visit Barcelona.

The rooms are clean and comfortable and the shower is good. The negative points are the parking - very badly designed, difficult to manouver. The room service doesn't work 24 hours - actually it is very inefficient. Some staff are very unfriendly - mainly the ladies at the bar/restaurant and breakfast. On the other hand Javier, Esther and Gabriel are very helpful and sweet. The staff is not well prepared to give recommendations e.g. for places to eat. I was looking for a vegetarian or organic restaurant to get something healthy for my 16-month-old daughter to eat (it is very difficult to find non-fried food in Spain or boiled vegetables, for example) and was recommended a chain called \"Fresc Co\" but Javier really tried hard to find more restaurants but the thing is that it seems they are not familiarized with the concept of healthy food, which people working in the tourism industry should be. As a personal tip, f you're really hungry at 3am in Barcelona, I recommend you try Bagoa at Plaza Doctor Letamendi (not far from the hotel) and their jamon canario, delicious!

Finally, my impression from the hotel was that it was renovated recently but it was only a \"facade\" renovation - you can see the furniture in the rooms is old, for example.", "Date": "September 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "cheekyhen", "ReviewID": "UR18975921", "Content": "14 of us stayed here for a hen weekend & our stay was almost faultless.

Check -in was fine, as there was 14 of us it took a while but no longer than you'd expect, plus we were all upgraded from standard to deluxe rooms. Breakfast was quite pricey at 18euros each, but it was a buffet & you could eat as much as you like, so if you have a big appetite, perhaps its good value, and if you didn't want to pay 18euros then don't eat it!... The location was excellent, 5min cab journey to Las Ramblas, which was approx 6-7 euros. Approx 8/10mins cab ride to the Bogatell beach , this was roughly 9-10euros, worth it as we tried the metro & that was a nightmare experience because of the heat!.. I would definately stay here again, the staff were very friendly, one of the nights we all gathered in reception on our way out & we were quite noisy taking photos (as we were on hen wkend) and the staff were more than happy to help take photos & join in...

We stayed in the Alexander hotel during the last week of July 08. The hotel is located near La Pedrera. It is on Mallorca Street which is off Passeig de Gracia. This is a nice area, safe with plenty of shops and restaurants around. There is a small corner shop across the road for groceries which we found very useful (breakfast is quite expensive). The Metro (Diagonal) is a couple of blocks away, just over 5 minutes walk. The top of La Rambla is 20 minutes walk. If you\u2019re arriving from Barcelona Sants train station (train from El Prat airport stops here) get the Metro or taxi to the hotel. Although the start of Mallorca street looks relatively close to the train station on a map, the hotel (no. 251) is near the other end \u2013 don\u2019t try walking it like we did!! Initial impressions of the hotel were excellent. The hotel has a very modern look and the foyer /reception area is nicely decorated. Laptop in the foyer has free internet access if you get a time when it\u2019s available. The corridor to the rooms are also modern and clean. The room was spacious but I was disappointed on first impressions with the appearance. We were on the third floor, room 304. This is a standard room. The furniture looks dated and worn. It has a cheery wood colour as opposed to the dark wood in the rest of the hotel and the photos on their website. There were a lot of areas where the colour of the wood is worn and scratched away (see photos). The carpets were stained throughout and again looked dated and tired. I had a look at the other rooms on the same floor and they looked the same so we didn\u2019t see any point in complaining and trying to get another room. Over time this mattered less as the room was spacious, clean, well serviced and comfortable otherwise. There were no tea/ coffee making facilities which I was disappointed about. The room was air conditioned. The conditioning had 3 settings but the lowest setting wasn\u2019t working. So we had it set at the middle setting which was very noisy, especially at night. TV has a good selection of channels including 3 or 4 english channels (BBC 1 & 2). Bathroom was a good size and has a bath and good shower. Staff were friendly for any interaction we had. We tried eating in the restaurant one night but after a 20-30 minute wait were told that they weren\u2019t serving any more. Didn\u2019t appreciate that too much as we had to rush out before the restaurants in the area closed and we were starving. Even though I may seem critical of the hotel, overall we enjoyed our stay at the hotel and would recommend it. We would stay there again also.", "Date": "August 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cNice contemporary Hotel\u201d", "Author": "BF-UK", "ReviewID": "UR16742860", "Content": "Good location in Barcelona.

The taxi cost about 25euros each way. The lift is amazing with a TV inside, there is a restaurant but we did not use this as we stayed room only and found it quite expensive, there are many really nice restaurants near by. The hotel is about a 10 minute walk from Las Ramblas, the main shopping area, and i would recommend walking rather than getting the train as there are many pick pockets (a woman attempted to steal out of my boyfriends bag and less than a minute later out of my bag) I would defiantly make sure you have bags that are hard to get into and carry them on your front.

The room was clean, very spacious with an extremely comfortable bed however the bathroom was beginning to look tired. The Alexandra is listed as a 4* and was no more than we expected from a central city hotel. We felt secure in the area of the hotel when out walking very late and were always welcomed or reassuringly challenged when entering the lobby late at night. 2 main lifts to the 5th floor then 3 flights of stairs to the floors above or a very scary ride in a small service lift, the only down side but our choice for the high room. Reception staff and bell boys sincere and welcoming and the evening barman a pleasure to sit with. We were concerned with stories of pickpockets and muggings but we had no problems or witness any. As with any city just be sensible and leave the diamonds and gold at home, no handbag and don't flash your money.

We booked through Easyjet and can honestly state that we were hugely disappointed at the star rating attributed to this hotel. In our humble opinion this hotel is in no way a 4* establishment. We booked a junior suite and were 'upgraded' to a suite. The suite was on the 7th floor accessed by the most claustrophobic lift that I have ever experienced. The suite overlooked back yards littered with rubbish. The suite itself was shabby and even with every light in the room on was dark and oppressive. We complained and were moved to another suite. This one was at the front of the building and a slight improvement on the first but for the fowl smell which we eventually identified as coming from the toilet. In the morning we woke to a plume of dust hanging heavily in the air over our bed. This we presume came from the renovations being carried out on the lobby area (something which we weren't told about by Easyjet) and which added to the desolate appearance of the place. We complained again and were moved to the junior suite with balcony which is what we had booked with Easyjet. This was an improvement and by way of apology a complimentary bowl of fruit was sent to our room. The staff is courteous enough but this place has nothing by way of luxury. The towels were well worn and grey and the one time we ate in the restaurant we were the only people eating there.

The hotel is pretty decent, nothing special really. When we were there there was a cosntruction going on in the lobby. Not that it bothered us too much, the workers would separate the working zone from the rest of the lobby with some kind of drapes, but still you could hear the hammer and drill and etc. You would think why couldn't they choose the lower season for this, and not the one when there are thousands of tourists in town. The room was ok, always very clean, plenty of toiletries. The hotel is about 15 minutes walk from Plaza Catalunya, but you can quite entertain yourself visiting designer shops on your way to the center, so with all the shopping it's not gonna seem that long. And of course it's close to different attractions, and Bus Touristic stops. There is no bathtub in the bathroom, just the shower. We had breakfast at the hotel, it was quite good, the same every morning, but plenty of variety (in my opinion): several kinds of cold meat, cheese, cerial, bacon, srambled eggs, fruits, juice, pastries. Price of breakfast was included in the room rate, but usually it costs 17 euros, quite expensive, considering tons of restaurants in the area where you can have breakfast for twice as cheap, an starbucks around the corner. We used room service once on arrival, the food was brougt to our room really quickly, in about 10 minutes, but tasted pretty average.
