We always stay at the RIA. It's on strip 76. we were there for 6 nights. We could not have received any better hospitality than we received at the Ria motor Inn. The owners and staff made us feel at home and their hospitality was the best. Doughnuts juice coffee serial and milk every morning. Along with great advice on getting around Branson, and how to get discounts on tickets, was greatly appreciated. The owners treated us just like family. I would recommend the Ria motor Inn as the best place to stay in Branson, clean easy to enter and leave the parking lot, large pool, great hospitality and best off all reasonably priced.", "Date": "August 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Branson, Missouri", "Title": "\u201ci like to stay there again\u201d", "Author": "therock s", "ReviewID": "UR116678561", "Content": "we were in room 107. room was clean and comfortable beds in it. they had breakfast in the morning it was donut, juice, coffie, serial, milk. we'd enjoy in branson. staff were so nice and friendl. they help me to get in room. value of money to stay at the ria.", "Date": "August 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cNEVER AGAIN!\u201d", "Author": "efkazz", "ReviewID": "UR116518500", "Content": "Oh my!

Screen hanging off back room of the family suite window. Small chidren could easily fall out. Coffee and supplies are extremely minimal. Bed had broken spring. Helicopter ride next door makes a lot of noise if you plan on spending anytime in the room (napping etc.) Walls are extremely thin between floors so you hear the guests above you quite well. It is close to lots of things on the strip and the housekeeper was very friendly, but overall I wouldn't pay my money to stay here again.

The bathtub had a handle missing which exposed two holes in the bathtub. When it was time to go to sleep we pulled back the sheets & found a urine stain on the inside of the sheet.
