This was our 19th hotel stay in around 14 weeks of travel across North America. Overall: A comfortable, modern room, close to Seattle restaurants in Belltown, with a little noise. Probably best for those wanting just a few nights in a good location from Sundays through Wednesdays. What's good: Our room was brightly painted with new, modern decor including a leather foot stool, soft timber flooring, a renovated bathroom with a modern, large showerhead, and a keurig (coffee) machine with a selection of assorted coffees and tea. Towels were the fluffiest we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had at any hotel. An in-room safe was available. Our king-size bed was really comfortable. Pillow comfort is quite personal though we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really like ours \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a heavy style that compress into a hard slope. Heating was good and quiet. Breakfast was not included in our rate and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no refrigerator or microwave in the room. A restaurant on the ground floor provides breakfast and lunch until 1:30pm. We ate breakfast there one morning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c tea/toast/juice ($7), and oatmeal ($5). Breakfast prices were reasonable, and service good. Free coffee and mini cupcakes were available in the hotel foyer after the restaurant closes each day (after 3pm), and a free local newspaper was available at reception. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like packet creamer in your coffee, pick a few small tubs of liquid creamer from the coffee stand in reception for use with the machine in your room. Minor annoyances: Some noise from what we assumed were hotel renovations in progress (black construction plastic on a few windows on the second floor and we were woken before 8am on Saturday morning by intermittent hammering in the building for several hours), major building construction diagonally across Blanchard St (likely for at least the next 6 months), and hotel hallways. The hotel has a policy of putting a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchold\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of $20/day on your credit card to allow for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccontingencies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. We had no problem with the money being released against our debit card, but be aware of the practice. Our room (#533) was on the fifth (and top) floor facing Blanchard Street, more towards the end of the corridor (third last room), away from lifts and a drink/snack machine. The timber floors reflect most hallway conversations, footsteps and slamming doors, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d recommend an ipod or earplugs if you want a peaceful night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep. The weekend nights seemed noisier and busier, with party goers returning early in the morning, and a local football game and bus load of fans as hotel guests also made for a noisy Friday night stay. The building has two lifts which worked quickly, and drink/snack/ice machines are available. Nearby: Top Pot Doughnuts across the road on 5th are a must. Ralph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Grocery & Deli is a few blocks away for cheap and wholesome soups and sandwhiches. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find plenty of restaurants within a few blocks of the hotel, in the Belltown area. Try Mama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mexican for grungy ambience, and good value large-sized mexican meals. Pike Place Market is a great walk of around 5 blocks (try the Russian Bakery and check out Starbuck\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first ever store), and city stores are a similar distance. The Space Needle is an easy, half mile walk. For something unusual/different: Wexley School for Girls is an advertising agency along 5th \u00e2\u20ac\u201c look through their windows; There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s colourful knitting around the trees in the park on 3rd Avenue & Yesler Way/Jefferson St. Transport: Seattle has free buses in the downtown area!", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "crandy84", "ReviewID": "UR121140808", "Content": "This is a great hotel with everything you need for a great price.

We stayed for two nights arriving on November 4th and departing on November 6th. While I would recommend the hotel in the end, there were a few concerns and criticisms I had, which I will address here. I think the hotel has a lot going for it and the pluses certainly outweigh the minuses. However, I would recommend doing your research and determining if the hotel fits your needs prior to making a reservation. First of all, the reviews on Trip Advisor should only be given your consideration if they have been placed since the transition from Ramada to Hotel Five. The latter has only had the property for less than a year, I believe, and renovations and construction are still underway. They were renovating the second and third floors when we stayed on the property. It would be wrong to crucify the current ownership for the failings of the previous folks. They are clearly still working out the quirks and constructive feedback from folks such as us will help them in refining their transition for the better. Anyway, I made our reservation by calling the hotel directly and negotiating a rate. The man I spoke to was very nice. He offered a Fifth Avenue queen for $123.00 per night. The conditions were that by making the purchase more than 21 days in advance I could secure that rate, but I would have to pay in advance and it was non refundable. I did so and originally made a reservation for the nights of October 28th and October 29th. However, a family emergency came up and required that our trip be cancelled or rescheduled. To their credit Pineapple, the owners, were in fact willing to let me reschedule for the following weekend. I truly expected they would tell me I was up a creek and they could care less while keeping my \"non refundable\" money since those were the terms I agreed to. Although, the women I spoke to did add that the rate might change for the alternate dates I was choosing. I had no problem with this, but what I did take offense to was what she said next. She indicated that if the rate were to be higher than the $123.00 I had already paid that they WOULD charge me the difference. However, if the rate was lower, \"Unfortunately we are NOT able to refund any difference back to you.\" So, in other words they have no qualms about asking for more money, but are tight fisted about offering any savings back to the guest. When I inquired further, the representative could not really offer me an explanation as to why this is. Then, sure enough, she informed me that the room I was staying in was available for $101.00 per night. I had surrendered an additional $44.00 for it over two nights. I had read from previous reviewers that the hotel had given them vouchers for the lobby diner during their stays. I was hoping they might offer $10.00 or $20.00 in such to me as a kind gesture given the rate difference, but I had no such luck. Given that they were willing to amend my reservation dates I decided to just take the loss in the end. On the day of the our arrival I tried calling the hotel twice just to confirm my reservation and to inform them of our likely arrival time. To my suprise, and annoyance, I listened to an automated recording tell me to press one button to speak to a current guest and another to make a reservation, then simply repeat itself. What about an option to speak to the front desk? When I called the third time during the drive up from Portland that evening, I finally spoke to an actual person who answered the phone. Check in was easy and the man on duty was friendly. I believe it may have been the same man I spoke with when I made my reservation initially. There are no bell hops, but you can pull right up to the front door with your car. The entrace is covered and well lit. The parking lot is tight and the spots are narrow, but I made it work. The parking rate for guests is $15.00 per night. My only annoyance upon check in was the agent questioned my room rate once more, despite my having pre-paid and the conversation I had had with Pineapple's reservation center. Perhaps I sound like I am being a tightwad here? But, if you were quoted a rate and told it was the lowest rate available. Then, you are sent a reservation confirmation that lists a rate $22.00 per night cheaper, but told that you are out of luck and to consider yourself lucky they were even willing to amend your previous reservation. Would you then be annoyed at the prospect of potentially being asked for pay even more upon check in? While this annoyed me, I do want to add the counter agent was exceedingly polite and professional, even amidst this. He did not attempt to charge me a higher rate in the end, but he did inform me that I should not have been granted a reservation change at all per the terms of my original reservation and rate. I tend to see it differently, as did the woman who made the change for me to begin with. She had said that if someone was seeking to stay at one of their properties as a guest, then their duty should be to try and accomodate that request, not to scold them over fine print and terms. Anyway, one last thing to share is the hotel runs $20.00 per night initially upon your credit card to cover incidentals. I found this reasonable compared to other hotels which block our hundreds of dollars without seeking permission. The room we stayed in, number 517, was nice and exactly as the pictures describe. There is a blackout shade on the window which is nice for sleeping and a second privacy shade which allows for sunlight. Everything in the room was nearly new. We enjoyed some television in bed after gorging at the Cheesecake Factory the second night. Although the cable channel selection is very basic and limited. There are also no in room pay movies, nor dvd players. The counter agent did mention to another man checking in prior to us that they are working on the adding the former amenity, I believe. There is a nice single cup coffee maker in the room with plenty of supplies, ice bucket with accessories, and complimentary bottled water. The washrooms are quite nice. They are tiled with dispensers of moisturizer, soap, shampoo, and conditioner. The shower had a nice cascading shower head which was to die for. There was also an in room safe, which I appreciated and utilized. There was a hair dryer, iron, and ironing board. We called the desk for extra coat hangers and they brought some up almost immediately. We used the complimentary wi fi each day. Now, with that said, when I said to do your research and decide if the hotel is right for you, this is what I was referring to. The rooms are newly renovated, artsy, and it is clear the owners are putting a lot of work into the place. However, I could honestly see how the property would not be for everyone. Some folks are bound to find fault. One woman we encountered in the elevator one evening made the observation of, \"They are a lot like dorm rooms, aren't they?\" The property is not a five star. No bell hops, room service, continental breakfast, etc. If you want that drive six blocks or so south and stay at the Westin. The rooms are not large. This is where I think the comment of the lady in the elevator fits in.They suited us fine as a couple, but if I were travelling with a family or children I would be hesitant, even with a double. Our room had a bed a small desk area and one plush chair with a small ottoman. There is not a lot of room to stretch out. What this property truly has going for it is the location. We left the car idle all weekend and walked everywhere. The monorail passed by our window and I truly loved it. I would perhaps recommend a Space Needle view room, but avoid the courtyard on the backside and the city views are limited as well. Ask to face fifth avenue or the needle. Also, try to get a room on the top froor if you can. Our room looked almost window to window into the passing monorails, which I enjoyed for watching the people. The Top Pot Donuts a block away is adorable and a must see for the ambiance and a cup of coffee. The historic Cinerama is a block away as well. We walked to the shopping district and even to Seattle Center and the Ride the Ducks easily. We even walked to Pikes Market and to Capital Hill for nightlife. The latter took about fifteen minutes. We took a taxi back from the hill one evening and walked the other evening without incident. Seattle does has a problem with aggressive pan handlers and mentally ill homeless folks accosting tourists verbally, but we never felt unsafe, even at 3:00 a.m. And, we saw none of this near the hotel at all. It is more of a problem in the shopping blocks. Case in point, the Cheesecake Factory is a magnet for such activity in. There is a visible police presence in the downtown area though. We saw many, many police officers. Finally, other than the annoyance about the room rate, I would say my only other true criticism was the room cleanliness. By this I mean the room was clean, but not deep cleaned. The floors are tile in the bathrooms and hardwoods in the rooms themselves. The issue I took was with the amounts of dust I found in every cranny and covered area of the hardwoods. I discovered this because upon check in I did what is an unfortunate must when staying in ANY hotel these days, which is inspect the room for any signs of bed bugs. Thankfully I found none at all! However, under the bed was filthy with dust and their bunnies as well as all around the room where the baseboards meet the floors, under all of the furniture pieces, etc. When I removed the cushion from the chair it was a mess of crumbs and whatnot. It appeared the crevices had never been vacuumed. I was not saying the room was filthy with grime and unhygienic. That was not the case at all! However, if you have ever had a bedroom with hard wood flooring you will know what I mean. Periodically you need to vacuum and mop underneath the bed and in every last inch of every place. In your living room you have to vacuum our your couch and chairs once in awhile. If I were the housekeeping manger I would insist upon a deep cleaning of every room, not as part of daily service necessarily, but upon the turnover from one guest to the next that included thorough dusting, mopping, and vacuuming. Finally, I was very disappointed to also notice there was no encasement upon the mattress or boxspring as a preventative measure to stop the unwanted invading bed bugs. I do not think the hotel has a problem with such. Let me stress that. However, I would have liked to have seen evidence that, given the growing problem it is becoming and the amount of work they are putting into the property, that the hotel is taking a proactive and preventative approach to protecting their guests and their investment. Little things like this and the dirt and dust in the room are what prevented me from giving this review five stars. Thorough cleaning and regular inspections of their newly renovated rooms to protect their guests and investment would make me a definite repeat guest. I recommend this hotel be upon your short list of potential choices in Seattle. Just see if it fits your needs logistically and be sure to negotiate your rate.", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bay Area, CA", "Title": "\u201cFunky surprise\u201d", "Author": "James B", "ReviewID": "UR119735319", "Content": "Stayed 3 nights this September.

The new decorations are hip, funky and trendy. We had a beautiful view of the city from our room (you can pick a city view or Space Needle view). The location is central to all tourist attractions, which is really nice. The downfall of the rooms is that you can hear a lot of noise between rooms and in the hallway. The only bad thing that happened was when we checked in. We were told we would get one night free for every three nights we stayed (meaning two free nights for our six night stay). However we already got an early booking fee discount and you could not combine the two offers.

I have traveled extensively and Hotel Five is a real diamond!! Upon arrival the service from staff was fantastic and this continued throughout the whole stay, they are a credit to the hotel. The hotel is a boutique style but that's what we like - the service is much more personal and standards much higher than the larger chains, which normally don't give a damn. We stayed on their 3rd night free deal (see their website for details) so actually got 2 of our nights free which was incredible value - but they went a stage further and although it was advertised as a room only rate, upon arrival we were given $20 vouchers for each day of our stay to use toward food and beverage at Max's Cafe ($140 value!!) - Truly awesome!!! And with the most expensive item on the menu at $11, we ate breakfast or lunch free except for a few bucks tip - well deserved for the great food and service. Location wise the hotel is great, walking distance from the Waterfront, Space Needle, Downtown, Westlake and the Light Rail stop for the Airport is a mere 4 minute, 3 block walk!! Oh, not forgetting Top Pot donuts almost next door, which you simply have to try!! The decor of the hotel is very modern, retro style with bold colours - so I guess maybe not to all tastes but we loved it. The rooms are light, airy and well equipped and the bathrooms simply fabulous, although no bath tub but large walk in shower. Our room had a flat screen brand new TV, air-conditioning, free tea and coffee making facilities, safe, iron and ironing board, telephone with voicemail and a very comfortable bed with plenty of pillows. On top of this, fresh bottled water was free in our room everyday and WIFI completely free throughout the hotel. We did experience a little noise at times from the corridor and some street noise - but it was minimal, and absolutely no different to any other hotel I have stayed in. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough as a boutique hotel, if you want hotel facilities such as gym, healthclub, swimming pool etc then this is not the place, but hey, that's reflected in the low pricing!!! I have seen this hotel rated as low as a 2 star which is ridiculous, but the lack of facilities causes this, not the quality. If it had a quality and value rating it would be a 5!!!! This hotel is getting an undeserved lower score, due only to the fact that it used to be a rubbish Ramada and has received poor reviews back then - this is so unfair.

It's in a great location, close to Downtown, the many restaurants of Belltown, and the Waterfront. In regards to people saying it's a sketchy area, I think that it is more up and coming than a bad area. We felt safe even when walking home at night (although I'd never recommend walking alone in any city at night). The decor of the hotel is very modern. The lobby was large and inviting and free coffee and mini cupcakes were out often for guests. We stayed in two different rooms since we went to San Juan for a night in between (and they happily held our luggage for us for the night). The first room was a 4th floor queen room right outside the monorail, which is literally the quietest form of transportation. You couldn't even tell when it went by! The second room was a king room on the 5th floor. Pros: Keurig coffee maker with choice of coffee, decaf, or tea, Rain shower, Free Wifi, friendly front desk, great location, clean rooms, interesting decor Cons: Slow Wifi (especially in my 5th floor room), Safe in 3rd floor room didn't work, I wasn't a fan of their highly fragranced shower products, absolutely no spot to hang towels in my 5th floor bathroom, painting over bed was missing in my 5th floor room, itchy comforter, limited TV stations I think they might still be finishing their renovations, which is was the painting was missing, but both rooms I stayed in were clean and comfortable.

It also included $20 breakfast vouchers for two each morning at their inhouse cafe, where the staff were friendly and the breakfast very good.

The problems we encountered were so excessive that I don't know how the owners can justify the hotel or it's management. The next morning I discussed our situation with the manager 'Julia' and she stated that if we didn't like it we could checkout but a refund for the unused nights takes 7-10 business days to process. I requested a full refund and she told me we used the room for 1 night so we weren't justified for a full refund (we had a 7 day reservation). The beds were terrible and lumpy, same with the pillows.
