It was a sudden booking. Since the location and the price seems good, I booked this hotel just 1 day before. I was quite excited when I know this hotel location was a prime location. But when I checked-in, I was stunned by the un-friendliness of the front office staff. She asked for my passport, as if I had been a visitor from an isolated island. She just said \"PASSPORT!\" \"PASSPORT!\", meanwhile I greeted her and spoke to her with my very good articulated English. I was quite amazed when she gave me a metal key, instead of the Key Card. In this time?? The hotel with high floors building? Still using the metal key? that's very un-secure, isn't it? Well the rooms: The door couldn't be opened full since the alley for the door was too narrow. The furniture were very old and worn out. They need a total refurbished. The carpet real color is already un-noticeable since it was very very worn out and too old. At the first time, I was quite entertained by the new LCD tv installed on the wall, but oh no...they only have 3-4 local channels, news the whole time and no satellite channels at all. Some of the channels were even scrambled. When I was about to use the free wifi, as told in their compendium book, I was asked the password. Then I called the operator asking about it. Gosh I was waited for more than 5 minutes by the operator, just to tell me back the internet was not actually free of charge. And I have to buy voucher to use the wifi facilities. The Air con sometimes works very well especially at night, until it is freezing. But sometimes not working at all. Luckily I spent a lot of time outside the hotel. The bathroom : It was a luxurious hotel for the late 80's. Not for now. It is already outdated with further renovation. They have big toilet bowl that can't be flushed, outdated bath tube with unstable hot water supply. The circulation in the bathroom was very bad, so if you used the toilet bowl to do the No.1, the odor will stay there for quite a long time. Disgusting. Well actually there is a positive thing about this hotel.Even the restaurant was quite tiny, with very limited tables, with quite limited choices of menu, the served quite delicious dishes. And as mentioned above again, the restaurant need total renovation, it seemed like the end of the 80's restaurant, with gloomy wall and old decoration. Luckily the location was good. Getting taxi is an easy things, Food and supermarkets were around the area. Getting everywhere from this location was easy. The conclusion is : If you don't expect the a new nicer hotel, and only use this hotel for sleeping and keep your eyes closed for the facilities, because you are aftering for good location. this hotel is your you.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bandung", "Title": "\u201cThe Standard room is very very small\u201d", "Author": "astiarjan", "ReviewID": "UR126080191", "Content": "This is my second stay at this hotel...it was on Feb 1-2, 2012.

The hotel is very basic but the staff were very nice and helpful. There was no problem with check in. My friend had arranged the booking before we left for Singapore and there were no problems when we arrived at the hotel and we were brought to our room right away. The room was very small and even though there was a window, it had no view since the window looked out to another wall. There was a small TV but no cable and the only decent channel to watch was Channel News Asia. But why spend all day in the hotel room watching tv when you're on vacation right? There was also a mini fridge but nothing inside - for you to use if you'd like to buy your own water, food, etc. from the 7-11 right across the street. We had two single beds which were ok in size, clean and quite comfy. The bathroom was very clean too! There was soap in a soap dispenser by the sink and shampoo in a dispenser in the shower. The shower is kind of small but no complaints as the water pressure of the shower was very strong. They also served daily breakfasts at the Thai restaurant in the hotel but we never got to try any of it. With so much good food in Singapore though I wouldn't want to be eating Thai in the restaurant. In terms of location, it is about a 5 minute walk to Bugis St. and Bugis Junction where the closest MRT station is. There is also a bus stop across the street and a taxi stand right outside the hotel. Just up the road a bit is Sim Lim Square where you can check out electronics and a food court at the basement with really good chicken rice for only SGD3.50. We didn't use the hotel internet but I don't think there was WIFI. I saw 2 computers in the lobby though that I think guests can use, though I don't know if there is a fee. There are a lot of internet cafes nearby for quite cheap (up to SGD2/hour). Also up the street are hawker type places too! Overall, this hotel was ok. If you want a clean place just to sleep in, then Summer View is an ok hotel. But I think there are better hotels which are bigger for the same or even a lower price.

Room size is okay (not as small as expected), and generally clean - except the toilet and bath tub which were turning moldy, with patches of cement \"filings\" here and there. In addition, room is not soundproof and we were kept awake at night by the late-night \"activities\" next door.

The location is reasonably good - the Bugis street MRT station is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. In Singapore, this is about the distance you can walk without starting to sweat provided you're young and reasonably fit. A 24-hour supermarket is close by and there are food courts and restaurants within a 5 minute walking distance. We requested a non-smoking twin share room with a window. The room (or indeed the hotel) didn't smell smoky, and the room was clean and odour free. The view from the window was of the backs of surrounding buildings - not as bad as a brick wall 3 feet away, but not scenic either. We were on the 8th (top) floor however - the view further down would be worse. Note that the hotel does have some rooms without windows, so make sure you specify that you want a window to avoid feeling like you're in a dungeon. The hotel seemed reasonably quiet at night, although again this may be different on the lower floors. There was a notice stating that guests weren't permitted after 10pm (to keep the ladies of the night away) - we certainly didn't see any. Note: The trip-advisor hotel facilities icons indicate that there's a swimming pool. I didn't see one (although I didn't know to look for it). Given the building size, I find it doubtful that there is a pool. The furnishing in the room and the hotel generally were starting to show their age - the decor might have been fashionable in the 1970's! The bed sheets and towels were clean, and the carpet appeared clean enough, although it looked like it might have had some stains in the past. There were several minor complaints: The door handle for the bathroom wasn't working properly, making it hard to open. The remote control for the TV didn't work, and the TV itself was a small (22 inch?) CRT which only received about 10 channels with reasonable reception. The shower was very difficult to adjust to a steady temperature - most of the time it produced either cool or scalding hot water. Service was reasonable, which appears to equate to 'good' relative to other people's experiences of Singapore Hotels! Free wireless internet is provided, although I didn't try it so I can't comment on reliability. Overall, we found the room to be adequate. It wasn't fancy by any stretch of the imagination, but it was clean, and tidy. If a hotel room is simply a place to have a shower and sleep, you will be satisfied, but if you want anything beyond rudimentary you'll have to look elsewhere. In the week that we stayed, the new Hotel Ibis opened directly across the road. According to a TV news story, the room rates started at S$148, similar to what we paid to stay in Summerview hotel, and the rooms looked much nicer. Although this rate is probably introductory, I feel Summerview hotel will nevertheless have to either quickly drop its rates, or spruce up its rooms a bit.", "Date": "February 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel in a great location\u201d", "Author": "tshirtontour", "ReviewID": "UR24539119", "Content": "We recently stayed at the Summerview Hotel. The hotel is located on Bencoolen street which is a long wide street with a one way traffic flow \u2013 left to right. The street has shops, restaurants and hotels running down it sides and the area is worth a browse. The area is safe to walk around at all times. The Summerview hotel fronts out onto Bencoolen street. Out of the hotel entrance, turn left and walk a few minutes to a set of traffic lights. Cross here and you are into Bugis which is a lively market and shopping area. The hotel is not central to Orchard Road which is the main street in Singapore. It would be a thirty minute walk from the hotel but with the MRT and bus service nearby getting to Orchard Road is easy enough to achieve. A ten minute walk from the hotel will bring you to Bugis MRT station via Bugis market. There is a taxi stand outside the hotel so hailing a cab is not a hassle. The hotel lobby is compact and bright. The corridors and elevators were clean. The hotel carpet has seen better times and could do with replacing. Check in is done without any fuss and you will find the staff competent. The reception staff appear to be not open to small talk but maybe it a language issue rather than being impolite. The hotel housekeeping staff are very friendly and go out of their way to bid you good morning. Our room was located on the firth floor and comments are based on our allocated room. The room was small but fine for two persons. It had a good size bed, a desk, two chairs and a large wardrobe. Furniture was in good condition but dated. There was a small fridge in the room which was in a clean condition. The television set in the room was small and carried local channels. There is a tea/coffee making facilities in the room but if you like regular tea/coffee it would be wise to bring your own tea bags/coffee sachets as you are only given two tea bags/coffee sachets and a charge will incur if you request more. The bathroom was compact and spotless. Because of its size only one person could use the bathroom at one time unless the other person was taking a shower. The water supply was good and hot water was always available. The bathtub is very high so care has to be taken stepping out of it. The shower controls were low on the wall so operating the water temperature dials can be tricky if the water is flowing. One thing to be mindful of is that at the entrance to the bathroom there is a low step. If you forget the step as you enter/exit the bathroom you will almost certainly stub your toe or worse, trip. Towels are supplied and changed daily. Housekeeping is prompt and very efficient. Even though our room was on the fifth floor and facing the road we were not troubled by traffic noise. The hotel itself is quiet at night aside from the usual hotel corridor traffic. Breakfast is served in the D\u2019Lemon Tree caf\u00e9 which is adjacent to the hotel reception. On checking in you are given breakfast coupons which can be redeemed at the caf\u00e9. Breakfast is served 7.30am to 10.00am but after 9.30am food supply decreases. Getting a table can be struggle if the breakfast rush is on which appears to be from 8.45am onwards. Breakfast is buffet style and for such a large hotel is very small and limited. It offers four hot items, tea/coffee, juice, toast (which you make yourself) and fresh fruit. Overall, the breakfast on offer is average but it fills the void until you next meal. Remember, in Singapore you are only a plate throw away from food so you will never go hungry. The Summerview attracts mature couples and families so there is nice friendly vibe in the hotel.

With a taxi stand and a bus stop right outside the front doors and the Bugis MRT station a casual 10 minute walk away, the hotel's location certainly served out purposes well. Checking in was very quick and we were suprised to find that the hotel had placed our 4 rooms very close to each other (including an adjoining door for ourselves and another travel companion). We were also located on the 8th floor which is the highest, but there were no great views from our bedroom or the hallway windows. We were given a standard room, which came with a double bed and some modest furnishing, including a small TV (which had several local and international channels - no movies though), a couple of chairs and a small table and desk. There wasn't a lot of room to swing a cat, but we didn't expect much as we really were looking for a place that was in a good location and was reasonable in price and clean, which it was. The bathroom was a bit of a struggle. The bath/shower was very deep, which meant that you had to be careful every time you stepped out of the bath, and I imagine that if you were not exactly fit and agile, you might find it a bit of a struggle. The toilet was located behind the bathroom door, which meant that every time you wanted to use it, you had to do a bit of a dance to get around the door. The hotel also uses shampoo and soap dispensers, rather than little vials and boxes for your conveniences. Breakfast was provided every morning, but after the first morning, we preferred to go out and have breakfast elsewhere. The restaurant is a very small place and just about every morning we walked past (including the first morning where we waited a little while for a table) there were always people waiting around. The breakfast selection was also very minimal, although they did have the usual toast, cereal, baked beans, and a variety of local dishes including noodles and rice. As the hotel is not very big, we did not encounter a lot of staff so I cannot comment on their service too much. But housekeeping was fine - they cleaned and tidied the room everytime we left the sign up and checking out was again a very swift experience. There was some renovations going on whilst we were there, but it rarely disturbed us as we were very rarely back in our room during the day. We had some issues with our air-conditioner. The coldest we could set it was about 20 degrees and any amount of adjusting or tinkering didn't change the temperature. And since it wasn't an unbearable temperature, we just decided to put up with it. As I mentioned at the beginning, the hotel is very well located. For all the computer and electronic geeks, Sim Lim is located only a 2 minute walk away and for the serious bargain hunter, Bugis market is only a 5 minute walk away. And if you're after a bit of air-conditioning shopping and a few more name brand stores, Bugis Junction is only located another few minutes further (along with the MRT station).

Her name is Mya. The hotel was recommended by our travel agent due to its great location and 3 star rating. We were also informed that it was supposed to be a new hotel, and its standards similar to the Allson Hotel. Based on my travel experience, I strongly feel that Summerview does not deserve the 3 star rating, mainly because the facilities' conditions are terrible and the rooms are not \"designed guest rooms\" as stated on their website. Most importantly, however, we were not treated well as guests. For example, it took around 15 rings before the hotel's operator would pick up our call and whatever we requested never arrived at our room. In addition, I was asked to carry my own big suitcase to my room when I checked in because the hotel did not have any porters at 2300. Upon my check out at 0730 on Sunday, when we called for a porter, the phone was answered rudely by Mya (after almost 10 rings) who asked my elderly parents and I to carry our own bags (in total, 10 bags). She also wanted to know how many people there were in our party and had the audacity to suggest that we could always go up and down the lifts, carrying the luggage, two pieces at a time since there was no porter at that time ! Although we understand that certain hotels do not employ 24-hour porters, we do expect their staff to assist us in other ways, such as providing trolleys etc for our use. When I explained our predicament to Mya, she still refused to suggest any other ways to assist us and insisted that we carry our own bags (despite the fact that I had already earlier explained to her that I had 10 pieces of luggage, elderly parents and two very young children). Her most discourteous reply was, everyone carried their own bags in the hotel, so why couldn't we do the same?? The worst part of our experience was definitely the treatment accorded by Mya. When we complained that the service was bad, she said that she did not need our business, as the hotel was always full with guests from other countries and she didn't need business from Malaysians. In addition, she has also verbally abused my father, calling him \"kurang ajar\" which means \"ill-bred\". When we asked to speak to the manager, she then informed us that she is the person in charge there and is equivalent to a Manager at that time. She was constantly trying to verbally abuse my father during the entire ordeal and it was embarassing as there were other guests in the lobby at that time. Another receptionist was there at that time by the name of Wendy and she quickly ushered Mya to the back office and tried to calm my parents because as they were extremely traumatised by the incident and Mya's outrageous behaviour. I will be writing to the hotel management and also copy the said letter to the Singapore Ministry of Tourism to report the incident. We have no doubt that the hotel location is very good and although we have acknowledged that that certain facilities are not up to par, at the very least the service accorded by the hotel's staff should have made up for its shortcomings. Much to the contrary, we were subject to the likes of Mya, whose behaviour was inexcusable, and should be subjected to disciplinary action which I hope the management will take against her, for the sake of the reputation of the Summer View hotel.

This is a budget hotel so do not expect any special service from the staff. If you simply need a room to stay while in Singapore then consider the Summer View Hotel. The rooms are very clean and the beds are alright, definitely well worth the money. Forget about the breakfast. Instead go outside and enjoy the local food. There are plenty of restaurants around and the area is great (Bugis). You can even walk to Orchard road if you like (15mins \u2013 20mins) or use the nearby MRT. This is an ideal location if you are a vegetarian like me. There are so many full vegetarian restaurants in the area partly inspired by the \u2018Goddess of Mercy\u2019 temple just opposite the hotel. The whole area has good vibes and it\u2019s very pleasant at night. Almost like a little china town. Ask for a room with view (facing the temple), otherwise you might end up without a window or facing the car park. Overall this hotel is worth it if you are on a budget (quality is above average for the price). The cleaning crew is very good and the hotel seems well taken care of. I usually stay in Orchard road and not in budget hotels. Staying in Bugis this time was great for a change and I find this hotel well worth the price and can only recommend it!

Most of the 3-star hotels were fully booked and I had to settle for this hotel. The usual room rate is S$90 per night and I had to pay a surcharge of S$20 per night. Rooms: Rooms were not big; but pretty functional. My room was on the 4th floor with a queen size bed. The window faces the duct. The room and toilets were clean and housekeeping was okay. No toiletries provided (except the liquid soap). A tiny TV, complimetary coffee/tea making facility and mini-refrigerator is also provided. Breakfast: Breakfast was included. You get toast, butter, peach-jam, egg, sausage, rice/noodles, coffee, tea, fresh cut fruits and fruit juice. I'd rate it okay-for-a-budget-place. Location: The hotel is next to Sim Lim Square and Burlington Mall. Access to MRT is a problem. Bugis MRT is a 7 min walk; Little India MRT is 8 mins walk and Dhoby Ghaut Interchange is 15-20 mins walk. In Singapore's hot and humid climate, this can be taxing at times. Access from Airport: On arrival, we took the MRT from Changi Airport to Bugis followed by a short walk to the hotel. On departure, we took the taxi service provided by the Hotel. It was a Merc Van and could comfortably seat 4 of us and carried all our luggage. (Cost: S$35) Overall Analysis: A good place if you are looking for budget accomodation. You should be able to get a double room for S$80-S$90. In that respect its value for money. Would I stay here again: Not likely. I'd rather prefer some 3-star hotel very close to an MRT station.", "Date": "March 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milton Keynes, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cYou get what you pay for\u201d", "Author": "BritDownUnder", "ReviewID": "UR3896131", "Content": "I had no particular problems with this hotel.
