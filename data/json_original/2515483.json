The hotel desk staff could not have been friendlier. Check-in was no longer than 2 minutes. All the pictures you see online are very close to the look and feel of this location. The only handicap room available was located on the first floor and at the back of the hotel. Breakfast was great! All food was either hot or cold as appropriate. Prior to night coming, I would give this location a 10. With all that said, here comes the bad news! The hotel backs to both the train and trolly tracks! Readers take heed, this hotel could not have a nicer staff, cleaner facility or be more accomodating... but if you are needing a good nights sleep... that will just not happen. Yes the front desk staff tried their best to be comforting such as providing as many ear plugs as needed. But that just was not enough. Every 10 to 30 minutes some sort of train or trolly came by. What do I mean some sort of train? There were a variety of forms such as Metro line, Amtrack and the worst culprit, the working trains. Metro and Amtrack stopped sometime near 11 PM, but the cargo trains work all night. The final straw was when I woke to the room trembling. I yelled \"Earthquake\" then as the trembling stopped, the rumbling began and I yelled \"Tornado\" but then remembered oh we are in San Diego, then don't have tornados. Just about that time and RIGHT IN FRONT OF OUR HOTEL WINDOW, the train whistles began. What time did all this happen? 2:30 AM! No getting back to sleep for us and all this with a full day of work ahead of us. I went to the front desk and notified them about this at 3:00 am. They were gracious and attempted to find a different room for the next night, but also stated the entire hotel can hear and feel the trains. When I said that would not do, they offered to call a different Residence Inn. They did, and found us a perfect one, quite and we left later in the morning. All in all over the top in nice people, way below in ability to get rest.

The room was clean, spacious, and easily suited our larger group. There were two bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a pull-out bed in the living room. The complimentary breakfast in the morning was above average and hot portion (e.g., eggs, fried potatoes) especially good. The hotel is next to Little Italy and a 30 minute walk (or $10 cab) to the gaslamp area and the convention center. As others have mentioned, it's near trains but they didn't keep us awake or anything. All of the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. We had three surprises that were bad, good, and neutral: 1. The hotel website lists a manager's reception but it's actually only Monday to Wednesday. This was a disappointment because (in part) we chose the hotel because of that. Staying Wed-Sun meant we missed it. 2. A welcome surprise was the hotel's free shuttle that will take you anywhere within three miles and pick you up too. The drivers were friendly and prompt. This saved us a lot of cab money and certainly made up for item #1. A very special thanks to the front desk staff and shuttle driver who were working the morning of January 29, who retrieved a lost cell phone from our room and shuttled it to the airport. Above and beyond! 3. I asked the front desk to call a taxi, but after getting in the car we realized it was actually much more expensive than a normal cab ($35 to the beach vs. a $20 taxi ride home). When we complained to the front desk (i.e., we had asked for a normal taxi not a luxury car) they said the hotel was trying out a new cab service that claims \"luxury cabs at regular taxi prices\" but they were quickly finding out that claim wasn't true. So, the hotel refunded the difference in fares! Great customer service there, and special thanks to Ian at the front desk who took my complaint and was very understanding.

We were very impressed with the size of the 2 bedroom suite. Full kitchen and 2 bathrooms. We booked in advance and requested a room not facing the train tracks and we did get this. We did not hear any noise in our rooms of trains. The staff were very friendly and helpfull. Complimentary breakfast daily and light dinners mon-thurs were quite a treat.(beer and wine included) They had a cozy fireplace by the pool where you could relax. WE had the pool to ourselves as no one else was using it on the nights we were there. The trains do come by behind the pool and we sure got a chuckle of the noise it was like a movie lol What we really liked about this hotel is they offer a free shuttle within 3 miles of the hotel. We could leave our car behind and avoid finding locations or parking. Every afternoon they had fresh baked cookies at the front desk for guests. The shuttle drivers were very friendly (Mark and Gerardo) who made our trip special. WE got a good rate by booking 8 mths in advance with AAA but If I had to pay $299 a night like some were I would be disappointed as this was too much for a hotel room. We would definatly return as the location suited us very well. The Saturday farmers market to walk to in Little Italy was fabulous. The trolley train is only a block away if you wanted to take it to go shopping or other attractions. One negative was that I saw a dog out on a balcony and if I had allergies I would be making sure I requested a room that is pet free!

My son and I were there for Comic Con. We had been placed on a wait list for a hotel that was nonsmoking and this was the only that had any space. The room was spacious and very clean. The accommodations were as represented in the website photos. The staff was very nice and courteous and responded quickly to any of our requests. Unfortunately the hotel is close to the train route. I am a very light sleeper and have insomnia so it was near impossible for me to get any more than a few hours of sleep. The first few nights I heard the train at 6:19 am and then 20 minutes after that well in advance of when I really wanted to wake up. On Saturday night in addition to the 6:19 am noise from the train, I heard the train at around 1 am. So I can not in all honesty recommend this hotel to anyone who has any issues with noise for sleeping. Even my 11 year old son who is a very heavy sleeper woke up due to the noise. I would not have booked with them had I known about the proximity to the trains. Another issue was the lack of wifi access to the internet. (Not a big deal and they did have instructions on how to connect). One recommendation would be to also include instructions for Apple systems (instructions only were for Windows). The only option was to use a ibahn cord located on the desk. The internet connection was not high speed at all. The average download speed at best was around 0.58 Mb/s for download and average 0.40Mb/s upload speed.

Yes, I am here in San Diego for Comic-Con. I am one of hundreds that stayed in this sold-out Residence Inn during Comic-Con 2010. While most will be basing their reviews on a $200+ per night room I am basing mine on a $149 per night room as I got in right before rates were raised. Most of you reading this review will be booking this hotel at the streamlined rate. I came into San Diego a day early and stayed one night at the Courtyard Marriot located across the harbor at the Airport/Liberty Station. It is a spectacular Marriot and you can read my review of it on TripAdvisor. I was very concerned when upon my second night in the city I came to the Residence Inn. It doesn't look nearly as nice from the outside, and when I saw an Amtrack train running directly behind it, I thought I was going to be miserable for the rest of the week. Looks can be deceiving. This was my first time at a Residence Inn so I didn't know quite what to expect. When I opened my room door, my jaw dropped. Here was what amounts to a mini apartment. You have a kitchen with microwave and refrigerator, a living room and a bedroom that is separated by a wall in some rooms, and in some others is not. I was fortunate to get a bedroom with a wall separation. Bed was very, very comfortable. I slept soundly. I have never been in a hotel room like this, and really, it's a wonderfully roomy little suite. Where this hotel really exceeds is the little extras that you get. In the morning there is a free hot breakfast that is quite good. There's eggs, breakfast potatoes, french toast or pancakes, oatmeal, waffles, muffins, cereal and doughnuts. There's coffee and a soda machine that also has apple and orange juice. It really is a nice little spread. On Mondays - Thursdays from 5:30-7:30pm there's free food in the lobby. I only was there one night during at that time and they were serving up hamburgers, hotdogs, beans, potato salad and potato chips. It was pretty much as much as you wanted though I am sure the hotel would appreciate no-one making a pig of themselves. Oh, did I mention there was free beer on tap as well? ...and, yes, free high-speed Internet in the rooms! The clerks as the front desk were always very friendly and helpful with our questions about the area. In fact, they were most helpful in holding a room for my colleagues and I as we got into town very early in the morning and were driving to LA. They blocked out three rooms for us and when we got back late that night those rooms were available to us. There is a nicely sized pool on the premises and a fire pit that is lit at night to provide warmth to the couch chairs that surround it. Very nice touch. Now here is the big question that all of you have on the forefront of your mind.... How bad is the train situation? The answer is, very bad. There is an Amtrack train and Trolley that runs seemingly non-stop directly behind the hotel. The Amtrack is blowing its horn throughout the day. At night the train seems to blow shorter/quicker horns in an effort to be less annoying at those hours, but it still must run its horn to warn anyone at the crossing gate nearby. To be honest, it never woke me. Then again, my room was the other side of the hotel. But you know what? It doesn't matter where in the hotel you are, the train is right there. If you slept during the day I could see the noise being a problem because it's like Grand Central Station behind the hotel. At night, not as busy. The hotel does supply you with a set of earphones. You can talk about how bad the train situation is at this hotel, but from all the reviews I read about the Hilton and the Marriott down by the Convention center, they both have the same train problems. In fact, it would be very hard to find a hotel close to the water that doesn't have train service nearby. If anyone looking to save a few bucks and stay at this hotel during a convention such as Comic-Con, I have great news for you. The Trolley station is right around the corner. The walk is under 5 minutes and you simply take the blue line to Americana Place and then switch to the Orange line to the convention center. During big events like Comic-Con there is express train service that goes directly to the convention center without transfers. So, all in all, I found this to be a wonderful hotel. I mean, you get free breakfast which is a real plus. Certainly, they don't have to put out free food in the evening...but they do. It's those little added touches that have already made up my mind that this will be the first place I look to book next year when I return to San Diego for Comic-Con 2011.", "Date": "July 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Antonio, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat family atmosphere\u201d", "Author": "mari042", "ReviewID": "UR70536195", "Content": "The family had a great time!!!

It is literally right next to a set of train tracks that carries frequent passengar and freight trains as well as San Diego's light rail trolley system. The train noise is bearable if you are in the front of the property. But if you get stuck in the back, overlooking the tracks, expect lots of noise and 2 or 3 large trains in the middle of the night which pass through with horns blaring due to the numerous road intersections they have to cross in the neighborhood.

We thanked them for that but we wanted a room where we could open the windows or have a balcony (only have a French balcony) so we waited for a different room (329). They stored our luggage and we went to lunch in Little Italy at a place called Fillipo's (okay food). We returned and our room was ready by 1:30. The hotel has a shuttle and they really only take you about three miles from the property but they were very accomodating and took us to/from the zoo (over three miles). All you really have to do is reserve the shuttle and they will take you or pick you up. I took the shuttle to the convention center each morning and they also took us to the Old Town Transit center a few times. The noise. Yes, there is noise but it's not what it is made out to be by some reviewers. The trolley comes by numerous times per day and the noise it makes is more like background noise. It's a bit noisier when the Amtrak train comes through but it's not something that would preclude you from staying there. Breakfast is very nice and the evening reception is welcome. Wednesday is a BBQ night where the manager (Jonathan) cooks and serves burgers and dogs. It's a friendly evening. The rooms were nice and clean although there should be more mirrors other than the one by the sink. Pool -- nice but the sun doesn't hit it much past 5:15. Overall, it was clean but it needed some TLC by the rim. Staff was quick to act when one of the children threw up after swallowing some water. The pool was closed, shocked and vacuumed. Smoking is a problem for those of us who don't smoke. Smoking is only allowed outside by the pool but the smoke seems to linger since there isn't much air circulation. The staff is friendly and goes out of its way to help. I would definitely recommedn this to anyone.", "Date": "August 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, NV", "Title": "\u201cWould stay again despite the train noise, standard Residence Inn\u201d", "Author": "baseballfan53", "ReviewID": "UR38674016", "Content": "We stayed here two nights in a one bedroom suite.

The view of the waterfront was its best at night. We had read previous reviews of this location and were concerned about \"train noise\" as reported from other advisors. While we did hear some noise from our room - it was never enough to be \"bothersome\". In fact, when we stay in a different city - we welcome the neighboring noises that make each location unique. (I have to point out, however, we would have been disappointed to hear sirens or heavy street traffic. This was NEVER an issue at this location. When I say \"never\" - there was not one siren heard while we were in our room. Can you say that about other \"downtown\" location of any city hotels?) Breakfast (included), was plentiful and varied for each of the 4 mornings we were here. (They could stand to expand the seating area a little though. But, having said that - we were here in Feb and the temps were a little chilly in the a.m. - so morning breakfasts normally seated alfresco were a no go). Even with the chilly evenings, the heated pool was a welcome treat for our 6 year old who has never met a pool she hasn't liked. Tops on our list, for this location, was the shuttle service. With a little planning (calling ahead to make sure the bus was not previously occupied), we were able to get to Seaport Village, rental car offsite location, ferry marina, and airport without paying taxi fees. (Plus, the conversation from the drivers was always much more pleasant than that of the typical \"cabbie\"). Our room was perfectly appointed with updated furniture and decorations. Bath areas and sink area were always spotless. (Our housekeeper even left us a little treat for Valentines Day). We like to bring home with us when we travel so that our well-traveled daughter acclimates comfortably and we were pleased when her \"things\" were left exactly as she left them at the beginning of each day. (Yes, some hotels like to move your things where they think they should be and it always seems a little unsettling. It's little things like this that impress us). This location had a little courtyard surrounding the pool with lounge chairs and a fire pit.

I knew about the train and was prepared to deal with a few passings. I guess seeing the ear plugs on the bedside table set me up to expect the worse. I remember reading that the trains stopped in the night. I didn't think that. I remember hearing trains passing as late as 11pm. My husband, my 5 year old and I rented a studio suite and were for the most part happy with the set up. The color scheme was fresh looking and we had an ocean view opposite of the train tracks. The best part was that we arrived early and called the hotel and they let us check in early. This was even during the labor day weekend. Upon entering the room my husband was really impressed ( i think it was the blue and yellow color scheme). I liked the set up of the kitchenette along with the pull out sofa, desk and chair. There was also a double door that lead to a \"balcony\". I use that word loosely because I would not feel safe standing out there on the iron railing. But having the door open with the ocean breeze blowing in was a long forgotten fairytale. Now the problems....I couldn't get the feeling that I was in a really olddd place with a new paint job out of my mine. I felt as if the room was screaming at me to please like it. I could see chips and cracks and bad patches peeking throught the vibrant blue and yellow paint. The bathroom was sanitary but the walls seemed slightly discolored. The pull out sofa seemed dingy to me and left me wandering who sat there the night before. So much that I really didn't want to sit on it. After pulling it out and putting on fresh clean sheets that thought left my mind. The kitchen and dishes were clean and I would've had no problem using them. Sleeping at night was pretty bad for me. The bed was way too hard for my comfort which is probably why i was so sensitive to the train at 11pm. I asked my husband about it and he said he liked the bed. 'Upon waking,we had breakfast which was pretty hotel standard (and great) and then we walked the boardwalk and really enjoyed our time including the USS Midway. While walking the boardwalk I was contemplating what ifs....what if we stayed at a different hotel downtown? We'd still have the same problem with the trains and the airplanes so it was not the Marriotts fault. The downtown place is a great place to stay for night owls and partyers. There were people hanging out on balconys on other hotels as well that night.

We needed to stay at a hotel which accepts pets and was close to Chula Vista - without being in Tijuana. Through the hotel's website, I booked a two bedroom suite (one room for the adults, one for the daughter, and one for the son with dogs in one room). I could've done two rooms next to each other but the teenagers don't want to share a room, much less a bed. After a late arrival - we got started driving late - I was greeted by \"we were overbooked and sold out of two bedroom suites.\" This meant the boys took one room and the girls another, not a totally acceptable choice but on a Friday night in the San Diego area with pets you've either booked ahead or you sleep on the beach.. The rooms are actually quite clean and well appointed, with each having a dining area, full (ish) kitchen, and a queen size bed and pullout couch. Be warned, however! They provide ear plugs for a reason. You cannot get closer to the railroad tracks without getting run over, and it's not just city trains or cross-country trains, it's both. There's only so much you can do to block out every-few-minuts train noise and horns. The next day, we were moved to the suite (not the most convenient activity but better than the arrangement we had). The suite was equally clean with the same decor. There were two queen beds and a pullout in the common room, which was again outfitted with full kitchen. Earplugs had to be retrieved this time from the front desk - facing away from the trains and towards the bay did not help much. The bathrooms were decent sized but the vanity in one room was large enough for two sinks (though it contained only one) and the other vanity was barely wide enough for one person (though the room had more closet space). Showers were effective and shower heads were high enough (I'm 6'1\" and they usually clean my chest but not my head without ducking down). Towels were smallish but still a little soft. The complimentary breakfast buffet was not the usual carbo-only feast, featuring not only the usual doughnut/bagel/bread/ceral choices (add pancakes to the carb side of the equation) but also had sausage patties and eggs. These were, unfortunately, almost inedible. The sausage was peppery, a little greasy, and (odd for ground meat) tough. The eggs were so over cooked it was like eating rubbery rice. I didn't try the coffee (Starbuck's was right around the corner). The toaster was a commercial run-through which is convenient, but was set to a speed that gave only a slight warming once through. There was a couple kinds of yogurt and some fresh fruit (apples, bananas, oranges) as well. I would stay here again, though the prices were a little high, because it's close to SeaWorld and to our dog show, but I'd make it perfectly clear on the phone with them that I have specific reasons for booking the suite, not just because I want a big room, and that if their reservation center is going to overbook I would be very appreciative of them not giving away my room.

The van will take guests anywhere within a few miles, so I signed up a couple of times to get back and forth to the Convention Center.
