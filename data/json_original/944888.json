My guests complained about their services, and when I was there to settle my guests bills, the front desk staff was rude and she wasn't honest. It took her almost fourty minutes to clear my guests bills. Clearly their staffs were not professionally trained. I was greatly disappointed, with the price that I paid for 2N, I should have considered placing my guests at Westin instead. I would not recommend anyone to stay at Guxiang 20.", "Date": "Nov 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR984333310", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Ianne_Loh"}, {"Content": "Happy time in the Hutong beijing Have two night in Beijing Guxiang 20 after a two week traveling in northeast of China. The hotel is located in Beijing ancient residential area which called Nanluoguxiang. It is quite difficult after driving through a one way Hutong to find the small botique hotel. The check in is quite quick and I booked the forth floor room come with a big balcony. This is a good surprise. Very clean, nice rooms, excellent service. Must commend the concierge staff as they were helpful through our whole stay. The hotel bar at the restaraut is quite nice and would recommend drinks some cocktail there. But there is a little bit disappointment that the staff can rarly speak English and I found it is difficultly to order the food when I having the dinner in the restaurant.Anyway, It is quite nice time during my last stop in Beijing China. Hope to come back this brilliant city again.", "Date": "Oct 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR890820587", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Piki_S"}, {"Content": "Good one day, disappointing the next       Entrance to the Hotel", "Date": "Jun 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR349163371", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "trif589"}, {"Content": "the small hotel in Beijing       guestroom", "Date": "Jan 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR305290725", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "xbay21"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d944888-r22767187-Beijing_Guxiang_20_Hotel-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "944888", "Price": "$112"}}
