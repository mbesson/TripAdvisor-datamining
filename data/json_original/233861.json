I have to admit that I have never experienced such a poor and inefficient service in a hotel that claims to be a 4-star property. I had booked a two-night package that included breakfast, 2 one-day travel card, and a welcome drink. Upon arrival, check-in was expedited but no summary about the package was given to me. It is only when I got to my room and got ready to go to the city center that I realized that something was missing. I went down to reception and I informed a Receptionist that I had not been given the travel cards... I thought it was inappropriate to ask for a so-called \"welcome drink\" that I have not been served 'til day ! Eventually the receptionist handed over two travel cards without apologizing and without any comment. She only spoke in German to her colleague while attending me. This would have been just a small incident if I had not been through the worst: laundry service. I gave two T-shirts to be washed and ironed on my day of arrival. Although aware that laundry is delivered the same day if handed over before 8:00 am, I picked up the phone and asked for my laundry to be picked up. I was shocked by the answer: \"you have to give to reception before 8.00 o'clock\". I explained that I was aware of this, adding that I would stay for two nights. I also mentioned that as long as it is delivered the day after, it was fine. The lady repeated that I had to go down to reception the following morning before 8.00 am !!! I am sorry, but this is not the type of sentence any paying guest wishes to hear - especially if you want to sleep some extra hours in the morning! I eventually found a housekeeping supervisor in the corridor ay 1.00 pm and explained to her again that I wanted my laundry bag to be picked up for a delivery the following day in the afternoon; to which she said with a smile \"ok, no problem\". At 6.00 pm the following day, I decided to call reception and ask about my laundry which had not yet been brought back to my room. The receptionist asked me to hold on, as she was going to inquire. She then told me that my laundry bag was still at reception but my T-shirts had not been washed! She repeated that I had to bring it myself before 8:00 am. She then cut me off justifying herself by saying that the laundry control sheet clearly mentioned that it was to be delivered ... (guess what) ... before 8.00 am. She also mentioned that it was too late now to do anything !!! Extremely upset by her attitude and I immediately went down to reception. I asked to see the General Manager, but she said that the General Manager was not in the house. Upon insisting, she said \"we are going to wash your T-shirts. They will dry overnight here and they will be ready before you check out\". All in all, 1) no one had informed me about this situation 2) No express solution was offered; i.e. the hotel could have contacted another hotel in the city to have my clothes washed 3) I had no more clean T-shirts for the last evening, 4) I have never been addressed to in this manner by any hotel staff in my life. I am particularly disappointed and appalled for not having been taken seriously. This is totally unacceptable from an international company. It simply disregards the most basic etiquette.

We stayed here for 4 nights in a party of 8, spread over 5 rooms and there were no compaints from anyone. Two of the rooms were upgraded, but all rooms were of a good size, beds and bathrooms were good. The staff were excellent and always helpful. It is a one minute walk to the Hackescher Markt eateries and train station and a 5 minute walk to the Berlin Dom, which is one of the nicest churches I have seen outside Rome. We did two great tours. One, a walking tour of the Third Reich and the other a bike tour of Potsdam. I would love to return to Berlin, and I would definitely stay at the Alexander Platz Hotel.", "Date": "July 7, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "NH Berlin Alexanderplatz", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d233861-Reviews-NH_Berlin_Alexanderplatz-Berlin.html", "Price": "$72 - $213*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Landsberger Allee 26-32</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10249</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "233861", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/ae/65/ce/aussenansicht-nh-berlin.jpg"}}
